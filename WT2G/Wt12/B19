THE EVERETT MASSACRE.<br>
<br>
Vernon H. Jensen, "The Everett Massacre," <B>Lumber and Labor.</B> New York: Farrar and Rinehart, Inc. 1945, p. 122-24.<br>
<br>
In 19I3 the International Union of Shingle Weavers, Sawmill Workers and Woodsmen was formed, with J. G. Brown as president.  In February, 1914, a demand for the eight-hour day, supported by a 
threat of a strike on May <B>1 </B>if the demand was not granted, was vigorously opposed by the employers, who made an aggressive attack on the union and succeeded in operating their mins on an "open-shop basis.<br>
<br>
A number of locals asked the executive board to hold a referendum on the strike question.  In its stead, a special convention was called which decided to try to secure at the Washington polls in November the enactment of the eight-hour initiated measure.  The bill was lost, and the action of the union in threatening a strike and then deciding to trust to political action was the tuming point in the union's history.  The membership began to fall off.  The<br>
<br>
Shingle Weavers had had their fill of attempting to organize the 
lumber workers, and in <B>1916 </B>reorganized themselves on their original basis.  Concurrently, the sawmill and camp workers organized into a new union, the International Union of Sawmill and Timber Workers, with E. E. Wieland as president.<br>
<br>
The dedine of the I.W.W. led to "stocktaking" of its organizing plans and tactics.  The I.W.W. had operated through organizing meetings and the formation of locals in the towns in which the lumber workers congregated when out of work.  It was hoped that the men would become tied to the local and not to the job.  But the isolation of the producing centers and the distances to the camps proved a great disadvantage.<br>
<br>
A new plan of organization was evolved about 1914; it aimed at the establishment of a few permanent central branches, with a secretary in charge and a delegate on each job to sign up members.  The job-delegate system proved effective.  If the "bull o' the woods" got "Wobbly horrors" and fired the delegate, or if the delegate quit, it was easy for the I.W.W. to replace him and continue its work.<br>
<br>

The vigorous campaign during <B>19166 </B>to revive the organization among the lumber workers developed stiff opposition at many places.  A free speech fight at Everett resulted in a bitter tragedy.  The fight followed upon an A.F. of L. Shingle Weavers' strike which 
began on May <B>i, </B>igi6, after a failure of the operators to raise wages voluntarily according to the terms of an agreement made a year before.  A bitter internal quarrel of long standing had kept the union in turmoil.<br>

Although the term was not then current, "quickie" strikes called by I.W.W. sympathizers within the Shingle Weaver local were of common occurrence.  The operators were so enraged that they would<br>
have  nothing  to  do  with  any  union,  which  meant  a  refusal  to   deal with the A.F- of L. Shingle Weavers.  As the strike wore on, I.W.W. up the town" to leaders decided to secure a hold in Everett to "open up the town,"  union organization.<br>
<br>
The Shingle Weavers, under th leadership of E.  P. Marsh, had encountered obstinate resistance from the employers but had not invited the assistance of the I.W.W. I.W.W. meetings had been frustrated and many members had been arrested and deported to Seattle, which led to the resolve to carry on the free speech fight.<br>
<br>
On October 30, forty-One I.W.W. supporters left Seattle by boat for Everett.  There they were met at the dock by sheriff-led vigilantes.  After being beaten, the men were taken to the outskirts of town, where they were made to run the gantlet between rows of vigilantes who wielded clubs.  Although there were no fatal casualties some of the men were beaten until they were bloody.<br>
<br>
These were the tactics which open-shop leaders up and down the region were advocating to get rid of the unionists.<br>
<br>
A second effort to carry men to Everett in order to assert the union's right to hold meetings was attempted by the I.W.W. when the Verona, with 260 men aboard and accompanied by another vessel carrying 39 men, set out from Seattle on November 5, 1916.<br>
<br>
Sheriff McRae, a former shingle weaver but no longer sympathetic to the union, and bitterly opposed to the I.W.W., received advance from the Pinkerton agency and lined the dock with 200 armed vigilantes.<br>
<br>
When the Verona was made fast McRae demanded that the leaders be pointed out.  This was refused, and upon the sheriff's command ten minutes of shooting followed when the men attempted to disembark, after which the boat backed away<br>
<br>
In addition to the five I.W.W. members and two vigilantes killed, thirty-one I.W.W. members and nineteen vigilantes were wounded.  The I.W.W. contended that all the shooting was done by the vigilantes whose cross fire from three separate groups struck down all the men hit.<br>
<br>
The charge that the men on board the ship had guns was never adequately proven.<br>
<br>
When the boat returned to Seattle all its occupants were placed under arrest by the Police of that city, and seventy-four were held on murder charges.  Feeling ran high.  Mayor Gill courageously
denounced the vigilantes as murderers, ordered improved treatment of the prison oth the Seatdc ers, and held his position under threat of recall.<br>
<br>
Both the Seattle Labor Council and the State Federation of Labor 
denounced the Everett authorities and urged an <B>locals </B>to give 
support to the I W W. The trial of the first defendant <B>resulted </B>in 
acquittal, after which the other prisoners were <B>released.</B><br>

<B>EVERETT<br>
<br>
</B>Gordon R. Newell, "Everett and the IWW," <B>Ships of the Inland Sea.</B> Portland: Binfords and Mort, 1951. p. 179-182.<br>
<br>
Everett is a Puget Sound city with a more turbulent history that most of her sister ports. There, in the Spring of 1916, violence flared into a bloody battle in which two members of the Mosquito Fleet were involved, winning a place in history at the cost of broken rails, bullet shattered windows and blood stained decks.<br>
<br>
The IWW movement had started in the Pacific Northwest in 1905. The then radical organization found enthusiastic followers among the loggers and migratory workers of the Puget Sound County. By 1910 its slogans, "Industrial Workers of the World," "Workers of the World Unite," and "One Big Union," had become familiar, stenciled on stumps and boulders or on skid row buildings.<br>
<br>
Known contemptuously as "Wobblies," the holders of red card were the object of fear and contempt on the part of the more "respectable" element. When they undertook to organize strikes, the forces of law and order began suppressing the movement with forthright brutality. The Wobblies countered with soap box speaking campaigns. The law of free speech was overlooked, but when speakers were hustled off to jail, new speakers took their places. Before long many Pacific Northwest cities had no more room in their jails and the soap boxes were still manned.<br>
<br>
When the IWW tried these tactics in Everett, the industrialists of that city resorted to more direct action. Instead of sending the Wobblies to jail, they loaded them into automobiles and took them out of town. There they were beaten with "devil's club" an ugly swamp shrub with long sharp spikes, or made to run the gauntlet of clubs and pick handles swung hard by husky vigilantes.<br>

The IWW took this punishment for five months and managed to organize a strike of Everett shingle weavers. Then the Wobblies organized an excursion which they described as a "free speech demonstration" but which the Everett Commercial Club called "...an armed invasion of the city."  That's where the Puget Sound steamers <B>Verona</B> and <B>Calista</B> came into the picture.<br>
<br>
On Sunday, November 5, over 300 Industrial Workers of the World left Seattle on the two steamers. The <B>Verona</B> had a capacity crowd of Wobblies aboard. The <B>Calista</B> followed with the balance of the demonstrators plus the regular Seattle to Everett passengers. According to which side of the story you listen to, they were either armed to the teeth or had only a couple of pistols among them; were either cold sober and well behaved or roaring drunk looking for trouble.<br>
<br>
Everett had been notified of the steamers' sailing and Sheriff Don McRae was planning his defenses. He deployed his forces, well armed, along the dock and in the waterfront buildings.  Early in the afternoon, the white propeller steamer <B>Verona</B> was seen through the low lying mist of the outer harbor.  One of the many sawmill whistles cut loose in a long, hoarse roar that echoed and reverberated from the wet, brooding hills around the city.<br>
<br>
At the alarm, the law officers and vigilantes checked their rifle loads and thousands of Everett citizens made for hillside vantage points from which they watched the ensuing tragedy performed.<br>
<br>
Slowly the <B>Verona</B> steamed toward the dock, her decks black with Wobblies singing their favorite battle hymn "Hold the Fort." The decks were jammed. One young fellow had climbed to the top of the steamer's flag staff from which vantage point he waved his hat jauntily at the silent crowds ashore. Out in the harbor the smaller <B>Calista</B> was seen dimly through the mist as she drifted in the <B>Verona's</B> wake. As the <B>Verona</B> slid in toward the dock the sheriff raised his hand to silence the chanting Wobblies and shouted to the captain in the pilot house.<br>
<br>
"You can't lead here!"<br>
<br>
The captain's answer was drowned out by the great shout of defiance from the steamer. As the bow brushed the pier a man on the dock looped a line over a bollard.<br>
<br>
Then it happened.<br>
<br>
From somewhere a shot blasted out. Who fired it, whether it came from the ship or from the shore, has never been proven. That first, inevitable shot was followed by a moment of dead silence. Then seething, roaring hell broke out. For the next ten minutes Everett's waterfront saw violence never equalled before or since.<br>
<br>
Screaming men on the <B>Verona</B> crumpled to the deck as the volume of fire from the dock swelled to a crackling roll. Up in the pilot
house, Captain Chance Wyman,  saw the first of some 175 led slugs tear into his sanctum. One of them took a wrist thick spoke from the hardwood steering wheel. Captain Wyman retired to the lee side of the ship's iron safe and remained there for the remainder of the battle.<br>
<br>
As bullets whined and thudded into the ship, the fire was returned.  Deputies ashore began to fall back wounded. Panic gripped the men on the <B>Verona</B>; the crowd stampeded for the off side of the steamer, out of range of the murderous fire from the dock.  The <B>Verona</B> heeled far over until it seemed that she must capsize. Then a section of the rail gave way and a dark cataract of struggling men poured into the misty water.<br>
<br>
Fire from the dock and from the American Tugboat Company's <B>Edison</B> whipped the water around the struggling men to red foam. Most of them sank from sight.<br>
<br>
Slowly, as in a nightmare, the steamer righted somewhat as men moved into the cabin to fire from shattered windows and doorways. As slack came on the single blow line, it was cut. bullet riddle, with blood dribbling darkly down her white sides, the <B>Verona</B> backed slowly away from the dock with gunfire still crackling from both sides.<br>
<br>
Out in the harbor at last, her captain slowed to warn the <B>Calista</B> off. Then he raced for Seattle with his cargo of dead and wounded men. Back in  Everett, ambulances were clanging toward the dock. When the score was counted, it was found that two Everett deputies were dead. Sixteen, including Sheriff McRae, were wounded. The Wobblies had five dead, thirty-one wounded. Most of the men who went overboard were believed drowned, but in the excitement no one noticed what happened to them.  Few of them had friends or families to be concerned about them.<br>
<br>
The steamers were met at the dock in Seattle by a police riot squad which dragged the surviving IWWs off to jail. Seventy-five of them were held on murder charges which couldn't be made to stick, but the IWW lost prestige in the Battle of Everett.<br>
<br>
By the time the first World War was over the movement was almost finished.  Most of the labor reforms the Wobblies fought for, considered radical at the time, are accepted practices today. Police clubs haven't cracked workers heads for many years but labor violence was part of the new frontier's growing pains.<br>

THE EVERETT MASSACRE.<br>
<br>
Jack Miller, "The Everett Massacre," <B>Solidarity Forever </B><B>Oral History of the IWW.</B> Chicago: Lakeview Press, 1985, p. 108-112.<br>
<br>
The big fight of 1916 developed in Everett, Washington, where the shingle workers were on strike.  The trademark of that work was severed fingers.  Workers had to maneuver a block with the right hand and the shingle with the left in front of a fast moving blade.  The shingle weavers had a small union of a few hundred men, and they had gone on strike because their wages had been cut.<br>
<br>
The IWW didn't have a branch office in Everett, but it responded to the call of the shingle workers for help.  James Rowan, who had been organizing in Minnesota, was among the first to arrive.  When he got up to read the Industrial Relations Commission Report, a document published by the government of the United States, he was taken from his soap box and told he could not speak.<br>
<br>
Now the religious people could talk and any idiot could say the moon was made of green cheese, but it was a "no-nd' to talk about the plight of the shingle weavers.  You see Everett was not built by pioneers; it was planned as a workplace.  The timbermeiys association ran the town and had Sheriff Don McRae doing their dirty work.<br>
<br>
The IWW decided to send a group of speakers from Seattle on October 30th.  We took the regular ferry, and were met at the docks by Sheriff McRae.  He told us, "'Ib hell with the constitution; you're in Everett now!' The word arrest was never used, but they put us in cars and took us to Beverly Park on the outskirts of town.  He had a hundred men lined up on each side of us, his regular deputies and volunteers from the Commercial Club.<br>
<br>
If we had tried to make a break for it, they would have shot us.  What they made us do was run a gauntlet.  They were armed with every kind of cudgel imaginable-sawed billiard cues, billy clubs, small baseball bats, brass knuckles, pistol butts.  As you ran, they clubbed at you.<br>
<br>
I was the fourth to go through.  Other guys had tried holding their coats over their hands but that wasn't much protection.  I tried a new tactic of ducking and weaving.  I managed to get past the first and second pair.  I also slipped past the third, but someone grabbed me by the necktie.  Then I felt a blow on my head and another under my eye.  That's all I can tell you because I'm not sure I was fully conscious after that; I was what they call out on your feet.<br>
<br>
Somehow I got to the end of the line.  I had a small scalp wound and
bruises that lasted for months, and my eye was completely blackened.  I didn't consider this much.  One of the IWWS was crippled for life; his arm was pulled from his shoulder so badly that he could never do heavy lifting again.  There were lots of concussions and fractures.<br>
<br>
We were just left out there.  We had brought very little money with us because we thought the sheriff might rob us, but there was small change.  We put the worse injured on the first interurban car.  The rest of us made it back as best we could.  I caught a freight.  Thirtyone of us had to receive treatment at the Seattle City Hospital.<br>
<br>
We knew that the next time we went to Everett, it would have to be in much larger numbers and in daylight.  Our trip would be advertised extensively.  We had so much support after the beatings that one minister in Everett, with the consent of his congregation, wanted us to come to a park to hold a big public meeting.  I, m not sure how many responded because we took the regular passenger run and we paid the regular fare.  There were about two hundred and fifty of us and an overflow of about another fifty who had to wait for the next boat, the Calista.  We sang all the way 'Hold the Fort:' "Solidarity," and all the other songs.<br>
<br>
I was below deck as we came in for the landing and starting to come forward when I heard a shot.  Sheriff McRae was standing there, one hand in the air and one near the butt of his pistol.  His coat was thrown back so that his belly stuck out way over the belt.  He yelled out, "Whds your leader?" Someone answered, "We're all leaders."<br>
<br>
He said, "You can't land here" Someone else yelled, "The hell we can't Immediately after that there was a volley fired from the dock.  The boat had made a port landing, and there was so much panic with people rushing to the opposite side that the boat listed and many were pitched into the water.  I don't know how many were hit in the volley, but the firing was indiscriminate.<br>
<br>
My first impulse was to run, but I realized that would attract fire, so I walked down to a lower deck.  In case bullets started coming my way, I stacked up two sacks of coal for shelter.  TWO armed men approached me.  One was Ben Legs.  He was full or part Indian.<br>
<br>
These men had the only pistols I actually saw that day.  I told them not to waste their ammunition.  They should watch the outer edge of the dock.  Men stationed there could cross fire the boat lengthwise and every bullet could strike someone.  If a deputy showed his head, they should discourage him.<br>
<br>

But they had a better idea.  Instead of guarding the dock, they located the engineer hiding behind the boiler and told him to pull the boat out before we were all killed.  I couldiyt actually hear what they told him.  There was too much shooting, screaming and shouting.<br>
<br>
I saw Ben Legs point the pistol, and he told me afterwards he had said, "Buddy, it would be pretty hard to miss you from here" So they forced the engineer to go out and back the boat away.  I've been told that once we got moving, the IWWS found the captain in his quarters, which was just behind the wheelhouse.  He was hiding behind a safe with a mattress over his head.<br>
<br>
They forced him to take over the wheel at gunpoint.  All you had to do was look at the pictures of that boat afterwards, and you could see he hadn't been behind the wheel when the firing began.  There were at least seventeen bullet holes in the pilot house.  The odd thing about all this is that even though I was a participant, I didn't see very much.<br>
<br>
On the trip back we saw the Calista and warned them about what happened and they turned around.  Three men were already dead, two of them dying on the way back to Seattle, and we never found out how many were drowned.  The militia met us at the old Coleman Dock when we got back to Seattle.  They marched us to the public safety building and took us through a tunnel to elevators that brought us to the top floor.<br>
<br>
There were so many of us in there that there wasn't room to lie down.  We had to make a system where men would lie partially on top of one another in order to get some rest.  The diet we had was bread and coffee once a day.  That lasted three days and then we decided to retaliate by "building a battleship." This was IWW parlance for doing unpleasant things for the benefit of the jailer.<br>
<br>
Since there were no tin cups or bars to bang, about twenty of us went into the center of the room, locked our arms and jumped as high as we could.  The aggregate weight, which was about a ton and a half, came down in one spot.  Buildings are not made to sustain such abuse and it wasn't long until almost everyone was in the circle.  People who were observing from outside have told me since that the building began to sway.<br>
<br>
The jailers threatened to turn a hose on us, but we said that would make it easier to form a hole for the water to run through.  Then they said we were making it bad for our comrades in the hospital on the floor below who might even be dying.  Someone replied that if those fellow workers heard us fighting, they were likely to get well and come on up and join us.<br>
<br>
No one would die as long as we were still fighting.  The chief of
police came up and got the same sort of replies.  Finally Mayor Gill came and promised better food and some blankets.  The meals did get a lot better, but the blankets were a mixed blessing as they were infested.<br>
<br>
I didn't keep a diary, but I think it was about two days later that the prosecuting attorney came in.  We were never taken before a grand jury and property indicted.  We were charged from information provided by the prosecutor.  He decided to charge fortyone of us with first degree murder.  He spoke very softly.  I walked up close to the doorway and asked him to repeat himelf.  He mumbled, "First degree murder." "Oh, hell," I said, "I thought it was something serious."<br>
<br>
But the reactions among us varied.  We had a cross section in there.  One guy fainted from shock, and there was general pandemonium for a while.  Later, they made the same charge on another thirty-three of us.  They stop ed at that numberbecause the jail couldn't house any more prisoners.<br>
<br>
The ones charged with murder were moved to the brand new and escape-proof Snohomish county jail in Everett.  What they fed us there looked like the swig a farmer throws to his hogs.  We had to build another battleship.  We threw the stew on those fine new wails, and we were able to force the cell doors open.  We couldn't do anything with the tank doors, but we bent the cell frames so they could not be latched properly.<br>
<br>
The fellows downstairs took all the levers from the upper locking system and bent them out of shape.  That cost $980 to repair.  I told McCullough, the man who had since been elected sheriff, that he could have bought a lot of good food for what that battleship had cost him.<br>
<br>
We demanded separate trials and for the first case, I was among the twenty-five witnesses called.  My function was to verify that we had had to use a pistol to get the engineer to back the boat away from the dock.  The crew had simply deserted their posts and left us at the mercy of McRae.  The prosecution never presented any evidence as to how the deputies had been shot.  There were no rifles on board the ship.  We had some pistols, so you can bet your life that if the deputies had been hit by pistol fire, there would have been evidence to that effect.<br>
<br>
We received a lot of support during the trial, which was held back in Seattle.  The Kerensky Revolution had already occurred in Russia and there were lots of emigres who were thinking of going back.  On May 1, a large group went to Mt.  Pleasant Cemetery to pay tribute to the boys who had been killed at Everett, and then they came to
serenade us.<br>
<br>
We didn't know about this until we heard voices singing in the distance.  As they got closer, we realized the song was "The Internationale" being sung in four different languages.  Besides the Russians, there were a lot of Germans and Australians.  Some of our prisoners were Australian, too.<br>
<br>
Well, the people outside would sing a revolutionary song in one language or another and we woud reply with an IWW song.  That went on until dark.  It was one of the most thrilling days of my life.  Here we were incarcerated on charges of first degree murder, and there were more than a thousand people outside the jail singing to us.  We were in a revolutionary upsurge.  Four days after that singing, the verdict of "not guilty" came in on Tom Tracy, the first defendent.  The charges against the rest of us were soon dropped.<br>

EVERETT MASSACRE.<br>
<br>

<br>
Free speech fights consumed considerable IWW energy in the following years, but after 1915 the policy in lumber, as in agriculture, officially shifted "from the soapbox to the job." Duespaying membership fluctuated between ten thousand and twenty thousand a year between 1916 and 1919, but Wobbly power was considerably greater than even these impressive numbers indicate.<br>
<br>
Getting dues collected regularly from isolated camps scattered in remote areas would have been a formidable task for any union, and the IWW was never a model of bureaucratic efficiency.  What its organizers could do much better than collect dues regularly was spread ideas, and the irrepressible idea of the late teens was direct action.<br>
<br>
A dramatic test of direct action came in Everett, a city of some thirty-five thousand inhabitants located on Puget Sound.  Its port was a strategic center for shipping cut lumber, and its hiring hails .,,ruited men for operations in the interior.  On May 1, 1916, over four hundred of the town's shingle cutters went on strike.<br>
<br>
Sheriff Donald McRae began to arrest pickets, and the local sent out a national call for assistance.  Although the shingle workers
belonged to the AFL, which did not respond to their appeal, the IWW sent James Rowan from Seattle to organize a solidarity campaign.  As soon as Rowan got up to speak on a soapbox, Sheriff McRae arrested him and a free speech fight was on.<br>
<br>
After several other attempts to speak in public had failed in spite of considerable local support, October 30th was set as the date for a major effort.  On that day a contingent of forty-one Wobblies went to Everett on the regular passenger ferry from Seattle.  Before they even had a chance to leave the dock area, they were surrounded by a sheriff's posse.<br>
<br>
Shortly thereafter they were taken to a park on the outskirts of town where they were severely beaten.  About a week later another two hundred fifty Wobblies made the same trip, determined to<br>
hold a public meeting at all costs.<br>
<br>
This group was met by a drunken sheriff and deputies who shot into the ferry as it tried to dock.  Some of the Wobblies shot back, and before the boat could pull away there were at least five dead, six missing, and twenty-seven wounded Wobblies.  On the shore, a deputy was mortally wounded, a lumber company official was dead and twenty-four were wounded.<br>
<br>
The Everett Free Speech Fight had become the Everett Massacre.  The immediate aftermath was that seventy-four Wobblies, rather than law enforcement personnel, were put on trial, the typical IWW experience in which the victim was treated as the criminal.  The murder trial ended with a spectacular legal victory in 1917 which served to further fuel the determination of lumber workers to achieve long-sought basic reforms.<br>

EVERETT MASSACRE.<br>
<br>
Jim Klahn, "Labor gathering recalls Everett Massacre of 1916," <B>The Seattle Times.</B> November 10, 1991 p. B-1.<br>
<br>
Missing the boat from Seattle to Everett 75 years ago might<br>
have been the luckiest thing that ever happened to August Anderson.
<br>
But he always regretted not getting aboard the Verona as it sailed,<br>
carrying about 250 members of the Industrial Workers of the World union<br>
toward what would be the bloodiest labor confrontation in Northwest<br>
history.<br>
<br>
"He felt the duty to go," his daughter, Myrna Fisher, said of her<br>
father, who like many wandering workers of the time was taken with the<br>
fiery rhetoric and socialist idealism of the Wobbly movement.<br>
<br>
Fisher, of Port Susan, spoke Wednesday night at a commemoration<br>
marking the 75th anniversary of what has become known as the "Everett<br>
Massacre" on Nov. 5, 1916.<br>
<br>
The Wobblies making the trip were intent on asserting their<br>
Constitutional right to free speech that Sunday afternoon. The well-<br>
armed sheriff and deputy citizens opposing them, backed by wealthy<br>
timbermen, were just as intent in keeping their then-remote town free<br>
of the socialist influence.<br>
<br>
In the gunfight that erupted suddenly when the Verona tried to dock<br>
at Everett - which side fired the first shot remains a mystery - two<br>
townspeople and probably a dozen Wobblies died, city historian and<br>
librarian David Dilgard said. Fifty were wounded.<br>
<br>
In the commemoration, more than 100 people jammed the city library<br>
auditorium to listen to labor historians and sing along, haltingly,<br>
with musicians as they belted out labor protest songs, some dating back<br>
nearly 100 years.<br>
<br>
The invitations said everyone was welcome, but virtually all those<br>
attending wore blue-collar workers' garb.<br>
<br>
Lyrics that included, "Hold the fort, for we are coming, union<br>
hearts beat strong," and depicted bosses as "the rich parasites"<br>
received strong applause. The group Rebel Voices sang "Bread and Roses," a Wobbly original that has become an anthem for the women's movement.<br>
<br>
Mike Sells, secretary-treasurer of the Snohomish County Labor<br>
Council, said the confrontation 75 years ago, as Everett's wealthy<br>
tried to bar Wobbly labor organizers, was "a classic tale about<br>
suppression of people's rights."<br>
<br>
Asking rhetorically why the incident should be dredged up<br>
 periodically, he said it should be a lesson that comes alive to the
community, and to children.<br>
<br>
For some in Everett, the so-called massacre has relatively recently<br>
brought up hard feelings, Dilgard said. During an observance in 1976,<br>
he said, a woman paraded on a sidewalk with a sign reading: "Reds<br>
(Wobblies) fired first. My dad felt it."<br>
<br>
Dilgard said talking with the woman led him to her father, who gave<br>
an account of taking part in the gun battle, as a deputy.<br>
<br>
"There are still those who would rather not remember a day like the<br>
Everett Massacre," said Ross Rieder, president of the Pacific Northwest<br>
Labor History Association.<br>
<br>
Defending the actions of Wobblies as they tried to take their labor<br>
arguments to the streets of Everett, Rieder said, "The U.S.<br>
Constitution is like a union contract. If you don't file a grievance,<br>
you can't complain" about what happens.<br>
<br>
In past commemorations, organizers could depend on the aging but<br>
strong voice of Jack Miller, a Wobbly member who was aboard the Verona,<br>
and was arrested with 73 others after the Verona retreated to Seattle.<br>
<br>
This time, there were only recordings. Miller died five years ago,<br>
at the age of 97. But Miller's Wobbly credentials were obvious to the<br>
end. In a recording taped when he was 93, he said, "The working class<br>
and the employer class have nothing in common."<br>
<br>
He also recounted how the Wobblies were intent on standing up in<br>
great numbers on Everett street corners, to force the hated<br>
shingleweaver-turned-Sheriff Donald McRae and his hired guns to fill<br>
the jails with them until their rights to speak were recognized.<br>
<br>
There was something new in this year's commemoration, however.<br>
Dilgard said the daughter of a former city prosecutor had approached<br>
him a few years ago, and offered an envelope that had mug shots of the<br>
Wobblies arrested after the Everett battle.<br>
<br>
Their faces - showing emotions ranging from cold hatred to fear to<br>
nonchalance - were projected onto the wall one after the other.<br>
Also shown were the pictures of four corpses of Wobbly men, some with<br>
apparent gunshot wounds.<br>
     
There had been trouble brewing for some time before the eventual<br>
gun battle. Some workers were resorting to strikes and many Wobblies<br>
who had gone to Everett in attempts to spread the IWW gospel of worker supremacy had been brutally beaten by McRae's thugs, including being forced to run a gantlet of men wielding gun butts, boots and clubs.<br>
<br>
Many in Everett, then a community served only by rails and steamers,<br>
sympathized with the Wobblies, but others saw them as an upsetting<br>
influence from the outside, according to the book "Milltown," by Norman<br>
Clark.<br>
<br>
His research, considered the definitive work on the incident, could<br>
not pinpoint which side fired first, after McRae warned the Wobblies<br>
they could not land on Everett soil, and a union man replied, "The hell<br>
we can't!"<br>
<br>
In the gunfire that followed, including that from hundreds of<br>
deputy citizens virtually surrounding the Verona, McRae and dozens of<br>
others were wounded.<br>
<br>
The Verona nearly capsized as those aboard ran to one side of the<br>
boat to get out of the line of fire. Some fell into the water and<br>
Everett residents tried to take a small boat to their rescue but were<br>
driven back by fire from deputies.<br>
<br>
The Wobblies eventually retreated and sailed back to Seattle.<br>
The 74 arrested were jailed in Everett, but charges against all were<br>
dismissed after one was acquitted in a jury trial. No legal actions<br>
were taken against McRae and his small private army.<br>
<br>
Tensions remained near the flash point in Everett after the<br>
shootout.<br>
<br>
Historian Murray Morgan of Tacoma said there had been a lot of<br>
support for the IWW, and its strong labor actions, and that continued<br>
after the events in Everett.<br>
<br>
"The next step, which changed everything, was our (U.S.) entry into<br>
the war," he said of the effects of World War I. "With that, the<br>
production of lumber became important."<br>
<br>
The Wobblies lost ground in popularity during and after the war, as<br>
 they continued to lobby for shorter work hours and were seen as putting
their own interests ahead of the nation's.<br>
<br>
Many workers, as more of their demands for better working<br>
conditions and pay were met, joined less militant unions, and the<br>
idealistic IWW movement was largely dead by the mid-1930s.<br>
<br>
But those at the commemoration said the sacrifices of the<br>
impoverished, ballad-singing Wobblies at Everett shouldn't be forgotten.<br>
<br>
"The Everett Massacre was a free speech battle," Rieder said.<br>
"That was a basic U.S. right."<br>

THE EVERETT MASSACRE.<br>
<br>
Joan and Gene Olson, "The Wobblies and the Everett Massacre," <B>Washington Times and Trails.</B> Grants Pass: Windyridge Press, 1970, p. 243-255.<br>
<br>
In self defense, management stiffened its back, hired more Pinkerton strikebreakers and dug in.  Now the Wobblies and the bosses were on a collision course and neither showed the least disposition to turn aside.  Mass murder was inevitable.<br>
<br>
It came first in Everett, on the afternoon of Sunday, November 5, 19 16.  Under a bright sun, the Everett Massacre thundered into histofyBut the trouble did not come out of a clear sky; thefe was background.  The I.W.W. had stirred up trouble during a shingle mill strike at the Puget Sound town.  Authorities ran about 40 Wobs out of town, no big thing in itself, but they chose to force the men to run between two lines of huskies bearing pick handles on their way out; some Wobbly blood flowed.<br>
<br>
The Seattle I.W.W. cried out for revenge and announced angrily that it would sail to Everett en masse on the following Sunday and a picnic was not on the agenda.  On that day, almost 300 Wobblies boarded the steamers Verona and Calirta.  Bellowing songs from the Wobbly songbook, the men on the Verona were in high spirits as their ship left Seattle harbor ahead of the Calista and steamed toward Everett.  Some of them were sin-ainly their last songs . . .<br>
Police and vigilantes waited on the whaff at Everett, their mission plain: keep the Wobs from landing.<br>

Firing broke out; men screamed. (Police said the first gunshots came from the Verona,- the Wobs said they came from the wharf; the truth probably will never be known.) The water around the ship soon went red with the blood of the dead and wounded.<br>
<br>
When the firing stopped, the skipper of the Verona frantically backed his ship out of range, then turned and ran at full steam for Seattle, meeting the Calirta along the way.  Told of the Everett battle, the Calistds captain swung his craft and followed the Verona back to Seattle.<br>
<br>
Five Wobblies and two vigilantes had died in the brief outburst of murder.  Almost 60 men were'wounded. (The names of the Wobbly dead say something about the take-all-comers character of the organization:<br>
<br>
Felix Baran, a Frenchman; Hugo Gerlat, a German; Gustav Johnson, a<br>
Swede; John Looney, an Irishman; and Abraham Rabinowitz, a Russian<br>
Jew.)<br>
<br>
Seventy-four Wobblies were arrested off the ships at Seattle, despite the fact that police found no firearms on the ships, only clubs and packages of red pepper. (It would have been easy, of course-and wise-for the Wobblies to throw their guns into Puget Sound.)<br>
<br>
An important Washington Wobbly, Tom Tracy, was first to go on trial for the Everett Massacre.  During a two-month hearing, his lawyers argued that it was impossible to tell who had fired the first shot; they pointed out, too, that the two dead vigilantes might well have been shot by their own kind during the wild scramble on the pier.<br>
<br>
Tracy went free, as did the other 73 Wobbly defendants.  No one was ever tried for killing the five Wobblies.  The Everett Massacre, when all was said and done, was a publicity bonanza for the I.W.W. As was their habit, they milked it dry.<br>

EVERETT MASSACRE.<br>
<br>
Harvey O'Conner, "The Bloody Voyage of the Verona," <B>Revolution in Seattle.</B> New York: Monthly Review Press, 1964 p. 29-57.<br>
<br>
Thirty miles north of Seattle lies Everett, on a bay of Puget Sound.  When the Great Northern Railroad swooped down from the
Cascades in the 1890's and struck the sea first at Everett there were high hopes that this would become the Queen City but fate decreed it should aspire to no higher title than the City<br>
of Smokestacks.<br>
<br>
These were the stacks of the lumber mills; by night the sky was reddened with the glow of a score of sanvdust burners disposing of mill refuse.  The timber came from the slopes of the Cascades in Snohomish County by rail, and from the northern Puget Sound country in great booms of logs hauled by little tugs.  The cedar was mostly cut into squarish blocks and then turned into shingles the city's leading product.<br>
<br>
There was no premonition in 1915 that in this rather drab little city of some 30,000 people would develop one of the nation's most famous labor cases, that the crude brutality of its ruling class would fan the embers that would sweep across the Puget Sound country two years later in the first general strike in the lumber industry, in which loggers and sawmill workers alike would win the eight-hour day and elevation from the status of timber beast to that of lumber worker.<br>
<br>
As far back as 1901 the shingle weavers - the men who saw and pack shingles - had organized.  With varying luck in succeeding years they had tried to resist wage cuts or to get increases, all the while the ten-hour day hung around their necks like the albatross.<br>
<br>
Ranged against them were a score of mills run by tough-minded rugged individualists, some of them, like former Governor Clough of Minnesota, men who had come to Everett with some money, others who had risen from the ranks of workmen through superior cunning and aggressiveness, but all of them bound by no common tie but single-minded devotion to as low wages and as high prices as the market would afford.<br>
<br>
There was no other industry in the city and the mill owners, as in the cotton mill towns of Massachusetts and the mines of Pennsylvania, were the lords of their creation, attended by a small middle class dependent on their favors.  Certainly in few other cities in the Pacific Northwest were class lines drawn more sharply between owners and workers.<br>
<br>
Shingle-weaving is a craft demanding high skill and manual dexterity.  Sunset, the Atlantic Monthly of the Pacific Coast, gave a view into inferno: "The saw on his left sets the pace.  If the singing blade rips 50 rough shingles off the block every minute, the sawyer must reach over to its teeth 50 times in 60 seconds; if the automatic carriage feeds the odorous wood 60 times into the hungry teeth, 60 times he must reach over, turn<br>
the shingle, trim its edge on the gleaming saw in front of him,<br>
cut the narrow strip containing the knot hole with two quick
<br>
movements of his right hand and toss the completed board down the chute to the packers, meanwhile keeping eyes and ears open for the sound that asks him to feed a new block into the untiring teeth.<br>
<br>
Hour after hour the shingle weaver's hands and arms, plain, unarmored flesh and blood, are staked against the screeching steel that cares not what it severs.  Hour after hour the steel sings its crescendo note as it bites into the wood, the sawdust cloud thickens, the wet sponge under the sawyer's nose fills with fine particles.<br>
<br>
If 'cedar asthma,' the shingle weaver's occupational disease, does not get him, the steel will.  Sooner or later he reaches over a little too far, the whirling blade tosses drops of deep red into the air, and a finger, a hand or part of an arm comes sliding down the slick chute."<br>
<br>
You knew the shingle weaver on the street by his mutilated hands and the deadly gray pallor of his cheeks.<br>
<br>
In 1915 the shingle weavers struck against a wage cut, and as was customary in Everett, faced injunctions, gunmen, and strike-
breakers.  Hunger drove the men back to work, the mill owners<br>
promising somewhat vaguely to rescind the wage cut if and when the price of shingles went up.  With the hot breath of war stirring across the land in 1916, the price did go up, but not the pay.<br>
<br>
The union, which had strength in other sawmill towns, set May I as a strike date and most mills outside Everett and one in the city raised wages.  The strikes in the other mills dragged on through June and July, with hunger helping the owners to recruit strikebreakers.  On August 19 there were but 18 men on the picket line.<br>
<br>
They were frisked by police, who found no weapons, and forced to cross a narrow trestle 30 feet above the channel.  On the other side were 70 armed men.  With no avenue of escape, the men crossed over - to be beaten unmercifully.  The news spread through Everett and at nightfall the pickets, their numbers now swollen by fellow workers, returned to the jamisort mill to exact revenge.  This time the police, who had looked on nonchalantly at the morning's melee, charged with drawn revolvers.  The uneven contest continued, with more arrests and beatings.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile in Seattle an historic convocation of loggers had been called by the Industrial Workers of the World for July 4, during the annual holiday shutdown.  Although the I.W.W. could claim only 50 paid-up loggers at the time, some 500 men showed up from scores of camps.<br>
<br>
National headquarters in Chicago, asked for an organizer, sent out James Rowan.  His first assignment was to scout Everett.  
On July 31 he spoke at Wetmore and Hewitt Avenues, in downtown Everett, confining himself to an industrial unionist propaganda speech drawn largely from the famous report of the federal Industrial Relations Commission.  Sheriff Donald McRae observed the scene.  Walker C. Smith, who wrote the official I.W.W. book, The Everett Massacre, had frequent occasion to refer to the sheriff and always - except once - he added the laconic sentence: "McRae was drunk."<br>
<br>
Rowan was thrown into jail and given a "floater" the next morning - the choice between 30 days in jail or leaving town.  He left.  Another Wobbly organizer came to town, opened a union hall and arranged for James P. Thompson, the I.W.W.'s most prominent speaker in the Northwest, to lecture.  No large hall could be obtained so the meeting was scheduled for the downtown spot where the Salvation Army and various political speakers held forth.  When printed notices were posted, Sheriff McRae entered the I.W.W. hall, tore them down and ordered the organizer out of town.  "McRae was drunk."<br>
<br>
He went to a nearby poolhall, frisked the players and deported all those not residents.  The shingle weavers' picket line was also raided and several men deported.  "Not a man in overalls is safe!" said the secretary of the A.F. of L. Building Trades Council.<br>
<br>
Thompson and some 20 members of the I.W.W. came over from Seattle for the announced street meeting.  One by one the speakers were dragged from the platform and hustled off to jail.  While the crowd sang "The Red Flag," the arrests continued.  More than a thousand marched to the jail to protest.  Obviously they weren't all Wobblies.<br>
<br>
The socialist movement had struck roots in Everett around<br>
1900; by 1911 the Commonwealth had been established and this<br>
persevered under various titles until 1917.  One of its editors was Maynard Shipley, who had been editor of the Oakland World, a socialist weekly, in 1908.<br>
<br>
A young man in Stockton helped Shipley with the platform and literature, just for a chance to get some training in public speaking.  His name was Tom Mooney.  Shipley began editing the Commonwealth in 1913 and also, for a time, the Everett A.F. of L. weekly at a time when a majority of delegates in the Everett Central Labor Council carried Socialist Party cards.<br>
<br>
After campaigning for the U.S. Senate in 1916, Shipley went east to help Debs with his campaign for Congress.  Later he became famous as a lecturer and founder of the Science League of America, which battled on the issue of teaching evolution in the schools.<br>
<br>
In 1916, H. W. Watts, editor of the renamed Northwest Worker, carried on in the Shipley tradition and protested at the jail
doors, and was tossed into a cell for his trouble.<br>
<br>
The morning after the arrests the Wobblies were deported, some by the interurban trolley that ran to Seattle, and others by the boat that made regular daily runs between the two ports.<br>
<br>
The deportees conferred with their fellow workers in Seattle in the big second-floor hall on Washington Street, the center of the skid road.  Chicago headquarters and Solidarity, the national I.W.W. paper, were alerted.  The Free Speech Battle in Everett was on!<br>
<br>
The I.W.W. thrived on repression.  Their answer to bans on public meetings and to arrests was to send out a call to the "foot-loose rebels" to mobilize.  The cry would be heard in "jungles" all through the West where migratory workers gathered after a hard day's ride "on the rods" underneath freight cars or in more sumptuous quarters in box cars and gondolas.<br>
<br>
There in the jungle near the railroad tracks they cooked an evening mulligan of meat and vegetables in stray cans and dis-
cussed conditions of their lives - the class struggle, which in its rudimentary form meant to them the prospects of finding a job, of getting better pay and cutting down the hours, and of dealing with the arm of law and order which was always around the corner eager to jail or deport them.<br>
<br>
The cry would also be heard in all the ramshackle Wobbly halls - usually store fronts in the dilapidated part of town near the railroad tracks but nevertheless, often boasting a battered piano and shelves filled with books and newspapers.  There the "bindlestiff " - the workingman with all his possessions rolled up inside a tattered blanket, known as a bindle - could find a free flop in a corner on the floor, if he were broke.<br>
<br>
A big can of coffee was steaming on the stove, alongside a five-pound lard can of mulligan stew for the men en route to and from harvest fields, construction and logging camps, and the "Slave market" - the sorry streets such as Madison in Chicago and Washington in Seattle where "job sharks," the employment agencies, specialized in the sale of migratory labor.<br>
<br>
In the jungles and halls, workers scanned the columns of Solidarity and of the Industrial Worker, organ of western branches of the I.W.W. The Industrial Worker, formerly published in Spokane, had shifted to Seattle April 1, 1916.  In its columns appeared the cry for footloose rebels to rally to Everett.<br>
<br>

It was in 1909 that the Wobblies made their debut as "militant jail and soapbox belligerents in the free-speech fight," as Paul F. Brissenden, chronicler of the early I.W.W., put it.  In the fall of 1909 free-speech fights erupted in Missoula, Montana, center of a wide logging and construction area, in New Castle, Pennsylvania, the sheet-steel center, and in Spokane.<br>
<br>
Some 20 such battles broke out between 1909 and 1913, including the famous conflict in San Diego, unparalleled up to that time for the brutality inflicted by the authorities.<br>
<br>
An editorial in the San Diego Tribune reflected the intensity of the feeling aroused: "Hanging is none too good for them [the I.W.W.]; they would be much better dead, for they are absolutely useless in the human economy; they are the waste material of creation and should be drained off into the sewer of oblivion there to rot in cold obstruction like any other excrement."<br>
<br>
The classic free-speech battle of the I.W.W. was fought in Spokane in the fall and winter of 1909.  There the job shark situation was particularly atrocious in the winter of 1908-1909.<br>
<br>
It was customary for the employment agencies, in collusion with<br>
the head boss on the job, to promote a rapid turnover - "one crew coming, one working, and one going." The more rapid the turnover the more fees for the job shark, to be split with the boss.  Times were hard and always there was a score of men for every job; if the job-seeker had no money, the fee was deducted from his pay.<br>
<br>
The I.W.W. had been campaigning for direct hiring and abolition of fees, but in the wretched condition of the slave market it could make no headway.  In Spokane alone there were 31 sharks doing a thriving business in human flesh and blood.<br>
<br>
The Spokane Spokesman-Review reported January 18, 1909, that a crowd of two to three thousand idle men had hurled rocks and chunks of ice through the windows of one agency and were about to wreck it when the I.W.W. organizer, James H. Walsh, mounted a chair and "stemmed the rising tide of riot and pacified the multitude."<br>
<br>
In the opinion of the police, if it had not been for the intervention of Walsh, "a riot would surely have followed." Walsh led the men to the I.W.W. hall and warned them that "Pinkertons" - private industrial detectives -in the crowd were trying to provoke trouble so "they would have some excuse for shooting you down or smashing your heads in."<br>
<br>
During the Summer of 1909 the job sharks retaliated against the I.W.W. by having the city council outlaw street meetings, except for the Salvation Army.  After protesting in vain to the council against the unconstitutionality of the ordinance, the Industrial Worker on October 28 sent out a call: "Wanted Men to Fill the
jails of Spokane."<br>
<br>
On November 2, appointed as Free Speech Day, the council had a rock pile ready while the Wobblies had hundreds of volunteers who had answered the call.  On that day 103 men were arrested as fast as the police could drag them from the soapbox.  The story is told of one young Wobbly who had never before spoken in public and became tongue-tied on the soapbox.<br>
<br>
Finally he blurted out, in desperation, "Where are the cops?" The cops, who had been busy elsewhere, obliged him by pulling him off his box.  By the <B>end</B> of November 500 Wobblies were in jail, consigned to bread and water when they refused to work on the rock pile.<br>
<br>
The jail filled to bursting and then a school was used for the overflow, and when this filled up the Army obligingly placed an empty barracks at the city's command.  Eight men in turn edited the Industrial Worker, as previous editors went to jail.  Elizabeth Gurley Flynn chained herself to a lamppost, as the suffragists were doing in London.<br>
<br>
The arrival of Gurley Flynn, preeminent woman speaker in an organization necessarily almost entirely male in membership, sparked the fight.  Stewart Holbrook in Holy Old Mackinaw describes her as "young, handsome - with a western hat turned up in front, and a flaming red tie around her pretty throat - and she was a hellion that breathed reddish flame; fairly sober reporters affirmed that a flash from the girl's blue-gray eyes would serve to light a Sweet Caporal.<br>
<br>
The Flynn promptly entered the fight." From jail Miss Flynn broadcast the information that the police were using the women's section as a brothel and were soliciting customers for it.<br>
<br>
The Industrial Worher was obliged to move to Seattle to be out of the reach of the Spokane police.  William Z. Foster, who had gone to Spokane to report for the Seattle Workingman's Paper, joined the I.W.W. and served his brief time as an editor of the Industrial Worker before being thrown into jail.<br>
<br>
During the winter the national spotlight swung to Spokane as correspondents flocked to the city to witness this most dramatic of challenges for observance of the First Amendment.  They saw men marched to court matted with blood from the beatings administered in jail, but one and all they refused to flinch.<br>
<br>
On their weekly march to public baths they were showered with sacks of Bull Durham tobacco and fruit by friendly citizens.  On March 4 victory came when Spokane freed all the prisoners and quit enforcing the ban on free speech.  The licenses of 19 of the more offensive job sharks were revoked and the practice of direct
hiring grew.<br>
<br>
From this great battle the I.W.W. emerged with reputation<br>
enhanced, and its fame spread far and wide. City authorities were loath to enter into conflict with an army of workingmen whose<br>
ranks swelled with persecution and whose jail expenses threatened to bankrupt the treasuries of cities even as large as Spokane.<br>
<br>
Roger Baldwin, a connoisseur of techniques in the battle for freedom, recalls that his first contact with the I.W.W. was during their free-speech fight in Kansas City in 1912.  Their technique, he said, was "to demonstrate the powerlessness of all the forces of law and order in the face of men determined to fill the jails if necessary to win the right to talk.<br>
<br>
"No power on earth can beat men with the courage to go to jail, willingly and cheerfully, for a principle, and if there are enough of them." In no case, he recounts, did the I.W.W. engage in violence, but "the violence used against them was colossal." He estimated that they lost ten men killed and 2,000 jailed in the free-speech fights.  It was this unending battle, Baldwin concluded, that built the personality of the I.W.W. as "the unrivalled spokesman of native American militancy."<br>
<br>
So when the I.W.W. decided to test the issue of free speech in Everett, they brought with them impressive experience.<br>
<br>
Cheerfully, rather carelessly, but in dead earnest they entered a conflict which they knew would run the gamut of lawlessness by official law and order.  An old-time police officer, writing years later in a Seattle police magazine, gave some flavor of those times:<br>
<br>
The Wobblies agitated incessantly, provoked occasional acts of sabotage.  This drove the lumber magnates to the point of despera-
tion and to eventual violence.  It is not easy to understand today just how thoroughly these "lords of creation" controlled the whole lifeblood of the state.  They made governors and broke them, and the whole administration of justice was in some way influenced by them.<br>
<br>
"Violence was no stranger to them and on more than one occasion they have broken strikes through the organization of "Vigilantes" and "Special Deputies."<br>
<br>
Of Everett he wrote:<br>
<br>
The infiltration of a number of I.W.W. organizers into the area and the resulting agitation in favor of the strikers which they created drove the timbermen into speechless rage.  David M.
Clough, a former governor of Minnesota, and spokesman for the lumber inter<B>ests sa</B>id:<br>
<br>
"We propose to clean Everett of all members of the I.W.W. and to forcibly prevent the incursion of any more of their ilk."<br>
<br>
The Wobblies came, first singly, then in teams, and then by the score.  After the Thompson meeting had been broken up, an organizer came to town and reopened the hall.  Sheriff McRae stormed in: "You God-damned son of a bitch, are you back here again? Get on your coat and get into that autol"<br>
<br>
The organizer was deported.  Herbert Mahler, Seattle I.W.W. secretary, came over to see the mayor.  McRae immediately deported him.  Several I.W.W.'s returned a few days later and reopened the hall; for a time there was no interference.  A rather odd thing happened one night: one of the I.W.W. speakers began to advocate the use of violence.  He was pulled from the platform by his own fellow workers.  His name was George Reese, of whom more was to be heard.<br>
<br>
During this lull in the battle, caused by the presence in the city of a federal labor official trying to mediate the shingle weavers' strike, Secretary Mahler tried to intercede ivith Governor Ernest Lister and Mayor D. D. Merrill of Everett, but he got no response to his appeal for law and order.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, the Commercial Club and Sheriff McRae laid their plans to take over the city.  On August 30 the leading mill owners and their retainers met in the morning at the Commercial Club to prepare strategy, and that night a public meeting was held there.<br>
<br>
To a suggestion that it might be well to call in the federal mediator, former Governor Clough retorted that there was nothing to be mediated.  The meeting then got down to business.  By-passing the chief of police, Clough asked Sheriff McRae if he could handle the situation.  McRae said he did not have enough deputies.<br>
<br>
"Swear in the members of the Commercial Club, then," said Clough.  Some 200 volunteered.  McRae swore in a few and then, as Walker Smith remarks, he found swearing, for the first time in his life, a little tedious, and he turned the job over to the secretary of the Commercial Club.  The deputies were divided into special squads, one to watch incoming trains, another the boats, and others for beating up and deporting Wobblies.  There were to be no mass jailings in Everett, a la Spokane. Deportation was the weapon.<br>
<br>
These developments tore Everett in two.  Many merchants resigned from the Commercial Club and posted notices in their windows: "We Are Not Members of the Commercial Club." The boycott committee
took care of such recalcitrants, and also those merchants who advertised in the socialist weekly, the Northwest Worker.<br>
<br>
As it turned out later, on sworn evidence, there was also a finance committee which paid for the accumulation of an arsenal - blackjacks, leaded clubs, guns, and ammunition - and for the employment of special operatives.  When citizens complained to the chief of police about such activities, that worthy shrugged his shoulders and said that the sheriff and his "drunken deputies" had taken over law enforcement within the city.<br>
<br>
Then came the heat lightning before the storm.  The federal mediator, hopeless in his mission, had left town.  On September 7 several speakers were thrown in jail; the following night, more.  An I.W.W. member sent to engaae an attorney was beaten up<br>
and deported.<br>
<br>
As trains and boats entering the city were being searched, the I.W.W. thought to circumvent the blockade by hiring a small boat at Mukilteo, a little sawmill town several miles south of Everett.<br>
<br>
The "Wanderer" could take only a dozen or so, and six men were towed behind in a dory.  As the boat approached the harbor, the tug "Edison," known as the scab tug" because there was a strike of tugboatmen and longshoremen at the time, came out from shore with Sheriff McRae and about 60 deputies.<br>
<br>
At 200 feet, the sheriff began shooting.  Captain Jack Mitten, a respected citizen of Mukilteo, shut down his engine and the "Edison" drew near.  "You son of a bitch, you come over here," shouted McRae.  "If you want me, you come over here," shouted back Mitten.  The deputies boarded the "Wanderer" and ordered the Wobblies on to the tugboat.<br>
<br>
As Captain Mitten bent over to make fast a stern line, McRae hit him with the butt of his revolver and when Mitten remonstrated, hit him again, and then slugged him in the groin, causing a rupture.  McRae then went after other men he recognized.  At the dock they were herded into patrol wagons and carted off to jail - 21 in all, including the skipper and engineer of the "Wanderer."<br>
<br>
There many were beaten.  After nine days without charges being preferred, they were offered liberty, except Captain Mitten.  The 20 refused to leave the jail without him and so, reluctantly, the captain was released too.<br>
<br>
During this time Organizer Rowan came to town, was greeted by three deputies at the train, and taken to jail.  Later McRae came around.  McRae was drunk.  "We are going to start you off on the road to Seattle," he told Rowan.  Several miles out of town near
the interurban tracks he was released and told "to beat it." But some 50 yards on a group of deputies awaited him, their faces hidden by handkerchiefs.<br>
<br>
They threw a cloth over Rowan's head and proceeded to beat him unmercifully with gun butts.  He was then put across a fallen tree and beaten across the back some 50 times or more with a sap - a leather thong loaded with lead at the end.<br>
<br>
It would be repetitive to continue the tales of cruelty suffered<br>
by the I.W.W.'s as they continued to come in to Everett.  By this time the deputies were beating up Everett citizens as well, some of them bystanders at Wetmore and Hewitt where the Wobblies doggedly continued to mount the box while the deputies pulled them down, jailed them for the night, and then deported them.<br>
<br>
Armed gangs of deputies roamed the environs, rounding up Wobblies coming from the harvest and bound for Seattle.  "Sergeant" John J. Keenan, 65, related the story of his fellow workers.  He had been working on a threshing crew near Great Falls, Montana, and after the harvest was in, joined up with a group of migratories coming from the Dakota fields.<br>
<br>
The Sergeant was bound for Seattle.  "I winter in Seattle every year," he explained, "and work on the snow sheds." These were the sheds up in the mountain passes where the railroads come<br>
through the Cascades.<br>
<br>
Many migratory workers "wintered" in Seattle.  Some followed the crops up from California into the mountain states <B>and then</B> headed west for the milder climate of the Coast.  The better-heeled might settle in one of the working-class hotels near the skid road run by enterprising Japanese.<br>
<br>
These hotels were reasonably clean and, although cell-like in their rooms, had large lobbies where guests could relax.  But along Washington, Occidental, First and Second Avenues South, and other streets of the skid road there were flophouses where a "room" could be had for prices ranging from a dime to two bits.<br>
<br>
These were in old office buildings south of Yesler Way, long since abandoned for business as the center of town turned northward.  The lofts were partitioned off into cells, large enough for a cot and some hooks for clothing.  In the corridors dim yellow bulbs glimmered in the gloom, but denizens took candles to their cells.<br>
<br>
The partitions ran up six or seven feet and were surmounted by wire netting to the ceiling, to afford privacy and ventilation.  The mattresses usually were filthy - bedbugs ran rampant and along the sides crawled vermin of many hues.  But to the migratory this was a fact of life, to be met with in bunkhouses in logging and
construction camps everywhere, and to be tolerated as one of those penalties fate inflicted on migratory workers.<br>
<br>
Chinese restaurants supplied migratories with breakfast for a dime - a "stack of wheats" and coffee.  Dinner was 25 cents stew or beans with potatoes.  The more affluent among the migratories, early in the winter, might splurge by going to Chauncey Wright's, located right off the skid road, where a dollar bought a good meal - a well-done Western style steak, or a juicy ham steak flanked by fried eggs.  But to continue with the Sergeant's story:<br>
<br>
We arrived in Snohomish [near Everett] on September 23 in the moming.  I sent the food committee out with some money and they brought back $4.90 worth of food, including two frying pans, and when I was about cooking, a little boy, who was maybe about ten, he says, "Dad, are you an I.W.W.?" 1 says, "I am, son." "Well," he says, "there are a whole bunch of deputies coming out after you."<br>
<br>
I laughed at the boy, I thought he was joshing me.<br>
<br>
About half an hour after the boy told me this the deputies ap-
peared.  In the first bunch were 42, and then Sheriff Mckae came <B>with</B> more, making altogether, what I counted, 64.  In the first bunch was a fat, stout fellow with two guns.  He had a chief's badge on him.  He was facing toward the fire and he says, "If you move a step, I will fill you full of lead!"<br>
<br>
I laughed at him; says I, "What does this outrage mean?" There was another old gentleman with a chin beard, fat, middling fat, probably my own age, and he picked up my coat which was lying alongside me and looked at my button [the red-and-gold three-star I.W.W. button].<br>
<br>
He says, "Oh, undesirable citizen!" I says, "What do you mean?" He says, "Are you an I.W.W?" I says, "I am, and 1 am more than proud of it!" "Well," he says we don't want you in this county." I says, "Well, I am not going to stay in this county, I am going to cook breakfast and go to Seattle."<br>
<br>
He says, "Do you know what this means?" I says, "No." He says, "The sheriff will be here in a few minutes and he will tell you what it means." I heard afterward that this Man was the mayor of Snohomish.<br>
<br>
I was sitting right opposite the fire with my coffee and bread and meat in my hand when Sheriff McRae came up and says, "Who is this bunch?" So a tall, dark-complected deputy says, "They are a bunch of harvest hands coming from North Dakota." McRae says, "Did you search these men?"<br>
<br>
And he says, "Yes, they had no shooting arms on them."<br>

<br>
McRae  then  went  over  to  the  Sergeant,   cursing   and   ordering him and his fellow workers to walk down the railroad track toward Seattle.  They kept walking until late afternoon when the Sergeant's feet gave way and they rested at a railroad station to make coffee and wait for the evening freight into Seattle.<br>
<br>
After the freight pulled in, four autos came along the road, throwing their searchlights along the tracks.<br>
<br>
I says, "Men, we have run up against a stone wall.  Fellow-Worker Love and I -he came off the machine with me in Great Falls we were first in line and Sheriff McRae and two other men with white handkerchiefs around their necks came forward first and he says,<br>
<br>
"You son of a bitch, I thought you were going to Seattle?" I says, "Ain't I going to Seattle? I can't go till the train goes." I says, .'you've had me walking now till I have no foot under me.<br>
What do you mean by this outrage? My father fought for this country and I have a right here.  I am on railroad property and have done nothing to anybody."<br>
<br>
McRae then hit Fellow-Worker Love on the head and I yelled, "Break and run, men, or they will kill youl" He turned around then and he said to me, "You dirty old Irish bastard, now I will make you so you can't run.  I'll show youl" With that he let drive and hit me, leaving this three-cornered mark here [indicating glace on head].  And when the others went up the track he <B>says</B>, "Get now, God damn your old soul, or I will kill you!"<br>
<br>
After wandering down the track in the dark  the Wobblies lay down to sleep in the bushes.  When the morning freight came along, they boarded it.  The trainman looked over at the Sergeant.  "Do you carry a card?" he asked.<br>
<br>
"Yes," said the Sergeant.  "Produce!" he said.  That was the trainman's way of asking to see a man's Wobbly card, a credential to ride free.  "You better get back in the caboose, you are hurt," said the trainman, but the Sergeant answered that "where the men are riding is good enough for me." Eventually they got into Seattle and made a report to the Seattle branches.<br>
<br>
During October more than 300 men were deported from Everett.  By the end of the month it was obvious that a more concerted effort must be made; the deputies were able to pick off the men who came in small groups.  So 41 men, most of them freshly in from the harvest fields, volunteered to go by boat to Everett.  Waiting for them at the dock Sheriff McRae ("McRae was drunk") had mobilized some 200 deputies wearing white handkerchiefs around their necks.  They herded the Wobblies into trucks and autos.<br>
<br>
Those not quick enough were beaten with gun butts and saps.  The cortege led out of town to a place called Beverly Park where the road crossed the interurban tracks.  There the deputies formed two
lines across the tracks and the I.W.W.'s were forced to run the gauntlet.<br>
<br>
From behind and in front they were slugged by waiting deputies in the cold, rainy night, illuminated by auto lights-until they reached the cattleguard on the railroad tracks which was armed with sharp spikes.  Here the men, many of them stunned and bleeding, stumbled into the mantrap and fell, painfully lacerating their feet and legs while the deputies swung hard and fast.  So great was the outcry that people in a house a quarter mile away came running.<br>
<br>
C.      H. Rice, a harvest worker whose shoulder had been dislocated by the deputies, related:<br>
<br>
Then the fellow who was on the dock, and had been drinking pretty heavily, because they would have to shove him back every <B>once</B> in a while, he shouted out, "Let's burn him!"<br>
<br>
About that time Sheriff McRae came over and got hold of my throat and said, "Now, danm you, I will tell you 1 can kill you right here and there never would be nothing known about it, and you know it." And some one said, "Let's hang himl" and this other fellow kept hollering, "Burn himl Burn himl" McRae kept hitting me, first on one side and then the other, smacking me the way, and then he turned me loose again and hit me with one of those slingshots, and finally he said, "Oh, let him go," and he started me along, following behind and hitting me until I got over the cattleguard.<br>
<br>
"I went down to the interurban track until I caught up with some of the boys.  They tried to pull my shoulder back into place and then they took handkerchiefs and neckties, and one thing and another, and made a kind of sling to hold it up.  We then went dowrl to the first station and the boys took up a collection and the eight of us who were hurt the worst got on the train and went to Seattle.  The others had to walk the 25 miles into Seattle.  Most of us had to go to the hospital next day."<br>
<br>
The next morning a delegation of Everett and Seattle clergymen, union leaders, and others examined the ground at Beverly Park.  President E. P. Marsh of the State Federation of Labor reported that "the tale of that struggle was plainly written.  The roadway was stained with blood.  The blades of the cattleguard were so stained....<br>
<br>
Early that morning workmen going into the city to work picked up three hats from the ground, still damp with blood.  There can be no excuse for nor extenuation of such an inhuman method of punishment." The Beverly Park outrage was Everett's main theme of discussion the next day, and by nightfall it had been decided that there should be a mass meeting the following Sunday, November 5, at Hewitt and Wetmore in the center of town.  
The Reverend McGill of Seattle, who had taken the lead in marshaling support, consulted with Secretary Mahler of the I.W.W., who agreed to plans for the meeting.  The newspapers were informed.  The announcement was a signal for the Commercial Club to prepare for battle.  Blackjacks and clubs were laid aside for a growing arsenal of revolvers and rifles, and additional deputies were sworn in.<br>
<br>
Sheriff McRae dropped into the little Wobbly hall on November 3. Looking around, he announced that "I won't have a lot of sons of bitches hanging around this place like in Seattle." The secretary remarked that there was a constitution.<br>
<br>
"To hell with the Constitution," broke in McRae.  "We have a constitution here that we will enforce." The next day he raided the hall and seized all except the secretary.  Turning to that man, he said: "I'll bet you a hundred dollars you bastards won't hold that meeting tomorrow!" McRae was drunk.<br>
<br>
The men were frisked for weapons, but none had been found on an I.W.W. member during the whole period; then the men were deported.  That Saturday night there was a mobilization of deputies at the Commercial Club - a kind of pep rally.  The blowing of the mill whistles Sunday would be the signal to meet at the dock where the Seattle boat comes in.<br>
<br>
For Sunday, November 5, the I.W.W. chartered the "Verona," a vessel in the "mosquito fleet" that plied the waters of Puget Sound.  Four by four, the Wobblies marched from their hall down to the Colman Dock in Seattle where steamers left for various ports of the Sound.  The captain tallied them off as they boarded, and stopped them when the number reached 250, his legal safety limit.  Among them were a few regular passengers.<br>
<br>
Other passengers for Everett were told to take the "Calista," and 38 I.W.W.'s who could not get on the "Verona" boarded the other vessel.  Most of the men were harvest workers but among them also were lumber workers, hard-rock miners, and other migratories.  On this sparkling sun-lit day it seemed more like a holiday excursion as the lines were cast off and the "Verona" backed out into the waters of Elliott Bay.<br>
<br>
As the vessel headed northward, the Wobblies began singing the songs that had marked their rendezvous in many a hall, jungle, and street corner meeting, the words of which were contained in the Little Red Songbook, of which more copies have been printed across the century than of any other single collection.  As the boat swung up to the City Dock in Everett the I.W.W.'s were singing the English transport workers' song:<br>

We meet today in Freedom's cause,<br>
And raise our voices high;<br>
We'll join our hands in union strong,<br>
To battle or to die.<br>
<br>
Hold the fort for we are coming,<br>
Union men be strong.<br>
Side by side we battle onward,<br>
Victory will come!<br>
<br>
But the dock was strangely empty.  Usually there was a crowd there, waiting to greet those coming, or to board the vessel.  On this Sunday afternoon there were only a few men on the dock; the mill whistles had blown at one, and a rope had been placed along the end of the dock to hold back the Sunday crowd.<br>
<br>
On the hill behind the dock were thousands of Everett citizens waiting to greet the men on the "Verona" and to march with them to the meeting place.  Young Hugo Gerlot climbed the flagstaff on the bow of the "Verona," waving greetings while singing "Hold the Fort." Men poured out of the cabin as a line went over to tie the bow of the vessel to the dock. just then one Of the three men on the dock, Sheriff McRae, hitched his holster <B>to </B>bring his gun directly across his middle.  Then he raised his hand and hailed the boat:<br>
"Who is your leader?"<br>
<br>
Back came the usual Wobbly reply:<br>
<br>
"We're all leaders ! "<br>
<br>
"You can't land here !"<br>
<br>
"The hell we can'tl" came the response from the ship as the men headed toward the gangplank which was being placed in position.<br>
Then a shot rang out, folloived by a volley.  Hugo Gerlot's body slumped, then toppled to the deck.  Shot through the head, both arms, hip, and leg, he tried to raise himself to continue the song.  The volleys continued and there was a rush to gain the other side of the vessel to escape the hail of lead.<br>
<br>
The "Verona" listed sharply to starboard, submerging her lower deck, and many crashed through the railing into the cold waters of the bay.  Already the deck was slippery with blood as the murderous enfilade poured from the dock, from the warehouse behind which some 200 deputies were hidden, from the opposite dock, and from the tug "Edison." Some of the Wobblies returned the fire but most of them were unarmed and quite helpless.<br>
<br>
The captain was hiding in the cabin behind a hasty barricade; one of the IWWs realizing that the entire body of men might be<br>
massacred, ran down to the engine room, dragged the frightened engineer from his hiding place and forced him to start the engine. 
<br>
The "Verona" lurched at her lone bowline; it snapped and after ten murderous minutes at the dock, the vessel began backing erratically until the engineer got control of the rudder lines.  The volleys from the dock continued until the "Verona" was out of range; the men struggling in the water then became the targets for the sharpshooters until they, too, disappeared.<br>
<br>
The captain resumed command of the boat and approached the "Calista" to warn her back, while those Wobblies unscathed by the fire began caring for the wounded.  Four men were beyond help; another died later.  Shirts and ties were torn up to make bandages and slings for the 31 wounded men.  Six more, it is believed, were drowned after being shot in the water.  At any rate there were six unclaimed Wobbly cards at headquarters for men who had left on the "Verona," bringing the death roll up to 11. Back on City Dock two deputies lay dead<br>
<br>
C. 0. Curtis, office manager of a lumber company, and Jefferson Beard, a deputy who had taken part in the Beverly Park outrage.  Sixteen of the deputies were wounded.  Most of them, it was proved later, were shot down in the crossfire between the docks and the "Edison." To the hoots and catcalls of the thousands on the hillside, the deputies dispersed.  An account of the feeling of the crowd was given in the Seattle Union Record, the A.F. of L. weekly edited by Harry Ault:<br>
<br>
"Your correspondent was on the street at the time of the battle and at the dock ten minutes afterward.  He mingled with the street crowds for hours afterward.  The temper of the people is dangerous.  Nothing but curses and execrations for the Commercial Club was heard.<br>
<br>
"Men and women who are ordinarily law abiding, who in normal times mind their own business pretty well, pay their taxes, sending their children to church and school, pay their bills, in every way comport themselves as normal citizens, were heard using the most vitriolic language concerning the Commercial Club, loudly sympathizing with the I.W.W.'s. And therein lies the great harm that was done, more menacing to the city than the presence of any number of I.W.W.'s, viz., the transformation of decent, honest citi<B><B>zens </B></B>into beings mad for vengeance and praying for something dire to happen.<br>
<br>
"I heard gray-haired women, mothers and wives, gentle, kindly, I know, in their home circles, openly hoping that the I.W.W.'s would come back and "clean up."<br>
<br>
President Marsh of the State Federation of Labor, himself an Everett citizen, added his words:<br>
<br>
A dangerous situation existed in Everett after the battle of No
-
vember 5. Public feeling ran high and anything might have happened.  Half a thousand citizens were under arms enraged at the Industrial Workers of the World and deadly determined to stamp out their organization in Everett.  It is no exaggeration to say that literally thousands of the working people of Everett were just as enraged toward members of the Commercial Club who participated in the gun battle.<br>
<br>
As the "Verona" edged into Colman Dock, police and hospital ambulances were waiting.  All the uninjured were marched to the city jail and the Wobblies on the "Calista" to the county jail.  To the morgue went the bodies of Hugo Gerlot, Gustav Johnson, John Looney, and Abraham Rabinowitz, and, within a few days, that of Felix Baran.<br>
<br>
In Seattle a fierce controversy was started by the Times and<br>
the Post-Intelligencer which charged that Mayor Hiram Gill was responsible for permitting the departure of the Wobblies on the "Verona." Mayor Gill stood by his guns.  "In the final analysis," he said, "it will be found that these cowards in Everett, who, without right or justification, shot into the crowd on the boat were the murderers and not the I.W.W.'s. The men who met the I.W.W.'s at the boat were a bunch of cowards.<br>
<br>
"They outnumbered the I.W.W.'s five to one, and in spite of this they stood there on the dock and fired into the boat, I.W.W.'s, innocent passengers, and all.  McRae and his deputies had no legal right to tell the I.W.W.'s or anyone else that they could not land there.  When the sheriff put his hand on the butt of his gun and told them they could not land, he fired the first shot, in the eyes of the law, and the I.W.W.'s can claim that they shot in self-
defense.... If I were one of the party of 40 I.W.W.'s who was almost beaten to death by 300 citizens of Everett [at the Beverly Park outrage] without being able to defend myself, I probably would have armed myself if I intended to visit Everett again."<br>
<br>
The mayor bought tobacco to be distributed among the prisoners and ordered them supplied with blankets.  The Chamber of Commerce thereupon tried to institute a recall campaign, but it fell flat.<br>
In the city jail, some 240 men were led, one by one, past a darkened cell in which were hidden two Pinkertons who had been on the "Verona." From time to time two fingers would be pushed forward from the cell to indicate that the man who had just passed should be held.<br>
<br>
One of the Pinkertons was George Reese, the same who had been pulled from the platform at the Everett I.W.W. street meeting when he began advocating violence.  It was he, too, in the Seattle longshoremen's strike, who urged the beating up of strikebreakers, who boasted that after assaulting these men he also robbed them, who was active mysteriously before many dock fires, and who had asked I.W.W. members for help in buying various chemicals.<br>

Seventy-four men were held and charged with the murder of the two deputies.  Most of them were native-born; four were born in Sweden, three each in Canada and Ireland, and six others in various other countries.  Their average age was 32 - a fair cross-section of the youthful membership of the I.W.W. None of the deputies, of course, was charged with the murder of the workers.<br>
<br>
Heavily handcuffed, the Wobblies were transferred to the Everett jail while I.W.W. headquarters in Chicago scoured the country for legal defense.  The choice fell, after Frank P. Walsh, former chairman of the Industrial Relations Commission, and others had declined, on Fred H. Moore of Los Angeles, who had defended the Wobblies in the great freespeech fight in Spokane in 1909-1910 and later the San Diego free-speech fighters, and then had served as counsel for Joe Ettor and Arturo Giovannitti, framed on a murder charge in the I.W.W. textile strike in Lawrence, Massachusetts, in 1912.<br>
<br>
The Seattle Central Labor Council, declaring that the I.W.W. free-speec@ fight in Everett had developed while assisting an A.F. of L. shingle weavers' strike, appointed an Everett defense committee consisting of Secretary James A. Duncan, C. W. Doyle, and Harry Ault, who proceeded to bail out the men of the "Calista," held on a weird "unlawful assembly" charge.<br>
<br>
They also helped the Seattle I.W.W. in persuading George F. Vanderveer, former county prosecuting attorney and a leading criminal lawyer, to assist Moore in the defense of the "Verona" defendants.  Hard-hitting, resourceful, and aggressive, and thor-
oughly familiar with people and affairs in the Puget Sound country, Vanderveer had never before appeared as counsel in a labor case.<br>
<br>
Having fought his way up in the pioneer, rough-andtumble jungle of Seattle law, he felt a contempt, barely concealed, for the Seattle upperworld- He knew only too well, having defended them, how they had accumulated their piles.  He had declined to attach himself to a lucrative corporation retainer, in order to keep his independence.  Intuitively, and not from any ideological persuasion, he felt far more at home with the underdogs of society whom he understood very well.<br>
<br>
A hard drinker and something of a pugilist, he had often found diversion after a hard-fought case by going down to the skid road and challenging the soapbox orators.  In the free-for-all that some-
times followed, he often retired bruised and elated.  <B>It </B>was this man who came to be called "counsel for the damned," and perhaps, after Clarence Darrow, he was the most famous legal defender of the downtrodden in his time.<br>
<br>
Characteristically, after taking the case, Vanderveer went to Everett where he surveyed minutely the City Dock, measuring its angles, sketching the scene, and talking endlessly with townspeople.<br>

On November 18 the bodies of Baran, Gerlot, and Looney were borne to Mount Pleasant cemetery in Seattle, with thousands marching in the cortege to the strains of "The Red Flag" and the "Marseillaise." A chorus of 100 from singing societies sang "Workers of the World, Awaken" by the graveside where Charles Ashleigh, the young English poet who was handling publicity for the I.W.W., delivered the funeral oration.<br>
<br>
The caskets were lowered as the throng sang "Hold The Fort" and then showers of red roses and carnations filled the graves.  The<br>
next afternoon 5,000 met at Dreamland Rink where IWW<br>
and A.F. of L. spokesmen, clergy, and public officials joined in commemoration of the dead and excoriation of the barbarism in Everett.<br>
<br>
They demanded that President Wilson investigate the massacre and the events leading up to it.  The appeal was ignored.<br>
<br>
At Everett the 74 indicted men were held incommunicado for two months, denied any reading materials, and subjected to the mercies of Sheriff McRae and his deputies.  Revolted by the vile food, the prisoners went on a hunger strike, and won.  Denied blankets and mattresses and forced to sleep on the cold steel floor in the chill November nights, the prisoners "built a battleship." With buckets and tins and such bits of metal as could be wrenched loose, they beat upon the walls, ceilings, and floors of the steel "tanks."<br>
<br>
Others linked themselves arm in arm and jumped in unison, shaking the walls of the jail.  All the while they shouted at the top of their lungs.  So great was the din that townspeople gathered around the jail, thinking that the deputies perhaps were murdering the inmates.  The prisoners won their blankets.<br>
<br>
On Thanksgiving Day a committee of Everett people, helped by members of the Cooks and Waiters Union, cooked a special dinner for the prisoners; Sheriff McRae turned them axvay and ordered a holiday feast of mush.  At one time a different type of "battleship" was built to protest the bad food.  The cell doors were pulled open by blankets tied to them.<br>
<br>
With small pieces of pipe the mechanism of the locking system above the doors was broken and then the entire system of locks demolished.  Outside their cells the men had access to some 300 pounds of corned beef that had been piled in a corner.  When the new sheriff arrived - McRae had gone out of office at the end of the year -he found the 74 men enjoying their first square meal in months.  It <B>cost </B>$900 to repair the damage.  After that the mere whisper of the word "battleship" produced results.  In Virgil's words:<br>
<br>
If I cannot bend the powers above, I will rouse Hell.<br>

On March 5, 1917, four months to the day after the massacre <B>on -the </B>"Verona," the greatest labor trial up to that time in the history of the Pacific Northwest began.  The charge had been changed from the murder of C. 0. Curtis, the lumber manager, to that of Jefferson Beard, the deputy.<br>
<br>
The body of Curtis had been exhumed secretly and presumably it had been found that he was shot in the back by fellow deputies, for little mention of his death was made at the trial.  The I.W.W. and Vanderveer had been able to change the venue from Everett to Seattle and Governor Lister had appointed judge J. T. Ronald to hear the case.  Because hundreds, sometimes thousands, sought admittance to the courtroom seating only a hundred, the judge asked the I.W.W. to appoint two "special police" to help patrol the corridors.<br>
<br>
The first defendant, Thomas H. Tracy, was charged with murder in the first degree, "in having assisted, counselled, aided, abetted and encouraged some unknown person to kill Jefferson Beard . . ." The first, "or one of the first," shots fired was from the "Verona" and from a revolver held by Tracy, the prosecution asserted.<br>
<br>
Of the 140 deputies admitted by the State, about half were acknowledged to have been armed with revolvers, rifles, and clubs.  The State brushed aside the Beverly Park outrage as not having "anything to do with this particular case." Then came the parade of State's witnesses.<br>
<br>
One, Owen Clay, a deputy, testified that he had been wounded in the right arm at the outset and had flung himself around the ticket office to be out of the range of fire.  From that position he continued firing blindly with his left hand.  On cross-examination Vanderveer had two questions:<br>
<br>
"Who shot Jefferson Beard in the right breast?" "I don't know," responded the witness.<br>
<br>
"Did you do it?"<br>
<br>
The deputy passed his hand across his eyes.  "I don't know," he answered.<br>
<br>
"Thank you.  That's all," said Vanderveer.<br>
<br>
Mayor Merrill testified that the I.W.W. had threatened to burn the city of Everett.  Fire losses of $100,000 had been suffered during 1916.  Thereupon Vanderveer introduced the annual report ot the hre marshal showing that Everett ha a fewer fire losses in 1916 than in any previous year.<br>
<br>
Sheriff McRae also testified.  "McRae was sober," related Walker C. Smith.  State witnesses described the scene on the dock as McRae hailed the men on the "Verona." One said that the sheriff raised his left hand, one said it was the right, another that it was both
hands.<br>
<br>
The confusion on the dock could account for the diverging testimony.  But one and all, the State's witnesses agreed that Tracy stood by an open window in the main cabin and fired from there.  On this testimony there was no challenge from the defense; Vanderveer was well content to bide his time.<br>
<br>
For the State's case the press table was overflowing - not only the local papers and wire services but special correspondents for Eastern newspapers and magazines.  But on April 2 President Wilson appeared before Congress to ask for a declaration of war against Germany; suddenly the press table shrank by half and the defense case got short shrift in the commercial press.  Fred Moore took over on direct presentation.<br>
<br>
Inasmuch as the State had introduced various I.W.W. publications and songs, James P. Thompson, a national spokesman, was put on the stand.  For three days he expounded the principles of syndicalist industrial unionism over the heated objections of the prosecution. judge Ronald observed drily that inasmuch as the State had intro-
duced the documents, it was fair enough to have them explained.  The defense presented dozens of witnesses - those on the "Verona," and citizens of Everett - to testify.<br>
<br>
One Everett citizen, Thomas O'Niel, was questioned about Wobbly street meetings.  "It started in with rather small meetings," he said, "and then every time, as fast as they were molested by the police, the crowd kept growing until at last the meetings were between two and three thousand people." At first, he said, he had been shocked by the I.W.W. doctrines.<br>
<br>
Then how did he come to join the I.W.W., the State asked.  "In this way, it was not the I.W.W. literature' that convinced me so much as the actions of the side that was fighting them."<br>
<br>
Perhaps the high point of the defense case came when the jury w@s taken to Everett to survey the dock scene.  The "Verona" had been brought over from Seattle and lay at the dock in exactly the position she held during the massacre, with only a bow line to the deck, her stern swung out and away from the dock; the hour was selected so that the tide was the same as during the lethal ten minutes on November 5.<br>
<br>
Then Vanderveer placed a man of Tracy's height in the main cabin exactly where the State's witnesses had testified he stood while firing at the dock.  The jurors were then placed in positions marked on the dock chart used during the trial to indicate where each
witness stood who had testified he saw Tracy firing.  The man standing by the window was invisible! It was a triumph for Vanderveer's patient examination of the scene in the many days he had spent in Everett.<br>
<br>
One of the survivors of the Beverly Park and "Verona" expeditions was on the stand.  The State was trying to get testimony from him that he had picked up shells from the deck of the "Verona." The State was nettled by his negative response.<br>
<br>
"Did you pick anything up from the floor?" the State persisted.<br>
<br>
"I picked up an eye, a man's eye," came the answer.  From the blood-stained deck he had picked up a long splinter of wood on which was impaled a human eye.<br>
<br>
On the crucial matter of the presence on the "Verona" of some armed men, James Francis Billings testified to the beating he had suffered at Beverly Park, which had left him with permanent injuries to back and hip.<br>
<br>
"Why did you carry a gun on the fifth of November?" asked Vanderveer.<br>
<br>
"I took it for my own personal benefit," replied Billings.  "I didn't intend to let anybody beat me up like I was beaten on October 30th in the condition I was in.  I was in bad condition at the time."<br>
<br>
As the trial approached its end, the I.W.W., socialists, and radical unionists of Seattle held one of the biggest May Day parades in the citz's history.  Fifteen blocks long, <B>the parade</B> passed along the principal streets and to Mount Pleasant cemetery where three of the "Verona" victims lay buried.  Minnie Rimer gave a moving description of the commemoration in a letter to Emma Goldman, published in Mother Earth, the anarchist macazine.<br>
<br>
On May Day, 1917, Miss Rimer related, the International Workers Defense League had sponsored a token 10-minute strike at 11:00 A.m. against the threatened hanging of Tom Mooney and Warren K. Billings in the Preparedness Day bomb frame-up in San Francisco.  The Central Labor Council endorsed the strike and workers in the shipyards and elsewhere observed it -many even refusing to work on May Da y at all.<br>
<br>
The parade assembled at the I.W.W. hall, then on Second Avenue South, and proceeded up Seattle's main business artery toward the cemetery.  Miss Rimer reported:<br>
<br>
The parade was the grandest spectacle I ever witnessed in Seattle.  We were four abreast in the line of march which extended from the I.W.W. hall clear up to the Washington Hotel.  Several thousand were
in line; each member of the parade wore a red carnation.  The American flag was carried at the head of the procession, and for this reason the Russian workers declined to march in the line but formed on the opposite side of the street and marched to the cemetery with us carrying the <B>RED FLAG.  </B>All hail to the Russian rebels.<br>
<br>
As the idea of the general strike grew, so grew this idea and by the time we were half way to the cemetery, someone had raised the red flag in our ranks.  At the graves, speeches were delivered in Italian, Russian, Swedish, Hungarian and English.  The "Interna-
tional" and many songs written by Joe Hill were sung.  From the cemetery we went to the county jail where many of the Everett prisoners are incarcerated.<br>
<br>
We gathered around the jail and sang songs to those on the inside.  The prisoners joined in the songs and let it be known that it was only tfieir bodies that were in bondage, but surely not the minds and spirit of this courageous group.<br>
<br>
On the hillside at the cemetery, in accordance with his last wishes, were scattered some of the ashes of Joe Hill, the I.W.W. song writer who had been shot to death in the Utah state penitentiary on November 19, 1915.  At a meeting in the evening the final collection was taken for the Everett Prisoners Defense Fund and one half was voted to be sent to San Francisco for use in the liberation of Mooney and Billings.  In all, some $38,000 had been raised across the country for the Everett defense.<br>
<br>
On May 5, two months after the trial started, the jury returned its verdict, "Not guilty." All 74 men of the "Verona" were released and charges against the I.W.W. who had tried to to Everett on the "Calista" were dropped.  "It is the first victory of the kind ever achieved by labor on the Pacific Coast," claimed the Union Record, "previous trials without exception having been decided against the workers."<br>
<br>
For the I.W.W. it was the greatest triumph of their history, too.  The news flashed through a hundred Wobbly halls from Coast to Coast, setting off impromptu victory celebrations from Boston to San Diego.  Far more important, to 50,000 loggers in hundreds of camps in the Pacific Northwest the news was astounding, something like a Declaration of Independence for workingmen from the barons of lumber.  The refrain of the song "Solidarity,"<br>
<br>
"For the union makes us strong," assumed for the first time reality to lumber workers.  As for the men of the "Verona" and the "Calista," they reported to the Seattle I.W.W. hall for assignments as "job delegates," the organizers of industrial unionism, and began fanning out, with hundreds of others, through the logging and construction camps to carry the message.  For them the moral of the Everett trial was aptly phrased by the famous Mr. Dooley when he said: "Do not ask for your rights; take 'em.  There's something the
matter with the right that is handed to you."<br>
<br>
For George Vanderveer though, his legal triumph seemed to turn to ashes.  Many of his associates, in the hatreds fanned by war, had turned their backs on him as a traitor not only to his class but to his country.  He disappeared for two days after the trial and then showed up at home with haggard face, bloodshot eyes, a bruise on his jaw, and soiled clothes.<br>
<br>
He tried to enlist but was rejected as too old, although in the prime of life.  But for Vanderveer the die had been cast.  He was "counsel for the damned"; his lot irretrievably was to be with those of the lower depths.<br>
<br>
In the lives of many outside the ranks of labor the Everett trial had been a decisive turning point.  A handsome young apple cheeked social worker, training in philosophy at  the  University of Chicago, who had risen rapidly in Seattle to become a member of the school board with liberal-labor support, had taken time off to cover the trial for the New York Evening Post and the Survey.<br>
<br>
To Anna Louise Strong were revealed facts of life which had escaped her at the university and which were to give to "social work" an entirely new meaning.<br>
<br>
For many another the Everett Massacre and trial proved turning points as well.  The ranks of the I.W.W. suddenly began to swell.  Before the massacre there had been but two paid officials at the Seattle hall, Secretary Mahler and Editor J. A. MacDonald of the Industrial Worker.<br>
<br>
By July 4, 1917, one year after the loggers' convention when there had been only 50 paid-up members in the lumber workers union branch, there were now 30 people under pay, working at top speed to take care of the constantly increasing membership.  Locals of the A.F. of L. in the Puget Sound area also began to swell as shipyards expanded and new ones ivere built to meet the menace of the U-boats.  Unions which had claimed members by the score began now to number them by the thousand.<br>

EVERETT MASSACRE.<br>
<br>
Archie Binns, "Men of the Woods," <B>Roaring Land.</B> New York: Robert M. McBride and Company, 1942, p. 84-93.<B>
</B>A logger who kept sober and had good intelligence and luck might work up to a responsible job and marry the operator's daughter, or run for State Senator, and the fact that he had worked in the woods did not count against him any more than his b@'Ing born without shoes.  But while he remained a logger, it was different.  Loggers were looked on as a definite class in a democratic community and no one ever dreamed of their doing anything as undemocratic as developing a class consciousness.<br>
<br>
The rugged individualists of the skid road and the woods seemed the most unlikely candidates for such a thing-and then they developed class consciousness and began to speak in the language of Karl Marx.  Not many of them at first, or all of them ever, but in numbers that doubled and quadrupled disturbinely.<br>
<br>
The I.W.W. movement started in 1905, but it was nearer 1910 when we began to notice slogans painted on stumps along the road "I.W.W. Industrial Workers of the World," "One Big Union," or "Workers of the world, unite," That seemed a strange idea to children, and we won(fered what the workers of the world would do after they had united.  Their thought was that they would all stop work at once, and when a paralyzed civilization tottered on the brink of dissolution, they would say, "So workers are of some importance in the scheme of things? So the world would go to pieces in a week without us? Then we'll get things going again on our own terms-in a world where there are no wage slaves."<br>
<br>
That was the general theory of the I.W.W., though it was modified somewhat afterward.  At first, people did not pay much attention to slogans painted on stumps, and then sometimes on week days in good logging weather, town would be dark and faintly ominous with striking men in stag shirts and overalls snagged off near the tops of their calked boots.<br>
<br>
The Industrial Workers of the World are mostly thought of in connection with logging, but their program was to organize all labor, skilled and unskilled.  In eastern Washington, they had a good deal of success organizing the migratory harvest hands, and their first big conflict was in Spokane in 1909.<br>
<br>
Spokane's most personal wealth came from the surrounding wheat country, and the temper of the city was set by the conservative farmer, and by the Catholic Church, which opposed radicalism.  The I.W.W. were not welcome in Spokane, where their street speakers drew crowds of harvest hands, and gathered in converts all too successfully.<br>
<br>
Spokane expressed its disapproval with an ordinance which made
street speaking a misdemeanor, punishable by a jail sentence-and the fight was on.  I.W.W. got up on soap boxes and protested the violation of free speech until they were hustled off to jail.  They went without resisting while other speakers mounted their soap boxes and followed their line of thought and their path to jail.<br>
<br>
For a while, Spokane enjoyed the excitement of victory, and then the city fathers did some figuring.  They had over six hundred I.W.W. in jail, it was costing thousands of dollars every week to feed them, and a new jail was needed for the relays of speakers who were springing up on every street comer.  Suddenly the city fathers realized that they were victims of an I.W.W. plot to turn Spokane into one big jail and eat the capitalistic city out of house and home.  Spokane restored free speech through a permit system, and turned the boarders out to support themselves.<br>
<br>
West of the mountains there were successful strikes, and strikes that fizzled.  In the process, the loggers got industrial in. surance and sometimes better wages; the operators began sup. plying bedding which included sheets, the loggers' blanket rolls disappeared, and with them the traditional bedbugs.<br>
<br>
As the I.W.W. began having success we heard more about them, and presently the average person thought of them as diabolical enemies of the human race.  Considered from the distance of time, there is little to justifythe picture.  The I.W.W. were a radical organization, and have to be judged as such.  Their organizers were mostly from Middle West farms: young Americans who had a vision of the working class in chains, and set out to strike off the shackles.<br>
<br>
Whether the chains existed and whether they were right or wrong, they were sincere.  The proof is that some of them suffered martyrdom for their Cause, while many others took terrific punishment from clubs and pick handles; none of them got anything more material in return than a precarious living; and no I.W.W. was ever charged by anyone with selling out to the enemy.<br>
<br>
The I.W.W. were often called "Wobblies"; they used the term for themselves, and it is said to have come from their integrity in financial matters.  As an international organization, the I.W.W. organized working men in British Columbia, and they were strong in the lumber region of Vancouver Island.  The loggers' favorite eating place in Victoria was a Chinese restaurant where the proprietor sometimes gave credit.<br>
<br>
Through trial and error, he learned that I.W.W. were a good risk.  When a logger wanted credit, he would ask, "I Wobbly Wobbly?" and if the logger had a membership card, he was approved.  The Chinaman's rough-and-tumble with the letter "W" resulted in the term "Wobbly."
The Wobblies' biggest battle was fought at Everett, thirty miles north of Seattle.  It was a free-speech battle, such as the I.W.W. had won at Spokane, but here they were sparring off against a different kind of city.<br>
<br>
Near the present site of Everett, in 1792, Captain George Vancouver drew his sword, flicked a bit of earth into the air, and took possession of the Puget Sound region in the name of bis Britannic Majesty.  But the British claim did not hold, and little happened around there until ninety-nine years later, when the city of Everett sprang up overnight.<br>
<br>
In 1889, the Rucker brothers observed that back of Vancouver's Port Gardner there was a vast and untouched forest, with the Snohomish River ready to carry logs to the bay; the Great Northern Railway was expected to make its terminus there, and silver had just been discovered at Monte Cristo.  The prospects were so magnificent that John D. Rockefeller and other Eastern capitalists threw in their chips, and Everett was born in 1891 in the atmosphere of a gold rush.  In a few months the shack town had a population of three thousand-a larger number than Seattle achieved in its first twenty years.<br>
<br>
Everett had an acute housing shortage, and the local undertaker filled his coffins every night with transients who rose up in the morning and rushed out to take part in the scramble for wealth in the new city.  Later, he filled them permanently in a wave of robbery and murder, which was finally put down by the Committee of Twenty-one.<br>
<br>
Two years after its birth, Everett had a flock of industries, including several shingle mills, the first pulp mill in the state, a smelter, a shipyard, iron works, a department store, and half a dozen banks; Rockefeller's Monte Cristo mines were develop. ing, @ @nd Everett became the western terminus of the Great Northem, with through trains to Minneapolis.<br>
<br>
Everett grew too fast, and before the town was three years old it was hit by panic and depression: the Monte Cristo mines were a failure, the Great Northern moved its terminus to Seattle, and other enterprises failed.  But Everett was the gateway to immense timber resources, and it was on its way to being a great sawmill town.  It was also the seat of Snohomish County, and its people were determined to hang on to that honor.<br>
<br>
In those enterprising days, county seats were sometimes. changed overnight by citizens of another town seizing the county records and
taking them home.  Snohomish had that covetous look, and the citizens of Everett  took  no  chances;  the  court  house was guarded day and night by men with loaded Winchester rifles.  According to old-timers, the citizens of Snohomish once planned a Trojan Horse Special.<br>
<br>
The train was to carry a State senator, a judge, and other leading citizens from Snohomish; and while Everett was welcoming the silk-hatted gentry, Snohomish riflemen would slip out of the rear of the train and seize the county records.<br>
<br>
The plan got as far as their setting the hour of departure for the Special, and at Everett the reception committee was ready for them-half a dozen young men, smoking cigars, lay in wait in the cemetery which overlooked the railroad bridge.  The cigars would serve to touch off a fuse which led from among the tombstones to half a ton of dynamite planted under the bridge.<br>
<br>
But the Special never came to be blown up.  At the last minute a Snohomish woman had such a lively premonition of disaster that she was able to stop the expedition.  Some of her own family lived in Everett, and she believed the people of Everett would not stop at anything.  She was right: her own nephews were among the young Everett patriots who lay in wait to blow up their kinsmen from the rival town.<br>
<br>
In the spring of 1916, the city of violent background and direct action tangled with the I.W.W. Logging and mill employers and businessmen had organized to break the Wobblies, and when they started a strike among Everett shingle weavers, forty strikers were seized and beaten.  I.W.W. speakers mounted soap boxes on Wetmore Avenue to protest, and were jailed.  Everett had no ordinance against street speaking, and the Wobblies were arrested for infringing on the rights of individual property owners.<br>
<br>
The I.W.W. had done very well in one free speech campaign  by going to jail, and they planned to do it again; but the industrialists of Everett also remembered Spokane, and took counter measures: they ordered outsiders to keep hands off in labor matters in Everett, and when I.W.W. came into town to speak and help fill the jail, they were rounded up and taken out of town in cars.<br>
<br>
At first the Wobblies were merely turned loose at a safe distance.  Later, when they kept coming back, they were beaten; and when they continued to come, more elaborate means were used to discourage them.  Sometimes the Wobblies were partly stripped and beaten with
branches of Devil's Club-a swamp shrub with cactus-like spines-and on one occasion they were made to run a gantlet of clubs and pick handles.<br>
<br>
The punishment the I.W.W. took was remarkable, but it did very little for their cause; most of it happened on lonely roads or by'some water tank where the Wobblies climbed off a freight train-and found themselves surrounded by men wearing white handkerchief arm bands to recognize each other in the dark.<br>
<br>
The battle went on for five months, and then the I.W.W. called for what has been variously described as a free-speech demonstration, an excursion, and an armed invasion of Everett.  On Sunday, November 5. over three hundred Industrial Workers of the World left Seattle for Everett on two chartered steamers, the Verona and the Callists.  According to conflicting testimony the men were: heavily armed; had only a few pistols among them; arrived sober and well behaved; arrived roaring drunk.<br>
<br>
Everett had been notified that the two steamers were sailing, and would dock at Pier 2, and preparations were made to receive them.  The white propeller steamer Verona came in first, her upper deck black with passengers, while the smaller Callists waited farther out, white and dark gray with massed passengers seen through mist.<br>
<br>
On the pier the sheriff and the police force and deputized lumbermen with rifles waited to repel the steamers; in case of trouble there were sbarpshooters hidden in the adjoining piers.<br>
<br>
As the Verona slid in toward the pier, the sheriff raised his hand and shouted to the captain in the pilot house: "You're not allowed to dock here!"<br>
<br>
The captain's answer was drowned out by the I.W.W. shout<br>
of defiance.  The steamer brushed the pier as she drifted in, a deck hand threw the loop of a mooring line over a bollard-and the shooting began, with the other fellow firing the first shot.<br>
Shouting men on the Verona suddenly crumpled as the crackling of rifle fire swelled from the pier.<br>
<br>
The crowd on the steamer writhed and stampeded to the shelter of the far side of the deck; the Verona heeled over crazily, farther and farther, until the one line to the pier came taut, cracking and groaning.  As the steamer lay back on the mooring line, like a lassoed horse, a piece of rail gave way on the listed side, and a dark stream of men poured into the gray, misty water.<br>

The steamer righted somewhat as men crowded into the cabin; the mooring line was cast off or cut, and the Verona backed slowly from the pier, with men at cabin windows and around comers shooting at anything that moved on the piers.<br>
<br>
When the casualties were counted, there were two dead among the<br>
Everett party, five among the I.W.W. and fifty wounded mostly on the steamer.  There were also believed to be a number of men drowned, but in the excitement no one had noticed what happened to them after they spilled into the bay.<br>
<br>
There was other bloodshed after that; but at Everett the I.W.W. first came up against men organized to break them.  It was the first of several armed clashes which were all to the bad as far as the Wobblies were concerned.  Whether they got the best or worst of it, they lost prestige.<br>
<br>
A few months after the battle at Everett, the United States was in the first World War.  The I.W.W. went on striking and disrupted lumbering sufficiently for the Army Signal Corps to organize its own spruce division for getting out airplane lumber.  The Wobblies lost ground steadily, and a few years after the war they had ceased to be of importance.<br>
<br>
Whatever the explanation, the I.W.W. was the only organization that appealed to loggers until recent times.  After the day@ of the N.R.A., the loggers voted to organize under the C.I.O., where they are today.  As much a result of changing times as anything else, their wages and working conditions and hours are better than those for which the Wobblies fought their losing battle.<br>
<br>
Apparently the loggers are satisfied: there is peace in the roaring logging woods producing for war.  The only uneasiness has been at a camp where loggers of a new day drive to work from their own homes.  Tires are wearing out, and the loggers want the promise of a bus if they have to lay up their private cars.<br>

EVERETT MASSACRE.<br>
<br>
Roger Sale, "The Everett Massacre trial in Seattle," <B>Seattle Past to Present.</B> Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1976, p. 119-120.<br>
<br>

The Everett Massacre is treated best and most thoroughly by Norman Clark in Mill Town, and the details need not concern us here.  But the trial was important for Seattle because it was held here and concerned many Seattle people who were among those charged with murder.<br>
<br>
Unlike the Gill trial, it was not a simple frame-up; but, like the Gill trial, it became apparent as the defense proceeded that the defendants would be acquitted, and this was a bitter pill for all who were frightened of the I.W.W. and were determined to destroy it.<br>
<br>
The Star reported as George Vanderveer mounted his defense that there were many witnesses to the massacre, some standing on the dock with Everett's five hundred armed deputies, some standing on the Verona with the Wobblies as they attempted to land, and the wit-
nesses testified that the deputies had been responsible for a good deal of the bloodshed.<br>
<br>
Though Snohomish County Sheriff Donald McCrae insisted he was only defending Everett against the incursions of an outside mob, his men had shot a number of unarmed men who had fallen into the water.  But the Star apparently drew the line at reporting some of the testimony, as, for example, when the prosecutor tried to shake a defense witness and to make him admit there were cartridges on the deck of the Verona after it had returned to Seattle:<br>
<br>
Prosecutor H. D. Cooley: Didn't you pick up anything at all from the deck? Witness: I picked up an eye.  A man's eye.<br>
<br>
Although it could never be settled who or what side had fired first, it could be shown that there were many more deputies than Wobblies, that many of the Wobblies were unarmed, that at least two of the deputies were killed by shots from the dock and not the boat.  None of this did the Star want to believe, or have to print.<br>
<br>
When Tom Tracy and then the rest of the Wobblies were acquitted, the paper once again had to forget the case had ever happened.  This left the paper with only the war to wrestle with.<br>

INDUSTRIAL WORKERS OF THE WORLD<br>
<br>
Gordon Newell, "Maritime Events of 1916," H.W. McCurdy. Marine
History of the Pacific Northwest. Seattle: Superior, 1966<br>
<br>
A bloody chapter in Pacific Northwest history was written at Everett in 1916, with a number of the well-known vessels of the Puget Sound "mosquito fleet" being involved.  The Industrial Workers of the World, a militant and radical association of working men, had its beginnings in the Pacific Northwest among the migratory loggers, sawmill hands and agricultural workers, and had spread across the nation.<br>
<br>
Popularly known as the I. W. W., and its red card -carrying members as "Wobblies," the organization was viewed with unprecedented fear and loathing by business men and most of the established citizenry.  Conversely, few organizations have commanded the fanatical loyalty bestowed upon the I. W. W. by its members.<br>
<br>
Opponents of the movement charged its members with a<br>
variety of acts of violence and sabotage, from driving copper spikes in the fruit trees of eastern Oregon and Washington to setting fire to sawmills on tidewater.  Strikes were organized by the I. W. W. and generally broken by the combined forces of government and the business community.<br>
<br>
The I. W. W. countered with soap box speaking campaigns on city streets.  As "Wobbly" orators were dragged off to jail, replacements lined up to take their places.  Soon many Pacific Northwest communties had no more room in their jails and the I. W. W. soap boxes were still manned.<br>
<br>
When these tactics were tried in Everett, however, vigilantes organized by local business men and backed by law enforcement agencies used more direct methods.  For five months, as I. W. W. leaders sought to maintain a strike of Everett shingle weavers, the vigilantes systematically rounded them up, forced them to run a gauntlet of clubs and pick handles, and sent them reeling down the interurban tracks out of town.<br>
<br>
At this point the I. W. W. organized what it called a "free speech demonstration"; a mass meeting to be held in Everett.  The Everett Commercial Club viewed the demonstration as "an armed invasion," and took forthright steps to repell it.<br>
<br>
On Sunday, November 5, over 300 I.W.W. members met at I. W. W. Hall in Seattle and marched to the waterfront for the steamer trip to Everett.  Capt.  Chance Wiman had recently placed the Verona on the Seattle- Everett route, the Vashon Navigation Co. having been dissolved that year and the steamer removed from the Tacoma - Quartermaster Harbor run for which she had been built in 1910.<br>
<br>
The majority boarded this vessel, but as her capacity was reached, the remainder boarded the Island Transportation Company's Calista, which was scheduled to depart at about the same time as the Verona.<br>

The Verona entered Everett harbor early in the afternoon, a few minutes ahead of the Calista and steamed slowly toward her regular landing at City dock, her decks black with "Wobblies" singing their favorite battle hymn, Hold the Fort.  Along the waterfront, on the American Tug Boat Company stern - wheeler Edison, and at various other vantage points, anned vigilantes and law officers waited grimly.<br>
<br>
The setting was complete for the ensiring tragedy.  As the Verona was sighted, a sawmill whistle bellowed the alarm.  When the steamer neared the dock Sheriff Don Mc Rae of Snohomish County stepped forward and raised his hand to silence the chanting.  "You can't land here," he ordered.<br>
<br>
A roar of defiance answered him from the crowded decks of the steamer.<br>
<br>
As the bow brushed the pier a man on the dock looped a line over a bollard.  At that moment the first shot was fired . . . whether fromship or shore is a question which has never been satisfactorily answered. 5 There was a moment of silence; then for the next ten minutes the Everett waterfront saw violence never squalled before or since.<br>
<br>
Men on the Verona crumpled to the deck as the volume of fire from the dock reached a crescendo.  The violence of the fire may be estimated by the fact that 175 bullets pierced the pilot house of the Verona, where Capt.  Wiman took refuge behind the steamer's iron safe.  To the end of her career the little Sound steamer bore the scars of battle and the nickname of "the Wobbly battleship." The fire was returned from the steamer.<br>
<br>
Deputies and vigilantes began to fall back, killed or wounded.  As the men on the Verona, the majority of whom were unarmed, stampeded for the outboard side to escape the direct fire from shore, the steamer heeled far over, a section of rail gave way, and a number of men were thrown into the bullet-whipped water.<br>
<br>
When the Verona righted somewhat and slack came on the bow line, Engineer Shellgren set his engine hard astern, the line broke and the steamer, bullet-riddled and with blood staining her white sides, shot away from the dock.  In the harbor Capt.  Wiman warned the Calista off, then raced back toward Seattle with the cargo of dead and wounded.<br>
<br>
In Everett, ambulances were picking up more dead and wounded men.  When the score was counted it was found that two Everett deputies were dead; sixteen, including Sheriff Mc Rae, were wounded.  The I.  W. W. had five known dead and 31 wounded.  Most of the men who went overboard were believed to have died, but few of them had families or close friends to be concerned about them.  The number was variously estimated at from two to twelve.
The two steamers were met at the dock in Seattle by police and the surviving red card holders werejailed, 73 of them being indicted on murder charges which were subsequently dismissed.  Although the violence and bitterness engendered by the I.W.W. movement continued for some years, "Bloody Sunday," 1916, was the occasion upon which it most dramatically became a part of the marine history of the Pacific Northwest.<br>
<br>
Capt.  Harry Ramwell, Capt.  Wiman of the Verona, and K. L. Forbes and Ira Howie, Captain and engineer of the Edison were among those who testified the first shots were fired from the steamer.  Other witnesses were equally sure they came from the dock.<br>
<br>
In an earlier effort by several Wobblies to reach Everett from Mukilteo in the launch of Capt.  Jack Mitten, the launch was intercepted by Sheriff McRae and a number of deputies who, according to Capt.  Mitten, opened fire without warning.  He and his passengers were then jailed without charge for nine days.<br>

<br>
In 1916 the bloodiest episode of labor violence in Northwest history broke out in Everett, Washington.  A shingle-weavers' strike that began in May was bolstered by the Seattle IWW, which opened an Everett office and began a free-speech campaign in support of the strikers.  The conflict exploded on November 5, when more than two hundred Seattle Wobblies who had traveled by boat to stage a demonstration were met at the Everett dock by the sheriff and a crowd of armed citizens.<br>
<br>
Five Wobblies and two deputies were shot dead, fifty were wounded, and five others are believed to have jumped ship and drowned.  In this excerpt from his February 1917 Sunset magazine article "The I.W.W. and the Golden Rule: Why Everett Used Club and Gun on the Red Apostles of direct Action," Walter V. Woehlke describes the working conditions that started it all.<br>
<br>
From the I.W.W. and the Golden Rule<br>
<br>
Shingle-weaving is not a trade; it is a battle.  For ten hours a<br>
day the sawyer faces two teethed steel disks whirling around two hundred times a minute.  To the one on his left he feeds heavy
<br>
blocks of cedar, reaching over with his left hand to remove the rough shingles it rips off.  He does not, cannot stop to see what his left hand is doing.  His eyes are too busy examining the shingles for knot holes to be cut out by the second saw whirling in front of him.<br>
<br>
The saw on his left sets the pace.  If the singing blade rips fifty rough shingles off the block every minute, the sawyer must reach over to its teeth fifty times in sixty seconds; if the automatic carriage feeds the odorous wood sixty times into the hungry teeth, sixty times he must reach over, turn the shingle, trim its edge on the gleaming saw in front of him, cut out the narrow strip containing the knot hole with two quick movements of his right hand and toss the completed board down the chute to the packers, meanwhile keeping eyes and ears open for the sound that asks him to feed a new block into the untiring teeth.<br>
<br>
Hour after hour the shingle weaver's hands and arms, plain unarmored flesh and blood, are staked against the screeching steel that cares not what it severs.  Hour after hour the steel sings its crescendo note as it bites into the wood, the sawdust cloud thickens, the wet sponge under the sawyer's nose fills with fine particles.<br>
<br>
If "cedar asthma," the shingle weaver' occupational disease, does not get him, the steel will.  Sooner or latest he reaches over a little too far, the whirling blade tosses drops of deep red into the air and a finger, a hand or part of an arm comes sliding down the slick chute.<br>
<br>
That is the case of the Everett shingle weaver.  "I want all I can get," he says, "because I earn every penny I can squeeze out of the mill owners."<br>

The Everett Massacre<br>
<br>
Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, "The Everett Massacre," <B>I speak my own piece.</B> New York: Masses and Mainstream, 1955. p. 207-213.<br>
<br>
I received from Seattle, Washington, signed "Everett Prisoners' Defense Committee," urging me to come out there to speak and help raise funds.  Another factor which had weighed heavily with us in trying to bring the Mesaba Range case to a quick and satisfactory conclusion, was the very serious struggle which the I.W.W. faced in the Northwest.<br>
<br>
As a result of the Everett massacre on November 5th, 1916, over a hundred members of the organization were in jail in Seattle,
charged with murder.  I was no longer needed on the Mesaba Range.  Joe Ettor planned to return there for a few weeks to have the books of the defense committee audited by the local union, to set up a relief and trust fund to which I have referred and then close up the defense office.  Joe had said definitely he was through.<br>
<br>
His father died, leaving him about $10.000, which started Joe in the wine business in California.  Carlo had returned to the editorship of his newspaper, which was his personal organ, and a pleasant round of festive occasions started among his Italian friends and readers to celebrate his release.<br>
<br>
I wanted to remain with the I.W.W., though Haywood and I were completely at odds by now.  In fact, he protested against the organization inviting me to the Northwest.  This contributed to making me all the more determined to go.  Carlo was shocked and amazed that I would even consider leaving him after he had been in jail since July.  "But you are Out now," I protested, "and all<br>
these men are in jail!" I felt I was right, hard as it was to go.<br>
<br>
I  had never heard then of a "professional revolutionist," but this was a real test of my devotion to my principles and I tried hard to meet it.  Carlo was so angry that he did not write to me for six weeks after I arrived in Seattle.  But my mother and my sister Kathie both sympathized with my problem, and wrote me regu-
larly, so I had news of Fred.  I suffered a great deal from loneliness and worry.<br>
<br>
Fred Moore (from Spokane and Lawrence) and Charles Ashleigh, with whom I had worked in 1914 in the New York unemployed movement, were there.  Both were close friends of mine and understood I was having a bad time.  Caroline Lowe, a Socialist woman lawyer, was busy on the case.<br>
<br>
My old friend, Edith Frenette, who had been with me in Missoula in 1909, before Fred was born, lived in a small hotel up a hill on a side street in Seattle.  I moved into the same place.  She was helping to organize the defense and was an important witness.  She had been arrested innumerable times during the prolonged struggle in Everett and gave me a graphic eye-witness account of the events of November 5th and before.<br>
<br>
Dr. Marie D. Equi, my friend from Portland, Oregon, came over to help.  I went with her to see the men in jail and the wounded at the hospital.  It made me feel a lot better and ashamed of my doubts and misgivings about coming, when I heard their welcoming shouts of greeting to "Doc" and "Gurley." Harry Golden, a youth Of 22, was lying there in a high fever from a festering leg<br>
wound.<br>
<br>
On Dr. Equi's demand, he was removed immediately to a private hospital, but only an amputation saved his life.  He had come to
this country at sixteen from Poland, seeking "liberty." 'Now, six years later, he was a cripple.  He had been shot on November 5th.<br>
<br>
It was on a Sunday when the Everett massacre happened.  A simple flyer had been distributed in Everett, calling for an I.W.W.<br>
open-air meeting at 2 P.M. at Hewett and Westmore Streets.  It said: "Come and help maintain your own and our Constitutional privileges." This was part of the pre-war campaign of the I.W.W. to organize the lumber industry, which centered there.<br>
<br>
The Shingle Weavers' Union, not I.W.W., but an independent union, had carried on a successful strike in the Northwest.  Only one mill, the Jameson Mill, held out.  The I.W.W. co-operated on the picket line and through their street meetings which had not been molested up to August, 1916.<br>
<br>
Then a reign of terror, led by a drunken Sheriff McRae and an employers I outfit, the Commercial Club, was let loose on Everett.  Meetings were broken tip, speakers arrested and beaten.  Roads were guarded by deputy sheriffs against I.W.W.'s entering the city.  Groups of I.W.W.'s were deported out of the city, in a condition which sent many to the hospitals with broken limbs<br>
and internal injuries.<br>
<br>
Citizens of Everett rallied against these out rages and held one meeting, in September, of over 2,000 people, in a public park, at which James P. Thompson, of the I.W.W., spoke.<br>
<br>
On November 5th, 1916, a delegation of 250 I.W.W.'s left Seattle for Everett on a regular passenger boat, the "Verona." The overflow, and many regular passengers , took another boat-the "Calista." The Everett authorities were tipped off by two Pinkerton detectives who were stool pigeon passengers on the boat, pretending to be I.W.W.'s. As it proceeded, one of them raised his hand in a signal and the little boat was ambushed from three sides in a deadly fusillade from the dock and the adjoining piers.  It listed and some men fell overboard.<br>
<br>
It then backed out into the stream and, bullet-scarred and bloody, with a grim load of dead, dying and wounded men, returned to Seattle.  En route, they warned the "Calista" to turn back.<br>
The known l.W.W. death-toll was five-Felix Baron, Hugo Gerlot, Gustav Johnson, John Looney, and Abraham Rabinowitz.  They were French, German, Swedish, Irish and Russian-Jewish.<br>
<br>
Two bodies were later found on a nearby beach, and six who were checked onto the "Verona" were missing, probably wounded and swept overboard.  When the two boats docked in Seattle, thirty eight I.W.W.'s were arrested from the "Calista" and two hundred and thirty-six from the "Verona." The men arrested were surprisingly young.  Thirty were severely wounded.  A passenger, not an I.W.W., was shot nine times and one of the Pinkerton stool pigeons had a
scalp wound.<br>
<br>
In Everett there were two dead, one C. 0. Curtis, an office manager of the Canyon Lumber Company, who was armed and shooting at the boat, and Jefferson Beard, a deputy sheriff.  About sixteen were injured, including Sheriff McCrae.  They were hooted and jeered at by Everett citizens as they were taken to the hospital.<br>
<br>
Mayor Gill of Seattle, who was criticized in the Everett and Seattle papers for allowing the I.W.W. to board the two boats, replied heatedly: "In the final analysis it will be found these cowards in Everett, who without right or justification shot into a crowd on the boat were a bunch of cowards.<br>
<br>
They outnumbered the I.W.W.'s five to one and in spite of this they stood there on the dock and fired into the boat-I.W.W.'s, innocent passengers and all.  McRae and his deputies had no legal right to tell the I.W.W.'s or anyone else that they could not land there." Efforts to start a recall movement against Mayor McGill fell flat.  He ordered that decent food, blankets and tobacco be furnished to the I.W.W.'s in the city jail.<br>
<br>
Nine days after the arrests, all but seventy-four men were released.  These were charged with the murder of Jefferson Beard and C. 0. Curtis.  They had been picked out by the two Pinkertons.  The prisoners were secretly taken out of the jail, heavily hand-
cuffed and taken to the Snohomish County jail, in Everett.<br>
<br>
The others were released quietly, in small groups, not to create public interest.  Thirty-eight I.W.W.'s, taken from the "Calista," were charged with unlawful assemblage.  Conditions in the Everett jail under Sheriff McCrae were frightful, and only a little better after January 8, 1917, when a new Sheriff, McCullogh, took over.<br>
<br>
The I.W.W.'s cleaned the place from top to bottom and finally gained food demands, blankets, etc., by "battleship" methods-
literally hammering the jail apart.  Committees of women were allowed to bring cooked food to the prisoners in Seattle and later in Everett.  I was at one of the "banquets" served on tables set the full length of the jail corridor-a full meal topped off with cigars and flowers.<br>
<br>
Finally, as the date of trial drew near, judge Ronald from Seattle was appointed by the Governor for the trial, and on January 26th a change of venue was granted on the ground of prejudice in<br>
Snohomish County.  The trial was moved to Seattle.  This was a real victory.  On March 5th the first defendant, Thomas H. Tracey, was brought to trial in the King County Courthouse.<br>
<br>
Meantime, I had spoken in every city and hamlet in King County and vicinity and in many throughout the state-as far north as Bellingham and Port Angeles, west to Gray's Harbor, east to Spokane and South to Vancouver and Portland, Oregon.  One of the most impressive meetings at which I spoke was held in Everett
during the month of February, on a Sunday afternoon, in a large hall.<br>
<br>
I said in opening: "We are here this afternoon to present to you the workers' side of the Everett situation." I spoke of it as "a segment.. a miniature of what labor is enduring everywhere, all the time," and instanced the women and men shot and killed in the year 1916 in Bayonne, New Jersey, Standard Oil Company stronghold, "where the Statue of Liberty out in the bay casts her gleaming, light into the very windows of the workers' homes," and where<br>
gunmen shot a young Polish girl through the forehead as she was looking out the window, killing her instantly.<br>
<br>
A worker, not a striker, who ran in fear, had forty-two bullets put in his fleeing body.  I spoke of those beaten, shot, arrested on the Mesaba Range.  I spoke of what I had seen in Lawrence and finally of what had happened right here in Everett.  The working class audience listened attentively, with profound sympathy and then gave a large collection for the defense.<br>
<br>
Wherever I spoke, the reaction of the people was the same, especially in labor circles.  We told the story of what had really happened, that the deputies had killed their own men in the cross-
fire.  Because this was true, the murder charge against the I.W.W.'s involving his death was dropped, after the body of C. 0. Curtis was exhumed and examined.<br>
<br>
In the course of my work on this case, I sometimes had an escort, as a sort of bodyguard, although I had no trouble anywhere.  One was a tall, lean, young lumberjack, who was greatly embarrassed at this assignment, "riding the cushions with a lady organizer." He wouldn't talk, and finally in desperation, I looked out the car window at the majestic Olympic Mountains in the distance and remarked: "The scenery around here is certainly beautiful."<br>
<br>
He answered me laconically: "Can't enjoy the scenery under the capitalist system!" I had an amusing experience with another escort-this time self-appointed, a wiry little fellow who carried my suitcase to the train in Spokane.  Next morning when I got<br>
off at Seattle, there he was waiting to carry the suitcase.  When I asked in surprise: "How did you get here?" he laughed and said: "Rode the rods, Gurley." He followed me to Portland and several other places in a similar manner, bobbing tip smiling to meet me<br>
and carry my bag.<br>

ABERDEEN AND ITS FIRES.<br>
<br>
Edwin Van Syckle, "Aberdeen and its great fires,"<B> The River Pioneers. Early Days on Grays Harbor.</B> Seattle: Pacific Search Press and the Friends of the Aberdeen Public Library, 1982. p. 235-241.<br>
<br>
Friday morning, October 16, 1903, dawned beautifully but grew into a day of terror.  By 8:30 o'clock the warmth prompted Fire Chief E. L. Koehler to start painting the side of the house at the G Street end of the alley between Heron and Hume streets.  He had painted for half an hour when his attention was drawn suddenly eastward to the huge, three-story frame-structured Mack Building at 13 Hume Street.  It housed the Arctic Hotel, leased by Louisa Selberg from Oscar L. Crain.  Heavy black smoke was billowing from the windows of the Mack building.<br>
<br>
Before the thunderstruck Koehler could descend from his ladder, flames began spewing from the first and second floor windows.  Before he could ring the fire bell and assemble the volunteer firemen, the Mack Building was a mass of fire, with the flames jumping the alley northwestward to the L. W. Walker saloon and to the Olympus, a variety house with two tiers of boxes.<br>
<br>
From there the flames and intense heat reached the jail and fire hall, Chief Koehier's hose tower burning like a gigantic torch.  Prisoners were released and told to get into the bucket lines, for the pumpers were failing to stop the spread of fire.  The steam pumper, late in getting up a head of steam, was stationed at the Wishkah Street bridge, while the hand pumper was at the Wishkah at the end of Hume Street.<br>
<br>
Within a few minutes after the fire station went up in flames, the entire block bounded by Heron, Hume, F, and G streets was <B>an inferno- By some miracle the wooden buildings on the north</B> side of Heron between F and G were saved.  Stopping the fire here saved many buildings on F, Wishkah, and G streets, as well as the Commercial block on Market Street.<br>
<br>
The brick faced building of N. G. Kaufman was supposed to resist fire, but it succumbed when flames approached it from three sides, leaving only two walls standing.  After taking the Smits Drug Company building as well as others, the flames jumped Heron Street to the Aberdeen State Bank, which was soon afire.  Continuing northerly and westerly, the fire spread along both sides of Heron Street to Broadway, and to Wishkah and Market streets.<br>
<br>
On the north side of Heron from G to Broadway, every building was destroyed, including two banks and Wolff's big drygoods store.  On the south side of Heron every building except the Grays Harbor
Music Company and the City Livery Stable went up in flames.<br>
<br>
The fire ran northerly on G Street to Wishkah Street, where it jumped to the dwelling of W. B. Mack, which was partially destroyed.  The Ed Hulbert house, the opera house, and several dwellings on the north side of Wishkah Street were burned, while on the south side of Wishkah Street every building from G Street to Broadway burned, including the Central School.<br>
<br>
For a time it was thought the Aberdeen General Hospital on Broadway was doomed, but by blowing up the John Young dwelling at Heron Street on the opposite side of Broadway with gunpowder the fire fighters saved the hospital, as well as many buildings west of Broadway.  C. A. Beardsley, by keeping his house wet, prevented the spread of fire on the north side of Wishkah Street.<br>
<br>
The dwelling of Jacob Kyser at I and Market streets took fire from flying sparks, and only the hardest work saved the residences of J. W. Carey and F. A. Hart.<br>
<br>
In all, the flames licked up twenty acres of the Aberdeen business district and surrounding homes, stock in virtually all stores, and personal property of residents in the numerous hotels and rooming houses.<br>
<br>
When it was realized that the Aberdeen Fire Department could not control the fire, word was sent to Hoquiam, Cosmopolis, and Montesano for help.  Hoquiam dispatched a pumper and a crew of firemen, Cosmopolis put its Tiger hand pumper on a scow and towed it <B>to Aberdeen</B>, while Montesano sent a quantity of which was badly needed as the flames spread beyond the reach of Aberdeen's supply.<br>
Panic and confusion grew with the flames.<br>
<br>
The streets were pandemonium, with homeless women and children seeking safety, merchants desperately attempting to save their stock, and looters boldly delving into the hastily-piled goods.  Everywhere was the crackle of flames, the roar of a virtual firestorm, the crash of walls, roofs, and timbers.  The rain of hot embers was frightening.  Karshner Brothers opened the chicken pens behind their meat market and the birds ran squawking through the streets.<br>
<br>
When it was over three men were dead, 140 buildings were burned, and the fire had caused $600,000 in damage.  Three inmates of the Mack building had lost their lives: Daniel Webster, porter in the Walker saloon, jumped from a window and was so severely injured he died in the Aberdeen General Hospital two hours later; George Rolf, a peg-legged man who formerly kept a cigar stand in the Grand Saloon, was burned in his room; and Samuel Kirkup, a veteran of the
Mexican war, was burned to death in his room on the third floor.<br>
<br>
Colin McKenzie of the Union Transfer Company, who years later was to become a deputy sheriff and be slain in the Wynooche Forest by the madman John Tornow, was caught by the falling wall of the Eagle Dance Hall and seriously injured.  He was taken to St. Joseph Hospital, where it, was found his spine had been damaged.<br>
<br>
Fire Chief Koehler was struck by a falling wall at the Pullman Saloon and "knocked out for a short time." John Steen, while assisting in removing goods from a store at G and Wishkah streets was knocked down and run over by a team.  H. W. Lacy was kicked in the head by a horse; A. Bretburg suffered a cut on the head; John Mills stepped on a nail; and William Oglesby was slightly suffocated" by smoke.<br>
<br>
Within hours of the fire, the Aberdeen Council gathered for two special meetings to pass an ordinance creating fire limits.  No frame structures were to be built in an area from the Chehalis River to the alley north of Market Street and from the Wishkah River to Broadway.  The council was in a hurry because many owners of burned buildings were making plans for immediate replacement of their lost structures.<br>
<br>
Like its sister towns of Aberdeen and Hoquiam Cosmopolis had its trial by fire, this one occurring the night of July 29, 1929, when flames took more than half of the business area.<br>
<br>
Aberdeen had purchased its first fire fighting equipment in 1889, when its town trustees were attracted by an advertisement in a Portland newspaper.  The city of Salem, Oregon, had an old Tiger fire pumper for sale.  This was something that inflammable Aberdeen had needed for some time, so the trustees commissioned Charles T. Wooding, a local banker and the dollar-a-year town treasurer, to negotiate for purchase of the rig.<br>
<br>
Wooding was going to Oregon on business anyhow, and he wanted to take a look at the Tiger<br>
<br>
He returned to Aberdeen a week later, reporting he had purchased the machine and 500 feet of rubber hose for $400.  The equipment came around from Portland in the steamer General Miles, which at that time was operating on a two-week schedule between Portland and Grays Harbor, often as far upstream as Montesano.<br>
<br>
The fire hose, long unused, had become so brittle that most of it promptly broke into four-foot lengths when uncoiled.  The pumper, however, was enough of a fire-fighting rig around which to build a fire company.  Joe Graham and Billy Pearson drew up the papers and
went out to sign up members.<br>
<br>
Graham was first, Pearson second, while B. J. "Jeff" Garman, who had a clothing store at F and Heron streets, where later the Pioneer Saloon was built, was the third member signed.  Then came C. T. DeLoch, clerk in the Maling & Taft real estate office, and M. R. Sherwood and Leon Martin from B. F. Johnson's real estate office.<br>
<br>
These latter three men were the town dandies.  In all Graham signed up twenty men.  The company met the General Miles, rolled the Tiger ashore, and proudly tugged it uptown.  Later they built a garage-like structure for the rig on G Street next to the fire hall and jail.<br>
<br>
Before the Tiger's coming, Aberdeen's fire fighting had been entirely by bucket brigade.  The first Lovelace Saloon at F and Heron streets had burned in 1886.  A bucket brigade of 160 men failed to save it, but did save Aberdeen House from taking fire from it.  The men lined up shoulder to shoulder from the corner down to the Wishkah River and kept a continuous procession of buckets moving toward the fire.<br>
<br>
Jack Waldron and a crew were in the attic of Aberdeen House passing buckets  up  through  a hole in the roof to slosh water over the roof and down the walls.  Then someone, taken with panic, began tossing bedding and furniture out the front windows, and capped the situation by tossing a stove atop the pile.<br>
<br>
Later another bucket brigade saved surrounding buildings when the saloon on the northwest comer of F and Heron burned.  In this case fire fighters took the extra precaution of hanging wet blankets over the walls of the Hood store across Heron Street, diverting some of the water to keep the blankets soaked.<br>
<br>
That saloon was rebuilt, but took fire again, and this time it gave Old Tiger its first job in Aberdeen.<br>
<br>
Someone came pounding out of the saloon shouting "Fire!" Five men grabbed the pull ropes and tongue of Old Tiger and started on a dead run up G Street for a two-wheel turn onto Heron, and then silently over the mushy sawdust to the Wishkah River.  Joe Graham, one of the men on the ropes, thought it strange the Tiger's bell was ringing so vigorously.  He glanced back to see Grover Antrim riding the rig and clanging the bell for all he was worth.<br>
<br>
The pulling crew angled Old Tiger to the bank of the Wishkah, dropped over the suction hose, and uncoiled a replacement of the original fire hose.  Willing hands and strong arms began to pump
the handles, but the tide was almost low and the suction hose had been plunged into the mud instead of the water.<br>
<br>
Rollie Van Winkle came thumping over the dock planks in his rubber boots.  Without a word he jumped into the mud and began pawing a ditch so tidewater could reach the end of the suction hose.  Soon Old Tiger began to take hold, shooting a stream of muck and water.<br>
Ed Koehler, whose store joined the burning saloon, was almost beside himself with anxiety, pacing up and down the plank sidewalk in front of his store.<br>
<br>
Across the street, Dave Keith, thinking his saloon would take fire too, started rolling barrels of whisky and wine out the front door and into the street.  In his haste he let a few barrels get away.  They bounded down the bank into the Wishkah and were promptly retrieved by fishermen, who managed to fill several demijohns before returning the barrels to Keith.  Once the fire was out, Keith himself knocked the bungs out of several barrels to treat all comers, especially the fire-fighters.<br>
<br>
Soon after the first volunteer fire company was formed in the<br>
autumn of 1890, Duffy, who operated "The Fair," a notions shop, was unpacking a shipment of dishes and other goods and throwing the packing material into the street.  He had hung a big brass lamp, an oil burner with a tall glass chimney, from the ceiling with a length of manila line.<br>
<br>
That night, when he lit the lamp for the first time, the flame promptly burned the manila rope in two.  The lamp crashed to the floor.  Duffy, in his haste to get the lamp out of the building, kicked it through the door into the street, where it landed on the pile of dry packing material.  Fed by the lamp's coal oil, the resulting fire soon started to gobble the wooden sidewalk and the street's sawdust fill, until Duffy had a Tiger-size blaze lighting up the whole block.<br>
<br>
A pack of fire fighters appeared, pulling Old Tiger at a gallop.  The flames were soon cooled.  The suction hose had been dropped into a nearby cistern, but not before Frank Moore and Jack Judway, a half breed, had come weaving down the sidewalk. judway usually hit town in his tin pants, red underwear, and calk shoes, with a thirst and a yen to howl.  A few side trips into the bars and he was ready to take on the town.<br>
<br>
This time Duffy's fire seemed to be a good place to start.  Charles Hohler was holding the fire nozzle when Judway, teetering on the edge of the sidewalk, began to jeer and laugh derisively at the fire brigade, attempting to tell Hohler how to handle the<br>
nozzle.  Then-it looked like an accident-the hose flipped and the stream caught Judway squarely in the midriff.  He flopped over
<br>
backwards, while Hohler squirted the stream up the legs of judway's tin pants, the water gushing out the top.  The subdued judway was led away and charged with disturbing the peace.<br>
<br>
Not long after, the volunteer department was to consist of two fire companies, Pioneer Hose Company No. 1, and Wishkah Company No. 2, the latter a hook-and-ladder outfit.  Joe Graham was elected the first fire chief, a job that seemed to fit in with his other job as town marshal.  A keen rivalry between the two fire companies whipped to fever pitch at each Fourth of July celebration, when hose-laying and other competitions were staged.  The two companies continued as rivals until they joined forces to give Hoquiam a lacing.<br>
<br>
A neighbor to the town jail and the fire company was<br>
another Grays Harbor institution of some note, "Paradise Alley."<br>
<br>
A real alley, it ran between Heron and Hume streets, debouching into F Street on one end and G on the other.  At G Street it was guarded by the city jail, police headquarters, and the fire hall.  The F Street end was livelier.  Along its course were a few red lights of unmistakable invitation, a few front doors, a few back doors, and upon occasion a nighttime surge of rough and ready turmoil.  Fires of passion were the only blazes not doused by Old Tiger.<br>

ABERDEEN FIRE OF 1903.<br>
<br>
Ralph W. Andrews, "Aberdeen, 1903, Scotty Campbell screamed for help," <B>Historic Fires of the West.</B> Seattle: Superior Publishing Company, 1966. p. 138-140.<br>
<br>
"In one blazing day, October 16, 1903, Aberdeen came of age.  The big fire wiped out the city of planked streets and wooden buildings and allowed a modern kind of city to grow, one properly zoned, with better fire protection, a more substantial city with new goals and new possibilities.<br>
<br>
"It was a Friday morning.  Up country the corn was in the cribs and the harvest had been brought in from the fields.  On the lower harbor the autumn mists hung low over the salt marshes and flocks of ducks rose up at the approach of a river boat.  There was the wood smoke smell from mill burners and cook stoves hanging close to the
ground until midday.<br>
<br>
"Early that morning Axel Gylfe, the photographer, was hurrying down to his studio at 60 Heron Street to develop some plates he exposed at a wedding the night before.  At the Aberdeen Livery and Transfer Co. at F and Hume Streets the barn man was hitching up a team to move a load of furniture and Emil Pfund, the jeweler, was polishing his silver.<br>
<br>
Most of the sawmills were in operation and up from the busy waterfront came the whine of the saws.  Jim Bowes, proprietor of the Fashion Saloon, stood in front of it at 8 Heron Street to feel the early sun and chat with Les Maley, the cigar maker and bartender Nick Larkin of Walker's Resort for Gentlemen.<br>
<br>
"Toward 9 a.m. over in the Arctic Hotel in the Mack Building at 13 Hume Street some of the late risers were cooking breakfast on an oil stove in one of the batching rooms.<br>
<br>
Charles Rolfe, one of the cooks, hobbled about on  his  pegleg,  making  trips from he Stove to the table.<br>
<br>
"Suddenly   there   was   a   scream   from   Rolfe's room and when the others hurried there they saw it was in flames the searing tongues licking up the thin layers of greasy wall paper and reaching for the ceiling and spreading to all parts of the old hotel.<br>
There was little time to aid Rolfe.  They tried to save themselves.<br>
<br>
It was just 9 by the clock in the old Central School that stood about where the A. W. Barkley store is now and the school bell was calling children to classes.  Suddenly above its hollow clang came the dull booming call of the city's fire bell.  Members of the volunteer fire department listened.  The bell was ringing<br>
wildly.<br>
<br>
"Someone remarked that it would be a good day to test the pumper the city had just bought.  As merchants and early shoppers scanned the sky f or a sign of smoke, they spotted the black column beginning to rise from the corner of Hume and G Streets across from what is now the Whicher Machinery Exchange.  And although the fire station was located almost next door it was several minutes before the firemen could assemble and get their equipment out.  Those several minutes<br>
were critical.<br>
<br>
"Scotty Campbell, hanging by his fingertips f rom the window ledge of his room in the Arctic Hotel, screamed for help.  The long<br>
tongues of flame were shooting out  of the windows  and  the  fire  was  spreading to the roof. Chief Koehler of the Aberdeen Fire Department took in the situation.<br>
<br>
He felt the new pumper Could do the most good if it could pump out of the Wishkah River and he ordered the engine drawn to a spot not far  from the west approach to the Heron Street Old bridge.  The
Department's head pumper, Tiger, was rushed out and put into service.<br>
<br>
But by this time the Mack Building was a solid tower of flames, the fire going in three directions.<br>
<br>
"It was moving north toward the city jail with the roof of that building already smoking. it was threatening to jump G Street and start on the next block west and it was already burning in buildings east of the hotel. It  time for decisions and Chief Koehler made them.  'Call Cosmopolis for help,' he relayed to the telephone office.  And he asked for another call to Hoquiam.<br>
<br>
"The city jail was soon a mass of flames and police Chief Anstie turned both prisoners loose with instructions to aid in fighting the fire.  By this time every member of the local fire department was on duty-Hose Company No. 1; Hook and Ladder Company No. 1; Chemical Company No. I and Engine Company No. I from the headquarters building.<br>
<br>
"And as they fought the fire that building itself was going up in flames.  Other hose companies were called in.  No. 2 from the East side rushed across the Heron Street bridge in a body; No. 3 from over on the corner of Market and D Streets responded and No. 4 came from the West End, their hall at Hume and Michigan.<br>
<br>
"Before 9:30 the fire had jumped the alley and was licking at the backs of buildings facing Heron Street and merchants were fran-
tically trying to remove their stocks ahead of the racing flames.  Shopkeepers from farther west on Heron Street closed their shops to aid, and as word of the disaster spread, several mills - the West and Slade mill on the Wishkah River; the American mill farther up, and the Anderson and Middleton mill, all shut down to permit their crews to go to the assistance of the fire fighters.<br>
<br>
"But still the fire roared.  It jumped G Street into the block that included Toklas and Kaufman's brick department store building.  Surely, the citizens thought, that building will withstand the flames.  The fire will be stopped when it gets to that corner.  But there was no stopping it.  Fanned by a light morning breeze, it jumped Heron into the block between G and H Streets and began to devour one building after another.  If the town is to be saved, it is now, the volunteers told each other.  The fire must be stopped short of the new Elks Temple building, the George Wolff Store.<br>
<br>
"But the area of flaming city was now so great that even with hundreds fighting the blaze, it could hardly be slowed up.  It swept through the block to H Street, racing with the fire on the south side which consumed the Toklas-Kaufman brick block as though it were match wood.  At H it again leaped the street, and while it set off
buildings along Heron Street, the new Fireman's Hall on the corner of Hume and H Streets seemed safe.  But by now it was evident the Elks building would go.  George Wolff was carrying his merchandise into the street in front of the store and stacking it in piles.<br>
<br>
"Into the raging inferno, the volunteer fire departments of Hoquiam, Montesano and Cosmopolis arrived.  The Harbor Queen arrived from the county seat with the fire fighters, while the Hoquiam department wheeled up after a mad dash over the plank road that connected the two cities.<br>
<br>
"It was apparent that water was no solution.  Chief Koehler called a hurried conference.  Something must be done quickly.  It would probably have to be dynamite - then dynamite it would be.  Explosive charges were placed in a building where the old Weir Theater once stood, and the roar of the explosion added to the confusion.  There were also the cries of mothers looking for their children, fire fighters shouting to direct the battle against the flames.  Rumors were spreading of prominent citizens who had been trapped and lost in the fire.<br>
<br>
"With his jail empty, Chief Anstie hurriedly rounded up a troop of deputies and swore them in. The piles of merchandise stacked in the streets, the mounds of personal possessions, must be protected from looters.  Soup kitchens were set up at noon or as soon as they could be organized.  At the Commercial Bakery, manager Bill Murphy fed 200 homeless persons while the ladies of the W.C.T.U. ladled soup to a bread line of fire fighters and burned-out refugees.<br>
<br>
"Sea gulls swooped and screamed through the smoke and rats, burned out of their homes, scurried through the streets and under piles of goods.  The new Crescent Hotel went when the fire jumped I Street, more homes were devoured and clear over to the corner of Wishkah and Broadway, the fire ate its hungry way.  By six o'clock that evening it had been controlled but what had been Aberdeen was now a black-
ened, charred, almost unrecognizable jumble of destruction and human misery.<br>
<br>
"The Aberdeen Bulletin was on the streets by nightfall with a special edition, the paper attempting to survey the loss but it was too soon.  Few people slept in Aberdeen that night and by daylight souvenir hunters were scavangering through the debris.  Bicyclists from Hoquiam and Cosmopolis rode over to see the awesome sight and there were plenty of citizens to provide them with a guided tour of the destruction.<br>
<br>
"Meanwhile the townsfolk totaled up the loss.  In nine scorching hours 140 buildings had been destroyed.  R. T. Dabney was the heav-
iest loser-18 of his 19 buildings consumed by the flames.  Four lives had been lost, three of them in the old Arctic Hotel.  Nearly a dozen were injured.  Savings and the work of lifetimes had been blotted out in what the citizens called Black Friday.<br>

"Less than a third had been covered by insurance.  But from Seattle and Tacoma came offers  of aid to the stricken city.  The council met  and Mayor West thanked the big towns-Aberdeen can take care of its own, was his answer, and the council dove into the heated discussion of the new fire ordinance that would provide for a permanent and substantial business district.<br>

<B>FOREST FIRES IN OREGON AND WASHINGTON</B><br>
<br>
William G. Morris, "The Great Fires of 1902," extracted from "Forest Fires in Western Oregon and Western Washington," <B>Oregon Historical Quarterly.</B> XXXV (1934) p. 333-337.<br>
<br>
The next great fire of consequence after 1868 was in 1902.<br>
<br>
The summer of that year was the most disastrous on record in westem Oregon and Washington in terms of lives and farm property lost in forest fires.  Scores of farmers in the territory east and southeast of Portland for a distance of 40 miles lost their homes, barns, stock, and fences in many separate fires.<br>
<br>
The greatest tragedy was the sudden destruction of 16 human lives in a single burst of flame which swept through the forests of the Lewis River Valley on the night of September 11 and consumed everything in the small farm clearings as easily as it did in the dense surrounding forest.<br>
<br>
Only those settlers who were able to reach Sepley Prairie, where there was a clearing one mile long and one-half mile wide, were able to escape the flames.  In 1902, as in 1868, countless land-clearing and campers' fires were burning in all parts of the country during late August and early September.<br>
<br>
Strong east winds sprang up and the "harmless" fires swept over the 
country with terrifying rapidity in more than <B>80 </B>known places from the Rogue River to Puget Sound.<br>
<br>
The forest fires of 1902 were generated with such suddenness that the news items in the Oregonian increased from practically nothing on September 7, to column after column on September 12.  The first fire to attract attention on September 7, was along the 'Wilson River in Tillamook County.<br>
<br>
On September 8, a fire between the Barr and Sandy roads a few miles east of Portland was driven  by a strong east wind and caused the residents to fight for their homes.  At the same time a fire was burning in the mountains near Forest Grove; others were reported near Vancouver, 'Washington; one was burning near Rockwood, east of Portland; another was threatening the mill at Bridal Veil in the Columbia River Gorge.<br>
<br>
On September 9, a large fire was in progress at Gladstone, near Oregon City, and another between Schubel and Clarkes, east of Oregon City.  The next day the people of Bethel fought to save their homes from an advancing brush fire; at the same time a large forest fire which started somewhere in the Saint Helens country was
driven by a strong north wind during the night so that by morning 
it was only <B>24 </B>miles from Washougal.<br>
<br>
In the midst of these spreading fires it was reported that mdny of the farmers east of Portland were stiff firing brush piles and other debris which might throw new blazes beyond control.<br>
<br>
September 11 was a black day in the spread of forest fires in the region surrounding Portland for a distance of 50 miles.  The smoke was so dense in Portland that it made the eyes smart, and ashes were thick on the streets.  The Oregonian recorded destructive fires on this date at Tillamook, Newport, along the Salmonberry and Miami rivers, at Skye, Washougal, Long Beach, Mehama, Bell Mountain, east of Vancouver, along the North Santiam River, Rocky Butte near Portland, Gresham, Molalla, Multnomah, south of Portland, Springwater, Palmer, lower Puget Sound, and in the fateful Lewis River Valley.<br>
<br>
In nearly every case, strong east winds swept the fires beyond control during the afternoon or evening.<br>
<br>
The smoke was so dense from Portland to the coast on September 11, that artificial light was necessary during midafternoon.  The Oregonian reported that it was as dark as night between Goble and Scappoose along the lower Columbia River, so that the train was lighted at 2:00 p. M. A news item from Astoria reads: "People were badly scared today by an extraordinary phenomenon.<br>
<br>
The smoke backed up from the coast in a solid bank and the setting sun turned the sky a yellowgreen.  All lights were turned on at 3:00 p. m. Girls in the Sanborn-Cutting Packing Company ceased work and got on their knees [to pray] . . . . The Capt. of the Bailey Gatzert was compelled to use his searchlight at 11:00 a. m. and all the way down the river."<br>
<br>
Fires fanned into menacing size during September 11 continued to spread rapidly in most localities on September 12, and devastating blazes were reported at Sand Lake near Tillamook, Dolph, in the Coast Range south of Tillamook, Coburg, Hendricks Ferry on both sides of the McKenzie River, Mapleton, Wendling, headwaters of the Rogue River and Umpqua River, Marys Peak, west of Corvallis, both sides of the Columbia River through the gorge, Wilhoit Springs, Castle Rock, a camp west of Tacoma, Matlock, Enumclaw, Skykomish, Cascade Tunnel, Victoria, north side of the Columbia River near its mouth, Elma, Oak Point, Battleground, Camas.<br>
<br>
At the same time the communities east and southeast of Portland witnessed marching fires that had begun to move across the country on the previous day and continued to sweep through farms and villages until the wind shifted during the evening of September 12.  Some of the communities reporting large losses in their vicinity
were Troutdale, Dodge, Highland, Springwater, Fairview, Lents, Sycamore, Salmon River near Mount Hood, Kilgaver, Gresham, Pleasant Home, Orient, Rockwood, Powell Valley, Damascus, Viola, Logan, Eagle Creek Valley, Beaver Creek, Kelso, Dover.<br>
<br>
September 12 was the smokiest day of the season at many towns such as Oregon City, Salem, Centralia, Shelton, Elma, and Olympia.  Centralia reported the darkness of midnight lasting until 10 a. m. The sun was hardly visible at Salem.  Olympia suffered from a lack of electric lights, because the dry weather had diminished the streamflow at the hydro-electric plant.<br>
<br>
An Olympia news item printed in the Oregonian stated: "By I 1 o'clock the day was as dark as the average night at midnight.  The schools were dismissed and work on the capitol buildings and all outside labor was abandoned."<br>
<br>
At Seattle, Everett, and Eugene the smoke did not reach its greatest density until September 13.  The battleship Oregon was held up at Seattle, horseraces were postponed at Everett, and Skinners Butte was invisible from Eighth Street, four blocks distant, in Eugene.<br>
<br>
Other localities affected by uncontrolled forest fires about September 11 or 12 were: Dallas, Gales Peak to Scoggins Valley, Youngs River, Meadow Lake, Belknap Springs, the old burn north of Willamina toward Hebo, 'Wind River, Mount Rainier.<br>
<br>
The fire which destroyed the mill town and the lives of two boys on the night of September II at Palmer, 2 6 miles east of Portland, was started by a railroad locomotive on September 8, near Bridal Veil, two miles away.  On the fourth day, every available man from the lumber company was fighting the fire, but a strong wind in the evening swept the flames up the hill and Palmer was surrounded almost before the people could escape.  As a Mr. Hamilton was leading his family through the fire, his two boys became separated from him and were lost.<br>
<br>

Many homes were burned and seven mills suffered losses near Elma, 'Washington, east of Grays Harbor.  Refugees were reported pouring into Elma on September 12, and at the same time some residents of the town were moving out.<br>
<br>
Heroic fights were made by the farmers to keep fires from their homes in many communities east of Portland.  Graders, ploughs, water and backfiring were used.  The Oregonian of September 14, stated that one of the most valiant defenses was made at Powell Valley, 14 miles east of Portland, where the farmers tried to keep the fire from crossing to the west side of the Troutdale road near
Littlepage's house and Elliot's store.  The Friday evening lull in the wind gave rest to men, some of whom had been without sleep for four nights.<br>
<br>
Losses of farm structures east and southeast of Portland were almost numberless.  The Oregonian of September 14 reported: "Nearly every farmer living in the territory covered by the postoffices of Springwater and Dodge has been entirely burned out.  The flames of the last few days have come from ... former fires, which were only a smoldering mass and were brought to life by a wind from  the  east  so  fierce  that it blew a tubfull of water from Mr. Lovelace's roof ... An area 15 miles long and three miles wide burned from Rocky Point westward between the Clackamas River and Cedar Creek.  Reports indicated that the fire moved forward at a rate of two miles per hour.<br>
<br>
Death rode through the Lewis River Valley in the flames of the great Yacolt fire on the night of September I 1. A reporter from the Oregonian who visited the scene of the tragedy stated: "The cause of the various fires which have brought such destruction are really unknown, though many theories are held by the inhabitants of the affected country.  There seems to be no doubt that more than one fire sent the sparks flying through the air to waiting brush piles and dead timber, where the breeze soon fanned the small blaze into another hurricane of flame<br>
<br>
. . . Small fires were seen simultancausly on outlying hills so distant from one another that the theory that all the fires sprung from one blaze seems iinpossible."<br>
<br>
One  fire  came  down  the  Lewis  River,  while  another   came<br>
from the hills between Kalama and Lewis rivers.  The paths of these two fires intersected between.  Ariel and Yale.  The fire which came down the Lewis Fiver Valley was believed by some people to have been started by two strangers who touched a match to the slashings on their timber claim.<br>
<br>
Another theory is that a fire was started by careless campers on the Muddy, an affluent of the north fork of the Lewis River 30 miles east of Yale.  A third fire consumed timber on the Coweman River north of the Lewis River; it is not known whether this was a branch of the Lewis-Kalama River fires or whether it started separately.<br>
<br>
Three families who had camped across the river from Yale were driven from their stopping place by a fire coming down the Siouxon Creek.  They tried to escape the flames by lying along the bank of the Lewis River, but all were found suffocated by the smoke.  In a house half a mile away, a woman and two children were burned.  Forty people who reached Speleyah Prairie were saved.  Sixty people
at Trout Lake near Saint Helens were reported to have escaped the fire by taking to rafts.<br>
<br>
As soon as the losses in the fire swept communities became known to the more fortunate towns and cities which escaped relief funds were raised to provide food, clothing, and shelter.  State and city officials appointed committees to collect donations.  The Oregonian of September 28 listed the cash receipts which totalled $9150.  This money, in addition to great amounts of donated food and clothing was sent to Camas, Battleground, Cape Horn, Lewis River, Elma, Lents, Sycamore, Bridal Veil, Clarnie, Springwater, Gravel Hill, Salmon, and Reuben districts.<br>

FOREST FIRE OF 1902<br>
<br>
Neva Howard Roberts, "Some Stories of the Howard Family, the fire of 1902," <B>The Sou'wester.</B> XXIII (Winter, 1988), p. 78-79.<br>
<br>
Early in September 1902, after a period of drought, there came a day of very low humidity and the sun failed to rise, or so it seemed.  In Montesano, I have been told, people went about with lanterns and many were scared that it was the 'End of the World.'<br>
<br>
The cows came to the barn in midmorning and the chickens went to roost.  The dogs barked and the sky was completely dark.  Father said he didn't think it was the End of the World, but probably a bad forest-fire.  By mid-afternoon it lightened up somewhat, I can remember that, and Dad and Mama were walking about between the house and chicken house when Dad caught a leaf in his hand.  It was plainly a burned vice-maple leaf, intact, and Dad said, 'Yes, it's a forest fire.'<br>
<br>
How remarkable that leaf had been carried up on the heat-draft, crossed the mountains from the Chehalis Valley and came down in Brooklyn, all without breaking the leaf! When the sky lightened it was blood-red.  It made Mama's petunias red.  Grace said to me, 'You know they're really white.  It's the red sky that makes them red.' I didn't believe her, but next day went out to look, and sure enough they were white.  Though I was only four, it impressed me so that I always remember the dark day.<br>
<br>
The fire had started somewhere near Elma and ran all the way to the
Sound at Shelton and at Olympia.  Millions upon millions of feet of timber were downed and couldn't be salvaged.  There were only a very few roads and only horse teams to get out the logs and take them to mills.  Fortunately, a few trees survived the fire, though badly burned.<br>
<br>
They could be seen for many years, with a stand of seedlings about their feet, always with their trunks blackened and their tops burned off, but a few green boughs left.  Now, after seventy-five years, the hills are completely forested-in fact much of the new growth is being harvested and the ground replanted by hand.<br>
I don't know of anyone losing their lives in that fire, but many families used drastic means to save themselves.  Some got into the river to save themselves but lost their chickens and livestock, along with all their buildings.<br>

But regardless of what people thought, or feared, or guessed or didn't bother to think or fear or guess - 1910 was to be the year of what some termed the "big blowup," or the "big burn," or the "time when the mountains roared."<br>
<br>
It was a series of 1,736 fires that ravaged three million acres' and killed eighty-five, possibly eighty-seven, people, particularly during August 20 and 21 - the two most grueling days of searing hell.  And the undermanned, underequipped national forests did not help the situation.  With abnormally low amounts of precipitation and soaring, high temperatures, disaster threatened imminently.<br>
<br>
By 1910 the nation had made significant progress in its movement away from "frontier freebooting," a philosophy which had lead to the reckless and wholesale exploitation of natural resources - including America's forests.  In 1891 Congress had authorized the withdrawal of forest reserves from the public domain, and in 1897 legislation had insured the proper care, protection, and management of the public forests.<br>
<br>
Authorization for employing "guardians" of the forests had been granted; in addition, the reserves had been opened for regulated use only.  A start had been made in directing the nation toward a policy of wise use and conservation of resources.<br>
<br>
In 1898 Gifford Pinchot had been appointed first chief of the Division of Forestry of the Department of the Interior - the forerunner of the Forest Service.  Pinchot was the nation's first native professional forester, experienced in managing a large private forest in North Carolina and personally familiar with many of the new forest reserves.  In 1905 Congress transferred the forest reserves to the Department of Agriculture, and the Bureau of Forestry became known as the "Forest Service."<br>
<br>
An once for District One of the Forest Service, which administered timberlands stretching from parts of Michigan to northeastern Washington was set up in Missoula, Montana, in 1908.<br>
<br>
District Forester William B. Greeley and his assistant, F.<br>
A.     Silcox, were hard put as to how they could most effectiv@ ely use their meagre manpower: each man in the service was responsible for 250,000 to 400,000 acres.  Early-day forest rangers, riding
<br>
horseback over mountain trails, were primarily custodians of the forests, protecting them from fire, game poachers, timber and<br>
grazing trespassers, and exploiters of various sorts.<br>
<br>
Not only undermanned, but also underequipped, the national forests were lacking in lookout points, trails, telephone lines, pack trails, tools, and tool caches - especially in the heavily timbered areas of westem Montana and nonhem Idaho.  Nor were the private forest industries or railroads particularly prepared to develop significant fire protection or fire-fighting measures.<br>
<br>
The Forest Service had finally been able to set up a basic organization for combating forest fires in early 1910.  It looked like a plan might be needed, for ominous signs presaged debilitating fires.<br>
<br>
The moisture situation was a dramatic departure from nominal: average precipitation in the northern Rocky Mountains being ten to twenty inches annually in valleys and forty to sixty inches locally in many of the mountainous areas.<br>
<br>
In 1909 some parts of neighboring Washington state reported precipitation to be the lowest in forty years.  As early as March 1910, abnormally low amounts of moisture and soaring, high temperatures were recorded.  In Montana and Idaho, temperatures for the month of April were the highest on record.  And no relief was in sight by the time May rolled around.<br>
<br>
In June the statistics were becoming even more frightening: the annual precipitation in District One was averaging only one-half inch.  And most weather stations in the area reported no rain in July.<br>
<br>
By August the United States Weather Bureau was classifying the area as being in a state of unprecedented drought, with streams measuring record lows.  Sluggish rivers and creeks ran low and tepid; trout fought for the few remaining shady, deep pools.  Brown-edged, dull, brittle pine needles and parched underbrush covered forest floors.<br>
<br>
Territorial patterns for wildlife changed as watering placer; dried up or had to be by-passed because of algae and stagnant, brackish water.  Even loggers on the nominally cool "hoot owl" shift found the air stifling, the trees that they felled dry, the skid roads hot and dusty.<br>
<br>
What appeared to be welcome rain clouds frequently welled up in the
skies to the west and they dryly scudded on east, marking up still more frustrating, rainless days for the parched Northwest.<br>
<br>
Clarence B. Swim of the Foreat service declared: "The late summer of 1910 approached with ominous, sinister, and threatening portents.  Dire catastrophe seemed to permeate the very atmosphere.  Through the first weeks of August, the sun rose a coppery red ball and passed overhead red and threatening as if announcing an impending disaster.  This fiery red sun continued day after day.  The air felt close, oppressive, and explosive.  Drift smoke clouded the sky day after day."<br>
<br>
August was an anomaly.  While precipitation was dangerously down, temperatures had dropped to unseasonable lows.  In some places in Montana mean temperatures were ten degrees below average.  The Weather Bureau claimed that the phenomenon was caused by smoke in the atmosphere.<br>
<br>
In an effort to induce the much-needed rain, dynamite was exploded at Wallace, Idaho.  The theory was that thunder and lightning caused rain; therefore, "manufactured" thunder and lightning should also bring precipitation.  The Missoulian of August 17 reported that dynamite had been exploded spasmodically in the town for sixty hours, with only one shower of rain falling.<br>
<br>
The entire weather situation startled the fledgling Forest Service.  They had hoped for cool, wet weather to help make the job of setting up a basic fire-fighting organization in the twenty-two national forests of District One less overpowering.  There was to be no such reprieve.<br>
10<br>
The Fires<br>
<br>
The first forest fire of the 1910 season began in the Blackfeet National Forest of northwestern Montana on April 29.  In rapidfire succession several other burns charred District One.  Privately, forest supervisors were told to gird up for a nasty fire ,season and to purchase the necessary fire-fighting equipment.<br>
<br>
If District One Forester William Greeley was disturbed by the fires, he did not make his feelings public . In early June he claimed that fire danger would be reduced and that he looked forward to the best yet for the five-year-old Forest Service.<br>
<br>
By late June fires were burning in all the forests of the district, most of them in nonhem Idaho and western Montana.  During the first two weeks of July, ne w fires sprang up almost daily.  Some of them were contained, but many were not.  By mid-July it was clear that the forest fire situation was the most dangerous since 1889.<br>

While most Forest Service jurisdictional boundaries of its almost twenty-six million acres in the district were clear, a few key ones were not.  Glacier National Park, for instance, had been created by Congress on May 11, 1910.  No money had been appropriated for protecting the park from fires.<br>
<br>
Nonetheless, when serious fires broke out in the park during mid-July, District Forei;ter Greeley dispatched irire fighters from the neighboring Flathead and Blackfeet National Forests to prevent park fires from spreading into the two forests.<br>
<br>
Greeley stated in the July l7, 1910 Missoulian: We could not wait to make the necessary inquiries from Washington - the situation was too serious - so we sent men from the two forests mentioned to fight the park fires; the matter of meeting the expenses will be settled afterward."<br>
<br>
A number of matters had to be decided afterward.  There wasn't suiticient time to settle them at the moment, nor was there time to wait for the bureaucracy to act.<br>
<br>
One of the more pressing problems was the lack of manpower.  By mid-July, $6,000 had been spent in one week on fire fighters' wages in the Coeur d'Alene National Forest alone.  Many of the men were paid on thejob by special "disbursing agents" who were ordered to the scene.<br>
<br>
It was soon decided that instead of paying fire fighters to meet specific emergencies and then release them, it was better to hire as many temporary men as possible and keep them on the payroll to meet future needs.  These employees.; became known as "temporaries." Almost overnight the number of men working for the Forest Service soared to the greatest height in the history of the agency.  Not all fire fighters were paid by the Forest Service.  Railroad, mining and lumber companies and protective associations also supplied large numbers of men for the task.<br>
<br>
How could the Forest Service, with district offices in Missoula, Montana, keep track of the fires and fire fighters? Generally they could not.<br>
<br>
The worse fires straddled the Continental Divide between Idaho and Montana in the Coeur d'Alene and Lolo National Forests, along the Bitterroot Range, where fires were breaking out at a rate of three to four per day.  The situation was bad, but it was going to get worse.<br>
<br>
Primitive transportation, lack of communication and firefighting equipment, rugged terrain, inadequate numbers of experienced fire fighters and supervisors, and tinderbox conditions in the forests were only some of the problems that plagued effective fire fighting.  
If these handicaps weren't enough, reports reached the press that some of the ragged, tattered "temporaries" were setting fires themselves to help inguie their continuing employment.  By today's wage standards, twenty-five cents per hour may seem poor, but for 1910 it was a good wage.<br>
<br>
Many of the temporaries were hired at Spokane, Missoula, and Butte, where they had been on unemployment roles for long periods of time.  Some were drifters, ex-convicts, escaped prisoners, vagrants.  As Chief Greeley put it, "It was a case of hiring anyone we could get.  We cleaned out Skid Road in Spokane and Butte.  A lot of the temporaries were burns and hoboes.<br>
<br>
In a bad fire year the temporary is the weakest link in the chain...they loafed on the job; some of them quit on the job, but we did have splendid crews from the logging camps and wonderful assistance from Butte miners."<br>
<br>
Equipment for the temporaries had to be bought from local stores.  Axes, shovels, saws, mattocks, tubs, coffee pots, frying pans, blankets - all sold like proverbial hotcakes.  Soon the items were gone from store shelves.  Adequate food supplies became a problem.<br>
<br>
But men who were fighting fires had to be supplied, for over three thousand small fires and ninety major conflagrations were burning in July.  Many fires simply were ignored.  Although the building of fire lines or the starting of backfires sometimes halted or retarded the devastation of the forests, many fires nevertheless roared and crackled and popped and devoured thousands of acres of the West's finest trees.<br>
<br>
It is somewhat surprising, therefore, that on the last day of July, Supervisor Greeley told the news media, "We are holding our own against all the fires within the jurisdiction of [the] district." But Greeley's words had hardly been uttered when both the Lolo and Coeur d'Alene forest fires erupted anew during the first week of August.<br>
<br>
Within roughly 100 miles of Missoula (generally north and west) fires broke out, encompassing parts of the Rock Creek and Greenough area, the Seeley Lake and Glacier Park regions, and the Arlee and Dixon areas of the Flathead Indian Reservation.  The region west of Missoula, the areas around Taft, Paradise, and St. Regis in Montana, and the Grand Forks area of Idaho were among the real and potential victims of forest fires.<br>
<br>
Fires that were miles in length burned on the Montana-Idaho border.  Fires erupted in the Bitterroot Valley south of Missoula.<br>
Charges were leveled against some landowners who lived in an area
<br>
infested by spotted-fever ticks.  They had allegedly set fire to underbrush and small timber, hoping to clear out the wood ticks.<br>
<br>
The manpower pool was running dangerously low.  Not only were additional men needed to fight'fires as they sprang up, Jmt replacements were needed to spell the exhausted, sometimes injured or dead, fire fighters in the forests.<br>
<br>
In early August, 100 to 150 men per day were being recruited from places such as Butte, Missoula, and Spokane.  By August 5, 1,200 to 1,500 men had been employed to fight fires.<br>
<br>
Nervous Forest Service supervisors asked President Taft to send United States troops to help fight the fires.  On August 8,<br>
Taft ordered troops to stand by.  They would be released on demand to the Forest Service for fire-fighting duty.  Troops at Fort Afissoula and Fort William Henry Harrison in Helena were expected to help, but at the time they were on annual maneuvers in Washington state.<br>
<br>
Wallace, Idaho, was the most threatened settlement in ihe Coeur d'Alene National Forest, and possibly in all of the forests.  William G. Weigle, Coeur d'Alene National Forest Supervisor, ordered two companies of United States soldiers from Fort George Wright (Spokane), Washington, on August 13.  They arrived in Wallace the following day.<br>
<br>
Two days later, 100 blacks of the 25th Infantry from Fort Missoula, commanded by white officers, arrived in Wallace.  Some troops were sent to fight fires, others were assigned a waiting game until they heard from Weigle.  Temporarily, at least, Wallace seemed out of imminent danger.<br>
<br>
But the same could not be said for most of the forests which suffered devastating fire damage between August 10 and 20.  Reports filtered in from the Clearwater, Lolo, Cabinet, Flathead, Blackfeet, and Kaniksu National Forests that fires were racing along faster than a man could walk.  Civilian fire fighters and the military worked together to control the fires, and as August 20 neared, it seemed that simple techniques such as backfires, trenches, and pinching flames into less valuable timber stands were bringing hard-fought victory.<br>
<br>
It looked like Supervisor Greeley's statement of August 17 might be true - that only an exceptional wind could truly endanger the area.<br>
And as it happened, the wind that started on the afternoon of August 20, 19 10 was exceptional.  A gale of hurricane force swept through most of the national forests of northern Idaho and western Montana.  
<br>
The hardest-hit areas were in the Clearwater and Coeur d'Alene National Forests of Idaho and the Lolo and Cabinet National Forests of Montana.  Although fires had been burning on several Forest Service lands and on some private land, what came to be called the "big blowup" basically started in the Nez Perce National Forest near Elk City, Idaho.<br>
<br>
It then scampered across the Clearwater National Forest and continued through the Bitterroot Range into western Montana.  This was a wind-fed fire - a wild, surging, fierce screaming, unrelenting furnace-like fire that lapped up trees and wildlife and buildings<br>
and men.<br>
<br>
The heat of the fire and the great masses of flaming gas created powerful whirlwinds that mowed down trees in advance of the flames and fed oxygen to the fires, which swept thirty to fifty miles wide across mountain ranges and even rivers.  There was no stopping it - the fire was a killer that could not be fought; at best, only avoided.  As ranger John S. Baird described the fire-fighting situation, "We honestly did our best, but it was not good enough on that fire."<br>
<br>
The wind of the blazing demon roared and blew with such force that it threatened to topple seasoned riders from their horses; it howled and screamed and downed mammoth trees.  The heat was unbelievably intense.  As the red mass boiled and swirled, and snapped and snarled dragonlike, it swooped down on ranger Ed Thenon's crew of thirty men on Moose Creek in the Selway National Forest on August 20.<br>
<br>
About ten o'clock that night the sky was aglow with a pink color spread across a width of several miles - in strange contrast to the pitch dark it had been in the afternoon when the crew had set up camp for the night.<br>
<br>
Thenon was awakened by pine needles and debris falling on his tent, but it wasn't until Louis Fitting @takenly thought he saw a falling star begin a fire across the creek from the camp that Thenon ordered his men to move the supplies to a sand strip on Moose Creek.  They couldn't overrun the fire, so Thenon ordered his crew to get in the creek, lie down and put wet blankets over their heads.<br>
<br>
Two of the men were driven senseless from fear.  The cook became violently insane and was forced by three men to lie in the creek.  Thenon wrote that the second man was "dancing around and singing a lullaby," and that although a wet blanket was thrown over the man's head, he wouldn't lie down.  Nevertheless, the crew somehow managed to survive as the crown fire passed over them - a red, breath-taking monster.<br>
<br>
Thenon later wrote that he stuck his head in a bucket to escape the heat and thus saved his life.  The unfortunate "lullaby boy," as
Thenon called him, did not regain his rationality, and the demented man had to be institutionalized.<br>
<br>
One of the crew was a near-casualty.  He had gone to the creek for water and was almost killed by a falling dead tree that had been charred in the fire.  Lou Fitting's brother, Ray had left camp<br>
earlier to scout the fire  situation  in  the  North  Fork  of  Moose Creek.  When the fire hit, he took refuge in Moose Creek under an overhanging ledge.  By keeping under his coat in the creek, he managed to survive - but as dead fish began to float by him, he wondered - if the water was hot enough to kill the fish, would he be boiled alive?<br>
<br>
It was indeed fortunate that no lives were lost in the Clearwater Forest.<br>
<br>
Although the Pend Oreille National Forest was not burned as extensively as many, several fires broke out in the region.  Most fires occurred near the towns of Clark Fork and Cabinet, Idaho.  It was in one of three forests in District One where fire fighters lost their lives.<br>
<br>
A relatively small fire was burning in DeFaut Gulch, a small, dry ravine near Cabinet, Idaho.  W. E. LaMonte and his crew of ten men worked hard, and they managed to bring the fire under control.  The exhausted crew was camped about one mile from the fire line in a two- to three-acre clearing.<br>
<br>
As the big burn rushed along to rekindle the fire, William T. Brashear, a forest guard in charge of the area, ordered the men to soak their clothes and bedding in water and to place their blankets over their heads and lie down near the spring in the middle of the clearing.<br>
<br>
Two men, dazed or demented, threw off their bedding, rushed into the fire, and burned to death only a few yards from where the rest of the terrified crew lay.  J. Plant and J. Harris were their names.<br>
Forester Edward G. Stahl wrote that the flames were hundreds of feet high, "fanned by a tornadic wind so violent that the flames flattened out ahead, swooping to earth in great darting curves, truly a veritable red demon from hell."<br>
<br>
Four men were killed in the Cabinet National Forest - all in the Swamp Creek fire.  Much of the damage occurred in the Clark Fork Valley, where homesteads, towns, and sawmills were destroyed.  The railroad station at Tuscor was burned, and a sawmill at Trout Creek was obliterated along with 13 million feet of white pine lumber, and horses and pigs.<br>

<br>
Although H. S. Kaufman was the forest ranger in charge of the area, Roy Engle of Noxon, Montana, was directly in charge of a crew of about twenty-five men working on what was known as the Swamp Creek division of the Tuscor fire.  On August 21, Engle's group was working along Swamp Creek about one dozen miles  from its mouth.  Kauftnan was working with a crew along the Clark Fork at the mouth of Swamp Creek.<br>
<br>
Kaufman ordered Engle to bring his men out of the area, for they were in danger of being trapped by the raging inferno.  As the fire closed in on them, Engle headed up Swamp Creek to a large body of slide rock.  They stopped on the denuded hillside, digging holes in the rock for further protection.<br>
<br>
The fire swept up the gulch and side hill, a top fire consuming everything in its path and throwing burning brands among the men.  Five men on the verge of dementia panicked and clambered wildly over the slide rock and up the mountain.  The fifth man in the escape group saw that the others were doomed and hurriedly tumbled back to the slide rock area, burned severely but not fatally.<br>
<br>
The Forest Service report stated, "The other four men perished when the fire- struck them.  Several other members of the crew were more or less burned, and all of them were nearly blind from smoke and heat." The names of fire fighters George Strong, George Fease, E. Williams, and A.G. Bourette were added to the fatality list.  This incident occurred about midnight on August 20.<br>
<br>
The Coeur d'Alene National Forest lost more timber and human lives than any other area in District One.  It also had more towns and fire fighters than any other, forest.  And it had a folk hero - Edward C. Pulaski 4 descendent of Polish Count Casimir nilaski, a hero of the American Revolutionary War.<br>
<br>
Pulaski knew the country well, having prospected much of the area for nearly one quarter of a century.  The forty-year-old Pole was in charge of about 150 men in the Big Creek area of the St. Joe and Big Creek branches of the Coeur d'Alene River.  When the hurricane struck, Pulaski was checking on his crews on Placer Creek, southwest of Wallace, Idaho.  Pulaski was going to lead a crew of about forty men toward Wallace, about ten miles away.<br>
<br>
About midway through the trip, Pulaski realized that f'ireaad stopped the crew's progress.  Although some of the men began to panic, Pulaski assured them that they would be safe.  As they headed for the shelter of two mines located ahead, fire was rapidly lapping at their rear.  Pulaski inspected the tunnels to determine their relative safety: the tunnel of the War Eagle mine seemed best, perhaps because it was the larger of the two.  Forty-three men and two horses headed toward the War Eagle, and forty-two men and two
horses reached the safety of the tunnel before the fires struck them.<br>
<br>
One man had chosen to run.  The Daily Idaho Press of Wallace reported in its August 22 issue: "Three of the rescue party walked over the man where he lay on the trail, supposing the body to be a burned log.  On the return all recognized the body for what it was.  The man was terribly charred."<br>
<br>
Pulaski ordered the men to lie down with their faces on the tunnel floor, while he hung blankets overthe tunnel entrance.  He continued to throw water on the blankets and nearby timbers until he fainted.  Somehow the laws of physics worked against the crew, for the cool air was sucked from the tunnel, and the heat and smoke were forced in.<br>
<br>
Everyone lost consciousness at least some time during the ordeal.  One man recovered and scrambled the five miles or so to Wallace for help.  He arrived about 3 a.m., August 21.  A rescue party was hurriedly assembled and sped to the tunnel.  The men were dragged from it, and five were found dead from suffocation.  The rest of the crew, including Pulaski, ultimately recovered.<br>
<br>
Almost three years later, the Sunday Star of Washington, D.C. (July 20, 1913) was singing the praises of Pulaski, claiming he had withstood an emergency "such as sear the souls of lesser men."<br>
While Pulaski and his crew had suffered through a hell-onearth nightmare at the War Eagle tunnel, ranger John Bell's crew had scurried to the clearing on Joseph Beauchamp's homestead on the Middle Fork of Big Creek.<br>
<br>
The clearing had a small stream running through it, and Bell and his crew of fifty or so crammed into the shallow stream and laid face down in it.  Seven of the men hid in a small storage cave which Beauchamp had dug.  First came the violent windstorm which snapped off nearly all the trees in the area.  The crown fire followed with heat so scorching that the men in the creek had the skin on the back of their necks and the hair on the back of their heads burned off.  A tree fell on three men, killing them, while the seven men in the cave burned to death.<br>
<br>
The "cave" may have only been a prospect hole five feet in length, according to the Daily Idaho Press of Wallace on August 23.  The newspaper declared, "The men were burned to such a crisp that they could not be removed from the tunnel prospect hole, so they were buried there, dirt being thrown over the hole."<br>
<br>
That same issue of the Daily Idaho Press carried yet another description of the grisly scene at the Big Creek fire.  "The sur
-
vivors were startled to see a person in human form, but who resembled a ghost more than anything else, suddenly fall over a log and crawl under another.  His clothing had been mostly burned off and his body was fearfully burned.<br>
<br>
"He was raving when the other men rescued him and it was necessary to drag him from underneath the log.  He breathed his last soon after being carried to water." The Press gave a death toll of thirteen for the fire, three more than does Elers Koch in his "History of the 1910 Forest Fires in Idaho and Western Montana."<br>
<br>
Six hours after Wallace citizens had been notified of the fate of the Pulaski crew, a survivor of the Bell crew notified residents that yet another team of men was in danger.  It took the Wallace rescuers two full days and nights to open a trail to the injured crew twelve miles from Wallace.  The ten men were buried at Beauchamp's clearing.  The balance of Bell's crew was hospitalized at Wallace.  They all recovered.<br>
<br>
Still another crew was trapped in the hurricane of August 20.  Twenty-five-year-old ranger William R. Rock, with about see on Setzer Creek, about six miles northeast of venty men, wer<br>
Avery, Idaho.  Rock first tried to head toward Avery but was cut off by fires.  He turned, instead, toward an area that had burned the previous day.<br>
<br>
But the rather spectacular nature of the smoke and flames which sometimes shot thousands of feet into the air led to the death of a crew member - Oscar Weigert - who was so frightened by the phenomenon that he apparently thought death preferable to suspense and certain torture.  He deserted the crew and shot himself with a pistol.  He was the only casualty in the Rock crew.<br>
<br>
However, Setzer Creek near Avery was the setting for yet another horror.  Ranger R. N. 'Debitt, who was in charge of the Avery District, sent a deputy sheriff on the night of August 20 to warn a seventy-man crew to skedaddle for Avery.  Most of the men<br>
heeded the command, but twenty-eight of them decided that both Debitt and the deputy were exaggerating the situation.  So - they decided to stay in the forest.  No one lived to tell of or write about what happened.<br>
<br>
All twenty-eight were burned beyond recognition within hours after they had been ordered from the woods.  They were found at the extreme head of Storm Creek, the next drainage west of Setzer Creek.  Rescuers wrapped the bodies in blankets, sewed the remains in heavy canvas, and buried the men where they had -fallen.  And so oni of the most dramatic episodes in the big blowup death saga remains a shadowy, eternal mystery.<br>
<br>

Lee Hollingshead was a twenty-two-year-old ranger in charge of a sixty-man crew on the West Fork of Big Creek.  On the evening of August 20, when the men were fighting a fire that was rapidly dancing from Trout Creek, they were surrounded by fire, except for nineteen men who had snaked their way through the torturous fire line to sanctuary on a previously burned-over area.<br>
<br>
Again, panic lead to death as nineteen fire fighters rushed down the hill ahead of the fire to a small cabin where five packhorses were stationed.  The structure, known as the Henry Dittman cabin, was surrounded by flames, but the men stayed inside until the roof began burning and falling in on them.  They rushed from the cabin and tried to break through the onrushing fire line, but the engulfing, mindless, raging fire consumed the bodies of all but one within a few feet of the cabin.<br>
<br>
The lone survivor managed to wander to the St. Joe River, where a search crew found him.  Nearly nude, with the skin on his hands and face burned off, the benumbed fire fighter recovered following a six-week hospital confinement.<br>
<br>
Hollingshead returned to the death scene the next day to find the remains of eighteen men, five horses, and a black bear.  The blanket-and-canvas-enshrouded remains of the men, none of whom could be identified, were buried where they had perished.<br>
<br>
Like Hollingshead, ranger James Danielson was only twentytwo years old that August when the mountains roared.  Danielson had a crew of eighteen men on the Stevens Peak fire five miles south of Mullan, Idaho.  Danielson led his men to a small clearing in the forest where they burned the beargrass in hope that the fire would not burn the area a second time.  But it did.<br>
<br>
The men covered their faces with blankets and decided to tough it out in the clearing.  Although the fire touched the area, the blankets saved the men, who suffered badly burned faces and hands.<br>
<br>
One man accidentally inhaled the flames and died on the spot.  The rest were sent by pack train and by a Northern Pacific special train to Wallace, where they were hospitalized for one to six weeks.  Three continued to suffer stiff hands, but the rest fully<br>
recovered.<br>
<br>
Forty-year-old S. M. Taylor was in charge of fighting the Bullion fire along the Montana-Idaho line east of Wallace.  Taylor's crew of about sixty men was surrounded by fire, but he led them to the tunnel of the Bullion mine.  Larry Ryson was one of the fire fighters who assured Taylor that the tunnel would be a safe place to wait out the fire, because Ryson himself had helped to build it, and
he knew it well.<br>
<br>
The men - except for eight - penetrated the shaft far enough to pass an overhead air vent.  Smoke poured down the air shaft and suffocated the eight who were nearer the mine entrance, but the rest were spared.  The dead were buried on the site.  About ten days later, when the Northern Pacific's tracks and trestles had been repaired, the bodies were disinterred and brought to the railroad tracks, where a special car took them to Dorsey.<br>
<br>
However, the trestle there was still burned out, so the bodies were transferred to yet another special train which had been sent from Wallace.  The corpses were delivered to the Wallace morgue and prepared for burial.  A few days later the remains were buried in the Wallace cemetery.<br>
<br>
Deaths were being announced with depressing regularity as the big burn swept the forests.  Fire fighters in the Coeur d'Alene forest alone accounted for seventy-two deaths.<br>
<br>
For a week or so after the holocausts of August 20 and 21, it seemed that more names would be added to the list of the dead.  Ranger Joe B. Halm's crew had been battling fires in the Ceur d'Alene National Forest in the Bean Creek area near the headwaters of the St. Joe River since late July. The fire-fighting success had been so good thatjust before the big blowup Halm had reduced his crew from eighty-five to eighteen.<br>
<br>
When the men saw the fire bearing down on them on the fateful day of August 20, they neared hysteria.  Halm ordered the men to stay in camp and sternly punctuated his order with a hand on his holstered revolver.  The frightened men sought safety on a gravel bar in the middle of Bean Creek.  Despite sixty- to seventy-mile-per-hour winds, falling trees, and scorching fire, Halm's crew survived.<br>
<br>
They picked their way through the charred, still-warm forests toward Wallace.  Six days later they met a messenger from Wallace, part of a search party led by Assistant Forester Roscoe Haines.<br>
It took them one week to claw through the scattered and broken twisted mass of trees and snags that looked something like jack-
straws.<br>
<br>
In some places the debris was five trees deep.  But they had managed to survive the big blowup and wend their way out of an immense, blackened death trap that had engulfed many others.<br>
<br>
Perhaps like Edward G. Stahl, a Forest Service employee who walked out of a forest fire in the Cabinet area that same summer, the men thought that the small fires flickering dimly in the darkness high on the blackened snags which they had struggled through could be
candles burning for the dead.<br>
<br>
THE TOWNS<br>
<br>
Men battled the big burn not only in the forests, but also in the towns.<br>
<br>
The largest, and also the most threatened community, was Wallace, thirteen miles west of the Idaho-Montana border.  Wallace's 6,000 residents first became aware of the onrushing forest fire about 2 p.m. on August 20, when a column of smoke was spotted.<br>
<br>
The progress of the fire was relatively slow that aftemoon, but it relentlessly bore down on the town from the southwest.  Before sunset the wind began to howl.  William W. Morris, an assistant in the Coeur d'Alene National Forest in 1910, described that scene from a nearby vantage point: "Never had any of us seen such a wild sight.<br>
<br>
In the direction of the city of Wallace great masses of smoke were blowing wildly up the great valley of the South Fork.  Southward toward the St. Joe River stood a great white cloud pillar, apparently still, looking like a great thundercap, or the steam cloud that attends the eruption of a volcano.  Many of the men thought it was a cloud and predicted rain at last.  Westward the sun was setting in a flying black mass, looking like a great red ball of fire.<br>
<br>
Our high ridge gave us a wonderful view.  The weird scene greatly impressed them, and one could not help having the feeling of fear and awe which the scene produced, as if a great tragedy was about to happen.  Many fire fighters @ other parts spoke of this later.  They said the very air was afire.  And tragedy was taking place in all<br>
these regions."<br>
<br>
By 6 p.m. Mayor Walter Hanson had ordered every able-bodied man to report for fire duty.  He threatened them with jail if they disobeyed.<br>
<br>
The fire fighters tried to set backfires and to counter the im-
pending flames, but they were forced to quail bef ore the oncoming killer fire and wind.  As the winds increased, fire began in the east end of Wallace at the Times newspaper office about 9 that night.  Most of the fire had come from Placer Creek Canyon and had swirled over the hills flanking the canyon entrance on the southwest edge of town.<br>
<br>
It hit with an incredible fury.  The wind was so strong that the firesjumped over the major section of Wallace and struck at the east end of town, even though they had come from the southwest.
Patients from the Hope Hospital were quickly transferred to the hospital in Osburn, four miles to the west.  Providence Hospital, with twenty-five patients and a like number of sisters, nurses, and attendants, was threatened.<br>
<br>
They were all crammed into a rescue train of the Northern Pacific Railroad (actually only an engine, tender, and caboose), which sped them through the burning hills toward Missoula and the refuge of St. Patrick Hospital.<br>
<br>
People buried possessions in their yards.  One family on the edge of town convinced a group of men to help carry their grand piano up the Burke road to an old mine tunnel for safekeeping.<br>
<br>
Fires gobbled up telephone and telegraph lines, but before communication was cut off, Mayor Hanson was able to make a number of important calls.  The fire station was ordered to sound the bell for evacuation; from the army the mayor requested troops to help load relief trains; the police chief was advised to open the jail and take prisoners to the city park for safekeeping; and officials from the town of Kellogg were warned that people from Wallace would be coming that way, mostly with only the clothes on their backs.<br>
<br>
People scrambled madly to leave the burning town.  The exodus toward Osburn and Kellogg to the west was erratic.  Some rushed to rescue families, possessions, and pets.  Others wildly ran to help neighbors and friends and relatives.  Still others frantically tried to save records, money, or goods from their businesses.  Some possessions had been carefully packed earlier by those who had anticipated the dramatic moment of departure.<br>
<br>
Some people had bundled up belongings in sheets or old blankets because they had tarried too long and had time to do nothing else.  Others were barehanded, carrying only themselves toward hoped-for safety.  Some residents stayed in Wallace, determined not to leave.<br>
<br>
But most headed for the railroad ards, where special evacuation trains of the Northern Pacific Railroad and the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Line had been made up earlier.  When the evacuation bell rang, it signalled pandemonium at the railroad yards.  People were at their best - and their worst.  Men helped women and children into limited space on coach cars.<br>
<br>
One man roughly pushed a pregnant woman aside and tried to take her place in a coach.  The yardmaster threw him off, along with a drunk man.  A mother handed her baby to a friend while she clambered aboard.  The brakeman slammed the door shut since the car was full; but when he saw what had happened, he opened the door, and the child was quickly handed up to its panicked mother.<br>
<br>

Contrary to Mayor Hanson's orders, some able-bodied men jumped on the relief trains.  Hanson ordered the 25th Infantry to throw them off; many of them, however, still clung to the sides and tops of cars and found places in boxcars and fiatcars.  Some hugged the sides of engines and coal tenders as the trains snaked on their hegira out of harm's way.<br>
<br>
While many relief trains headed east toward Kellogg and Spokane, an engine with a caboose came to Kellogg from Saltese, Montana, to the east.  This was the train that spirited away the Providence Hospital patients and staff.  The train hooked up to a length of boxcars at Mullan and chugged back east across the Bitterroot Range over Lookout Pass, returning to Montana.  More people boarded the mercy train at Taft and at Saltese, Montana; the train picked up frightened refugees along the route to Missoula.<br>
<br>
This and other relief trains dumped 1,000 to 2,000 people per day on the Montana city for several days as homeless refugees were driven from the fiery blazes that threatened to consume<br>
them.<br>
<br>
Those who stayed behind in Wallace fought all night for their homes and businesses.  At midnight Mayor Hanson declared martial law, and troops patrolled the streets to prevent looting.  By morning the fires had begun to dissipate, and two-thirds of the town had been saved.  Probably $1 million worth of property went up in smoke and flames, and two persons were killed - an unidentified man who burned in the Michigan Hotel and John Boys of Wallace, who died trying to rescue his pet parrot from his burning home.<br>
<br>
Fortunately, Wallace had a good water supply.  Many area newspapers carned this item datelined August 22, Spokane: "Beer is being used at Wallace for drinking purposes in place of water.  The water supply ran short Saturday [August 201 when fire attacked the town and all still and cistern water was turned into the city mains.  Mayor Hanson issued orders that none should drink the contaminated water and gave all saloons permission to keep open Sunday."<br>
<br>
Other towns were either burned or bypassed, with no apparent pattern.  The unpredictable fire storm struck with pitiless fury or not at all.  Mullan, Idaho, seven miles to the east of Wallace, was unscathed.<br>
<br>
The town of 1,700 was clearly threatened, with the fire bell ringing constantly and the hose cart of the fire department in continuous use.  Home owners used garden hoses to wet down houses and put out fallen brands that came hurtling into town.<br>
<br>

Women and children were evacuated by relief train.  Members of the citizens'committee patrolled the railroad station area with brickbats and guns.  No able-bodied man left Mullan by train.  After a while, not everyone was certain that train evacuation was best, anyway.  Reports filtered in that the town was surrounded by fire.  Perhaps, many reasoned, it would be better to stay in town, where chances of survival might be better than taking an eastbound relief train which had to ease across vulnerable trestles and rights-of-way that were but narrow ribbons through heavily forested terrain.<br>
<br>
A rumor spread that a trainload of people from Wallace had already been trapped and burned to death.  Those who had not refumed to their homes in response to the rumors and fears soon did so, when word came from the railroad that fire had eaten into the railroad yards at Wallace to the west and no trains could get through.  There was no place to go but home.<br>
<br>
They went, and their town was spared, with the exception of Tent Town, where transient miners had lived.<br>
<br>
Avery, Idaho, was a railroad town directly in the path of the big burn.  The superintendent and chief carpenter of the Mssoula division of the hhlwaukee Road directed the evacuation of the<br>
small community.  Women and children were sent on their way toward Missoula within thirty minutes.  A company of black soldiers of the 25th Infantry stood guard on the platform of the cars as they made their way east.  The men of Avery and the balance of the soldiers followed in boxcars.<br>
<br>
Part of the community was saved thanks to Thaddeus A. Roe, a ranger, and seven men of Avery who stayed behind after the relief train chugged out of town.  They fired the buildings on the outskirts of town and began to force a backfire toward the big blaze.  Roe wrote of the wall of fire eating its way down the hillside toward Avery and of the backfire creeping toward the big blowup.<br>
<br>
When the two met he declared: "Never have I seen anything like it. Plunging at each other like two living animals, the two met ivith a roar that must have been heard miles away.  The tongues of fire seemed to leap up to heaven itself and after an instant's seething sank to nothingness.<br>
<br>
We had won, but the strain of those four and a half minutes [the time it had taken for the backfire to meet the main fire] had exhausted us, and we sank down and lay there in the ashes babbling incoherent thanks to God.<br>
<br>
"The rest ofthe world didn't know what we were going through.  It couldn't, and that was the terrible part of it.  We might have been
the only men in the world for all it mattered.  Alone, we were left nothing but our bare hands and the help of our'Creator to bring us out alive."<br>
<br>
Avery was the western terminus of a Milwaukee Road section that ran from Deer Lodge, Montana.  It was also a center for rescue operations, on either side of the Taft tunnel during the<br>
1910 fire.<br>
<br>
Grand Forks, about midway between Taft and Avery, was a rough-and-tumble town of laborers and camp followers. fire storm swept into town, residents raced ahead of it, scurrying for Falcon one mile away.  The wild wind-fire quickly lapped uP Grand Forks.  Next, a telegraph message clicked in to nearby Kyle that Falcon, too was endangered.  The work engine sent in relief steamed from   over burning bridge  timbers  to   Falcon and picked up the refugees from Grand  Forks and Falcon as fire engulfed that little railroad town.<br>
<br>
Engineer Johnnie McKedon coaxed his train back to Kyle and picked up several people at that settlement, which had also begun to burn.  McKendon then gingerly nudged his mercy train over a fire-weakened trestle between Kyle and Stetson and stopped to rescue the section crew there.  Finally, the overburdened little train, with men clinging to the locomotive and hanging from the running boards, triumphantly whistled safely into Avery.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, another work train had made a mercy run up the east slope of the Bitterroot Divide to the Taft tunnel, picking up refugees along the way.  These nearly 400 homeless people found temporary sanctuary in the two-mile-long tunnel.<br>
<br>
Just east of the Idaho-Montana border, the Nonhem Pacific tracks passed through Borax Siding, Taft, Saltese, Haugan, and DeBorgia, and then joined the main line at St. Regis.  The towns were in line with the fire storm as it crossed the divide into Montana and spread into the Lolo and Cabinet National Forests.<br>
<br>
Taft, DeBorgia, Henderson, and Haugan, all along the St. Regis River, were destroyed.<br>
<br>
Taft had ballooned to an "end-of-the-tracks" railroad construction town a couple of years earlier.  The town had a population of several thousand during the days of railroad building, which included the construction of the Taft tunnel.  But by August 20, 1910 the town had no more than two or three hundred people.<br>

As fire coming over Lookout Pass threatened to consume the town on the night of August 20, all women and children were evacuated on the refugee train from Wallace when it wended its way through Taft about midnight.<br>
<br>
Ranger J.E. Breen of the Taft Ranger Station, who was determined to save the town, took charge of a group of citizens who proved to be of little assistance.  In addition to the fire, firewater was at work in Taft that Saturday night and early Sunday morning.  The men were apparently trying to drink the town dry before fire consumed the precious alcohol.<br>
<br>
The town went up in flames, except for the hotel, a small building, and some Forest Service lumber.  One man - probably drunk - was badly burned and taken to Saltese for medical care.  He was left in the care of a friend, who also had too much to drink, and as a result, the friend accidentally ignited the burned man's bandages with a match.  The unfortunate man was set afire for a second time, and he subsequently died.  His was the only death in the Lolo forest.<br>
<br>
At the time the Wallace-Missoula relief train came through DeBorgia, fire danger was not imminent; consequently, no passengers boarded.  But before dawn Sunday morning (August 21), town constable and hotel and bar owner Joseph A. Mayo was warned that the fire was closing in, making evacuation necessary.  Mayo ordered a relief train which steamed in from Missoula.<br>
<br>
Lolo Supervisor Elers Koch swung down from the train and tried to organize a crew to set backfires.  But it was too late for that, as Koch soon realized, and everyone was ordered to board the harried relief train when it returned from its mission to neighboring Haugan.  The order was as obeyed except by a few people who stayed and successfully kept their property from burning to the ground.  Joe Mayo's memoirs, however, claim that the few buildings were saved not necessarily by people, but by "freakest winds."<br>
<br>
Three or four buildings survived, while the rest of the town's sixty-eight buildings were consumed.<br>
<br>
Most Haugan residents eagerly clambered aboard the Nfissoula-bound iron horse panting at the siding, ready to speed them to hoped-for safety.  A few laggards stayed in the hotel bar, vowing to deplete the liquor supply before the fire depleted them.  At the last minute they boarded the train, apparently with the hotel owner waving a liquor bottle at the fleeting:games which seemed to follow them all the way to St. Regis, several miles to the east.  The town was leveled.<br>
<br>
Saltese, to the east, wasn't threatened until the afternoon of August 21 (Sunday).  Several fire fighting crews were trying to save
the town when a work train from Afissoula lumbered in.  It was en route to Wallace, but could not get there because of burned out bridges.  The section crew refused to work, and they were joined by a group of "toughs" who had been picked up as refugees.  The two groups commandeered the work train down the tracks toward Missoula.<br>
<br>
Soon they returned, blocked by burned bridg*e-s to the east.  Since bridges had been eaten away both east and west of town, they were forced to join in fighting for Saltese's life to save their own necks.  Backfires were set and buildings were hosed-down, forcing the fire to skirt the town.<br>
<br>
The fire that consumed one-third of Wallace and destroyed Taft, Haugan, Henderson, and DeBorgia swept north in the Cabinet National Forest, crossed the Clark Fork Valley, jumped the river and finally ran itself out in the Kootenai Forest of Northern Montana.<br>
<br>
Before the hurrican fire spent itself in the Kootenai National Forest, it threatened but never reached the town of Libby, for the sated maniac was dead.<br>
<br>
Aftermath<br>
<br>
Weather conditions precipitated the 1910 big burn, and weather conditions ended the fires.  On August 22 the winds calmed and humidity increased.  The following day light rains began to gently fall on most forests in District One, and snow fell on higher elevations.  Temperatures dropped.  Not all of the fires were extinguished by the cooling moisture, and crews continued to mop up through August.  For all intents and purposes, as August ended, so, too, did the big burn.<br>
<br>
In the swells of the aftermath, the Forest Service was wiser and, in the long run, better equipped to fight wild fire and manage national forests.<br>
<br>
Timber eventually grew back, but much of it was inferior to the original stands.  Some forests were replanted.  Certain types of soil erosion and insect infestations can be blamed on the 1910 fire.<br>
Railroads became more careful about setting fires along their rights-of-way; the Milwaukee Road was even electrified at a later time.  Citizens became more minfful of, and careful with, the use of fire in the national forests.  Congress began to appropriate more funds for fire fighting, for fire research, and for properly manag-
ing the nation's forests.<br>
<br>
Parts of the burned areas succored new life forms, as sheep were brought in to graze on the fireweed, hollyhock, and other plants
that blossomed following the fire.<br>
<br>
However, about  $13.5 million worth of damage resulted, and about 3,000,000 acres of private and federal forest land burned, totaling 7.5 billion board feet of timber.  The lost timber could have been used to construct 50,000 to 55,000 four-room houses.  Another interesting analogy speculates: if one continuous freight train were coupled together with 35,000 board feet per car, that train would stretch 2,400 miles.  The cost of fire fighting to the government was $800,000.<br>
<br>
Even as late as February 1911, a ranger reported finding still-
smoking snags sticking up through five feet of snow in the Clearwater country.<br>
<br>
In terms of human life, fatalities probably numbered at least eighty-five, perhaps eighty-seven - including seventy-eight employed fire fighters and seven civilians.  Seventy-five died in the Coeur d'Alene National Forest: seventy-two fire fighters, one prospector, and two people in Wallace.  Four were killed in the Cabinet National Forest, two in the Pend Oreille.  One civilian died at Taft, Montana, and three homesteaders perished in the Kaniksu National Forest near Newport, Idaho.<br>
<br>
The remains of fire fishiers who had been temporarily laid to rest where they had fallen were exhumed and placed in cemeteries in Wallace and St. Maries, Idaho.<br>
<br>
Wildlife also perished.  A former ranger wrote: "If you could see a little black bear clinging high in a blazing tree and crying like a frightened child, you could perceive on a very small scale what happened to the forest creatures."<br>
<br>
For at least a time people in the nation, and for that matter, even in other countries, realized that hellish fires had burned in Idaho and Montana.  Daylight was shut out as far north as Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada; as far south as Denver; and as far east as Watertown, New York.  To the west, officers of a British ocean vessel 500 miles out of San Francisco said that they were unable to take observations for ten days because of smoke in the atmosphere caused by the big burn.<br>
<br>
Some claim that smoke from the big blaze reached one-third of the way around the world.<br>
<br>
But the spirit, the will to fight back against disaster, is strong in the West.  This intrepidity is reflected in an article -of the Daily Idaho Press, August 27, 1910.  It stated: "Inside of one year Basil Rizzonelli has been burned out at Falcon, on the Milwaukee Road, three times.  The third time occurred when the torest fire [of 19101 swept through that section a few days ago.  The loss was about
$1250 on the building and lumber, though  $1500 worth of supplies was saved.<br>
<br>
"Mr.  Rizzonelli put up a tent following his second fire and has been building the new hotel around it.  The structure was partly finished when fire hit that section again and destroyed the building as well as the lumber.  The business has been carried on right along despite the calamities that have befallen it.<br>
<br>
"When asked if he would rebuild the Falcon hotel, Mr. -Rizzonelli remarked, why, yes, what else can I do? After awhile it will stop burning."'<br>
<br>
It's inconceivable that a fire of this magnitude will ever again occur in the United States.  Smokejumpers, lookouts, aerial detec-
tion and retardant planes, much improved communications, better weather forecasting, lightning and fire research and a welldeveloped trail syswm, would seem to make the chances of such a fire happening again too remote to seriously consider.<br>

FOREST FIRE OF 1910.<br>

<br>
The following document was found in AGO #1705710, Records of the Adjutant General's Office, General Correspondence, 1890-1917. Record Group 94. United States National Archives. It was found by Professor Marvin Fletcher of Ohio University in Athens during "...a black studies project..."<br>
<br>
The author of the report was commander of one company of the 25th Infantry. This all-Black regiment had been created as part of the Regular Army shortly after the Civil War. The regiment, and probably some of the men in Company G who helped fight the fire at Avery, Idaho, had participated in the Indian Wars, on Strike Duty in 1892 in the Coeur d'Alene mines, in the capture of the Spanish position at El Caney, and the conquest of the Philippine Islands.<br>
<br>
Fort   George   Wright,    Washington September 7, 1910<br>
The Adjutant,<br>
Fort George Wright,<br>
Washington<br>
Sir:<br>
<br>
In compliance with telegraphic instructions from the Adjutant General, Department of the Columbia, Vancouver Barracks, Washingto-I have the honor to submit the following report: . . .
[The company including one officer, 53 enlisted men and one bospital corps man.  They  arrived <B>in </B>Avery' on the morning of August 17, 1910. At that time there were only two fires near Avery of any consequence.  The first four days from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. were spent on the fire about four miles east of the town, which was threatening the railway right-of-way.<br>
<br>
The trench system was used, a trench about four inches deep and two yards wide being dug several yards in front of the fire and then a patrol left to put out any sparks, brands or flames that niigbt leap the trench.<br>
<br>
One man had three ribs fractured by a falling tree and it was necessary to send 12 miles for the railroad physician.  He left the next day for Wallace, Idaho, and the entire surrounding country was without medical attendance except the hospital corps man.<br>
<br>
The various fires in the St. Joes canyon soon became unmanageable and fire fighters, settlers, miners, etc., were rapidly driven into Avery.  The towns to the east were evacuated one by one and the populations of these towns took refuge in Avery.  Therefore, on the fifth day, at the request of Mr  Debitt [R.M. Debitt, Assistant Forest Range who was in charge of the Avery area] the troops were drawn off the fire line to preserve order in the town.<br>
<br>
On Sunday morning, August 21, 1910, a very strong wind arose from the west and lasted all day.  It seemed to unite all the fires in the St. Joe Canyon and it was estimated that 20 miles of solid fire line was approaching Avery.  Mr. Debitt and the Deputy Sheriff, H. H.D. McMullan, who had arrived on the scene, went west on a special engine to inspect the fire zone.<br>
<br>
They telephoned me to get all the women and children out and to notify all the rest of the people to be ready to get out at a minute's notice.<br>
<br>
Two special trains were made up one for the women and children and one for the men who desired to go.  Soldiers were stationed at the doors of each car, the windows were fastened down and the cars were filled with water cans.  The engineers had orders to make a dash through the fires and the soldiers were instructed if absolutely cut off on all sides, to take the women and children into the river keeping them together as well as possible avoiding a stampede. Both trains reached safety but from the reports of the train men and the soliders they had a terrible time.<br>
<br>
The fires appeared to be coming in two waves, the smoke, roar and heat preceding the fire for miles, and I am sure no person left ever expected to get out alive. All hope of saving anything was given up. A meeting of those remaining was held in the station to decide upon a plan regarding the best means of saving life.
I took no active part in this meeting beyond stating that the troops would go with the greatest number of people, because I did not know the country and was not familiar with forest fires.<br>
<br>
Upon the advice of Mr  Debitt and the Deputy Sheriff it was decided to make a march up St. Joe River and try to reach the head, although persons desiring to try another means of escape were to be permitted to do so.<br>
<br>
<B>An </B>old mining tunnel on the edge of town was stocked with provisions and covered with wet blankets and a few old men and lame men were allowed to stay there.  This was deemed safe for a few, but it could not have held any large body of men.<br>
<br>
The procession was started, but we had hardly gone half a mile when it was very apparent that we could not get through that way.  This was towards evening and we turned back into Avery.  One train load of men then started east.  The fork of the St. Joe runs along the track to the east, and although it was known that all the bridges east of Avery were burned out and many tunnels caved in, they thought if they could reach an old burn about five miles east they might be safe.  Avery is a division point of the Chicago, Milwaukee & Puget Sound Railway, so there were plenty of cars and engines.<br>
<br>
Mr. Debitt and a few men took blankets and prepared to take to the river at the fork.  The Deputy Sheriff and I were agreed that the river would not do.  Subsequent events proved that it would not have been safe.  It was only about a foot and a half deep alongside of the town, but as it grew much deeper farther up we thought we would have as many drowned as burned.  Falling trees almost dammed it in some places and many would have been killed that way.  Further, many dead fish were afterwards found in the river and the creeks, evidently due to the intense heat.<br>
<br>
Deputy Sheriff H. D. McMullan and his deputy, C. J. Sullivan, Company G, 25th Infantry, and the remaining citizens boarded a special train for the west, consisting of an engine, a flat car and a box car.  All the rest of the engines and cars had been sent east as far as the track remained, and abandoned.<br>
<br>
We succeeded in breaking through the first fire wave, but we could not get through the second and we were caught between the two fires.  The scenes of the fires, the dense, stifling smoke, the intense, blinding beat and the roaring and crackling of the flames were indescribable.<br>
<br>
The flames seem to be over a mile and a half high.  We traveled back and forth attempting to get through at one end or another, but it was impossible.  Progress was constantly impeded by land
slides or rocks, burned logs, etc.  One fireman was killed while picking rocks off the track.  His body was sent to St. Joe as soon as traffic was opened.  One fire s'oened t(' be on one side of the river and the other on the other, and the distance of clear track between them was about 20 miles.<br>
<br>
During the night the wind died down, it grew cold and the fires abated somewhat.  The first fire had not actually reached Avery and it was then apparent that it would not reach town until next day, as these fires travel very slowly at night.  Mr. Debitt and a few who bad gone to the river, assisted by some who bad broken through the fires from the hills, then started a back fire about midnight.<br>
<br>
This back fire burned one house, a $10,000 summer residence in the canyon across the river.  We remained about two miles west of Avery, and about 5:30 a.m. were able to get through.<br>
<br>
As it was seen that there was no escape through both the fires, preparations were made for a last stand at Avery.  As day came on, the wind came up and the fires again started full blast.  Mr. Debitt and a party bad gone to Kyle" on an inspection trip and were cut off there all day, although we were in communication all the time by telephone.<br>
<br>
Pools were dug and filled with water and barrels were filled and placed near buildings.  All water carts were filled and men were placed all over the buildings to guard against sparks.  Bucket brigades were organized.  Early in the morning all empty cars in the vicinity of the back fires were brought in sc, that the yards were also full of rolling stock which it was necessary to guard.<br>
<br>
The second fire appeared to make tremendous progress and about 3:00 p.m. both fires seemed to unite as they struck the back fire.  About the same time the wind suddenly died out, and if it bad not died out about that time, and if there had been no back fire, nothing could bave saved the town or people.  The flames sank rapidly and in about an bour it was evident that the danger was over and all that remained to do was to  watch  the  fires  which  were burning out.<br>
<br>
The universal rejoicing can be imagined although everybody was practically exhausted.<br>
<br>
The dispatch wires had gone down and had been repaired at various times during the last three days and about 5:30 p.m. they were up again.  We then received word that the first relief train was on the way with provisions and supplies.  Captain George J. Holden, 25th Infantry, arrived on this train about 6:30 p.m. and assumed command of the U.S. troops.<br>

Major E. A... Dean, M. C., and four hospital corps men arrived next morning.  Forty-five dead men were found and buried in the vicinity....<br>
<br>
In regard to the extent of loss, it is impossible <B>to </B>estimate same.  Millions of dollars worth of timber must have been destroyed.  District Forester W. B. Greeley told me that the market -value of the timber on the Coeur d'Alene Forest reservation alone was one billion dollars, and I believe this nearly all burned.  The railroad bridges and tunnels destroyed were certainly of great value and nearly all the towns between St. Joe and Grand Forks were burned except Avery.<br>
<br>
Regarding the cause of the fires within my observation, the fires were well started before I arrived.  These fires spread so rapidly that the least little blaze is liable to cause a serious fire. All who have experience and observation seein<br>
<br>
;tl4reed that adequate trails and road for patrolling  and  means of communication by telephone, wireless or otherwise, backed up by a sufficient number of forest guards and rangers ought to prevent any serious fires.  A fire if reached at the start, is easily controlled and extinguished....<br>

COEUR d'ALENE FOREST FIRE Of 1910<br>
<br>
"Coeur d'Alene Forest Fire of 1910," <B>Idaho Historical Society, 18th Biennial Report.</B> Boise: Idaho Historical Society, 1942, p. 25-34.<br>
<br>
No rain had fallen since April, and now it was mid August.  Forest rangers trudged their rounds, watching every little puff of smoke and shuddering whenever the wind quickened a bit.<br>
<br>
Weary men had fought to extinguish fires all over the Coeur d'Alene National Forest for many days.  Fire fighting labor
shortage became acute, and President Taft authorized the use of soldiers.  It did look in August as if the worst might be over.<br>
<br>
True, the treacherous little tongues of flame were still creeping here and there through the brush and rubbish on the forest floor, and these had to be watched and stamped out as fast as possible.  But the rangers and fire wardens thought the rains couldn't be far off, though they'd been so long delayed.<br>
<br>
Then it came about noon on August 20, 1910.  The wind freshened, became a gale, and in the words of W. G. Weigle, Supervisor of the Coeur d'Alene Forest, "assumed hurricane proportions." All over the St. Joe and Coeur d'Alene forests smoldering snags and rubbish heaps quickened to new life.  Sparks were whirled in the dry needles of the tree tops, and a crown fire began to sweep for miles through the dense stands of timber along the St. Joe River.  No human power could stop, or even check, this onslaught.  The only thing for the dazed, defeated and exhausted fire fighters was to get to safety.<br>
<br>
Flames leaped a hundred feet in air, while the column of blood red sparks and smoke climbed even higher.  Literally nothing could live before that fiery blast.  Two days later when the district paused to count the losses, it found at least eighty known dead, seventy-seven of whom were fire fighters, hundreds badly injured, and property damage conservatively estimated at $695,000,000. in addition, probably no one will ever know how many obscure homesteaders and squatters may have been caught in that awful furnace.<br>
<br>
At the height of its fury the holocaust swept over the divide between the Coeur d'Alene and St. Joe rivers and devoured a third of the city of Wallace which lay in its path.  Rescue trains, provided by two railroads serving the city, moved out hundreds of the population, mostly women and children.  The city suffered the loss of but two lives.<br>
<br>
It was a night of terror for those who remained, but the real tragedy of the conflagration did not appear until the next day, when men, who for weeks had been fighting the fire back in the hills, under the direction of the Forest Service were brought into Wallace.  The fact that any of them escaped to tell the story was little short of the miraculous.<br>
<br>
All during the day they were brought in from all directions, some dead, some suffering intense agony and all were blackened, burned and bruised.  Their clothing was in shreds and their appearance was that of men who had literally passed through  the jaws of death.<br>
<br>
As is so often the case in the presence of overwhelming disaster, when the lives of men are placed in jeopardy and death seems the certain fate of all, some man with a cool head and iron nerves
comes to the rescue.  Such a man was Forest Ranger E. C. Pulaski.<br>
<br>
In Supervisor W. G. Weigle's Report, dated June 24, 191 1, he states:<br>
<br>
"Mr.  E. C. Pulaski, who is about forty years of age, is a man of most excellent judgment, conservative, thoroughly acquainted with the region, having prospected throughout the burned area during the last twenty-five years, and is considered by the old timers in the region as one of the best and safest men that could have been placed in charge of men in the hills.<br>
<br>
"Mr. Pulaski was in charge of about one hundred fifty men distributed over a distance of several miles along the divide between the Big Creek of the Coeur d'Alene River and Big Creek of the St. Joe River.  When the danger conditions became imminent he rounded up about forty of his men who were in the danger zone and cut off from safety on the west side of the fire, where the other men were located, and started with them down the mountain toward<br>
Wallace, a distance of ten miles.<br>
<br>
"When about half way, he found that he was cut off by new fires.  At the sight of this his men became panic stricken but he assured them he would still get them to a place of safety."<br>
<br>
And here we produce Mrs. Pulaski's transcription of her husband's first hand account, given as he lay on a bed in a Wallace hospital, not knowing whether he was permanently blinded.<br>
<br>
MR. PULASKI'S STATEMENT<br>
<br>
"During the summer of 1910 forest fires were everywhere in the Coeur d'Alene mountains of Northern Idaho.<br>
<br>
"For weeks there had been no rain and the woods were drier than I had ever seen them.  The intense heat of the sun combined with strong winds which sprang up during the day seemed to scatter the fire in all directions.<br>
<br>
"Crews of several hundred men were working twenty@our hours a day throughout the mountains, endeavoring to hold back the fires.<br>
<br>
"The Supervisor of the Coeur d'Alene National Forest whose headquarters were in Wallace, Idaho, had detailed me to go from one fire camp to another to direct the men in the battle against the flames, and to see that the packers properly distributed supplies.  Although we worked day and night and did everything that could be done to control the fires, little headway was made because of the dryness of the forest and strong winds.<br>
<br>
"On August 20, a terrific hurricane broke over the mountains.  It picked up the fires and carried them for miles, the wind was so strong it almost lifted men out of their saddles, and the canyons seemed to act as chimneys, through which the wind and fires swept
with the roar of a thousand freight trains.<br>
<br>
"The smoke and heat became so intense that it was difficult to breathe.  The men who were packing in supplies refused to go through to their destination, dumped their loads and fled back to Wallace.  Thousands of dollars worth of blankets and supplies were thus lost.<br>
<br>
"That afternoon the wind swept the mountains in circles and joined the fires.  The whole world seemed to us men back in those mountains to be aflame.  Many thought it really was the end of the world.  Under such conditions it would have been worse than fool hardy to attempt to fight the fire.<br>
<br>
"It was a case of saving our lives.  I got on my horse and went where I could, gathering my men.  Most of them were unfamiliar with the country, and I knew that if they ever got out they would have to be led out, but those that I got together were so panic-stricken it was very difficult to make them understand what I wanted them to do.  Added to that it had become very dark, although it was little after mid-day.<br>
<br>
"I finally collected forty-five men.  My voice was almost gone from trying to call above the noise of the fire and wind, but I finally succeeded in making them understand that if they seize blankets from the camp stocks and do just as I told them, there was a chance of saving our lives; otherwise they would be burned to death.<br>
<br>
"Trees were falling all about us under the strain of the fires and heavy winds, and it was almost impossible.to see through the smoky darkness.  Had it not been for my familiarity with the mountain trails, we would never have come out alive, for we were completely surrounded by raging, whipping fires.<br>
<br>
"My one hope was to reach an old mine tunnel which I knew to be not far from us.  We raced for it.  On the way one man was killed by a falling tree.<br>
<br>
"We reached the mine just in time, for we were hardly in when the fire swept over our trail.  I ordered the men to lie face down upon the ground of the tunnel and not dare to sit up, unless they wanted to suffocate, for the tunnel was filling with fire-gas and smoke.  One man tried to make a rush outside, which would have meant certain death.  I drew my revolver and said, "The first man who tries to leave this tunnel, I will shoot." I did not have to use my gun.<br>
<br>
"Two horses were in the tunnel with us.  The horse was riding I had given to an old man who could not keep up with us in the race to the tunnel.  I often wondered what happened to the bear that came down that fiery trail with us and insisted on getting in our way, but at the time I gave no thought to bear or horses.  Outside the tunnel, the canyon was a raging furnace.
"The mine timbers caught on fire so I stood at the entrance and hung wet blankets over the opening, trying to keep the flames back by filling my hat with water, which fortunately was in the mine, and throwing it on the burning timbers.<br>
<br>
"The men were in a panic of fear, some crying, some <B>praying</B>.  Many of them soon became unconscious from the terrible heat, smoke and fire gas.  The wet blankets actually caught fire and I had to replace them with others soaked in water.<br>
<br>
"But I too finally sank down unconscious.  I do not know how long I was in this condition, but it must have been for hours.  I remember hearing a man say, "Come outside boys, the boss is dead," I replied, "Like hell he is." I raised myself up and felt fresh air circulating through the mine.  The men were all becoming conscious.  It was five o'clock in the morning.<br>
<br>
"We tried to stand up but our legs refused to hold us.  So we dragged ourselves to the creek to ease our parched throats and lips.  Our disappointment was terrible when we found the stream filled with ashes and the water too hot to drink.  We counted our number.  Five were missing.  Some of the men went hack and tried to waken them, but they were dead.<br>
<br>
"As the air outside became clearer we gained strength, and finally were able to stagger to our feet and start toward Wallace.  We had to make our way over burning logs and through smoking debris.  When walking failed us we crawled on our hands and knees.<br>
<br>
"How we got down I hardly know.  We were in a terrible condition, all of us hurt or burned.  I was blind and my hands were burned, trying to keep the fire out of the tunnel.  Our shoes were burned off our feet and our clothing was in parched rags.  We were covered with mud and ashes.<br>
<br>
"Some time during the morning a rescue party met us.  These men had had a hard time themselves and were in a very poor condition to help us.<br>
<br>
"Later as we dragged our way down through Placer Creek, we were met by some women from Wallace.  They had got coffee and whiskey and although we appreciated the kindness of those brave women we could take nothing but cold water.<br>
<br>
We finally reached Wallace and were put in different hospitals.  Those who had died, later were brought out on pack horses.  Part of Wallace had burned in that same fire, so when my injuries were dressed I insisted upon going to my home to make sure that my wife and little daughter were all right.  I got a man to lead me, for the world was black to my eyes, but when I found my home and family safe they sent me back to the hospital where I stayed for two months with blindness and pneumonia.
"My experience left me with poor eyes, weak lungs and throat but thank God I am not blind."<br>
<br>
Note: (Mr Pulaski recovered from his harrowing experience and continued his work until 1930 when he was retired after twenty-four years of continuous service.  He died February 2, 1931 at his home in Coeur d'Alene, at the age of sixty-five.)<br>
<br>
The following excerpts in reference to other Rangers and Assistants who, at the same time though in different areas were in charge of their several crews when overtaken by this fire, are taken from the report of Forest Supervisor Weigle, herein before mentioned, a copy of which is on file in the State Historical Society:<br>
<br>
"Mr.  William H. Rock, Assistant Forest Ranger, is a man about twenty-five years of age, having served two years in the region in which he was fighting fire-therefore he was thoroughly acquainted with the details of the region where his men were working.  He had a crew of approximately seventy men about six miles northeast of Avery, Idaho.<br>
<br>
"When the terrific wind storm arose and the fires started up in many places he found he was cut off from getting his men out to Avery.  Therefore, he led them to an area that he had burned over the day before.  As evening drew on the fires were burning up so terrifically that huge columns of smoke which contained quantities of combustible material would frequently burst into flames that would shoot into the sky for thousands of feet."<br>
<br>
"Mr.  H.  M.   Debitt,   Assistant   Forest   Ranger,   is   about<br>
thirty-five years of age.  He was in charge of the district during<br>
the last four years, having headquarters within six miles of where the men perished; therefore, was thoroughly acquainted with all the conditions which might have led to the protection of the men.<br>
<br>
"Owing to the fact that he had general charge of the district he was away from the men when they perished, but, a few hours preceding this, seeing that danger was imminent, he sent Charles Sullivan, who was then serving as Deputy Sheriff at Avery, telling them to come out to Avery immediately as there was danger of being hemmed in by the fire.  All of these men came out with the exception of twenty-eight who thought there was no danger and refused to come."<br>
<br>
"Mr.  L. A. Hollingshead, Forest Guard, is about twenty two years of age.. Although a young man, he has always exercised good judgment.  He is conservative and had served as Forest Guard in the immediate region in which he had charge of men for two years, therefore, was thoroughly familiar with the country.  He had charge of a crew on the West Fork of Big Creek fighting a fire that was coming northeast from Trout Creek.  He had a crew of about sixty men.<br>

"When the terrific winds scattered the fires all over the region and they discovered that they were surrounded by fire, all of his men, with the exception of nineteen worked through the fire line to a place of safety on an area that had previously burned over.<br>
<br>
"Nineteen of these men, being thoroughly panic-stricken, rushed down the hill ahead of the fire to a little cabin where five pack horses were stationed.  They found that the fire was all around them.  They went into the cabin and remained there until the roof began falling in.<br>
<br>
"They rushed out of this and tried to break through the fire line, but the fire was so terrific that eighteen out of the nineteen perished in the flames within a few feet of the cabin.  The nineteenth man accidently worked his way through the fire line and came out to the St. Joe River two days later with all of the skin off his face and hands and his clothing practically burned from his body.<br>
<br>
"After six weeks in the hospital this man fully recovered.  Mr. Hollingshead the next day went into the place where these men perished  and found eighteen men, five horses and a large black bear that had perished in the flames all at the same place."<br>
<br>
"James Danielson, Forest Guard, is a young man about twenty-two years old.  Although young he was thoroughly acquainted with woods work and had been over the region many times where his crew was located. . . . When he found he was surrounded by fire he took his men to an open park near the timber line which contained a light covering of bear grass.<br>
<br>
"They burned off a large area in this park, thinking that by so doing they would have absolute protection of the very best kind.  When the terrific fires, however, approached this area, instead of stopping when the burned area was reached, as would be expected, they continued to burn over the same area the second time.  The men in Danielson's charge had their blankets with them which served as their only protection.  They held those blankets over their heads until the flames had practically consumed them.  One of the men, however, by accident inhaled the flames and perished on the spot.  The other men were very badly burned about the face and hands."<br>
<br>
"S.  M. Taylor is a man of about forty years of age and a conservative, intelligent fellow, thoroughly able to handle<br>
men, and a prospector in this region for many years.  He had charge of the Bullion fire along the Montana-Idaho line east of Wallace.  When Mr. Taylor discovered that he was surrounded by fires he took his crew, consisting of about sixty men, to the tunnel of the Bullion Mine, which seemed to Mr. Taylor to offer absolute protection.<br>
<br>
One of the men, Mr. Ryson, who was with the crew, knew the tunnel thoroughly, owing to the fact that he had made it.  Most of the crew who went into the tunnel passed an overhead air shaft.  Eight of the
men, however, did not do this and the smoke rushed in to where these men were located and suffocated them.  The remaining crew came out a few hours afterward without any injury.<br>
<br>
Another record of human interest is a letter written by Wm. Chance of Cathedral City, California, April 8, 1938, to the successor of Supervisor Weigle. Mr. Chance was a member of the crew whom Ranger Pulaski rescued.  Those portions which parallel the Pulaski account are not reproduced, but another section reads as follows:<br>
<br>
"We retreated over McFee's Trail to McFee's Cabin.  When we arrived the people who occupied the cabin had dug a hole in the ground to bury their supplies; they jumped in when the fire hit, and, I believe roasted; our crew remained in the creek.  Ranger Pulaski returned and found us at this point."<br>
<br>
While these scenes were being enacted in the woods, the city of Wallace had gone through its no less awful experiences. Stanley Koch describes the day of  August  20,  in an article in the American Forester, reproduced in the  July 1942 Reader's Digest.<br>
<br>
People living in southern Idaho,  several  hundred  miles<br>
from the fire, remember distinctly the dense clouds of  smoke which billowed over the southern Idaho sky;  also  the  hasty<br>
mobilization  of  the  Idaho  National  Guard  for  emergency<br>
service.<br>

TILLAMOOK FIRE.<br>
<br>
Stewart Holbrook, "The Tillamook Fire," <B>The Columbia.</B> New York: Rinehart and Company, Inc., 1956, p. 222-224.<br>
<br>
The worst scars of the fires of 1902 are still to be seen on the Yacolt Burn.  The fires prompted Washington to provide for a state forester and a chief fire warden.  Oregon acted to create a board of forestry.  These modest steps did little toward preventing fires or controlling them.  That had to wait for <B>1910 </B>when a bigger and deadlier fire aroused national interest.<br>
<br>
This, too, was really a series of fires that started burning in May and continued into September.  They were virtually all on Columbia waters in the pine regions of Montana, Idaho, Washington and British Columbia.  Ten thousand men fought them-loggers, miners, ranchers, rangers, and soldiers.  The dead totaled eighty five.  The burn covered more than three million acres.<br>
<br>
The total timber damage probably topped eight billion feet, but this
is at best a guess, for the area contained widely varying stands.  All of the lives were lost and much of the damage done on the two terrifying days of August 20th and <B>21st.<br>
</B><br>
<br>
An awakened public at last demanded something be done, and in <B>1911 </B>Congress passed the Weeks Act which provided Federal aid to state and private forest owners in maintaining protective organizations.  It was a notable effort and its effect has been encouraging, even though more than two decades later Oregon had a fire more destructive of timber than anything before.<br>
<br>
This was the Tillamook fire which began early in the afternoon of August 14, 1933, and in ten days covered 311,000 acres in Northwest Oregon.  I saw it burn and shall never forget it.  The area was relatively small compared to the fires of <B>1902 </B>and <B>1910, </B>yet it was all old growth timber and twelve and one-half billion feet of it was devastated.<br>
<br>
Salvage began promptly and it is still being done more than two decades after the land stopped smoking.  Reseeding and replanting as well as other reforestation measures have been almost continuously under way by the State of Oregon.  The direct loss from the fire was staggering.  Much greater was the loss in future forests.<br>
<br>
Men have attempted to figure this loss of productive growth and have come up with sets of figures labeled "board feet" and "dollars," but the whole matter obviously belongs in the realm of metaphysics- It is not to be computed by any known method of mathematics.<br>
<br>
One striking fact about the Tillamook fire has been reserved to give it the accent of isolation: Of the 311,000 acres burned, approximately 270,000 acres were burned during less than twenty hours on August 24th and 25th.<br>
<br>
This will give an idea of the speed with which fire can travel, once weather conditions are ripe in the commonly damp climate of western Oregon, the section responsible for the nickname, the Webfoot State.<br>

FOREST FIRE OF 1910.<br>
<br>
Ivan Doig, "When the Bitterroots burned," <B>Pacific Search.</B> IX (September, 1975), p. 9-11.<br>
<br>
The smoke smeared the sky all the way across the continent.  A NEW YORK TIMES story out of Boston reported that the sky had been so
clotted with murk the evening before that "it had the appearance of storm clouds.  Today the murky conditions continued; the sun unable to penetrate the haze, resembling a copper ball......<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, more than 2000 miles to the west at the source of the smoke, battalions of men were trickling out of the valleys and gulches along an incredible arc of blackened landscape.  Besides their bums and injuries, they brought out with them episodes of bravery and horror.  What they would tell and retell, and what<br>
we know in stark statistics, comprise the story of the Northwest's greatest forest fire.<br>
<br>
The dry spring and summer of 1910 came as a surprise.  Winter snows had piled to epic depths in many mountain ranges.  In the North Cascades, February ended with record storms and the enormous avalanche which swept over two Great Northern trains at the Wellington siding and killed at least 96 persons ("When Death Wore White At Wellington"' PACIFIC SEARCH, April, 1975).<br>
<br>
In the upper St. Regis valley of western Montana, foresters in April reported a snowpack of four to six feet, still so hard they could <B>walk </B>on it without snowshoes.  But spring rains failed to follow the snow, and the Northwest began drying like a sponge in the sun.  By July, crops had withered.  Hot southwest winds swept across the Columbia River country, and on into the mountain ranges of Idaho and Montana.<br>
<br>
The U.S. Forest Service began fighting constant fires in those mountains as early as June that year.  A quilt work of national forests from eastern Washington across Idaho and Montana to the northwestern corner of South Dakota was administered as District One (now called Region One), with headquarters at Missoula.  The man in charge was one of those rockets sometimes seen <B>blazing </B>a career up through the bureaucracy.<br>
<br>
District Forester William B. Greeley was 31 years old, a scant six years out of the forestry school at Yale.  His dean at Yale, Henry Graves, had called him "a special star." Now Graves himself had become head of the U.S. Forest Service, and Greeley was his heir apparent.  From his office at Missoula, Greeley held command over some 40 million acres, a realm of timber about the size of the entire state of Washington.<br>
<br>
Through the early summer of 1910, he had to put crews out into that forested acreage to battle blazes which first flared up into the dozens, and then into hundreds.<br>
<br>
The Forest Service records for 1910 say that more than 1700 fires were fought in District One.  Such warfare was new at the time.  The national forest system had been revised and expanded to its modem dimensions only five years before.  In the years since, the fire seasons had not been intense in District One.  No reserves of equipment were on hand, and crews bound for the fire lines were
outfitted with gear bought at local hardware stores.<br>
<br>
Manpower mostly came from anywhere it could be found - railroad workers pressed into service, floaters from the streets of Spokane and Missoula, some savvy small-towners who had worked at mining and lumbering the mountain country.  By the middle of July, 1910, more than 3000 men were in these makeshift fire crews.<br>
<br>
During the next three weeks, the crews seemed to have brought District One's epidemic of fires under control.  The supervisor of the hard-hit Lolo National Forest said on August 9th that all fires in the Lolo either were nearly under control or had been put out entirely.!He spoke a day too soon.  On the 10th--,--'dry winds fanned the dying fires into a line of blaze along the Bitterroot Range, the spine of forested peaks canted southeastward along the Montana-Idaho border.<br>
<br>
This "blow-up," as the foresters called it, greatly extended the fire lines.  For nine days afterward, the fire fighters seemed to be gaining control again.  But early on the 20th of August, a vaster "blow-up" began.  One forest ranger remembered that the tremendous wind which began blowing "almost lifted men out of their saddles." This time, the flames began a surge which the fire crews could not even make a pretense of stopping.  Fire flared in the timber along a front from near the Canadian border down the length of the Idaho panhandle to the Salmon River country, an axis of about 160 miles.<br>
<br>
The Bitterroot Range was now virtually erupting into fire.  This was more than crown fire, worse than holocaust.  Out of the hellish lessons of Hiroshima and the incendiary bombing of Dresden and Hamburg, we recognize now the phenomenon that was happening in those hot days of late August as the fire fed its own fury: a fire storm.<br>
<br>
And as the mountains flamed, fire crews began to cope or die.<br>
-Near Setzer Creek in the St. Joe Mountains, southward from where Interstate 90 now passes through the town of Mullan, Idaho, a crew of about 70 men were cut off.  They managed to retreat safely into an already-burned area.<br>
<br>
With nightfall came a cataclysmic scene later described in the report of the supervisor of the Coeur d'Alene National Forest: "...the fires were burning up so terrifically that huge columns of smoke which contained large quantities of combustible materials would frequently burst into flames that would shoot into the sky for thousands of feet." It reads like a spectacle of biblical awe-
someness - "the pillar of fire by night."<br>
<br>
The fiery night was too much for one of the crew members.  He walked off alone along the ridge above Setzer Creek and killed himself with two gunshots.<br>
<br>
On Moose Creek in the Clearwater National Forest, southwest across the Idaho line from Missoula, Deputy Supervisor Ed Thenon led in a
crew of about 30 fire fighters.  The men bedded down for the night.  Not long after ten o'clock, Thenon later wrote, one of the crew called him from his tent: "Come out here, I just saw a star fall on the hillside across the creek and it has started a fire."<br>
<br>
Thenon looked across the creek to the small fire burning up in the dark timber.  Turning west into the teeth of the wind, he saw where the "star" had wafted from: the skyline was glowing pink " across a width of several miles."<br>
<br>
Thenon rousted out his men and hurried to see if the nearby creek might save them.  Already the flames were casting shadows through the camp.  He found Moose Creek to be "six to eight inches deep and about eight feet across with a strip of sand six feet wide which had been strewn along its edge by a sharp turn in the creek."<br>
<br>
Thenon got the men to moving their equipment onto the sandbar, then turned to a large pile of driftwood at one end of the sand.  He decided it could be damped down to keep from burning when the crown fire roared over them.  Then, with all the men in the creek, and the fire blasting through the camp, Thenon relates:<br>
<br>
"I was throwing a bucket of water on the grub pile when I heard a commotion among the men and left my work to see what it was about.  We had all rolled in the creek several times before this to keep our clothes soaked.  I found that two of the men had completely lost their minds.<br>
<br>
"One of them had become violently insane and three men were trying to hold him and to lay him down in the creek.  The other one was dancing around and singing a lullaby."<br>
<br>
Somehow Thenon and the crew's cooler heads kept control.  "I set the lullaby boy down in the deepest water," Thenon recalled, "and told him to stay there and threw a wet blanket over his head." Then the busy crew leader remembered the grub pile he had been damping down, whirled, and found it ablaze.  As Thenon threw a bucket of water, the crown fire passed overhead and slammed the breath out of him.<br>
<br>
"I swayed around a step or two with the empty bucket still in my hand and dropped to my knees.... For no particular reason I stuck my head into the bucket.  This proved a blessing as I was able to draw a breath instantly and was relieved of the terrible strain.  I got to my feet and with two or three steps I was in the creek where I lay down with the bucket still over my head."<br>
<br>
Before long, the wind shifted and the intense heat cased.  Every one of Thenon's men had survived.  Through it all, the "lullaby boy" had continued to sing, lapsing towards sanity every so often to ask someone to throw another bucket of water on him.<br>
<br>

Along the West Fork of Big Creek, in the Coeur d'Alene National Forest, a crew of 60 men found fire on all sides of them as the wind seared into their area.  All but 19 of them worked their way through a line of fire into a burnt area, where they were safe.  The 19 ran in panic ahead of the fire until they came to a cabin where five pack horses were tied.  The men blindly crammed into the little building.<br>
<br>
When fire took the roof, they tried to escape to the outside again.  One man made it and staggered through to safety with the skin burned from his face and hands.  Within a few feet of the cabin site were found, as the forest supervisor's report put it, the chaffed corpses of "eighteen men, five horses and a large black bear."<br>
<br>
Along a divide between the watersheds of the Coeur d'Alene River and the St. Joe River occurred the most famous piece of heroism during the great fire.  Ranger Ed Pulaski, who had prospected in the region before joining the Forest Service, was in charge of about 150 men on a fire line.  When the flames shifted, Pulaski and about 40 of his men were cut off.  The ranger began leading the group to the town of Wallace, ten miles away through the St. Joe Mountains.<br>
<br>
After several miles, new flames again cut off the men.<br>
From his prospecting days, Pulaski knew of a pair of tunnels at the War Eagle mine, and hurried his men toward them.  With a wet gunny sack protecting his head, the ranger fought through the smoke until he found a tunnel, and returned to lead his crew to the tunnel mouth just before the fire swept through.<br>
<br>
Into the tunnel went 42 men and two horses.  A rivulet of drain water trickled along the floor of the shaft, and Pulaski got the men to lie flat with their faces on the damp earth.  But then panic, which made so many deadly swipes into the Bitterroot fire crews, threatened Pulaski's men.  As Pulaski told it later:<br>
"One man tried to make a rush outside, which would have meant certain death.  I drew my revolver and said: "The first man who tries to leave this tunnel, I will shoot."'<br>
<br>
The men clung to the damp floor again.  By now the heat outside was so extreme the timbers of the mine shaft flared into flame.  Pulaski frantically dipped water from the trickle of water with his hat and hurled it on the timbers.  He stood and fought flames until he passed out.<br>
<br>
Pulaski came to hours later to hear a voice saying, "Come outside, boys, the boss is dead." Pulaski feebly retorted: "Like heck he is." The crew dragged itself from the tunnel, and found the creek outside too hot and ashy to drink from.  But with the fire gone past, fresh air now revived them.  Five had died in the tunnel.<br>
<br>
The surviving three dozen staggered off toward the town of Wallace, crawling when they couldn't walk, terribly burned and smoke-choked, Pulaski temporarily blind.  Eventually they met a rescue party, and lurched out to Wallace and the safety of hospital beds.
The hurricane of fire went through the Bitterroots throughout the 20th and 21st of August.  Flames swept toward the town of Wallace from the west, made an inexplicable leap, and burned out the east end of town.  At last, early on the morning of the 22nd, the wind dropped and humidity increased.  The fires slowed.<br>
<br>
They, had been dampered for good; a rain beginning on the night of August 31 finally ended the 1910 fire season.<br>
<br>
The toll is accounted in such figures as these: at least 85 persons killed, 78 of them fire fighters; seven to eight billion board feet of merchantable timber destroyed, much of it valuable white pine.<br>
All in all, the Bitterroot fire raged across more than three million acres.<br>
<br>
The dimensions of such a charred slash are comparable to the freeway distance between Portland and Seattle, with the pattern of black burn reaching out 15 miles on each side of the road.  And all along the route, every second mile there would be the body of someone who had died in the Northwest's greatest <B>forest</B> fire.<br>

THE GREAT FIRE OF 1910.<br>
<br>
Orland A. Scott, "The Great Fire of 1910," <B>Pioneer Days on the Shadowy St. Joe.</B> Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, 1968, p. 359-365.<br>
<br>
Through the months of May, June, July, and into August, little rain had fallen on the immensely rich timberlands of the St. Joe and Coeur d'Alene rivers.  July and August suns were blistering hot.  Homesteaders and prospectors followed the dusty trails into the dense shade of pine, spruce, fir, and cedar, grateful for the momentary coolness afforded.<br>
<br>
Creeks were running low on water and springs that, in the memory of white man and Indian, had never failed, dried up.  The moss-laden, pine-needle-covered floor of the forest was tinder-dry and crackled under foot.  There was a burning dryness in the air.<br>
<br>
By August 1 the deep banks of snow on the north and east sides of the high peaks and ridges leading from the tops of Round Top, Baldy, and Cataldo Peak, and other high points in the St. Joe-Coeur d'Alene water-shed had melted into thin trickles of water flowing down the thirsty creeks.  Huckleberry brush, drawing moisture from the wet soil where the white, hardpacked banks once lay, made a green carpet on the steep slopes.  
The usually creamy-white of the bear-grass bloom, of the high-mountain glades, came out a sickly yellow in the scalding sun.  Evergreen tips oozed a pitchy sap and the scent of the forest was raw turpentine.  In instinctive dread animals and birds found refuge along the beds of drying streams and in brush-lined meadowlands near the rivers.<br>
<br>
Bear took to the sloughs and mud-holes at low elevations.  Deserted were the haunts of higher elevations.  No Indian hunting or berry-picking parties moved on the familiar trails.  Everywhere the heat was intense and stifling.  The dim outlines of well-known mountains were visible only through the barrier of a semi-translucent summer haze.  The entire countryside was hot and dry, unconsciously awaiting the fateful day.<br>
<br>
On the morning of August 24, 1910, there seemed no movement of air anywhere in the still sparsely-settled and lovely valley of the St. Joe.<br>
<br>
The river itself was still as death-the surface calm above deep pools of peace.  Trout basked lazily under overhanging branches, or behind shelving banks, undercut by the ebb and flow of the river, or turbulent waves of fast-running steamers.  All along the river the hay crops were harvested, but fall plowing and seeding had not yet started.<br>
<br>
Valley industry was at a standstill, except in a few lumber-camps in the upper valleys of the St. Joe and St. Maries, where the big companies were crowding the men for more logs to feed their mill plants.  Regular passenger and freight steamers continued their trips up and down stream, the heat-burdened deck-hands stripping to the waist and working at night to unload their cargoes.  But over the valley hung an air of unconscious foreboding, as of unvoiced fear and anxiety.<br>
<br>
Mid-afternoon.  From the town of St. Maries we could see a pinnacle of smoke rising like the claws of a tiger over the trees of Cherry Creek and the high ridge of Benewah.  There began a menacing movement of air from the southwest heading toward St. Maries.  As minutes passed, the smoke-cloud grew, billowing in sullen blackness as it extended farther along the ridge and higher above the horizon.<br>
Somewhere on Benewah Creek, no one knew where, or how, a fire had started, and with explosive fury sent its black, hot smoke rolling upward and eastward toward the little town.<br>
<br>
Dust from farther west met smoke in a seething heatmass, scattering -firebrands high in the air and over the surrounding terrain.  Gathering in volume, it jumped from tree-top to tree-top, and from ridge to ridge, in a withering attack upon every living thing.  As darkness settled early over the valley, the heat grew in intensity.  An alarm was sounded-a fire-fighting crew was quickly assembled-before nightfall five hundred men were
on a line encircling the town on the west and south.<br>
<br>
Billy Ross, veteran forester, was in charge, and kept the men at work all that first night.  By the next morning another five-hundred men were brought down from the lumber-camps on the St. Maries River over the Chicago, Milwaukee Railroad branch line.  With picks, shovels, axes, plows, and horses, the crew opened a pathway through the thick timber back of the town, and began set-
ting backfires to head off the advancing flames from the Benewah and Cherry Creek side.<br>
<br>
Ross was confident he could, with the help of his fire-fighting crew, stop the fire and save the town.  By noon of the second day the fire was under control and the town saved.  The all-out attempt by Ross and his crew had succeeded and a grateful people did not forget them.  A thousand men were engaged.<br>
<br>
Frightened people moved many of their valuables out of their homes down to the riverbank below town.  Some set up temporary quarters in tents and took their families to the riverside for safety.  Silver and other prized possessions were buried in yards in town, or basement cellars, for preservation.  Bedding and cooking utensils were moved along with other household equipment.<br>
<br>
Amid falling sparks and shrieking tree-tops in a wind of flame, the whole world seemed afire that first desperate night.  Mothers held their babies close, muttered lullabies and prayed, while their husbands and sons fought to halt the roaring tide.  Success in their effort to save the town, and the lives and property of its citizens, was attributed to the spirit of cooperation on the part of the people and to wise direction on the part of their leaders in the crisis.<br>
<br>
Simultaneously with the start of the fire on Benewah Creek, another blaze, destined to become much more serious and destructive, exploded into mad fury on the south fork of Hell's Gulch in a splendid body of white-pine timber.  By early evening it had consumed the timbered area north of Sharp Top Mountain and had jumped into the middle and north forks of Hell's Gulch and was racing in wild abandon across ravines, gullies, and ridges, heading toward the crest of the divide into Thomas Creek and the west slopes of Round Top Mountain.<br>
<br>
Thousands of acres of fine timber had been burned in the Hell's Gulch Basin before nightfall, and the fierce wrath of the flames could be seen all night long from the town of St. Maries.  The most spectacular forest fire sight I have ever witnessed was when the fire burst over the Hell's Gulch-Thomas Creek divide.<br>
<br>
It was then that we saw a wall of bright-red flame leap from the west ridge to the east ridge of Thomas Creek, a milewide jump, in a moment of time.  Then the flames sucked down into the depths of the canyon of Thomas Creek and swept upward toward Round Top
Mountain in a seething caldron of falling trees, with soot and smoke and flaming branches soaring high into the air.  Acres of timber went down in a flash and no power on earth could save it.<br>
<br>
This scene was repeated within the space of a half-hour in Streit Creek Canyon and Rochat Creek to the east.  There was no sunset that night only a slow gathering of the darkness and the dull or bright red of burning timber.  By eight o'clock Round Top Mountain was a ball of fire, its whole western and southern exposure, visible from St. Maries, was in flames.<br>
<br>
We could hear the sullen roar of the flames as they changed trees into turpentine torches in a mad frenzy of destruction.  Inhabitants of St. Maries, and farm families along the river, sought rest that night of August 24 in sorrow and dismay.  Their beautiful valley was being ravished by fire.<br>
<br>
Many of the creeks running into the St. Joe River from the north met the main river at nearly right-angles to its westward flow.  These creeks have their rise in the main divide between the St. Joe and Coeur d'Alene rivers and, in general, are relatively short, increasing in length as one travels east toward the head of the river valley.<br>
<br>
Originally timbered with fine stands of red fir, white pine, yellow pine, cedar and hemlock, with an occasional spruce, they afforded an ideal setting for giant suction fires up the draws.  The best white pine stands were found at the heads of the creeks.  The ridges separating these small creeks were sharp, angular, twisting spines with steep slopes and rocky precipices on either side above the stream bed.<br>
<br>
The wind swept up the main valley from the west and south that late afternoon of August 24.  It drove the red-hot flames in searing blasts across the dividing ridges between the creeks, leaping from crest to crest across milewide chasms in walls of flame.<br>
<br>
The generating heat from these ridge fires created vast heat-chimneys with terrific suction from the bottoms of the creeks upward so that roaring furnaces of fire, hot ash, smoke, and exploding fumes from the thousands of burning trees, shrubs, and brush, moved with merciless velocity up the narrow gorges, gen-
erating infernos of heat and suffocation beyond description.<br>
<br>
Few living things could stand in its path.  A few animals, it is true, stricken with terror, leaped into the pools of the little streams to escape with their lives but with hair burned off and feet mere stumps with bones protruding from the seared skin and flesh.<br>
<br>
About four o'clock of that fateful day in August, Emile Montandon
and I, who held adjoining homesteads at the head of the south fork of La Tour Creek on the Coeur d'Alene side of the divide and northeast of the head of Streit Creek, left St. Maries with a light pack on our backs, intending to go into our claims up the Streit Creek trail.<br>
<br>
We took the steamer Defender, which, on account of numerous stops along the river that day, was late getting into St. Maries.  We left the boat at Ducommun's landing and started up the Streit Creek trail, leading to Monarch, Hired Girl, and Big Five mining claims, and to several homesteads enroute.<br>
<br>
Both fast hikers, we expected to reach our claims in about two hours after we hit the trail, if we could get through.  A heavy pall of smoke hung portentously over the entire valley.  Through the semi-gloom we could see bright fire-brands falling through the trees and occasionally feel hot blasts of wind lopping over the ridge to the west.<br>
<br>
We had progressed, probably, about one mile above the upper end of the Streit Creek ranch of Fritz Streit, when we met Mr. and Mrs. Miesen and their young son running at top speed down the trail toward us.  Their faces were blackened with soot and we noted they were carrying light packs and some additional bundles.  Mr. Miesen had a gun.  Their homestead was located on the slopes of Ferguson and Thomas creeks, and the trail leading to it took off at the Monarch Mine tunnel.<br>
<br>
Plainly the Miesens were badly frightened and almost overcome with the heat and smoke.  They reported that a blazing wall of fire had suddenly appeared over the ridge beyond their homestead to the west and that they had only time to grab a few things and run down the trail toward the Monarch, the hot flames licking at their heels.  Behind them they saw their cabin burning and the trees falling like pillars of fire all around them.<br>
<br>
The Miesens advised us not to attempt going any farther up the trail, and urged us to turn back toward the river while the trail that way was still open.  So we took part of their packs and joined them in going down stream toward Streit's.  By the time we reached the Ducommun landing, a half-hour later, we looked back on a terrifying scene.  The entire Streit Creek area was in flames.  We could feel the suction as the fire roared up the little valley, consuming many millions of feet of choice timber.<br>
<br>
All that would be left of Streit Creek in another hour would be a black, six-mile-long gash between two burned ridges, a few big trees still standing but blazing from top to bottom, illuminating the smoldering ruins.  It was a ghastly spectacle.  The homesteaders' cabins and those of the three or four prospecting companies were a total loss.  All the buildings on McCarter Creek, a tributary of Streit Creek, were burned, as were those of the Silver King Mine on the head of Thomas Creek farther west.  
They were wiped out in a matter of moments.  In all directions there was nothing left but the burning stumps of once-beautiful trees; a downed monarch of the forest fallen to the ground fed the fire along its entire length.  There were hot ash-heaps where trees had crisscrossed in falling and met hot destruction to-
gether.<br>
<br>
Appalling desolation everywhere.  Only a short time before there was a living, breathing forest of stately trees, with animal trails and pack-trails lined with green moss, skirting around rock declivities and along gurgling streams where cool freshness invited.<br>
<br>
Rochat Creek, lying east of Streit Creek, was covered with a mixed growth of cedar, fir, tamarack, spruce, hemlock, and white pine.  The cedar grew in the creek bottom while the white pine extended in a fan-like shape near the head of the creek, spreading out wide at the top and dipping down into the small forks of the main creek.<br>
<br>
This white pine timber was choice material, lying on the southern and western slopes of the Coeur d'Alene-St.  Joe divide, some of it as far west as the northwestern slopes of Mt.  Weissner, or old Baldy, as it was known in those early days.<br>
<br>
The great fire came in on the wings of a strong wind, blowing out of the southwest and sweeping up the valley.  It crossed Streit Creek, and hit Rochat Creek like a mad demon about midway between its source and its mouth, burning across and up and down stream in an amazing inferno of heat.  Walls of flames bellowed and roared in the tops of the green timber and intense heat destroyed the last vestige of life in the narrow gorge.<br>
<br>
It swept in hungry hate into the white pine timber at the head of the creek, consuming every acre of it before dawn of the next day, August 25.  Huge columns of flame sucked witheringly up the canyon, leaving nothing but stumps and ashes behind.  Devastation and desolation unlimited.<br>
<br>
Only at odd places a lonely tree had escaped the holocaust, to stand a deserted sentinel in the midst of black despair.  The pitiable land.<br>
<br>
The once-shining creek flowed its hot waters over the heated bare rocks, past fire-scarred hillsides, between desolate canyon walls where no living thing clung.  In terrible irony the water-washed ashes and fire-brands in heaps on the gravel bars covered the halfburned bodies of deer, rabbits, and upland fowl.<br>
<br>
On and on, ever eastward, the fire raged, scorching, searing, devouring, leaving blackness, terror, and destruction in a broad field of death.  The wind held steady from the southwest, driving the flames back from the river toward the divide.<br>
One after another it burned out the narrow valleys of the small streams, frequently breaking over the divide on the Coeur d'Alene and eating its way more slowly into thick timber beyond.  The watercourses, under the effects of the terrific heat, dried up to little but a trickle flowing over heat-scarred rocks.  Invaluable stands of timber were lost in the big blaze.<br>
<br>
Beyond Rochat Creek were Reed Creek, Falls Creek, Trout Creek, Slate Creek, and Big Creek, which held one of the finest stands of virgin white pine timber on the St. Joe.  Eastward of that, to the summit of the Bitterroot branch of the Rockies, was a vast unexplored area of fine timber which the fire entered from several directions, carried by divergent currents of air until it burned itself out or the rains came to drench and kill the flames.<br>
<br>
The most tragic of all events connected with the 1910 fire occur-
red on Big Creek, where a fire-fighting crew under the supervision of the U.S. Forest Service was trapped in a deep canyon, resulting in the death of sixty-five men.  Many of the bodies brought out after the fire were unrecognizable, and some were never identified.  They were buried in a select part of the cemetery at St. Maries, with each grave appropriately marked.<br>

Gordon Newell, "The Great Seattle Fire," <B>Totem Tales  of Old Seattle.</B> Seattle Superior, 1956.<br>
<br>
It hadn't  rained  for  almost  a  month,  which  was   something  to talk about on Puget Sound., May had been mostly dry and so was the first week of June.  The weather was the leading topic of conversation, having taken brief priority over Tacoma's latest act of piracy.<br>
<br>
The hated rival was trying to steal Seattle's mountain, Rainier, and name it after itself! Outrageous, but the sort of thing to be expected and guarded against when one had undesirable neighbors ... and the weather was wonderful.  The weather was wonderful and Seattle was tinder dry.<br>
<br>
The calendar on the wall of McGough's paint store and cabinet shop said June 6, 1889.  The paint store was in the basement of Mrs. Pontius' wooden building at the corner of First and Madison.  Once 
in a while a cable car clanked by outside, but mostly <B>it</B> was just a quiet, drowsy summer afternoon, with fat flies buzzing around the pot of glue the handy man was heating over a gasoline stove. just before three o'clock the handy man succumbed to the general drowsiness of the day and let the glue boil over.<br>
<br>
It caught fire as it dripped onto the turpentine-soaked shavings on the floor.  McGough and the handyman threw a bucket of water on the little fire and it became a big one.  They fled then, and none too soon.  The Pontius Building flared up like a pitchpine torch.<br>
<br>
Seattle had enjoyed the benefits of a volunteer fire department since 1876, although it had gotten off to a bad start.  When the first alarm sounded the whole department arrived on the scene in record time, but they had forgotten to take along the fire engine.<br>
<br>
This problem was solved by the posting of a ten dollar reward for 
the <B>first </B>team hitched to the engine following an alarm.  After that wagons were abandoned aR over town when the bell sounded while teams and drivers raced to Widow Plummer's stable, where the engine was kept.<br>
<br>
The department had improved considerably since those days and there was no delay in responding to the fire in McGough's shop.  The hose cart from Second and Columbia got there first, pulled by a whooping crew of men and boys, but Steam Pumper Number One was a much grander and more reassuring sight when it came roMng in from the main fire station with the big horses' hoofs drumming hard on the dry planked street and the black smoke pouring from the polished brass stack.  
The hose cart had already coupled onto the fire plug at Madison, so the steamer's crew took the next one, two blocks south.  The long dry spell had kept the water level low in the reservoirs.  Two 
feeble streams of water searched for the heart of <B>fire </B>that was hidden in the blinding smoke.  An onlooker observed that if someone would treat him to a couple of short beers he could put on a better demonstration than the fire department.<br>
<br>
Humorous comment ended when the blaze ate through the walls to touch off the high-proof contents of a liquor store in the Denny Block next door.  It spread from there to a row of saloons and in less than twenty minutes the whole block from Madison to Marion was wrapped in fire.<br>
<br>
The firemen concentrated on trying to keep the flames from spreading to the Commercial MilI behind the Denny Block and to the Opera House and Colman Building on opposite comers of Marion and just across the street from the fire.  The fire bell kept on banging away and Steam Pumper Number Two came dashing up to pump salt water from the bay, but the tide was out; the hose wasn't long 
enough to reach the heart of <B>the </B>fire.<br>
<br>
The crews on First and Marion fought the fire to a standsdu for a while, until embers spiralled upward to settle on the Opera House roof.  Inside of seconds the city's proudest building was roofed with solid flame.  Then the whole side of the Colman Building seemed to flare up at once and the Commercial Mill began to burn.  The northeast breeze suddenly became a brisk, deadly wind, and the acting fire chief gave way to mild hysterics.<br>
<br>
Tough, capable young Mayor Robert Moran took command, ordering the Colman Block and other buildings in the path of the fire dynamited.  Tbe flames roared across the wreckage chewing their way south and 
west across the yard to en<B>gulf </B>the waterfront docks.  Within an hour of the glue pot's tipping it was evident that the whole business district was doomed.<br>
<br>
At the courthouse judge Hanford adjoumed the murder trial at which he was presiding.  The same sense of propriety which had led him to close doors neatly under Indian attack had kept the legal mill grinding as long as possible, but, like judge Greene, he wasn't going to carry legality to ridiculous extremes.  Besides, the jury wasn't paying attention to business.  Some of its members suspected that everything they owned was being burned up by the fire or blown up by the firelighters, and they were right.<br>
<br>
Judge Hanford paused at the window to glance at the ugly square bell-tower of Trinity Church silhouetted against the sullen glow of flames.  "If it doesn't burn that down the fire's a total loss", he
observed dryly.  Tben he went outside to see about saving the courthouse.<br>
<br>
Somebody managed to get on the roof and the Judge helped to fill water buckets and hoist them to him by way of the flagpole halliards.  Dozens of small fires were thus doused on the courthouse roof and that important structure was saved, as was Henry Yesler's grand new mansion across the way where the County-City Building now stands.<br>
<br>
The bay stopped the fire on the west after the docks were gone, and it was under control to the east, but there was no stopping its race south to engulf the Lava Bed with its labyrinth of saloons and cheap hotels and fancy bawdy houses on the sawdust flats.  It had taken twenty years to develop the Lava Bed from the humble be-
ginnings of John Pennell's Mad House, but twenty minutes of fire wiped it out, which was the end of the Lava Bed for all time.<br>
<br>
The district itself came back after the fire . . . bigger and gaudier and more sordid than ever . . . but under a new name.  People started calling it the Tenderloin after the Great Fire.<br>
<br>
Seattle, the lusty young boom-town, had been happily engaged in slugging it out with all the other towns of the Northwest for supremacy and had hated them all cordially; Tacoma most of all, naturally.  Seattle, the blasted, burned-out shell of a town found that even ornery neighbors can be mighty comforting to have around when things get really tough.<br>
<br>
The fire hadn't bad much more than an hour's headway when a big red fire engine came rocketing and smoking through town from the waterfront.  People cheered through heat-parched throats when they saw the shining gold letters on its side ... Tacoma Fire Department.<br>
<br>
A little later the fast steamboat Fleetwood came knifing in from Olympia with the foam piled up like surf at her bows and the wood sparks shooting fifty feet in the air from her stack and the capitol city's new steam pumper lashed on the forward deck.'<br>
<br>
Strange fire engines kept coming in all afternoon and evening, from Port Townsend and Snohomish and New Whatcom.  At half past two in the morning the gleaming pumper Multnomah, pride of the Portland Fire Department, came in from Oregon by train, and at four o'clock the side-wheeler T. J. Potter caine in from Canada with an engine manned by the chief and 22 men of the Victoria Fire Department.  Flames were licking at the Canadian Pacific pier and so they stood and fought the fire where they landed.<br>
<br>
The fire burned itself out before dawn.  There wasn't anything left
in the business district or the Lava Bed for it to feed on.  The waterfront was swept clean of docks and mills and coal bunkers from Jackson Street to Union.  Twenty-five blocks, sixty square acres of the little city had been wiped out overnight.  It has been said that the heart of Seattle was destroyed in the Great Fire of 1889, but that's a misstatement.<br>
<br>
Tacoma was busy setting up big tents in which to serve 3000 meals a day and the Mosquito Fleet was coming in the bay from an the towns on Puget Sound bringing food and clothing and medical supplies when the sun came up.  Then there were signs that Seattle's heart was still beating.  Newsboys hit the unburned streets hawking the morning edition of the Post-Intelligencer announcing that there had been a fire.<br>
<br>
The newspaper plant was in ashes, as was that of the Times, but a couple of little job presses had been rescued and they were doing their duty.  Then a red and yellow cable car nosed over the crest of Madison Street and felt its way cautiously downgrade to where the tracks were warped by the heat of the fire.<br>
<br>
Word was passed that a meeting was being called to discuss the rebuilding of the town.  It was to be beld in the armory, which was the biggest building to escape the fire, and the public was invited.  Clearly, Seattle, however singed and shocked, was still a city with a healthy pulse-beat.<br>
<br>
Historians have made much of an intangible force called "the Seattle Spirit", although none of them have explained just what it is - or was.  Popular opinion seems to hold that it's the frame of mind that didn't permit the town to realize that it was licked even when it was apparent to everyone else that it was down for the long count.<br>
<br>
What happened at the meeting in the armory while the embers were still cooling probably sums it up as well as anything.  After it was settled that the city would be rebuilt of brick and stone instead of wood and sawdust, Mayor Moran brought up the Johnstown Flood, which seemed out of place in a town that had just been destroyed because there wasn't enough water.<br>
<br>
The Mayor reminded the meeting that Seattle had raised a sizable relief fund to aid the Johnstown Flood victims.  It hadn't been sent yet, and in view of their own sad plight they might want to keep it with the justification that charity begins at home.<br>
<br>
Seattle voted unanimously to send relief to Johnstown!<br>

Immediately next, in the train of human disasters, to the loss of human life, comes the loss of property.  The extinction of a life appeals directly, only to the one losing it, in the sense that something becomes nothing, and literally speaking leaves no continued interest.<br>
<br>
The loss of property, on the other hand, multiplies the interest in, that its displacement, at once involves an effort for its rehabilitation, and where this loss entails a division of interest upon thousands, the severity of its results, perforce of its own inertia, becomes manifold and widespread.<br>
<br>
Such a condition Seattle occupies, resultant upon the great fire of June 6th, 1889.  Upon this day, this beautiful city of terraces, clutched by 30,000 hands, firmly held aloft to the world, the flag of commercial supremacy in the great Northwest.  Upon this day the ensign so proudly unfurled on high, tottered to and fro in one of the mightiest fire deluges known to modern times.  And upon this day, achieving victory out of defeat.<br>
<br>
She arose from the conflict, still holding aloft in 30,000 hands, her flag of royalty-the ensign burned down to the pole, it is true, but the charred flagstaff of greatness still defiantly towering on high.<br>
<br>
THE START OF A CONFLAGRATION<br>
<br>
On June 6th. 1889, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, smoke was discovered issuing from a window in the basement of a two story frame building on the southwest corner of Front and as the Pontius Block, in a by one John Bachs.  In an incredible brief period the smoke was succeeded by licked up the shavings and wood-workman, and fastened the building.<br>
<br>
The flames were first seen from some steamers lying along the water front whose captains promptly sounded the alarm.  In three minutes from the discovery of the fire the flames had worked their way into an adjoining apartment, occupied as a store room by Dietz & Meyers, whosesale liquor dealers.<br>
<br>
In an instant the whole superstructure was a mass of  fire. Adjoining the Pontius Block was the wooden  Denny Block, which extended along Front to Marion street, whose basement and hallways served as flues to draw the flames, and five minutes after the first alam was given, black clouds of smoke poured fro@ every
window in the building.  The flames attacked the building from the rear, and defied every attempt of firemen to extinguish them.<br>
<br>
One by one the frail wooden partitions succumbed to the intense heat, and as each succeeding apartment was reached the fire gained strength and the basement of the structure was a seething cellar of flame.  The fire burst out of the north end of the block with tremendous violence.  Two streams of water were immediately turned on which served to keep the flames in check, and prevented their spread across the street.<br>
<br>
All hopes of saving the block had now been abandoned and efforts were directed to confining the flames to the Denny and Pontius blocks, and obstructing the passage across Front street to the Opera House, or in the rear across the alley to the Commercial mills and a long line of warehouses.  Steadily but surely the firemen fought their dread  foe, and aided by brave-hearted citizens, the flames were encompassed on every side by heavy streams of water.<br>
<br>
Success seemed almost certain but at the very moment  that a tall column of flame shot up from the center of the doomed structures the cry went up that there was "no water." The numerous streams that heretofore were shot straight into the center of the fire from a dozen nozzles, suddenly ceased.  In an instant a bright red column of flame encircle the whole of the block.<br>
<br>
Fears of a general conflagration became imminent and telegrams for assistance were sent to Tacoma, Portland, Port Townsend and Victor-
ia. Every energy was exerted to save as much as possible of the stock of the various stores that occupied the burning building, and the streets were lined with hurrying men and women, laden with var-
ious articles of value, but the rapid progress of the fire rendered endeavor in this direction of very little use.<br>
<br>
CHAPTER II A TEMPEST OF FIRE ON EVERY SIDE.<br>
<br>
Half-an-hour  after  the start, the fire had assumed such proportions as to alarm the whole city.  The intense heat had lighted the buildings east, west, north and south.  The big four-story brick building on the corner of Front and Marion, known as Frye's Opera House, was a pyramid of fire.  On the west the flames had enveloped the Commercial Mill and numerous warehouses facing on Marion Street, on Colman's Wharf.<br>
<br>
To the north the Kenyon Block, containing the Times printing establishment, Henry Bode, tailoring; Venen & Vaughan's piano warerooms; and other tenants, had been attacked with such vehemence that the occupants had to flee for their lives, leaving their total stock a prey to the merciless flames.  The Kenyon Block lighted the Maddox and Griffith Blocks, on the north-east corner of Front and Madison Streets.  
Southward the large Colman Block, a two-story frame building, extending from Marion to Columbia Streets, was on fire, and Addison Smith's grocery store and the Queen City Candy Factory were already destroyed.  Across Railroad Avenue the flames were sweeping onward, licking up Colman's Wharf, where were situated the wholesale<br>
houses of Staver & Walker,.  Knapp, Burrell & Co., Avery,     Kirk & Lansing, Burdick & Cook, Raymond, Eggery & Co., Fischer & McDonald, Battin & Co., Calder Bros., and the cornice works of John Leck."<br>
Six blocks were already burning, and a fitful wind was hurrying along the work of destruction.<br>
<br>
The two-story brick building on the south-east corner of Front and Marion, occupied by Harms & Dickman and E. Lobe & Co., was the next to catch fire.  From this point the flames spread east and south, attacking in succession Smith & Co., boots and shoes; F. C. Young & Co., Thompson & Fisher, Miss Cheasty's millinery store, J. W. Hughes' coffeehouse, and the big Kenney glock, on the northeast corner of Front and Columbia Streets.<br>
<br>
Eastward the fire extended to Second Street, and now an unbroken wave of ravenous flames, three blocks wide, extending from Second Street to the water's edge, was sweeping north and south, and licking up wooden and brick edifices alike.  Upward, above the dazzling mass of fire, immense columns of smoke streamed forth, and rising to the zenith, bathed in dark hues the blue firmament, from between which shone in blood-red  streaks the  light  of  the sun on this bright June day.<br>
<br>
CHAPTER III<br>
THE CITY AND BURNS ITSELF OUT<br>
<br>
Meanwhile the firemen were by no means idle, although their effectiveness had been curtailed by the failure of the water.  When all hopes of stopping the fire in its-destructive course down Front street had well nigh been given up, an attempt to barricade the flames by use of gunpowder was resorted to.  Mayor Moran, Councilman Durie and Fire Marshal Murphy working-side by side like Trojans, attempted to blow up the Colman block, and a large blast was placed under the Palace Restaurant.<br>
<br>
But the destructive explosive refused to do its work of demol-
ition.  The fire had now reached Columbia Street.  From this street extending to Yesler Ave., a distance of six blocks on the west side of Front Street, stretched a row of costly and palatial brick business houses.  The mammoth dry goods house of Tokas, Singennan & Co. , occupied the corner, and then followed in succession N. Chilberg & Co., Baillargeon & Co., Hershberg & Co., L. A. Treen, Merchants National Bank, Gordon Hardware Co., Seattle Hardware Co., W. P. Boyd & Co., Stewart & Holmes Drug Co., Pumphrey & Co., Seattle Land Co., D. E. Mulligan, Chas Goldstein, A. Hansen and First National Bank.  
The upper floors of these various edifices were the homes of hundreds of professional gentlemen.  The fire up to this time had encountered no serious obstacles to its progress in the way of brick buildings.  The'Opera House, the Harms & Dickman building, and the Kenney Block had already fallen, but the numerous wooden structures around them accelerated their downfall.  A vain hope existed in the minds of many that these solid brick buildings would prove a barrier to the further progress of the fire.<br>
<br>
Meantime the flames had reached the western boundary of Second street, and threatened every moment tb cross it.  On the corner of Second and Columbia streets stood the four story brick building known as the Boston block, containing the Postoffice, and directly across Columbia street was the Colonial block.  Both of these structures were Qn fire repeatedly and their escape from destruction was only due to the'tremendous efforts of the bucket brigade that lined the front of each building.  The flames crossed Columbia Street at 4:30.  The first building to take fire wat the White block on the corner of Front.  The San Francisco store'was the next.  Northward from Madison Street the fire was still pursuing its work of devastation.  From this point up Front street and back to the waters edge the flames surged in living waves without any attempt being made to check them other than futile efforts with buckets and garden hose.  Warehouse after warehouse fell in with a crash, and the wooden business blocks withered like leaves before the bright June day.<br>
<br>
THE FIRE DESTROYS<br>
<br>
1st Ave So. at Main St. in June 1889.  The men are standing in front of A. P. Hoteling & company's liquor store.<br>
<br>
onslaught of the dreadful tempest.  The fire at the north end was finally checked at University street.  A few doors south of University, on Front, stood a story and a half frame house owned by Jacob Levy.  A bucket brigade was formed, and with the aid of water, supplied from A. A. Denny's house, an attempt was made to save the building.  Levy's friends were enthusiastic and rallied to his  support and in a short time there were from sixty to seventy men engaged in carrying and pouring water on the house.  One man who stood in the crowd and watched the bucket brigade work offered to bet $100 against  $10 that the house would not be saved.  The bucket brigade worked with a will, and though the little house was on fire fifty times between 6 and 8 o'clock, it was finally saved.  While the bucket brigade  was engaged in saving Mr. Levy's house the firemen threw the burning sidewalk ' on the west side of the street over the cliff.  The planking in the roadway was ripped up, and there was no more food for the flames.  On the west side of Front street, at University, down on a level with the docks, is the foundation of the Gilmore building.  This was not inflammable and
the fire could do nothing with the bare brick and mortar.  On the north side of University street for a block froin the outer wharf line is a water block.  This stopped the fire here.  Two tracks of the Lake Shore & Eastern railroad cross the foot<br>
<br>
of University street to the Canadian Pacific dock.  Here a large force of men were at work ' with buckets, obtaining their supplies of water from the bay, and with the greatest exertion succeeded in preventing the fire from crossing these trestles and burning the docks to the north.  A bucket brigade made up of about 200 men extended from the water front to the corner of University and Front streets, and by hard work prevented the fire from spreading along by way of the sidewalks on the south side of Front street.  It took several hours of hard work to stem the tide of the flames at the north end, but by 8:30 p.m., all danger of a spread in that direction was practically at an end, and the residents of north Seattle began to breath easier and to thank God,that they would not be burned outof house and home.  The firemen performed wonders in checking the flames at this point when it was considered that there was not a drop of water in the hydrants'at their command.  Twenty minutes after catching fire the San Francisco block, the first of the row of brick buildings, with its entire stock was a mass-'of ruins.  T'he *flames were increasing in fury fanned by a north wind.  The whole block to the east bounded by Front, Columbia, Second and Cherry streets, was in flames while on the west, Yesler's big dock, with its numerous warehouses and commission establishments was enveloped<br>
<br>
in fire.  One by one the walls of the brick blocks 44<br>
<br>
The start of the big fire on June 6,-1889.  Just beyond the last building on the right which is the Kenyon block on the NW corner of 1st avenue and Madison.  The fire started on the SW corner of 1st and Madison.<br>
<br>
crumbled beneath the intense heat, while their costly contents of every description, were being scattered to the wind in columns of black smoke.<br>
At 5:30 twelve blocks and six wharves were a mass of ashes.  The fire had crossed Cherry street and was licking up everything right and left.  Soon tongues of flame shot out from the windows of  the Yesler-Leary block on the corner of Front and Yesler Ave., while the north side of the latter street from Second to the water front was a seething line of fire.  The huge triangle of brick, bounded by James, Second and Yesler Avenue, was the next to fall a prey.  From here the fire jumped across Yesler Ave., and then  the work of destruction was complete.  Nothing tould now be done.  Everywhere on every side raged a torrent of fire.  Brick blocks went down like chaff before a wind.  The fire, as if not satiscied with its proportions  had increased its boundaries by<br>
<br>
creeping up Yesler Ave., as far as Fourth Street.  That portion of the city south of Yesler Ave., was composed principally of hotels
and lodging houses, there being over 150 of the latter.  Nearly all the buildings were composed of wood, and they fell an easy victim to the fire.  Straight to the south with even front moved the terrible wall of fire.  Structures crumbled with the intense heat before the fire had come upon them.  People were obliged to run for their lives.  Horses became wild and unmanageable with fear.  Street after street was crossed.  At 7:30 @the sight was one never to be forgotten.  The entire business portion of the city was a sea of flame.  The setting sun shone blood red through clouds of smol(e and the air was so surcharged with heat that respiration became difficult.  At 8 o'clock the wall of flame had reached the water front on tho south of the city, leaving utter ruin and desolation in its track.  Every wharf, every coal bunker, every business house, restaurant, bank, newspaper, in short everything that could burn was destroyed to its foundation.<br>
The burnt district included forty blocks, or eighty acres, exclusive of the water front, which comprises eighteen blocks, in all fifty-eight blocks, making the total acreage of the devastated territory 116 acres.  Beginning north at the foot of University street the boundary of the district runs east to Front street, thence south half way to Spring street, thence east to Second street, along Second to James, up James to Third, along Third to Yesler Avenue, thence to Fourth street, and from Fourth street south to the waters edge.  In this immense territory not a single building escaped destruction.<br>
<br>
CHAPTER IV<br>
A LOSS AGGREGATING $20,000,000<br>
<br>
Great as was the magnitude of the fire, the loss was confined entirely to the business portion of the city, the residence district being practically untouched, and the heaviest losses fell on those best able to support them.  It is impossible at this date to secure anything like a correct list of the losers.<br>
<br>
The following statement of losers is compiled through the efforts of the.commercial agency of R. G. Dun & co., and although not containing the losses of professional men or small business estab-
lishments, nevertheless contains all considerable losses, as far as possible to obtain them:<br>

The loss suffered by the city by destruction of streets and docks will aggregate $1,100,000.  Many of tho small sufferers lost their all, and in that portion of the city south of Yesler avenue, where the hotels and lodging houses were situated, the loss of personal effects runs into the hundreds of thousands.  A careful estimate places the total loss to buildings and property at $20,000,000, on which the total insurance aggregated  $2,965,000.<br>

CHAPTER V<br>
<br>
A CITY OF ASHES--MARTIAL LAW<br>
<br>
The night of June 6th--a memorable night surely in the annals of Seattle--a night whose darkness was illumined with burning ruins, that in the morning were throbbing with all the impulses and activity of a city.  No death torch ever shone on a ghastlier or a more weird scene, than the mantle of darkness enveloped that night.<br>
<br>
Under a flame-lit heaven, knots of men gathered in groups on all corners, discussing the appalling disaster, or with nervous steps kept sentry watch waiting for the morn that would bring "New Light." Morning came at last, and with it came life, new energy, and new hopes.<br>
<br>
The dawn of June 7th marks the birth of the New Seattle. When the fire had gotten beyond all control, and all hopes of saving the city had been given up, steps were taken to protect the immense quantities of goods that were scattered in endless confusion all over the residence portion of the city.  Mayor Moran called a.meeting of citizens at 8 o'clock in the evening in the Court House and about 200 special deputies were sworn in.<br>
<br>
Colonel J. C. Haines called out the members of the first regiment N. G. W. and martial law was established.  Guards were placed in all parts of the city, and every effort made to guard against the depreciations of thieves and plunderers.  Armory Hall was turned into a temporary resting place for the homeless and destitute, and a relief corps, composed of leading citizens, organized.<br>
<br>
The W. C. T. U. and ladies relief corps established free lunch tables and no endeavor was spared to render succor and sustenance as far as possible to the needy.  Telegrams of assistance began pouring in, long before the night was over, and before the morning, tons-of provisions were on their way from neighboring cities and towns.<br>
<br>
CHAPTER VI
THE NEWS IN TACOMA--THE CHARITY OF HER CITIZENS<br>
<br>
The bright picture attending this appalling catastrophe is the charity and succor extended the inhabitants of the "City of Ashes" in the hour of their adversity.  Throughout the length and breadth of the Northwest  every city. town and hamlet vied with each other in  who should be the first "to aid Seattle." Immediately upon receipt of the news of the disaster in each place, relief committees were formed, and subscriptions, both in money and provisions, were contributed.<br>
<br>
The city of Tacoma was the first to respond to the distress of the stricken city.  Mr. Allan C. Mason employed all the bakers in the city on the night of June 6th , at his own expense, and next morning at dawn dispatched a boat load of provisions from Tacoma to Seattle.  The morning of June 7th committees were organized, known as the Tacoma Relief Bureau, with the following officers: F. M. Wade, Treasurer; David Wilson, Chief of Bureau; A. C. Smith and S. M. Nolan, Purchasing Committee.  Mr. Samuel Collyer, cashier of the Merchants' National Bank, was placed in charge of the subscription list.<br>
<br>
Headquarters for the Bureau were established in Seattle.  Mammoth tents for feeding and housing the homeless were supplied.  A corps of volunteers, composed of the principal citizens of the city of Tacoma, accompanied the Bureau to Seattle, and remained there for a period of nearly three, weeks after the fire, assisting in the work of feeding the hungry and clothing the destitut ' e, and how well those great-hearted people did their work may be gleaned from the following list which embodies the list of subscribers from the city of Tacoma to the Seattle Relief Fund:<br>

adversity.  The first indication of this was exemplified by the usual appearance of the morning papers.  The Post-Intelligencer, the leading paper of the Territory. again SUbstantiated its matchless position, in its struggle for newspaper supremacys by appearing upon the streets, a few minutes after 4 a.m. of June 7th. quickly
followed by the 14orning<br>
<br>
Journal. the entire plant of the former of which, having been literally wiped out of existence just twelve hours before.<br>
<br>
At eleven o'clock. seven hours later, a meeting of citizens was held in Armory Hall to discuss the situation, and devise means for the immediate reconstruction of the city.  Mayor Robt.  Moran presided, and around him were seated six hundred citizens, each one an active business man.  Not a long face was to be seen.  No one familiar with the facts, would have imagined that the assembly, as individuals, was in the midst of a calamity, and the possessor of each face, represented an interest in the great disaster, that was directly personal.<br>
<br>
By a unanimous vote, it was then and there resolved to forever prohibit the erection of any wooden structures in the burnt district, and at this time while the flames from the burning debris were still mounting upward.. energy, hope and confidence depicted itself upon the countenance of every man present.  Telegrams of condolence, and proffers of aid were read,. and a relief coninittee was appointed, to take charge of all monies, clothing and provisions received and distributed, and pemits for the erection of tents were granted, for the temporary transaction of business in the burnt district.<br>
<br>
The good work of feeding the destitute and homeless, became. at once, the all-absorbing ocupation.  The Tacoma Relief Bureau erected quarters on the corner of Third and University streets, and the ladies of Seattle converted Armory Hall into a vast dining-rooin, and with deft hands and cheerful hearts "fed the hungry and clothed the poor." As an instance of how vast a number the amy of destitutes was. it may be stated, that for the first twenty days, immediately subsequent to the fire, over 41,000 meals were served at the Tacomna relief tent.  Among the many noble-hearted ladies of Seattle, who aided in this work of charity, and whose names are deserving of record. in something more enduring than this book, may be mentioned:<br>
<br>
Mrs. W. H. H. Green, Mrs A. J. Fisken, Mrs. J. C. Nevins, Mrs. Rev.  Clark Davis, Mrs. H. S. Parkhurst, Mrs. Ethel Carter, Mrs. Addle Hanley.  Mrs T. E. Handsaker, Mrs. Frank P. Lee, Mrs. A. B.

CHAPTER IX<br>
<br>
BUSINESS RESUMED-2ND STREET THE THROUGHFARE<br>
A CITY REBUILT IN A DAY<br>
<br>
The resumption of business was immediate.  The destructive course of the fire had happily, thanks to the almost super-human efforts of the bucket brigades, not destroyed some of the business blocks, and houses, on the East side of Second street, and these places became, at once, swareming hives of business industry. the offices of the Moore Land Co., on the corner of Second and James streets, which, during the progress of the fire, had become the center, around which a cordon of brave-hearted volunteers, had for two long hours, fought back the furious onslaught of the flames, in their terrific rush, through the wooden block to the west, and to whose ultimate escape is due the safety of a vast portion of the resident district of Seattle, that stretched from this point up to the brow of the hill to the East, becames at once, the nucleus of the new business center.<br>
<br>
New buildings, new hopes, new energies, took shape and form on either sides and for twelve blocks from this point, this street became one ceaseless continuity of tents and projected buildings.<br>
<br>
The commercial business of Seattle today--and it has certainly not decreased since the fire--is transacted under roof of canvas, and one would think that with such a vast volume of goods, scattered everywhere, and in tents that a jack-knife would slit open. that thieving would be rampant.  But it is not-- it would be a very unsafe enterprise, indeed.  A square-toed western honesty has returned to the rightful owner his rescued goods.  It is this sentiment that permits a jeweler and book  store. a printing office and real estate office, a cigar stand and a millinery store, to safely nestle under one roof in one tent.<br>
<br>
It would warm the broad heart of all America to come here and view these ruins on one side, and this most wonderful enterprise on the other.  On one hand, is the charred debris, on the other, the tents of commerce, and in the midst Of all, there is more push. energy, pluck and prope" pride, and unrelenting determination, than was eve, heretofore displayed under like circumstances. is the unanimity of purpose, this determined spirit, this cheerfulness in disaster, and this great-hearted people, that are now engaged in building the new Seattle.<br>
<br>
CHAPTER X
THERE  IS   NOTHING   THAT   SUCCEEDS   LIKE   SUCCESS<br>
<br>
The fire of June 6th is a thing of history.  It cannot be said that in any way it has proven an obstacle to the city's general progress.  The money paid by the insurance companies -- and, let it be said to their credit, that their payments were very promptly made indeed--formed the basis for property owners to begin at once the work of rebuilding.  Money is cheaper in Seattle today than before the fire, and all manner of trade.is just as brisk, and the people are wiser and sturdier in their integrity of purpose after being chastened by misfortune.<br>
<br>
The new Seattle will be a much better city than the old.  It will be constructed on a much more liberal scale, and of brick and stone.  It will have broad business thoroughfares, unexcelled dockage and wharfage facilities.  The old city of pioneer days lies buried beneath 115 acres of ashes, but already out of this grave the young Phoenix is rising glorious in its beauty. and endowed with strength and energy.<br>
<br>
Thirty days after the fire eighty-eight brick palaces, to cost over $5,000,000, are either under way or projected for the new city.  The figures are:<br>

CHAPTER XI<br>
<br>
"FAINT HEART NEER WON FAIR LADY"<br>
<br>
SEATTLE'S REVERSE REPLETE WITH ADVANTAGES<br>
<br>
The indomitable energy, courage and vigor that so quickly manifested itself ih the conduct of Seattle's plucky citizens, while in a measure truly characteristic of the American people as a whole, yet it, like yellow fever, is prone to exhibit itself with more virulence in certain spots than in others.  Seattle is unquestionably one of these  spots.<br>
<br>
The faith of its people, born of the confidence in its geographical position, has given for many years, the people of this city, an independence of thought and action, that has bid defiance to the overtures of selfish corporations or designing mo-
nopolies and single-handed and alone, she has resolutely stood within the arena of her own commercial greatness, and confident in her own strength, has constantly added to her army of veterans, allies from even the ranks of her enemies.<br>
<br>
The unexpected is always staggering.  The shock from the fire was momentary, the cessation of business was also but this, but the advantages were immediate, apparent and lasting.  Seattle's fame was carried broadcast to the world, in the flames of her burning buildings, and she at once became the residuum of new and increased interest.  Unquestionably the chief and predominant advantage ensuing from her calamity, lies in the publicity she derived from her loss.<br>
<br>
The immediate result was apparent in the appearance of large bodies of Eastern capital seeking investment, attracted by the high rates of interest and sound securities offered.  This was accompanied by the adjustment of the losses by the insurance companies, and the consequent distribution of the money.<br>
<br>
Add to this the activity displayed by the merchants and property owners in the erection of buildings and the reconstruction of the same on a grander scale, and in conformity with the re-plat of the streets, and it is safe to predict a city in eighteen months prouder, costlier and greater than were possible without the fire.<br>

Her iron, coal, timber, fish, fruit, citizens and pluck are still here, and valiantly she can stand to-day over the grave of her desolation and say "We have won'."<br>

SEATTLE SEEMED DOOMED<br>
<br>
Ralph W. Andrews, "The Great Seattle Fire," <B>Historic Fires of the West.</B> Seattle: Superior Publishing Company, 1966, p. 105-123.<br>
<br>
"Had a professional arson ring planned to destroy Seattle on the afternoon of June 6, 1889, it would have chosen the rear of the Pontius, Block as the ideal location to set the torch.  Conditions were perfect-a long dry spell, the wind in the right direction, and the frame buildings lining the narrow streets were made to order for the rapid spread of a conflagration.<br>
<br>
"On that afternoon the "torch" was set - quite by accident - the torch being a pot of glue in a basement cabinet shop in the rear of the Pontius Block at what is now First Avenue and Madison Street.<br>
<br>
"Jim McGough's cabinet shop in the basement of the Pontius Block was a beehive of activity on that afternoon, with five cabinetmakers working to fill a stack of orders which had been pouring in.  About 2:15 p.m., a pot of glue boiled over on the hot stove and set fire to some shavings on the floor. . . .<br>
<br>
"One of the men at the cabinet shop, John E.  Back, dashed a pail of water against the flames, washing the burning glue onto a pile of dry shavings on the floor.  What happened after that is not quite clear, but apparently the men attempted to subdue the flames by forming a bucket brigade, but when the fire got away, all hands retreated in great confusion to the street. . . ."<br>
<br>
Clarence B. Bagley in his History of Seattle published in 1916 presents the city of that day.  "The town's rapid growth during the late '80s developed conditions ripe for the conflagration which every American city apparently has to have at some early period in its history.<br>
<br>
North of Columbia Street and on the west side of First Avenue was a row of frame structures mostly two stories in height, and with a sawmill, lumber yards and many wooden sheds between them and the wharves.  Even the pavements were plank.  Streets as well as buildings were generally on posts or piles, and well above the ground or water, leaving a space below through which the fire could travel without hindrance.  The public water supply was at as high a pressure as is furnished now in the same locality, but the mains
were small, the hydrants of limited capacity and only at alternate streets. . . ."<br>
<br>
The Bundy report details the fire-fighting equipment.  "Between 1884 and 1889, the population had increased tremendously, (from 3,533 in 1880 to 42,837 in 1890), but the defenses had remained the same.  Its two little steam pumpers were capable of supplying only three good 21/2-inch streams, barely enough to control an ordinary residence fire.  The water, excellent for domestic purposes, was sadly inadequate for fire streams.<br>
<br>
"The Seattle Volunteer Fire Department at the time of the great fire was no 'comic opera' type of organization.  It was a matter of great personal pride to belong to one of the hose companies.  Only young men of good physique and character, who were also good athletes, were accepted.  Competitive tournaments were staged annually between Seattle, Victoria, B.C., Bellingham, Port Townsend, Snohomish, Tacoma, Olympia, Portland and Spokane.  Seattle was always the team to beat.<br>
<br>
"At fires, the competition between Seattle's two engine companies was intense.  Each company gave its all to beat the other company to the fire and get first water at the base of the blaze - a tradition that has carried over to the present day, as companies still consider being 'first-in' or 'stealing the fire' from another com-
pany, a matter of pride.<br>
<br>
"Seattle's Engine #1 was a third-size Gould steam pumper, purchased in 1879 and housed in a brick engine house on Columbia Street, west of Second Avenue.  Engine #2 was a fourth-size Gould steam pumper purchased in 1882 and housed in the brick combination engine house and City Hall, south of Yesler Way on Third Avenue.  The famed hand engine, Sacramento, had been sent to the Western Mills, about Terry Avenue and Republican Street, in 1882 and played no part in the fire.<br>
<br>
"Hose #7, a four-wheel reel, was in service in the old North School, Third Avenue and Pine Street, and Hose #4 was in service at First Avenue and Battery Street.  The two steam pumpers had been provided horses and a paid Jriver in 1888.  Hose #4 had one horse and a a driver.  The rest of the equipment was handdrawn by sturdy volunteers.  Ladder #1, a <B>65'</B> Preston aerial truck, purchased in 1887 for $765.00, was housed in a shed at what is now Occidental and King Street.  The aerial ladder was a new invention and not yet perfected.<br>
<br>
It was considered a 'white elephant.' No horses were provided for the truck, the volunteers were foreed to hire horses whenever they had to respond to a fire.  In responding to alarms, the two steamers also hauled hose reels along behind.<br>
<br>
"The fate of the City of Seattle was entrusted to a handful of dedicated volunteers, organized in May 1884, with Gardner Kellogg (later to become one of the men directly responsible for Seattle's
present-day excellent department), as its first Fire Chief.  In May of 1888, Josiah (Joe) Collins was elected Chief by the Board of Fire delegates.  The day of the fire Collins was absent, in California....<br>
<br>
Writes Clarence Bagley: "About 2:45 in the beautiful summer afternoon of the 6th of June 1889, (Bundy's research places the time about 2:15 and the time the alarm was received as 2:45) "a cloud of smoke rolled from under the Madison Street side of the Pontius Block, and steam whistles along the waterfront at once blew the repeated blasts that signaled the outbreak of fire.  Engine house bells followed with a continuous jingle, and from the nearest fire station on Columbia Street, at the alley below Second, there came a hose-cart pulled by men and boys.<br>
<br>
Behind them a team of horses drew the town's first steam engine, but this was stopped and attached to the hydrant at Columbia.  The firemen were confronted by a great mass of smoke and could scarcely determine where to throw the water but started a stream from the Madison Street hydrant on the Pontius Building. . . ."<br>
<br>
The Bundy brief describes the action from a fireman's viewpoint.<br>
<br>
"By the time the first engine company arrived, a huge crowd had gathered to watch the fire, many wondering why the fire department<br>
didn't arrive.  Apparently no one thought it necessary to call.  Before the first hose line was stretched, considering the poor water supply and the inadequate fire defenses - the City of Seattle was doomed.<br>
<br>
"Engine #1 arrived at the scene within two or three minutes after receipt of the alarm.  Two hand lines were laid f rom the front of the building back to the closest hydrant, Front and Columbia.  Engine #2, moments later, went around the north side of the building on Madison Street and took suction from Elliott Bay through planking in the street.  They laid their line into the basement, to the base of the fire.<br>
<br>
"Hose #7 laid its line from the hydrant at Front and Madison to the north side of the building, while Hose #4 took the hydrant at Spring and Front and joined the other two companies on the north side of the building.<br>
<br>
"The response to the fire was fast, the lines well placed, and normally the blaze would have been confined to the place of origin and quickly extinguished.  Only one thing was wrongthe fire was out of control, the water supply quickly failed - and within seven hours, Seattle's business district and waterfront would be a sea of glowing embers.<br>
<br>
"As the fire continued to progress, the heat on the north side of the building began to burn the hose.  The Commercial Mill building across the alley also started to burn, forcing Engine #2 to abandon
their position.  They moved south one block to Marion Street and tried to take suction from Elliott Bay, but the tide was wrong.  Another attempt was made from Columbia Street with the same result.<br>
<br>
"Meanwhile, the huge Opera House across Front Street at Marion caught fire.  Engine #1 attempted to get streams on this structure as well as the Pontius Block.  The water pressure was failing fast.  Firemen were able to gain entry into the building but the water supply by this time was so poor, there wasn't enough pressure to lift the water one floor into the building, and they were forced to abandon any hope of saving the structure.<br>
<br>
"At this point the crowd was in a carnival mood, still treating the fire as a large joke.  As the streams continued to become more feeble, the crowd began to jeer the volunteers.  Engine #1 was forced to pick up their equipment and retreat to Columbia Street.<br>
<br>
The hydrant there was of no use.  They moved to Cherry Street with no better luck.  At this time the water pressure had been so reduced that a stream from the hydrants would not rea@ch ten feet.<br>
"After a short conference between the commanding officers, it was decided the best move was to attempt to save their equipment, and both Engine #1 and #2 retreated to Third Street and Yesler Avenue, while Hose #4 and #7 moved north to Spring Street and Front Street.  Seattle's Mayor, Robert Moran, took command and ordered buildings in the path of the fire -dynamited.  This only provided good kindling for the unquenchable blaze which now advanced towards the Skid Road, a roaring inferno. . . ."<br>
<br>
The Bagley history continues with a more detailed description of the fire's progress.  "To the north the danger did not appear so im-
minent for the breeze from the bay was apparently a protection.  Westward the sheds and lumber belonging to the Commercial Mill were blazing in spots and the employees were waging a futile right with their own hose lines.<br>
<br>
On the southern side the Marion Street end of the Colman Block was smoking in the great heat: this was a two-story frame row reaching to Columbia.  At this time men appeared with hose from the steamer that had then commenced to pump from salt water, but they could not get near enough to the Colman Block to wet it down: the side and roof burst into flame and the conflagration was started on its southerly course.  The Opera House was then well on fire.<br>
<br>
"Realizing that a great disaster was impending, telegrams asking for help were sent to Victoria, Portland and all the larger towns between.  For two or three blocks to the east and south, people were moving stocks of goods, law libraries and all sorts of personal belongings.  Over the fire rose an enormous column of rolling and twisting smoke which could be plainly seen from Tacoma, and with it a shower of sparks and b r a n d s.<br>
<br>
Some of the latter alighted on an old frame building near what is
now the southeast corner of Western Avenue and Columbia, and presently a furious fire was raging there.  Before the main conflagration had burned a third of the Colman row, flames from this old structure had set fire to the rear of the Union Block, which was a three-story brick building next south of the San Francisco store, at First Avenue and Columbia.<br>
<br>
At this juncture, a party of men under the able leadership of Mayor Robert Moran fired heavy charges of explosives under the Palace Restaurant in the Colman Block, but while the building was shattered, an effective gap was not made and the fire swept onward.  Several other attempts were just as unsuccessful.<br>
<br>
"There being only an excavation where the Burke Block was later built, on the northwest corner of Second and Marion, furniture and scenery from Frye's Opera House were piled there, only to be burned in the great heat from the theater.  There were then only two brick buildings on the east side of First Avenue, north of James; these were the Reinig, across Marion from the Opera House, and the Kenney at the end of the same block at Columbia.<br>
<br>
The former, occupied by Harms and Dickman, was quickly in a blaze, and the wooden buildings to the east and south took fire almost as speedily.  At 4 o'clock the flames were crossing Columbia west of First Avenue; five minutes later the Kenney Block was burning on the roof, and at 4:40 p.m. its walls were falling.<br>
<br>
The small frame structures along Second from the paint store of Harris and Greenus at Marion, to the hardware store of McLaughlin and Bridges at Columbia, went down one after the other, but being low the heat was not so great as to prevent, by strenuous efforts, the saving of the Colonial Block, a two-story frame row on the northeast corner of Second and Columbia.  A line of shade trees here gave considerable protection.  On the Haller corner it was noted that a stream from a fire hose would not reach the roof on the one-story building, so much had the water pressure diminished.  This was at 4:15 p.m.<br>
<br>
"The flames were then raging from Second to the Bay, and from Columbia nearly to Spring, for the intense heat in the vicinity of First Avenue and Madison was spreadiiig the fire northward against the wind.  In this direction the first to go were the two-story frame buildings on the northwest and  northeast corners of the latter streets.<br>
<br>
The former was called the Kenyon Block and contained the Times printing establishment; the other was owned by M. R. Maddocks and occupied by a drug store.  Along the waterfront a furious fire was raging, fed by Colman's and other large wharves, the warehouses of Staver and Walker, Knapp Burrell and Company and others, and the great Commercial Mill with all its lumber; the bucket brigades and firemen were driven back again and again.  
On the southeast corner of First Avenue and Spring, the excavation for the Holyoke Block gave a chance, and finding that the fire was not likely to cross Spring on that side, a determined and successful fight was made to save the Amos Brown house, on the northeast corner of First Avenue and that street.  It was a strategic point, for in the rear of this frame building was a very large wooden structure, once used as a skating rink, and directly opposite it on Second, a frame church.<br>
<br>
The fire would have gone from one to the other across Second, and then up the hill into the residence district.  Luckily the Brown residence stood, but the scorched paint and broken glass showed what an effort was made.  The same struggle was continued up First Avenue and the fire did not get across above Spring.  It swept north, however, in spite of determined opposition, with the inadequate means at hand, destroying among other large buildings, the Northwestern Cracker Company's factory and the plant of the Seattle Electric Light Company and the Seattle Ice concern.<br>
<br>
Fortunately, on the southwest corner of University was the open area formed by the foundation of what was later the Arlington Hotel, and west of that a clear space crossed only by the railroad trestles, and there the fire was brought to a halt.  It was 8:30, though, before this was certain.<br>
<br>
"Columbia Street was no obstacle to the onward sweep of the conflagration toward the south.  An effort to blow up the White Building on the southeast corner of First Avenue was a failure.  The firemen and a host of willing volunteers were helpless.  The line of fire crossed, with the portion west  of First Avenue considerably in advance; it seized upon the fire station back of the present Hinckley Block and soon the bell f ell from the tower with a great crash.<br>
<br>
When it involved Boyd's photograph gallery, on the southwest corner of Second, the window casings of the large brick Boston Block commenced to smoke and the glass cracked.  Nearly everyone thought the building doomed, but by heroic efforts with pails, pans and anything that would hold water, the windows were protected until the greatest heat of the fire had passed by.<br>
<br>
The post office, then in this building, was partly moved, but was in order again by night.  No other brick building was left unburned in the business district.  Some small frame structures in the same block south of it were destroyed.<br>
<br>
"Meanwhile the fire progressed down First Avenue, through the solid row of brick build<B>ings </B>on the west side of the street f rom Columbia to Yesler.  The San Francisco Store, (Toklas-Singerman's), the Union Block, the Poncin, Starr, Arcade and Yesler-Leary, were one after the other in flames, the last about <B>6 </B>o'clock.  This was the most imposing array of buildings Seattle had.  Back of them to the bay everything was on fire, down to Moran's machine shop on Yesler.<br>

On the east side of the street, the frame stores burned steadily, the fire reaching Cherry at 5 p.m. On Second the St. Charles Hotel, on the northwest corner of Cherry, blazed with an intense heat, but in spite of this the Wyckoff House on the southeast corner was saved.  This stood where the Alaska Building now is.  Not far from 5 o'clock the wind changed about and blew from a more southerly direction, giving new spirit to the fire fighters, but it soon changed back again to the regular northwestern summer breeze.<br>
<br>
The Tacoma firemen came in about that time, having made the run over the Northern Pacific in sixty-three minutes.  Unfortunately, there was no engine in Tacoma at the date, so they brought  only a hose carriage and hose which were of little use after the water pressure failed.  However, they worked very hard, and so did another detail from the same city, which arrived at 7:50 p.m. with more hose.<br>
<br>
"At 6:30 the fire reached the Occidental Hotel at James, Second and Yesler.  This was the town's most pretentious hotel and many thought it fireproof.  The Pioneer Block corner at First Avenue and James was then an open excavation but a three-story frame building on the Butler property at the corner of Second burned fiercely and warmed up the Occidental until clouds of smoke came from each of its four stories.<br>
<br>
"All at once it burst into flame with a roar like an explosion and filled Yesler Avenue with fire; the heat was so tremendous that people nearby had to run for their lives.  Buildings on the south side of Yesler took fire instantly, and even the Collins house, across Second, was in a blaze so rapidly that its inmates could barely escape.  From the Collins place the fire extended up the hill to Trinity Church, and the prisoners were hastily removed from the courthouse at Third and Yesler to save their lives.<br>
<br>
"But the fire did not cross that street and swept to the southerly limit along its western side.  In the block below Yesler there was quite a fight to save Father Prefontaine's church when the fire went by across the street, and happily this was a success.<br>
<br>
"When the fire crossed Yesler it simply ran riot among the frame buildings on the 'flats.' From Third South to the bay it moved with a whirlwind of its own making in front.  There was no time to save goods and not very much to save life; by 9:30 it had carried devastation as far as there was anything to burn and then stopped for lack of material.<br>
<br>
"The night of June 6th is a memorable time in the annals of Seattle.  Most of the city was brightly illuminated by the flames which still covered 116 acres of what had been the most valuable part of the town.  In the red glare men gathered in groups discussing the disaster which had befallen them and making plans for the future.<br>
<br>
They could see that destruction was complete in practically the entire business district.  Nothing but broken walls remained of the
city's mercantile row; the continuous line of brick buildings from Columbia to Yesler on the west side of First Avenue including the stores of Toklas and Singerman, Chillberg & Co., Griffith Davies, the Bank of Commerce, R. L. Durant, Charles Goldstein, L. A. Treen, Herschberg & Co., Baillargeon & Co., the Merchants National Bank, the Gordon Hardware, Stewart and Holmes, the Seattle Hardware Co., W. P. Boyd, Pumphrey & Co., and Albert Hanson.<br>
<br>
West of First Avenue and south of University Street, for a distance of four-fifths of a mile, every wharf, warehouse, mill, factory, maebine shop and lumber yard was utterly destroyed, and the waterf ront was nothing but blazing timbers and piles.  The east side of First Avenue and west side of Second were in ruins from the southern tide flats to Spring Street on the north; on the eastern side of Second all was gone below the Boston Block except some small buildings between Cherry and James, and this destruction extended east to what are now Third Avenue South and Third Avenue as f ar north as James.<br>
<br>
"The district below Yesler had been the business center up to a year or two before; at the time of the fire it contained mostly frame hotels and lodging houses of the most combustible character.  Schwabacher's large wholesale house was on Yesler just west of First Avenue South, and Gardner Kellogg's drug store next to it.  Mr. Kellogg, like many another volunteer fireman, lost the chance to save his goods by fighting the fire.<br>
<br>
The Washington Iron Works had a large plant on Jackson Street and Second Avenue South.  There were also many extensive warehouses and wharves, notably those of the Pacific Coast Company.  At the latter were the steamships Mexico and Ancon, which loaded their decks with personal belongings brought to them for safekeeping and then drew out into the bay.  This was likewise done by smaller craft at other points.<br>
<br>
"The calls upon other cities for assistance brought the Tacoma contingents promptly, as has been stated.  S o m e firemen came f rom other localities, but without apparatus.  The next to arrive were a party of volunteers from Olympia just before midnight; these brought a Silsby steam fire engine in less than four hours on the little steamer Fleetivood.<br>
<br>
Some time later a train from Portland drew  in with another Silsby engine and firemen from that city, but were much delayed in finding a place to unload.  At 4 o'clock the steamer T. J. Potter arrived with more volunteers and an English Merriwether engine from Victoria; they left home at 11 and could see the glow of the con-
flagration in the sky from the very start.<br>
<br>
No other engines came, because there were no more in the state, except at great distances away.  All these firemen went to work with a will and made themselves extremely useful during the rest of the night and the next day.  Most of the time their machines were worked
from vessels or barges in the bay.<br>
<br>
"In the late afternoon calls were sent out to all members of the militia companies to report at the armory forthwith, and the soldier boys responded so promptly as to be there to take charge of the county prisoners brought up from the jail about 7 o'clock.  In order to attract attention to the call, Col.  J. C. Haines, of the First Regiment, N.G.W., mounted his horse in full uniform and rode about the streets just outside the fire district.<br>
<br>
After it was seen that the courthouse would not burn, the soldiers escorted the prisoners back to Third and Yesler again.  The other companies of the regiment were called out and arrived during the next day; the downtown portion of the city was kept under martial law for about two weeks, with headquarters at the armory on Union Street between Third and Fourth.<br>
<br>
"Mayor Robert Moran called a public meeting in the evening at the courthouse and 200 special deputies were s w o r n in to preserve order.  Relief measures were inaugurated at once and telegrams offering assistance came in that night.  In Tacoma the citizens went to work at once preparing food and supplies, and at dawn sent over a boatload of provisions.<br>
<br>
The weather was fortunately fine and there was no such distress as there would have been had the fire gone up the hill into the residence district.  Great tents for the homeless were set up the next day, and the ladies' relief organizations saw to it that no one went hungry.<br>
<br>
"The published list of losses footed up an adding machine total of $7,179,725 and adding $1,100,000, which is an estimated figure for the losses of the City of Seattle in streets, docks, etc., makes $8,279,725.  There is no mention in the lists of the Water Company or the Electric Light Co. for their losses on their mains, wires and poles in the burned district.  The figure for the City of Seattle may be high.  On the strength of the value of personal effects in lodge houses and hotels, added to the foregoing figures, the total loss has been placed as high as $20,000,000, but this is out of all reason....<br>
<br>
"The dawn of June 7 marks the birth of a new Seattle.  With the flrst light, the ruin-lined streets were full of animation.<br>
<br>
The city did not give itself time to cool off.  Its people were ready and anxious for the task of reconstruetion.  The Post Intelligecer upheld its newspaper supremacy by appearing a few minutes after 4 a.m., though its entire plant had been wiped out of existence just twelve hours before.  It was followed a little later by the Morning Journal.<br>
<br>
"Seven hours later, at 11 o'clock, the people of the stricken city
met in Armory Hall to plan for immediate reconstruction.  Mayor Robert Moran presided and about him were seated 600 citizens, each one an active businessman.  No one would have imagined these men were in the midst of a calamity.  It was a meeting representative of the city's best energy, hope and confidence.  By unanimous vote it was resolved to prohibit forever the erection of any wooden structures in the burned district.<br>
<br>
After telegrams offering assistance had been read, a relief committee was appointed to take charge of all money, clothing and provisions received for distribution.  Permits were granted for the ereetion of tents for the temporary transaction of business in the burned district.<br>
<br>
"Just as in every other crisis which Seattle has faced in its history, the city brought forth its strong figbting men.<br>
<br>
Previous to the fire several thousand dollars had been raised for the sufferers of the Johnstown flood, but the money had not been sent when the fire broke out.  A suggestion made at the meeting that the money raised for Johnstown should be diverted for the urgent need at home was promptly bowled down, the whole meeting, with one great voice, shouting 'Send the money to Johnstown!'<br>
<br>
"In a stirring speech, Judge Cornelius Hanford scorned the suggestion that Seattle should take the money that was already pledged to the eastern sufferers.  Judge John P. Hoyt, then a power in the financial world, pledged the support of the banks to the efforts of the people to rebuild on the ruins.  Angus Mackintosh and Jacob Furth promised that their respective banks would be of all the assistance possible and would not make any effort to profit by the fire.  Watson C. Squire struck the chord that was dominant in the meeting when he stated that he was ready to commence building and was merely waiting until the bricks of the old structure became eool enough to remove.<br>
<br>
"One of the brightest spots in the story of Seattle's fortunate misfortune was the immediate offers of aid, especially from Tacoma.  As soon as news of the fire was known, eities and towns throughout the Northwest vied with one another in aiding Seattle, though no appeal for aid had been made.  Tacoma was the first city to respond.  On the night of June 6th, Allen C. Mason employed all the bakers in that eity at his own expense, and at dawn the next morning dispatched a boatload of provisions to Seattle.<br>
<br>
The same morning the Tacoma Relief Bureau established headquarters on the present site of the Federal Building at Third and Union.  Samuel Collier, cashier of the Merchants National Bank, was placed in charge of the subscription list.  Large tents for feeding and housing the homeless were supplied.<br>
<br>
In addition to this, Tacoma in one hour raised $10,000 cash for
relief and subsequently made its cash contribution double that amount.  San Francisco sent $10,000 cash; Olympia $1,000; Virginia City, Nevada,  $4,000, and other towns accordingly.<br>
"On the 12th, 200 men were set to work with teams to clear the streets of debris in the burned district.  All workmen were given employment at once at good wages to build up 'New Seattle.'<br>
<br>
"The sales of real estate were checked only for a few days and regained their activity by the time agents and owners eould find places to earry on business; meanwhile outside capital poured in from all over the country for investment.  The reconstruction of electric and eable lines of the street railways, totally destroyed in the burned district, was begun almost immediately.<br>
<br>
"For the first twenty days after the fire more than forty-one thousand meals were served in the Tacoma relief tent.  'Tacoma's extraordinary relief work did a great deal to heal the breach that existed between the two eities,' says Welford Beaton in The City That Made Itself, 'and no matter what the future may bring forth for these two leading cities on Puget Sound, Seattle should never forget that in the hour of her direst need Tacoma stood nobly by her, fed her people and gave as bountifully of her money as her food.'<br>
<br>
"The women of Seattle also aided in the relief work, converting Armory Hall into a vast dining room.  Within a month the general relief committee of Seattle, composed of J. R. Lewis, E. P. Ferry, John Leary, Griffith Davies and George H. Heilbron had received total cash contributions of $98,805.<br>
<br>
"The resumption of business was immediate.  A few business blocks and houses on the east side of Second Avenue remained undestroyed and these became the headquarters of industry.  The office of Moore Land Company on the corner of Seeond and James was the nucleus of the new business center.  For twelve blocks on either side Seeond Avenue became a lane of tents and projected buildings.<br>
<br>
"For many days the banking and commercial business of the city was transacted under canvas roofs.  Thirty days after the fire eighty eight brick buildings to cost more than three million dollars were either under way or projected for transformed Seattle.<br>
<br>
"A splendid spirit of courage and faith took possession of every heart; adversity made friends.  As soon as the cooling of the embers would permit, tents and temporary structures made their appearance all over the burned district.<br>
<br>
The public schools, which had closed temporarily, were reopened on Monday, June 10th.  Large quantities of lost goods were gathered up by orders of the mayor and returned to owners as far as they could be ascertained.  Contributions from all parts of the United States soon began to arrive.  Every business firm in the city received telegrams from their eastern supply houses offering to send at once
any quantity of goods wanted.<br>
<br>
"The work of clearing away the wreckage was prodigious, alone costing many scores of thousands of dollars.  At the beginning of the restoration serious embarrassment was experienced because there were neither railway depots nor docks for the landing of building materials.  It was f ully six weeks bef ore arrangements were perfected to receive brick, iron, lumber and other materials in any considerable quantities.<br>
<br>
The rapidity with which the city rebuilt itself sent Seattle's fame over the country.  Nothing like it had been witnessed on the American continent with the single exception of Chicago during the period immediately succeeding the great fire of 1871.  Within a year there was accomplished inside the limits of the burned district a general building construction nearly matching the total loss of buildings and merchandise in the fire. . . ."<br>
<br>
Writing again of the fire department activity, George Bundy states: "After the fire, the fire department rented a barn on University Street, just east of Third Avenue, to house its equipment.  The citizens, refusing to accept the blame for the fire, began to criticize the volunteers.  A succession of chiefs followed: On July 10, Josiah Collins resigned; on August 2, Jack McDonald was appointed, in September, he resigned.<br>
<br>
"Seattle did not inaugurate a paid fire department because it wanted to - it was forced to take this step.  The volunteer companies disbanded in disgust and only a few were willing to ever serve again.  On October 21, Gardner Kellogg was persuaded to take over the position of rebuilding the Seattle Fire Department and was appointed the tirst paid Fire Chief.<br>
<br>
"Chief Kellogg took a firm hand in dealing with the disgruntled citizens who were still critical of the fire department.  He issued a public statement, 'Had the best fire department in the world been on the scene at the time, the results would have been the same.' In rebuil(ling, Kellogg was able to attract some outstanding firelighters to Seattle, recruiting from Chicago, St. Paul, and other eastern cities."<br>

SEATTLE FIRE.<br>
<br>
Edgar I. Stewart, "The Seattle Fire of 1889," <B>Washington. Northwest Frontier.</B> New York: Lewis Historical Publishing Company, 1957. p. 159-164.
In 1889, Seattle, Ellensburg, and Spokane Falls had been swept by fire, Seattle in June, EllensbKg in July, and Spokane Falls in August, each of them thus undergoing an experience which every American city apparently has to undergo at some early  period in this development, the two best known examples being those of<br>
San Francisco and Chicago.<br>
<br>
The great Seattle fire broke out at about three o'clock in the aftemoon of the sixth of June, when a careless workman overfumed a pot of glue in the wood-working shop of Victor Cairmont, located at the corner of First Avenue and Madison Street.  Many factors contributed to the rapid spread of the conflagration.  For one thing Seattle was at that time almost entirely a city of wooden frame structures with sheds, woodyards, and other structures, all of wood, located between the buildings.<br>
<br>
Many of the strect pavements were of plank, and the streets as well as the buildings were built on posts or piles well above the ground or water, leaving a space below through which the flames were able to travel with both ease and terrible rapidity.  While under normal conditions the water pressure would have been sufficient, the mains were small and the hydrants, which were of limited capacity, were located only at alternate street corners.<br>
<br>
Physically, Seattle was simply not equipped to fight a fire of the magnitude of the one that developed.  The fire department was somewhat archaic, being more of an object of derision that of interest or of pride.  Most of its shortcomings, however, were simply due to the fact of being "outgrown" more than to anything else.<br>
<br>
The fire chief was in San Francisco and his assistant<br>
James Murphy, who was in charge, "did not prove equal to the occasion, then or later." The fire spread rapidly, speeding underneath the wooden pavements, while sparks and brands were carried to adjacent buildings by the wind, which blew steadily from the north, and it was not long before the fire was of such magnitude that the column of smoke could be seen from Tacoma.<br>
<br>
As more and more hose companies had reached the scene of the blaze, the water pressure began to drop alarmingly, as the fire fighters had only two steam engine pumps, and each new hose connected up meant that much loss in pressure.  It was not long after the first alarm had sounded that Seattle officials began to realize that a disaster of the first magnitude was in the making and urgent requests for immediate aid and assistance were dispatched to all the nearby communities.<br>
<br>
The Tacoma firemen were the first to reach the scene, arriving in Seattle after a sixty-three minute run over the Northern Pacific, really remarkable time in view of the circumstances.  But they were able to render little real service other than relieving the tired Seattle men since they had no steam engines and the low water
pressure made it impossible for the hose-companies to do very much.<br>
<br>
By this time the fire covered an area extending roughly from Spring to Columbia streets and from Second Avenue to Elliott Bay. The heat had become so intense that the flames were actually moving north against the wind.  Finally stopped on the north by open excavations the fire then spread to the south crossing Yesler Way and burning the flimsy wooden structures between that street and the bay until it finally burned itself out for lack of <B>fuel.  </B><br>
<br>
In a space of about seven hours almost the entire business district had been rcduced to ashes.  Almost everything west of Second Avenue and south of University Street to James Street had been destroyed, only a few buildings escaping.  From that latter point south and west of Third Avenuc and Third Avenue south to Elliott Bay there was complete destruction.<br>
<br>
By ten o'clock in the evening the fire had been brought under control, an accomplishment due not only to the heroic efforts of the fire-fighters who had performed remarkably well in view of the many handicaps, but also to the fact that the supply of combustibles had been exhausted.  At midnight the steamer Fleetwood arrived from Olympia bringing an engine company, and before morning an engine company arrived by train from Portland.  Although the fire was well under control these firemen were able to relieve the over-tired Seattle crews who were on the verge of exhaustion.<br>
<br>
At dawn a boat-load of provisions, mostly in the form of cooked food, was received from Tacoma.  Tents had been set up to provide shelter for the homeless but personal distress was not as great as it might have been, since the residence section of the city had largely escaped unscathed, and the refugees consisted mostly of those persons who had lived in the hotels and rooming houses in the southern part of the city, and were now rendered both homeless, and destitute by the blaze.<br>
<br>
Many persons had escaped at the last moment with nothing more than the clothing that they were wearing at the time.  That there was a great deal of personal distress is evident from the fact that a relief tent set up by the Tacoma citizens served more than forty-one thousand meals in the three weeks following the fire.<br>
<br>
The property loss has been variously estimated at between nine and twenty millions of dollars, the latter figure probably being too high, and the former too low since it does not take the "intangibles" into consideration.  That there was no loss of life was almost a miracle in itself since many persons fled the flames with their clothing on fire, and in one or two instances firemen who h-ad been almost cut off by the flames had to abandon their equipment and flee for their lives, in some cases passing through<br>
a wall of fire.<br>
<br>
The work of relief and reconstruction had begun almost immediately. 
Martial law was proclaimed soon after the fire h-ad been brought under control, and Mayor Robert Moran deputized some two hundred local citizens to preserve order and prevent looting.<br>
<br>
The Seattle Post-Intelligencer, displaying the enterprise in the face of difficulty that has characterized it throughout its long career, was able to get out a skeleton paper the next moming, and several Seattle businesses carried on temporarily from tents.  Doctors Clarence A. Smith and James Eagleson set up their practice in a tent located in a front. yard at the corner of Third Avenue and Columbia Street, with the appointments being written on a slate fastened to a polc at the front.<br>
<br>
Indeed, what is often referred to somewhat flippantly, and often sarcastically, as "the Seattle Spirit" never showed to better advantage, and a "jingle" popular at the time expressed it:<br>
<br>
"Slightly disfigured but still in<br>
the ring<br>
This is the song Seattle will<br>
sing."-<br>
<br>
That it was undaunted is shown by the fact that just previously to the fire, several thousand dollars had been collected for the relief of victims of the Johnstown (Pennsylvania) flood.  The money had not been sent, and at a meeting of citizens, the day following the almost complete destruction of the business section of Seattle, the suggestion that the money be retained for local use rather than sent across the continent, was defeated without even the formality of a vote.<br>
<br>
But the city did receive a great deal of aid and assistance from the outside, the amount reaching almost one hundred thousand dollars.  Of this Tacoma contributed twenty thousand and San Francisco half that amount.  One interesting side-light is that Virginia City, Nevada, at this time a thriving municipality, sent four thousand dollars.<br>
<br>
The work of rebuilding the city was not only begun at once but went forward with a speed that astonished almost everyone.  Seattle was not only rebuilt, but it constructed a better and more beautiful city.  The streets were raised, regraded and widened; unsightly and dangerous corners were removed, and in order to prevent a recurrence of <B>the</B> disaster, a morc stringent code of building regulations was adopted.<br>

When the order was received the beautiful city of Spokane Falls was in flames.  Her noble business blocks, the pride of her citizens, were crumbling to atoms before the intense heat.  The wildest confusion and disorder prevailed.  The lawless element, which unfortunately forms a part of the population of every pros-
perous city in the Northwest, in the excitement of this great calamity were unrestrained by fear of the law.  The police force of the municipal Government, although as efficient as of any city in Washington, was by its limited numbers, entirely inadequate to perform the multiplicity of duties which were imposed upon it. Valuable property was abandoned with reckless indifference in order to save life.<br>
<br>
It was amid such scenes as these, which may be imagined but not described, that I was ordered to call into active service the National Guard; not to take, but to save life; not to confiscate the enemy's property, but to preserve the possessions of our friends and fellow citizens, and to assist in maintaining law and order.<br>

Captain J.F. Hemingway, upon my order, reported for duty with his entire command; also Lieutenant Colonel Waters and First Lieutenant J.J. White, of my staff, and First Lieutenant E.J. Fellows, Commissary on the staff of Colonel Pike, Second Regiment, N.G.W.  After assembling of the command, I reported to Mayor Fred Furth for orders, whereupon he instructed to take entire charge of the city and surroundings and guard the same, as in my judgement it required, asking me to take full control of everything and that he and the police force would assist and act on my suggestions.  During the fourteen days and nights we were on duty, we found him ever ready and willing to assist the National Guard, and at the close of our services he fully appreciated the good we had done and complimented the force for its services.<br>
<br>
The National Guard of Washington, and especially that portion of it on duty in Spokane, will ever remember him as a true friend, who appreciated the efforts of the officers and men, who were indeed untiring in their labors and unceasing in their vigilance to aid the municipal officers.  Major Green, of the Second Regiment, Major J. Kennedy Stout, of the Governor's staff, and Assistant Adjutant General Booge, of my staff, also rendered me valuable aid.<br>
<br>
A cordon of troops was placed about the burnt district, which covered an area of twenty blocks.  As this patrol had to be maintained day and night, I found that the force of the National Guard was too small to adequately perform the duty, and I called for volunteers from the Posts of the G.A.R. at Spokane Falls.<br>
<br>
Forty of these noble veterans responded to my call, and these with the officers and members of the National Guard for fourteen days and nights performed the efficient and arduous duty of guarding the valuable property contained in safes and vaults, prevented spoilation and plunder by the disreputable characters who infested the town, preserved order and assisted in every way at the time of general distress.<br>
<br>
Tents were obtained for the officers and men of the National Guard and volunteers from the G.A.R. Posts, and strict and perfect camp discipline prevailed during the entire time.  Rations were furnished upon my requisition from the relief tent provided by the municipal authorities.<br>
<br>
"It would be invidious for me to make personal commendation of aid and service at a time when everyone did their utmost.  The conduct of the soldiers of the National Guard was characterized by close attention to duty, efficiency and untiring vigilance. The members of my own staff and other officers mentioned herein were ready for active work both day and night, and the citizens of Spokane Falls owe them a debt of gratitude which it will be hard to repay.  I cannot close this report however, without special reference to the services of Lt. Col. Waters, 1st Lt. White, and 1st Lt. E.J. Fellows.  Too much credit cannot be given
to their prompt and efficient work and the active part taken by them on this occasion."<br>
<br>
I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,<br>
<br>
A.P. CURRY, BRIG. GEN., COMDG.<br>

<br>
SPOKANE WAS REDUCED TO ASHES.<br>
<br>
The hot grease sizzled as Bill Wolfe threw another pork chop into the frying pan. Suddenly, there was smoke and a poof, and the whole frying pan burst into flame.<br>
<br>
The man leaped back against the restaurant counter and tried to kick the pan off the black iron stove.<br>
<br>
"Hey, what's going on over there?" spoke up one customer across the room.<br>
<br>
The flames caught on a greasy towel hanging above the stove. Abruptly, the fire shot all the way up the wall.<br>
<br>
Cries of dismay echoed through Wolfe's lunch room. One customer dashed outside to summon help and find water.<br>
<br>
The August heat hit him in the face. Low in the skies a pall of dreary smoke hung over Spokane Falls. Fires had been burning in the  Coeur d'Alene  forests for several weeks, and not one drop of rain had come to moisten the tinder dry trees.  Even in  Spokane Falls, everything was tinder dry.<br>
<br>
It was 6:15 p.m. on August 4, 1889, in this rapidly city of about twenty thousand people.<br>
<br>
The man yelled to a pair of police officers strolling down Railroad Avenue.  One officer immediately ran to ring the alarm.  The other charged into the flaming interior of Wolfe's small rickety restaurant, which was located just three doors west of Post Street on Railroad Avenue across from the Northern Pacific train depot.<br>
<br>
Officer Dick Smith glanced as the fire went sweeping the wall behind the lunch counter.
"Oh, I think we'll be able to take care of that all right. All we need is a few buckets of water. This little fire will be under control in no time."<br>
<br>
But no one could located enough buckets of water fast enough. Bill Wolfe's whole restaurant was soon a mass of flames. The fire began eating through the ceiling into the lodging house upstairs.<br>
<br>
In the meantime, at the first clang of the bell atop the fire station, eighteen volunteer firemen ran to the station and rounded up every piece of equipment they had, a hose cart, pump, and horse drawn fire engine. Away they went to the scene of the fire.<br>
<br>
But it also happened that Rolla A. Jones, the newly appointed city water commissioner, had decided this hot Sunday afternoon would be a good day to go fishing at the lake. He left the key for the recently installed water works in care of someone who knew nothing about operating the new equipment.<br>
<br>
So when the firemen hooked their hose up to a fire hydrant near Wolfe's Lunch Counter and trained the nozzle on the flames, water spurted out only in dribbles. There was no water pressure and no one knew how to get any.<br>
<br>
The firemen ran frantically from one hydrant to the other, but it was the same at each one. They looked grimly at each other in the glare of the roaring fire, not wanting to believe the one clear fact, their hoses were useless in fighting a fire which by now was certainly going to take more than a few pails of water to  quench.<br>
<br>
All the while the fire was billowing higher and higher. No long was the blaze confined to the flimsy frame structure housing Wolfe's eating place. Flames had engulfed the building next door and then had leaped to the Russ home nearby.<br>
<br>
By this time, heavy black smoke curling out of the top of the buildings had attracted, on the run, almost every able bodied man in Spokane Falls and even some of the hardiest women and children.<br>
<br>
A bucket brigade was formed to haul water from all the taverns, hotels and restaurants in town. The smoke from the fire was even casting a darker shadow over the pall of smoke already hanging over the city.<br>
<br>
A gasp of panic arose form the bustling crowd as people spotted flames creeping up the side of the beautiful new Pacific Hotel. But their voices were whipped away in the roaring wind of flames. In a few minutes the dome of this fabulous hotel fell with a crash.<br>
<br>
Knowing that the few splatters of water here and there would
never quell this raging inferno, volunteers were soon rumbling into the imperiled area with wagons carrying dynamite. Buildings would have to be sacrificed to save entire blocks.<br>
<br>
The fire had now enveloped a whole row off flimsy frame buildings along Railroad Avenue. The Minneapolis Lunch Room, the Coeur d-
Alene Saloon, the Blue Front Lodging, and the Railroad Lunch Counter were all caught in the seething grasp of the fire.<br>
<br>
Then the wind suddenly changed directions and another gasp when up from the crowd. Sparks and flames leaped like trapeze artists across the street, hungrily attacking the Northern Pacific Depot and the officers and freight buildings of the  Spokane and Palouse railways. The startled whistle of a train approaching the depot mingled discordantly with the ravenous crackle of the fire consuming the railroad buildings.<br>
<br>
And then, for one moment the first explosion of dynamite dwarfed every other sound for blocks around including the menacing roar of the fire. People who thought they were safe form the explosion had to scuttle for cover to avoid being hit by flying mortar, dirt, and flaming material.<br>
<br>
but the fire licked onward. In some cases, the dynamite served as a detriment to the fire fighters instead of an aid. Sparks flung from the explosion ignited areas previously untouched by the flames. The wind generated by the howling holocaust brought other flames dancing all the way across the empty spaces left by the dynamite. Many times the wind carried sparks over long distances, spreading the seeds of fire rapidly.<br>
<br>
Soon, several blocks had burst into seething walls of flame. Rumors were going around that the entire city was doomed.<br>
<br>
Hoping to get a first hand view of the situation, Mayor Fred  Furth, clattered his skittery horse up one of the streets between burning blocks using his arm to shield his face against the searing heat. Then he galloped away, hoping to do something about the water supply. On the way out of the burning area, the mayor was forced to skirt two well dressed businessmen engaged in a full blown fist fight.<br>
<br>
"I'm gonna' have that rig if I have to kill you," snarled one.<br>
<br>
The other came back with a punch in the jaw, "Oh, ya!"<br>
<br>
Every wagon or other rig in Spokane Falls had been requisitioned to help salvage business records and other valuables. Some panicky businessmen were willing to pay fantastic sums of money for the service of a wagon. Often fight resulted after two distraught men rushed to employ the same rig.<br>
<br>
Darkness was falling quickly. Soon the flames billowing above the city looked like a red, roaring river in a blackened river bed.
The tremendous fire cast an eerie glow visible to surrounding towns miles away.<br>
<br>
Whirlwinds created by the blazing areas sent burning embers hurtling across the Spokane River igniting lumber and flour mills on the other side. But heroic effort and plenty of water saved buildings on that side of the river from any extensive damage.<br>
<br>
About ten o'clock spectators watched with awe the fiery plunge of the Howard Street bridge into the Spokane River. A boom of logs floating by at that moment burst into flames, and for hours afterward illuminated the water as it floated down the river.<br>
<br>
With the help of new water supplies and repeated dynamite explosions the fire was finally brought under control shortly after ten p.m. Blowing up the big Pacific Saddle Company's building had saved the entire Crescent block, including the city hall, the newspaper office, and the Commercial Hotel.<br>
<br>
But before the enormous blaze had burned itself out thirty-two city blocks had been razed by the fire. A stream of homeless people straggled forlornly across the Washington and Post Street Bridges to seek relief in the coolness of the pine trees.<br>
<br>
They clung desperately to everything they had left in the world, often only a pet or a picture.<br>
<br>
The Great Fire of 1889, which could have been quenched by only a few buckets of water would still be remembered almost a century later as both the greater disaster and the most important turning point in the history of Spokane Falls.<br>
<br>
Some people said that the fire was a blessing in disguise. The city could now be built anew, better planned and more substantial than ever before. The smoking embers had barely cooled when a huge tent city began to rise above the fire's wasteland. Just days later preparations were under way for construction of bigger and safer buildings to replace those destroyed by the fire.<br>
<br>
Within a few years, a visitor would never have guessed that the beautiful, fast growing city of Spokane had been the victim of such a catastrophe.<br>
<br>
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br>
<br>
"Did a greasy stove really start the great fire...or did Irish Kate's honor?"<br>
<br>
Spokane's great fire of 1889 started o a greasy stove in  Wolfe's Lunch Counter or did it?<br>
<br>
Some people insist that whiskey, not sizzling grease, was the cause of the biggest catastrophe in the history of Spokane.
So...when you turn back the clock and relive the tale of Irish Kate, it comes out this way:<br>
<br>
"...Irish Kate stood at the bar absently sipping her watered down whiskey in the saloon on Railroad Avenue. A grizzled middle aged man sidled up to her, blowing whiskey breath into her face, as he whispered, " Can I buy you a drink, doll?"<br>
<br>
She gave him a scathing look, " Nope, I've had too many drinks from your kind already today."<br>
<br>
Then Irish Kate ran her fingers through her frizzled hair to see if it needed frizzing again. It was as flat as a deflated balloon. She brushed haughtily past the whiskey breather and hurried upstairs.<br>
<br>
It was 6 p.m. on August 4, 1889.<br>
<br>
The girl closed the door to her room, and carefully placed a curling iron in the glass chimney of a kerosene lamp to heat. She had barely gotten the iron adjusted in the chimney when the door was shoved open, and the same drinker who had accosted her downstairs stepped into the room.<br>
<br>
The fiery red harried Kate confronted him boldly. "And who said  you could just come stomping into my room without knocking? Get out of here this instant!"<br>
<br>
He staggered drunkenly toward her, yelling hoarsely, "When a man offers a lady a drink, she accepts. But maybe you're no lady. You were rude to me down there sister. Now I'm gonna' teach you a lesson."<br>
<br>
Irish Kate picked up a big glass pitcher to throw at him.<br>
<br>
"Get away from me, you maniac!" she shrieked.<br>
<br>
She heaved the heavy pitched, but it shattered on the floor beside him.<br>
<br>
The man, livid with rage, grabbed her by the arms and began to shake her. Irish Kate tried to kick  him. But she fell backward against the table. The kerosene lamp containing the curling iron began to wobble. Then it suddenly crashed to the floor. The man pulled back in surprise.<br>
<br>
The kerosene spread quickly over the floor and burst into flames. Not looking back once, the drunk fled from the room.<br>
<br>
Eyes wide with fear, Irish Kate grabbed the few belongings she had and fled also, slamming the door behind her. She took refuge in a building across the street. She didn't want to be blamed for starting a fire.<br>

In the meantime a brisk breeze from an open window had fanned the flames higher and higher. A pair of white lace curtains was an easy victim for the hungry blaze. Soon the whole room was a roaring inferno.<br>
<br>
And so the Great Fire of 1889 was on its way, that is according to the Irish Kate advocates of how the famous fire got started.<br>
<br>

NORTHWEST FIRE LOSSES WERE BIG<br>
<br>
Tremendous Conflagrations in Cities of Washington Territory Brought on Great Fear of Incendiarism<br>
<br>
A series of most destructive fires in seven Washington<br>
territorial cities in 1888-89 led to the current belief that<br>
the burning of the cities was the work of "firebugs," recalls<br>
R. F. Radebaugh, then editor of the Tacoma Ledger, later of<br>
the Tribune.<br>
<br>
The repeated disasters caused cities and Tacoma particularly strengthened here fire-fighting equipment, while property was watched by armed men. Seattle's donation of $15,000 to Spokane without stating that the money was from the Seattle relief fund, so generously supplied previously by various cities, gave rise to great suprise among those who believed the ommission of due credit was deliberate, he relates in his 52nd article.<br>
<br>
By R. F. Radebaugh<br>
<br>
The period of preparing for the constitutional convention<br>
and admission of Washington as a state - from the spring of<br>
1888 to the summer of 1889 - was marked by such a number of<br>
large and very destructive fires in cities and towns of our<br>
territory as to arouse suspicion that they resulted form a de-<br>
liberately organized plan and purpose of destruction.<br>
<br>
The first victim was Goldendale, practially all wiped out. The next was Palouse, the business portion of which was burned May 17, 1888,<br>
at a loss of $250,000. Roslyn was destroyed June 23, the es-<br>
timated loss being $400,000, only 5 per cent of which was cov-<br>
ered by insurance.<br>
<br>
The Seattle fire was lighted June 6, 1889, loss being var-<br>
iously estimated as high as $10,000,000 with adusted insurance<br>
of $2,750,000. A few weeks later Vancouver, Wash., suffered<br>
a heavy loss. That fire was followed, on the night of July 4,<br>
by the burning of Ellensburg. Just one month later, to-wit,<br>
August 4, the business section of Spokane was consumed, entailing
a loss of $12,000,000, exceeding that of Seattle by $2,000,000 -<br>
insurance about $2,500,000.<br>
<br>
Cities Unprepared<br>
<br>
In that time not one of our communities was adequately<br>
prepared in water supply, equipment or organization for success-<br>
fully copingwith the fire fiend. even in a perfectly calm state<br>
of weather, much less in a forceful drive of wind or moderate<br>
breeze. So, when the match had been applied, under favoring<br>
air movement, at the strategic point for quick spreading com-<br>
bustion, or the lighted lamp had exploded or accidentally tum-<br>
bled upon the floor, igniting the building, all that the author-<br>
ities and other citizens could do was to cry out and telegraph<br>
their woe, calling for help; - the same, when rendered, proving<br>
of small effect for rescue or amelioration.<br>
<br>
Conscious of their long, inexcusable and almost criminal<br>
neglect and consequent helplessness, and under a constantly in-<br>
creasing apprehension from the latest news of fire-bug activity,<br>
there ensued throughout the territory a feeling of near panic<br>
which gave employment to numerous armed watchmen and detectives<br>
on duty at all hours and which threatened in the public print<br>
and otherwise extreme measures of shooting on sight when they<br>
should be able to discover the miscreants.<br>
<br>
Tacoma Bought Engines<br>
<br>
Tacoma, being no exception to the rule of excitement caused<br>
by those fires took warning and, shortly after the Seattle ca-<br>
lamity, ordered four Silsby engines, two of which were delivered<br>
here about the middle of August. One of them was assigned on<br>
Tacoma Avenue near 7th Street, and the other on the hill near<br>
the public school in the 1st ward. The council built suitable<br>
houses for them, bought and trained powerful young horses to<br>
haul them and proceeded in comprehensive manner to organize and<br>
further equip an efficient fire department.<br>
<br>
These engines were publicly tested in the presence of the<br>
city council and a large assemblage of interested citizens.<br>
The fires were lighted under boilers containing cold water taken<br>
from the hydrant at 9th and A Streets. Steam was made in 5 min-<br>
utes and 15 seconds by the chief's stop-watch when a fair stream<br>
played through 100 feet of hose and one and one-eighth nozzle.<br>
As the pressure increased the stream was thrown 50 feet higher<br>
than the Tacoma Hotel. Two streams were thrown by one engine<br>
through a two-inch nozzle to about the same height.<br>
<br>
Thoroughly Tested<br>
<br>
The next test was through four streams played simultane-<br>
ously through three-quarter inch nozzles. This test amply dem-<br>
onstrated to those present the great power of the pumps, these
stream being thrown, considerable above the highest point of<br>
the hotel. Moving the engine to the intersection of 9th Street<br>
and Pacific Avenue, streams of various diameters were thrown<br>
and held for long periods 30 feet over the flagstaff on the<br>
Fife (now Donnelly) Hotel.<br>
<br>
Points particularly observed to the great satisfaction of the spectators were the steadiness in the operation of the machine, there being the slightest vibration when the work was heaviest, and the case with which the steam pressure was maintained, the safety valve blowing off most of the time. Both of the engines were of the No. 4 size. They were built by the Silsby Manufacturing Company of Seneca Falls, N. Y., finished in nickel plating and were pronounced by the spectators as splendid and reliable working machines.<br>
<br>
Owners of improved property gave expression to their sense of relief and security due to the protection available in those powerful engines and no one complained at the expense.<br>
<br>
Tacoma Helped Spokane<br>
<br>
Personal needs of the poor caused by the Spokane fire for<br>
food, clothing, bedding, etc., were reported to be far less<br>
in the case of Seattle, being liberally provided for, chiefly<br>
in the item of food, from the surrounding thrifty farms. But<br>
Tacoma, nevertheless, promptly came to the front with cash in<br>
this emergency, also, contributing $4,083.50, all of which was<br>
received by the Spokane relief committee,as also a shipment of<br>
most needed supplies from 12 of our merchants.<br>
<br>
Samuel Martin's contribution was his mare "Kittle," which Messrs. J. C. Weathered and L. E. Sampson, composing the Tacoma committee, sold for $456, which added to the donation of cash, made up the above total.<br>
<br>
On the day next following the fire at Spokane quite a live<br>
item of news, in form of the telegram copied below, was given<br>
out there for publication and promptly repeated in the press,<br>
causing a pricking of ears, rubbing of eyes, much wonder, and<br>
ardent praise for Seattle among the people of the Coast:<br>
<br>
Seattle, August 5.<br>
"Spokane National Bank, Spokane:<br>
Charge to our account with $15,000 and pay to your relief com-<br>
mittee, from the citizens of Seattle. Can we do anything for<br>
you?<br>
"FIRST NATIONAL BANK"<br>
<br>
Upon that unqualified and surprising claim The Ledger com-<br>
mented as follows: No one will dispute the right of the receiver<br>
o f a gift to give it to some other person. But it cannot be<br>
regarded as otherwise than ungracious to make a parade of gen-<br>
erosity at another's expense. If this dispatch had read 'from
our relief fund,' instead of 'from the citizens of Seattle' it<br>
would have stated a wholesome and unchloroformed truth."<br>
<br>
Seattle Had Excess<br>
<br>
The contributions for relief of Seattle were: San Diego,<br>
$418; Portland, $8,000; San Francisco, $10,000; and Tacoma,<br>
$20,000 - a total of $38,418. This proved much in excess of<br>
the requirements of the situation, due to the prompt employment<br>
of the needy in the long job of clearing away the wreckage and<br>
debris in the "city of tents" which soon marked and distinguished<br>
the burnt-over business district - ample funds for which work<br>
were derived from the insurance companies.<br>
<br>
What Editors Said<br>
<br>
Remembering the large donation made by Portland to Seattle,<br>
the attention of the Oregonian was immediately focused upon the<br>
false pretense of the telegram and, observing in its exchanges<br>
the credit for generosity so easily won, said editorally:<br>
<br>
"We find these and similar paragraphs in many of the papers<br>
of Oregon and Washington territory:<br>
<br>
"Seattle is gritty. Although not yet out of her own ashes,<br>
when Spokane is in trouble the late unfortunate city telegraphs:<br>
'Seattle wires you $15,000 and sends you a carload of bacon.'<br>
Such generosity, under similar circumstances is unexampled. -<br>
Polk County Observer.'<br>
<br>
"Seattle sent $15,000 to Spokane. After her own sufferings<br>
she might reasonably have been excused from any contribution<br>
whatever, yet she far exceeds in generosity all other cities<br>
of the coast, and nearly all put together. Corvalis lifts her<br>
hat to Seattle. She can appreciate generosity in other cities. -<br>
Benton Ledger.'<br>
<br>
"Honor to whom honor is due. Seattle did a very thought-<br>
ful and commendable act, but not especially a generous one.<br>
From the relief fund contributed by other cities, and of which<br>
a large amount still remained unexpended, Seattle sent to Spo-<br>
kane $15,000 . The citizens sent no money to Spokane, nor<br>
could it be expected that, suffering from losses as heavy, or<br>
heavier, than those of the peopleof Spokane, they would do so.<br>
<br>
But they had in their possession the generous donations of others so generous, indeed, that the aggregate was more than sufficient<br>
for the necessity it was intended to relieve, and it was in a<br>
spirit of justice that the custodians of that fund turned over<br>
to Spokane a liberal part. The error that led to the miscon-<br>
ception of the source of Seattle's contribution is attrihuted<br>
wholly to the man who sentthe dispatch, when, with the natural
instinct to a boomer, he wrote, 'Seattle wires you $15,000.'<br>
He should not have neglected to add 'from the unexpended balance<br>
of her relief fund."'<br>
<br>
Where Dispatch Failed<br>
<br>
The criticism of the Oregonian seems to point to the banker<br>
who wrote and sent the dispatch of August 5, signed "First National<br>
Bank" as having been actuated by "the natural instinct of a<br>
boomer," in neglecting to add that the money transmitted came<br>
from the Seattle relief fund. That it was in fact a part of<br>
that fund was shown in a report of the Seattle Daily Journal<br>
of a meeting of representative citizens, including Mayor Robert<br>
Moran, Bailey Gatzert, president of the City Water Works Com-<br>
pany, John Leary and many others, both the board of trade and<br>
the chamber of commerce being well represented. The report said:<br>
<br>
"Many short speeches were made, all agreeing that aid must<br>
be sent at once to the unfortunate city, but there was consid-<br>
erable difference of opinion expressed as to the amount that<br>
should be forwarded.<br>
<br>
It was finally agreed that $15,000 in cash should be taken<br>
from the Seattle relief fund now on hand and forwarded to Spo-<br>
kane for immediate relief of the sufferers.'<br>
<br>
Mayor Moran sent the following dispatch:<br>
<br>
"To Fred Furth, Mayor of Spokane: Our whole people sorrow<br>
over your great calamity and extend their earnest sympathy.<br>
Seattle wires you $15,000 and ships you a carload of meat, and<br>
hopes and believes that you will at once rebuild even more sub-<br>
stantially and grandly than before.<br>
"ROBERT MORAN, Mayor."<br>
<br>
Neglect of the bank of Seattle's mayor to state in their<br>
messages that the money was taken from the relief fund caused<br>
general belief that the omission was intentional and deliberate<br>
and for the purpose of gaining public applause as for extraor-<br>
dinary generosity.<br>

SPOKANE FIRE OF 1889<br>
<br>
Ralph W. Andrews, "Spokane....1889, a night of terror, devastation and awful woe," <B>Historic Fires of the west.</B> Seattle: Superior Publishing Company, 1966, p. 128-131.<br>
<br>
"Sunday, August 4, 1889, became memorable as the date of the
'great fire.' The flames originated in a row of frame buildings near the corner of Railroad Avenue and Post Street, just opposite the old Northern Pacific passenger station.  There had been no rain f or many weeks and fierce forest fires were burning in the Coeur d'Alenes.  A dense cloud of smoke hung over the city, sometimes obscuring the sun.  On the first anniversary of the conflagration the Review retold the story of that fiery evening:<br>
<br>
"The blaze seemed a trifling affair and a bystander watching it before the firemen arrived remarked: 'Six men could check the fire with buckets, the firemen will have it under control in a few minutes.' The fire department arrived promptly and worked well, but there was no water.  Men ran from one hydrant to another, while others impatiently held the nozzles of the empty hose.<br>
<br>
"The flames increased, slowly burning their way from the roof of the two-story building to the lower story and gradually extended to the adjacent houses which almost filled the entire block.<br>
<br>
"Darkness came on and the assembled crowd moved back in amazement  as the flames mounted higher to the sky.  Mayor Furth galloped into the crowd on horseback, then galloped away to look after the water supply.  The situation became alarming and whisperings were heard that the city was doomed.<br>
<br>
Word went round that Superintendent Jones, of the water works was out of town and the man in charge of the pumping station was unacquainted with the machinery.  The whole block of frame buildings was ablaze and the flames had created a high wind.  The Pacific Hotel stood near, then one of the handsomest structures in the city.  Before water came, its front began to yield, the plate glass began to crackle, curling clouds of smoke crept through the openings and arrows of flame shot through the swirling smoke banks.<br>
<br>
"Then came the panic, for the people realized that no power could check the conflagration.  Hundreds hurried away to save their own effects.  Every available vehicle was brought into requisition and fabulous sums were offered for assistance in the salvage of valuables.  In less time than it takes to relate the story, the dome of the Pacific f ell with a crash and a whirlwind arose that speedily swept over the block adjoining northward.  In a moment that block was ablaze.<br>
<br>
"The scene was both grand and appalling, but there was work to be done.  Those who had gone to the telegraph office to inform that a fire was raging here, went again and found that building in flames.  Shrieks of women and children commingled with the commanding tones of the teamsters the firemen and thousands of other voices, all of which were drowned by the roar of the sea of fire.<br>
<br>
"People supposed at first that such buildings as the Hyde block,
Eagle, Tull, Granite and the Frankfurt would prove a barrier, but even these went down like children's playhouses.  On the destroyer swept until the river was reached.  All the banks, all the hotels, the postoffice, the land office, all the large business houses were destroyed in less than four hours from the time the alarm sounded.  Every pound of giant powder that could be obtained was used in the blowing up of buildings on corners and by this means much valuable property was saved.<br>
<br>
"At the river masses of burning shingles and even flaming timbers floated northward in the air, igniting the mills on the other side, but by great effort and the judicious use of the little dynamite that was left, the fire was conquered there.  Several bridges were destroyed but the Washington and Post Street crossings were saved.  Over these a terrified and motley stream of homeless people passed, seeking shelter under the pine trees and relief from the smoke and heat and din of the ruins.<br>
<br>
They were not heavily burdened, for there were few downtown dwellers who had time to save anything of value.  Some had blankets, others pillows and a few carried bundles on their backs, but most of them were scantily attired and bankrupt of all personal effects.  Among the latter were many theatrical and importing' people, who were in great distress, for they lost not only all they possessed, but their means of earning a livelihood was gone.<br>
<br>
"Before the midnight train on the Northern Pacific was due, a rush was made for the depot.  A scene of turmoil and destruction was there presented.  The tracks had been destroyed all the way from Monroe to Washington Street; the telegraph wires and poles were down for a greater distance.<br>
<br>
Men and women from the telegraph office  were at work, tapping the wires at both sides of the burned district to accommodate the thousands who were clamoring for means of communication with the outer world.<br>
<br>
The clanging of the church bells had ceased, but still there were shrieking of locomotives and hoarse shouts of men in the<br>
railroad yards, seeking  to  save  the   company's effects.  Both passenger  and  freight depots were gone and blazing cars were hauled away to protect the long trains that stood on the side tracks.<br>
<br>
"Thirty-two blocks in the heart of the city. had been destroyed.  No vestige of their former grandeur remaining, save the blackened walls and smoldering wrecks in basements.<br>
<br>
"The conflagration was under control by nine o'clock and before midnight the city was placed under military laws.  Ropes w e r e stretched across the principal streets and lines were plainly
marked.  Notices were issued forbidding intrusion upon the stricken territory.  Badges were issued those who could show that business demanded their admittance, but others were strictly refused, for the city was filled with thieves.<br>
<br>
"Great alarm was felt lest there might be much suffering for want of provisions and appeals for aid went out over the wires.  Sub-
sequent facts afterwards demonstrated that this alarm was unfounded, for a few carloads of supplies, f or which most of the people in need of them were amply able to pay, would have been sufficient, but the panic was so great that the officials were possibly justified in their calls for assistance and the response came promptly, bountiful and overwhelmingly.<br>
<br>
Money was not needed, yet thousands of dollars came by wire, mail and by express.  Tents came from Fort Sherman and Walla Walla and blankets, quilts and clothing from other sources sufficient to supply an army.  Bacon was corded up like wood in a forest and hams were shipped in by the ton with whole carloads of canned goods.  Pickles, preserves and other delicacies accumulated to such an extent that a large force of men were employed to receive them.<br>
<br>
"The actual loss in dollars and cents was never ascertained, owing to the great number of small dealers, mechanics, lodgers and others, who had lost all and carried no insurance and made no report.  Thirty representatives of insurance companies were sent to adjust the losses.  They found over  $6,000,000.  Two deaths occurred during the fire and several persons were injured.  Fortunately only the business district was burned and all the residences, the schools and the churches escaped.<br>
<br>
"When the sun came up the morning after a dismal scene was presented.  Towering amid the smoke and above the glowing embers were the charred remains of stately structures.  Thousands were scurrying hither and thither viewing the appalling scene.  Exclamations were uttered that Spokane Falls had received its death@ blow.  A dense smoke hung over the city and the sun wore an angry look.<br>
<br>
"Despair was depicted upon many a face until a rallying voice, seemingly borne upon the breezes, swept over the throng.  The effect was electrical.  'It was a blessing in disguise,' the people said and the city will rise again, stronger and better than ever before.'<br>
<br>
"The mayor and president of the board of trade called a meeting of citizens and the council jointly, and Superintendent Jones, of the water works, was permitted to resign.  Committees were appointed to look after individual cases of distress.  The fire limits were extended and assurance given that better protection would be afforded in the future.  Additional fire apparatus was ordered by telegraph, authority was given to buy horses to draw the hose
carts, an electric fire alarm was ordered.<br>
<br>
This reassured the men who had lost their fine structures and they began bidding against each other for choice locations.  Before the day was ended three banks had purchased corners at Riverside and Howard at $1,000 per front foot and architects and builders were at work.<br>
<br>
Tents were erected for temporary use and all through the fall and winter thousands of men and teams were employed.  The ruined walls were knocked down with dynamite and the rubbish cleared away.  As soon as plans could be drawn and material obtained, grander structures were in process of construction. . . ."<br>
<br>
G. W. Roche, who conducted a real estate business in the Frankfort block which was destroyed by the flames, related his experiences: "The scene to those who witnessed the terrible conflagration will long be remembered.<br>
<br>
"The hoarse shouts of the men running in all directions, the shrieks of women and children, the rattle of the wagons, the tolling of church bells, the shrill whistles of locomotives as they hurried to and fro trying to save the cars lined on the N. P. tracks, the angry roar of the flames, the embers and shingles flying through the air, the explosion of giant powder (used in blowing up corner buildings in an effort to cheek the flames), all combined to make the night hideous in the extreme. . . .<br>
<br>
"All was chaos.  People rushed excitedly here and there in an endeavor to save some of their valuables.  Goods were removed from the blocks only to be licked up by the flames in the streets.  Fabulous prices were paid for vehicles, ranging from $50 to $500, to use in removing the more costly stocks, and often the poor distracted merchant upon carrying out his goods arrived on the sidewalk only to find his conveyance gone, the owner having accepted a better price from another.<br>
<br>
"The Northern Pacific Railway's passenger and freight depots were burned to the ground and the tracks destroyed from Monroe to Wash-
ington Street.  Yet the loyal railroad men, after Herculean efforts, succeeded in removing to places of safety a large number of cars.<br>
<br>
"A large number of the people took refuge on the south side of the railroad, while a motley crowd interspersed liberally with an element of the sporting fraternity, fled across the Post Street bridge and there under the shelter of the pine trees, surrounded with bedding, bundles of clothing, trunks and other belongings watched the weird sight of the burning city....<br>
<br>
"I watched the start of the fire from Harry Flood's restaurant, situated on the northeast corner of First and Post Street, diagonally across from where the fire started.  From the two-story
lodging house the fire soon spread to the lower buildings in the block, jumped across Post to the Pacific Hotel, a magnificent structure of brick and granite.<br>
<br>
"I saw a team hitched to a string of twelve new vehicles trying to escape the fire, but unluckily instead of continuing east on Sprague they turned up Howard Street in an endeavor to cross the tracks and were trapped and all but the team of horses were reduced to ashes.  I returned to my offices in the Frankfurt block and helped in trying to save this, the best constructed four-story building in the northwest.<br>
<br>
Harry and Louis Baer and myself worked shoulder to shoulder pouring streams of water on the window frames, holding our water soaked hats before our faces in one hand and the hose in the other.  But our work was futile, the heat was so terrific it crumpled the steel shutters up like tissue paper and the brick walls seemed to melt like wax.<br>

SPOKANE FIRE.<br>
<br>
Edgar I. Stewart, "The Spokane Fire of 1889," <B>Washington. Northwest Frontier.</B> New York: Lewis Historical Publishing Company, 1957. p. 162-164.<br>
<br>
By coincidence the Spokane fire broke out just one month after the one in Ellensburg, originating in a lodging house near the corner of Railroad Avenue and Post Street and just opposite the old Northern Pacific Railroad Station late in the afternoon of Sunday, the fourth of August.<br>
<br>
Both the city and the surrounding country were tinder dry, as there had been no rain for several weeks.  In addition a pall of smoke from nearby forest fires hung over the city.  It had been a warm and pleasant day and the usual crowd of Sunday strollers were not at all concerned when the blaze was first discovered.  It seemed, as was remarked at the time, that half a dozen men with buckets could be able to take care of the fire without difficulty.<br>
<br>
The fire department arrived promptly but there was no water and the site was too far from the  river for a bucket brigade to bc feasible.  As the fire spread the crowds began to congregate and the rumor began to go around that the water superintendent was out of town and that the man who had been left in charge did not understand how to operate the machinery, although later there was
another story to the effect that he was intoxicated.<br>
<br>
For the first time the seriousness of the situation was apprecia-
ted, and the people began to be alarmed for the safety of their own possessions.  The evacuation of surrounding buildings was immediately begun, but in many cases not in time.  Many of the buildings were later blown up in an effort to halt the spread of the flames.<br>
<br>
Within four hours the fire had swept to the river, destroying thirty two blocks in the heart of the city, roughly the district between Washington and Monroe streets.  Buildings destroyed included the Public Land Office, the Post Office, all the banks and all the hotels, as well as the principal business houses.<br>
<br>
Several bridges were burned but those crossing the river at Washington and Post streets were saved, and over them a steady stream of refugees swarmed to the north side.  As in the case of Seattle, the fire did not touch the residential section of the city or the distress and destitution would have been much greater.<br>
<br>
Most of the refugees were members of the sporting and entertainment world, persons who had lived in the hotels and lodging houses that had constituted such large portion of the sections destroyed.  The actual property loss was never established with any degree of accuracy, since there were so many small losses that were never settled, or even reported, but the adjusters for the insurance companies paid claims amounting to more than six dollars.  Two persons lost their lives as a direct result of the conflagration.<br>
<br>
As had been the case in Seattle, gifts of money and supplies came from many places, and as is usual in the case of great disasters, other American municipalities responded generously.  Food of -all sorts was received, hams and bacon in large quantities especially being contributed.  There was one rather unfortunate result in that no very accurate record of receipts and disbursements was kept, and later there were a number of ugly rumors as to what had become of some of the money and supplies.<br>
<br>
Complaints were made to the effect that some of the funds intended for relief had been diverted to the pockets of various officials, and there were charges brought but no one was ever convicted or for that matter even brought to trial.  But the rumors persisted and were not without influence in subsequent years.<br>
<br>
The three fires [where Spokane, Seattle and Ellensburgh had burned] had much in common in that in each case it had been viewed at the time as a calamity of the first rank, but in the longer view none was an unmixed disaster since a large number of temporary and unsightly buildings were destroyed, and in each case -a much finer and more beautiful city arose from the ashes.<br>

The next year fire swept and destroyed the business districts of Walla Walla, Dayton, and Pullman.  In every case the city was rebuilt and in addition there was a great building boom -all over the state since it was necessary to house the thousands of newcomers who were pouring in over the railroad lines.<br>

TILLAMOOK BURN.<br>
<br>
Stewart Holbrook, "Tillamook Burn," <B>Wildmen, wobblies and whistle punks.</B> Corvallis: Oregon State University Press, 1992, p. 167-173.<br>
<br>
It started a little after one o'clock on the hot and dry afternoon of August 14, 1933.  Up to that hour the lookout forester perched on top of Saddle Mountain in western Oregon looked down on a world as handsome as man ever saw.  Below him there were thousands upon thousands of acres of trees, taller than masts, greener than the sea, thick. straight, and old with the centuries-the fir named for David Douglas.<br>
<br>
He loved this world beneath him, did the lookout, and guarded it with all of his faculties of sight, sound and smell.  On this particular afternoon he was unusually alert, for the weather was bad.  He scanned the hills, the valleys and the flats with a keen eye, looking for only one thing; and at a quarter past one on this August day he saw it.<br>
<br>
At that moment, as his eyes swept a wide arc to the north, a billow of white smoke came rolling up out of Gales Creek Canyon.  He sighted along his fire finder a moment to make certain of the location, then picked up the telephone at his elbow and called his warden at Forest Grove, reporting in his usual laconic way and in the proper manner for lookouts, the section, township and range of what he said looked to be quite a smoke.<br>
<br>
That was how fast word of what was to be Oregon's greatest forest fire, indeed the greatest forest fire North America has ever known, came out of the woods.  A moment before the lookout got on the phone, a logger on a crew working deep in Gales Creek Canyon had watched while a length of wire rope used in yarding timber sawed across a wind-felled tree.  An instant later a thin puff of smoke curled up.  In another instant it was white still, but not so thin, and the watching logger shouted.<br>
<br>
"Fire!" he cried.  Fire it was, fire to burn up four centuries of trees, fire to remove an immense natural resource from the face of northwestern Oregon.<br>
<br>
That was how it began, and this tiny beginning, so uncalled for that the gods must have wept, was what the Pacific Northwest will remember for many a year as the Tillamook Fire.  There have been forest fires more deadly to man than this one, but never one so deadly to trees, nor yet one so certain to be remembered so long.<br>
<br>
Hundreds of men fought valiantly all night on that August 14, and for all the good they did they might as well have remained in
their camps.  The fire leaped into the tops of the trees and swept on with fearful speed, making its own wind a,,, it went.  Those great trees, many of them 300 feet high, burned like tremendous torches.<br>
<br>
I saw one great body of Douglas firs, each nearly 500 years old, burn savagely like so many huge columns of fat, spitting, crackling, then roaring like flame under a bellows.<br>
<B><br>
<br>
Smoke rolled</B> and billowed above the flames.  It formed, for two days, a pillar and mushroom that stood clear and white and terrible five thousand feet above the forest.  Presently ashes were drifting through the screens of the windows in Portland homes, fifty miles away.  The wind over the fire rose at last to a hurricane and the noise was greater than the sea pounding the Oregon shore.<br>
<br>
It rumbled and thundered and was marked by the deep booming of ancient trees uprooted by the gale and crashing down.<br>
Five hundred more men, then a thousand more, then two thousand were hurried to the lines that now formed a front along a hundred miles, and mariners far at sea saw dead embers fall on the decks of their ships, while the tides piled debris two feet deep along the Oregon beaches.<br>
<br>
Tillamook County, Oregon's great timbered pride, was going up in flame and smoke.  I saw it burn and I never expect to see another sight like it.<br>
<br>
Logging camps and the homes of stump ranches went up. Time after time, when the great blaze suddenly lashed out at the fire fighters like an angry snake, the crews had to turn and flee for their lives, leaving their trucks and bulldozers and pumps and hose and axes and shovels to burn on the spot.<br>
<br>
Throughout the region deer in small herds and alone, frantic and confused, moved westward ahead of the flames, but many were caught and killed in their tracks.  Cougars, the great cats of the woods, ranged with fear and uncertainty through the heavy smoke, coughing like humans and paying no heed to humans or deer.<br>
<br>
In a hundred streams, till then cool and clear, pools were soon white with the bellies of trout, dead from charcoal stomachs. (Fish leap at bits of charcoal, thinking them flies, a-nd die from their lunch.) One could only guess, by the pitiful balls of naked flesh found after the fire had passed over, how the myriads of grouse and pheasants had fared.<br>
<br>
A sudden shift of the wind, on the tenth day of the conflagration, brought immediate danger to Camp McGregor, logging headquarters of
the Oregon-American Lumber Company.  An hour later the main body of the fire was only half a mile from the camp, and spot fires were springing up within a few yards of the buildings.  Men fought these near fires, a rear-guard action, while wives and children were loaded aboard a logging train.<br>
<br>
The train pulled out just as the camp itself started to burn fiercely.  It pounded down the mountain, rocked around curves and crossed dizzily high trestles that were beginning to smoulder, while back on the mountain the camp was going up in smoke.<br>
<br>
The little hamlet of Elsie, set almost in the middle of this gigantic destruction, was soon surrounded by the fire, and for twenty-four hours it was believed that Elsie and all it contained had been wiped away.  But through some quirk in the wind, Elsie survived.  Not so another hamlet, Lukarilla.  Settlers watched while Lukarilla, with its homes and barns a-nd fences and one store, disappeared entirely.  Strangely enough there was no loss of life here.<br>
<br>
Only one person died in all the fire, Frank Palmer, a CCC boy from Illinois, who was killed instantly when a big fir, uprooted by the wind, crushed him to earth.<br>
<br>
The blaze burned itself out on August 24, after a fog blanket drifted in from the coast to smother it.  In ten days it had killed twelve and one-half billion feet of fine timber.  It burned over some 310,000 acres.  How can one described twelve and one-half billion feet of timber? There is no use piling it up, in Sunday-supplement style beside the Empire State Building, which it would put in shadow many times over.<br>
<br>
But perhaps it will mean something to know that during the year 1932, twelve and one-half billion feet of logs was enough to supply the needs of all the sawmills, lath mills, shingle mills and pulpwood mills in the forty-eight states.<br>
<br>
Desolation is the word to fit the scene in Tillamook County following the fire-the Tillamook Burn, as it is called, covers an area half as large as Rhode Island.  No man who has stumbled through the thick ashes and over the blackened windfalls will forget it; the stark silhouettes of trees; the stumps and snags like sable tombstones; the acres as far as the eye can reach, all barren; the desolate silence, as though a cosmic hush has fallen over the stricken forest.<br>
<br>
This terrible quiet, as though all nature were brooding over the tragedy, will induce a mood hard for a man to shake off, especially so for a man who loves the forest, because he knows very well that a forest in its natural state is never quiet, never completely hushed.  In summer the noises, though often muted, are
obvious to the are the noises of countless beasts and birds going about their daily or nightly work of making a living.<br>
<br>
In winter, winds and frost add their bit of noise to that of the fauna still active such as the squeak of a wood mouse under the snow or the soft whissh of a hunting owl.<br>
<br>
That is why the utter silence of a burned forest fastens melancholy on a man-he knows that nothing lives in this stark area, no tree, no beast, no bird, and often no fish.  Gibbon sat amid the ruins of Rome and pondered the decline and fall of an entire civilization.<br>
<br>
Many a woodsman has sat on a blackened stump and pondered the destruction of an empire of forest with all it contained, wondering how many of its denizens escaped, how many tragedies of nest and burrow occurred.  Were the young grouse able to follow their frantic mother out of the strange danger?<br>
<br>
Did some doe warn its mottled fawn in time-and did they run in the right direction? Did any fire department of the woods run a ladder up to the fourteenth story of an old snag where some flickers were nesting? And what happened to the sly, lone fox, a-mousing in the swamp, when suddenly he found fire on all sides?<br>
<br>
Man was responsible for this devastation of an empire of timber.  And promptly man set out to salvage what he could.  Before the 1933 blaze had ceased to smolder, timber owners had formed a cooperative logging concern, and in the next dozen years had salvaged about one-third of the killed timber.<br>
<br>
It is perhaps necessary to explain that fire does not burn up completely such gigantic trees as those in the Tillamook forest; what it does is kill them, whereupon hordes of parasites immediately set to work to eat up or rot the dead but still standing timber.<br>
<br>
During the dozen years when salvage operations were going forward, nature was also taking a hand, trying to rectify the damage.<br>
<br>
The seed sources were many and they proved wonderfully fruitful; new growth sprang up and started to cover the ghastly scars, clothing the hills and valleys with new green.  By the middle of 1945 on many thousands of acres there was timber, new timber, as tall as a small house.<br>
<br>
I went over much of the Burn early in 1945 and was cheered by what I saw.  The forest already was tall and thick enough for a man to get lost in.  Birds had returned to the area.  So had animals, and
the elk and deer were numerous.<br>
<br>
Again the streams were clear and cold.  Many trout leaped in them.  Indeed, all was going well until a year ago, in 1945. What happened then compounded tragedy on tragedy, and a part of this new disaster probably stemmed from the war in the Pacific.  This was the manner of its coming:<br>
<br>
Early in the morning of July 9, 1945, a watchman on the Salmonberry River, in Tillamook County, roused to find the canyon beneath his station filled with smoke.  The sight gave him the creeps, and with good reason, for forest fires do not ordinarily start at such an hour, when humidity is high and the dew is heavy on trees and underbrush.<br>
<br>
The smoke appeared to have its source in an almost inaccessible spot, a high bluff across the canyon.  Many woodsmen thought then, and still think, that this fire was touched off by one of the Japanese incendiary balloons which had been falling in the Pacific Northwest since late in 1944.<br>
<br>
In any case it was fire.  The weather was ripe; humidity quickly fell as a wind like the breath of an open-hearth furnace swept down the Columbia River gorge and so on into Tillamook County.  Inside of two hours a great pillar of smoke, something like the one that rose here in 1933, had risen about four thousand feet.  I stood on a ridge twenty miles away that afternoon and watched the cloud grow dreadfully fast.  That night the whole horizon had a fitful red base.<br>
<br>
The fire burned on.  Two days later, as if planned by some horrible and efficient coordinator of forest fires, a second blaze broke out in Tillamook County, this time at Wilson River.  This one was not set by an incendiary balloon from across the Pacific but (probably) by the cigarette of an employee of a logging concern.  Twelve hundred men went to fight both fires.  Their efforts, like those of twelve years before, were as nothing.  The Salmonberry blaze and the one at Wilson River grew swiftly, and then, merging blew up into one great holocaust.<br>
<br>
It was 1933 all over again, only this time it was for the most part a new forest that was being destroyed; and this time it burned longer, for no heavy fog blanket came in from the coast to stop it.  The second Tillamook fire roared on through July, August, September and into October, covering an area of more than 150,000 acres, nearly all of it burned once before.<br>
<br>
What makes the Tillamook Burn so deeply tragic is that so much of
the area has undergone fire at least twice.  A once-burned forest will recover, for seed sources are left from the older trees.  But there is no hope for a forest burned a second time as thoroughly as this one was.<br>
<br>
The second time the flames took everything, including such seeds as were stored in the forest floor, and virtually all of the trees from which seeds might be expected to blow on the devastated acres.  Unless man were to take hold in a big way, nothing but weeds would grow here and even weeds would have a hard time of it in the burned-out soil.<br>
<br>
It is fortunate that Oregon has for its state forester a man who grew up in the Tillamook woods, a man who is more often in the woods than in his office.  Nelson Rogers is now facing the most gigantic job of reforestation any man has ever faced, for this vast and desolate region must be planted by hand, either with seeds or with young trees, or with both.<br>
<br>
Rogers is equal to the task, and long since he has had his young men at work, planting thousands of seedlings every day, making firebreaks and roads for protection and telling the state of Oregon he must have $750,000 a year for the next six years if the job is really to get going as it should.  His young men have invented two new tools that will speed the planting fivefold, and his entire department, loathing the Tillamook Burn as only foresters can, is working enthusiastically.<br>
<br>
But it will be many years before the Tillamook Burn will be anything more than a horrible example of what forest fires can do.<br>

THE YALCOT BURN OF 1903.<br>
<br>
Cheryl Daugherty, "The Yacolt Burn of 1903," <B>Clark County History, 1991.</B> Vancouver: Fort Vancouver Historical Society, 1991. p. 47-51. (excerpts).<br>
<br>
Land-clearing and farming were the principle occupations [of the settlers of the Yacolt Valley.]  Logging and sawmilling for the local trade was on a small scale. Forest fires were a way of life in the Pacific Northwest.  Nobody worried about them too much, because there were always more trees over the next hill.  But even the pioneers will remember September 12, 1902.<br>
<br>
On that day more than 110 forest fires from Eugene to Bellingham burned an estimated 700,000 acres and turned the sky black for hundreds of miles."<br>
<br>
One of these fires was to be known as the "Yacolt Burn," although the community of Yacolt itself was spared at the last minute when the wind suddenly shifted and died.  The fire, one of the greatest and most destructive in the nation's history, burned over more than 238,000 acres in Skamania, Clark and Cowlitz counties.  An estimated 12 billion board feet of timber was destroyed.<br>
<br>
There are vivid stories told by people who lived through the fire of 1902.  Perry W. Baker of Clark County told a story of a mother on Cedar Creek who took her four children into an underground cellar during the fire.  They smothered to death while less than 50 feet away stood a grove of green alders that survived the fire.<br>
<br>
One logger returned to Brown's logging camp on the north fork of the Washougal River to find the pigs left in camp were still standing in natural positions looking almost alive.  The intense heat had so quickly snuffed out their lives they didn't even fall over .<br>
<br>
For days the skies were dark, the ash fell a half inch thick on the town of Portland and there was fear throughout the Yacolt and surrounding area.  Many people thought the end of the world had come because the darkness made the day seem like night time.6 Immediately after the Yacolt burn, Weyerhaeuser made his first venture into Southwest Washington.  He moved into Yacolt to start salvaging timber from the burned forest."<br>
<br>
He established the Twin Falls Logging Company, named for a falls in Big Tree Creek.  The first Weyerhaeuser logging camp was on a 
<B>prairie </B>at the edge of Yacolt, and the first trees were felled
within sight of the city.  Hundreds of loggers worked in logging camps.  Weyerhaeuser had 15 camps over the years with at least 3 operating at one time with 100 men to the camp.<br>

<br>
The big wagon vibrated with the happy sounds of children headed for a picnic as it rolled upward toward Trout Lake on the western slope of Mount St. Helens, Washington.<br>
<br>
The time was September, 1902.  The day was hot but the air was crackling dry and not uncomfortable; the sun's glare was blunted by a blue-gray haze.  Smoke . . .<br>
<br>
The curtain which dimmed the distant view and blurred the scenic edges of the rugged land was plainly smoke but no one in the picnic party considered it worth mentioning.  After all, land clearing fires were common at summer's end.<br>
<br>
The wagon rattled along the rough road, climbing ever, closer to the softly-rounded snowcap of St. Helens, a cool, comforting ice cream cone in the sky.<br>
<br>
They had left the homestead on the north fork of the Lewis River in southwest Washington.  In the party were Mr. and Mrs. Ira Reid, Mr. and Mrs. C. A. McKeen and six children.  The picnic was in honor of Uncle George Smith, only recently arrived from distant Kansas.<br>
Uncle George was fated never to see Trout Lake.  Disaster struck with shocking suddenness about two miles above Yale postoffice.<br>
<br>
Like a tornado the gout of flame stormed down the gully, erupting in ear-splitting sound and fury as it raced toward the wagon, throwing exploding balls of fire in all directions.<br>
<br>
The horses reared, the men bellowed at them, the women and children screamed, and then quickly it was over and the angry dragon moved
on, reaching out again with its fiery tongue, destroying with its flaming breath the land and the creatures who lived upon the land.<br>
<br>
The Yacolt Burn, worst of the incredible forest fires of 1902, was scorching its way into history.<br>
<br>
Relatives of the families which perished near Yale, Charley Hartsuck and Charley Smith, reached Speelyai Creek a month later after chopping their way through down timber still smouldering in places.<br>
<br>
They examined the dismal spot with heavy hearts.<br>
<br>
Only blackened iron hoops marked the wagon location.  Eleven persons had died within 150 feet of the wagon.  The horses, unhitched before the fire struck, had done only a little better.  The goal of all the victims, human and animal, was Speelyai Creek.  The water was less than 100 yards away, but even that is too far when the enemy is a fire dragon galloping down a mountain draw.<br>
<br>
Not far away, the Newton Graves family watched the flames crash through the woods and ran for the safety of Speelyai Creek and the open ground of Speelyai Prairie.  Mrs. Graves delayed, said she would be along presently.<br>
<br>
She died for her Singer sewing machine and seve'ral jars of fruit.  They found her in the yard not far from the house, surrounded by the blackened remains of hef prized possessions.<br>
<br>
A star route mailman, W. E. Newhouse, should have had a better chance.  He owned two strong, fast horses and a sturdy buggy.  When he saw the fire storming toward his home, he quickly hitched up the animals to the mail bu-a and whipped them down the road at a wild clip.<br>
<br>
One horse had made a last, mighty jump onto a log felled beside the trail but the fire had leaped after.  This, at least, was the diagnosis of those who came on the scene a long time later.  Newhouse had left the buggy and sought refuge in a small gully.  There they found him, skin and clothes burned away, leaning against a log clutching a short piece of steel-the unburned core of his rattan whip.<br>
<br>
In the Dole district, a woman named Schmidt and her three children tried to hang onto life by clambering. into a cellar beneath their house.  It was a fatal mistake.  The house burned and fell in on the cellar, making o'f it a furnace hot enough to melt metal.<br>
Some along the Lewis River were luckier than others.  A fair number were able to reach Speelyai Prairie, a quarter mile wide and a half mile long, with "clover more'n two foot high," according to a
<br>
resident of the area.<br>
<br>
To  this  once-peaceful  meadow,  ahead   of   the   rampaging   flames,   came the creatures of the deep forest-men and women and children, cats and dogs, horses and cows.  Wild things, too.  All came running to this haven and waited there breathlessly with ancient animosities forgotten as the dragon stalked the hills around them.<br>
<br>
There was one farm on the prairie; it was owned by S. F. Murray.  By the morning of the next day, September 13, more than 40 refugees were at the Murray farm.  When there was no more room in the house, they slept in the barn and in the fields as the fire raged around them.<br>
<br>
At noon on the 13th, it was dark on Speelyai Prairie, dark as night.  The great rolling pall of smoke had stolen the light of day and fear pressed in through the gathering gloom.<br>
<br>
They stood in little groups and muttered and watched the animals come out of the woods-six bears, eight deer and a lynx.<br>
The humans stayed at Speelyai Prairie for four days.  The wild animals left after the second night.  The creatures lucky enough to reach the meadow in the woods had thwarted the dragon . . .<br>
<br>
So, too, had those who happened to be near Trout Lake when the enemy struck.  Farmers, prospectors, hunters and fishermen-60 or more -built fafts from fallen trees on the lakeshore and then literally began to paddle for their lives.  For two d ays and two nights they paddled to avoid the burning shores and survived.<br>
<br>
Unless one has experienced it, the effect of a great forest fire's smoke pall is hard to believe.  Sophus Jacobson, writing of a Mason County fire in September, 1902, said: '.'We fought ft day and night, and during the day the smoke was so heavy that we had to use lanterns to light our way.  There was really no difference in lighting between the day and the night, and it became confusing as to which was which."<br>
<br>
Describing the effect of the Yacolt Burn, Frank E. Barnes wrote: "The smoke darkened the sun, so that, althou gh we were fully one hundred miles distant, we had to use lights to run our mill and the chickens went to roost <B>in </B>daytime.  All day, leaves would come floating through the air and light on the lake.  When touched they dissolved into ashes.  Many people believed the world was coming to an end<br>
<br>

Allen Carter of Cowlitz County said: "The smoke was so bad one couldn't tell a man at arm's length -at 10 o'clock in the morning.  The headlight on the engine looked like the head of a match.  For three days the section hands couldn't take out the hand car.  Trains crawled in with mail only, hours'behind time.  Lights burned all day and that day is known as 'dark day.' "<br>
<br>
Throughout   Washington   minds   became    unhinged.    A    confused    woman ran down the smoky streets of Olympia and cried out, "Mount Tacoma is erupting!<br>
<br>
Near Woodland, some religious fanatics were in the throes of a camp meeting.  When the smoke blotted out the midday sun, they bellowed, "Glory be to God! The Last Days are at hand!<br>
<br>
Then they ran for their lives.<br>
<br>
A pioneer living at Stevenson wrote: "In 1902, we had a terrible forest fire aloqg here.  Many people were burned to death.  Many trees fell across the road and blocked the way. out.  We were hemmed in here and couldn't get out.  We'sat in our yard with our grips packed from Monday night until Saturday morning expeting every day to be burned to death.<br>
<br>
We laid on the ground most of the time and we kept the babies there all the time, because the only air one could breathe was next the ground.  The fire went in a semi-circle around this town (Stevenson) or we would all have died."<br>
<br>
The Yacolt Burn was, not the only forest fire of the period, by any means, but it climaxed a terrible series of conflagrations which had begun in August.  During the week prior to the Yacolt fire, blazes were touched off from up near Bellingham south to Eugene, Oregon.  Cinders floated down to coat Portland to a depth of half an inch.<br>
<br>
Twenty towns were erased by onrushing flames.  Hundreds of farmers and ranchers lost everything but considered themselves lucky to have survived.  The night sky bore the weird smearslof firelight produced by 700,000 acres of giant trees which were eaten away from the bottom up as flames raced through the thick jungle which had been allowed to <B>grow</B> on the forest floor.<br>
<br>
No doubt there were Indians on reservations during that terrible week who shook their heads sadly at the 'white man's stupidity.  When the Indians owned the woods, they burned the underbrush every autumn.  The fires scorched the big irees, but didn't hurt them since there wasn't enough fuel on the ground to develop great heat.<br>
<br>
When the Indians still owned the forest land, it was said, one could
ride a horse through the woods almost anywhere and really destructive forest fires were unknown.<br>
<br>
But the white man took over and in his wisdom, let the jungle develop on the forest floor.  Then at the end of the dry season, a spark from a locomotive and a hot wind out of the east could send <B>fife </B>of enormous heat blasting through the underbrush, igniting the great trees, leaving charred catastrophe in its wake.<br>
<br>
They called it the Yacolt Burn because Yacolt, with its 15 buildings, was then the metropolis of the region.  The residents of the town, on that fateful day in early September, saw the fires approaching over the hills to the south.<br>
<br>
Then the fire dragon galloped down the hill, heading straight for the town.  Paint began to blister on some of the buildings nearest the fire; the flames were still half a mile away but the heat was great enough to cause paint to run.<br>
<br>
Some of the old folks moaned that the end of the world was at hand, sure enough.  Then the entire population of Yacolt went-to a nearby creek and stayed there all night . . . and survived.<br>
<br>
In the morning they returned to their town and saw with wondering eyes that the fire had stopped short of the buildings.<br>
Near Yacolt at the foot of Tum-Tum Mountain, a homesteader heard a sound in the night and left his house to investigate.<br>
<br>
He later described a wild scene: "The whole range of hills back of Tum-Tum lighted up.  It was just like pressing a button and seeing the lights go on."<br>
<br>
The man was not a victim of a feverish imagination.  There had been another bad fire on those slopes in 1868; now the old, dry snags left by the earlier blaze had burst into flame even before the visible fire had reached them.<br>
<br>
Unless one has had the experience, it is not easy to imagine the awesome power, headlong speed and fantastic impact of a fire like the Yacolt Burn.  A graphic account of such a firestorm appeared in "Everybody's Magazine" in 1910:<br>
<br>
"The stillness of desolation rested above camps and towns where men by hundreds lived.  There was no carrying power in the air; sounds were muffled as if by a vacuum.  Bewildered birds fluttered through the smoky chaos, panting, lost.  Horses strained at their halters, looking upon their masters with questioning eyes, uncomforted by caresses, unassured by words.<br>
<br>
"If a beast, by a terrified lunge, broke its restraining tether, it
dashed away into the wilderness.  Even dooryard fowls here and there deserted their coops, seeking a refuge at the margin of some stream.  Dwellers in the woods and travellers on the dim trails saw forest creatures flying in one general direction, as if pursued by a force that struck a deeper terror than man.  The fear of man, indeed, seemed lost in them.  Scarcely would bear, mountain lion or deer lift their heads at sight of a man or move out of his path to let him pass.<br>
<br>
"A great tragedy was imminent in nature . . . there came at length a timid wind, sighing through the tree-walled canyons.  It struck hot upon the forehead, it burned dry upon the lips, ruffling the smoke mantle for a moment, soon to die away . . . It freshened steadily, rolling away the smoke, showing the sun red as iron under the smith's hammer, far down near the edge of the world.<br>
<br>
"That was all the warning the tempest of fire gave.  It was as if it indulged the oft-voiced desire of dying men to look once more upon the sun.  Out of the Northwest, over the mountains, it came.  Howling, roaring, the fires, but a few minutes before miles away, were upon the hamlets and camps, upon the lone cabins of settlers, leaping up the green mountain sides, streaming across canyons their long banners of obliterating flames . . .<br>
<br>
"It swept uphill and downhill with unabated speed, although a fire in a mountain country usually rushes up hillsides much faster than it burns down.  When the vanguard of the fire reached a canyon, it merely leaped across, no matter how wide the chasm.  In one known instance it leaped a mile . . . The flames caught the resinous foliage and long streamers of . . . moss with the hissing roar of great skyrockets.  In a breath, the proudest, oldest knights in this ancient guard of the mountains were stripped . . . their blackened trunks hurled to the ground by the tempest which drove the wild ocean of fire before it.<br>
<br>
"Living man has not witnessed a more appalling sight.  Days afterward men who went through it were struck dumb in their struggle for words to measure its horrors.  'The world was afire,' they said, 'the earth, the air, everything.' Lightning flashed out of the great clouds of smoke; incandescent flames, burning like carbon gas, sprang up, whistling their sharp notes above the roar of tempest and fire and the crash of falling trees, sprang up with nothing to feed on but air.  In the superheated atmosphere it appeared that all nature had become outlawed<br>
<br>
Almost everyone in the Pacific Northwest knew even before newspapers printed the ghastly stories that the Yacolt Burn was no ordinary fire.<br>
<br>

A former president of the University of Washington, Henry Schmitz, commented: "One of the most vivid memories of my childh@ is the utter darkness that fell on Seattle one late summer day in 1902 caused by the smoke of the Yacolt Burn.  There was darkness so complete that it necessitated lighting the city's gas street lights by early afternoon."<br>
<br>
As soon as the news of the disaster penetrated the Northwest, help began to flow into the stricken areas.  The Portland Oregonian of September 28, 1902, reported cash receipts of $9150; this amount, plus huge quantities of food and clothing, streamed across the Columbia from Portland and south from Seattle to Camas, Battleground, Lewis River and other burned-out communities.<br>
<br>
When the grim fire season of 1902 finally sputtered to a close, 110 fires in Oregon and Washington had burned over 700,000 acres, 239,000 in the Yacolt Burn itself.  As many as 45 persons may have died; the, exact figures will never be known.  The property loss in the two states was 13 millions of dollars.  A much greater loss w" the destruction of timber which some day would have reached market.<br>
<br>
The Yacolt Burn alone destroyed over 12 billion feet of timber and that timber was worth perhaps 20 million dollars to the owner of the stumpage; it is impossible to calculate how much more it would have been worth to the mill owners and the merchandisers of the finished wood products and to their employees in the form of payrolls.<br>
<br>
Four years after the Yacolt Burn, the Washington state legislature provided for a state board of forest commissioners with power to appoint a fire warden and deputies.<br>
<br>
Uncowed, the fire dragon wasn't through with his wild rambles through the Yacolt Burn.  In 1929, much of the same area burned again.  As a result, there are parts of the area which are still without substantial regrowth.  Each successive fire left more of the dead, dry snags which are little more than tinder.  In 1929, 187,000 acres burned over in two days; 80,000 acres were second growth.<br>
<br>
Still, nothing of importance was done to prevent future holocausts until the Tillamook Burn flared in northwest Oregon in 1933, eating up as much lumber as had been used throughout the U.S. during the previous year!<br>
<br>
Public sentiment crystallized as aroused citizens finally realized that the great forests cool, majestic retreats for man and animal and one of the richest sources of payrolls in the Northwest-were doomed unless drastic action could be taken soon enough.
A drive to educate the public was needed.  In 1940, the Keep Wash-
ington Green movement was kicked off ; Oregon soon started a similar organization.  Fire losses began to drop. Fire fighting practices were studied and improved.  Modern technology was put to work.  Helicopters, radio, smoke jumpers, retardant chemicals dropped in great colored clouds from low-flying bombers-all were tried and given a part to play in the fight against the fires of the future.<br>

<br>
THE YALCOT BURN.<br>
<br>
Stewart Holbrook, "The Yalcot Burn," <B>The Columbia.</B> New York: Rinehart and Company, 1956, p. 220-221.<br>
<br>
A majority of the fires west of the Cascades have occurred in the fall.  On September 17, 1902, a country correspondent for the Weekly <B>Columbian</B> <B>Vancouver</B> sat down at an ash-covered table in Kalama to report one of the worst to date, a disaster of whose size even he, close to the center of it, bad little idea.  Who he was I have no idea, but he had a keen sense of tragedy in his soul, and was thus something of a poet.  His pencil moved across the sheet of paper and he wrote his lead:<br>
<br>
What a week ago was the beautiful valley of the Lewis River is now a hot and silent valley of death, spotted with the blackened bodies of both man and beast. . . .<br>
<br>
He did not exaggerate.  The North Fork of the Lewis, a river that enters the Columbia at Woodland, bad been hit hardest of all; and now that a wan sun could penetrate the smoke which had covered much of western Washington and Oregon for a week, as well as the sea for many miles offshore, it was becoming apparent that a major disaster had taken place.<br>
<br>
Though it went into history as the Yacolt Fire, it was really a series of the most terrible forest fires white men had seen west of the mountains.  Thirty-five people had been burned to death.<br>
<br>
Perhaps as many as  fifty hamlets or villages had been destroyed or partially burned.  Farmers and stump-ranchers by the hundreds bad lost everything except their lives.  Cinders fell to cover Portland half an inch deep, and the same was true of Bellingham and Seattle, and other places all the way down the map to the head of the Willamette Valley at Eugene.
This monstrous fire or fires covered some 700,000 acres and was a sight to put fear into the stoutest heart and bring total distraction to weak or susceptible minds.  In the murky streets of Olympia a disheveled woman ran and screamed that Mount Tacoma was in eruption.  At a camp meeting near Woodland religious fanatics cried, "Glory to God, the Last Days have come," just before they had to run<br>
for their lives.<br>
<br>
During the awful week, and while much of Clark County was burning on the north bank of the Columbia, fire leaped up in the timber near Bridal Veil on the Oregon side.  It spread rapidly to destroy a big planing mill on the river's very edge, razed the village of Palmer back in the hills, and swept through thousands of acres of fine tall green timber.<br>
<br>
One should bear in mind that this was not brush burning-but timber often taller than Bunker Hill Monument, which is a mere 220 feet high.  The captain of the Bailey Gatzert reported that he was compelled to use his searchlight to navigate the river at noon.<br>
<br>
The worst scars of the fires of 1902 are still to be seen on the Yacolt Burn.  The fires prompted Washington to provide for a state forester and a chief fire warden.  Oregon acted to create a board of forestry.  These modest steps did little toward preventing fires or controlling them.  That bad to wait for <B>1910 </B>when a bigger and deadlier fire aroused national interest.<br>

1902 YACOLT FIRE<br>
<br>
Jim Attwell, "The 1902 Yalcot Fire," <B>Columbia River Gorge History,</B> Skamania, Washington: Tahlkie Books, 1975, II, p. 202-205.<br>
<br>
Several stories have been told of how this great fire started; one that lightning set the first fire, but others tell that it was a man or boy started.  An old settler says that two young boys at Bonneville started the holocaust while trying to burn out a yellow jackets nest; another old timer says that it was a steamboat crew that was loading wood aboard for fuel near Eagle Creek.<br>
<br>
Yellow Jackets with a nest close to the wood pile, considered it their wood, or at least their territory, so they set their stingers into several of the workers, who in turn started a fire around the hostile nest hoping to burn them out.  The grass and brush was dry and the fire soon got out of hand with a stiff wind behind it.
The fire swept into the timber covered mountain, destroying everything in its path, creating disaster at Bridal Veil.  Racing to the top of the mountains back of Cascade Locks, the terrific drafts caused by the great heat, uprooted burning trees, hurling them a thousand feet into the air, carrying them across the Columbia and starting fires on the north bank in Washington.<br>
<br>
Frank Richards told, "The 1902 Yacolt Burn Fire burned around north of Stevenson.  It was so smokey around the Richards' place that we had to take blankets down to the creek and wet them, take sticks and make like tents of wet blankets, and then crawl under them so we could breathe."<br>
<br>
Phoebe Lindsay Yoe tells, "We were living at Cascade Locks and my parents decided to take us to The Dalles on a steamboat.  The boat crew had to keep pumps running and spray water over the steamboat while going up the center of the river as burning limbs and wood were falling down on the steamer."<br>
<br>
There were no telephones in this area and the air was so full of smoke that you couldn't see the sun, so no one knew just how far the fire had reached.  The skies were so darkened with the heavy smoke that the chickens went to roost at noon.  Ashes fell like snow flakes, only they were hot and light.<br>
<br>
Many homesteaders were wiped out, leaving their homes and racing to streams, immersing in the water.  The fire would race up a mountain and jump across a canyon, trapping wild animals and people alike.  The forest in the fire's path was virgin timber with trees 500 years old and 6 feet in diameter and often 200 feet high.<br>
<br>
One can not picture the tremendous damage done by a forest fire of this caliber unless you were there.   The heat is so great that green giant fir trees will explode as if blasted apart with dynamite from the sudden steam pressure built up inside the carcass and with loud reports like gunfire.<br>
<br>
The wind draft is so great from the tremendous heat that burning trees will be carried upward several hundred feet above the mountain tops, rock mountains will have their faces molten.  Deer, as fast as they are, can not outrun this kind of fire.<br>
<br>
Families loaded wagons and started leaving many areas, soon hearing the roar of the fire overtaking them, they hastily turned the<br>
horses loose and ran to the nearest creek and covered themselves with wet blankets.<br>
<br>
A creek bed was the only place left to go, the creek often had worn a small canyon for its creek bed, and often alder or willows grew along its banks and they remained green the year around and did not
readily burn from falling embers.  Some might get a little sleep while others stayed awake, but all had sore eyes from the smoke.<br>
<br>
Thirty-eight bodies were found in Lewis River alone; up Wind River pitiful evidence was found among the ashes of fallen timber blocking the only road, nine charred bodies along with harness buckles, iron from wagons attested the fate of the unlucky party.<br>
<br>
One half million acres of timber ravaged by the fire.  The holocaust was first called the Yacolt-Cispus Burn but now known as the Yacolt Burn.  It is said, "Besides destroying water sheds, that the timber loss has amounted to $10 million each year in timber production."<br>
Natural Resources now have taken action to prevent future great fires.  Ken Herman, Bill Baxter, Frank Murphy and others with<br>
crews of honor camp's prisoners have fallen snags.<br>
<br>
The Larch Mountain crews have fallen 19,200 snags and the Washougal crews, 21,135 snags, planted 3,608,875 young trees by the end of 1967.  They have built fire roads zig-zagging through the Yacolt Burn area and are still continuing this good work while also rehabilitating prisoners into a better way of life.<br>

The Vanport Flood<br>
<br>
by Judy Walters<br>
<br>
VANPORT FLOOD.<br>
<br>
Judy Walters, "The Vanport Flood," <B>Clark County History.</B> XXXI (1990) p. 71-77.<br>
<br>
Memorial Day, May 30,1948 at about 4:00 p.m. disaster struck the city of Vanport.  Vanport, a wartime housing project containing 18,500 residents and the second largest city in,Oregon, was completely destroyed by flooding waters after the dike broke leaving nothing but memories of a city that was.<br>
<br>
The city of Vanport was the first largest wartime housing project in the nation for the war workers.  The Kaiser Foundation started the project and it was later taken over by the Portland Housing Authority.  It was completed in September, 1943.'<br>
<br>
The construction of this instant city was a rush job as was everything connected with the war effort and poor quality materials were used.  A Congressional investigating committee faulted the quality of the construction of the project and of the public services.'<br>
<br>
Vanport was a city that housed people of all races.  The blacks, who were a significant percentage of the residents, had their own assigned areas.  The stores, churches and other facilities, however, were available to everyone regardless of race.  The housing pro'ect residents were mostly employees of the shipyards.  The shipyards ran three shifts, twenty-four hours a day and women comprised many of the employees.  Day cares and schools ran long hours to accommodate the working parents.  The families often only saw each other on weekends.<br>
<br>
Vanport was a place to survive, barely, as life was not easy for its residents.  They had to contend with racial differences, little family life, poorly built homes, very little material values and long, hard working hours at the shipyards.<br>
<br>
This hardworking community was to exist only for a few short years.  It was constructed swiftly and was completely destroyed in a matter of a few minutes.<br>
<br>

A railroad fill, which served as part of the protective dike system, failed and within minutes the gap in the dike had @dened to about 600 feet.  After 2 hours, 10 to 20 feet of debris-laden water completely inundated Vanport destroying all the blilldings.  Most people fled on foot because over 400 stalled automobiies jammed traffic at the exits of the community.<br>
<br>
Most residents were unable to to salvage even small household effects, and rescue workers had to lift some people from the roofs of floating apartment buildings.  The destructive flood caused an almost total loss of public and private property and killed 15 people.  Had the tragedy occurred at night or during a weekday, loss of life would probably have been much higher.<br>
<br>
The entire dike system, including the railroad fill that eventually failed had been repeatedly inspected for 6 days prior to the breach.  A Division Engineer telegraphed to the Chief of Engineers that "the situation appeared at all times to be quite favorable and under full control by those charged with the responsibility for maintenance of the flood protection project."<br>
<br>
On May 31 a crew foreman noticed a crack in the fill and called for a Corps inspector and while examining it "the entire section seemed to disappear at once and both foreman and inspector had to run for their lives.'<br>
<br>
Weather conditions from the above normal temperatures in late spring, heavy precipitatation in the last half of May, combined with a heavy snow pack, sent a tremendous volume of water pouring off the mountains into the streams and rivers which feed into the Columbia.6<br>
Water had risen to 26.7 at Vancouver on May 29, and meterologists predicted it would rise four more feet, which would be two feet over the top of the local levees.'<br>
<br>
The Vancouver Columbian newspaper's front page on May 3 1, 1948 spelled out these words in large, bold type, "3 1 -Foot Crest Tuesday; New Breaks Feared; Ruins Probed." The day's newspaper was filled with writing and pictures of the catastrophe.<br>
<br>
A front page news report added, "Another dike was threatening to break today under the raging flood that destroye.@ this town of 18,700 people yesterday as completely as a mashed toy village.  Everyone, except rescue workers hunting'bodies in the shattered town, was ordered out of the area to avoid being caught in a second break."<br>
<br>
The prearranged siren signal for the residents was sounded within minutes as a 6 foot wall of water swept into the city.  Hundreds heard the warning but since earlier reports had said they were in
no imminent danger, they ignored the danger at first.  They were told that plenty of warning would be given if the "dike" was threatened.<br>
<br>
The advice was on mimeographed sheets distributed by the Portland Housing Authority.  The U.S. Army Engineers advised Saturday night that no north Portland dikes were seriously endangered.  There were some that did not hear the warning horns and sirens.  Many residents refusing to leave their homes were forced by police officers with drawn guns.  One officer said, "The people just didn't believe that there would be a break; they wanted to see the water first before fleeing their homes.  Many stopped to pack belongings or aid neighbors."<br>
<br>
Rescue workers reported seeing many men in small power boats breaking into second story windows after the water had Submerged the lower floors.<br>
<br>
A deputy sheriff said he saw four persons in a car being crushed Linder a floating building and many persons said they saw clilldren being swept away, yet there were just a few accounts of possi 'ble flood victims the next morning.  Another witness toldof " watching men cry as they saw a man trying to climb up the side of the house, lose his footing and was hit by a log and disappeared."ll<br>
<br>
At least one hundred fifty cars, trucks and buses were Submerged according to other witnesses.  A local businessman told of trying to salvage some of his store's stock in his truck and realized the flood was worse than he had believed.  His words "life, not property was the question" were well echoed.  He went on to say "I saw several fear-crazed people who were hurt by the cars, we helped those that we could onto our truck which was never more than 50 or 100 feet ahead of oncoming muddy waves that spashed 20 or 30 feet as it hit and crumpled the buildings.  I saw dozens of people overtaken and thrown down by the wave."<br>
<br>
Vancouver was cut off from train and mail service.  The Interstate Bridge was closed to all but emergency traffic.  Industrial plants were closed down with the exception of Alcoa.  Alcoa, completely surrounded by water, protected by sand dikes, kept employees working regular shifts by ferrying the workers of the aluminum plant in and out by boat.<br>
<br>
The Red Cross made 10,000 cots and blankets available and gave food and clothing when necessary, to the victims brought to temporary rehabilitation centers by buses, trucks and private cars.  I I<br>
Survivors of the Vanport flood recall their experiences on that unforgetable Memorial Day.<br>
<br>
Laura Brumfield, was only two years old at the time the flood<br>
hit.  She recalls she lost all her red hair and quit talking as she  was so frightened.
<br>
Laura's mother told her of having the*r ant*que s*lver tea set stolen except for a couple of pieces that had fallen from the shelf and were buried by the mud.<br>
<br>
Sandi Johnson, a girl of five years when her family was caught in the disaster told of being driven to a safer place by a family friend, Red, in his convertible.  While enroute to higher and safer ground, a man stopped their car and was screaming at Red to take his kids with them.<br>
<br>
The car was already full: the man begged so desperately, Red agreed.  She remembers there were about six children and each one of them had either a kitten or a toy in hand.<br>
<br>
The older children rode on the bumpers and the younger ones sat on laps in Red's already crammed car.  Red took them to a hill<br>
where they were taken by bus to a Red Cross center in Vancouver.<br>
<br>
"We were separated from our Mom and Dad for a couple of days which seemed forever." Sandi had just recovered from having the mumps and 
her older brother, Tom, had them at the time.  The <B>two </B>of them went to live with relatives in Vernonia, Oregon, while her younger sister and brother were with her parents at another relative's house.  It was about a month before they were united.<br>
<br>
Sandi summed it up with these moving words, "We lost everything but had nothing really."<br>
<br>
Sandi's father, Walter Wooldridge, was working at the slilpyards and gave his story of the flood's affect on him and his family.  "Me and some of the guys were out having a few beers when the dike broke." He said some of the men couldn't get their cars started.  His wife and children were separated from him.<br>
<br>
"Pearl went to St. Johns and I had a hell of a time finding her." When he went back to their apartment, they were on a second floor, all he could see on the wall were the nails that had held his new 33 rifle.  It was stolen along with their radio and other small personal items.  He remembered seeing a lot of sheriffs watching for looters.  Wally told of a brand new refrigerator that was ruined from water.  He salvaged it, had it repaired and has it in his garage today, saying of it, "It doesn't work too good; it runs all the time.""<br>
<br>
Wally and his family's episodes of that eventful day were probably a typical scene for most of the families in the city of Vanport.  Torn away from thelrh@omes and lovedones; they were sometimes unaware of each other's whereabouts for days.<br>
<br>
Charles Bellinger, retiree of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, was
attending classes at Vanport College where most of the students were veterans.  After the flood, the college moved to St. Johns then to Lincoln High School and finally downtown Portland where it is today, and, is now Portland State Universtiy.  The college was closed for the Memorial Day holiday so many of the students had left for their break, which Charles feels, saved a lot of of lives.<br>
<br>
His account of the reason for the dike failing was very informative.  "Reason dike failed is the railroad fill had been  a trestle.  The trestle was too old so they dumped material over the side and buried the trestle as it was.  The old trestle rotted out 
in the railroad fill and water seeped in the fill and it was super saturdated with water and became mushy and pressure from the water blew it out and caused it to fail."<br>
<br>
Shirley Bellinger, as well as her husband, remember certain incidents from that day.  Shirley was attending Vancouver H'gh School.  That Sunday was Baccalaureate for her graduating class of '48.  A fellow student, who was living with her sister at Vanport and attending Vancouver High School, told Shirley she was in the midst of ironing her cap and gown when the flood hit and she ran out of the house with the iron in one hand and her cap and gown the other.<br>
<br>
After graduation the graduates couldn't go anywhere to celebrate as it was a state of emergency. To the north Woodland was being flooded and to the south Portland was closed.  Since there was no television coverage, news was received by word of mouth, newspapers or by first hand citing.<br>
<br>
An interview with Lorraine Gemmel, a resident of Vancouver since 1927, tells of her dilemma while being pregnant at the time of the flood.  Lorraine and her husband were visiting friends in John Day, Oregon.<br>
<br>
On their return trip back home to Vancouver, they were stranded in Portland and had to stay in a hotel for one week.  They finally crossed over the Bridge of the Gods to return to the Washington side and home.  Lorraine said emphatically, "It was a miracle more people were not killed.  The only road to Portland from Vancouver was Denver Avenue and it was washed out.  Some people used helicopters or private boats, which were very few in those days, to leave the area."<br>
<br>
An article in the June 2, 1948 Columbian "Confidence Unlimited" summed up "the isolation we have experienced could hardly have been more complete had we been the center of an enemy bombing mission.  Lack of all types of communications, railroads, highways and wires

has made this community an <B>entity</B> unto itself.  And, thrown on our own resources, we haven't done too bad, either.""<br>

FLOOD OF 1948.<br>
<br>
Gordon Newell, "Maritime events of 1948," H.W.McCurdy Marine History of the Pacific Northwest. Seattle :Superior Publishing Company, 1966., p. 555-56.<br>
<br>
Flood waters on the Columbia River early in the year caused a number of marine accidents.  The Western Transportation Company's stern -wheel steam towboat Claire struck a submerged object in Camas Slough about three miles below Camas and immediately sank, her crew being removed safely by the company's steamer Jean.  The Claire was later raised.  A 500-foot escort carrier, moored at the Zidell Ship Dismantling dock, was torn from her moorings by an out of-control log raft and swept down the Willamette River at Portland toward the closed Hawthorne Bridge.<br>
<br>
The runaway carrier was sighted by the crew of the veteran 93-foot Knappton Towboat Co. tug  Melville (recently converted from 220-horsepower steam to 440-horsepower diesel engines), and Capt.  Earl Weir immediately ordered a pursuit of the carrier.<br>
<br>
After a dangerous and difficult feat of securing a line to the drifting hulk, it was landed and secured a short distance above the bridge.  Had the rescue operation been delayed another five minutes the bridge would have been demolished.<br>
<br>
The stern-wheeler Georgia Burton delivered to The Dalles the previous year for use as a river boat museum, had lain neglected at the lower end of the Celilo Canal.  Flood water came over the canal wall, floated the steamer over the wall and onto the rocks outside, where she broke her back and became a total loss.

HEPPNER, OREGON FLOOD.<br>
<br>
Stewart Holbrook, "Disaster in June," <B>Wildmen, wobblies and whistler punks.</B> Corvallis: Oregon State University Press, 1992, p. 244-253.<br>
<br>
It had been a long sweltering day, the 14th of June, 1903.  The sun traveled across the Oregon sky in a steady blaze that shriveled the wheat and sent thousands of sheep to find such shade as they could in the creek bottoms.  Since dawn the windmills on the ranches had stood motionless.  Heat blurred the vision as it shimmered in waves up and down and across the sides of the barns.<br>
<br>
It was even worse in the village of Heppner, county seat and trading center of a vast sheep-and-wheat region.  Set in a narrow valley along tiny Willow Creek, Heppner was hemmed by stark hills.  Not a breath of air moved all that interminable Sunday.  Tar oozed from the seams of papered shacks.  Clapboards curled on the better homes.  Dogs slunk under porches and panted.  The children couldn't go swimming, for there wasn't enough water in Willow Creek to cover their knees.<br>
<br>
But four o'clock brought welcome signs of relief.  The sun abruptly disappeared.  A breeze came up, fitful yet strong.  The sky turned gray, then black.  Heppner people began to feel better.  They could tell that a cooling shower was about to break the hot spell, just as hot spells had been broken time out of mind.<br>
<br>
A few big drops of rain splattered the parched roofs.  The leaves of the cottonwoods along the creek rustled nervously, and turned the rising wind.  Then the sky, as black now as midnight, was split by a bolt, followed by thunder that sounded in the close valley like the crack of doom.  And the rain came down.<br>
<br>
Heppner folks were used to quick, violent storms.  This one seemed to be particularly violent.  Water poured down in volume such as the oldest inhabitants had never seen.  Hail came intermittently, but so thickly it began to pile up in dooryards like so much snow.  The valley and the village were lighted every few moments by savage flashes in the dark sky.<br>
<br>
Thunder rolled in continuous volleys.  It was a wonderfully exciting time for the youngsters.  They stood at windows and saw Willow Creek rising as they watched.  Fathers and mothers were unworried.  The creek might fill its banks.  It might overflow.  It had done so in the past.  But there could be no danger.  There were no dams upstream to give way, either on Willow Creek or on Balm Fork, which joined the creek just above town.<br>
<br>
The cloudburst continued for perhaps twenty minutes, and with it the hail, the wind, the thunder and lightning.  Then the clatter of the tormented elements was wholly lost in a new and sudden roaring.  It
wasn't a noise that grew.  It was a noise both mighty and full-blown when it struck the ear, and it brought men up out of their chairs and women out of their kitchens.<br>
<br>
This strange and new noise was the meeting, just above the village, of two monstrous great torrents rolling down Balm Fork and the main creek, merging into one thunderous wave of water bearing trees, ranch houses ' barns, horned cattle, sheep, fences, and baled hay.  The two torrents made one flood, not of Old Testament size, but sufficient to wipe out the village of Heppner.<br>
<br>
The new steam laundry, filled with heavy machinery, held out for a few minutes, long enough to dam the waters twenty feet deep a-nd long enough for a few people to see what was upon them and to start running.  Then the dam gave way, loosing the rush of a lake into the streets.  Carrying children, a few of the running men managed to got out from under; but not many of the women.  Skirts were long in 1903, and the muddy water quickly made them unbearably heavy.  The women sagged, stumbled, then disappeared.<br>
<br>
George Conser, cashier of the town bank, and his wife were at home.  They heard the noise. just then the first tremendous wave struck.  The windows and doors caved in.  The Consers started upstairs, water at their heels.  The whole house groaned.  It wrenched.  It reeled, and then its lower portion collapsed.  Away went the Consers in their ark of an upper story.<br>
<br>
August Lundell had an instant in which to run out of his house and to climb a big cottonwood tree, dragging two youngsters with him. just then the Lundell house caught the full force of the wave.  It left its foundations, keeled over, and came rolling past, Mrs. Lundell clinging to the top side.  Her husband reached out and caught her, like a sack of mail at a way station, pulling her into the God-given tree, where the Lundell family lived it out while Heppner was being destroyed.<br>
<br>
At the fine Palace Hotel, three stories of staunch brick, Mrs. Phil Metchan, wife of the owner, who was absent, saw her two Japanese houseboys run out of the hotel toward the flood, a block away.  She couldn't tell which way the flood was going to move next, nor how fast.  She picked up Dorothy, her two-year-old, and ran for the nearest hill.  Back at the hotel the waters were already trickling into the cellar.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, the two Japanese lads were performing heroically in pulling women and children from the water and debris; and one of them gave his life in the effort.<br>

Now the wallowing houses, the cattle, the sheep, the mud, hail, and human beings were being piled up in a hideous jam against a row of stout trees; and another dam was formed, to hold just long enough to make and loose a second lake.  It struck the little hand laundry and ground it instantly into a mass of kindling, killing the seven or eight poor Chinese within.<br>
<br>
Then the wave went on to leap at the Mallory home, picking it up entire, with Gus Mallory, postmaster, bedridden in a-n upper story, and sent it on a careening voyage halfway across the village, to come to rest on Main Street, facing the front doors of the Belvedere saloon.<br>
<br>
In the Belvedere a quiet poker game had been in progress; and between interest in the cards and the terrific din of the storm the players did not know that Heppner was already under water.  Then the flood hit Main Street.  Frank Roberts, owner of the Belvedere, ran out to look for his family.<br>
<br>
The other players left too, and old Dick Neville, Civil War veteran and bartender, waved them on their way.  "I'll stay with her till she floats," he cried, and turned down another jolt.<br>
<br>
At the Heppner railroad station Agent Kernan and family got a look at what was coming from the upper part of town.  They ran for the hills.  Kernan, however, had forgotten something, but whatever it was, it was scarcely worth the effort, for when he emerged from the depot this time, Time had caught up.  The rush of water tore him off his legs and whirled him into the dreadful hodgepodge of bodies, timbers, and other debris.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, two young men of Heppner had set out on a heroic mission.  They were Leslie Matlock and Bruce Kelley.  They saw the first big wave when the steam laundry gave way.  They knew it was too late to do much for Heppner.  It might even be too late to warn the hamlet of Lexington, ten miles down Willow Creek, and the hamlet of lone, eight miles beyond Lexington.<br>
<br>
But a man, two men, could try. While Kelley hurried to get horses at the one livery stable not in the path of the waters, Matlock ran to Bisbee's hardware store for wire cutters.  They would have to ride overland, and between Heppner and the lower villages were fence after fence of taut, well strung barbed wire.  The store was locked.  Matlock kicked in the door, got two pairs of cutters, then ran for the stable.  He and Kelley mounted and took off, heading over the big bare hills in order to get out of the Willow Creek Valley, now running high and fast with damnation.<br>
<br>
It was tough going, overland.  All downhill or uphill, and no road.  Dark, too.  Every half-mile or less was a fence to be cut, a
dangerous business, with the sky flashing and every strand of wire potentially an electrode, ready to burn a man to a crisp.  And down came the rain, while the great hailstones beat and frightened the horses.<br>
<br>
The animals responded well for speed, but they were hard to manage at the fences; and the cutting took time true, only a few seconds here and a few seconds there, but they began to add up when racing a flood tearing hell-bent down Willow Creek.  The two riders came in sight of Lexington to find that the waters were going to beat them by about two minutes; but no lives were lost, though several houses were destroyed.<br>
<br>
At Lexington the waters were damming up just as the two horsemen pounded past on the hillside above the settlement.  "We can beat her to Ione," Matlock yelled to Kelley.  On they went.<br>
<br>
There were more fences to cut.  Both animals were tiring.  The riders urged, praised, cajoled, demanded, using every trick known to experienced horsemen.  The animals responded, too, and presently came galloping into tiny and unsuspecting lone.  Matlock looked over his shoulder to see what Willow Creek looked like down here.  It was bankfull, swift, mean looking <B> </B>but the Flood hadn't come yet. it wasn't in sight.<br>
<br>
The sudden appearance in the hamlet of two men on wind-blown horses brought people running out of their houses.  "Get to the hills!" Matlock cried.  Ione's total population went into action.  Driving such stock as they had at home, and carrying such household treasures as they could, they moved to the hills on either side of the settlement.  The flood waters hit the village within minutes after the horsemen arrived, but not a life was lost.<br>
<br>
Back in tragic Heppner the worst had happened.  Within half an hour-some said twenty minutes-after the steam laundry dam gave way, the flood had thundered and boiled through town, and the waters had receded until they no more than filled the banks of Willow Creek.  It had been as quick as that.<br>
<br>
The worst was bad enough.  When Phil Metchan rode into the stricken village early next morning, he saw a sight he recalled vividly almost fifty years later.  It was a big, long two-horse farm wagon moving slowly up Main Street to one of the several emergency morgues.  On it were bodies piled one upon another, twenty, thirty of them, with the long mud matted hair of women hanging out over the wheels.<br>
<br>
All over Heppner Death was moving in somber processions, riding in wagons, carts, hay ricks, even in rubber-tired buggies.<br>
Here and there, like the Palace Hotel, a few buildings still stood-the Odd Fellows Block, the courthouse, the Fair Store, and the
<br>
Belvedere saloon and its upstairs Opera House.  The latter structure's two big floors were covered now with bodies laid out under blankets and pieces of canvas.<br>
<br>
In between these few larger buildings was the ghastly debris of the deluge-the barns and houses that had become mere piles of jackstraws in which searchers looked for, and found, still more bodies.  Before night two companies of Oregon militia had moved in to help.<br>
<br>
All - day and all night, by the light of flaming torches and dim farm lanterns, an army of men dug graves while another army of carpenters sawed and hammered to make coffins.  Many would be needed.  The death count rose steadily throughout the day: 180 at noon, then 200, and finally 225 bodies were recovered, among them that of the brave Japanese lad who had lost his life in saving others. (In 1951 his was the only Japanese grave in Heppner Cem-
etery, and a granite marker tells of his courageous deed.)<br>
<br>
Two hundred and twenty-five people had died in Heppner between half-past four and five o'clock.  Nearly all were killed, not by drowning but by the dreadful battering.  The number of dead amounted to nearly one-quarter of the population, for Heppner's wildest booster in 1903 claimed no more than 1,100 citizens, men, women, and children.  Not even the larger and far more celebrated Johnstown Flood took so proportionately great a number of inhabitants.<br>
<br>
Heppner in mid-century is still a small place, little larger than in the times of its Deluge.  Old survivors walked with me over the site of the disaster, pointing out where the Conser house had stood, and the site of the steam laundry that had held to form the first fatal dam. (Other survivors say it was a small hospital building and not the laundry which made the dam.)<br>
<br>
They showed me where the Lundell home had stood, the house that became an ark.  The Mallory house yet stands.  So does the stone building that contained the Belvedere saloon and the upstairs Opera House.  This is now a drugstore, with apartments above.  Old-timers said that neither saloon nor opera house could survive their use as morgues; the association in the minds of townspeople could be dissipated neither by alcohol nor by dramatic and musical art.<br>
<br>
Heppner's local history naturally divides into two periods; one before, one after the Flood.  Still among living survivors of that tragic day is Leslie Matlock, now a patriarch, pointed out to strangers, and most properly so, as the Heppner Paul Revere, the man who rode out the Flood on horseback.<br>
<br>
It required some persuasion to get him to tell me of the ride, about which he was modest.  When walking the streets, however, the old hero is likely to be carrying a gold-headed cane, on the brightly burnished head of which is an inscription, dim but still legible:
"Leslie Matlock, Presented by the People of lone in grateful remembrance of Heroic Ride during Flood at Heppner, June 14, 1903.  " (The late Bruce Kelley got a cane too.)<br>
<br>
The flood and the ride made a front-page item in the press all over the country.  Young Kelley and Matlock received telegrams from two circus outfits, offering them featured jobs.  They declined.  Heppner went promptly to work to clear the flood damage, then to rebuild along the banks of Willow Creek as before, and to carry on as a trading center and rail-shipping point for sheep and wheat.<br>
<br>
When I was there last, I stood and looked long at the creek where it enters the village, trying to imagine how this piddling stream could have desolated even so small a place as Heppner, and filled a graveyard.  In places the water was perhaps six feet across, never more than ten feet, and very shallow.  Survivor Frank Roberts was with me.  "It was the damming up behind the steam laundry that did it," he said.  "When she let go-well, that's all there was to it."<br>
<br>
In June, each year, the Heppner Gazette-Times runs a reminder of the Flood; but the event is little remembered outside of Morrow County, whose somewhat weird courthouse stands on a hillside at Heppner.  An alleged event concerning the town clock in this structure is proof of the wondrous magic worked by Time on what men like to think are their memories.  It is worth setting down here in some detail, for what we are obviously dealing with is that threshold over which fact passes to turn instantly into fancy.<br>
<br>
It is the threshold of the imagination which processes some dull or meaningless item to bring it into accord with the love of the marvelous.  It is the threshold to the manufacture of myths often called folklore.<br>
<br>
No piece of folklore is more immune than that a watch or a clock stopped miraculously at some particular moment of great drama.  In sober accounts of events, no less than in fiction, we have a timepiece stopping at the instant of some eminent man's death, often miles away; or stopping at the very moment of some tragic or historic event, as so many Southern clocks did when General Lee gave his sword to General Grant.  It is the same romantic notion so immortally ensconced in the verses, "It stopped short-never to go again-when the Old Man died."<br>
<br>
Well, that was exactly what happened to the town clock in the courthouse tower at Heppner, according to several residents; its hands had halted at half-past four on the afternoon of June 14, 1903.  I had fully expected this piece of misinformation, for I had been exposed to a good deal of similar folklore.  And so, when I carne to contribute an article on the Heppner flood to the
Oregonian, I mentioned that the stoppage could hardly have occurred, because the works of the clock had not then been installed.  I got this information, I think, from the late Phil Metchan, already mentioned in this chapter.<br>
<br>
Letters of protest and abuse rolled in from flood survivors living in all parts of the Northwest.  Many were heated, several almost incoherent.  The writers termed my article fiction.  What the writers meant, of course, was that my account, based on careful research, did not jibe with their memories of what had happened forty-seven years previously.<br>
<br>
It is most instructive that no two letters quite agreed on the clock or anything else concerning the day of the Flood, except that there was a town clock.  Two correspondents remembered that the clock stopped "at 4:15." Others held that the hands stopped at varying times from 4:45 to 5:15.<br>
<br>
Half a dozen more were just as sure that the clock did not stop at all, and of these one remembered how "it tolled the weary long hours of that terrible night." Incidentally, the courthouse then stood, and still stands, well up a hillside, far beyond the highest waters of the Hood.<br>
<br>
The Heppner Gazette-Times was most courteous in helping to clear up the business for me; and in good time I received a letter from Mr. 0. M. Yeager, a Heppner native who has lived there for the past sixty-seven years.  "There was a clock," Mr. Yeager was good enough to write to me, "but it was not running.  The tower of the courthouse had settled a little, enough to stop the works.  Many weeks after the flood, Judge Ayers had me take a carpenter to the tower and put in some new supports.  Then a watchmaker came and got the works to running smoothly."<br>
<br>
This would seem to correct the memories of those who had heard the weary hours of the night marked by the striking of the clock, and of those who were just as certain that the clock had stopped at the instant of disaster.  I wish that I could believe that this would settle the matter.  But I don't.<br>
<br>
I feel sure that in all oral tales of the flood, the clock in the Morrow County courthouse will either continue to stop, or to toll the weary long hours, so long as a survivor has the power of speech.<br>
<br>
Yet the supporters of this and of other myths are not to be charged with fabricating.  They are merely poets, poets seeking to fasten a measure of that mysterious thing we call art to an event or a thing that is graceless without it.<br>

p. 167-175.<br>
<br>
It had been a long sweltering day, the 14th of June, 1903- The sun traveled across the Oregon sky in a steady blaze that shriveled the wheat and sent thousands of sheep to find such shade as they could in the creek bottoms.  Since dawn the windmills on the ranches had stood motionless.  Heat blurred the vision as it shimmered in waves up and down and,across the sides of the barns.<br>
<br>
It was even worse in the village of Heppner, county seat and trading center of a vast sheep-and-wheat region.  Set in a narrow valley along tiny Willow Creek, Heppner was hemmed by stark hills.  Not a breath of air moved all that interminable Sunday.  Tar oozed from the seams of Papered shacks.<br>
<br>
Clapboards curled on the better homes.  Dogs slunk under porches and panted.  The children couldn't go swimming, for there wasn't enough water in Willow Creek to cover their knees.<br>
<br>
But four o'clock brought welcome signs of relief.  The sun abruptly disappeared.  A breeze came up, fitful yet strong.  The sky turned gray, then black.  Heppner people began to feel better.<br>
<br>
They could tell that a cooling shower was about to break the hot spell, just as hot spells had been broken time out of mind.<br>
A few big drops of rain splattered the parched roofs.  The leaves of the cottonwoods along the creek rustled nervously, and turned to the rising wind.  Then the sky, as black now as midnight, was split by a bolt, followed by thunder that sounded in the close valley like the crack of doom.  And the rain came down.<br>
<br>
Heppner folks were used to quick, violent storms.  This one seemed to be particularly violent.  Water poured down in volume such as the oldest inhabitants had never seen.  Hail came intermittently, but so thickly it began to pile up in dooryards like so much snow.  The valley and the village were lighted every few moments by savage flashes in the dark sky.  Thunder rolled in continuous volleys.<br>
<br>
It was a wonderfully exciting time for the youngsters.  They stood at windows and saw Willow Creek rising as they watched.  Fathers and mothers were unworried.  The creek might fill its banks.  It might overflow.  It had done so in the past.  But there could be no danger.  There were no dams upstream to give way, either on Willow
Creek or on Balm Fork, which joined the creek just above town.<br>
<br>
The cloudburst continued for perhaps twenty minutes, and with it the hail, the wind, the thunder and lightning.  Then the clatter of the tormented elements was wholly lost in a new and sudden roaring.  It wasn't a noise that grew.  It was a noise both mighty and full-blown when it struck the ear, and it brought men up out of their chairs and women out of their kitchens.<br>
<br>
This strange and new noise was the meeting, just above the village, of two monstrous great torrents rolling down Balm Fork and the main creek, merging into one thunderous wave of water bearing trees, ranch houses, barns, horned cattle, sheep, fences, and baled hay.  The two torrents made one flood, not of Old Testament size, but sufficient to wipe out the village of Heppner.<br>
<br>
The new steam laundry, filled with heavy machinery, held out for a few minutes, long enough to dam the waters twenty feet deep, and long enough for a few people to see what was upon them and to start running.  Then the dam gave way, loosing the rush of a lake into the streets.  Carrying children, a few of the running men managed to get out from under; but not many of the women.  Skirts were long in 1903, and the muddy water quickly made them unbearably heavy.  The women sagged, stumbled, then disappeared.<br>
<br>
George Conser, cashier of the town bank, and his wife were at<br>
home.  They heard the noise. just then the first tremendous wave struck.  The windows and doors caved in.  The Consers started up-
stairs, water at their heels.  The whole house groaned.  It wrenched.  It reeled, and then its lower portion collapsed.  Away went the Consers in their ark of an upper story.<br>
<br>
August Lundell had an instant in which to run out of his house and to climb a big cottonwood tree, dragging two youngsters with him. just then the Lundell house caught the full force of the wave.  It left its foundations, keeled over, and came rolling past, Mrs. Lundell clinging to the top side.  Her husband reached out and caught her, like a sack of mail at a way station, pulling her into the God-given tree, where the Lundell family lived it out while Heppner was being destroyed.<br>
<br>
At the fine Palace Hotel, three stories of staunch brick, Mrs. Phil Metchan, wife of the owner, who was absent, saw her two Japanese houseboys run out of the hotel toward the flood, a block away.  She couldn't tell which way the flood was going to move next, nor how fast.  She picked up Dorothy, her two-year-old, and ran for the nearest hill.  Back at the hotel the waters were already trickling into the cellar.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, the two Japanese lads were performing heroically in pulling women and children from the water and debris; and one of them gave his life in the effort.
Now the wallowing houses, the cattle, the sheep, the mud, hail, and human beings were being piled up in a hideous jam against a row of stout trees; and another dam was formed, to hold just long  enough to make and loose a second lake. It struck the little<br>
laundry and ground it instantly into a mass of kindling, killing the seven or eight poor Chinese within.<br>
<br>
Then the wave went on to leap at the Mallory home, picking it up entire, with Gus Mallory, postmaster, bedridden in an upper story, and sent it on a careening voyage halfway across the village, to come to rest on Main Street, facing the front doors of the Belvedere saloon.<br>
<br>
In the Belvedere a quiet poker game had been in progress; and between interest in the cards and the terrific din of the storm the players did not know that Heppner was already under water.<br>
<br>
Then the flood hit Main Street.  Frank Roberts, owner of the Belvedere, ran out to look for his family.  The other players left too, and Id Dick Neville, Civil War veteran and bartender, waved them on their way.  "I'll stay with her till she floats," he cried, and turned down another jolt.<br>
<br>
At the Heppner railroad station Agent Keman and family got a look at what was coming from the upper part of town.  They ran for the hills.  Kernan, however, had forgotten something, but whatever it was, it was scarcely worth the effort, for when he emerged from the depot this time, Time had caught up.  The rush of water tore him off his legs and whirled him into the dreadful hodgepodge of bodies, timbers, and other debris.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, two young men of Heppner had set out on a heroic mission.  They were Leslie Matlock and Bruce Kelley.  They saw the first big wave when the steam laundry gave way.  They knew it was too late to do much for Heppner.  It might even be too late to warn the hamlet of Lexington, ten miles down Willow Creek, and the hamlet of Ione, eight miles beyond Lexington.  But a man, two men, could try.<br>
<br>
While Kelley hurried to get horses at the one livery stable not in the path of the waters, Matlock ran to Bisbee's hardware store for wire cutters.  They would have to ride overland, and between Heppner and the lower villages were fence after fence of taut, well strung barbed wire.  The store was locked.  Matlock kicked in the door, got two pairs of cutters, then ran for the stable.  He and Kelley mounted and took off, heading over the big bare hills in order to get out of the Willow Creek Valley, now running high and fast with damnation.<br>
<br>
It was tough going, overland.  All downhill or uphill, and no road.  Dark, too.  Every half-mile or less was a fence to be cut, a dangerous business, with the sky flashing and every strand of wire potentially an electrode, ready to burn a man to a crisp.  And down came the rain, while the great hailstones beat and frightened the
horses.<br>
<br>
The animals responded well for speed, but they were hard to manage at the fences; and the cutting took time-true, only a few seconds here and a few seconds there, but they began to add up<br>
when racing a flood tearing hell-bent down Willow Creek.  The two riders came in sight of Lexington to find that the waters were going to beat them by about two minutes; but no lives were lost, though several houses were destroyed.  At Lexington the waters were damming up just as the two horsemen pounded past on the hillside above the settlement.  "We can beat her to Ione," Matlock yelled to Kelley.<br>
<br>
On they went.<br>
<br>
There were more fences to cut.  Both animals were tiring.  The riders urged, praised, cajoled, demanded, using every trick known to experienced horsemen.  The animals responded, too, and presently came galloping into tiny and unsuspecting Ione.  Matlock looked over his shoulder to see what Willow Creek looked like down here.  It was bank-full, swift, mean-looking, but the flood hadn't come yet. It wasn't in sight.<br>
<br>
The sudden appearance in the hamlet of two men on wind-blown horses brought people running out of their houses.  "Get to the hills!" Matlock cried.  Ione's total population went into action.  Driving such  stock  as  they  had  at  home,  and  carrying  such  household treasures as they could, they moved to the hills on either side of the  settlement.  The flood waters hit the village within minutes after the horsemen arrived, but not a life was lost.<br>
<br>
Back in tragic Heppner the worst had happened.  Within half an hour-some said twenty minutes-after the steam-laundry dam gave way, the flood had thundered and boiled through town, and the waters had receded until they no more than filled the banks of Willow Creek.  It had been as quick as that.<br>
<br>
The worst was bad enough.  When Phil Metchan rode into the stricken village early next morning, he saw a sight he recalled vividly almost fifty years later. it was a big, long two-horse farm wagon moving slowly up Main Street to one of the several emergency morgues.  On it were bodies piled one upon another, twenty, thirty of them, with the long mud-matted hair of women hanging out over the wheels.  All over Heppner Death was moving in somber processions, riding in wagons, carts, hay ricks, even in rubber-tired buggies.<br>
<br>
Here and there, like the Palace Hotel, a few buildings still stood -the Odd Fellows Block, the courthouse, the Fair Store, and the Belvedere saloon and its upstairs Opera House.  The latter structure's two big floors were covered now with bodies laid out under blankets and pieces of canvas.
In between these few larger buildings was the ghastly debris of the deluge-the barns and houses that had become mere piles of jackstraws in which searchers looked for, and found, still more bodies.  Before night two companies of Oregon militia had moved in to help.<br>
<br>
All day and all night, by the light of flaming torches and dim farm lanterns, an army of men dug graves while another army of carpenters sawed and hammered to make coffins.  Many would be needed.  The death count rose steadily throughout the day: 150 at noon, then 200, and finally 225 bodies were recovered, among them that of the brave Japanese lad who had lost his life in saving others. (In 1951 his was the only Japanese grave in Heppner Cemetery, and a granite marker tells of his courageous deed.)<br>
<br>
Two hundred and twenty-five people had died in Heppner between half-past four and five o'clock.  Nearly all were killed, not by drowning but by the dreadful battering.  The number of dead amounted to nearly one-quarter of the population, for Heppner's wildest booster in 19O3 claimed no more than 1100 citizens, men, women, and children.  Not even the larger and far more celebrated Johnstown Flood took so proportionately great a number of inhabitants.<br>
<br>
Heppner in mid-century is still a small place, little larger than in the times of its Deluge. Old survivors walked with me over the site of the disaster, pointing out where the Conser house had stood, and the site of the steam laundry that had held to form the first fatal dam. (Other survivors say it was a small hospital building and not the laundry which made the dam.) They showed me where the<br>
Lundell home had stood, the house that became an ark.<br>
<br>
The Mallory house yet stands.  So does the stone building that contained the Belvedere saloon and the upstairs Opera House.  This is now a drugstore, with apartments above.  Old-timers said that neither saloon nor opera house could survive their use as morgues; the association in the minds of townspeople could be dissipated neither by alcohol nor by dramatic and musical art.<br>
<br>
Heppner's local history naturally divides into two periods; one before, one after the Flood.  Still among living survivors of that tragic day is Leslie Matlock, now a patriarch, pointed out to strangers, and most properly so, as the Heppner Paul Revere, the man who rode out the Flood on horseback.  It required some per suasion to get him to tell me of the ride, about which he was modest.<br>

<br>

Elgin V. Kuykendall "Pomeroy Flood of 1950," <B>History of Garfield County.</B> Fairfield: Ye Galleon Press, 1984, 114-115.<br>
<br>
The most disastrous and tragic flood in the history of Garfield County occurred within a ten-mile radius southwesterly of Pomeroy between one o'clock a.m. and three o'clock a.m. Saturday, June 17, 1950.  This was a flash flood caused by a heavy cloudburst or waterspout over the upper water-shed of Niebel Gulch, feeding torrents of water into that narrow valley, drowning three people and causing incalculable damage to homes, gardens and fields.<br>
<br>
A thunderstorm of unusual intensity began before I o'clock Saturday moming June 17, with terrifying thunder and lightning, awakening people in the flood area and in the city of Pomeroy.  Mild thunderstorms are to be expected at that time of year, and attract little attention, but this storm was described by old settlers as one of the most severe and spectacular within their memory.<br>
<br>
A heavy rainfall accompanied the stomi extending several miles beyond the flooded area, with cloudburst proportions around the watershed of the Niebel Gulch.  Herman Baden, 76, and his wife, Mary Ann, 69, and their son, Carl, 46, were drowned while endeavoring to escape from the Baden home which was being battered, shaken and threatened with destruction by the raging torrent roaring down Niebel Gulch.<br>
<br>
Mrs.  Carl Baden's graphic description of the tragic events of that fateful night was in substance as follows:<br>
<br>
We heard the thunderstorm and got up and awoke the children.  A few minutes later we heard water roaring in the channel near the house.  Carl took his lantern and went down to investigate.  He returned and reported that the water was high but not dangerous.  At that time the storm appeared to be abating, so we went back to bed.<br>
<br>
A short time later the storm opened up again with renewed intensity.  We were all standing in the kitchen looking out the window.  Water was pouring off the roof as if poured on from buckets.  I have never seen anything like it.  Suddenly Carl exclaimed, "What's that?"<br>
<br>
Water was entering the utility room which is located between the hill and the house.  Water was just pouring through.  The dog came in then soaking wet.  Carl went out to the room to investigate.  A moment later we heard what sounded like a terrific explosion.  The whole house started moving.<br>
The electric lights went out and I lit a candle and placed it on the table.  When the explosion occurred, the kitchen window crashed and the house seemed full of smoke.  When the house started moving, Carl yelled to us to get out of the house and onto the hill.  He said the house must be on fire.<br>
<br>
We were all barefooted and had our night clothes on.  Alice Ann and I started across first, clinging together.  We fell once but finally made it.  The distance was about 30 feet and the water was up to our knees, and on the hillside it was still above our ankles.  The older folks [Mr. and Mrs. Herman Baden and Carl Baden] were behind us.<br>
<br>
We couldn't see except when the lightning flashed.  After we got over, we turned around, by the light from the lantern Carl was still carrying, we could see that grandpa and grandma were down.  They were all clinging together though Carl was still standing, trying to help them to their feet.<br>
<br>
Lyle (my son) was across, but he went back to help them.  They were about half-way to the hillside.  The water was up to Carl's waist.  It was then that the biggest rush of water came and swept them away.  Lyle was carried along too.  He was knocked out, he told me later, and when he came to his senses somewhat, he grabbed hold of some tall grass about a hundred yards downstream.<br>
<br>
When he completely recovered consciousness, he was kneeling and holding onto the grass.  We, Alice and I, just stood there, not knowing what to do.  It was raining very hard and we couldn't see a thing.  We thought they were all drowned.<br>
<br>
Finally, we decided to work our way to the machine shop and see if it was dry.  We figured it would be warmer.  We had nothing on but our soaked night clothes.  The shop was dry and we took one of Carl's old coats and put it around us as we huddled there together.<br>
<br>
Alice Ann prayed all the time.  We could see the candle burning in the kitchen.  It burned till daylight.  At dawn I heard a whistle and knew it was Lyle and ran out to meet him.  Lyle thought everyone was gone as he sat on the hillside above the houw.<br>
<br>
Such is Mrs.  Carl Baden's account of her tragic experience.  Rejoicing at the knowledge that her son Lyle was alive and safe, and weeping because of the probable death of her husband and his parents, yet faintly hoping that they had escaped drowning and, like Lyle, would soon retum, she and her children went to the house and put on dry clothes and waited till 5 o'clock, when they went to Jep Baden's place. Jep's family had just returned to the house from the bam where they had spent the night on higher ground.<br>
<br>
Jep, Carl's brother, went to Pomeroy and reported the tragedy. 
Mrs. Baden corrected a report she had heard that Herman Baden had gone back into his house for his bonds and papers, and stated that he had them with him when he first came out. Jeptha Baden reported the details of the disaster at the fire station, shortly after 5 o'clock a.m., while the local firemen were cleaning up their equipment after attending a fire at the residence of Joe Bosley in Pomeroy, started by lightning  during the same storm.<br>
<br>
The fire siren was sounded and search parties were sent out immediately.  People on the lower Pataha and on the Tucannon below the mouth of the Pataha and at Starbuck were alerted by telephone to keep a lookout for the bodies of the drowned.  Searchers above the Harris place found Carl Baden's body in a pile of debris, shortly after 9 a.m.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Herman Baden's body was found several hours later wedged in a tree, six feet from the ground.  Carl's body had been carried over five miles, and Mrs. Baden's body over a mile and a half.  It was several days before Herman Baden's body was discovered.  His son Jeptha found it concealed by debris only about balf a mile below the Baden home, after other searchers had given up the task as hopeless.<br>
<br>
Aside from the loss of life, the Baden farm was greatly damaged by the flood.  The beautiful lawn, gardens, and flowerbeds were swept away and great washed out gullies left in their places.  The house was also badly damaged, and it is difficult to estimate the cost of restoring it to its former condition.<br>
<br>
The tragic death of these excellent people cast a pall of gloom over the entire county.  Mr. and Mrs. Herman Baden will long be remembered for their examples of good citizenship and sterling character.  Carl was is the prime of life, public spirited - a natural leader who had rendered great service to the granges of the county and had a promising future ahead.  Carl Baden was buried in the Catholic cenietery Monday, June 19.  He was born at Pomeroy June 19, 1904.  He married Rosina Sitzberger at Pomeroyjune 18, 1931, and to this union two chilren were born: a daughter, Alice Ann, 17, and Lyle, a son, aged 16.<br>
<br>
At the time of his death, Herman Baden was 76 years, one month and 13 days old.  His wife, Mary Ann Baden, was 69 years, 3 months and 13 days old..Although Herman Baden's body had not then been recovered, funeral services for both were held at the Richardson funeral home and they were buried in the city cemetery; Mrs. Baden onjune 19, 1950, and Herman Baden on July 8, 1950, his body having been recovered on July 6.<br>
<br>
OTHER FLOOD DAMAGE<br>
<br>
No other lives were lost, but the Oscar Niebel family endured tragic experiences and sustained losses which Mr. Niebel estimated at not less than $30,000.  The family were caught in the torrent
and narrowly escaped drowning.  Their house, located in the upper portion of the Niebel Gulch, was severely damaged, and portions of it were washed away.<br>
<br>
Their yard and lawn were torn out and gullies as much as twelve feet deep were left in the wake of the raging torrent.  Their household equipment-including piano, radio, beds and clothing- were swept away and ruined.  Also damaged were the homes of Chris Baden, Dick Baden, jeptha Baden, Jack Luper, Justin Fitzgerald, Matt and Ben Slaybough, and Thiron Crawford.<br>
<br>
At Zumwalt, on fhe Tatinan Gulch, into which the other flooded guiches emptied and where the Tatman entered the Pataha, the stream became a mighty xiver.  Here the bridge across the Pataha on the 3 L Highway was pushed out of position, about thirty inches at one end and forty inches at the other.<br>
<br>
Even as far away as Ping Gulch, fields were badly scarred by erosion, growing grain destroyed, and roads washed out.  The heavy rains on the fringe of the cloudburst washed mud and debris into the streets in the southerly portion of Pomeroy, particularly on the easterly part of Arlington Street, and First, Second and Third Streets.  The city promptly sent crews to clean off the mud which in some places was six inches deep.<br>
<br>
HELP BY NEIGHBORS<br>
<br>
With the typical western spirit of cooperation, the people in the neighborhoods of the stricken familes, as well as from Pomeroy, with tractors, bulldozers, scrayeis, shovels and rakes, and host of willing hands, labored long hours to restore the yards and homes most severely damaged in order to make them habitable as quickly as possible, while others furnished food for the workers.<br>

The Vanport Flood<br>
<br>
by Judy Walters<br>
<br>
VANPORT FLOOD.<br>
<br>
Judy Walters, "The Vanport Flood," <B>Clark County History.</B> XXXI (1990) p. 71-77.<br>
<br>
Memorial Day, May 30,1948 at about 4:00 p.m. disaster struck the city of Vanport.  Vanport, a wartime housing project containing 18,500 residents and the second largest city in,Oregon, was completely destroyed by flooding waters after the dike broke leaving nothing but memories of a city that was.<br>
<br>
The city of Vanport was the first largest wartime housing project in the nation for the war workers.  The Kaiser Foundation started the project and it was later taken over by the Portland Housing Authority.  It was completed in September, 1943.'<br>
<br>
The construction of this instant city was a rush job as was everything connected with the war effort and poor quality materials were used.  A Congressional investigating committee faulted the quality of the construction of the project and of the public services.'<br>
<br>
Vanport was a city that housed people of all races.  The blacks, who were a significant percentage of the residents, had their own assigned areas.  The stores, churches and other facilities, however, were available to everyone regardless of race.  The housing pro'ect residents were mostly employees of the shipyards.  The shipyards ran three shifts, twenty-four hours a day and women comprised many of the employees.  Day cares and schools ran long hours to accommodate the working parents.  The families often only saw each other on weekends.<br>
<br>
Vanport was a place to survive, barely, as life was not easy for its residents.  They had to contend with racial differences, little family life, poorly built homes, very little material values and long, hard working hours at the shipyards.<br>
<br>
This hardworking community was to exist only for a few short years.  It was constructed swiftly and was completely destroyed in a matter of a few minutes.<br>
<br>

A railroad fill, which served as part of the protective dike system, failed and within minutes the gap in the dike had @dened to about 600 feet.  After 2 hours, 10 to 20 feet of debris-laden water completely inundated Vanport destroying all the blilldings.  Most people fled on foot because over 400 stalled automobiies jammed traffic at the exits of the community.<br>
<br>
Most residents were unable to to salvage even small household effects, and rescue workers had to lift some people from the roofs of floating apartment buildings.  The destructive flood caused an almost total loss of public and private property and killed 15 people.  Had the tragedy occurred at night or during a weekday, loss of life would probably have been much higher.<br>
<br>
The entire dike system, including the railroad fill that eventually failed had been repeatedly inspected for 6 days prior to the breach.  A Division Engineer telegraphed to the Chief of Engineers that "the situation appeared at all times to be quite favorable and under full control by those charged with the responsibility for maintenance of the flood protection project."<br>
<br>
On May 31 a crew foreman noticed a crack in the fill and called for a Corps inspector and while examining it "the entire section seemed to disappear at once and both foreman and inspector had to run for their lives.'<br>
<br>
Weather conditions from the above normal temperatures in late spring, heavy precipitatation in the last half of May, combined with a heavy snow pack, sent a tremendous volume of water pouring off the mountains into the streams and rivers which feed into the Columbia.6<br>
Water had risen to 26.7 at Vancouver on May 29, and meterologists predicted it would rise four more feet, which would be two feet over the top of the local levees.'<br>
<br>
The Vancouver Columbian newspaper's front page on May 3 1, 1948 spelled out these words in large, bold type, "3 1 -Foot Crest Tuesday; New Breaks Feared; Ruins Probed." The day's newspaper was filled with writing and pictures of the catastrophe.<br>
<br>
A front page news report added, "Another dike was threatening to break today under the raging flood that destroye.@ this town of 18,700 people yesterday as completely as a mashed toy village.  Everyone, except rescue workers hunting'bodies in the shattered town, was ordered out of the area to avoid being caught in a second break."<br>
<br>
The prearranged siren signal for the residents was sounded within minutes as a 6 foot wall of water swept into the city.  Hundreds heard the warning but since earlier reports had said they were in
no imminent danger, they ignored the danger at first.  They were told that plenty of warning would be given if the "dike" was threatened.<br>
<br>
The advice was on mimeographed sheets distributed by the Portland Housing Authority.  The U.S. Army Engineers advised Saturday night that no north Portland dikes were seriously endangered.  There were some that did not hear the warning horns and sirens.  Many residents refusing to leave their homes were forced by police officers with drawn guns.  One officer said, "The people just didn't believe that there would be a break; they wanted to see the water first before fleeing their homes.  Many stopped to pack belongings or aid neighbors."<br>
<br>
Rescue workers reported seeing many men in small power boats breaking into second story windows after the water had Submerged the lower floors.<br>
<br>
A deputy sheriff said he saw four persons in a car being crushed Linder a floating building and many persons said they saw clilldren being swept away, yet there were just a few accounts of possi 'ble flood victims the next morning.  Another witness toldof " watching men cry as they saw a man trying to climb up the side of the house, lose his footing and was hit by a log and disappeared."ll<br>
<br>
At least one hundred fifty cars, trucks and buses were Submerged according to other witnesses.  A local businessman told of trying to salvage some of his store's stock in his truck and realized the flood was worse than he had believed.  His words "life, not property was the question" were well echoed.  He went on to say "I saw several fear-crazed people who were hurt by the cars, we helped those that we could onto our truck which was never more than 50 or 100 feet ahead of oncoming muddy waves that spashed 20 or 30 feet as it hit and crumpled the buildings.  I saw dozens of people overtaken and thrown down by the wave."<br>
<br>
Vancouver was cut off from train and mail service.  The Interstate Bridge was closed to all but emergency traffic.  Industrial plants were closed down with the exception of Alcoa.  Alcoa, completely surrounded by water, protected by sand dikes, kept employees working regular shifts by ferrying the workers of the aluminum plant in and out by boat.<br>
<br>
The Red Cross made 10,000 cots and blankets available and gave food and clothing when necessary, to the victims brought to temporary rehabilitation centers by buses, trucks and private cars.  I I<br>
Survivors of the Vanport flood recall their experiences on that unforgetable Memorial Day.<br>
<br>
Laura Brumfield, was only two years old at the time the flood<br>
hit.  She recalls she lost all her red hair and quit talking as she  was so frightened.
<br>
Laura's mother told her of having the*r ant*que s*lver tea set stolen except for a couple of pieces that had fallen from the shelf and were buried by the mud.<br>
<br>
Sandi Johnson, a girl of five years when her family was caught in the disaster told of being driven to a safer place by a family friend, Red, in his convertible.  While enroute to higher and safer ground, a man stopped their car and was screaming at Red to take his kids with them.<br>
<br>
The car was already full: the man begged so desperately, Red agreed.  She remembers there were about six children and each one of them had either a kitten or a toy in hand.<br>
<br>
The older children rode on the bumpers and the younger ones sat on laps in Red's already crammed car.  Red took them to a hill<br>
where they were taken by bus to a Red Cross center in Vancouver.<br>
<br>
"We were separated from our Mom and Dad for a couple of days which seemed forever." Sandi had just recovered from having the mumps and 
her older brother, Tom, had them at the time.  The <B>two </B>of them went to live with relatives in Vernonia, Oregon, while her younger sister and brother were with her parents at another relative's house.  It was about a month before they were united.<br>
<br>
Sandi summed it up with these moving words, "We lost everything but had nothing really."<br>
<br>
Sandi's father, Walter Wooldridge, was working at the slilpyards and gave his story of the flood's affect on him and his family.  "Me and some of the guys were out having a few beers when the dike broke." He said some of the men couldn't get their cars started.  His wife and children were separated from him.<br>
<br>
"Pearl went to St. Johns and I had a hell of a time finding her." When he went back to their apartment, they were on a second floor, all he could see on the wall were the nails that had held his new 33 rifle.  It was stolen along with their radio and other small personal items.  He remembered seeing a lot of sheriffs watching for looters.  Wally told of a brand new refrigerator that was ruined from water.  He salvaged it, had it repaired and has it in his garage today, saying of it, "It doesn't work too good; it runs all the time.""<br>
<br>
Wally and his family's episodes of that eventful day were probably a typical scene for most of the families in the city of Vanport.  Torn away from thelrh@omes and lovedones; they were sometimes unaware of each other's whereabouts for days.<br>
<br>
Charles Bellinger, retiree of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, was
attending classes at Vanport College where most of the students were veterans.  After the flood, the college moved to St. Johns then to Lincoln High School and finally downtown Portland where it is today, and, is now Portland State Universtiy.  The college was closed for the Memorial Day holiday so many of the students had left for their break, which Charles feels, saved a lot of of lives.<br>
<br>
His account of the reason for the dike failing was very informative.  "Reason dike failed is the railroad fill had been  a trestle.  The trestle was too old so they dumped material over the side and buried the trestle as it was.  The old trestle rotted out 
in the railroad fill and water seeped in the fill and it was super saturdated with water and became mushy and pressure from the water blew it out and caused it to fail."<br>
<br>
Shirley Bellinger, as well as her husband, remember certain incidents from that day.  Shirley was attending Vancouver H'gh School.  That Sunday was Baccalaureate for her graduating class of '48.  A fellow student, who was living with her sister at Vanport and attending Vancouver High School, told Shirley she was in the midst of ironing her cap and gown when the flood hit and she ran out of the house with the iron in one hand and her cap and gown the other.<br>
<br>
After graduation the graduates couldn't go anywhere to celebrate as it was a state of emergency. To the north Woodland was being flooded and to the south Portland was closed.  Since there was no television coverage, news was received by word of mouth, newspapers or by first hand citing.<br>
<br>
An interview with Lorraine Gemmel, a resident of Vancouver since 1927, tells of her dilemma while being pregnant at the time of the flood.  Lorraine and her husband were visiting friends in John Day, Oregon.<br>
<br>
On their return trip back home to Vancouver, they were stranded in Portland and had to stay in a hotel for one week.  They finally crossed over the Bridge of the Gods to return to the Washington side and home.  Lorraine said emphatically, "It was a miracle more people were not killed.  The only road to Portland from Vancouver was Denver Avenue and it was washed out.  Some people used helicopters or private boats, which were very few in those days, to leave the area."<br>
<br>
An article in the June 2, 1948 Columbian "Confidence Unlimited" summed up "the isolation we have experienced could hardly have been more complete had we been the center of an enemy bombing mission.  Lack of all types of communications, railroads, highways and wires

has made this community an <B>entity</B> unto itself.  And, thrown on our own resources, we haven't done too bad, either.""<br>

GAMBLING, CHINA-STYLE.<br>
<br>
Nancy A. Quense, "Gambling, China style," <B>Seattle Magazine.</B> p. 31.<br>
<br>
The big coin reproduced here is worth one dollar in a Chinese gambling den.  On it are Chinese characters identifying the club where it was bought.  I can say this in full assurance of being accurate, even though the money I have spent in my lifetime on gambling is next to peanuts-and I am certainly not Chinese.  The reason I can be so sure about what the coin is, is simply this: I have been there, and I know.<br>
<br>
Such dens have an Orientals-only policy, the only exceptions being Occidental girls escorted by Oriental males.  Fortunately, I have a Chinese friend named Lee Wong, who volunteered to take me on a Cook's tour of gambling spots in Chinatown.  We met there one recent Saturday night around midnight and began our rounds by walking in a leisurely fashion down Maynard Street.<br>
<br>
Along the way he explained that most of Seattle's six Chinese clubs are remnants of the old tongs, or family clans.  In each club, he went on, the house takes a five per cent cut of the winnings, with the proceeds going to take care of oldsters-plus the neighborhood cop.<br>
<br>
Just then Lee took my arm and steered me quickly into a darkened alley for about 30 feet and then turned into a large doorway to our left.  As we entered it, a burly figure stepped out of the shadows in front of us.  Alarmed, I grabbed Lee's arm, but as soon as the man had peered closely at both our faces, he crossed to our left and pushed a button on the wall.<br>
<br>
The door in front of us swung open, and we stepped into a small vestibule which was even darker than the doorway.  After waiting a few seconds, we heard a harsh female voice call out: "The alley door's not closed yet!"<br>
<br>
Lee reached behind him and closed the door to the alley-whereupon another door swung open in front of us.  Now we stepped into a noisy cabaret, about 30 feet long by 20 feet wide.  In front of us was a row of four or five tables, and to the right, on a slightly lower level, were another eight or ten tables, a small dance floor and a jukebox.  The room was jammed with people, nearly all of them young Oriental couples.  Although I noticed two other Caucasian girls, no Caucasian men were in evidence.<br>
<br>
Lee and I sat down and had a round of drinks.  Next he led me through a doorway in the back of the room and up a narrow, twisting flight of stairs.  "Don't be nervous," Lee said.  "Just flash your
money around to let 'em know what you're here for." I was prepared for the worst, but once we had passed through a doorway at the top of the stairs, my apprehensions quickly vanished.  We had entered an ordinary room with dingy white walls-about the size of<br>
<br>
sleeves. (I was the only woman of any race.) In one corner a couple of men were watching the Johnny Carson show on television, while across from them an old man was immersed in the P-l's comics.<br>
<br>
Whatever the room lacked in atmosphere, it easily made up in action.  All of the men around the tables were clearly intent on winning as much money as possible (no one paid the slightest heed to me), and even from the doorway it was apparent that this money was changing hands at a very rapid rate.  The room was filled with a beehive-hum of conversation, most of it in rapid-fire Chinese.<br>
<br>
Excitedly I purchased $20 worth of house chips-silver dollar-sized steel discs like the one shown above-and, pulling Lee along by his sleeve, headed for the nearest of the tables.<br>
<br>
My excitement, however, soon changed to frustration.  The game in progress at the first table was 21, or blackjack, and although I had a vague knowledge of the rules, the cards were flying so fast that I had little idea of what was actually going on.  A few minutes later-and $10 poorer-[ pulled Lee along to the next table.  Here the game was fan-tan, which, to my relief, moved a great deal slower than blackjack.<br>
<br>
The dealer sat at one end of the table, and after scattering a group of tiny buttons from a metal chalice, he used a pointer to divide them into groups of four.  The number of buttons varied with each deal, explained Lee, and the object of fan-tan was to try to guess how many buttons would be left in the final group.<br>
<br>
All of this was simple enough-except the betting itself, which required that each bettor place his chips on the table along with a small strip of metal, the exact position of which was supposed to indicate the number of buttons he was betting on and the odds he wanted.  After making a few attempts to decipher this complex system, I noticed my chips had disappeared.  End of my whirl at fan-tan.<br>
<br>
"Isn't there a place with some easier games?" I asked.
He gave me a rather surprised look and then thought for a moment.  "Well," he said finally, "there's this other place that has a keno board."<br>
<br>
"A keno board?" I said slowly.  "Oh keno!" Sure, let's go!" (i had never heard of keno either, of course, but it couldn't be any more confusing than the fan-tan betting.)<br>
<br>
A short way down the street we entered a magazine shop, in the back of which a curving hallway led around to the left.  In a corner of the hallway, near the ceiling, was a small mirror in which I could see the figure of an elderly Chinese seated on a high stool.  Lee suggested I wait in front of the mirror while he went ahead to talk with the guard-anyway, he looked like a guard.  The man on the stool kept shaking his head, and I could hear Lee saying, "But she's from out of town!"<br>
<br>
Finally Lee turned and motioned for me to come along.  When I caught up with him, the guard glared at me for a moment and then, reaching up, pulled a cord hanging just above his head.  Now a door in front of us swung open, and we walked in, all nonchalance.<br>
<br>
This second room was much like the first-tables in the center and a TV set in one corner-except that high on the wall to our left was a large board with rows of numbers reading from right to left and running from 1 to 80.  "All you have to do," Lee said laconically -1 could tell he considered this a game strictfy for children and Caucasians-"is write down any ten numbers between 1 and 80, then give them to that lady at the back table.  She'll choose 20 numbers, and if half of yours are among them, you double your money.  If yours all come up, you win $10,000."<br>
<br>
In my first try only one of my numbers came up, but five were chosen in my second attempt, and I won $20.  Now, just as I felt something big on the way, Lee told me we had to call it a night.  "I've got a golf game at seven in the morning," he said.<br>
<br>
"A golf game," I said. (At the time the thought of my Chinese friend playing golf struck me as singularly incongruous, but I've since realized it's just one more example of the workings of the melting pot-like Johnny Carson and the P-1 comics.) "Okay, you go ahead.  I'm staying."<br>
<br>
"No," he said.  "You can't stay without me.  Let's go."<br>
<br>

Glumly I followed him down the hallway and out onto the street.  Since then, I haven't seen my Chinese acquaintance, but I do hope he won his golf game.  He'd better have.  Because our premature departure cost me, I'm sure of it, a cool ten thousand dollars.<br>

<br>
YESTERYEAR COLUMN, MARCH 21, 1986<br>
<br>
On Feb 6, 1884, Harry Morgan sauntered into town.  The economy was down; jobs were hard to find.  In defiance of the law, Morgan opened a gaming hall and, since that day, Tacoma has never been the same.<br>
<br>
"I tell you," said Morgan, "a town without gamblers and  saloons  ain't  worth a _____."<br>
<br>
Twenty years later, the economy had taken another turn downward.  In 1904, Mayor George P. Wright promised a "Greater Tacoma", then declared an "open-town policy" to liven things up.<br>
<br>
Back in 1885, as Morgan's Board of Trade Billiard Hall was getting firmly established, Mayor J. Robert Weisbach gathered support in blaming the city's economic situation on the presence of the Chinese.  More prim citizens indentitied the city's problem as saloons, gambling halls, and, houses of prostitution conspicuously located near the business section of town.<br>
<br>
Shouts that "the Chinese must go!" drowned out those of the impractical reformers--Reactionary crowds herded the Chinese past Morgan's place and out of town.  From the bluff above Commencement Bay, patrons in the new, massive Tacoma Hotel looked down on the flames rising from the piggy shacks and businesses of the Chinese lining the waterfront.<br>
<br>
Time marched on and periodically the chief of police raided houses of ill-fame--Mollie Rosenkranz's Star Lodging House and Mrs. Lizzie Howe's (alias Mother Brewer and the White Elephant) notorious
house, both on C street (now Broadway).  The Proprietors and unfortunate "inmates" of these disreputable dens of infamy were ushered to the calaboose and finedwhile, as the <B>Ledger</B> reported, "the(ir) gambling (procurers were) neither arrested nor taxed."<br>
<br>
Well, Gambler Morgan was doing just fine.  In 1887, performances in his  Theatre Comique were met with great  enthusiasm.  New  stars  appeared  every  week-- the queen of the tight wire Nettle Holland, comedian Billy O'Day, and singer Jesse LeSeur entertained patrons.<br>
<br>
Tacoma, the City of Destiny, prospered as the population doubled each year.  The Northern Pacific Railroad added a masterpiece building to the city's landscape. masonry, architectural edifices were going up all over town.<br>
<br>
A block away from the NP building, at 815 Pacific, stood Harry Morgan's place at the gateway into the city--smack-dab in the middle of progress.<br>
<br>
"The tin horn must go!" replaced "the Chinese must go!" and became the major theme of 1888, even though there were 42 saloons in town.  "Morgan runs a vulgar and obscene variety theatre and gambling hell ... This gambling hell is a disgrace to the City of Destiny," reported the <B>Ledger</B>.<br>
<br>
Chuck-a-luck, sluice, faro, roulette, red-white-and-blue, and a game bearing the name of stud-horse poker brought raids of Gambler Morgan's place and revocation of his liquor license.<br>
<br>
After the "tin horn's" untimely death in 1890, the action moved up to Opera Alley--Court C from 9th to 17th streets.  The dance halls, gambling rooms, and bordellos lining Opera Alley made it the hang-out for the city's most "dangerous criminal characters."<br>
<br>
Several years of hard times followed the Depression of 1893.  By the time Tacoma began to awaken at the turn-of-the-century, the Women's Temperance union was on hand demanding that "evil be stamped out of the city.  "<br>
<br>
Opera Alley was concentrated now along south C street between 15th and 17th, appearing very obvious.  The "red light" district found Itself in a peculiarly unfortunate location surrounded by residences, passed by cable cars, and close to public schools.<br>
<br>
The City Council Police and License ccmittee came up with a solution to this "foul blot in the very vitals of the city."   Thus, the comittee suggested confining the evil to one place by
substituting the conspicuous district wlth one less noticeable to the public eye.<br>
<br>
As the City Council spoke, a new building was going up on A street between 14th and 15th-a large, rectangular three-story building with 208 - 8' x 8' rooms.<br>
<br>
Some people were outraged early in 1903, as the A street building took shape.  Reverend Barnhisel warned the Ministerial Alliance, "when the devil gets to housekeeping down there the people of Tacoma will have all the hell they want."<br>
<br>
Opera Alley continued to vibrate with the "ceaseless rattle of decrepit piano, ribald songs... (and) course laughter of men, boys and fallen Saloons lined C street--the Elk at 1546, Marconi's at 1520, the Svea at 1518, Frank Petta's Rainer at 1512, the Carbone brothers' Columbus at 1502, and the Old Pal at 1356 on the corner of 15th.  Backrooms were lined with tiers of "boxes" where "beer rustlers" hustled drinks and other fares.<br>
<br>
So, when Mayor Wright declared an "open-town policy", the lower districts of Tacoma enjoyed the best of times.<br>
<br>
The Phenix theater at 14th and Pacific became the twentieth-century Theatre Comique.  Women with heavily-rouged faces rustled beer, May Fisher held the title of queen of "hell's half acre", and on stage singers belted out "Ain't It A Shame."<br>
<br>
Gambler Morgan's games seemed quite mild to "playing the ponies" at the Warwick Turf Exchange at 1205 Pacific.  Bookmaking, betting on horses, was characterized as the worst form of gambling known because it dragged down honest men.<br>
<br>
And, the large A street bordello behind the Phenix theater became<br>
as "Sandberg's joint." Abandoned women paid $2 a night for an 8' x 8' room and $10 a month to the Chief of Police for protection.<br>
<br>
"There ain't no ten commandment's (down there)" wrote a newspaper reporter in 1906.  No, Tacoma has never been the same since Harry Morgan sauntered into town.<br>

TACOMA ONCE WAS WIDE OPEN TOWN<br>

<br>
Early-Day Editor Recalls Days When Campaign Against Vice and Political Corruption Was Waged at Great Risk<br>
<br>
When prosperous days in early Tacoma attracted criminals<br>
of the worst type to the city and liquor and gambling elements<br>
came into virtual control, it was at great hazard to life<br>
and property that the editor of the old Tacoma Ledger conducted<br>
an ardent editorial campaign against existing conditions.<br>
<br>
R. F. Radebaugh, then editor of the Ledger, and latter of the<br>
Tribune, tells here of the battle he fought against the under-<br>
world ring, to a successful conclusion.<br>
<br>
+++++++<br>
<br>
Not least among the many troubles which young and fast-<br>
growing cities have had to contend with, especially in this<br>
western country and especially before the glad era of establish-<br>
ing prohibition , was the necessity of repressing the rough<br>
characters seeking loot and invariably attracted by the first<br>
signs of prosperity.<br>
<br>
Trusting partly to the assumed imperfect state of appliances<br>
for enforcement of the law and party to the laxness of order<br>
which usually accompanies the development of a new country,<br>
the waifs and strays of society, the pariahs of civilization,<br>
gravitate inevitably to the places where money is known to be<br>
plentiful and rapidly changing hands.<br>
<br>
It becomes then a serious question for the law-abiding part of the community how best to protect it and guard its good name from the ill-repute that would mark it as a place to be avoided.<br>
<br>
Bad Class Came<br>
<br>
Tacoma was not, even in the early years of its career,<br>
an exception to this rule. In the conditions of thrift<br>
arising from her fast-spreading fame as the seaport terminus<br>
of a transcontinental railroad nearing completion, she was<br>
suddenly brought to face and seriously struggle with the elements<br>
of vice in all of its disgusting and hideous forms.<br>
<br>
Her rapid growth in the last half of the 80's and generally acknowledged claim to be the destined Liverpool of the Pacific
Coast, while causing steady influx here of large numbers of worthy people, including substantial capitalists, were found to be attracting also in larger numbers, the criminals parasites of society.<br>
<br>
In summer when the Tacoma Daily Ledger was still quite<br>
young, 1883, or perchance 1884, there appeared in one of the shack<br>
storerooms of cheese cloth and paper walls that had for some<br>
time been vacant in block 704, a few doors north of where the<br>
Donnelly Hotel now stands, a man of medium stature and weight<br>
(probably in the 40's) light complexion, eyes and hair, full<br>
brown beard, quiet and deliberate mein, and remarkably few<br>
words, modestly but well clad.<br>
<br>
In passing I casually noted him and the otherwise<br>
unoccupied room, observing that there was no stock of merchan-<br>
dise or other sign of business purpose there evident. Meet-<br>
ing a Ledger reporter I inquired about the case, and he told<br>
me that the stranger was a tin-horn gambler of the worst<br>
type.<br>
<br>
If he explained what kind of a gambler he was I totally for-<br>
got. But I probably assumed it to be a very wicked kind,<br>
for I remember to have expressed desire that the gambler be<br>
induced to leave town.<br>
<br>
Paper Fought Tin-Horn<br>
<br>
After a short but vigorous campaign of exposure by the<br>
reporter through the columns of the Ledger in articles<br>
headed "The Tin-Horn Must Go," he left, and we did not see<br>
him again for a long time. But in two or three years he came<br>
back with a bigger sack than he had before, entrenched him-<br>
self on the eastern side of Pacific Avenue, about opposite<br>
the location of his first venture from which he had been driven,<br>
and on a site since covered by the Olympus Hotel.<br>
<br>
There, with a drinking saloon and gambling hall in<br>
adjoining rooms, a low variety theater called the Comique<br>
in the rear, and a brass band, he inflicted upon our city<br>
during a period of three or four years to day of his death in<br>
April, 1890, literally a terrible scourge of vice, immensely<br>
to the degradation and permanent injury of a large number of<br>
our men and boys and to the blackening of the community reputation throughout the country and abroad.<br>
<br>
That was Henry S. Morgan, alias the notorious Harry Morgan,<br>
familiar with southwestern stage routes and Colorado state<br>
institutions, and carrying in his limp and shuffling gait the<br>
perpetual mark of a pal's vengeance.<br>
<br>
Gaming Was Open<br>

All of the games usual in such dives--faro, roulette,<br>
poker, craps and the rest--were played in Morgan's gambling<br>
rooms. Every night those apartments were filled until a very<br>
late hour. It was reported that upwards of 500 men had many<br>
times crowded in there and that most of them played. It was<br>
a fast-speed money maker. His wealth was variously estim-<br>
ated as high as a million dollars. Testimony of Frank Cantwell,<br>
one of the employees, relating to Morgan's estate, was that<br>
on an average the house won from $20,000 to $30,000 a month.<br>
<br>
But a large percentage of the winnings and grabbings was taken<br>
by dealers and other employees and the balance for the most<br>
part expended in bad investments, bribery of police and other<br>
officials, court expenses and lawyers' fees, and in dispensing<br>
gifts of coin to maintain backing against the press and other<br>
protesting influences. So that at the windup the Morgan estate<br>
was found to have shrunk to $28,000.<br>
<br>
In the operation of the dive there was an ever present<br>
rough actor known as a bouncer, a brutal shoulder hitter,<br>
ready to battle beyond recognition with his powerful fist the<br>
face of any poor devil who having been robbed by a dealer,<br>
demanded restitution.<br>
<br>
All such victims--and the number was not a few--if insis-<br>
tant on their claims for recovery, were ruthlessly thrown or<br>
kicked into the street by the hired bouncer and the police<br>
were kept well out of the way by the chief. There were also<br>
among the hangers-on of the dive known ex convicts eager for al-<br>
most any job that required daring and afforded god pay, ready<br>
to execute the will of the silent boss.<br>
<br>
Missed Their Man<br>
<br>
Two masked men shot and killed Enoch Crosby, a peaceable<br>
and worthy young citizen, at C and South 6th Streets, mistak-<br>
ing him, as suspected by others, for Nelson Bennett. Ex-<br>
convicts, forced upon the Ledger editorial rooms and set fire<br>
to the building. Loggers and other strangers were drugged and<br>
robbed in Morgan's resort--the like was of frequent occurrence.<br>
Men made drunk and stupefied to insensibility by Morgan's bad<br>
whiskey were rolled in his dive and their purses lifted.<br>
<br>
The brass band, sitting on the open air balcony erected<br>
for that purpose over the front entrance, discoursed beautiful<br>
music in early evening for drawing the crowd to guzzle, gamble<br>
and play. The balcony in the theater was divided into convenient boxes so screened that while the occupants commanded<br>
full view of the audience and stage, they were invisible from<br>
without.<br>
<br>
These boxes were industriously worked by pretty women for
the sale of wine, beer and other liquors at high prices, the<br>
charge for poor wine being $5 a bottle and beer $1 a bottle or<br>
25 cents a drink; these comely female "box rustlers," as they<br>
were called, earning a big rake off for inducing the men to<br>
buy while seeking engagements for later in the night.<br>
<br>
Backsliders There<br>
<br>
By reason of the effective concealment of the box<br>
interiors, they were often the resort of prominent citizens<br>
and lax church members, weak enough to be attracted by the vulgar novelty of the disgusting plays there enacted, and who at<br>
close of the entertainment carefully threaded their uncertain<br>
steps through devious and unlighted passages to alley or other<br>
unobserved outlet with hat pulled down and face muffled against<br>
recognition.<br>
<br>
In that time practically all of the other numerous drink-<br>
ing saloons in Tacoma were also gambling dens, but they did not<br>
roll the drunks, or drug, rob or bounce their patrons. The<br>
foremost of them, next to the Comique, was the Paragon, located<br>
on the east side of Pacific Avenue, between 10th and 11th<br>
Streets, which did a large and profitable business.<br>
<br>
But the number of gambling places was held rigidly<br>
against increase by reason of the Comique influence in the<br>
city council, one member of which body was himself a saloon-<br>
keeper.<br>
<br>
For Town's Good<br>
<br>
No new gambling resort could be opened in Tacoma with-<br>
out first having obtained Morgan's consent in order to pro-<br>
cure a license. That influence was due largely to merchants<br>
who contending that their profitable sales depended on running<br>
a "wide open town" exerted their pressure accordingly and continuously on the council and police department.<br>
<br>
The wide open town attracted loggers and other laboring<br>
men desiring amusement and a few days off for a drinking bout,<br>
and was assumed to be a distinct and valuable asset of local<br>
business opportunity. How the Ledger regarded and treated<br>
that sophistry was seen in the following editorial paragraph<br>
which appeared in the issue of June 29, 1888:<br>
<br>
"The chief of police is quoted as favoring the licensing<br>
of gambling houses and as guaranteeing to 'run the works'<br>
satisfactorily. By all means, we suggest that stealing also<br>
be licensed. The license should be fixed low enough to permit<br>
thieves to make a fair profit. They will then frequent Tacoma<br>
and buy their supplies from Tacoma 'merchants.'<br>
<br>
The chief of police could be relied upon to 'run the works' and see that just enough stealing be done to promote the public welfare
and encourage thieves to come to Tacoma and spend their money<br>
with the 'merchants' here. The criminal law should always be<br>
enforced with due regard to the wishes of the 'merchants.'<br>
<br>
It must also be borne in mind that the welfare of a community<br>
depends largely upon the amount of money obtained by gambling<br>
and stealing from those who earn it and shared by gamblers and<br>
thieves with the 'merchants' who encourage and applaud the<br>
crimes by which the money is obtained. A community thoroughly<br>
imbued with these principles and possessed of a chief of police<br>
desirous of carrying them out is certain to be hap. Blessed<br>
is Tacoma."<br>
<br>
Citizens Were Enraged<br>
<br>
Accentuating the seriousness of the situation--the grave<br>
concern and apprehension of the public at large--the common<br>
council of the city in its helpfulness and dismay was desper-<br>
ately wrestling in a slough of despond with the tangle of<br>
divided responsibility due to weak and inefficient enactments<br>
affecting saloons and gambling, and there was much talk of call-<br>
ing a mass meeting to deal with the persistent encroachment of<br>
the criminals who were- believed to be running the town.<br>
<br>
Exposure by the Tacoma Daily Ledger of the unlawful prac-<br>
tices and crimes that were committed at the Comique and denun-<br>
ciations of the proprietor and all other persons appearing to<br>
be responsible for them, including the police and city council<br>
had proceeded steadily for months in the fall of 1888, when<br>
verbal threats, authoritatively declared by detectives in my<br>
employ, to have been uttered by Morgan, began to reach me.<br>
<br>
The Ledger, he asserted, was making it very costly for him<br>
and he was not going to stand for it. A detective reported<br>
that one of Morgan's ex-convict attendants had urged him to<br>
make a raid on the Ledger office and clean it out. To this<br>
suggestion he replied: "Don't take me for a greenhorn; there<br>
are more guns up there than our crowd could face and they'd<br>
begin shooting on sight."<br>
<br>
In the same year Albert E. Joab, a graduate of Yale Univer-<br>
sity and member of the bar, arrived in Tacoma from Denver,<br>
Colorado, and accepted tender of a position as reporter on the<br>
Daily Ledger. In his canvass for news he did not neglect the<br>
fruitful source of the Comique which was subjected to exploit<br>
without much intermission by the local department of the paper<br>
as well as held under fire of the editorial columns.<br>
<br>
His keen penetration and understanding of events and his<br>
training in the use of good English and graphic forms of<br>
speech rendered strikingly clear and forcible his reports of<br>
the news gathered by him and so it happened that he daily
struck stinging and hurtful blows at the peace and prospects<br>
of that common enemy of the city's well being and fair name.<br>
<br>
Gamblers Made Overtures<br>
<br>
As a consequence Morgan "had it in for him," and took<br>
occasion to call and see me at my office in Campbell and Powell's<br>
building, 936 Pacific Avenue, and complain about the hostile<br>
course pursued by Mr. Joab.<br>
<br>
By that interview and practical invitation to more friendly<br>
relations my visitor had hoped to avert the necessity for<br>
risking the violent and criminal expedients which he had in<br>
contemplation. But his complaint and overture generally being<br>
ignored by me, we soon heard further from the aggrieved party<br>
on two signal occasions.<br>
<br>
An attack on Mr. Joab by two thugs he had never seen before<br>
had been cunningly staged to take place early in the evening<br>
in a quiet restaurant little frequented, on the east side of<br>
Pacific Avenue a few doors north of 10th Street, where for a<br>
considerable time it had been his custom to take his dinner in<br>
the company of Charles Barton, the city editor.<br>
<br>
The two friends were seated at a table awaiting service<br>
of the dinner ordered by them and the proprietor was behind the<br>
counter, no others being present.<br>
<br>
Appeared then the two thugs, low browed, dark visaged and<br>
of generally forbidding appearance, resembling ignorant foreigners.<br>
<br>
Entering together, they immediately directed offensive<br>
and vulgar language at Mr. Joab with the evident object of<br>
provoking a fight. As well the lighted match to gun powder.<br>
His quick wit named to him the party who had sent these<br>
desperadoes, and why, and made it seem certain that they would<br>
get him if he failed to overcome and drive them out. He<br>
was without weapon of any kind and Barton did not move to<br>
his assistance, being timid from memory of a killing back<br>
east done by him in self defense. Hence, quick as a flash,<br>
Joab opened and continued in lead of the fight--in fact did all<br>
of the fighting by hurling the dishes especially heavy sugar<br>
bowls.<br>
<br>
He thus held both of the ruffians at a safe distance<br>
away from him where they could not use their knives and<br>
kept them busy dodging his fearful missiles. But he made<br>
occasional hits of such bloody damage, including several knock-<br>
downs, that they finally took to their heels and disappeared,<br>
glad to so easily retire from a bad scrape endangering their<br>
lives.<br>
<br>
Barton compared Joab in that fight to a whirl wind,so
rapid were his movements and unerring his projectiles and<br>
the restaurant keeper told me that he had never before witnessed<br>
so fierce and speedy an encounter and never expected to again.<br>
<br>
Detective reports on Morgan's threats of retaliation<br>
continued to reach me up to December, 1888. The attempt to<br>
burn the Ledger building and plant was made on Christmas night<br>
of that year, the building being then abandoned by the printers<br>
and staff, darkened and locked. A new and skillful forged<br>
jimmy was used by the incendiaries to effect an entrance which<br>
was done by prying open a window of the editorial rooms in the<br>
second story, north side, from a footing on the top platform<br>
of the outside stairway leading down to the yard at the rear.<br>
<br>
The desks were broken open and rifled and their paper<br>
contents, documents, etc., which had probably been examined by<br>
the villains were found scattered over the floor, partially<br>
burned.<br>
<br>
The jimmy was found where it had been used. The fire department, soon getting action after the first alarm, quickly<br>
extinguished the blaze, only small damage, confined to the<br>
editorial rooms, resulting. A single hour's delay of the firemen<br>
would have been enough for destruction of the composing room<br>
and press rooms on the south side of the building.<br>
<br>
The safe in the business office had not been touched and<br>
nothing of value was missing from any part of the building,<br>
showing conclusively, in addition to the fire, that robbery<br>
was not an object sought.<br>
<br>
The Ledger offered, and for a long time kept standing in<br>
its columns, its reward of $1,000 for information leading to<br>
arrest and conviction of the guilty party, and Colonel J. M.<br>
Steele added his offer of $500 for the like object--both<br>
in vain.<br>

of vice in all of its disgusting and hideous forms.<br>
<br>
Her rapid growth in the last half of the 80's and generally acknowledged claim to be the destined Liverpool of the Pacific Coast, while causing steady influx here of large numbers of worthy people, including substantial capitalists, were found to be attracting also in larger numbers, the criminals parasites of society.<br>
<br>
In summer when the Tacoma Daily Ledger was still quite<br>
young, 1883, or perchance 1884, there appeared in one of the shack<br>
storerooms of cheese cloth and paper walls that had for some<br>
time been vacant in block 704, a few doors north of where the<br>
Donnelly Hotel now stands, a man of medium stature and weight<br>
(probably in the 40's) light complexion, eyes and hair, full<br>
brown beard, quiet and deliberate mein, and remarkably few<br>
words, modestly but well clad.<br>
<br>
In passing I casually noted him and the otherwise
unoccupied room, observing that there was no stock of merchan-<br>
dise or other sign of business purpose there evident. Meet-<br>
ing a Ledger reporter I inquired about the case, and he told<br>
me that the stranger was a tin-horn gambler of the worst<br>
type.<br>
<br>
If he explained what kind of a gambler he was I totally for-<br>
got. But I probably assumed it to be a very wicked kind,<br>
for I remember to have expressed desire that the gambler be<br>
induced to leave town.<br>
<br>
Paper Fought Tin-Horn<br>
<br>
After a short but vigorous campaign of exposure by the<br>
reporter through the columns of the Ledger in articles<br>
headed "The Tin-Horn Must Go," he left, and we did not see<br>
him again for a long time. But in two or three years he came<br>
back with a bigger sack than he had before, entrenched him-<br>
self on the eastern side of Pacific Avenue, about opposite<br>
the location of his first venture from which he had been driven,<br>
and on a site since covered by the Olympus Hotel.<br>
<br>
There, with a drinking saloon and gambling hall in<br>
adjoining rooms, a low variety theater called the Comique<br>
in the rear, and a brass band, he inflicted upon our city<br>
during a period of three or four years to day of his death in<br>
April, 1890, literally a terrible scourge of vice, immensely<br>
to the degradation and permanent injury of a large number of<br>
our men and boys and to the blackening of the community reputation throughout the country and abroad.<br>
<br>
That was Henry S. Morgan, alias the notorious Harry Morgan,<br>
familiar with southwestern stage routes and Colorado state<br>
institutions, and carrying in his limp and shuffling gait the<br>
perpetual mark of a pal's vengeance.<br>
<br>
Gaming Was Open<br>
<br>
All of the games usual in such dives--faro, roulette,<br>
poker, craps and the rest--were played in Morgan's gambling<br>
rooms. Every night those apartments were filled until a very<br>
late hour. It was reported that upwards of 500 men had many<br>
times crowded in there and that most of them played. It was<br>
a fast-speed money maker. His wealth was variously estim-<br>
ated as high as a million dollars. Testimony of Frank Cantwell,<br>
one of the employees, relating to Morgan's estate, was that<br>
on an average the house won from $20,000 to $30,000 a month.<br>
<br>
But a large percentage of the winnings and grabbings was taken<br>
by dealers and other employees and the balance for the most<br>
part expended in bad investments, bribery of police and other<br>
officials, court expenses and lawyers' fees, and in dispensing<br>
gifts of coin to maintain backing against the press and other
protesting influences. So that at the windup the Morgan estate<br>
was found to have shrunk to $28,000.<br>
<br>
In the operation of the dive there was an ever present<br>
rough actor known as a bouncer, a brutal shoulder hitter,<br>
ready to battle beyond recognition with his powerful fist the<br>
face of any poor devil who having been robbed by a dealer,<br>
demanded restitution.<br>
<br>
All such victims--and the number was not a few--if insis-<br>
tant on their claims for recovery, were ruthlessly thrown or<br>
kicked into the street by the hired bouncer and the police<br>
were kept well out of the way by the chief. There were also<br>
among the hangers-on of the dive known ex convicts eager for al-<br>
most any job that required daring and afforded god pay, ready<br>
to execute the will of the silent boss.<br>
<br>
Missed Their Man<br>
<br>
Two masked men shot and killed Enoch Crosby, a peaceable<br>
and worthy young citizen, at C and South 6th Streets, mistak-<br>
ing him, as suspected by others, for Nelson Bennett. Ex-<br>
convicts, forced upon the Ledger editorial rooms and set fire<br>
to the building. Loggers and other strangers were drugged and<br>
robbed in Morgan's resort--the like was of frequent occurrence.<br>
Men made drunk and stupefied to insensibility by Morgan's bad<br>
whiskey were rolled in his dive and their purses lifted.<br>
<br>
The brass band, sitting on the open air balcony erected<br>
for that purpose over the front entrance, discoursed beautiful<br>
music in early evening for drawing the crowd to guzzle, gamble<br>
and play. The balcony in the theater was divided into convenient boxes so screened that while the occupants commanded<br>
full view of the audience and stage, they were invisible from<br>
without.<br>
<br>
These boxes were industriously worked by pretty women for<br>
the sale of wine, beer and other liquors at high prices, the<br>
charge for poor wine being $5 a bottle and beer $1 a bottle or<br>
25 cents a drink; these comely female "box rustlers," as they<br>
were called, earning a big rake off for inducing the men to<br>
buy while seeking engagements for later in the night.<br>
<br>
Backsliders There<br>
<br>
By reason of the effective concealment of the box<br>
interiors, they were often the resort of prominent citizens<br>
and lax church members, weak enough to be attracted by the vulgar novelty of the disgusting plays there enacted, and who at<br>
close of the entertainment carefully threaded their uncertain<br>
steps through devious and unlighted passages to alley or other<br>
unobserved outlet with hat pulled down and face muffled against<br>
recognition.
In that time practically all of the other numerous drink-<br>
ing saloons in Tacoma were also gambling dens, but they did not<br>
roll the drunks, or drug, rob or bounce their patrons. The<br>
foremost of them, next to the Comique, was the Paragon, located<br>
on the east side of Pacific Avenue, between 10th and 11th<br>
Streets, which did a large and profitable business.<br>
<br>
But the number of gambling places was held rigidly<br>
against increase by reason of the Comique influence in the<br>
city council, one member of which body was himself a saloon-<br>
keeper.<br>
<br>
For Town's Good<br>
<br>
No new gambling resort could be opened in Tacoma with-<br>
out first having obtained Morgan's consent in order to pro-<br>
cure a license. That influence was due largely to merchants<br>
who contending that their profitable sales depended on running<br>
a "wide open town" exerted their pressure accordingly and continuously on the council and police department.<br>
<br>
The wide open town attracted loggers and other laboring<br>
men desiring amusement and a few days off for a drinking bout,<br>
and was assumed to be a distinct and valuable asset of local<br>
business opportunity. How the Ledger regarded and treated<br>
that sophistry was seen in the following editorial paragraph<br>
which appeared in the issue of June 29, 1888:<br>
<br>
"The chief of police is quoted as favoring the licensing<br>
of gambling houses and as guaranteeing to 'run the works'<br>
satisfactorily. By all means, we suggest that stealing also<br>
be licensed. The license should be fixed low enough to permit<br>
thieves to make a fair profit. They will then frequent Tacoma<br>
and buy their supplies from Tacoma 'merchants.'<br>
<br>
The chief of police could be relied upon to 'run the works' and see that just enough stealing be done to promote the public welfare<br>
and encourage thieves to come to Tacoma and spend their money<br>
with the 'merchants' here. The criminal law should always be<br>
enforced with due regard to the wishes of the 'merchants.'<br>
<br>
It must also be borne in mind that the welfare of a community<br>
depends largely upon the amount of money obtained by gambling<br>
and stealing from those who earn it and shared by gamblers and<br>
thieves with the 'merchants' who encourage and applaud the<br>
crimes by which the money is obtained. A community thoroughly<br>
imbued with these principles and possessed of a chief of police<br>
desirous of carrying them out is certain to be hap. Blessed<br>
is Tacoma."<br>
<br>
Citizens Were Enraged<br>
<br>
Accentuating the seriousness of the situation--the grave
concern and apprehension of the public at large--the common<br>
council of the city in its helpfulness and dismay was desper-<br>
ately wrestling in a slough of despond with the tangle of<br>
divided responsibility due to weak and inefficient enactments<br>
affecting saloons and gambling, and there was much talk of call-<br>
ing a mass meeting to deal with the persistent encroachment of<br>
the criminals who were- believed to be running the town.<br>
<br>
Exposure by the Tacoma Daily Ledger of the unlawful prac-<br>
tices and crimes that were committed at the Comique and denun-<br>
ciations of the proprietor and all other persons appearing to<br>
be responsible for them, including the police and city council<br>
had proceeded steadily for months in the fall of 1888, when<br>
verbal threats, authoritatively declared by detectives in my<br>
employ, to have been uttered by Morgan, began to reach me.<br>
<br>
The Ledger, he asserted, was making it very costly for him<br>
and he was not going to stand for it. A detective reported<br>
that one of Morgan's ex-convict attendants had urged him to<br>
make a raid on the Ledger office and clean it out. To this<br>
suggestion he replied: "Don't take me for a greenhorn; there<br>
are more guns up there than our crowd could face and they'd<br>
begin shooting on sight."<br>
<br>
In the same year Albert E. Joab, a graduate of Yale Univer-<br>
sity and member of the bar, arrived in Tacoma from Denver,<br>
Colorado, and accepted tender of a position as reporter on the<br>
Daily Ledger. In his canvass for news he did not neglect the<br>
fruitful source of the Comique which was subjected to exploit<br>
without much intermission by the local department of the paper<br>
as well as held under fire of the editorial columns.<br>
<br>
His keen penetration and understanding of events and his<br>
training in the use of good English and graphic forms of<br>
speech rendered strikingly clear and forcible his reports of<br>
the news gathered by him and so it happened that he daily<br>
struck stinging and hurtful blows at the peace and prospects<br>
of that common enemy of the city's well being and fair name.<br>
<br>
Gamblers Made Overtures<br>
<br>
As a consequence Morgan "had it in for him," and took<br>
occasion to call and see me at my office in Campbell and Powell's<br>
building, 936 Pacific Avenue, and complain about the hostile<br>
course pursued by Mr. Joab.<br>
<br>
By that interview and practical invitation to more friendly<br>
relations my visitor had hoped to avert the necessity for<br>
risking the violent and criminal expedients which he had in<br>
contemplation. But his complaint and overture generally being<br>
ignored by me, we soon heard further from the aggrieved party<br>
on two signal occasions.<br>

An attack on Mr. Joab by two thugs he had never seen before<br>
had been cunningly staged to take place early in the evening<br>
in a quiet restaurant little frequented, on the east side of<br>
Pacific Avenue a few doors north of 10th Street, where for a<br>
considerable time it had been his custom to take his dinner in<br>
the company of Charles Barton, the city editor.<br>
<br>
The two friends were seated at a table awaiting service<br>
of the dinner ordered by them and the proprietor was behind the<br>
counter, no others being present.<br>
<br>
Appeared then the two thugs, low browed, dark visaged and<br>
of generally forbidding appearance, resembling ignorant foreigners.<br>
<br>
Entering together, they immediately directed offensive<br>
and vulgar language at Mr. Joab with the evident object of<br>
provoking a fight. As well the lighted match to gun powder.<br>
His quick wit named to him the party who had sent these<br>
desperadoes, and why, and made it seem certain that they would<br>
get him if he failed to overcome and drive them out. He<br>
was without weapon of any kind and Barton did not move to<br>
his assistance, being timid from memory of a killing back<br>
east done by him in self defense. Hence, quick as a flash,<br>
Joab opened and continued in lead of the fight--in fact did all<br>
of the fighting by hurling the dishes especially heavy sugar<br>
bowls.<br>
<br>
He thus held both of the ruffians at a safe distance<br>
away from him where they could not use their knives and<br>
kept them busy dodging his fearful missiles. But he made<br>
occasional hits of such bloody damage, including several knock-<br>
downs, that they finally took to their heels and disappeared,<br>
glad to so easily retire from a bad scrape endangering their<br>
lives.<br>
<br>
Barton compared Joab in that fight to a whirl wind,so<br>
rapid were his movements and unerring his projectiles and<br>
the restaurant keeper told me that he had never before witnessed<br>
so fierce and speedy an encounter and never expected to again.<br>
<br>
Detective reports on Morgan's threats of retaliation<br>
continued to reach me up to December, 1888. The attempt to<br>
burn the Ledger building and plant was made on Christmas night<br>
of that year, the building being then abandoned by the printers<br>
and staff, darkened and locked. A new and skillful forged<br>
jimmy was used by the incendiaries to effect an entrance which<br>
was done by prying open a window of the editorial rooms in the<br>
second story, north side, from a footing on the top platform<br>
of the outside stairway leading down to the yard at the rear.<br>
<br>
The desks were broken open and rifled and their paper<br>
contents, documents, etc., which had probably been examined by<br>
the villains were found scattered over the floor, partially
burned.<br>
<br>
The jimmy was found where it had been used. The fire department, soon getting action after the first alarm, quickly<br>
extinguished the blaze, only small damage, confined to the<br>
editorial rooms, resulting. A single hour's delay of the firemen<br>
would have been enough for destruction of the composing room<br>
and press rooms on the south side of the building.<br>
<br>
The safe in the business office had not been touched and<br>
nothing of value was missing from any part of the building,<br>
showing conclusively, in addition to the fire, that robbery<br>
was not an object sought.<br>
<br>
The Ledger offered, and for a long time kept standing in<br>
its columns, its reward of $1,000 for information leading to<br>
arrest and conviction of the guilty party, and Colonel J. M.<br>
Steele added his offer of $500 for the like object--both<br>
in vain.<br>

Jim Erickson, "There's a creak and a clatter...." <B>The Tacoma News. Tribune.</B> October 31, 1981.<br>
<br>
Tonight is Halloween, when costumed ghosts, goblins and other su-
pernatural - creatures roam the streets for treats.<br>
<br>
But that is just one night a year.  One Tacoma family has spirits in their house all year 'round.<br>
<br>
Fortunately, the spirits have not harmed anyone.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Usher (not her real name) and her middle-aged daughter, Mrs. Price (not her real name), said the strange happenings started shortly after they moved into the house 13 years ago.<br>
<br>
"The doorbell rang at 4 in the morning," said Mrs. Usher.  "It frightened me because there was no  doorbell, only wires hanging and nothing was connected."<br>
<br>
Mrs. Price said she tried to recreate the ringing by placing the wires together and nothing happened.<br>
<br>
Until about two years ago, events occurred on an almost daily basis, they said.<br>
<br>
"I wouldn't sleep in my bedroom for quite a few years because the light in the walk-in closet would switch on and off by itself in the middle of the night," Mrs. Usher said.<br>
<br>

Mrs. Price said there were only a couple of times when she got really scared.<br>
<br>
Once was. when she heard a scratching sound on the inside back door late at, night, but the next day found no visible marks on the door.<br>
<br>
The other, she said, was when she thought she saw the shadow of a man on the basement wall as she gazed down the steps. The police were called out on that one, she added, because of concern that there might but   a burglar. But the police found nothing.<br>
<br>
Other events have included: Cups and a heavy cast-iron lid flying across the kitchen, towels and other items disappearing then turning up in strange places, knocks on the doors and metal clanging sounds under the living room floor.<br>
<br>
They said a fortune teller once told them, after reading some cards, that a woman had been murdered in the basement of the house by ber husband.<br>
                                             
"But I'm not convinced of that," Mrs. Usher said.  "I've talked to my neighbors who have been here many years and they don't remember anything like that."<br>
<br>
Mrs. Price said one time she felt someone push her and she fell across the bed.  "It was a small hand, like a woman."<br>
<br>
She also recounted an unusual incident when her daughter and a<br>
friend had a slumber party.<br>
<br>
"I had tucked them in and they were in their night clothes," Mrs. Price said.  "But when they got up in the morning they were fully clothed.  And they didn't know how that happened."<br>
<br>
Her son, George (not his real name), interrupted to say that he had returned home late one night and  found both doors locked.  He knocked on the door to have someone open it and someone did.  But everyone in the house was sleeping.  He didn't know who unlocked the door.<br>
<br>
"You neyer mentioned that before," Mrs. Price exclaimed.  But he isn't the kind to volunteer such things normally, she noted.<br>
A number of times, people reported hearing voices call their names, she said.<br>
<br>
The events diminished about two years ago, after she mentioned these events under hypnosis, Mrs. Price said.<br>
<br>
"I'm glad they did," Mrs. Usher said.  "This has changed me   I'm fearful of them (ghosts). I sure don't want them around,"<br>
But Mrs. Price said she kind of misses them because she, felt they were looking after her..<br>
<br>
"I figured it was just Uncle Chad (not his real name)," she said.  Uncle Chad has been dead for 20 years.<br>

Kathleen Merryman, "Historic Haunts" <B>The Tacoma News Tribune.</B> October 31, 1992<br>
<br>
Of the 5,624 souls who populate Steilacoom, about two dozen don't show up on the census.  Washington's oldest incorporated town, and the oldest port in what was Washington Territory, cherishes its past.  It also provides a home away from home for a few residents who just can't seem to move on.  It is a spirited place, a ghost-friendly town.<br>
<br>
The residents of Steilacoom, who are wise enough to have pinned the town's future to its past, recognize the asset in their ethereal comrades.<br>
<br>
Just last week, historian and writer Jack Sage led two ghost tours of the town.  Three dozen people, armed with flashlights and the willies, followed him along Starling Street and Champion Street and Union Avenue, past the haunts of overly loyal residents, and, according to old religious beliefs, straight along the border where one reality joins another.<br>
<br>
Richard Overman, professor of religion at the University of Puget Sound, counts himself among those who do believe in the ghosts behind Sage's tales.<br>
<br>
Take the strange case of J.M. Bates, who lived on the edge of poverty in the middle of the last century, and strolls along the edge of reality in this century.<br>
<br>
Bates, who lived on the edge of poverty in the middle of the last century, and strolls along the edge of reality in this century.<br>
<br>
Bates was neither intelligent nor prosperous, Sage said.<br>
<br>

"But he had a cow, and this cow was his pride and joy," Sage added.  "It was the only possession he really had.  And then it turned up missing one day."<br>
<br>
In those days, before the railroad sidetracked the town's dream of growing into a prosperous terminal city, Steilacoom was a booming place, its main street lined with saloons and hotels catering to the needs of laboring men.  Word traveled fast in the saloons, and anyone who needed information knew to go there for it, which is what Bates did.<br>
<br>
"One of the men said, 'I saw Andrew Byrd take your cow to the slaughterhouse,"' Sage related.<br>
<br>
Byrd was a prosperous miller, with a sawmill and a gristmill off of Chambers Creek, and a slaughterhouse not far away.  Byrd came to Steilacoom several times a week, and always stopped at the post office.<br>
<br>
That's where Bates found him.<br>
<br>
"Bates saw Andrew Byrd and said 'What did you do wit my cow?' Andrew said 'You'll have to go elsewhere.  I don't know anything about it.' Bates was upset, and he got a gun and shot Byrd twice," Sage said.<br>
<br>
It took Byrd a day to die, and in that time, he spoke up for Bates.<br>
<br>
"Before he died, he said 'Don't do anything to that man.  He's a little retarded.' They put Bates in the jail on Starling Street, and that night between 100 and 150 of the town's citizens decided to do something about it," Sage said.  "They broke into the jail and locked up the sheriff.  They took Bates out and found a barn and hanged him.  The man who told him the false information got scared and left for Oregon."<br>
<br>

Bates, however, remained.<br>
<br>
"The story is that on moonlit nights you will still see Bates going around the streets with a hangman's noose around his neck, trailing a rope and looking for his cow.  He may be up by the jail or down by the saloons or up by Steilacoom Lake," Sage said.<br>
<br>
But the moon is always out.<br>
<br>
It could be the moon that lifts the fog between his world and this one, according to Overman's theory and beliefs.. held by religions around the globe.<br>
<br>
European pagans and the Christians who converted them find common ground in their explanation of visits from the netherworld.<br>
<br>
"There is a time when time and space crack open and the connection between this world and the next world is easier to pass through.  A veil lifts, and you can go through.  A door opens, and there is passage back and forth," Overman said.  He noted that the Old Testament tale of Jacob's Ladder, which angels used to climb from heaven to earth, offers up the same image.<br>
<br>
Overman tells of the night he believes his grandmother made the passage.  He had been asleep, but he awoke to find her standing by bis bed.<br>
<br>
"She had a number for me, a seven-digit number. 1,518,321.  What it means, I don't know-.  Is this the number of angels that can dance on the head of a pin?"' asked the scholar of religion.<br>
<br>
If his grandmother's visit was just a dream, he said, it was far more dazzling than any he experienced before or since -- so dazzling that he got out of bed lind. wrote the number down.<br>
<br>
'She was kindly and much as I remember her, except that, when she was alive, she was never very much interested in numbers.<br>
<br>
"If Grandmother Overman was a ghost, she made one of the most common types of visits across the way -- an appearance to a loved one, with a piece of advice or reassuring information.
One of the commonest themes is that someone dies or is killed and immediately thereafter appears to someone in the family.  Usually the people are entirely skeptical, and think what is going on here?' The message conveyed more often than not is, 'Don't worry, I'm all right,"' Overman said.<br>
<br>
These gentle visits, he said, are the stories that constantly increase the ranks of those who believe in ghosts.<br>
<br>
"You only have to see one white crow to know that they are not all black," he said.  "Even in this ordinary world of time and space, the transmission medium is much more mysterious than we would like to think."<br>
<br>
The patterns of these experiences, he noted, reflects the larger pattern of the order of heaven and earth outlined by many major religions.  Mortals pray to saints or ancestors in the belief that they can intercede for the living.<br>
<br>
Which is not to say that an the souls left behind are kindly, or even complete, Overman said.<br>
<br>
"In religious stories about the afterlife the same process is always described.  At the moment of death, even though you may be faithfully religious, you end your earthly life plastered over with impurities.  These must be stripped away in the process of your ascent toward heaven.  It is like the process of ascent of a NASA space rocket.  The part that will arrive is a teeny little part.  The rest is excess baggage that has to be blown away.  A lot of that stuff which is blown back becomes space junk which is now dangerous.<br>
<br>
"In the ascent of the human soul toward heaven or the creator, there is a lot that's stripped away that behaves like space junk," Overman said.  "When you have ghosts that come back and cause problems generation after generation, I think that it's the leftover bits and pieces of some soul the rest of which may be elsewhere."<br>
<br>
That may be what one woman encountered, and later told Sage about<br>
<br>
She lives in a relatively new house built over the spot where a much older house once stood.<br>
<br>

"At night a light upstairs would go on for no reason, and they would hear footsteps, " Sage said.<br>
<br>
"They would go upstairs to investigate and find nothing."<br>
<br>
The lights would flash on when they were not at home, and the footsteps would tread on the fears of those who thought they were alone in the house.  In time, Sage said, it all got to be too much for the woman.<br>
<br>
"She heard the footsteps and went to the stairs and shouted 'Go away.  I don't want you anymore.  You're scaring me.' After that, it didn't happen any more," Sage said, recounting a story told to him after the ghost tour.<br>
<br>
Overman theorized that the bit of afterlife junk needed that extra push to be sent out of this realm.  Facing down a ghost often works.<br>
<br>
But not always.<br>
<br>
"It can happen that a lot of stuff can congeal into a malicious form with all the bad parts of a person, and you get a bad ghost hanging around he said.<br>
<br>
That doesn't mean that the person was nasty - just that the good parts went on.<br>
<br>
"A fragment of a personality can still be able to cause physical effects.  The character can vary all0 the way from a concentrated bag of evil to something with the maliciousness of a 3-year-old child," Overman said.<br>
<br>
Some can be disposed of as easily as teubg the footsteps to scram.<br>
<br>
Others fight back.<br>
<br>
Overman is convinced that ghosts can do great damage.  Europe is full of legends that back him up.<br>
<br>

Sage said he's heard of ghosts with the ability to chill - like old E.R. Rogers, who is regularly seen rocking in a chair looking out the north window of the mansion he built People who have tried to live m the house he built - then lost along with his fortune - say it is Rogers who keeps the chair by the window - even if they move the chair into a closet.  They say he doesn't want them there, and that, frankly, he's lousy company.<br>
<br>
And Sage has beard of ghosts who seemed linked to territory more than buildings - visitors to his house have reported seeing a woman and a dog that shouldn't be in the residence buat in 1963.  He thinks she's a memory of the time the site was occupied by bootleggers.<br>
<br>
But he hasn't beard of any evil ghosts at work in Steflacoom.  Even in the old days, when the saloons and hotels went bust and decayed along the track and every kid in town knew they were haunted, no one felt threatened, Sage &-ud.  They just let the spirits be.<br>
<br>
"Ghosts like vacant buildings," Sage explained.  "They don't bother people as much as people bother them."<br>

Some people don't think ghosts are a laughing matter.<br>

Ask a guard at the Historical Society Museum: Who is riding the elevator when he is locked in, alone, at night?<br>
<br>
Ask the maintenance men at Old City Hall: What turns off the lights in the tower and rings the bells?<br>
<br>
Police were called there repeatedly one night this month.  Break-in and fire alarms were being set off, with no logical explanation.  Lights were flicked on in rooms that should have been empty.  Guards said they were chasing shadow's.  No intruders were found.<br>
<br>
In the tower of Old City Hall hang four huge bells, donated in 1904 by ex.Ambassador and Mrs. Hugh C. Wallace in memory of their late daughter, 12 years old.<br>
<br>
The 60-pound bell clappers are connected by rods to the clock mechanism below.  Manager Jim Brewster says the striking mechanism has been disengaged.  Yet the bells ring in the night.<br>
<br>
Suspecting pranksters, Brewster one night slept in the tower near the bells.<br>
<br>
"I can tell you in all honesty, there is a spirit up here," Brewster said afterward.  "Have you ever been alone somewlier'e and -you knew somebody was standing near you?"<br>
<br>
At the museum, a guard said he left the elevator at the first floor one night while he made his rounds outside.  He locked tile door behind him.<br>

Circling the building and entering up the hill at the third floor, he found the elevator waiting for him.  He doesn't think he uncon-

<br>
A man who used to live in an old house on North Sixth Street tells this story:<br>
<br>

Residents used to be awakened by a clattering noise," like clicking teeth coming from mid-air in the darkened living room.  The noise stopped while the lights, were on, resumed with them off,<br>

PIERCE COUNTY COURT HOUSE<br>
<br>
Paul Dumas, "Ghosts sported half century about county hanging room, dusty, dingy attic fit romping place for two specters,"<B> Tacoma News Tribune.</B> April 7, 1959.<br>
<br>
They're quiet and pensive now, those tortured ghosts of two wife killers who for more than a half a century sported about the Hangman's Room in the old County Court House.  The Court House is nearly empty now and there is no one about to tell stories about the two mischievous specters. In time they'll perish from memory and their diaphanous shrouds will become just one more casualty of the big move into the ghost proof bright lights of the new County<br>
County City Building.<br>
<br>
Their home was the dusty and dingy attic in the old Court House. It was a fit romping place for the two spectral figures. It was from its lofty ceiling, from one of its massive beams, in fact, that the two murderers passed from their vale of tears into the limbo of court house legend.<br>
<br>
Conversation Piece<br>
<br>
The old attic, which for many years had housed old records figured prominently in the stories of old court house hands have been telling. The Hangman's Room was the court house's conversation piece, so to speak.<br>
<br>
The stories recently were making the rounds of the County offices again, revived by memories of tales handed down from generation to generation of County office employees. The stories, getting a bit hoary from repetition, gained a bit of color from a liberal sprinkling of imagination, itself stimulated by the poring over of old documents stored in the Hangman's Room lo these many years.<br>
<br>
Five floors up and away off in the northeast corner of the massive pile of masonry that has served as the seat of County government for so long the attic served as a hideaway for old criminal dockets, court records, land abstracts, school records and whatnot. Some date back to the day the building was opened, June 21, 1893.<br>
<br>
Do it Yourself Days.<br>
<br>
The built of these documents didn't cross the street to the new County City Building. But before they were destroyed they had to be identified and read. Result of all this preoccupation with the past was the revival of stories and anecdotes about early County history<br>
<br>
This was the period when county sheriffs were required to dispose
of convicted murderers themselves. This was before Walla. The sheriff couldn't pass the buck, or rope, if you please, and had to see to it that the grisly business was performed in his own bailiwick.<br>
<br>
As for the two wife killers, there are many versions of their place in County criminal history. Facts are hard to pin down, almost as hard as it is to catch a glimpse of the Hangman's Room ghosts.<br>
<br>
Curious Sheriff.<br>
<br>
Sheriff Frank Stojack, a new comer in Court house circles had heard about the ghosts. So one day he decided to visit the attic and soak up a bit of the atmosphere that hangs about the Hangman's Room like an evanescent haze.<br>
<br>
Stojack wanted to see for himself if there was still any evidence that anyone had ever swung to his reward from the hug, age mellowed beams which help buttress the lofty, gabled roof. There was noting.<br>
<br>
But still there were the stories.<br>
<br>
Undersheriff Glen Talbot had heard them too. So had Joe Sladek, investigator for the county prosecutor. And Jailer Wayne Dittman, who is something of a life long student, for want of a better word, of executions, also had his version of the stories.<br>
<br>
Stories they Tell.<br>
<br>
One story is that one man and one woman were executed in the attic. Another said only one person was hanged. still another had two mounting those thirteen steps. Then there were the tales which let you fill in your own number.<br>
<br>
Finally Jailer Dittman came along to spoil the whole thing with the statement that the hangings weren't performed in the attic at all, but right in the jail itself. Dittman's authority, he said, was an old timer, now dead, who worked  in the court house at the turn of the century when the hangings supposedly took place.<br>
<br>
"They swung right in here," he said, referring to the foyer like area just inside the barred jail gate.<br>
<br>
"They named that room the hangman's room because that's where he stayed during the hanging. It was from that room that he pulled the cord that triggered the trip to the gallows.<br>
<br>
"You see, no one know who the hangman was. It was important that his identify remain secret. That's why he was alone up in the attic. The rope, incidentally, hung rom the ceiling up there. It dropped five floors through the shaft."<br>

Dittman pointed out a steel door, now frozen shut, through which prisoners went to climb a spiral stairway to the court rooms above. This staircase long ago was sealed off.<br>
<br>
Dittman is off the mark, of course. Room 506 indeed was used as a hanging chamber, according to a document on file at the Washington State Museum.<br>
<br>
The True Facts.<br>
<br>
On April 6, 1900, at 7:10 a.m., a man known as Albert Michaud dropped into eternity from the gallows erected in this room for the slaying of his former wife.<br>
<br>
Michaud, a French-Canadian, was convicted of killing Mrs. John Amber as she tried to flee from him when he visited her home. Records have it that Michaud tried to commit suicide on the spot by putting the gun to his mouth and pulling the trigger. The revolver was empty and he was seized before he could reload.<br>
<br>
Michaud's execution was presided over by the Pierce County Sheriff, a man named Mills. About eighty persons witnessed the grim affair. Mills, a careful gentleman made sure of a professional job by going to Spokane to learn the techniques of hanging at an execution scheduled there.<br>
<br>
The story goes that Michaud, a black haired man at the time of the conviction suffered so much from fear that when he appeared at his execution his hair was snow white.<br>
<br>
The Musician<br>
<br>
The second and last hanging in Room 506 was that of Eben L. Boyce, a wander musician, drunkard and former member of the United States Army at Manila. Boyce, on February 10, 1900, when to a restaurant where his estranged wife was employed, drew a revolver and shot the woman as she ran for a private booth.  Tried and found guilt of the brutal killing, Boyce was hanged August, 9, 1901.<br>
<br>
The condemned slayer, it was reported at the time tried to meet his doom calmly, but made a poor job of it. The story is that he would have collapsed but for the presence of Father Hylebos who accompanied boyce to the gallows. Seventy persons saw Boyce stretch in the Hangman's Room.<br>
<br>
These were the only hangings held in the court house.  The ghosts of Michaud and Boyce have had a long mischievous career since that time supplying grist for court house story tellers.<br>
<br>
Their day in the sun, or gloom, is over. Soon, the Hangman's Room will be no more.<br>
<br>

Ray D. Penny, "Court House steeped in history of Tacoma," <B>The Tacoma Sunday Ledger.</B> May 22, 1955. (excerpts).<br>
<br>
Besides all of the comedy and tragedy the old court house has witnessed, the building has had its own secrets and mysteries. One of these was a secret, winding stairway that led from the jail on the first floor to a judges's chambers on the third floor. It was built for dangerous prisoners, to prevent their escape or to protect them from mob violence or a jail delivery. It is said that the last time it was used for this purpose was for a man named Newcomb and his companion, a Mrs. 'Quanshaw, both of whom were finally convicted of murdering the woman's husband.<br>
<br>
The upper portion of this secret stairway was torn out years ago, but the lower portion is still in use. It leads from County Clerk Robert L. Dykman's quarters to storage rooms beneath the first floor where a vast accumulation of county records are filed away....<br>
<br>
The beginning of the end for this fine old building came April 13, 1949 when an earthquake caused ominous cracks in the great tower. The county commissioners declared the tower damaged beyond repair and pointed out that the whole interior was something of a fire menace and would soon have to be rebuilt.<br>
<br>
But many Tacomans, proud of that old land mark looming up above the city felt differently about the tower and formed the Pierce County Preservation League to try to save it.  This battle was lost and the tower was razed. And now the old court house itself will soon pass into oblivion.<br>
<br>
Many Tacomans will view its passing with sincere regret, but many more, no doubt, will be looking forward with keen anticipation to the new County City building which will take its place on the Tacoma skyline.<br>

<br>
Are their Ghosts in Tacoma?<br>
<br>
Ask the maintenance men at Old City Hall: What turns off the lights in the tower and rings the bells?<br>
<br>
Police were called there repeatedly one night this month.  Break-in and fire alarms were being set off, with no logical explanation.  Lights were flicked on in rooms that should have been empty.  Guards said they were chasing shadow's.  No intruders were found.<br>
<B><br>

In the tower </B>of Old City Hall hang four huge bells, donated in 1904 by ex.Ambassador and Mrs. Hugh C. Wallace in memory of their late daughter, 12 years old.<br>
<br>
The 60-pound bell clappers are connected by rods to the clock mechanism below.  Manager Jim Brewster says the striking mechanism has been disengaged.  Yet the bells ring in the night.<br>
<br>
Suspecting pranksters, Brewster one night slept in the tower near the bells.<br>
<br>
"I can tell you in all honesty, there is a spirit up here," Brewster said afterward.  "Have you ever been alone somewhere and you knew somebody was standing near you?"<br>

THE WIDOW'S GHOST.<br>
<br>
Berthe Knatvold, "Even Tacoma has her shivery stories," <B>The Tacoma Sunday Ledger.</B> October 29, 1911. p. 15.<br>
<br>
There was once a fair in Tacoma had many novel features, among which was a tremendously handsome Turk, as Turks go, who had charge of the streets of Cairo concession.<br>
<br>
There was also a widow, fair, fat and forty,  who had much money in the bank and a weakness for handsome brown eyes in her heart.<br>
<br>
Now  there being a law of supply and demand that works in affairs of the heart and pocketbook just as well as it does in the grocery business and the stock market, the widow chanced upon the Turk's handsome eyes, and the Turk learned all the particulars of a dead husband's loving provision against the widow's future want.<br>
<br>
She came at once to the conclusion that she must have those brown velvet eyes. The Turk arrived quickly and certainly to a respectful appreciation of the widow's bank account. So in the parlance of such affairs, they arrived at a settlement.<br>
<br>
She was to have his eyes and he was to have her money. Only his eyes were to remain in his head to light from there the fires in her middle aged heart while her gold was to shed its comfort upon him via a transfer in bank account.<br>
<br>
All was arranged. They were mutually enraptured. The vows were plighted, the eyes bespoke eternal fidelity, the money crackled comfortably in the Oriental's pocket in the shape of so many certified checks.<br>
<br>
The bridal pair boarded the train to seek a new home where their love could live forever unspoiled by the criticism of neighbors.<br>
<br>
Shortly after the wedding however the news was flashed back over the wires to Tacoma that the woman had fallen from a train while it was going at a sixty mile and hour gait and had been instantly ground in to fragments under the wheels.<br>
<br>
The Turkish groom sped on his way with his certified checks and his glorious eyes intact. And until the widow's house was destroyed it was said that a harrowing tragedy was enacted as though thrown upon the walls by a moving picture film every year on the anniversary of the accident.<br>
<br>
It was said that a shodow picture on the wall showed a fast moving
train and a women holding lovingly to the hand of a foreign looking man who came out onto the platform, looking down between the two cars at the grinding couplings which held them together.<br>
<br>
It was said that just as they approached the edge of the platform and she seemed to be saying something to the man, he slipped his hand from hers and gave her shoulders a shove which sent her body down into the yawning jaws of destruction between the two cars to be ground to bits under the iron wheels.<br>

HAUNTED  BROTHEL.<br>
<br>
Carol Lind, "Haunted Brothel, " <B>Western Gothic,</B> Seattle: Lind, 1983, p. 2<br>
<br>
Most people do not like to be identified with ghost stories.  At best, they will be called liars.  At worst, they are considered mental cases.  For those reasons the teller of the following tale desired  his  name  and  exact  location be withheld.<br>
<br>
In an old section of Seattle, as Georgetown, was a rundown house of the type built in the late 1890's.  It was a two story rambling structure, complete with attic, basement, tower, gables and broken windows.  A neglected porch with spikes missing in the railings like open spaces between rotting teeth fronted the lower face.<br>
<br>

Entrance was gained by carefully climb<B>ing </B>deteriorating steps.  Several seasons worth of decaying leaves had entwined with the unkept grass.  For a decade, the house had been vacant, victim to weather and vandals, a sanctuary fit only for ghosts.<br>
<br>
Such was the condition an art dealer found the house when he made a wrong turn onto a narrow hillside back street.  He envisioned a treasure in the rough, and burned with a passion to own and restore the antique which, as it turned out, was for sale.<br>
<br>
He asked a few questions of the realtor, with restoration plans in mind, and bought the house.  In the Fall of 1974, he moved in.<br>
The first night in the house he wandered through empty rooms, unwilling to share the sweet taste of acquisition which is known only to collectors.  He mentally assessed structure and wood and knew exactly how he would enhance the neglected beauty so marred by neighborhood children and bird droppings.<br>
<br>
The excitement of finding such a house, damaged by indifference but not by well-intentioned unknowledgeable antique fanciers, was so exciting he trembled, contributing his shivers to what would be, never once realizing what was actually in the strained dark silence of the upper bedroom.<br>
<br>
Reluctantly, he admitted to weariness, and went to his freshly made bed, disturbed only by the common sounds of a creaking house, until...<br>
<br>
"No!" A woman's voice shattered the quiet.  "No!"<br>
<br>
Abruptly, the art dealer sat up in his bed, and shivered from an
intense cold that penetrted to the bone, uncertain if he had been dreaming.  He heard a tremendous struggle upstairs as if furniture was overturned and a body flung against the wall.  Pleading, a cried out a name. The art dealer shuddered, for it was if the whole ceiling would burst apart under the  weight of the fight.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, the struggle ended as abruptly as the scream.  Soft weeping, seeped through the hallways, down the stairs, and up the walls to the ceiling until the house was filled with the frightened, helpless whimpering. He doubted what he had heard, tried to contribute - it to exhaustion and imgination, and remained in bed, unwilling to venture into the forbidding dark.<br>
<br>
When daylight flooded the unfurnished rooms, the art dealer felt childish, even silly, to have felt so frightened about a dream.  Yet, it had been remarkably real, so much so he investigated the barren room which in the harsh daylight sadly revealed how much restoration was needed.<br>
<br>
The sound, he reasoned, had apparently come from a second-floor corner bedroom.  In the autumn sunlight, the room did not appear to be singularly frightening.  It was empty with yellowed wallpaper, dirty windows, dusty woodwork and a curiously stained floor.  No furniture existed, although he had heard furniture overturned.<br>
<br>
Was it my imagination? he wondered<br>
<br>
The approach of night made the art dealer apprehensive.  The sense of vague disquiet was new to him, causing him to toss restlessly in bed.  At 12:30, the pitiful sounds echoed even louder fram the corner bedroom.  The weeping of a wounded, dying victim filtered into every room, to be absorbed by the walls and creating a life that made the house pulsate.  As disturbing as the art dealer found it, it was no longer fearful.  He felt the entity was not evil, but frightened, helpless and terribly alone.<br>
<br>
He began to wonder about his sanity, for he alone had heard the sounds.  If the house was reliving a past traumatic event, he needed witnesses.<br>
<br>
He asked friends to stay over the next night, and remained quiet about the ha ngs in the house.  Grateful for their companionship, he accepted suggestions about household improvements.  The conversation drifted to mutual interests.<br>
<br>
Suddenly the cry came from the corner bedroom followed by a life and<br>
<br>
and death struggle, the crash of furniture and the thud of a body.<br>
 
<br>
The art dealer glanced at his watch noting the time was 12:30.  The mysterious pleading was more audible.<br>
<br>
--No! Marmy! Manny! Oh, Manny ... why?"<br>
<br>
With the mournful weeping cam the seeping chill.  He looked at the shocked faces of his friends, and felt great joy they, too, had heard the sounds.  He was not mad afterall.<br>
<br>
"Every night at 12:30, " he remarked drily.  "You see, when I - bought the house, I apparently bought a ghost.  "<br>
<br>
"You're putting us on." A man laughed nervously.<br>
<br>
"I wish I were.  Come with me and I'll show you the haunted room. Feel free to explore this house, to find any hidden phonographs or other contraptions which might create such an illusion.  I would welcome it, to find someone has been playing a joke on me after all."<br>
<br>
Despite the exurberant search, no such trickery was found.  Only a lingering cold in the corner bedroom hinted of a secret beyond their experiences.<br>
<br>
Perplexed and anxious, the art dealer confronted the realtor who had  sold. him the house.  He still wanted to keep and restore the 
house, was even <B> </B>intrigued by its haunting, so inquires about the house's history.  Reluctantly, the realtor admitted previous owners had claimed to have heard muffled sounds of an intense struggle and a weeping voice that cried out to "Manny."<br>
<br>
"Apparently," he said off-handedly, "The incidents date back to 1910.  Terrified owners have quickly put the house on the market each time the ghost made her vocal appearance."<br>
<br>
The art dealer was too fascinated to sell-the house.  The ghost no longer frightened him.  Instead, he wanted to know who she was and why she died. He researched books about historical Seattle, talked to people who had known the city as it had been during the turn-of-the century, and strained his eyesight scanning library news clippings.<br>
<br>
Then he found the truth, by accident, in a narrow faded newspaper column.  In 1899, the Georgetown mansion had been a brothel.  In the upstairs corner bedroom, at 12:30 AM, a young Indian prostitute bad been brutally stabbed to death and horribly mutiliated.  The murderer had been her lover, Mamy.
The art dealer felt a cold chill seep up his spine, for while he did not fear prostitute, she was not alone in the bedroom.  The murderer was there, too.<br>

HAUNTED GOLF COURSE.<br>
<br>
Carol Lind, "Haunted Golf Course, " <B>Western Gothic,</B> Seattle: Lind, 1983, p. 2<br>
<br>
Golf courses are not traditionally haunted sites.  Yet, Seattle's Glenacres golf course, located in the area around 10th South and South 110th, has the dubious distinction of visitation by a mysterious manifestation.<br>
<br>
The first reported sighting was told twenty years ago.  In the time since, hundreds of people have reported the same description of a gaunt, naked Indian performing a twisting dance on the path to the golf course.<br>
<br>
While unusual, the real attention-getter is that this Shaman dances in the all-together, and turns and ducks in stylized gyrations, slightly hovering above the ground.<br>
<br>
For several years, Seattle-police have converged, at various intervals, to the site to catch the flasher.  Each tine, just as. police were upon the whirling and silently chanting Indian, he vanished without a trace.<br>
<br>
His message is unknown.  Why does he cling so tenaciously in spirit? Perhaps, a clue can be found in the Northwest Indian ghost-related culture.  The story persists that Glenacres course is located on an ancient Indian burial ground.<br>

<br>
STEILACOOM. GHOSTS.<br>
<br>
Kathleen Merryman, "Haunts," <B>The Tacoma News Tribune.</B> October 31, 1992.<br>
<br>
Of the 5,624 souls who populate Steilacoom, about two dozen don't show up on the census.  Washington's oldest incorporated town, and the oldest port in what was Washington Territory, cherishes its past.  It also provides a home away from home for a few residents who just can't seem to move on.  It is a spirited place, a ghost-friendly town.<br>
<br>
The residents of Steilacoom, who are wise enough to have pinned the town's future to its past, recognize the asset in their ethereal comrades.<br>
<br>
Just last week, historian and writer Jack Sage led two ghost tours of the town.  Three dozen people, armed with flashlights and the willies, followed him along Starling Street and Champion Street and Union Avenue, past the haunts of overly loyal residents, and, according to old religious beliefs, straight along the border where one reality joins another.<br>
<br>
Richard Overman, professor of religion at the University of Puget Sound, counts himself among those who do believe in the ghosts behind Sage's tales.<br>
<br>
Bates, who lived on the edge of poverty in the middle of the last century, and strolls along the. edge of reality in this century.<br>
<br>
Bates was neither intelligent nor prosperous, Sage said.<br>
<br>
"But he had a cow, and this cow was his pride and joy," Sage added.  "It was the only possession he really had.  And then it turned up missing one day."<br>
<br>
In those days, before the railroad sidetracked the town's dream of growing into a prosperous terminal city, Steilacoom was a booming place, its main street lined with saloons and hotels catering to the needs of laboring men.  Word traveled fast in the saloons, and anyone who needed information knew to go there for it, which is what Bates did.<br>
<br>
"One of the men said, 'I saw Andrew Byrd take your cow to the slaughterhouse,"' Sage related.<br>
     
Byrd was a prosperous miller, with a sawmill and a gristmill off of Chambers Creek, and a slaughterhouse not far away.  Byrd came to Steilacoom several times a week, and always stopped at the post office.<br>
<br>
That's where Bates found him.<br>
<br>
"Bates saw Andrew Byrd and said 'What did you do with my cow?' Andrew said 'You'll have to go elsewhere.  I don' know anything about it.' Bates was upset, and he got a gu and shot Byrd twice," Sage said.<br>
<br>
It took Byrd a day to die, and in that time, he spoke up for Bates.<br>
<br>
"Before he died, he said 'Don't do anything to that man.  He's a little retarded.' They put Bates in the jail on Starling Street, and that night between 100 and 150 of the town's citizens decided to do something about it," Sage said.  "They broke into the jail and locked up the sheriff.  They took Bates out and found a barn and hanged him.  The man who told him the false information got scared and left for Oregon."<br>
<br>
Bates, however, remained.<br>
<br>
"The story is that on moonlit nights you will still see Bates going around the streets with a hangman's noose around his neck, trailing a rope and looking for his cow.  He may be up by the jail or down by the saloons or up by Steilacoom Lake," Sage said.<br>
<br>
But the moon is always out.<br>
<br>
It could be the moon that lifts the fog between his world and this one, according to Overman's theory and beliefs.. held by religions around the globe. European pagans and the Christians who converted them find common ground in their explanation of visits from the netherworld.<br>
<br>
"There is a time when time and space crack open and the connection between this world and the next world is easier to pass through.  A veil lifts, and you can go through.  A door opens, and there is passage back and forth," Overman said.  He noted that the Old Testament tale of Jacob's Ladder, which angels used to climb from heaven to earth, offers up the same image.<br>
<br>
Overman tells of the night he believes his grandmother made the passage.  He had been asleep, but he awoke to find her standing by
his bed.<br>
<br>
"She had a number for me, a seven-digit number. 1,518,321.  What it means, I don't know.  Is this the number of angels that can dance on the head of a pin?"' asked the scholar of religion.<br>
<br>
If his grandmother's visit was just a dream, he said, it was far more than any he experienced before or since - so dazzling that he got out of- bed and wrote the number down.<br>
<br>
'She was kindly and much as I remember her, except that, when she was alive, she was never very much interested in numbers.<br>
<br>
"If Grandmother Overman was a ghost, she made one of the most common types of visits across the way @ an appearance to a loved one, with a piece of advice or reassuring information.<br>
<br>
One of the commonest themes is that someone dies or is killed and immediately thereafter appears to someone in the family.  Usually the people are entirely skeptical, imd think what is going on here?' The message conveyed more often than not is, 'Don't worry, I'm all right,"' Overman said.<br>
<br>
These gentle visits, he said, are the stories that constantly increase the ranks of those who believe in ghosts.<br>
<br>
"You only have to see one white crow to know that they are not all black," he said.  "Even in this ordinary world of time and space, the transmission medium is much more mysterious than we would like to think."<br>
<br>
The patterns of these experiencest he noted, reflects the larger pattern of the order of heaven and earth outlined by many major religions.  Mortals pray to saints or ancestors in the belief that they can intercede for the living.<br>
<br>
Which is not to say that an the souls left behind are kindly, or even complete, Overman said.<br>
<br>
"In religious stories about the afterlife the same process is always dekribed.  At the moment of death, even though you may be faithfully religious, you end your earthly life plastered over with impurities.  These must be stripped away in the process of your ascent toward heaven.  It is like the process of ascent of a
NASA space rocket.  The part that will arrive is a teeny little part.  The rest is excess baggage that has to be blown awa A lot of that stuff which is blown back becomes space junk which is now dangerous.<br>
<br>
"In the ascent of the human soul toward heaven or the creator, there is a lot that's stripped away that behaves like space junk," Overman said.  "When you have ghosts that come back and cause problems generation after generation, I think that it's the leftover bits and pieces of some souL the rest of which may be elsewhere."<br>
<br>
That may be what one woman encountered, and later told Sage about<br>
She lives in a relatively new house built over the spot where a much older house once stood.<br>
<br>
"At night a light upstairs would go on for no reason, and they " Sage said. would hear footsteps,<br>
<br>
"They would go upstairs to investigate and find nothing."<br>
<br>
The lights would flash on when they were not at home, and the footsteps would tread on the fears of those who thought they were alone in the house.  In time, Sage said, ft all got to be too much for the woman.<br>
<br>
"She heard the footsteps and went to the stairs and shouted 'Go away.  I don't want you anymore.  You're scaring me.' After that, it didn't happen any more," Sage said, recounting a story told to him after the ghost tour.<br>
<br>
Overman theorized that the bit of afterlife junk needed that extra push to be sent out of this realm.  Facing down a ghost often works.<br>
<br>
But not always.<br>
<br>
"It can happen that a lot of stuff can congeal into a malicious form with all the bad parts of a person, and you get a bad ghost hanging around he said.<br>
<br>
That doesn't mean that the person was nasty - just that the good parts went on.<br>
<br>
"A fragment of a personality can still be able to cause physical effects.  The character can vary all the way from a concentrated bag of evil to something with the maliciousness of a 3-year-old child," Overman said.<br>
<br>
Some can be disposed of as easily as telling the footsteps to scram.  Others fight back.<br>
<br>
Overman is convinced that ghosts can do great damage.  Europe is full of legends that back him up.<br>
<br>
Sage said he's Heard of ghosts with the ability to chill - like old E.R. Rogers, who is regularly seen rocking in a chair looking out the north window of the mansion he built.<br>
<br>
People who have tried live in the house he built - then lost along with his fortune - say it is Rogers who keeps the chair by the window - even if they move the chair into a closet.  They say he doesn't want them there, and that, frankly, he's lousy company.<br>
<br>
And Sage has heard of ghosts who seem linked to territory<br>
more than buildings - visitors to his house have reported seeing a woman and a dog that shouldn't be in the residence built in 1963.<br>
<br>
He <B>thinks</B> she's a memory of the time the site was occupied by bootleggers.<br>
<br>
But he hasn't heard of any evil ghosts at work in Steilacoom.  Even in the old days, when the saloons and hotels went bust and decayed along the track and every kid in town knew they were haunted, no one felt threatened, Sage said.  They just let the spirits be.<br>
<br>
"Ghosts like vacant buildings," Sage explained.  "They don't bother people as much as people bother them."<br>

E.R.ROGERS GHOST<br>
<br>
Kathleen Merryman, "The spirit of Steilacoom," <B>The Tacoma News Tribune.</B> October 31, 1991.<br>
<br>
In the days of oil lamps and cotton lisle stockings, two images burned themselves into the wood-frame mansion at 1702 Commercial St. in Steilacoom.<br>
<br>
On the slanted attic ceiling above the spot where an oil lamp once stood, blackened wood smudges upward in a reversed image of the light the flame once threw.<br>
<br>
Nearby, a woman's stockinged foot occasionan treads.<br>
<br>
But there is no floor beneath the woman's foot. It was torn out a decade ago, when the house was transformed from Victorian derelict to upscale restaurant.<br>
<br>
If she is there, if witnesses saw the turning doorknob, the vanishing shape they thought they saw, if they felt a chill based more in temperature than fear, then that woman walks on the thinnest of air, the least substantial plane of reality.<br>
If she is there, then the building that houses E.R. Rogers Restaurant is haunted.<br>
<br>
Gordon Robertson, co-owner, believes she is there.  He is relieved that she seems to concentrate more on the staff than the patrons.<br>
The staff can see the economic wisdom in that, but somehow it doesn't make them feel much better late at night when doors swing open and lights go flashing on and candles get snuffed out, or when the smell of cheap perfume suddenly fills an empty room.<br>
<br>
"I do believe there are spirits here," Robertson said.  "But not all the spirits are like the movies.  It's not all that glamorous."<br>
<br>
Glamorous, no.<br>
<br>
Darn spooky, you betcha.<br>
<br>
Take the case of the exception to the rule, the bar patron-just over from England.  He was sitting with friends, chatting and not drinking too much, when his face went pale.  He dropped out of the conversation.  His friend, Jennifer Laughlin, thought she had said something to offend.  After they had left, she asked if she should apologize.<br>

No, said he.  She'd said nothing untoward.  It was the sight of a woman's stockinged foot stepping through the air into the attic that had quieted him.<br>
<br>
Laughlin who worked as a hostess at the restaurant believed him.<br>
<br>
She wondered if the woman wore the same perfume - cheap and heady that had enveloped her one night when she had been sent alone to the attic to fetch extra chairs.  There was no one there and there was someone there said Laughlin, who, like many other staffers at the restaurant, made it a personal policy not to go to the attic alone.<br>
<br>
By nature, the attic - a clutter of chairs and supplies and old pictures and oddly small rooms - is spookier than, say, the bar.<br>
<br>
By supernature, the bar holds its own.<br>
<br>
Lights, televisions, blenders, sound systems all flip on and off, switchin channels and gears when no one's there.  It's almost routine, Robertson said.  The bartenders have learned to take a lot in stride.<br>
<br>
Apparent breaches of the security system are not on that list<br>
Robertson remembered the night the bartender locked up and was headed for car when he saw lights going on and someone moving around in the restaurant.  He called the sheriffs department and waited for a deputy with a K-9 dog.<br>
<br>
The dog went in first, found nothing on the first two floors and came back for the deputy.  The deputy commanded the dog to check the attic.  The dog refused.<br>
<br>
"He said he'd never seen the dog do that before," Robertson said.  "The dog had never refused to go anywhere before."<br>
<br>
No one forced the dog to go up.  The humans finished the search - and found no one.<br>
<br>
At least one cleaning crew from Seattle sided with the dog.<br>
Robertson had hired them to come in at night, clean the carpets and be done by morning.<br>
<br>
They came, cleaned one room and cleared out.  When Robertson called to ask why, they said there would be no bill for the work they'd done, but they weren't coming back. The place was<br>
haunted they said. They didn't want to talk about it. Robertson now gets the carpets cleaned by day.<br>
<br>

He's  tried  to  figure  out who's  stayed   behind   since   the   house was built by seaman and merchant E.R.   Rogers,in   1891.<br>
<br>
Rogers, wife, Catherine, and his grown stepdaughter,   Kate,    lived there only until 1893, when they    lost  the  house  and all their money in a financial crash.<br>
<br>
He   wonders if Kate has come back   to   the   house   she   felt  she deserved.<br>
<br>
He  wonders  if  the   legend of Native American who was    hanged  in the  honey  locust   on   the   southwest corner  of  the  yard  has  anything.   to do  with  the  image  of  a  face  people<br>
see in the  illuminated  tree  at  night.<br>
<br>
He  wonders  if   one   of   the many boarders   who   stayed   at  the   home never   checked   out,   or   if   Hattie Bair is still fussing  about,  trying  to make everything nice for her<br>
guests.<br>
<br>
After  E.R.  Rogers   and   his   family lost  the  house  and   moved   back   to their   old   home   next    door,    the<br>
Charles   Herman   family    bought    it and   parlayed   its   17    rooms    and South   Sound   view   into    a    guest<br>
house  catering  to  city  folks  in  the summers.   Hattie    Bair,    who    with W.L.  Bair  ran  the   drug   store   and<br>
post office across the street bought the place in 1921  and  ran  it as  a  boarding   house   through   World War 11.<br>
<br>
Hattie  Bair  was  not  the kind   of woman to make a guest uncomfortable in her home, said her granddaughter, Jane Light, who still lives in Steilacoom.<br>
<br>
"Every tramp who came off the railroad had a place to stay and something to eat, usually in <B>exchange</B> for services such as chopping wood or cutting grass," Light said.  "She was a fantastic cook.<br>
<br>
"She loved people - the more people, the merrier.  She certainly would go up and touch them in a warm and friendly way.  She would not be the least bit intimidating, nor would she be sneaky.  She was not an intimidating person.<br>
<br>
That,   of   course,   was   when   she was a person.<br>
<br>
Mrs.   Bair    died    decades    ago, though there are some who wonder if part of her decided not to go.<br>
<br>
Light is not one of them.<br>
<br>
She has heard the stories about the big old house, and about the Bair Drug & Hardware Co. less than a block away.  They are nice stories, Light said, but that's as far as it goes.  She does not
think her late relatives just can't tear themselves away from Steilacoom.<br>
<br>
W.L. Bair opened Bair Drug in 1895, coaxed it into a post office and trolley stop and bequeathed it to his daughter and her husband, Eudocia and Wflfiam Leach.<br>
<br>
Like any aging store, it fell into disrepair.  Unlike most stores, it was resurrected by the Steilacoom Historical Museum Association and preserved as a combination museum, restaurant and unofficial command central for Steilacoom.<br>
<br>
When she took over the business, Rosa Kreger thought she was having trouble with her appliances.<br>
<br>
She thought the old stove was conking out and that the new one needed breaking in.  She thought the dishwasher yearned for a service call, and that the hand mixer needed a spot to stay put.<br>
Cinnamon buns and pies put into the oven at 350 degrees would trigger the smoke alirm after 20 minutes.  No wonder - the thermostat would be jacked up to 500 degrees.<br>
<br>
The brand new dishwasher invented new ways to break down - insulated wires frayed from the inside out, for instance<br>
The hand mixer hitch-hiked its way through the restaurant, turning up in spots where no one remembered putting it.<br>
<br>
And the $3 bottles of gourmet sahnon sauce tried to fly.<br>
A series of electricians, repairmen and gas company representatives have told Kreger there's nothing amiss with the machines.  The patron who watched the sauce make a 5-foot lateral<br>
leap from the top rear shelf of a display to the plank flooring stared at the shattered glass and said simply "That bottle didn't fall."<br>
<br>
"That salmon sauce flew off.  It flew," said the waitress who watched it happen.<br>
<br>
That was three weeks ago.  Since then, attempts to make the salmon sauce repeat its Evel Knievel impersonation on command have failed, but two more bottles have hit the floor without witnesses.<br>
<br>
Kreger and her partner, Mchael Mason, and the rest of the staff have resigned themselves to having one too many cooks.<br>
<br>
"We keep calling it Cub Bair," said Kreger, calling the store's founder, W.L. Bair, by his nickname.  "He worked here the longest, and is very finicky about changes.  He doesn't like all the
changes we are making."<br>
<br>
If it is the former merchant and postmaster, then he doesn't know how lucky he is.  The building is owned by the Steilacoom Historical Museum Association, which must approve any change in its appearance.  Its display cases are filled with antique remedies, candies and notions.  Its soda fountain still fizzes up an authentic Green River.<br>
<br>
Even so, new stoves, electric mixers, dishwashers and trendy sauces seem to irritate the heck out of someone.<br>
<br>
"It's nothing bad.  It just doesn't like the new stuff.  Any type of new machine, it just goes wild," said Michael Mason, who works with Rosa Kreger.<br>
<br>
It's a nice place for coffee in the morning, a pleasant place to meet friends in the afternoon.<br>
<br>
But deep into the night, it belongs to history - or the people<br>
who made history.<br>

<br>
Jack Sage of Steilacoom said he's Heard of ghosts with the ability to chill - like old E.R. Rogers, who is regularly seen rocking in a chair looking out the north window of the mansion he built.<br>
<br>
People who have tried live in the house he built - then lost along with his fortune - say it is Rogers who keeps the chair by the window - even if they move the chair into a closet.  They say he doesn't want them there, and that, frankly, he's lousy company.<br>

<br>
<B>"THE STRANGE STORY OF ALBERT BALCH," <B>Steilacoom Historical Museum Quarterly,</B> XI (Spring, 1982) p. 9.<br>
<br>
</B><br>
(Editors' Note: Early days of Steilacoom are recorded in the book Reminiscences of Washington Territory by Charles Prosch, Editor of the Puget Sound Herald, 1858-1864.  One of the most unusual accounts is the following concerning Albert Balch, brother of Lafayette Balch, founder of Steilacoom.  Albert was named on the jury that tried Leschi of the Nisquallies for murder.  The house at 1614 Rainier now owned by the Sherman Ingels was built by Lafayette for Albert in the late 1850's.)<br>
<br>
"A not uncommon and dangerous kind of insanity is that which appears at intervals, or which is not incessant.  It is dangerous because few know when to look for it, and are consequently apt to be taken by surprise in an unguarded moment.  A memorable case was that of Albert Balch, a storekeeper in Steilacoom many years ago.  His was a clear case of lunacy; at a certain stage of the moon he always became insane at other times he betrayed no sign of a disordered mind.<br>
<br>
As the months passed by his distemper increased, until it was deemed expedient to place him in an insane asylum.  The next time his lunacy appeared, the moon being at the stage which affected his brain, he was taken on board a lumber vessel by a keeper, who was instructed to convey him to the insane asylum at Stockton.  We had no asylum for the insane here then.<br>
<br>
A week before the vessel arrived at San Francisco, the moon having declined in the meantime, Balch became perfectly rational, and an examination by physicians resulted in finding his mental faculties in a healthy condition.  There being no alternative but to return to his home in Steilacoom, he did so in time to become again a lunatic, the moon in the interval having once more got to the stage which turned his brain.<br>
<br>
During a rational spell, about this period, he went to San Francisco to purchase a fresh stock of goods.  The night after his arrival there, while the moon was brightly shining, a policeman found him aimlessly wandering about the streets with a valise containing $2,500 in gold.  He could give no intelligible account of himself, but a brother found and cared for him until the moon lost its baleful influence, when he purchased the goods he required and returned to his home.<br>
<br>
One morning he was found dead in the woods near town, after having wandered by the light of the moon for hours through the timber with an axe in his hand.  He was in his night shirt, and had apparently killed himself by running, as his person contained no wound."

<br>

<br>
The Puget Sound Herald edition of 1 Jan 1863, p. 2, is enlightening:<br>
<br>
"DEATH OF ALBERT G. BALCH.  Our citizens were somewhat startled, on Sunday moming last, by the announcement that the body of Albert G. Balch had been found on the road leading from upper Stcilacoom to Olympia; the vital spark having fled some hours previous to the discovery.<br>
<br>
The deceased had been for five or six years subject to periods of insanity; the symstoms [sic] always exhibiting themselves with the appearance of the new moon, and increasing in strength for ten or twelve days, when they would suddenly disappear and leave him perfectly rational.<br>
<br>
On the occasion of his last affliction with this malady, he betrayed fears of enemies pursuing him to take his life or inflict personal injury; and it was no doubt under this state of feeling that on Saturday night when our dwellings were shaken by the violence of the wind, in alarm he left his bed and ran the fearful race that terminated his life.  From the position in which the body was found, it would seem that he had tripped upon a tree lying across the road, and struck the side of his face against a rock by the roadside.<br>
<br>
In his haste to fly from his fancied pursuers, he left his clothing behind, and was found nearly naked.  An inquest was held upon the body on Sunday, and the remains were interred on Tuesday, near Gravelly Lake.  The verdict of the Coroner's Jury is as follows:<br>
<br>
We the undersigned, having been summoned and acted as jurors, having been first duly swom, according to law, and having seen the body, do find that the body before us is that of Albert G. Balch, a native of the State of Maine, and a resident of this Territory for the past twelve years, is about 37 years of age, and by profession a merchant.<br>
<br>
We further find that the said Albert G. Balch came to his death on the night of Saturday, Dec. 27, 1862, by leaving his private dwelling, while in a state of insanity, and running from thence (in our opinion) through the woods to Col.  Wallace's claim, where he, being exhausted by running and exposure, fell dead,
across the road leading from upper Steilacoom to Olympia, where we found the body.<br>
<br>
Signed by Daniel Collins, Coroner, and Messrs.  W. R. Downey, M. J. West, Jesse Dunlap, Jas.  Hughes, P.           S.     Washburn, and Henry E. Bradley, Jurors.<br>
<br>
Several ineffectual attempts were made to get the deceased into the Stockton Lunatic Asylum; the nature of his insanity was such as to defeat these efforts.  On each occasion, before reaching San Francisco, the period of his insanity expired, and he was too rational to obtain admission.<br>
<br>
About three years ago, however, he went to San Francisco to purchase a stock of goods, and on his arrival there was overtaken by his unfortunate malady, and, while under its influence, was taken in charge late one night by a policeman, who found him wandering about the streets with a valise containing $2,200.  He should have been placed in the Asylum at this time, but his brother (Lafayette Balch) decided otherwise.<br>
<br>
About a year ago he was taken East by a nephew, with the view of leaving him among his relatives; but he soon succeeded in satisfying them of his insanity, got mained, and subsequently returned diseased in body as well as mind.  Exposure and privation on the return passage produced a severe cold, which settled on his lungs.  If his connections had detained him at home for a year or two, he might possibly have recovered his mental faculties, and survived many years, a useful member of society, happy himself and a source of happiness to others.<br>
<br>
As it was, there were few here to lament his death, for he was an annoyance and a terror to many of our citizens; nevertheless all regretted the manner in which it occurred."]<br>

<br>
Nineteen was a year of violence and unrest in many sectors of American society. A series of bloody race riots, several bitter labor clashes and a rising incidence of vigilante justice give this year a special significance in relation to the period of which it was a part. It was no accident that John Dos Passos chose 1919 as the title of the middle volume of his trilogy on American Society in crisis.<br>
<br>
One example of such violence was the encounter between members of the Industrial Workers of the World and the American Legion on the streets of Centralia, Washington, on November 11, 1919. The Centralia affair provides a useful illustration of the way in which local and regional conflicts often become entangled with and indeed contribute to tensions that shape opinions and attitudes on the wider national level.<br>
<br>
This episode can be studied with profit not only as a final violent chapter in the history of the IWW in the Pacific Northwest, but also as an example, along with the Sacco-Vanzetti case and the Wall Street bombing of the so-called Red Scare of the post  World War One years.<br>
<br>
The local and regional setting of the Centralia dispute gave it much of its distinctive neofrontier flavor; but the rhetoric and passion, especially of the legionnaires and their supporters, were drawn from the nation wide crusade against radicalism. World War One, with its toll of American dead and unresolved problems had left a residue of brittle patriotism and disillusionment and incidents like the one in Centralia served to accelerate the tendency toward polarization of American opinion.<br>
<br>
This converging of local and national issues may be illustrated by the very stereotypes of the protagonists. The Wobbly represented at once the discontented logger of the Northwest woods and the draft dodging seditious Bolshevik. The parading legionnaire, on the other hand, fit easily the image of acquisitive and repressive lumber baron, one hundred per cent American, and triumphant veteran.<br>
<br>
The Centralia case, then, may provide fertile ground for the kind of microanalysis suggested and employed elsewhere.<br>
<br>
If, as David M. Potter has said, " a microcosm is just as cosmic as a macrocosm." this incident presents us with the raw materials for a kind of case study in the struggles of the radical wing of the labor movement, the operation of small town mob rule, and the recurrence of the Red scare phenomenon in American society. Whether "cosmic" or not, this most interesting and lively writing allows critical evaluation of conflicting and highly partisan testimony
based on widely divergent interests and view. But whatever the conceptual framework, it must account for this dualism of provincial and national concerns.<br>
<br>
The purpose of the present paper is not to attempt such an analysis or to render another verdict in the case, it is, rather, to comment very selectively on some of the significant materials which resulted from the incident. No attempt is made here to comment on the official sources, such as the voluminous court proceedings, available to the historian of the Centralia case.<br>
<br>
The writer intentionally has focused, instead, on some of those accounts which were designed to influence public opinion concerning the case.<br>
<br>
In the years immediately following 1919, secondary accounts of the Centralia controversy were almost entirely those of directly interested parties and they took the form of apologia for the principals in the case. because of their clearly intended purpose of self justification and persuasion, they are biased, emotional and often contradictory. This polemic purpose of most of the early accounts of the Centralia case contributed to a continued polarization of opinion regarding its meaning for American society.<br>
<br>
As Robert Tyler has said: "For many years historians and publicists viewed the bloody...riot...as the evidence of frightening tendencies in American Society, either as the aggression of a fanatical Bolshevik cadre or the attempted bullying of a bona fide Fascist squadron (Robert Tyler,"Violence at Centralia, 1919," <B>Pacific Northwest Quarterly,</B> XLV (1954) p. 116.).<br>
<br>
It would be a mistake, however, to dismiss these important sources too quickly because of their admitted point of view and purpose. It is this very quality which gives them their special appeal. Taken together, these writings provide a valuable opportunity to study the anatomy of conflict, explicit, urgent, distorted, and yet full of meaning for the student of this troubled period.<br>
<br>
The two most interesting and possibly also most significant documents resulting from the Centralia episode are the quasi official, authorized description of the event produced by the American Legion and by the Industrial Workers of the World (Ben Hur Lampman, <B>Centralia:Tragedy and Trial.</B> Tacoma, 1920 and Ralph Chaplin <B>The Centralia Conspiracy: The Truth about the Armistice Day Tragedy,</B> Chicago, 1924.).<br>
<br>
Ben Hur Lampman, special correspondent for the <B>Portland Oregonian</B> at the trial in Montesano, Washington, was retained by the Tacoma and the Centralia American Legion posts to write an account of the "red assassination." Lampman was best known for his homespun, sentimental poems and essays which appeared occasionally in the <B>New York Times</B>, <B>Saturday Evening Post</B>, and <B>Sunset Magazine,</B> as well as the pages of the Portland daily.<br>

Three books of his collected pieces have since appeared and all are quite devoid of any material of social or political significance. They are concerned only with the wonders of nature and earned for Lampman the designation by his editor as "the American Izaak Walton." It is hard to imagine a more unlikely candidate for the task of chronicling the Centralia disaster.<br>
<br>
The eighty page pamphlet produced by Lampman was dedicated to the memory of the four legionnaires "...stricken down unawares by the cowardly hand of anarchy." In a foreword by the national commander of the Legion in an introduction by George Leonard Wood, and throughout the entire account, radicalism, anarchy, lawlessness, and communism are juxtaposed with law and order, one hundred per cent Americanism, patriotism, and American First.<br>
<br>
From the sinister sketch on the front cover depicting a gun wielding, desperate looking figure poised in a hotel window, to the Legion's Americanism program printed in the final pages, the Lampman pamphlets presents its case without equivocation; the IWW was guilty of unprovoked and premeditated murder; they were spokesmen for an alien doctrine threatening the very fabric of American society; and they should have been hanged rather than jailed or freed.<br>
<br>
Ralph Chaplin, whose booklet has provided a basic source for most of the liberal commentators on the Centralia affair, wrote his account while hiding out in a Seattle skid road hotel. Chaplin was a descendant of 17th century Puritans; his father voted Republican and despised Eugene V. Debs. Despite this background, Chaplin had been converted to socialism, and radical unionism while he was still a sensitive adolescent.<br>
<br>
In his autobiography <B>Wobbly, the rough and tumble story of an American Radical.</B> published in 1948, Chaplin described the effects on his family of the social and economic crises of the 1880s and 1890s and their struggle for a livelihood in Illinois, Kansas, and Iowa. He characterized himself in the years that followed as a "rebel editor, writer of battle songs, and agitator, and as a friend and fellow worker, for half a century...of the old time migratory revolutionaries.<br>
<br>
As an old man, mellowed by the passing years and a changed labor scene, Chaplain could still recall the difficulties of his task in 1919, " I tried to be fair in my reporting of the Centralia trial. But having been so close to the picture of IWW persecution, I found it almost impossible to be objective."<br>
<br>
The Chaplin booklet began with the assumption that there was a conspiracy of the lumber interests to rid the Northwest of brave men of the woods, who were striving for economic justice through the advanced working class movement.  The Centralia loggers, according to Chaplin and the IWW were guilty, not of murder but only of defending themselves, and their union hall against a well organized attack by the legionnaires, who were doing the bidding of
the lumber barons.<br>
<br>
"There is no question that the whole affair was the outcome of a struggle, a class struggle, if you please, between the union loggers and the lumber interests; the former seeking to organize the workers in the woods and the latter fighting this movement with all the means at its disposal."<br>
<br>
Time will not permit a complete analysis of the positions taken by the loggers and the legionnaires in their literature. However, in attempting to capture something of the color and controversy which was generated by the case, it may be helpful to sample the contrasting descriptions of various facets of the episode.<br>
<br>
Aside from the fundamental difference over the motivation and responsibility for the shooting. Lampman and Chaplin, speaking respectively for the Legion and for the IWW reaching predictably contrasting conclusions regarding a variety of other significant parts of the story. Their treatment of the background and setting of the case, the parade and shooting, the lynching, and the trial, will illustrate the nature and qualities of the arguments presented.<br>
<br>
Ralph Chaplin, in the IWW account of the case devoted nearly half of his booklet to putting the fateful day and its aftermath in context. He described such background factors as the plight of organized labor in the lumber industry of the Pacific Northwest, the evils of wage slavery, the Everett massacre of 1916, the Seattle General Strike of 1917, and the development of a conspiracy against the IWW in Centralia.<br>
<br>
Chaplin's description of the town itself will illustrate his style and the mood he attempted to convey:<br>
<br>
"Centralia in appearance is a creditable small American city, the kind of city smug people show their friends with p ride from the rose scented tranquility of a super six in passage...Centralia is somewhat of a coquette but she is as sinister and cowardly as she is pretty.<br>
<br>
"There is a shudder lurking in eery corner and a nameless fear sucks the sweetness out of the breeze...<br>
<br>
"A red faced business man motors leisurely down the west street. He shouts a laughing greeting to a well dressed group at the curb who respond in kind. But the roughly dressed lumber workers drop their glances in passing one another...<br>
<br>
"Around Centralia are wooded hills; men have been beaten beneath these trees and lynched from them...The vistas through the trees seem enchanted rather than real, unbelievably green and of form and depth that remind one of painted settings for a Maeterlinck fable rather than matter-of-fact timber land." (Chaplin, p. 31-32).<br>

Chaplin concluded his detailed description of the developing conspiracy with a flourish:<br>
<br>
"The Commercial Club was seething with intrigue like the court of old France under Catherine de Medici; only this time it was industrial unionists instead of Huguenots who were being marked for a new night of St. Bartholomew. The heresy to be uprooted was industrial instead of religious protestantism; but the stake and the gibbet were awaiting the New Idea just as they had the old." (Chaplin, p. 51).<br>
<br>
An Armistice Day parade, arranged by a joint committee of the American Legion and the Chamber of Commerce and routed directly by the union hall confirmed labor's fears.<br>
<br>
The American Legion account gave little space to the setting and background of the case. Lampman described his pamphlet as a "...comprehensive review of the trial at Montesano, Washington." Accordingly he used the framework of the trial proceedings to present and interpret the Legion's case, with only a few pages of introduction.<br>
<br>
The Centralia "assassinations" were put in the context of Communist inspired radicalism and were coupled with the Seattle general strike as manifestations of a "...propaganda of falsehood and renewed intrigue--piling lie upon lie until Munchausen himself has been brought to envy and Judas and Arnold outshone as traitors." (Lampman.<B>Centralia</B> p. 12.).<br>
<br>
In describing the parade and its tragic conclusion, Chaplin followed the contention of the IWW defense that the legionnaires, in collusion with local business men, had planned the route and arrangement of the parade so that on its return to the city park, the Centralia contingent would be at the rear, in a position to duplicate the "scorpion sting" of the 1918 parade. (Chaplin p. 66).<br>
<br>
Chaplin, depending on testimony and other accounts friendly to the loggers reconstructed the crucial moments:<br>
<br>
"The Chehalis division had marched past the hall and the Centralia division was just in front of it when a sharp command was given. the latter stopped squarely in front of the hall but the former continued to mar. Lieutenant Cormier of the secret committee was riding between the two contingents on a bay horse.<br>
<br>
"Suddenly he placed his fingers to his mouth and gave a shrill whistle. Immediately there was a hoarse cry of 'Let's go-o-o! At 'em boys!....<br>
<br>
"At the words "let's go..." the paraders from both ends and the middle of the Centralia contingent broke ranks and started on the run for the union headquarters. A crowd of soldiers surged against the door. There was a crashing of glass and a splintering of wood as the door gave way. a few of the marauders had actually forced
their way into the hall.<br>
<br>
"Then there was a shot, three more shots...and a small volley. From Seminary hill also rifles began to crack." ( Chaplin, p. 67).<br>
<br>
Lampman'description of the shooting wrapped the prosecution's contention of unprovoked murder in the garb of postwar patriotism:<br>
<br>
"...while members of the American Legion laughed and jested, in parade line, the zestful autumn air suddenly was rife with whistling lead. Back from France and Siberia they were, those boys, with the fancy in their hears that peril was past....<br>
<br>
"The shots that broke the parade formation, that plunged spitefully through the throngs of women and children on the gala streets came from the haggard windows of the IWW hall, on Centralia's main thoroughfare, Tower Avenue, from the blistered old rooming houses that flanked the avenue, and from the distant vantage point of Seminary Hill. As each hidden rifle cracked it spoke the welcome of radicalism to men who had returned from peril overseas." (Lampman, p. 14).<br>
<br>
Lampman added a rather oblique defense of what was to follow that night:<br>
<br>
"...but Centralia, above the bodies of her sons, vowed vengeance. Are  you among the critical? Had you been in Centralia that day yours would have been the first among the voices lifted for retributive justice." (Lampman p. 14).<br>
<br>
Despite the dramatic quality of the terror on Tower Avenue and the uncertainty and ambiguity which surrounded it, the climax of the violent incident was yet to take place, the lynching of Wesley Everest late that same evening.  Everest, an IWW member had fled from the hall and was captured on the banks of the Skookumchuck River.  Before he was forcibly overcome, he had fatally wounded Dale Hubbard, nephew of F.B. Hubbard, a prominent lumberman and leader of the Citizens Protective League.<br>
<br>
Understandably, the American Legion account did not dwell on the details of the Everest lynching. Lampman's brief reference can be quoted in full:<br>
<br>
"Everest died that night. From among his fellow prisoners in the Centralia jail, when the lights of the city were turned out, unknown avengers took him forth to the outskirts of the town, and hanged him from the river bridge, sending a rifle bullet through his dangling body.<br>
<br>
"The lynching of Everest was an unlawful error. Not only did it afford additional propaganda for the radicals, but and in this was the greater harm, it removed from trial one of the ring leaders of the Centralia reds, against whom evidence was damningly complete and conclusive.
"In cartoon the lynched "wobbly" has bee depicted as an ex-service man executed by his buddies. He worm the uniform by compulsion, after nimble draft dodging, as the records attest, and died the violent death of one who preached and advocated violence. (Lampman, 14-15).<br>
<br>
Far from dismissing the lynching as an "...unlawful error..." Chaplin's account was painfully complete and prepared the way for preserving the name of Wesley Everest as a durable martyr in the cause of radical labor. Chaplin pointedly described Everest as "American, old Washington pioneer stock." In contrast to the persistent anti-alien theme of the Lampman treatment and the Legion's Americanist campaign, Chaplin also pointed  out that Everest had seen service overseas, and he included a picture of the logger that showed him in his uniform with a caption characterizing him as earnest, sincere, and quiet. (Chaplin p. 60).<br>
<br>
The point of view and polemic intent of Chaplin's account are apparent throughout. Constructing his story from the trial defense and from statements by sympathetic union members and towns people, Chaplin told of the pursuit and capture of Everest, his near lynching at the scene of his capture, and the nightmare that followed during the late evening hours.<br>
<br>
While the city was momentarily plunged into darkness, Everest was taken from jail and spirited away by men in three luxurious automobiles. The assailants were always referred to as "business men."  The guard at the jail offered up his charge without resistance. the defense assertion that the mayor of Centralia and the City electricians were responsible for turning off the city lights was repeated uncritically.<br>
<br>
Chaplin was the first to mention Everest's emasculation on the way to his lynching. Many of the later sympathetic writers also reported the incident, even though the Federal Council of Churches study in 1930 concluded that it could not be substantiated.<br>
<br>
The brutal lynching itself is best described in Chaplin's own words:<br>
<br>
"Wesley Everest was dragged out of the middle machine. A rope was attached to a girder with the other end tied in a noose around his neck. His almost lifeless body was hauled to the side of the bridge. THe headlights of two of the machines threw a white light over the horrible scene.<br>
<br>
"Just as the lynchers let go of their victim the fingers of the half dead logger clung convulsively to the planking of the bridge. A businessman stamped on them with a curse until the grip was broken. There was a swishing sound; then a sudden crunching jerk and the rope tied to the girder began to writhe and twist like a live thing. This lasted but a short time." (Chaplin p. 77-78).<br>
<br>
There was never an official inquest into Everest's death. An often
repeated account was that of Coroner David Livingstone with which he regaled the "...gentlemen of the Elks Club..."<br>
<br>
"Wesley Everest had broken out of jail, gone to the Chehalis  River bridge and jumped off with a rope around his neck.  Finding the rope too short he climbed back and fastened on a longer one; jumped off again, broke his neck and then shot himself full of holes."<br>
<br>
Chaplin reported that "...businessmen still chuckle over the joke in Centralia..." (Chaplin p. 79).<br>
<br>
Only brief reference can be made to the treatment by Lampman and  Chaplin of the trial at which the eleven surviving IWW members faced charges of murder. Both writers were in attendance at the trail, Lampman as a special correspondent for the <B>Portland Oregonian</B> and Chaplin with credentials from the labor press.<br>
<br>
The descriptions of leading personalities involved in the trial suggest the writers' treatment of more substantive issues. To Judge John M. Wilson, Lampman applies such qualities as "...remarkable forbearance and leniency," "firmness" and "exact justice."<br>
<br>
To Chaplin, however, the trial judge appeared as a "bird of prey" in his black robe, "perched above the courtroom," ruling "always adversely to the cause of labor."<br>
<br>
Prosecutors Herman Allen, W.H. Abel and C. D. Cunningham, were "suave," "dignified" "resourceful" men, "...excelling in argument..." and masters of the law, when described by Lampman, but as sounding the "gamut of rottenness" and as hirelings of the "...lumber interests..." when referred to by Chaplin. On the other hand Lampman described George F. Vanderveer, attorney for the accused Wobblies, as the high priest of the IWW who had been retained  by the national organization at a fee of fifty thousand dollars; he was "cynical, persuasive, tense, with a smile that turned at times to comradeship and again to a fighting sneer."<br>
<br>
But to Chaplin, Vandeveer was "...a man of wide experience and deep social vision" who singlehandedly "opposed six high priced lumber trust prosecutors. (Chaplin p. 91 and 125).<br>
<br>
Chaplin, especially, took full advantage of the dramatic element sin the courtroom scene. He commented on the logger in "stag shirt and overalls," and the women "neat and smug in appearance, busy with bits of sewing or crocheting." He described the pathetic picture of the young children in the court room; Warren Grimm's baby daughter "...who had to be restrained from playing with the tots across the way whose fathers were accused of having killed her papa," and Eugene Barnett's baby son who was "...sitting beside his mother...and casting childish looks of unspeakable affection at his boyish father on the prisoner's bench. (Chaplain p. 131).<br>
<br>
Years later, writing his autobiography, Chaplin remembered another reaction to the trial:
"Through the courtroom windows I watched the pointed tops of ragged fir trees in the rain, and I felt like crying out against the hatred and misunderstanding that pitted the fine young Americans, one against the other like wild beasts.<br>
<br>
"I was convinced of the justice of the IWW case, but the constant repetition of violence, bloodshed, and imprisonment was beginning to make me wonder. I had reached the stage where I was groping for a more rational type of labor relations. (Chaplin, Wobby, p300-
301).<br>
<br>
It seems likely as is often the case with such recollections many years after the fact, that these comments represent Chaplin's views reconstructed in 1948, rather than a modification of the position he held nearly thirty years before.<br>
<br>
Characteristically, the two booklets ended with divergent appeals. Chaplin called for the release of the men still buried alive in prison, and asked his readers: "What are you going to do?" Lampman raised a different question in his closing appeal against radicalism: "Have you a Wobblie in your town?  While calling for restraint of sentiment against the convicted as individuals, he asserted that the slavering beast known as the IWW should be shown no such mercy.<br>
<br>
"When Americans hear the plaza orator pour out his vitriol, as he does, the smile of tolerance should fade and never reappear. For the scored and ensanguined seeds he sows are the same dragon's teeth from which Centralia reaped her harvest of most lamentable death." (Lampman, p. 73).<br>
<br>
During the 1920s and early 1930s the Centralia case frequently found its way into print as liberals took up the cause of the prisoners and pressed for their release. The pages of <B>New Republic, Christian Century,</B> and <B>Current History,</B> among others, joined the official publications of the IWW General Defense Committee in appealing to the governor of Washington for commutation of the sentences.<br>
<br>
Dozens of affidavits were gathered from jurors, marchers, and towns people supporting IWW claims. Eugene Barnett, one of the convicted loggers, wrote a moving piece pleading his innocence but defending the role of radical labor. Upton Sinclair submitted correspondence to the <B>New Republic</B> to demonstrate that the governor was not considering the merits of the case, but merely disliked the political views of those who were making the appeals.<br>
<br>
The American Legion even produced its own gadfly in the somewhat quixotic person of Captain Edward Patrick Coll. A western Washington insurance man, legionnaire, and distant cousin of Eamon de Valera, Coll began to raise questions during the 1920s about the role of the Legion in the Centralia case.<br>
<br>
His investigations produced thirty affidavits supporting the
prisoners, leading him to believe that the marchers had been at fault. When his attempts to secure an official legion investigation failed, he sparked a careful study by cooperating Protestant, Catholic and Jewish social action groups.<br>
<br>
Their report, although highly critical of the Centralia business community and the conduct of the trial, was not received with much enthusiasm by the IWW. It was considered too moderate and as representing only a comfortable middle class liberalism attempted to salve its conscience. <B>Industrial Solidarity</B> dismissed the report as "merely evident of where church people and their ilk inevitably lined up in the class struggle.<br>
<br>
Historiographically, however, the Federal Council of Churches study does represent the first relatively systematic and unbiased attempt o arrive at an accurate assessment of the case. Later scholarly studies have in the main supported the conclusions of the report. In focusing on what it called the "passion of the community" which made sane moral judgments impossible, it went to the heart of the matter: "Both sides used social dynamite and neither seems to have realized the magnitude of its offense."<br>
<br>
Publication of this moderate report, however, hardly ended the partisan appeals, In 1931 Louis Adamic wrote his angry study called <B>Dynamite: The Story of Class Violence in America,</B> and the next year John Dos Passos' <B>1919</B> included an essay on the Centralis martyr. Both books, reflecting the dismal milieu of the early 1930s gave new life and relevance to the struggle a decade earlier between logger and lumberman in the Northwest woods.<br>
<br>
Although Wesley Everest became Paul Bunyan in the Dos Passos piece, the content and point of view were the same as those in the flaming pamphlet that Chaplin had written in the Seattle hotel. Indeed, Chaplin seems almost to have anticipated Dos Passos' Bunyan analogy in his comparison of the martyrdom of the Centralia lumberjack with that of the Nazareth carpenter: "A rebel unto Caesar, then as now, Alone, thorn crowned, a spear wound in his side."<br>
<br>
Despite the emotional content of these publications and their appeal to the Left, it was probably the degree of respectability and legitimacy given to the release appeals by the Federal council of Churches study, as well as a substantial change in public opinion in the Northwest that led to the release of all but two of the convicted men by the early 1930s.<br>
<br>
James McInerney was still imprisoned when he died on August 13, 1930. Only Ray Becker remained in prison during most of the decade; he was not released until September, 1939.  (Albert F. Gunns, "Ray Becker, the Last Centralia Prisoner," <B>Pacific Northwest Quarterly,</B> LIX(1968), p. 88-99.).<br>
<br>
With the raison detre of the crusade removed the Centralia case lost its appeal to the publicists, and the arena shifted to the more objective  but less pungent style of the scholarly journal, to
an illustrative role vis a vis the Red scare, in under graduate textbooks, and most recently to be come part of Melvin Dubofsky's major study of the IWW.<br>
<br>
The alarums and violence abroad in America during these troubled years have produced some valuable monographs. Perhaps the foregoing will suggest to the historian and to the social scientist the potentialities of the Centralia incident for further study.<br>
<br>
A convergence of highly charged local and national issues, involving elements of intergroup conflict, class consciousness, and community pressure gives Centralia in 1919 much of the same appeal which has continued to attract scholars to such incidents as the Sacco-Vanzetti and Haymarket cases.<br>
<br>
More than a generation ago, Captain Coll predicted that Centralia's memorial statue to its slain legionaries would someday assume the likeness of Wesley Everest. The statue in the city part remains unchanged today, but through the efforts of pamphleteer and scholar, the story of logger as well as legionnaire has been recorded for all to read.<br>

<br>
ARMISTICE DAY IN CENTRALIA<br>
<br>
Fred Thompson, <B>The IWW Its first fifty years.</B> Chicago: Industrial Workers of the World, 1955 p. 132-133.<br>
<br>
When the Armistice Day parade, November 11, 1919, stopped in front of the IWW hall in Centralia, Washington, there was no doubt what the intent was. Once before, on April 20, 1918, a parade had stooped at the IWW hall and demolished it, the banker taking the secretary's desk.<br>
<br>
In June of 1919 a Citizen's Protective League was talking of driving the IWW out of Centralia, and it was common talk that the Armistice Day parade would be used for this purpose. IWW lumber jacks consulted a local attorney, Elmer Smith, who told them they had a legal right to protect their hall by arms.<br>
<br>
On November 7, it was announced that the parade would march to Third and Turner and return, that is, march to the corner past the IWW Hall, turn and march past it again.  That left no doubts.  When the parade came, the post master and ex Mayor McCleary were each carrying a coil of rope conspicuously prepared for a lynching bee.<br>

Paraders after the turn of the line of the march broke out and when they broke through the door of the IWW hall, IWW members shot and killed three of the attackers. Then the mob surged in, beat and arrested the defendants, except one, Wesley Everest, a returned soldier, who went out the back of the hall, holding the mob at a distance with his automatic as he retreated toward the Chehalis River.<br>
<br>
There he offered to surrender to any officer of the law, but not to the mob. Dale Hubbard, son of the banker who had taken the IWW desk in the 1918 raid, stepped out to take him; Everest shot and killed. Then his revolver jammed and the mob had him. They beat him, rammed a rifle butt down his throat, and threw his bleeding body in the center of the jail where his fellow workers, locked in cells could see him but do nothing for him.<br>
<br>
That night the mayor and city electrician shut off all lights in the city and the businessmen opened the jail, took Everest out to  lynch him, cutting off his genitals before they did so.<br>
<br>
A reign of terror followed in the region. It was open season on Wobblies. When the defenders of the hall were brought to trail on a charge of conspiracy to murder, troopos surrounded the court house at Montesano (county seat of nearby Grays Harbor County).<br>
<br>
The evidence clearly established that the conspiracy was that of the businessmen to drive out the IWW with a threat of lynching and with the probability of an acutal lynching such as they did indisputably perpetrate, and that the first shot was fired after the invasion of the hall.<br>
<br>
A Seattle labor jury sent by the American Federation of Labor to witness the trial, judged the men completely innocent. The jurors found them guilty of the impossible charge of second degree murder on a conspiracy indictment. Later affidavits from the jurors declare that this verdict was wrung from them by intimidation, and fear what the business class could do to them in the community where they had their homes.<br>
<br>
Elmer Smith, the lawyer who advised them was acquitted and spent most of his time until his death in 1930 in efforts to obtain their release, but his efforts and the findings of church and other bodies left the governors unmoved; probably because to recognize the men's innocence was to recognize the guilt of the American Legion and the business men.<br>
<br>
Lumber Workers Industrial Union survived the terriorism and remained a sturdy organization until 1925 when it was rendered ineffective by dissension and the gyppo system.<br>

<B>BATTLE OF EVERETT<br>
<br>
</B><B><br>

</B>Gordon R. Newell, "Everett and the IWW," <B>Ships of the Inland Sea.</B> Portland: Binfords and Mort, 1951. p. 179-182.<br>
<br>
Everett is a Puget Sound city with a more turbulent history that most of her sister ports. There, in the Spring of 1916, violence flared into a bloody battle in which two members of the Mosquito Fleet were involved, winning a place in history at the cost of broken rails, bullet shattered windows and blood stained decks.<br>
<br>
The IWW movement had started in the Pacific Northwest in 1905. The then radical organization found enthusiastic followers among the loggers and migratory workers of the Puget Sound County. By 1910 its slogans, "Industrial Workers of the World," "Workers of the World Unite," and "One Big Union," had become familiar, stenciled on stumps and boulders or on skid row buildings.<br>
<br>
Known contemptuously as "Wobblies," the holders of red card were the object of fear and contempt on the part of the more "respectable" element. When they undertook to organize strikes, the forces of law and order began suppressing the movement with forthright brutality. The Wobblies countered with soap box speaking campaigns. The law of free speech was overlooked, but when speakers were hustled off to jail, new speakers took their places. Before long many Pacific Northwest cities had no more room in their jails and the soap boxes were still manned.<br>
<br>
When the IWW tried these tactics in Everett, the industrialists of that city resorted to more direct action. Instead of sending the Wobblies to jail, they loaded them into automobiles and took them out of town. There they were beaten with "devil's club" an ugly swamp shrub with long sharp spikes, or made to run the gauntlet of clubs and pick handles swung hard by husky vigilantes.<br>
<br>
The IWW took this punishment for five months and managed to organize a strike of Everett shingle weavers. Then the Wobblies organized an excursion which they described as a "free speech demonstration" but which the Everett Commercial Club called "...an armed invasion of the city."  That's where the Puget Sound steamers <B>Verona</B> and <B>Calista</B> came into the picture.<br>
<br>
On Sunday, November 5, over 300 Industrial Workers of the World left Seattle on the two steamers. The <B>Verona</B> had a capacity crowd of Wobblies aboard. The <B>Calista</B> followed with the balance of the demonstrators plus the regular Seattle to Everett passengers. According to which side of the story you listen to, they were either armed to the teeth or had only a couple of pistols among them; were either cold sober and well behaved or roaring drunk looking for trouble.
Everett had been notified of the steamers' sailing and Sheriff Don McRae was planning his defenses. He deployed his forces, well armed, along the dock and in the waterfront buildings.  Early in the afternoon, the white propeller steamer <B>Verona</B> was seen through the low lying mist of the outer harbor.  One of the many sawmill whistles cut loose in a long, hoarse roar that echoed and reverberated from the wet, brooding hills around the city.<br>
<br>
At the alarm, the law officers and vigilantes checked their rifle loads and thousands of Everett citizens made for hillside vantage points from which they watched the ensuing tragedy performed.<br>
<br>
Slowly the <B>Verona</B> steamed toward the dock, her decks black with Wobblies singing their favorite battle hymn "Hold the Fort." The decks were jammed. One young fellow had climbed to the top of the steamer's flag staff from which vantage point he waved his hat jauntily at the silent crowds ashore. Out in the harbor the smaller <B>Calista</B> was seen dimly through the mist as she drifted in the <B>Verona's</B> wake. As the <B>Verona</B> slid in toward the dock the sheriff raised his hand to silence the chanting Wobblies and shouted to the captain in the pilot house.<br>
<br>
"You can't lead here!"<br>
<br>
The captain's answer was drowned out by the great shout of defiance from the steamer. As the bow brushed the pier a man on the dock looped a line over a bollard.<br>
<br>
Then it happened.<br>
<br>
From somewhere a shot blasted out. Who fired it, whether it came from the ship or from the shore, has never been proven. That first, inevitable shot was followed by a moment of dead silence. Then seething, roaring hell broke out. For the next ten minutes Everett's waterfront saw violence never equalled before or since.<br>
<br>
Screaming men on the <B>Verona</B> crumpled to the deck as the volume of fire from the dock swelled to a crackling roll. Up in the pilot house, Captain Chance Wyman,  saw the first of some 175 led slugs tear into his sanctum. One of them took a wrist thick spoke from the hardwood steering wheel. Captain Wyman retired to the lee side of the ship's iron safe and remained there for the remainder of the battle.<br>
<br>
As bullets whined and thudded into the ship, the fire was returned.  Deputies ashore began to fall back wounded. Panic gripped the men on the <B>Verona</B>; the crowd stampeded for the off side of the steamer, out of range of the murderous fire from the dock.  The <B>Verona</B> heeled far over until it seemed that she must capsize. Then a section of the rail gave way and a dark cataract of struggling men poured into the misty water.<br>
<br>
Fire from the dock and from the American Tugboat Company's <B>Edison</B> whipped the water around the struggling men to red foam. Most of
them sank from sight.<br>
<br>
Slowly, as in a nightmare, the steamer righted somewhat as men moved into the cabin to fire from shattered windows and doorways. As slack came on the single blow line, it was cut. bullet riddle, with blood dribbling darkly down her white sides, the <B>Verona</B> backed slowly away from the dock with gunfire still crackling from both sides.<br>
<br>
Out in the harbor at last, her captain slowed to warn the <B>Calista</B> off. Then he raced for Seattle with his cargo of dead and wounded men. Back in  Everett, ambulances were clanging toward the dock. When the score was counted, it was found that two Everett deputies were dead. Sixteen, including Sheriff McRae, were wounded. The Wobblies had five dead, thirty-one wounded. Most of the men who went overboard were believed drowned, but in the excitement no one noticed what happened to them.  Few of them had friends or families to be concerned about them.<br>
<br>
The steamers were met at the dock in Seattle by a police riot squad which dragged the surviving IWWs off to jail. Seventy-five of them were held on murder charges which couldn't be made to stick, but the IWW lost prestige in the Battle of Everett.<br>
<br>
By the time the first World War was over the movement was almost finished.  Most of the labor reforms the Wobblies fought for, considered radical at the time, are accepted practices today. Police clubs haven't cracked workers heads for many years but labor violence was part of the new frontier's growing pains.<br>

The Centralia Massacre<br>
By Walter Evans<br>
<br>
Centralia, November 13, 1919-<br>
<br>
The state of Washington was in a state of near-hysteria today, two days after the shooting of four American Legionnaires by members of the Industrial Workers of the World and the lynching of an IWW man here.<br>
<br>
Although Gov. Louis Hart, who returned to Olympia from Spokane following the Armistice Day Massacre, has not called martial law, he did call for an all-out legal war on "treasonable and criminal elements."<br>
<br>
All across the state, bodies are being formed - primarily among
American Legion posts - to assist police in "eradicating the IWW and other Bolshevists organizations."  The police, state and local authorities are participating wholeheartedly in the campaign.<br>
<br>
And if Gov. Hart has not declared martial law, there is something very like it here in Centralia, where groups of ex-servicemen patrol the streets and armed guards are at every bridge and entrance to town.  If civil law has not been suspended, it has certainly taken a leave of absence.  This city's police affairs are under direction of a special committee of the American Legion.<br>
<br>
Already controversy is swirling around the few minutes just before 3 p.m. day-before-yesterday when gunfire marked a tragic end to Centralia's Armistice Day Parade.<br>
<br>
The Legion and the country authorities contend there was a plot by the IWW to "get the men prominent in anti-Red activities" here.  The IWW maintains it was simply defending its hall against an attack by the ex-servicemen.<br>
<br>
Certainly there has been a great deal of agitation for removal of the Wobblies from Centralia.  And in April of last year, during a Red Cross parade, a group of Centralians smashed the IWW hall and beat up several members.<br>
<br>
There were rumors again earlier this week that the Armistice Day parade would give a repeat performance.  The owner of the Roderick Hotel, in which the IWW hall is located, asked Police Chief  A. C. Hughes if the police would protect the property. The police chief replied:<br>
<br>
"We'll do the best we can for you, but as far as the Wobblies are concerned they wouldn't last 15 minutes if the businessmen don't want any Wobblies in this town."<br>
<br>
The IWW published a pamphlet November 4 to the citizens of Centralia, which read, in part, "To the citizens of Centralia, and to the working class in general: We beg of you to read and carefully consider the following:<br>
<br>
"The profiteering class of Centralia has of late been waving the flag of our country in an endeavor to incite the lawless element of our city to raid our hall and club us out of town.  For this purpose they have inspired editorials in the Hub, falsely and viciously attacking the IWW, hoping to gain public approval for such revolting criminality.<br>
<br>
"These profiteers are holding numerous secret meetings to that end and covertly inviting returned servicemen to do their bidding.  In this work they are ably assisted by the bankrupt lumber barons of Southwest Washington who led the mob that looted and burned the IWW hall a year ago."<br>
<br>
The pamphlet outlined the false charges of subversion the IWW said
was laid against it and told of the sufferings of its members for "no crime save that of loyalty to the working class" and ended with:<br>
<br>
"Many IWW in and around Centralia went to France and fought and bled for the democracy they never secured.  They came home to be threatened with mob violence by the law and order outfit that pilfered every nickel possible from their mothers and fathers while they were fighting in the trenches in the thickest of the fray.<br>
<br>
"Our only crime is solidarity, loyalty to the working class and justice to the oppressed."<br>
<br>
The IWW asked attorney Elmer Smith if they could defend their hall from invasion and Smith informed them they could.  The IWW, however, went a step further and instead of arming men in their hall alone, set up a field of fire around it.<br>
<br>
Wesley Everest, who was lynched by the mob following the shooting; Britt Smith, the IWW secretary; Ray Becker; Bert Faulkner; Mike Sheehan and James McInerney were in the IWW hall on Tower Avenue.  O. C. Bland and John Lamb were in the Arnold Rooming House across the street; Loren Roberts, Bert Bland and Ole Hanson were a quarter-mile away on Seminary Hill, a ridge east of Tower Avenue.<br>
<br>
Supposedly a man named Davis and Eugene Barnett were in the Avalon Hotel also across Tower Avenue from the IWW hall.<br>
<br>
The men were armed with a variety of weapons ranging from a Colt .45 to a high-powered Savage rifle.<br>
<br>
They were in place Tuesday when the parade came marching up Tower Avenge from the city park, led by the Centralia veterans, then the Chehalis Legionnaires (there were 520 veterans in uniform in the parade), Boy Scouts, women who had taken an active part in war work and the Elks Club and its band.<br>
<br>
The parade proceeded north on Tower Avenue to Third Street, past the IWW hall located between Second and Third Streets.  At Third Street it reversed the order and marched south on Tower.<br>
<br>
Everybody, including one platoon of Centralia veterans, had passed the IWW hall when the group of Centralia veterans started marking time to close up ranks.<br>
<br>
Exactly what happened then may never be known exactly.  Either the veterans started charging the IWW hall and were met with a volley of gunfire or there was a volley of gunfire and the veterans then charged the hall.<br>
     
Evidence given in a coroner's jury earlier today tend to support the former version, although the Legionnaires are now denying that they had any intentions of doing the IWW harm.<br>
<br>
Dr. Frank Bickford, a Legionnaire who was in the line of march, said at the inquest that the door of the IWW hall was forced open by the ex-servicemen before the shooting started.<br>
<br>
Dr. Bickford said while the men were marking time in front of the IWW hall, someone suggested it be raided.<br>
<br>
"I spoke up and said I would lead if enough would follow," Dr. Bickford told the coroner's jury, "but before I could take the lead there were too many ahead of me.  Someone next to me put his foot against the door and forced it open after which a shower of bullets poured through the opening about us."<br>
<br>
Another witness, Dr. Herbert Beli, said the men broke ranks and charged the hall simultaneously with the outbreak of shots.<br>
<br>
Arthur McElfresh, 26, manager of a pharmacy here, was the first to fall in front of the IWW hall.  Dr. Bickford crawled to him and loosened his collar, then attempted to get him to a hospital.  He died before the hospital was reached.<br>
<br>
Ben Casagranda, 25, a bootblack and a veteran of the fighting in France, doubled over, clutching his stomach.  He was fatally injured.<br>
<br>
Warren O. Grimm, 30, Centralia attorney and former University of Washington football star, was struck by a bullet.  He reeled and William Scales, who was standing beside him asked if he was badly hit.<br>
<br>
"I don't think so," Grimm, who had been commander of the Grant Hodge Post of the American Legion here for just one week, said and started toward an auto.  The wound, however, proved fatal.<br>
<br>
Four persons were wounded in that brief, but bloody, battle at 2:55 p.m.  Emery Coleman, Eugene Pfitzer and H. W. Eubanks suffered minor wounds and John Earl Watt was seriously injured.  His condition was reported better today.<br>
<br>
All of the people injured by gunfire were in the line of march, which lends further credence to the Wobbly claim that they fired
only into those charging the hall.  No spectators were injured, although two women reported that ricocheting slugs passed through their skirts.<br>
<br>
All of the Wobblies except the man named Davis and Ole Hanson were captured after the incident and there have been rumors that perhaps one of them fell victim to the lynch mob, also.  It is possible, however, that they made their way clear of the area in the first few minutes of confusion.<br>
<br>
Although most of the men in the IWW hall surrendered without a fight after the first scuffle, Wesley Everest, and Army veteran and IWW organizer, attempted to escape through a back door.  He led a group of pursuers on a chase of 1 1/2 miles through the streets of the city, firing as he ran and reloading when his gun was out of ammunition.<br>
<br>
He was stopped by the Skookumchuck River.  He attempted to wade it, then apparently changed his mind - or, perhaps he could not swim and the river was high - and came back to the bank:<br>
<br>
"Come on and take me, you ..." he said.<br>
<br>
Hubbard, who was in front of the pursuers came on and was within 10 feet of Everest when two bullets dropped him.  Everest emptied his gum into Hubbard then was overwhelmed by the group chasing him.  The mob beat him severely before dragging him back to jail.<br>
<br>
Near the jail someone threw a rope around Everest's neck.  The IWW organizer defied them to hang him.<br>
<br>
"What's your name?" someone in the crowd asked.<br>
<br>
Another man in custody, being taken into jail, shouted, "Tell 'em it's none of their damned business, Red."<br>
<br>
Everest answered "Brick Smith," and a murmur went through the crowd that Britt Smith, the IWW secretary had been caught.  A rope was thrown over the cross-support of a telephone pole and Everest said:<br>
<br>
"Hang me - go ahead and hang me."  There are reports he also told the mob they didn't "have the guts " to hang him in the daytime.<br>
<br>
He was taken to the jail and thrown into a corridor, where he lay, bleeding and moaning.<br>
<br>
The mob continued to grow around the jail when, at 7 p.m., the lights of the city went out.  It was no accident.  The only engineer on duty on duty at the city's light plant was due several blocks away at 7 p.m. to throw a switch that furnishes several
sections of the city.  While he was gone, someone pulled out a connection switch that feeds electricity to the entire city.<br>
<br>
By the time the engineer stumbled back to the plant in the dark, found the trouble and connected the circuits, the purpose of the blackout had been served.<br>
<br>
After the lights went out, two cars swung onto Tower Avenue with headlights blazing.  The crowd shouted for the drivers to extinguish the lights, but before the they could comply, they were smashed out by the mob.<br>
<br>
While that was going of a third auto came from the opposite direction and parked in front of the jail.  Several men got out and entered the jail.  They smashed through a wooden door to the jail office, opened the door of steel bars and took Everest from the corridor where he lay.<br>
<br>
Jailer Robert Jackson said he was in the rear of the jail with a special deputy when the mob broke in and the "corridor filled with men."  He said the barred door between the office and the corridor had been left unlocked.<br>
<br>
Everest was taken to a bridge over the Chehalis River - on the ride there he was castrated by one of the lynch mob - a rope was placed around his neck and he was dropped over the edge of the bridge.  While he was hanging there his body was riddled with bullets.<br>
<br>
Sometime early yesterday morning it was cut down and floated in the river for several hours before being recovered at 2 p.m.  It was taken to the jail after both undertakers in town refused to handle it.<br>
<br>
Finally, today, four of the IWWs among the 42 under arrest here, guarded by armed soldiers, took the body to the local cemetery and buried it in an unmarked grave.<br>
<br>
Until today it was thought that the lynched man was Britt Smith.<br>
<br>
While Everest was being lynched the men still held in jail were going through a night of terror.<br>
<br>
"I have heard tales of cruelty," James McInerney said, "but I believe what we boys went through can never be equalled.  I thought it was my last night on earth and had reconciled myself to an early death of some kind, perhaps hanging.<br>
<br>
"I was taken out by the mob once and a rope was placed around my neck and thrown over a cross-bar or something.  I waited for them to pull the rope, but they didn't.  I heard voices say, 'That's not him,' and they put me back in jail."
Britt Smith said, "Every time I heard a footstep or the clanking of keys, I thought the mob was coming after more of us.  I didn't sleep - couldn't sleep.  All I could do was strain my ears for the mob I felt sure was coming."<br>
<br>
Ray Becker, said, simply: "It was one hell of a night."<br>
<br>
The light of day yesterday didn't slacken the tensions, but there has been no more violence in the city.  Instead, a hatred for the IWW seems to be spreading throughout the state, a hatred that could spell the death knell of the organization as a force in the timber industry here.<br>
<br>
Certainly there will be a series of official moves to eradicate the IWW.  Although Gov. Hart would not call a special session of the Legislature, saying there were laws already to "wipe out sedition and prevent seditious organizations," he urged state officials to "renew our allegiance to the Constitution and the law and go forward with a determination speedily and lawfully to rid this state of these enemies of society and of constitutional government."<br>
<br>
United States Attorney Robert Saunders was even more outspoken.  He told police organizations in the state to "arrest every IWW whether he has a card or is known to be affiliated with that organization."  Saunders said he would charge them with attempting to overthrow the government.<br>
<br>
The Seattle police began a "campaign of extermination" after hearing of the Centralia massacre.  Chief Joel Warren appointed a special detail under Sgt. P. F. Keefe to conduct operations against four meeting places and arrested 38 persons suspected of being IWW members.<br>
<br>
Chief Warren said the leaders of the Seattle IWW might have known of the Centralia "plot," but that the rank and the file were ignorant of any such knowledge.<br>
<br>
The Spokane post of the American Legion demanded that city and county authorities take immediate steps to deport all IWWs and offered the services of its 2,700 members as deputies.<br>
<br>
E. A. Klebba, state adjutant of the American Legion, said 11,000 ex-servicemen of Washington "stand ready to assemble under arms and fight to the last ditch to wipe out at once and for all, Bolshevism in this state."<br>
<br>
Capt. J. R. Dean of the Elmer Noble Post No. 1, in Seattle, said
the rank and file of the Legion could be held in check and that they would act only with the consent and cooperation of organized authority.  But he warned that "no one could predict the immediate future if efforts of peaceful authorities to round up agitators failed to accomplish the annihilation of the organization."<br>
<br>
The Seattle post also sent a resolution to the national convention of the Legion, now meeting in Minneapolis, blaming the Centralia tragedy on the "failure of the federal government to prosecute or deport men preaching sedition."<br>
<br>
That the Centralia massacre had an impact on that national convention is shown in the statement made today by Milton J. Foreman, the Illinois state commander.  He said his state would organize an "Americanization  Committee" of vigilantes to detect radicalism of all types.<br>
<br>
"We are determined that there shall be no repetition of the Centralia tragedy in our state," he said.<br>
<br>
Such a committee is patrolling Centralia today and it has been heavy-handed at times.<br>
<br>
At the Wilkins Pool Room on Tower Avenue a patron uttered some uncomplimentary remarks regarding the manner in which radicals have been handled here.  Someone told a citizens' group about his statement.  Five minutes later a squad of Legionnaires appeared, ordered the 100 men present to raise their hands and subjected them to search.  They arrested 16 men with IWW cards.<br>
<br>
Other groups of ex-soldiers meet every train and if they have any suspicions about passengers, they are searched and jailed for investigation.  Those who pass the investigation are allowed to go about their business.  Others are placed on outgoing trains under armed guard and told to stay out of town.<br>
<br>
Centralians have taken the law into their own hands with radicals before.  They took a blind newsman, Tom Lassiter, from his newsstand (which they burned) and dumped him outside of town with a warning not to come back.  That happened last June 30, and when Lassiter later returned to the city he was indicted for criminal syndicalism for selling radical papers.  He still is in jail in Chehalis, the county seat.<br>
<br>
Though all of the cries against the IWW, only one voice has come out in support.  The Seattle Central Labor Council yesterday pass a resolution placing the blame on the "lawless business element of Centralia."<br>
     
The resolution opposed violence but asked that judgement against the IWW be withheld until that organization was given a chance to state its version.<br>
<br>
Regardless of whose version is true, the fact remains that four young men will be buried here Saturday, struck down in the prime of their lives, and another young man - like them a war veteran - lies in an unmarked grave.  And a state seethes.<br>
<br>
*        *       *<br>
<br>
The state brought first-degree murder charges against 12 IWW members.  The trial began in February, 1920, in Montesano, the county seat of Grays Harbor County.  The trial was held in a circus atmosphere, with a Legion encampment on the courthouse grounds.<br>
<br>
Attorney Elmer Smith, Mike Sheehan and Bert Faulkner were acquitted; Tom Morgan turned state's evidence and disappeared after the trail; Loren Roberts was adjudged insane - the IWW claimed from the tortures he was subjected to after his arrest.<br>
<br>
Eugene Barnett, John Lamb, O. C. Bland, Bert Bland, Britt Smith, James McInerney and Ray Becker were found guilty of second degree murder and, despite the jury's recommendation for clemency, were sentenced to 25 to 40 years in the state penitentiary.  The men lynched Wesley Everest were never brought to trial.<br>

IWW<br>
<br>
Doug Honig, "One Big Union," <B>The Weekly.</B> May 8, 1985, as reprinted in <B>Landmarks.</B> IV # 1 , p. 69-73.<br>
<br>
The radio interview with a Wobbly Thad barely begun when I commit-
ted the unpardonable sin of referring to his organization as the International Workers of the World.  Retribution came swiftly.  My guest interjected a pointed reminder that he belonged to the Industrial Workers of the World.<br>
<br>
Didn't I realize that "International . . . of the World" would be a silly redundancy? This inability even to get their name right-a faux pas I've often seen repeated in print-typifies the way Northwesterners treat the IWW.  
A lot of us want to talk nostalgically about Wobblies, but few know much about them.<br>
<br>
These radical unionists have acquired a near-mythical status, standing as romantic symbols of a rebellious past that still fascinates Washingtonians.  The term "Wobbly" itself has come to serve as a generic handle for any old-time activist, to be credited-undeservedlywith everything from the Seattle General Strike to James Farley's reputed toabt to "the Soviet of Washington." But the real legacy of the Wobblies-their flesh-
and-blood accomplishments and failures-is rarely understood.<br>
<br>
So let's get some facts straight.  The Industrial Workers of the World, thank you, is a labor group founded at a convention in Chicago in 1905.  Its guiding principle was "industrial unionism," the notion that all workers in a given industry should be organized in the same union.  These groupings would some day join together in One Big Union of all workers, skilled and unskilled, men and women, black and white alike.<br>
<br>
The One Big Union would run society as a Cooperative Commonwealth, thereby ending the reign of greedy capitalists.  The IWW's founders were a bit vague as to how this remarkable transformation would come about, but their message of worker solidarity was unmistakable.  The preamble to the IWW constitution got right to the point.  "The working class and the employing class have nothing in common," it proclaimed.<br>
<br>
As for the nickname by which they are best known-"the Wobblies"-no definitive account exists of its origin.  A popular IWW tale holds that a Chinese restaurateur, sympathetic to the union but tongue-tied by the letter w, could only   manage   "Eye-Wobbly-Wobbly." A variant ascribes the naming to the group's many Scandinavian immigrant members, who similarly tripped in pronouncing "Wobble-You."<br>
<br>
Whatever one calls them, the Industrial Workers of the World flourished for a ten-year period-before the rise of the Communist Party-as the most dynamic, most feared radicals in America.  They organized workers and won victories in places no other union had reached.  In turn, they were targets of as intense a campaign of repression as any domestic political group has faced.  The IWW continues to exist today in skeletal form, a reminder of the passion that once fired America's labor movement.<br>
<br>
The Wobblies were not the first group to talk of uniting all producers and abolishing wage labor.  Their unique genius lay in expressing class politics in terms clear to any working person.  They put Marxist ideology in an American idiom.  Toilers in Tacoma's sawmills cared little about distinctions between
bourgeoisie and petit bourgeoisie.  But when Wobs lambasted the police as "the slugging committee of the capitalist class," the lowliest sawyer knew what they meant.<br>
<br>
Most Wobbly literature displayed a dramatic verve, a biting wit, a smirk in the face of authority.  New recruits could peruse the union's press for reports from the front lines of class warfare, written in the salty language of rankand-file fighters.  Habitues of freight trains and employment offices would find thousands of small IWW stickers with pungent advice to the downtrodden:<br>
The hours are long,<br>
The pay is small.<br>
So take your time<br>
And buck them all.<br>
<br>
The spirit was best captured in the union's celebrated songs, rendered with gusto and frequency.  Most were simply clever parodies of dancehall and religious tuines of the day; the likes of "Take It to the Lord in Prayer" would emerge born-again as "Dump the Bosses Off Your back."<br>
<br>
The IWW purported to speak for all the toiling masses, but their main appeal was to those on the lowest rungs of the economic ladder: the unskilled, immigrants, women, and racial minorities. in the West, the Wobs drew support from a large reservoir of migratory laborersloggers, harvest hands, miners, and construction workers.  These were mostly young, single males without home or family ties, who wandered from job to job.<br>
<br>
These workers had been neglected by the established unions of the American Federatiori of Labor (AFL), which represented ttie labor aristocracy of skilled craftsmen.  By contrast, the IWW was specially suited to the outcasts of the labor movement.  Membership was open to all wage earners, regardless of race, sex, or trade.  Initiation fees and monthly dues were low, and the Wobblies' red card of niembership-a little booklet with spacc:s for dues stamps-was transferable when a worker switched jobs.<br>
<br>
One had only to agree to abide by the IWW coiristitution and rules and to study diligently its principles to be welcometi into the ranks.<br>
<br>
One stronghold of the Wobblies' appeal was the Pacific Northwest.  With an economy dependent on migratory musclemen in timber forests and harvest fields, wiith cities where hoboes gathered in cheap hotels to spend the winter, the region was a natural breeding ground for the IWW's brand of radicalism.  Orators denouncing the
depreciations of "the master class" became fixures on Skid Road corners.<br>
<br>
Within a couple years of its founding, the organization was boasting of several hundred Puget Sound members at branches in Seattle, Ballard, Tacoma, and outlying mill towns.<br>
<br>
Wobblies from the Northwest played an important role in shaping the 
identity of <B>the </B>national union.  It had begun as an amalgam of 
organizers and ideologues bound together only by a belief <B>in 
</B>industrial unions and contempt for the AF.L. Early national conventions turned into factional donnybrooks.<br>
<br>
A major dispute at the 1908 convention gives the flavor.  This battle was over political strategy.  Socialists like Daniel DeLeon supported electoral politics, while other members scorned the<br>
ballot box in favor of "direct action' battling bosses right on the job.  A key block of votes in the direct-action camp came from a crew of migratories assembled in Portland by organizer James H. Walsh.<br>
<br>
Clad in denim overalls, black shirts, and red bandanas, this 20-person "Overalls Brigade" embarked on a 2,500-mile odyssey by boxcar, holding street meetings and selling IWW literature along the way.  Their itinerary included an unscheduled overnight stop in the Seattle hoosegow after armed railroad guards sidetracked them in Auburn.<br>
<br>
In Chicago, DeLeon scornfully dubbed the Overalls Brigade "the Bum-
mery" for their fondness for singing the hobo anthem, "Hallelujah, I'm a Bum." But the western hoboes helped boot DeLeon from the union and establish direct action as its modus operandi.<br>
<br>
The Wobblies first stirred the public imagination in the Northwest with their energetic direction of a 1907 sawmill strike in Portland.  In many ways the affair was a model of IWW agitation. it was a walkout of previously unorganized workers over which a few Wobblies assumed leadership.  The organizers used militant tactics to spread the strike, with roving squads of picketers surrounding mills to call out 2,300 fellow workers.  Observers found the conflict surprisingly peaceful and orderly, as leaders prudently counseled workers against violence.<br>
<br>
Wobblies were hardly pacifists, but they normally stressed passive resistance from a hardheaded calculation of who stood to suffer most from spilling blood.<br>
<br>
As usual, the Wobs exchanged verbal fire with their AFL antagonists.  To these mainstream unionists, the IWWs were
Irresponsible Wholesale Wreckers bent on disrupting the labor movement.  When a state AFL leader opposed the sawmill strike, the radicals retaliated with a leaflet blasting him as a liar and "labor faker." Support for the strike ebbed, and organizers called it off after a few weeks and some small wage gains.<br>
<br>
The size and speed of the 1907 shutdown sent shock waves through employer and labor circles alike.  "The suddenness of the strike and the completeness of the tie-ups are quite unprecedented in this part of the country," remarked a write-z in the Oregon Journal.  "Wherever the Industrial Workers of the World are organized, they can paralyze industry at almost the snap of a finger.  "<br>
<br>
Wobbly tradition involved a lot more than finger.-snapping. A 
campaign <B>in</B> Spokane in 1909-10 provided a powerful demonstration of tactics for mobilizing supporters.  Under the direction of James H. Walsh-fresh from shepherding the "Overalls Brigade"-the union leased a spacious new hall with the standard free reading room, a cigar- and newsstand, and an assembly hall offering movies and lectures four nights a week.<br>
<br>
The Spokane branch also began publishing its own weekly newspaper, the Industrial Worker, which established itself as the voice of Wobs through the West.<br>
<br>
At the hub of the Inland Empire, Spokane was a magnet for harvest hands, lumberiacks, and miners looking for a warm room between jobs.  The Wobblies located their hall on Front Street near the "slave markets"employment agencies where migrants paid a fee to receive a job.  Workers often complained that employment "sharks" sent them to non-existent jobs or split fees with foremen after a quick firing.  A standard joke was that sharks had devised a perpetual motion system: one man going to the job, one man on the job, and one man leaving the job.<br>
<br>
Under the slogan "Don't Buy Jobs," Wobbly street speakers urged a boycott of employment agencies.  The agencies fought back, convincing the City Council to ban street meetings. (This ordinance was later amended to exempt religious groups such as the Salvation Army-a move which incensed the irreligious radicals.)<br>
<br>

The union men regarded the right to address workers <B>in</B> the street as an essential organizing tool.  So they challenged the ban with a "free speech fight," a classic form of civil disobedience that was a precursor of civil-right organizing 50 years later.  The Spokane fight was the first large-scale test of its effectiveness.<br>
<br>
Wobblies didn't originate the tactics, but they refined civil
disobedience to a political art, even before television.  Men responded by the hundreds to the call for "footloose rebels" to pack the jails of Spokane.  Speakers would mount a platform, deliver the salutation, "Fellow Workers"' and get out a few other words before being dragged off to prison.  Crammed into dirty cells, subsisting on bread and water, sometimes drenched with icy water or bathed in scalding water, they showed a dogged willingness to endure brutal conditions.<br>
<br>
Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, a fiery orator who would later be canonized as "The Rebel Girl" in a Joe Hill tune, joined the men.  Pregnant at the time, Flynn chained herself to a lamp post to delay arrest, then shamed officials with revelations that guards were engaging in sexual relations with female inmates.<br>
<br>
Their jail overflowing and their treasury drained, Spokane officials caved in after five months.  They revoked the ban on street meetings and released all prisoners.  In addition, 19 of the most notorious sharks lost their business licenses.<br>
<br>
The Spokane scenario was replayed in 30 free-speech skirmishes throughout the West.  Results varied, but press accounts spread the Wobblies' reputation for tooth-and-nail defiance.  While such persistence won the admiration of working stiffs and some liberals, it aroused the deepest anxieties of the middle class.<br>
<br>
Historian Robert Tyler, author of Rebels of the Woods, a study of the IWW in the Northwest, termed this "the hobo in the garden" syndrome-a fear of rootless vagabonds swarming into a community to flout accepted standards.  That fear eventually doomed the Wobblies.<br>
<br>
Business and professional interests soon resorted to extreme measures to combat the Wobbly menace.  In Aberdeen in 1911 and Everett in 1916, armies of citizen deputies patrolled the streets, pummelling intruding Wobblies with axe handles and wagon spokes.  In Aberdeen the testy radicals forced their opponents to back down.  But in Everett strong-arm tactics by business interests and the Wobblies' stubbornness resulted in tragedy.<br>
<br>
The free speech fight in Everett had begun, typically enough, with Wobs from Seattle offering unsolicited support to a dying strike by AFL shingle weavers.  After a particularly vicious beating of Wobs, the Seattle supporters resolved to return in larger numbers.  On November 5, 1916, more than 200 singing union men sailed from Seattle on the steamship Verona.  Awaiting them on the Everett dock was a large contingent of gun-toting deputies.<br>

A shot rang out-from where was never proven and a lengthy volley ensued, leaving five Wobs and two deputies dying, several Wobs drowned, and 50 men on both sides wounded.  The Everett Massacre was the bloodiest outbreak of labor violence in Northwest history.<br>
<br>
The subsequent trial of the first of 74 Wobblies charged with first-degree murder drew national headlines.  With an astute defense led by Seattle attorney George Vanderveer, the self-described "counsel for the damned," the radicals scored a rare victory in the courtroom.<br>
<br>
Everett turned out to be the last of the tumultuous free speech fights.  Wobbly organizers had already realized the limits of soapbox campaigns.  For all the attention they brought, they were essentially sideshows, distractions from the longterm task of building a permanent union structure.<br>
<br>
As Wobbly editor Ben Williams lamented in 1913, "We are to the labor movement what the high diver is to the circus: a sensation, marvelous and ever-thrilling ... As far as making Industrial Unionism fit the everyday life of the workers, we have failed miserably.  "<br>
<br>
Throughout its heyday, the IWW was plagued by an inability to consolidate victories, to form stable, ongoing, local chapters.  In part this reflected the migratory lifestyle of its mqmbers.  Novice organizers tended simply'to tell off the boss and move on, sending the warning "Bum job, stay away" to the Industrial Worker.  Meanwhile, the labor movement as a whole was in a weak state, with scant public acceptance or government support.<br>
<br>
Another problem stemmed from the IWW's split personality: it was a labor union striving to improve wages and conditions on the job, and it was a revolutionary icadre working to overthrow capitalism.  In theory the dual functions were compatible, as Wobblies believed that job actions for short-run gains served as drills for the ultimate task of dumping the bosses.  In practice, the two were hard to reconcile.  The radicals at times seemed hostile to the nuts and bolts of union operation, as when they derided sickness and death funds as "coffin benefits."<br>
<br>
A distinctive feature of IWW strategy was opposition to signing contracts with employers.  These agreements were the bread and butter of AFL unions, but the radicals regarded union contracts as unholy alliances with mortal enemies, "death warrants of labor," in the phrase of organizer Big Bill Haywood.  The reasoning ran that since the strike was the crucial weapon in the ongoing class struggle, workers should make no bargain to restrict its use.<br>

This revolutionary stance naturally maae employers loath to deal with the IWW in businessmen's eyes, Wobbly organizers seemed utterly unreasonable since-unlike their AFL counterpartsthey couldn't be relied upon to provide a disciplined work force.<br>
<br>
"Their policy is to demand more and work less until industry is ruined," ran a typical complaint in a lumber-industry journal.  Yet<br>
the Wobblies' most lasting impact on the Northwest came precisely from trying to function as an everyday union in its lumber industry.  Organizers were active in mills where wood was processed, but their greatest strength was in the forests where timber was harvested.<br>
<br>
Northwest wages in the forests were relatively high compared with elsewhere in the industry, so disputes more often raged over the terms of work.  To some extent, harsh conditions were unavoidable.  Logging was strenuous physical toil performed outdoors in the rain and far from the comforts of city life.  Conditions in logging camps were typically primitive.  After a 10-hour day in the woods, lumberjacks trudged back in wet clothes to crowded, box-like shacks with neither showers nor drying rooms.  Warmth came from wood stoves around which the woolen garb was hung.  "The sweaty, steamy odors of a bunkhouse at night would asphyxiate the uninitiated," wrote Rexford Tugwell.<br>
<br>
The lumberjacks' biggest gripes concerned sleeping conditions.  Camps often provided neither blankets nor mattresses, but simply hard pallets with perhaps a bit of straw.  So migratory loggers had to carry their possessions rolled up in "bindles," or bedding, from camp to camp, with lice and bedbugs frequent companions.  The men were "timber beasts," said the Wobblies, a virtual subspecies of humans in the eyes of employers and city dwellers.<br>
<br>
To lonely bindlestiffs in the deep woods, the Wobblies offered the fellowship of a common cause-a community of shared songs, literature, and exhortations to get up and do something to improve their lot.  The union gave a means of political action on the job and a focus for social life off the job.  It provided a sense of self-respect and hope.  As Marxists, the Wobblies believed that bosses were parasites living off the labor of people who actually produced the wealth.  Their gospel taught that by organizing together workers could reclaim their just desserts-and their proper place in history.<br>
<br>
By 1912 the IWW had enough followers among timber workers to form its first industry-wide union.  It was an exemplar of the Wobs' egalitarian philosophy, aiming to represent everybody from woodchoppers and sawyers to game wardens and collectors of bark and sap.  A notable success came with a strike of 5,000 men around Puget Sound that won clean blankets and mattresses with springs in
some camps.  Yet the new union was defunct in a year.<br>
<br>
A major handicap lay in giving practical aid to men who worked far from headquarters in cities.  So the Wobblies devised a system of "job delegates" that brought the union directly to workers.  Virtually any transient Wobbly was empowered to act as an organizer in the field.  Carrying a mobile office of dues books, membership cards, and pamphlets, the "job delegate" could sign up recruits right where they worked and deal with grievances on the spot.<br>
<br>
The owners who ran the industry provided the union with rugged adversaries.  Logging was a cutthroat, boom-andbust enterprise, and the lumbermen who succeeded were hard-driving, self-made apostles of laissez-faire who regarded unions as hindrances to the natural laws of the market.  To such men, Wobblies were incarnations of chaos and Wobbly strikes were the handiwork of a few outside agitators intimidating loyal employees.<br>
<br>
Especially odious to the employers was the Wobblies' frequent advocacy of sabotage.  The black cat-the IWW symbol for the tactic-was a regular adornment of cartoons in the Industrial Worker.  To lumbermen the "Sabo Tabby Kitten" conjured images of deranged anarchists heedlessly destroying property: a common charge was that Wobs drove spikes into logs to wreck saws.  The radicals claimed that sabotage was merely peaceful noncompliance-"the conscious withdrawal of the worker's efficiency," explained the pamphlet "Sabotage" by Elizabeth Gurley Flynn.<br>
<br>
But Wobbly rhetoric, such as the reference to sticking a pitchfork through the cogs of a machine in a Joe Hill ditty, did little to calm fears.<br>
<br>
Lumbermen's journals were full of warnings about "The Wobbly Plague." Ridding the woods of the disease became an obsession.  Employers adopted a simple solution: any suspected Wobbly was fired on the spot.  To help identify agitators they relied on a network of labor spies who supplied names for blacklists.<br>
<br>
Determining how many adherents the radicals had was always problematic, considering the union's rapid turnover of members.  Precise figures were beside the point anyway, for the IWW's influ-
ence reached far beyond its core of supporters.  A prime example was its most widespread campaign in the Northwest, the timber strike of 1917.<br>
<br>
Wartime orders for lumber to build railroad cars, cargo ships, and army housing had rescued the timber industry from a cyclical slump. 
Buoyed by the demand for labor, Wobbly representatives met in Spokane in March to revive the industry-wide union and plan a largescale drive.  The time was evidently ripe.  Loggers and mill workers began walking off their jobs in advance of the projected strike date.  A new AFL union also called out its men, and by early summer timber production was crippled.<br>
<br>
The key issue was reduction of the working day to eight hours, a coveted goal of American labor since the previous century.  By now many lumbermen were wining to grant the eight-hour day as a reasonable reform which wouldn't harm productivity, but none wanted to concede to any demand if doing so would appear to mean giving in to the despised Wobblies leading the strike.  After several weeks of unbending employer opposition, the Wobblies resorted to a wily strategem they called "transferring the strike to the job." The men returned to work, but engaged in sabotage.<br>
<br>
They would follow orders to ridiculous extremes or waste time waiting for obvious instructions.  The slowdown tactics hamstrung production, with workers getting their paychecks to boot.<br>
With Uncle Sam fighting "the war to end all wars," federal officials fretted about the lagging supply of Northwest spruce needed for constructing airplanes.  So the War Department dis-
patched Colonel Brice Disque, a former prison warden, to the scene.  A fairminded, shrewd operative, Disque devised an ingenious solution.<br>
<br>
First, he established a special army unit-the Spruce Production Division-to work in mills and camps at his direction.  Second, he set up a joint employer-worker body-the Loyal Legion of Loggers and Lumbermen, known as "the 4-L"-to run the industry under a no-strike pledge.  With a federally sanctioned army of 27,000 strikebreakers and an industry-wide company union in place, spruce production surged ahead.<br>
<br>
Disque also took away the rallying cry of the strike by imposing the eight-hour day on lumbermen in early 1918.  Through the 4-L, he instituted such reforms as providing bedding and regular changes of linen in logging camps.  Wobblies celebrated, declaring May I a day to burn all bindles, but lumbermen would have the last laugh.  Their acceptance of reforms was conditioned by a most desirable trade-off-a wholesale crackdown on Wobblies in the Northwest.<br>
<br>
As the bogeymen of employers and the middle class, Wobblies had often felt the wrath of both public officials and vigilantes.  The radicals' scorching rhetoric made it fatally easy for the popular press to distort their ideas and actions.  In Seattle in 1913, for example, a mob of sailors, egged on by Seattle Times assaults on
"red flag anarchists," had wrecked the IWW headquarters on South Washington Street.<br>
<br>
America's entry into the war in Europe in 1917 had greatly intensified fears of radicalism at home.  Though Wobbly leaders judiciously avoided taking an official stand on the conflict, their literature had long denouced warfare and militarism as the devilish work of capitalists.  Patriotic zealots cited such propaganda to accuse the IWW of being unamerican agents of the Kaiser, of being "Imperial Wilhelm's Warriors.  "<br>
<br>
The Reverend Mark Matthews, scourge of sin and sedition at Seattle's First Presbyterian Church, wrote the U.S. Attorney General to warn that the city was prey to a cabal of "pro-German forces, IWW fiends, and vice syndicate agents.  "<br>
<br>
Just as Seattle had been a focal point for the IWW's growth, so it became a national leader in suppressing the union.  Throughout the war years police raided its hall and arrested its adherents.  The Minute Men, a 2,000-member veterans league, assumed the privilege of spying on and detaining suspected Wobs.  Another mob of sailors smashed the plant of the Pigott Printing Concern, printer for the Industrial Worker (then based in Seattle).<br>
<br>
A committee of federal officials in the city determined that deporting alien radicals was the easiest way to dispose of the Wobs.  The U.S. Immigration Bureau began rounding up men by the hundreds for merely possessing IWW pamphlets or supporting the union's ideals; the crusade was a test run for the notorious Palmer Raids after the war.<br>
<br>
Secretary of Labor William Wilson eventually clamped down on the roundup by insisting on evidence of overt illegal acts.  Undaunted, the Washington State Legislature passed one of the nation's first "criminal syndicalism" acts, a measure outlawing the mere advocacy of political change through intimidation or sabotage.<br>
<br>
Anti-Wobbly hysteria reached a climax with the Armistice Day clash in Centralia in 1919.  When parading American Legionnaires tried to rush the union hall, Wobs-in an unusual show of force-defended it with gunfire.  Four Legionnaires were killed, and a Wobbly was 
later lynched.  In the <B>legal </B>battle that ensued, the verdict showed how sharply public sentiment had turned against the radicals since the prewar Everett Massacre.  This time seven Wobblies were convicted and received lengthy sentences; the final prisoner was not released until the late 1930s.<br>

Despite all the persecutions and prosecutions, some Wobblies remained politically active.  During wartime, thousands of migrants had drifted to Seattle to work in the shipyards.  While IWW theory frowned upon "boring from within" the established unions, the lure of a steady paycheck produced many "two-card men"-holders of the IWW red card who also took up membership in AFL unions.  They joined with independent radicals to provide a noisy left-wing presence in Seattle's Central Labor Council.  Some two-carders got themselves elected delegdtes.<br>
<br>
Among the Wobblies' dearest dreams was a general strike-a single, coordinated blow in which wage-earners would lay down their tools and bloodlessly topple the capitalist system.  Oddly, the first mass tie-up of an entire American city, the Seattle General Strike of 1919, found the AFL in command.  Two-card men had pushed vigorously for the action, and some 3,500 other Wobs walked out in sympathy, promising to abstain from provocative rallies.  However, Wobblies were excluded from the strike's governing committee and even had to argue to gain acceptance of red cards as tokens for cheap meals at strike feeding stations.<br>
<br>
For all its discipline and unity, the five-day general strike did nothing to improve the position of organized labor.  The wartime boom collapsed like a pricked balloon, and the city's industrial work force shrank by two-thirds in two years.  Youthful, familyless 
Wobs, as was their custom, simply drifted on to the harvest <B>fields 
</B>of eastern Washington or the mines of Montana.<br>
<br>
Unlike old soldiers, the battling radicals refused to fade away.  They continued to agitate in the woods, sparking a 1923 strike which idled camps from British Columbia to Chehalis.  Citizens in Seattle were treated to a 1923 IWW campaign against "dehorn" (bootleg whiskey).<br>
<br>
But the wave of repression had taken its intended toll.  Many an organizer spent long months in jail, and those on the outside fell into bitter wrangles at conventions.  By the mid-1920s the In-
dustrial Workers of the World had fallen apart as an effective national organization.  Its energy was sapped by legal defense work and its appeal to radicals had been superseded by the Communist Party.<br>
<br>
There were a few local last hurrahs, to be sure, such as a 1932 hop-pickers strike in the Yakima Valley that culminated in a clash between picketers and several hundred armed farmers.  But when the labor movement revived with massive organizing campaigns d,,, :ing the Depression, it was the new Congress of Industrial Organizations which led the way.<br>
<br>

Most individual Wobbles kept their radical faith, though often in new arenas.  Big Bill Haywood fled to Russia.  Elizabeth Gurley Flynn joined the Communist Party.  Ralph Chaplin, the Wobbly writer who composed "Solidarity Forever," came to Tacoma to edit the local AFL newspaper and ended up rather tamely-working for the Washington State Historical Society.<br>
<br>
In Seattle, wet-behind-the-ears radicals could still visit the Wobbly hall near Pioneer Square to read the latest Industrial Worker, pick up a Little Red Song Book, or soak up tales of yesteryear's struggles.  The hall closed without fanfare in 1965, though small IWW branches still meet.<br>
<br>
It would be simplistic to think that the IWW would have achieved its aims if only world war and repression hadn't come.<br>
<br>
Organizational weaknesses and the balancing act between unionism and revolution would have remained in the way.  Historian Irving Werstein hit the mark in calling Wobblies "good fighters but bad builders."<br>
<br>
Yet it would also be a mistake to treat the radicals as simply historical curiosities.  Their notion of industrial unionism formed the heart of the campaigns of the 1930s, which ultimately shaped the modern labor movements.<br>
<br>
Later generations of activists have continued to build upon their tactics of passive resistance.  Above all, the Industrial Workers of the World provided a sense of vitality, an ability to inspire masses of working people, a very American belief in themselves and a vision of the future from which today's labor <B>organizers could learn much</B>.<br>

<br>
On the evening of December 30, 1905, a man named Frank Steunenberg opened his garden gate in Caldwell, Idaho, and in the next instant was blown to kingdom come.<br>
<br>
The monstrous blast of snow-buried dynamite signalled the beginning of a quarter century of labor-management uproar in the Pacific Northwest and exploded the fiickname "Wobbly" into headlines around the country.  The state of Washington was fated to be the scene of some of the bloodiest encounters in the warfare to come and the names "Wobbly" and "Washington" now ride tandem across the violence-torn pages of history.<br>
<br>
A Wobbly was a member of the Industrial Workers of the World, a union formed in Chicago only a year before Steunenberg's echoing death. "Wobbly," the story goes, first came from the lips of a Chinese member, who, wishing to say "I.W.W.," could manage only "Eye Wobbly Wobbly."<br>
<br>
Wobblies they became and Wobblies they remain. Soon after the death of Steunenberg, who had earned labor's enmity as governor of Idaho, police arrested one Hairy Orchard, who quickly confessed a series Gf bombings and shootings.  Orchard said that he had been paid for his killings by three I.W.W. leaders: Charles Moyer, George Pettibone and Big Bill Haywood.  The trial of Haywood, head man of the Wobblies turned him into a national figure.<br>
<br>
By the time of his acquittal on July 28, 1907, "I.W.W." and "Wobbly" were part of the American language and the Wobblies were off to a noisy start, borne on a flood crest of publicity. (Moyer was acquitted, too.  Charges against Pettibone were dropped.  Orchard was sentenced to life imprisonment.)<br>
<br>
Wobbly halls opened in Seattle, Tacoma, Spokane and other lumbering centers to enlist loggers and sawmill workers in what came to be called the "One Big Union." Woods and mill workers tramped in by the hundreds, then by the thousands, to pay their dues and acquire the little "Red Card" which marked them as Wobblies.  A soaring membership and a full war chest were needed badly because the Wobblies were aiming high and far; they had set no small goals for their infant organization.  Any doubt on this score is removed by the first two paragraphs of the preamble to their constitution:<br>
<br>
"The working class and the employing class have nothing in common.  There can be no peace so long as hunger and want are found among
millions of working people and the few, who make up the employin dass, have all the good things of life.<br>
<br>
"Between these two classes a struggle must go on until the workers of the world organize as a'class, take possession of the earth and the machinery of production, and abolish the wage system<br>
<br>
Among many of the I.W.W. leaders-and Big Bill Haywood, in particular-this was not just big talk ballooned up with empty words; it was a solid plan of action.  Small wonder, then, that capitalists began to writhe sleeplessly in their beds as I.W.W. membership rose rapidly and as loud, blunt Wobblies began to climb onto- their street corner soapboxes and harangue the crowds.<br>
<br>
"Radical" is a fearsome,, rankling word today.  But the I.W.W. was radical, without question, and what's more, was button-bursting proud of it. Among its members were Communists, Socialists and anarchists and no one made any bones about it.  The I.W.W. had no intention of merely rocking the boat; it wanted to overturn it and drown the occupants, if such action would help the One Big Union wipe out the wage system and topple the capitalists from power.<br>
<br>
Haywood and his hearty crew had stirred up a strong brew and much of the strength came from the West, particularly from the logging camps of Washington.  When Eastern leaders of the union tried to soften I.W.W. methods and substitute ballots for bullets, it was usually the Washington faction which urged continued use of force as a weapon against management.  Loggers were migratory; they seldom stayed in one place long hence their preference for a weapon that would work enough to vote, against the Northwest timber barons.<br>
<br>
Why such radical notions and violent emotions? A reasonable person must admit that the Wobblies had a point; U.S. working conditions at the turn of the twentieth century were generally terrible.  Wobbly goals and methods were extreme but so were the provocations. During the last quarter of the nineteenth century, a few tycoons like J.<br>
P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller, operating through vast economic octopuses called "trusts," snatched near-complete control of American business.<br>
<br>
By 1904, for instance, Rockefeller's Standard Oil Company controlled about 85 per cent of the U.S. petroleum trade and a full 90 per force which holds cent of the export trade.  Competition, that mighty wages up and prices down, had almost ceased to exist in some industries.  Working conditions were sickening.  Children as young as 10 worked 60-hour weeks in factories and mines.<br>
<br>
A third of the men employed in factories and mines earned less than $ 10, the women less than $6.  Safety precautions hardly existed.  Approximately 300 workers were killed each year in the steel mills of Pittsburgh and 2000 more were injured.  Conditions in the mines and factories were even worse.
The textile industry came to public attention when flames chewed through New York City's Triangle Shirtwaist factory in March, 191 1. Nearly 150 women and girls died.  Some of them suffocated in an attic because doors h,ad been bolted to keep out union organizers.  Others crashed to their deaths in the streets after leaping from windows to escape the onrushing fire.  There was a public outcry; sympathy was gained for the workers' cause; more angry citizens acquired their little Red Cards.<br>
<br>
In the West's logging camps and mines and farm fields, workers rambled from job to job, drudging for 10 or 12 hours a day for a few days, then moving on.  One logging camp boss said, "We got three crews: one coming, one going and one working." A migratory worker wrote: "Camp conditions were basically unchanged from fifty years before.<br>
<br>
Food was poor, crudely prepared, dished up in tin utensils.  Living quarters were still of the traditional pattern@rudely built bunkhouses with rude doubledeck bunks, infested with'bedbugs and sometimes lice.  There were no washhouses or dryhouses, no recreation facilities.  Men still packed the ir own blankets between camps." One logger said of the food in his camp, "The meat is so tough you can't stick a fork in the gravy." A common story insisted that worn-out ox teams wer6 butchered for the loggers' table.<br>
To these rootless workers, the direct action and no nonsense promised by the I.W.W. had immediate appeal.<br>
<br>
So the Wobblies talked, they shouted, they sang-usually at the top of their lungs.  Throughout the West, they mounted soapboxes.  They enlisted members, they organized, they slapped the face of management again and again harder and harder.<br>
<br>
To no one's surprise, management reacted angrily.  A series of "free speech" battles throughout the West was kicked off in Spokane; the first one was a dandy.<br>
<br>
Perhaps it was such a humdinger because a fiery female was involved Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, whose name looms large in I.W.W. history.  Then young and attractive, Elizabeth blew into Spokane with the brim of her cowboy hat flipped up in front to expose her handsome face to admiring eyes.  A scarf-red, of course-adorned her lovely throat as she began to talk a blue streak on the street comers, day and night.<br>
<br>
"Rise up!" she cried to the workers on Trent Avenue.  "Shake off your chains! Fight for free speech!<br>
<br>
So Spokane police arrested the girl and flung her into jail, after first breaking her loose from the lamppost to which she had chained herself.<br>

This was a mistake, as it turned out.  Spokane might have absorbed a thousand Wobblies but it couldn't handle the many thousands of angry hoboes who panted in when the I.W.W. press bellowed to the nation that a fair lady had been mistreated in the Far West.  "Tools of Timber Barons jail Rebel Girl! " trumpeted the Wobbly press, whereupon loggers left the woods in herds and pointed their calked boots toward Spokane to join their eastern brethren in marching up and down the streets far into the night and in singing vulgar songs and in being thrown into jail by a police force which was beginning to look a little haggard.<br>
<br>
The jailhouse and a quickly   converted   schoolhouse   soon    were<br>
crowded. jammed into small cells, the Wobblies suffered.  As official tempers grew short under Wobbly heckling, they suffered more.  They were forced into hard labor on a bread and water diet.  They were taken out of jail, beaten, hosed down with icy water, then thrust back into their unheated cells.  Pneumonia killed three of them, but the confined wobblies continued to make trouble as the weary winter months wore on.<br>
<br>
A decision finally came with the advent of spring.  The battle had been joined in early NoVember, 1909; it ended on March 10, 1910, when Spokane taxpayers, drained dry by the cost of feeding almost 600 Wobblies over the winter, put pressure on elected authorities.<br>
Quietly Spokane city fathers surrendered.<br>
<br>
Jail doors squeaked open and exultant Wobblies stomped out.  Most of them quickly left town, following the lead of Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, who promptly went mt to stir up further trouble in the textile towns of Lawrence, Mass., and Paterson, N.J. The remaining Wobblies remounted their soapboxes in Spokane; the One Big Union had won its first big battle against authority in the West.<br>
(Incidentally, Miss Flynn was not the only famous woman Wobbly.  One mustn't forget "Mother" Jones, an Irish lady born in County Cork, who had become a living legend by 1905.<br>
<br>
Bill Haywood wrote: "Whenever trouble broke out against the miners, Mother Jones went there.  When a bridge was patrolled by soldiers she waded the river in winter.  When trains were being watched the train crew smuggled her through." It was her habit to organize armies of women during mining disputes to harass strikebreakers with mops and brooms and dishpans.  "It's the old mother with her wild women! " the mine owners would cry in horror when faced with her advancing force.  Mother died in 193@O at the age of I 00.  No doubt she took a swipe at the Grim Reaper with her broom.)<br>
<br>
Wobbly fortunes took a sharp upward swing during the decade which followed the Spokane victory.  The dream of "One Big Union" took on more solid outlines with each passing year and the Wobbly philosophy of industrial unionization began to make more sense.  Previously
unions had taken in members of only a single craft or trade.  The Wobblies weren't so particular.  Under the Wobbly banner were to march members of all crafts and trades and even those common laborers with no craft or trade at all and with no restrictions as to sex, race, religion or nationality.  To qualify for membership in the I.W.W., it was required only that a person consider himself a member of the working class.<br>
<br>
Outright violence became a Wobbly tool after the 1908 convention in Chicago, when a group of Western loggers dominated the convention and voted an important policy change: Wobblies hereafter were to forget about political action and concentrate instead on strikes and sabotage.<br>
<br>
Soon after that fateful convention, strikes, riots and sabotage crippled production in most logging and mill centers of the Northwest.  It was the beginning of a decade of trouble in the lumber industry as the Wob symbol of sabotage, a wickedly grinning black cat, appeared frequently on stickers pasted to doors and windows of lumber firms marked for harassment.<br>
<br>
In self defense, management stiffened its back, hired more Pinkerton strikebreakers and dug in.  Now the Wobblies and the bosses were on a collision course and neither showed the least disposition to turn aside.  Mass murder was inevitable.<br>
<br>
It came first in Everett, on the afternoon of Sunday, November 5, 19 16.  Under a bright sun, the Everett Massacre thundered into histofyBut the trouble did not come out of a clear sky; thefe was background.  The I.W.W. had stirred up trouble during a shingle mill strike at the Puget Sound town.  Authorities ran about 40 Wobs out of town, no big thing in itself, but they chose to force the men to run between two lines of huskies bearing pick handles on their way out; some Wobbly blood flowed.<br>
<br>
The Seattle I.W.W. cried out for revenge and announced angrily that it would sail to Everett en masse on the following Sunday and a picnic was not on the agenda.  On that day, almost 300 Wobblies boarded the steamers Verona and Calirta.  Bellowing songs from the Wobbly songbook, the men on the Verona were in high spirits as their ship left Seattle harbor ahead of the Calista and steamed toward Everett.  Some of them were sin-ainly their last songs . . .<br>
Police and vigilantes waited on the whaff at Everett, their mission plain: keep the Wobs from landing.<br>
<br>
Firing broke out; men screamed. (Police said the first gunshots came from the Verona,- the Wobs said they came from the wharf; the truth probably will never be known.) The water around the ship soon went red with the blood of the dead and wounded.
When the firing stopped, the skipper of the Verona frantically backed his ship out of range, then turned and ran at full steam for Seattle, meeting the Calirta along the way.  Told of the Everett battle, the Calistds captain swung his craft and followed the Verona back to Seattle.<br>
<br>
Five Wobblies and two vigilantes had died in the brief outburst of murder.  Almost 60 men were'wounded. (The names of the Wobbly dead say something about the take-all-comers character of the organization:<br>
<br>
Felix Baran, a Frenchman; Hugo Gerlat, a German; Gustav Johnson, a<br>
Swede; John Looney, an Irishman; and Abraham Rabinowitz, a Russian<br>
Jew.)<br>
<br>
Seventy-four Wobblies were arrested off the ships at Seattle, despite the fact that police found no firearms on the ships, only clubs and packages of red pepper. (It would have been easy, of course-and wise-for the Wobblies to throw their guns into Puget Sound.)<br>
<br>
An important Washington Wobbly, Tom Tracy, was first to go on trial for the Everett Massacre.  During a two-month hearing, his lawyers argued that it was impossible to tell who had fired the first shot; they pointed out, too, that the two dead vigilantes might well have been shot by their own kind during the wild scramble on the pier.<br>
<br>
Tracy went free, as did the other 73 Wobbly defendants.  No one was ever tried for killing the five Wobblies.  The Everett Massacre, when all was said and done, was a publicity bonanza for the I.W.W. As was their habit, they milked it dry.<br>
<br>
But big, new trouble for the Wobblies was just around the corner.<br>
The I.W.W. had been loud in its opposition to U.S. entry into World War 1. When the U.S. declared war against Germany, it would have been wise for the Wobblies to simmer down.  They didn't, of course.<br>
<br>
Instead they urged Wobblies to refuse service in the armed forces and staged crippling, frustrating strikes in war industries.<br>
Outraged howls rose from the middle class around the country.  War fervor combined with fear of Wobblies to set off many ugly episodes.  Open season was declared on Wobblies.  The Los Angeles Times snorted: "A vast number of I.W.W.s are non-producers.  I.W.W. stands for 'I won't work' and 'I want whiskey'.  The average Wobbly, it must be remembered, is a sort of half-wild animal.<br>
<br>
"He lives on the road, cooks his food in rusty tin cans . and sleeps in 'jungles,' barns ' outhouses, freight cars . . . They are all in all a lot of homeless men wandering about the country without fixed destination or purpose, other than destruction."
The Wobblies didn't help matters one bit by printing sarcastic bits of verse in their newspaper, Industrial Worker, such as the following:<br>
<br>
I LOVE MY FLAG<br>
<br>
I love my flag, I do, I do,<br>
Which floats upon the breeze.<br>
I also love my arms and legs,<br>
And neck and nose and knees.<br>
One little shell might spoil them all<br>
Or give them such a twist<br>
<br>
They would be of no use to me<br>
I guess I  won't  enlist.<br>
<br>
I love my country, yes, I do,<br>
I hope her folks do well.<br>
Without our arms and legs and things,<br>
I think we'd look like hell.<br>
Young men with faces half shot off<br>
Are unfit to be kissed,<br>
I've read in books it spoils their looks;<br>
I guess I won't enlist.<br>
ANONYMOUS, Industrial WOrke-r<br>
April 14, 1917<br>
<br>
And so the wild Wobblies forced the hand of the federal government. in September, 1917, five months after the declaration of war, federal agents swooped down on I.W.W- offices around the country and confiscated evidence against the union.  The next year, in Chicago, l00 Wobbly leaders were tried on charges of obstructing the war effort.  They were found guilty on all counts and sentenced to long terms in Leavenworth Prison.<br>
<br>
The Wobblies didn't know it (or wouldn't admit it) but they were finished as a major force in America.  They stirred up a general strike in Seattle in February, 1919, and made it sound like a revolution aborning but it accomplished little more than to set thousands of inconvenienced citizens permanently against the I.W.W. on the first day of the strike, 60,000 workers stayed home.<br>
<br>
Mayor Ole Hanson threatened to use troops then never did.  The strike committee had set no terminal date for the strike, so it limped along.  The committee couldn't end it without seeming to give in to management.  Strikers began to sneak back to work and soon the strike which had been advertised as the kick-Off of a national revolution had all the drama and excitement of a dead herring.<br>
<br>
But no one really expected the I.W.W. to go out with a whimper, not
in Washington nor anywhere else.  That which lives in violence often dies in violence and the last great outpouring of blood was to take place in Centralia, Washington.<br>
<br>
There are three paramount Wobbly heroes: Joe Hill, Frank Little and Wesley Everest.  All died martyr's deaths.  Hill was a Swe&h immigraflt who wrote stirring words for the Wobbly songbook.  Hill was executed in Utah in 1915 for allegedly killing a Utah grocer during a robbery.<br>
<br>
He may have deserved execution, but Wobblies will always believe that his death was ordered by the copper mining kings.  Little, half-Indian and proud of it, was a master organizer.  Masked men lynched Frank Little in Butte, Mcintana, in 1917, after first dragging him, his previously broken leg in a cast, by a rope behind a car.<br>
<br>
Wes Everest was neither poet nor organizer; he merely happened to be sitting in the I.W.W. hall in Centralia, Washington, on Armistice Day, 1919.  Yet Wes Everest's name rings out as loud and clear as any in the Wobbly Valhalla.<br>
<br>
As 1919 wore on, lumbermen in Centralia decided that the time had come to rid Centralia of Wobblies once and for all and they so warned the I.W.W. through advertisements in local newspapers.  They chose a veterans organization, the American Legion, to accomplish their aim. (The Legion in Centralia had,previous experience with the Wobblies, had, in fact, invaded the union hall earlier in the year wielding pipes and mbber hoses.)<br>
<br>
The union fortified the hall and the stage was set for the Centralia Massacre.<br>
<br>
On November 11, 1919, the Legion marched, armed with pipe and hose.  They passed the Wobbly hall and perhaps they stopped in front of it.  At any rate, somebody, somewhere, fired a gun and then another.<br>
Who fired first? Each side, of course, said the other had.  Neither proved its point; perhaps it doesn't really matter.  Both sides could have; both sides wanted to.  At any rate, the legion felt called upon to break its parade formation and storm the building.<br>
<br>
Wes Everest was inside the building, wearing his army uniform. (Not all Wobblies refused military service; Evere ' st had served in France.) The army had taught Everest how to use guns.  When the Legionnaires entered, Everest rose and emptied his rifle into the advancing horde, then dropped the rifle, snatched out a pistol and ran for the woods, pursued by a bellowing mob.<br>
<br>

The fugitive waded to his waist in the Skookumchuck River.  Then, feeling the wild current and realizing that he was about to drown, he stopped and turned to face his tormenters and offered to submit to police arrest.<br>
<br>
It wasn't enough to stop the mob, which plunged into the water after<br>
him.<br>
<br>
Wes Everest fired his pistol four times before it jammed.  He snapped the trigger again and again.  Finally the gun fired and killed Dale Hubbard, nephew of one of the lumbermen who had organized the march on the I.W.W. hall.<br>
<br>
His gun empty, Everest fought the mob with his fists, but soon was overpowered.<br>
<br>
Everest raged, "You don't have the guts to hang a man in the day-
time!<br>
<br>
He was right, for what little it was worth.<br>
<br>
They tied Everest to a car's bumper and dragged him back to Centralia and through Centralia.  Then they had him locked in jail.<br>
Evening came to Centralia.  Lifesaving lights blinked on, lights which Wes Everest knew would protect him.  Perhaps, gentle citizens prayed, the horror had ended.<br>
<br>
Then lights went out all over town.  Figures moved through the blackness and soon beat at the jailhouse door.<br>
<br>
They wanted Wes Everest and they got him, threw him onto the floor of a car and drove to the Chehalis River bridge.<br>
<br>
They hanged him there and riddled his body with bullets.<br>
Only Wobblies were tried for the Centralia Massage.  No one tried to bring Wes Everest's killers to justice.  The American Legion raised $11,750 to pay $4 per day to 50 Legionnaires in uniform to occupy the front seats of the courtroom where the Wobblies were tried.<br>
<br>
Three witnesses who testified that Legionnaires attacked the Wobbly hall before a shot was fired were arrested for perjury as they left the stand; it was that kind of trial.<br>
<br>
After 15 years in prison, the Wobblies were paroled.  No one spent as much as one day in prison for murdering Wesley Everest.  The story ends . . .<br>
<br>
Where did the Wobblies go wrong? Their idea of organizing labor on
an industry-wide basis was taken over by the Congress of Industrial Organization in the 1930s and made to work; it works to this day.  Why didn't it work for the Wobblies?<br>
<br>
Well, for one thing, many of their leaders were revolutionists.  Like most revolutionists, they weren't good for much but revolution.  The Wobblies attracted members by the droves and shook the employer class to its boots but they proved generally unable to translate this power into solid benefits for the membership.  And so they died . . .<br>
<br>
For another thing, their reckless use of riots and sabotage to gain their goals brought a harsh and deadly reaction from an angered, frightened federal government.  And so they died . . .<br>
<br>
In a sense, though, the I.W.W. succeeded too well for its own good.  Its activities and propaganda threw a spotlight on disgusting working conditions in many industries.  Rapid improvement often resulted.  So, as time trickled by, there was less and less for workers to revolt about.  Riots and revolts grow out of last-ditch desperation.  The better years came and passed and killed the sprouting seeds of desperation.<br>
<br>
Technically, the I.W.W. is not dead.  A few dusty little offices remain scattered around the country.  The Wobbly newspaper, Industrial Worker, is still published.  A few old-timers still lounge around the offices smoking pipes under the pictures of Joe Hill and Frank Little and Wes Everest.  To them, the One Big Union is anything but dead.<br>
<br>
So be it.  Anyone passing the haunted halls of the I.W.W. in the dark of a modern night should not be shocked to hear the old-timers softly singing the Wobbly anthem to the tune of "John Brown's Body":<br>
<br>
"It is we who plowed the prairies; built the cities where they trade;<br>
<br>
"Dug the mines and built the workshops; endless miles of railroad laid.<br>
<br>
"Now we stand outcast and starving  m<B>id </B>the wonders we have made<br>
<br>
"But the union makes us strong,<br>
<br>
"Solidarity forever!<br>
<br>
"Solidarity forever!
"Solidarity forever!<br>
<br>
"For the union makes us strong."<br>

<br>
[The attitude of the owners of the forests, the sawmills, and other property as standard.] If you don't like it, draw your pay; nobody says you've got to say; it's a free country.<br>
<br>
Hence the unions.  On the peninsula the first unions in the lumber industry were organized among the workers in the shingle mills, whose occupation was particularly hazardous.  A reporter who visited a shingle mill in the first decade of the twentieth century has left this description:<br>
<br>
Shingle-weaving is not a trade, it is a battle.  For ten hours a day the sawyer faces two teethed steel disks whirling around 200 times a minute.  To the one on the left he feeds the beavy blocks of cedar, reacmng over with his left hand to remove the heavy shingles it rips off.<br>
<br>
Hour after hour the shingle-weaver's hands and arms, plain, unarmored flesh and blood, are staked against the screeching steel that cares not what it severs.  Hour after bour the steel sings its crescendo note as it bites into the wood, the sawdust thickens, the wet sponge under the sawyer's nose fills with fine particles.  If "cedar asthma," the slingle weaver's occupational disease, does not get him, the steel will.<br>
<br>
Sooner or later he reaches over a little too far, the whirling blade tosses drops of deep red into the air, a finger, a hand, or part of an arm comes sliding down the slick chute.<br>
<br>
Shingle-weavers' locals flared up by spontaneous combustion in aH the lumber towns around the peninsula and sound in igoo and <B>igoi.  </B>The necessary elements were all present: danger, poor pay, job insecurity, a feeling of craft solidarity among men who lived close together, and the need of the operators for workers with some skfll.<br>
<br>
In 1903 delegates met in Everett to form the International Shingle
Weavers Union of America.  The same year sawmill workers started to organize.  In 1905 the International Brotherhood of Woodsmen and Sawmill Workers was chartered by the American Federation of Labor.<br>
The operators were outraged.  They were individualistic men, accustomed to making their own decisions.<br>
<br>
Their feeling of responsibility toward their men was at best patemalistic.  Not infrequently an operator would drop around to give an old hand who had joined a union some sincere and fatherly advice: "Don't get mixed up with those wild men; we'd hate to have to let you go."<br>
<br>
Many of the employers were sincerely convinced that most of the men in the mills and woods liked taking risks and working long hours.  "Gives 'em a feeling of independence.  Makes em know they're men.  I know how they feel, dammit.  I started there myself."<br>
<br>
After 1900 all the employers were caught in the bind between rising prices for raw materials and declining prices for the finished product due to increased production.  The operators formed associations of their own to limit output and regulate prices and achieve a standard grading system for labor but they were too individualistic for their own good.<br>
<br>
W.  B. Mack, an Aberdeen operator, told a meeting of the Pacific Lumber Manufacturers Association in <B>igii, </B>"I don't see a ray of hope. . . . Every time a price is given, some other fellow cuts it.  Everybody seems to be fighting everybody else."<br>
<br>
There was a welter of strikes.  They boiled up in Hoquiam, were settled, then erupted in Raymond and Aberdeen, Cosmopolis and Port Ludlow; then back to Hoquiam, where at one stage union men were loaded into boxcars for deportation to nobody knew where, but the mayor declared himself out of sympathy with the project, and railroad men refused to move the train.<br>
<br>
These first strikes, though violent and productive of deep bitterness on both sides, were strikes for such limited objectives as a larger share of the profits and a safer place to work.<br>
<br>
They were intended not to change the world but only to change conditions in a given plant.  Then along came the Industrial Workers of the World, born of a meeting of forty three unions in Chicago in 1905.<br>
<br>

The I. W. W., or Wobblies, as they soon came to be called, didn't ask for a larger slice of the economic melon; they wanted the whole thing, flesh, rind, and pits, and they wanted it right away.  The Wobblies believed in world revolution, not in the distant future but today.  The Red Dawn would not be tomorrow but had come yesterday, and the Wobblies were at war with society.  They claimed no common ground with the employer except the industrial battlefield.<br>
<br>
They considered the craft unions, even the militant shingle weavers, to be merely creatures of the employers, nursemaids of reaction, traitors to the working class.  They quoted Mark Hanna on "the labor lieutenants of the captains of industry but they didn't mean this as a compliment.<br>
<br>
The Wobblies considered themselves soldiers in a battle already joined.  They were brave, unreasonable, ingenious, cantankerous, violent.  To the rootless men in the forest camps they offered an outlet for frustration more exciting than a brothel.  The I. W. W. appealed to idealists wbo wanted a better world and to outsized juvenile delinquents in corked boots wbo wanted to smash back at a world they never made.  The Wobs were every bit as rough as the conditions that spawned them.<br>
<br>
There were Wobbly halls in all the lumber towns, usually somewhere along the skid road, preferably near the "slave markets," as the employment agencies were known.  These headquarters were bare, beat-up buildings, furnished with battered chairs and decorated with pictures of Joe Hill, the romantic radical poet who was executed by a firing squad in Utah for a hold-up he perhaps did not commit and thereby became for the Wobblies that martyr without whom no cause can be complete.<br>
<br>
These halls were raided diligently by town police, and also by such elements of the outraged citizenry as the employers-now suffering from the Wobbly Horrors-could organize and arm.  But the hall was always just a rented hall; and if some of the men who packed the rigging-that is, gave signed-up members their red cards and passed out the gaudy propaganda broadsides and the Wobbly song books-were driven out of town in various conditions of disrepair, there were sure to be more fellow workers swinging dowli from the freight cars a few days later.<br>
<br>
The Wobs brought to near perfection a technique later employed by Gandhi.  When their right to harangue the stiffs on some lumbertown skid road was denied, they swarmed into the town and started talking at every streetcorner, in<B>viting arrest</B>.  When the jail got too full (in one strike in Spokane the demonstrators filled the city jail, the county jail, a deserted schoolhouse, and
an M. P. barracks) and the cost of feeding the prisoners began to damage the city budget, the authorities usually backed down.  But not always.<br>
<br>
Up in Everett in the spring of 1916 the Wobbly speakers moved in when the town was already made tense by strikes of longshoremen, tugboat crews, and shingle-weavers.  The first Wobbly organizer to hit town, one James Rowan, almost immediately got into a streetcorner argument with a craft union organizer and was vagged out of town by the police.<br>
<br>
Soon another Wobbly showed up, and the police chased bim out of town along with thirty-five sympathizers.  This kept up through the summer. In the fall with the strike still dragging on, a party of forty Wobblies arrived on a passenger steamer from Seattle for a free-speech demonstration.  They were captured by deputized vigilantes, taken to the edge of town, stripped, and made to run a gantlet of men armed with clubs and with branches of devil's club, a prickly brush.  All survived, but some were hospitalized.<br>
<br>
A few days later the Wobblies, at the suggestion of a Seattle clergyman, the Reverend Oscar McGill, announced that they would hold a mass meeting on Sunday afternoon, November 6, in Everett.  The idea was that the vigilantes would not resort to violence in public.<br>
<br>
That Sunday 250 Wobblies left Seattle for Everett on the regular passenger steamer Verona, and another fifty left on the Calista, which was chartered.  The Verona got there first.  As she tied up at the dock the Wobblies were singing:<br>
<br>
We meet today in Freedom's cause,<br>
And raise our voices high;<br>
We'H join our hands in union strong,<br>
To battle or to die....<br>
<br>
From the dock the sheriff shouted, "Who is your leader?"<br>
<br>
"We're all leaders."<br>
<br>
"Don't try to land here."<br>
<br>
Some Wobblies rushed the gangplank.  Vigilantes concealed in the warebouse started shooting.  Eleven of the Wobblies died, along with two deputy sheriffs; thirty men on the boat and fifteen on the dock were wounded before a Wobbly with a revolver forced the Verona's engineer to reverse the engines.  The towline snapped, and the steamer wallowed away.  No one took the wheel until she was almost
out of range from shore.<br>
<br>
The police were waiting when the Verona docked in Seattle.  Seventy-four men were arrested and charged with first-degree murder.  One of them, Thomas H. Tracy, was tried and found not guilty.  The charges against the others were eventually dropped.<br>
<br>
The Wobblies had won their greatest legal victory, but on the morning that Tracy's attorney, George F. Vanderveer, rose in superior court in Seattle to open the case for the defense, President Woodrow Wilson stood before a joint session of Congress in Washington to ask that war be declared on Germany.  The war made the Wobblies more unpopular than ever.<br>
<br>
In the spring of 1917 both the craft unions and the I. W, W. asked lumber operators for an eight-hour day, at three dollars, in the mills and either an eight-hour day or a nine-hour day, at $3-50, in the camps.<br>
<br>
The operators refused the demands and turned down government requests that they arbitrate; instead they formed the Lumbermen's Protective Association, which was empowered to fine any member five hundred dollars a day for operating less than ten hours per shift.  In July men walked out of nearly every mill and camp in the state.<br>
<br>
It was the biggest strike the Far West had known.<br>
<br>
After six weeks the men went back to work, their demands unmet.  The craft unions authorized their men to retum to the job, although they were to remain technically on strike until the eight-hour day was granted.  The Wobblies also went back, but not exactly to work; they appeared in mill and camp, but practiced what they called "conscientious withdrawal of efficiency"-the slowdown.<br>
<br>
The ingenious Wobblies, long adept at sabotage, could think of a lot of ways to botch a job.  For instance, they could work eight hours and then quit.  If they were fired, the next crew was unlikely to be better.  They were accused of driving spikes in logs to break saws in the mills-a really terrible thing to do, since a saw that hit metal filled the miu with flying steel.  The Wobblies denied doing this, but they did not deny that they were striking on the job.  Signs of the grinning cat perched on the wooden shoe-the symbol of sabotage leered from the windows of Wobbly halls.<br>
<br>
Lumber production got in such a snarl that the War Department dispatched Colonel Bryce P. Disque to see what could be done to get fir and hemlock and pine, and especially spruce, moving out of the woods.  Spruce was the glamour wood; it went into airplanes.  As a
result of the colonel's visit two strange new organizations appeared in the woods: the Loyal Legion of Loggers and Lumbermen, and the Spruce Production Division.<br>
<br>
The 4-L, as the Loyal Legion came to be called, was called a "fifty-fifty outfit: half employer, half employee, and hall you-know-what." All real power centered in the Army in the person of Colonel Disque.  Each 4-L member, boss or worker, had to sign a pledge to help the war effort, "to stamp out any sedition or acts of hostility against the United States which may come to my knowledge.........<br>
<br>
Though the craft unions and the Wobblies expressed loud doubts about the impartiality of the War Department in any labor management dispute, the workers did not act the worst Of the wartime decisions.  Colonel Disque became convinced that most of the union demands would have to be met if lumber was to be cut.  He finally ordered the operators to cut shifts to eight hours and pay thne-and-a-half for overtime; shortly after, he ruled that employers must furnish bunk-
houses with clean bedding and change the sheets and pillow slips weekly at a charge of a dollar a week.<br>
<br>
Disqua's other responsibility, the Spruce Production Division, was one of the oddest outfits the United States Army has ever activated-and, admittedly, competition is tough.  The Spruce Production Division was a body of soldiers assigned to work in the woods.  They received the going civilian wage for their work, minus their Army pay, and minus $7.50 a week as ration allowance.<br>
<br>
The deep rain forest in winter is not everybody's delight,<br>
but seven thousand men 3 signed up or were drafted into the Spruce Division.  After all, as the saying went, "It don't rain lead." In theory, the division took only experienced loggers; in practice, quite a few men showed up who couldn't tell a Swedish fiddle from a deacon seat and had never raised a callus.  But they worked very hard, and they were not without casualties.  The woods are dangerous, especially for amateurs, and during the flu epidemic of 19l8 the men in the rain forest were hard hit.<br>
<br>
That first winter most of the spruce soldiers were assigned to camps near existing roads and put to cutting down spruce and splitting them on the spot.  This is as inefficient a way of getting lumber as can be devised, short of sabotage.  But the men were there, the trees were there, and no roads led into the main spruce belts, so the logs could not be hauled out to mills.<br>
<B><br>
<br>
As soon</B> as the woods dried out in the spring the Spruce Production Division started laying track for logging trainsfive miles of track in the Quinault area to help the Polson Logging Company get out spruce; five miles along the Pysht to help Merrill and Ring; and
thirty-six miles from the Disque junction, west of Port Angeles, to the Hoko River area out toward the tip of the peninsula, where stood the greatest spruce forest in the world.<br>
<br>
The Siems-Carey-H.S. Herbaught Corporation was given a cost-plus contract to build the spruce railroad, using spruce soldiers as part of the labor force.  They also had a cost-plus contract to build a huge mill on a site donated by the people of Port Angeles at the mouth of Ennis Creek-the old site of the Port Angeles Cooperative Colony.  Siems-Carey-H.  S. Herbaught also got a contract to supply 300,000,000 board- feet of spruce a year from the new mill at a cost of $1-05 per thousand.<br>
<br>
The contract called for the spruce railroad to be finished in six months, and it was.  As an example of hurry-up engineering this was remarkable, especially when you consider that most of the crews were amateurs, working in rough, wet country, and at the end of a supply line bottlenecked by Lake Crescent, along which all personnel and equipment had to be ferried.<br>
<br>
The only trouble with the performance was that when the last spike was driven the war had been over for nineteen days.  Not a log was hauled down the spruce railroad, not a board cut in the big new mill.<br>
<br>
It took some time to get things untangled in the tall timber after the outbreak of peace.  The goverriiment sold the mill, railroad, and a vast spread of spruce stumpage to Lyon, Hill and Company of Portland in 1923 for a million dollars, of which fifty thousand was in cash. Lyon, Hill sold to Sol Duck Investment Company in <B>1929, </B>and they in turn sold the mig to the Olympic Forest Products Company in 1930.  Olympic Forest Products changed the mill into a pulp mill and changed its own name to Rayonier, under which it thrives.<br>
<br>
The spruce railroad line died hard.  While the government was still trying to sell the road in <B>1921, </B>the biggest wind in the recorded history of the peninsula puffed in off the Pacific.  There was a gust of 114-mile velocity, and a steady wind for half an hour of <B>i </B>io-mile force.  It blew the lighthouse keeper's bull off the island of Tatoosh, and it bowled over minions of board-feet of old trees in the spruce belt.  The giant jackstraw pile of two hundred foot long trees made logging impossible in a wide area on the west end of the peninsula.<br>
<br>
Not even the logs that had been felled in <B>igi8 </B>by the Spruce Pro-
duction Division could be puned free from the tangle.  Loss<br>
of this timber greatly reduced the potential earning capacity of the line.<br>
<br>

After its purchase by Lyon, Hill and Company in 1925, the spruce line was incorporated as the Port Angeles Western, and was used as a common carrier.  Work was started to push tracks down the coast into the rich timber country of the Hoh, but funds gave out after only five miles had been laid.  Steel stopped at the Calawah River, just north of the little logging town of Forks.<br>
<br>
In 1951 a fall drought dried out the forest.  A small fire broke out along the railroad right of way, not far from Lake Crescent.  It was brought under control and patrolled by the Forest Service.<br>
<br>
The wind shifted unexpectedly on the night of September <B>i8, </B>and rose to fifty miles an hour.  Some ember, Forest Service men say it probably was a smoldering root surfacing after slowly burning for a hundred feet or so underground came to life.  Sparks reached the live dry forest, and the fire roared up, out of control, and swept along the Calawah on to Forks.<br>
<br>
Oscar Peterson, a retired Forest Service man who lives on a ranch at the edge of town, recalls that his wife woke about four <B>A.m. </B>and remarked, "That's funny! It looks like dawn already in the east.- Two hours later the Petersons' son came in from Port Angeles.  "The whole damn peninsula's on fire," he said.  "It's coming down the Calawah."<br>
<br>
The fire swept to the edge of town.  Many fled.  Others stayed and helped the Forest Service fight it.  They started backfires, ripped out fire lanes'with bulldozers, climbed onto roofs and stomped out the cinders.<br>
<br>
"The updraft sucked burning branches hundreds of yards or more into the air," Peterson recalls.  "They fell all over the place.  But the fire was so intense it burned up the oxygen, and the branches came down charred but cold.  They were au over the roof here, but dead.  Otherwise the tovm would have gone, sure."<br>
<br>
The town was saved, but thirty thousand acres of forest were gone.  That killed the railroad.  Another huge swath of timber it bad expected to haul to the mills was lost.  Residents of Forks filed suits totaling nearly a million dollars against the line.  The Port Angeles Western went into the hands of receivers in 1953- After several attempts to get federal or state aid had failed to raise half a mfllion dollars for new equipment, the line was abandoned.<br>
<br>
In 1954 the tracks were taken up for scrap.<br>
<br>

The A. F. of L. mill and camp unions tried to fill the vacuum left by the Loyal Legion.  They failed.  Memories of the collapse of the big strike of 1917 were too fresh.  Not until the 1930s were they to be important again.<br>
<br>
That left the woods to the Wobblies.  They carried on the fight as before, and again they were met with violence, the worst of it in Centralia, a lumber and farm town fifty miles up the Chehalis River from Aberdeen.  There, on Armistice Day, <B>i-gig, </B>an American Legion parade unit paused before the Wobbly hall in the Roderick Hotel building on Tower Avenue.<br>
<br>
For days there had been rumors that the hall was to be raided.  The Wobblies had even appealed to their old enemies, the police and the governor, for protection.  Their lawyer had advised them they had a right to protect themselves if attacked.  Inside the hall were anned men; other Wobblies with rifles were stationed in a hotel across the street and on a nearby hill.<br>
<br>
So when the Legionnaires stopped in front of the hall on that chin, bitter day, the whole town seemed to hold its breath.<br>
It has never been determined wbetber the shooting started before the Legionnaires charged the door.  But when the ugly business was over three young Legionnaires were dead, and so was a fourth veteran, Wesley Everest, who had been inside the building, and who had killed at least two of the others.<br>
<br>
Everest had been chased through town by the mob.  They caught him on the bank of the Chehalis.  He was taken to the city jail, but that night he was lynched.  The mob castrated him before they hanged him from the bridge, and while he <B>was hanging</B> somebody shot him.<br>
<br>
The trial of the Wobblies for the murder of the Legionnaires was held in Montesano, the county seat of Grays Harbor.  Ten men were charged with murder: four had been in the hall, five had been in the hotel across the street or on the hill, and the tenth was the lawyer who had told the Wobblies it was their right to defend themselves if attacked.  Seven were found guilty of second-degree murder and sent to prison for terms of twenty-five to forty years; two, including the lawyer, were not guilty; the tenth was insane.<br>
<br>
The Wobblies had a new set of martyrs to set up alongside Joe Hill.  They used them with skill.  But things were different, somehow.  The stiffs in the woods were sorry about Wesley Everest and the other guys, but hell! that's how things are.  What do you expect me to do about it?<br>
<br>
"Revolt," said the Wobblies.  "Throw off your chains.-<br>
<br>
But the loggers didn't want a revolution.  Better pay, shorter
hours, yes.  Revolution, no.<br>
<br>
The era of raw violence had ended.  As we look back, it seems probable that it ended on the day when Colonel Disque ordered the eight-hour day and the sheets changed every week, for then the timber beast became an industrial worker.<br>

THE I.W.W.<br>
<br>
Archie Binns, "Soldiers of Discontent," <B>Sea in the Forest.</B> New York: Doubleday and Company, 1953. p. 140-157.<br>
<br>
In the summer of 1917 my brothers and I were working on a new county road near Shelton.  The construction gang was made up of neighbors, but for a week or two  we were joined by <B>three </B>strangers, who when they were leaving, confided that they were Wobblies-members of the<br>
Industrial Workers of the World.<br>
<br>
I had never met any members of the I.W.W. before, but others of our generation had even less firsthand knowledge of the organization.  So this brief contact made us experts in the eyes of our friends, who plied us with questions.<br>
<br>
"Didn't the I.W.W.s look different from other people?"<br>
<br>
"Weren't they beasts?"<br>
<br>
"Did they try to wreck the road machinery?"<br>
<br>
"Did they try to murder you?"<br>
<br>
The answer to all the questions was no.  The three I.W.W.s were good workers and considerate companions.  If they differed from the rest of us, it was in something indefinable perhaps a greater awareness of the brotherhood of man.  My brothers and I were earning money for college.<br>
<br>
This fact particularly appealed to the Wobblies and they entered into discussions of our plans like sympathetic older relatives.  The last time we talked of college one of them said prophetically: "If you learn enough you'll never make a lot of money, but you'll get away from the hard graft and you'll have something nobody can take
from you."<br>
<br>
Perhaps it was natural that the three should take a deeper interest in the education of country boys than some of our lifelong neighbors.  Like most migratory laborers of their time, they had no families.  Neither did they live entirely for themselves.  Many of the older I.W.W.s looked on the younger members as their sons.  And many of them suffered punishments for their spiritual posterity that the average father is never caged upon to bear.<br>
<br>
Men who expected nothing for themselves returned to the picket line or the street-corner soapbox time after time, until their faces were eroded out <B>of human shape</B> under the blows of police clubs an(i vigilante pick handles; some of them continued until their skulls had taken so much that their minds blurred.<br>
<br>
There was extraordinary doggedness on one side of the conflict, and sometimes extraordinary cruelty on the other.  From the beginning of big-time lumbering in the Pacific Northwest, it was taken for granted that labor could be had when needed, at a price and under conditions which the employer chose to offer.  Sometimes wages were relatively good and in places working conditions were passable; but those were the exceptions.<br>
<br>
It was an era of untrammeled freedom for business and scant freedom for the employee.  Before the days of the secret ballot it was usual for the managers of a sawmill to station a tallyman at the polling place to record the votes of employees.  The employee who dared to vote for the party opposed to a high protective tariff on lumber was confronted with the tallyman's record and discharged.<br>
<br>
In the eighties and nineties "security" was a word for the<br>
few.  There was security for Cyrus Walker, directing genius of the Puget Mill Company that had come out of Maine in the 1850s.  At Port Ludlow, capital of the company's Puget Sound empire, Cyrus Walker lived in Admiralty Hall, a large, cupolaed mansion where ship captains, foreign buyers, businessmen, and men of politics were entertained like royalty.<br>
<br>
Around Admiralty Hall were exotic trees and gardens; in front was a great croquet ground and a cannon that fired salutes for Walker's favorite sailing ships as they entered or left the harbor.  At the back were cages and pens for captured wild animals and an enclosure for savage Great Danes that sometimes broke out and killed one of the wild animals.<br>
<br>
At the other end of the scale, mill laborers with families were barely able to make ends meet on their wages for a twelve-hour day.  When for some reason wages stopped, it was left to the charity of fellow townspeople to save the family from starvation or pay for
medical expenses.<br>
<br>
The attitude toward employer responsibility was demonstrated by a minor incident in the late 1890s.  At the Port Ludlow Mill lumber was loaded onto ships from cars that ran on an overhead track.  That morning a car slipped partly off the track, with its load in danger of sliding down and getting bruised.  Cyrus Walker sent a workman up to chain the lumber on the car and save it from damage.  While the workman was making the attempt the lumber slid off and crushed him to death.<br>
<br>
It was unfortunate because the man had a wife and several young children.  As usual, a foreman passed the hat among the employees and collected for the funeral expenses.  On this occasion, however, the foreman added something new.  He reasoned that the employer who had sent a workman to his death had at least as much reason to contribute as the others.<br>
<br>
He approached the surprised employer and held out the hat, asking if he wouldn't like to give something. Then  Cyrus Walker answered, "I would like to help that poor woman and her children.  But I can give no thing.  If I did it would set an unfortunate precedent and give the impression that an employer has responsibilities to his employees<br>
<br>
It was not that Cyrus Walker was more hardhearted than other employers; the incident stands out only because his incisive thinking allowed him to say clearly what others would have mumbled.<br>
In logging camps tragedy was simpler because most loggers were unmarried.  When one of them was killed in the woods there was no vicarious pain from thinking about a woman and her children left helpless.<br>
<br>
But in other ways the lot of the timber beast had its imperfections.  The usual bunkhouse had no facilities for bathing, or for drying clothes during the long rainy season.  The wooden bunks had neither springs nor mattresses; loggers had to be "bindle stiffs,' carrying their bedding rolls on their backs.<br>
<br>
Camps in the "long log" country of Puget Sound were cleaner and more comfortable than those in the "short log" region east of the Cas-
cades; but without provision for bathing or washing clothes sanitation was difficult, and bedbugs and lice traveled in the<br>
bedding rolls.<br>
<br>
Payday and town provided release.  But the tradition that an employer had no responsibility to his employees carried over to the company town where life moved on two levels: on one the citizens were safe; the other was treacherous with pitfalls for timber beasts.  
One of the common pitfalls was the back room of a saloon with a trap door that opened over the water- Another was the cheap hotel where drunken or drugged loggers were locked in their rooms until the man-
agement could make the rounds to rob them.  On one weekend in such an establishment three or four loggers might die from overdoses of knockout drops, but nothing was ever done about it.  Knockout drops were an industrial hazard which loggers bad to accept.<br>
<br>
The tradition of no responsibility for workers reached the height of absurdity in Grays Harbor in 1909.  During fall and winter of that year the corpses of forty-four loggers floated down the Wishkah River-all of them bludgeoned to death or shot through the heart.<br>
<br>
The wholesale murders might have continued had not an Aberdeen citizen shortly thereafter reported seeing a fellow townsman bludgeon two drunken loggers to death in broad daylight at the edge of town.  The malefactor was arrested-one Billy Ghol, an Austrian and agent for the Seamen's Union.<br>
<br>
It was brought out in his trial that years before he had started murdering sailors who left money with him for safekeeping.  From that he branched out to robbing and murdering loggers.  He had made a business of it, using a launch and scow to take the corpses out beyond the bar and dump them in the Pacific.<br>
<br>
Before acquiring the launch he had buried his victims in the river bank.  Years afterward construction gangs laying sewer or water mains kept blundering on "Billy Ghol's catacombs.- The forty-four loggers found floating down the Wishkah River were the residue of a few months' work in the largest murder-for-profit business in American history.  But success was bad for Ghol.<br>
<br>
When he began murdering in daylight and throwing his victims into the river that ran through town, his mind was already cracking under the ghoulish dream of a world where he was free to rob and kill men without number, provided they wore overalls.  He eventually died insane.<br>
<br>
It may have been some change in the social climate of America that prompted a young foreman, at the end of the nineteenth century, to ask an employer to contribute toward the expenses of a funeral for which he was responsible.  About that same time lumber workers began joining the Western Labor Union, which shortly became the American Labor Union.  The second union in turn became affiliated with a third, which was launched in 1905.<br>
<br>
After the affiliation there were a few minor strikes with varying outcomes.  But nothing much was heard of the new union until 1912, when its scattered locals were consolidated into an industrial unit.  In the Puget Sound region painted slogans appeared overnight on
stumps and rocks along the country roads: I.W. W. .... ONE BIG UNION ... WORKERS OF THE WORLD UNITE!.<br>
<br>
To farm boys like ourselves, jolting by in wagons, the signs were a puzzle; they might as well have been in Greek.  And to learn that they had been painted by loggers was even more puzzling . As far back as we could remember we had seen loggers with blanket rolls on their backs walking the Arcadia road, as silent and withdrawn as ghosts.  Like ghosts, they were not supposed to be there.<br>
<br>
At the top of the hill going into town the road forked, one branch leading to Olympia and the other to the dead end of Arcadia.  Loggers had a gift for taking the wrong road, and we seldom drove to town without taking a few back to start over again.<br>
<br>
Usually they were grateful to be set right, but not always.  One Sunday on our way to church Father stopped the wagon to tell a big Scandinavian that he was on the wrong road.  The logger did not react, so Father explained more carefully that he was on a dead-end road, leading nowhere.<br>
<br>
"Yah," the logger agreed fatalistically, and continued on his way.<br>
The blossoming of the painted signs suggested that loggers no longer intended to follow a dead-end road.<br>
<br>
Loggers  had  been  long-suffering,  but  there  was   nothing<br>
humble about the new labor union which caught their imaginations.  In the words of its organizers:<br>
<br>
The I.W.W. is not only industrial in form, but is revolutionary in character.  It is based on the principle that "the working class and the employing class have nothing in common" and "Labor is entitled to all it produces.- It is strictly a working class organization, and takes in none but actual wage workers.  Its aims are three-fold:<br>
<br>
To organize the workers in such a way that they can successfully fight their battles, and advance their interests, in their everyday struggle <B>with</B> capitalists.<br>
<br>
To overthrow capitalism, and to establish in its place a system of Industrial Democracy.<br>
<br>
To carry on production after capitalism shall have been overthrown.<br>
<br>
As the name suggests, the International Workers of the World had international ambitions, and in British Columbia it found favor and
a nickname.  The name was unwittingly supplied by a Chinese restaurant keeper in Victoria who had difficulty with his Ws.  He had noted that the I.W.W.s, though at times short of cash, always paid their debts.  When a logger wanted credit, he would ask, "I Wobbly Wobbly?"<br>
<br>
The first sizeable strike in which the Wobblies took part occurred early in 1912.  It started in the Grays Harbor region, where sawmill workers demanded a minimum wage of $2.50 a day and an eight-hour day.  Many loggers struck in sympathy.<br>
<br>
In Aberdeen only a few years earlier no attention had been paid to the disappearance of loggers, or to their reappearance as corpses in the river.  Now loggers and mill workers received attention that set the pattern of later conflicts: beatings with pick handles; mass arrests that filled the jails of Aberdeen and Hoquiam; and kidnapping of strikers, who were taken out of town and threatened with lynching if they returned.<br>
<br>
Violence reached its height in Hoquiam when a mob of substantial citizens dragged 150 strikers from their homes and boarding houses, drove them into waiting boxcars, and sealed the doors.  The mass deportation was stopped at the last minute by the arrival of the sheriff.  The men were freed.  Many of them had been badly beaten and one was crippled for life.<br>
<br>
After five weeks the strike ended with sawmill workers receiving a raise of fifty cents a day, but the ten-hour working day was continued.  Loggers won the same pay raise and forced the companies to supply springs and mattresses for bunkhouses and to clean up unsanitary conditions in camps.<br>
<br>
Three years passed with only minor clashes in the sawmills and woods.  Then the strength of the Industrial Workers of <B>the World multiplied</B>.  In April of 1915, at Kansas City, the harvest workers of America were organized into an agricultural union.  In a way it was something like the interlocking of corporations; many of the migratory workers were loggers who followed the harvest during the slack season in the woods.<br>
<br>
That summer the harvest hands, reinforced by loggers, won a number of battles for higher pay and better conditions.  In the fag the loggers returning to the woods were fired by a glimpse of One Big Union that would better the lot of all workingmen.<br>
<br>
It was the second year of industrial depression and wages in the woods were unusually low: $25 a month was tops; the lowest, in the "haywire" camps, was $9 a month.  By spring, increases had been won everywhere, with a new high of $50 a month in some camps, and a
minimum of $35.<br>
<br>
Four years after the uproar in Grays Harbor, another major strike occurred-this one at Everett, twenty miles north of Seattle.  At least part of the savagery of the conflict can be traced to the rough-and-ready history of Everett and Snohomish County-a history written by tough-minded pioneers of business who were used to bending groups of men to their will.<br>
<br>
Groups of men had already done yeoman service in the region.  Most of the rich timberland around Everett and south to Seattle had passed from the public domain to private hands through the use of sailing ship crews; the crews filed on timber claims for their own use, then signed their holdings over to a timber company in return for five dollars or a bottle of whiskey.<br>
<br>
Groups of men had also done yeoman service at election time, and one group provided young Republicans of Snohomish County with chucldes that lasted into their old age.<br>
<br>
An army of stew bums had voted at every polling place and was lined up for the payoff when someone discovered that the paymaster had not <B>arrived. </B>The stew bums were persuaded to wait half an hour; then an hour.  At the end of two hours, with the paymaster still missing, the stew bums rebelled and started a march on Everett, where they were going to expose the Republicans' election fraud.<br>
<br>
The Democrats, they said, always paid at the last polling place; but the Republicans broke faith with their voters.  Fortunately the stew bums needed assistance to find their way back to town and their guides led them to a field and kept them at bay until the paymaster was located.<br>
<br>
Groups of the humble had helped build Everett in the early nineties.  The town boomed into existence as the western terminus of the Great Northern Railway and the capital of Rockefeller's nearby Monte Cristo mines.  Streets were built by free labor from the jail.  The practice was in accordance with law, but labor complained that workingmen with money in their pockets were arrested for vagrancy and denied the alternative of paying fines.<br>
<br>
It would be unfair to represent  the  industrial  pioneers  of<br>
Snohomish  County  as  gentlemen  with  two  standards  of justice,<br>
one for use among themselves and the agreements with labor.  They were consistent.  There was the time Everett wrested the county seat from the older town of Snohomish; the question had been decided by the voters at the polling places, but it took a court order and careful timing to remove the records to the winning town.<br>
<br>
Snohomish citizens responded by preparing a special train for the
invasion of Everett.  There, while a state senator and a judge made a show of congratulating the winners, riflemen would pour out of the rear of the train and retrieve the county records.<br>
<br>
News of the intended raid was grape vined to Everett, complete to the hour of departure of the train, and the elite young men of Everett took countermeasures. They planted half a ton of dynamite under the railroad bridge which the train had to cross and led a fuse to the cemetery, where they lay in wait among the tombstones, ready to touch off the explosion with their cigars.<br>
<br>
In Snohomish the special train was loaded with senator and judge and riflemen-but the raid was stopped at the last minute by a woman who had relatives in Everett.  She reasoned that they would stop at nothing, and she reasoned correctly.  At that moment her own nephews were lying in wait in the cemetery, ready to shatter their uncles and cousins with dynamite.<br>
<br>
Twenty-two years later some of the same young men, grown older and tougher-minded, lay in wait at the Everett dock for the steamer Verona- This time there was no consideration of blood relationship; the Verona was loaded with I.W.W.s who had tried the patience of Everett lumbermen by absorbing every kind of physical punishment that could be devised.  And they were coming back for more.<br>
<br>
In the spring of 1916 Everett was beset by a longshoremen's strike, a tugboat strike, and a strike of shingle weavers at several mills.  All of the unions involved belonged to the American Federation of Labor; the shingle weavers' strike was part of a region wide demand for restoration of wage cuts made during two depression years.<br>
<br>
The adjustment had been made in most mills, including one in Everett, and the others seemed about to follow when the picture changed.<br>
<br>
In Everett the Manufacturers Association organized the Commercial Club, made up of employers, and the shingle weavers met with a sudden hardening of resistance.  Arrests and beatings thinned the picket lines until only eighteen were left.  On the morning of August 19 the police drove the pickets onto a high, narrow trestle over the bay, where they were caught between two groups of strikebreakers armed with pick handles and given a <B>terrible beating.<br>
<br>
That night</B>, reinforced by angry citizens, the pickets attacked the strikebreakers and gave them a return beating.<br>
<br>
About the time the shingle weavers' strike grew hot, an I.W.W.
organizer arrived from Chicago to sound out sentiment for industrial unionism.  The man, James Rowan, knew nothing of the local strikes.  He spoke on a street comer until an AFL representative challenged one of his statements.  Snohomish County Sheriff McRae used the incident as an excuse to arrest Rowan.<br>
<br>
He was refused a trial by jury and was sentenced to thirty days in jail for peddling without a license, with the alternative of leaving town.  Rowan left for the time being.<br>
<br>
The next delegate to come to Everett was one-armed Levi Remick.  He rented a small building on Hewitt Avenue and opened it as an I.W.W. headquarters.  He imported a speaker, James P. Thompson, who had frequently appeared in Everett without being molested.  As he could not rent a suitable hall, he advertised an outdoor meeting at Hewitt and Western<B> </B>avenues, where the Salvation Army often met.  The sheriff raided the headquarters, ordered Remick to leave town, and rounded up and deported thirty-five members of the I.W.W.<br>
<br>
An hour or two after Remick's expulsion, the banished Rowan turned up in Everett and reopened the I.W.W. headquarters.  Sheriff McRae again raided the place and ordered Rowan to leave town.  Rowan's report at Seattle headquarters strengthened the members' determination to hold the meeting as advertised.<br>
<br>
That evening Thompson, with twenty members of the I.W.W., appeared in Everett.  At the close of the Salvation Army meeting Thompson spoke at the street intersection until a squad of fifteen policemen pushed through the crowd and ordered him to see the Chief of Police at <B>headquarters</B>.<br>
<br>
Rowan then took the speaker's place and was arrested.  He was followed by others, until twenty-one men and women had been arrested.  Twenty spent the night in the city jail and were deported in the morning, the sheriff seizing the funds of one man to pay the steamboat fares of the others.  Rowan alone was taken to the county jail by the sheriff; after eight days he was turned over to the city police, who released him.<br>
<br>
There followed a lull in which labor speakers met with little interference.  The lull corresponded with the visit of Federal Mediator Blackman, who had been sent to Everett by the Commissioner of Labor.  During the quiet days there occurred some closely related events.  Several hundred strikebreakers were elected en masse to the previously exclusive Commercial Club.<br>
<br>
At the same meeting the spokesman of the mill owners asked Sheriff McRae if he could handle the strike situation.  The sheriff answered that he did not have enough deputies.  The spokesman then demanded that he swear in the membership of the Commercial Club as deputies.  The sheriff started but he soon gave out, and most of the new
members were sworn in by the secretary of the club.<br>
<br>
However illegal, the meeting of the Commercial Club brought positive results: mill owners and strikebreakers were now the law, and the more reasonable Commissioner of Public Safety and his few police had their duties usurped by an army under County Sheriff McRae, whose only loyalty was to the mill owners.<br>
<br>
When Federal Mediator Blaclanan left Everett the sheriff closed the I.W.W. hall and arrested everyone who mounted a soapbox-and the fight was on.<br>
<br>
Three years earlier Spokane had attempted to silence the I.W.W.s by passing an ordinance against street speaking.  The Wobblies had responded by speaking in endless relays and submitting to arrest until the <B>city hall was filled, then</B> the county jail, then a deserted schoolhouse, and after that the army post jail.  The city fathers were looking for more jails to fill when they woke to the ruinous fact that they had twelve hundred prisoners to feed, and the prospect of countless more; and they repealed the ordinance and freed the prisoners.<br>
<br>
The I.W.W.s who came to Everett had a repetition of that mass victory in mind.  The employers, too, remembered Spokane, and they took steps to prevent a repetition.  With an army of deputies at their disposal they organized groups for special duties.  One contingent, known as the Flying Squadron and provided with cars, was assigned to deport free-speech advocates and discourage their return.<br>
<br>
On one occasion a logging operator mistakenly clubbed a fellow deputy over the head with his revolver, and thereafter the members of the Flying Squadron wore white handkerchiefs around their necks for identification.  On that occasion forty-one I.W.W. harvest workers had reached Everett by steamer.  At the dock they were met and beaten by the sheriff and the Flying Squadron; then they were taken out of town in trucks and passenger cars.<br>
<br>
The motorized deputies were new to the business of law enforcement, but they had already experimented with new methods, such as stripping deportees and beating them with cactus like devil's clubs.<br>
<br>
This time they devised a refinement on running the gauntlet.  At a lonely wooded spot beside the interurban tracks the prisoners were forced to run between two lines of deputies who clubbed them as they passed.  Near its end the gauntlet extended across the cattle guard of the tracks.<br>

As the prisoners' legs slipped between the blades of the guard each in turn was clubbed simultaneously on the back and head by one pair of deputies and on the chest and <B>face by another.  One</B> of the deputies was a physician, but he made no attempt to help the wounded.  They were left to shift for themselves, several of them unconscious and covered with blood.<br>
<br>
When the deportees had revived themselves they raised enough money to pay the train fare of the eight most seriously injured; the others walked the twenty-five miles to Seattle, where many of them went into the hospital.<br>
<br>
There was indignation in Seattle, and more in Everett, where accounts of the beatings were circulated by word of mouth.  An investigation was made by a committee which included Seattle and Everett clergymen.  One of them, the Reverend Oscar McGill of Seattle, made the bold suggestion to the secretary of the I.w.w. that they hold a free-speech mass meeting in Everett on a Sunday in broad daylight.<br>
<br>
It was his conviction that the aroused decent citizens of the town would protect the speakers by weight of numbers, and that the deputies would not dare attack them.<br>
<br>
No doubt the I.W.W. would have attempted something of the kind even without prompting; anyway, they accepted the suggestion and advertised the meeting with thousands of smuggled handbills:<br>
<br>
CITIZENS OF EVERETT<br>
ATTENTION!<br>
<br>
A meeting will be held at the corner of Hewitt and Wetmore Aves., on Sunday, Nov. 5th, 2 p.m. Come and help maintain your and our constitutional right.<br>
<br>
Committee<br>
<br>
A call was sent out for two thousand volunteers for a free speech invasion of Everett.  About three hundred men answered the call.  On Sunday morning in Seattle two hundred and fifty men were embarked on the steamer Verona and the remainder on the Calista, along with the regular passengers of the line.<br>
<br>
Some men who had already been beaten in Everett carried revolvers; others had red pepper to throw in the faces of possible attackers.  It was for this invasion that the tough-minded employers and their deputies waited at the Everett dock.<br>
<br>
Shortly before two o'clock the Verona approached the Everett City
Dock; excursionists poured out of the cabins to the passenger deck, where others were singing the strike song of the English Transport Workers:<br>
We meet today in Freedom's cause,<br>
And raise our voices high;<br>
We'll join our hands in union strong,<br>
To battle or to die....<br>
<br>
The hillside overlooking the harbor was dark with citizens who cheered the free-speech invaders; in the packed bow of the Verona a tall, slender boy shinnied up the flagstaff to wave to the crowds on shore.<br>
<br>
The dock was quiet, but the shore end was roped off, and in the warehouses at opposite ends of the dock black slits showed where boards had been removed.  As the steamer came in, an endless file of deputies with rifles poured out of the large warehouse to the east and were ranged along the dock by the sheriff and two lieutenants.<br>
<br>
There were about five hundred deputies, some of them out of sight on the Everett Improvement Dock to the south, and others on the tug Edison lying at the opposite side of the dock to which the Verona was made fast by a bow line.<br>
<br>
Sheriff McRae stepped to the edge of the dock, raised his left hand to check the singing, and shouted:<br>
<br>
"Who is your leader?"<br>
<br>
The answer roared back.  "We are all leaders ! McRae put his right hand on the butt of his revolver.<br>
<br>
"You <B><B>can't </B></B>land here !"<br>
<br>
"The hell we can't!" And they started to run out the gangplank.<br>
The rest was lost in a burst of firing.  At the bow of the Verona the tall boy who had been waving from the flagstaff slipped halfway down, threw out his arms, and tumbled to the deck, riddled with bullets.<br>
<br>
He fell among men lying prone in a storm of lead.  Near where he fell a passenger who had no part in the free-speech demonstration received seven bullets in his body.  In the pilot house Captain Wyman had a spoke of the steering wheel tom from under his hand by a high-power bullet; after he had taken shelter behind the steamers iron safe the pilot house was battered by a rain of lead slugs.  From the slip ahead of the Verona a self-appointed deputy with a magazine shotgun raked the crowded foredeck with buckshot.<br>
<br>
In the stampede to cover, men crowded to the starboard side of the
Verona, heeling the steamer over until only the bow line kept her from capsizing.  Deputies on the next dock then opened fire.  On the canted deck massed men fell against the rail; the section hinged for the gangplank gave way and a knot of men fed through; one of them regained the lower deck, but the others disappeared in water whipped by bullets.<br>
<br>
After the first volley the deputies on the City Dock retreated to the warehouse.  Workers who had revolvers fired after them from the shattered windows of the steamer; and impatient deputies on the tug Edison at the other side of the dock fired through their ranks at the Verona.  Caught in that cross fire, the sheriffs two lieutenants were killed.  Fifteen others, including a spectator, were wounded.<br>
<br>
One deputy had been shot through the ear at close range by an excited fellow deputy who tried to shoot around him.<br>
<br>
The deputies retired to the warehouses and doctors were called to care for the wounded. The first doctor to arrive found a youth in stag shirt and overalls lying on the floor, coughing blood; he kicked the boy in the face and chest until someone convinced him that the victim was not an I.W.W., but the teen-age son of one of the big mill owners; he had dressed in working clothes in the belief that they would be protective coloring, and had slipped onto the dock, where he was shot through the lungs by a rifle bullet.<br>
<br>
The Verona was righted and a Wobbly with a revolver persuaded the engineer to reverse the engines.  The bow fine snapped, and with no one at the wheel the Verona staggered away from the dock.  When the pilot house was comparatively safe, Captain Wyman took the wheel and headed out of the harbor.  The steamer was still under fire; one of the last bullets, fired at long range, shattered a boy's leg and it had to be amputated.<br>
<br>
On the way out Captain Wyman hailed the incoming Calista through his megaphone:<br>
<br>
"For God's sake, don't land! They'll kill you! We have dead and wounded on board."<br>
<br>
There were four dead on board.  Six men had drowned or been shot in the water at the dock.  Of the thirty-one wounded on board, one died later in the hospital.<br>
<br>
The unwounded men on the Verona were jailed in Seattle.  On the identification of a Pinkerton detective who had been placed on board seventy-four were charged with the first degree murder of Deputy
Sheriff Jefferson Beard, who had been killed on the dock.  The seventy-four were removed to the county jail in Everett, where they were held for a hundred days.<br>
<br>
A change of venue brought some of them back to Seattle for trial.  The first and only one tried was found innocent, and all were released after spending six months in jail.<br>
<br>
There were two conflicting opinions about the battle at <B>the Everett dock</B>.  According to the employers, the I.W.W.s had opened fire when they were forbidden to land, and deputies and citizens had returned the fire in self-defense.  A few days after the shooting the conservative Seattle Times recorded the opposite view as expressed by Mayor Hiram Gill of Seattle:<br>
<br>
"In the final analysis the mayor declared, "it will be found these cowards in Everett who, without right or justification, shot into the crowd on the boat were the murderers and not the I.W.W.s."<br>
Asked what he would have done at Everett Sunday when the I.W.W.s appeared at that city, the mayor said he would have<br>
permitted them to land.<br>
<br>
"After they bad been allowed to come ashore," he said, would have bad them watched.  Then if they had violated the law I would have had them thrown in jail.  There would have been no trouble that way."<br>

<br>
The shadow of whiskered old Karl Marx did not fall athwart the lumber industry until late in 1905.  On the evening of December 30 that year, snow covered the ground of southern Idaho.  The village of Caldwell lay under a blanket of it, marking the steps of Frank Steunenberg, ex-governor of the state, as he made his way homeward the short distance from his law office in the town.<br>
<br>
There was a picket fence around the house.  Steunenberg opened the gate, passed through, and turned to close it.  At that instant a terrific explosion shattered the quiet dark of the night, and the
former governor of Idaho lay dead on the reddening snow.<br>
<br>
So great had been the explosive charge, whatever it was, that the blast was heard by farmers ten miles outside town and the windows on the front of the Steanenberg home were blown into jagged bits of glass that were found protruding from interior walls.<br>
<br>
The blast was to have other reverberations.  It brought into the national spotlight a young Idaho attorney, the present Senator William E. Borah.  It brought fame to Clarence Darrow.  And it produced a new antichrist in the hulking form of William Dudley (Big Bill) Haywood, ebullient genius of the brand-new Industrial Workers of the World-the Wobblies-soon to be much feared and hated and loved in the lumber industry and elsewhere.<br>
<br>
Almost a year previous to the Steunenberg murder the I.  W. W. had been organized in Chicago, and Haywood elected general secretary.  "Fellow workers," Big Bill had roared at the first meeting of the order, "the aims and objects of this organization shall be to put the working class in possession of the economic power, the means of life, in control of the machinery of production and distribution,<br>
without regard to capitalist masters."<br>
<br>
There had been no loggers at this first meeting, but there would be plenty at others, and the Wobblies were to raise more hell in the timber than booze, hurricanes, forest fires, and Acts of Congress.<br>
Where the Wobblies were, there was always turmoil and alarms, and in Big Bill Haywood they had an able leader.  He was well over six feet tall, every line in his body proclaiming the strength of an ox.  He could roar louder than any of them, he loved the smell of frying capitalists, and he was as clever a publicist as Barnum.  Moreover, he was a first-class organizer.<br>
<br>
Following close on the murder of Steunenberg, Idaho police arrested one Harry Orchard on suspicion.  In jail at Caldwell he denied any knowledge of the set bomb hitched to the Steunenberg gate.  Moved to the Boise jail Orchard had a long interview with James McParland, the Pinkerton sleuth who had run down the Molly Maguire terrorists back <B>in </B>Pennsylvania of the seventies.<br>
<br>
To McParland Orchard confessed a series of bombings and shootings that covered several years and numbered at least thirty victims.  In his confession Orchard specifically charged three men with paying him for the "jobs," including the murder of Steunenberg.  They were Charles Moyer, president of the Western Federation of Miners; George A. Pettibone, who seems to have been a sort of unofficial big shot in the union; and William D. Haywood, general organizer of the Miners' Union and head of the new Wobblies.<br>
<br>

Kidnapped in Colorado and brought to Idaho without authority, Moyer, Pettibone, and Haywood were charged with the murder of Steunenberg.  The reason implied for the murder was that the miners "had it in" for Steunenberg because of the manner in which he acted in a miners' strike in the Coeur d'Alenes, years before.<br>
<br>
Haywood and Pettibone were tried and found not guilty.  The charges against Moyer were dropped.  Orchard was sentenced to imprisonment for life in the Idaho penitentiary.<br>
<br>
The trial of Haywood became a national cause celebre.   Even before the case came to trial it had created wide interest and more bitter feeling than anything since the Haymarket affair in the eighties.  There was no sitting on the fence.  Either you were for Haywood and the others, or you were against them.  The President of the United States, even, wasn't immune to the hysteria.  In a letter that was made public Theodore Roosevelt wrote that whether or not the three men were guilty, they were "undesirable citizens."<br>
<br>
This letter made a terrible noise.  Writing in his paper, The Appeal to Reason, Eugene Debs, then a big figure in the land, made a vitriolic attack on Roosevelt.  Loggers in Northwest camps went to work wearing buttons on which was printed "I am a-n Undesirable Citizen." Labor unions staged monster parades in protest.  The letters "I.  W. W.'<br>
<br>
went into newspaper headlines, and by  July 28,1907, when he was found not guilty, Big Bill Haywood was more of a <B>national </B>character than the brilliant prosecutor, Mr. Borah, or the brilliant and sardonic counsel for defense, Mr. Darrow.  The Wobblies were off to a good start.<br>
<br>
Even before Big Bill's acquittal, Wobbly halls were opening in Portland, Seattle, Tacoma, and Spokane, and loggers and sawmill workers were the object of a big organization drive.  The fir a-nd pine forests fairly swarmed with lads who were "packing the rigging" in the form of Red Cards and other 1. W. W. supplies and propaganda booklets.  In March of 1907, when Haywood's trial was in full swing, they felt they were strong enough to challenge the timber barons.<br>
<br>
They struck first in Portland, where all except one of an even dozen large sawmills were forced to close.  It was scandalous, an unheard-of thing in the lumber industry of the Pacific Northwest; and retaliation was prompt.  Police arrested scores of Wobs a-nd clapped them into jail on charges ranging from disorderly conduct to attempted arson.<br>
<br>
The strike was soon broken, but lumbermen were jittery at this first attempt to organize their notoriously unorganized employees.<br>
<br>
The Portland strike was a mild enough beginning.  Over in Spokane
presently occurred the first of a long series of "free-speech" battles staged by the Wobblies.  When a police magistrate forbade them to soapbox on street corners, there deluged on unhappy Spokane a thousand or more wild and footloose "Rebels," attracted by black headlines in the Wobbly press proclaiming SPOKANE TOWN CLOWNS STOP WOB SPEAKERS.<br>
<br>
Among the converging radicals was a woman.  She was Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, young, handsome-with a Western hat turned up in front, and a flaming red tie around her pretty throat-and she was a hellion that breathed reddish flame; fairly sober reporters affirmed that a flash from the girl's blue-gray eyes would serve to light a Sweet Caporal.<br>
<br>
The Flynn promptly entered the fight, shouting on a Trent Avenue corner for the workers to rise up, shake off <B>their</B> chains, and do battle for free speech.  In what must have been an unreflective moment, the <B>idiotic </B>police arrested the beauteous firebrand and threw her into jail.<br>
<br>
TOOLS OF TIMBER BARONS JAIL REBEL GIRL howled the Wobbly press in<br>
studhorse  headlines  that  even  illiterates   found   inflaming.<br>
<br>
Now it seemed-and they still remember it in Spokane-that every hobo West of the Mississippi had come to town to protest against this inhuman treatment of Beauty and Womanhood.  They marched the streets, taking over whole blocks, and they sang rude songs.  Logging crews of pine camps deserted in a body to go to Spokane where their calked boots pitted the soft asphalt and their nightly howls frightened little children and all capitalists.<br>
<br>
The city jail was overflowing for weeks.  Citizens who were taxpayers began protesting against this feeding of hordes of itinerants out of the public funds.<br>
<br>
The ganging-up was too much for Spokane.  All prisoners were released, and henceforth, as the Wob press gloated, Spokane was safe for i. W. W. street speakers.  Gurley Flynn returned East to start the Lawrence, Massachusetts, "revolution," and to cause employers in Paterson, New jersey, to lie awake nights.<br>
<br>
The Wobs were now on the upswing.  For the next decade they kept the lumber industry of the Northwest in a state bordering on insanity.  Indeed, even now when violence on the labor front is common, white hairs curl and blood is pumped faster through the hardening arteries of members of conservative clubs in Portland, Seattle, and Spokane, when by chance some younger member asks who was this Bill Haywood, anyway, who wrote a book and died in Russia.<br>
<br>
Outstanding characteristic of the I. W. W. was the amazing rapidity with which they got around the country.  When iron miners on the Mesaba Range went on strike, Wobbly loggers of Oregon flooded
Minnesota.  Dirt movers of Montana construction camps appeared as by magic on the picket lines around California hop fields.<br>
<br>
In 1908 when Wobbly ranks were torn by factions warring over dogma, what was known as the "overall brigade" and was composed chiefly of loggers, jumped freights heading East out of Seattle and Portland, and captured and dominated the I. W. W. convention in Chicago that year.<br>
<br>
The overall boys voted, and their vote became a part of the organization's policy, that Wobblies should pay no attention to political activity, which was a snare and a delusion; they should concentrate on bringing the Revolution by means of strikes, sabotage, and the eventual taking over of the sources of production by the workers-who, of course, would all be good Wobs.<br>
<br>
The results of the 1908 convention were soon apparent.  Strikes broke out suddenly in all sawmilling and logging centers.  They were sporadic, never lasted long, and were accompanied by riots, sabotage, and other violence.<br>
<br>
A celebrated Wobbly affair was the "Everett Massacre." Denied the exercise of free speech in the big sawmill city of Everett, Washington, the Wobblies on the afternoon of Sunday, November 5, 1916, chartered a steamer, packed her with approximately four hundred determined members, and left Seattle harbor.  Two hours later, as the ill-fated S. S. Verona nosed the Everett dock, shooting began, and when the smoke had cleared seven men were dead and sixty-eight lay wounded.<br>
<br>
The affair created a lengthy trial, in which nobody was found guilty of anything, and was chronicled in a Wobbly book.  At least two Wobbly songs were written about it.<br>
<br>
Wobbly leaders used the riot at Everett for organizing purposes, and when, a few months later the World War came to America, they were ready.<br>
<br>
In 1917 the 1. W. W. staged the greatest strike the lumber industry has known anywhere.  Eighty-five per cent of camps and sawmills went out of production.  Spikes allegedly appeared in logs at mills that continued operations.  Logging trains were derailed.  Mysterious fires broke out in timber and mill.  Stickers showing horribly grinning black cats symbol of sabotage-were found glued to the windows of camp and sawmill offices.<br>
<br>
Boss loggers and mill operators became vexed, then worried.  BIG BOSSES GET WOBBLY HORRORS said banner headlines in the I. W. W. press.<br>

There were riots on the log drives of Idaho and eastern Washington, where river crews fought against Wob pickets.  Tough mill foremen threw Wob organizers into mill log ponds.  Even tougher camp foremen beat them up.  Genuine Wobblies were gluttons for punishment; it took nerve to be one in 1917.<br>
<br>
The United States Army wanted lumber in a hurry to build its cantonments and it wanted spruce for airplanes but little lumber was being produced.  The wheels had all but stopped.<br>
<br>
The Wobs shouted back that they wanted an eight-hour day, better wages and working conditions, and white sheets on the bunks in logging camps.<br>
<br>
Finally, the government intervened.  It formed the Spruce Production Division to log and mill timber.  It formed the Loyal Legion of Loggers and Lumbermen, the 4L, of civilian and army employees and employers, and forced boss loggers and lumbermen to grant the shorter workday.<br>
<br>
Upon this, the i. W. W. voted to "return the strike to the job." That is, to return to work but to continue tactics of slowing work, and other sabotage.  Wobbly stickers now showed a big clock on whose hands hung a pair of wooden shoes-sabots and the admonition "Time to Slow Down."<br>
<br>
But the government and the 4L prevailed, and the Wobs went into hiding or into jail for the duration of the war.  Bill Haywood fled to Russia, not to return, and Leavenworth prison was filled with Wobbly leaders, many of them to remain until pardoned in 1923 by President Harding.<br>
<br>
Once the war was over, the I. W. W. again came into the limelight, this time as the motive power behind the Seattle general strike in 1919.  The various services of the city ceased to function, while armored cars patrolled the streets.  Fighting broke out in the shipyards, along streetcar lines, and around the yards of local sawmills, and finally grew into the somewhat preposterous "Ole Hanson revolution," so called from the mayor's name. it was broken with no serious bloodshed.<br>
<br>
But the Wobblies were to appear once more in a most dramatic scene.  On November 11, 1919, in small Centralia, Washington, the American Legion held a parade.  When directly in front of the Centralia I. W. W. hall, the local contingent of the marching Legionnaires halted.  Whether by design or because of a gap in the marchers and an effort to close ranks, will never be proved.  In any case, the Centralia
Legion halted in front of the Wobbly hall.  What happened in the next split second has been hopelessly in dispute for the past eighteen years.<br>
<br>
What is assuredly and horribly known is that shouts and cries and the dry, sinister crackle of gunfire broke out almost simultaneously, and that parade watchers saw three Legionnaires go down in welters of blood.  Then, there was a rush on the I. W. W. hall, and Wesley Everest, Wobbly, went out the rear door, firing as he ran.  Chased to the brink of a nearby river, the Wob turned and shot his nearest pursuer dead.<br>
<br>
Wesley Everest was taken and put in the city jail, and early that grim evening every light in Centralia flicked out without warning.  A group of men moved into the jail, took Everest, and departed.  The city lights glowed again.  Next morning Everest's bullet-riddled body was found hanging from a near-by bridge.<br>
<br>
Whether the Legionnaires had planned to raid the i. W. W. hall, as defense attorneys claimed, or whether, as prosecution held, the Wobblies had committed downright murder, has been discussed in print thousands of times and is the "Tom Mooney Case" of the Northwest.<br>
<br>
Four Legionnaires were dead, anyway, and so was one Wobbly.  Eight 1. W. W. members were sent to prison for varying sentences.  The affair was the beginning of the end of the Wobblies as a power, and a terror, in the timber of the Northwest.<br>
<br>
The Wobbly press was as colorful and as noisy as its membership.  Its editors never troubled themselves about facts, just so long as a news story was loaded in every paragraph with dynamite against the Ruling Classes.  They were paid four dollars a day, in good times, and served but six months at a stretch.  Most of them took a leaf from the book of Hearst and kept a rousing good "menace" on tap at all times.<br>
<br>
If no Wobbly hall had been wrecked for a fortnight, or no Wob organizer beaten up by police, the editor would hitch up his galluses and come out with a stirring piece scare-headed TIMBER BARONS HIRE JESUS-BILLY TO QUIET SLAVES, the "Jesus-Billy" being the late Reverend Billy Sunday, considered by many operators a good sedative for employees who had begun to grumble about the wages.<br>
<br>
A nice thing about working on a Wobbly paper was that it was no more confined to English than is the theatrical weekly Variety today.  The Wobs had a lingo all their own.  To start with, there is the word Wobbly itself.  Its origin is somewhat hazy.  Many Wob neologists say it was conceived unconsciously by a Chinaman, a member, whose heathen tongue was not equal to the letter "w." When the Chinese wanted to tell the boys that he was a good I. W, W. man,
the best he could do was "Me likee Eye Wobbly Wobbly." It proved enough.<br>
<br>
Wobbly spread from man to man, as such things will, and by mysterious, unseen jungle-news channels, from camp to camp, until it was picked up by the Wobbly press and later became a part of everyday speech in all Western states, Wob and layman alike.<br>
<br>
And Wobbly editors were quick to appreciate other terms used by the boys out at the "points of production." A worker who was not filled with revolutionary spirit was labeled a scissorbill.<br>
<br>
The Wobs wanted logging concerns to furnish employees with blankets and sheets, so the ancient practice of carrying one's own blankets from camp to camp was made ludicrous by carrying a balloon, with appropriate front-page cartoons.  A sab cat-from sabotage-might be merely an organizer or he might be one well versed in the safest methods of wrecking machinery.<br>
<br>
A hoosier was a working stiff who didn't know his job; to hoosier up was to slow work purposely.  Pie in the sky was a cynical reference to the bourgeois heaven.  Gyppo was any sort of work done by contract and was much frowned upon.  A town policeman was a clown.<br>
<br>
The prosecuting attorney was the cutor.  The Wob press used hijack-"Hi, jack!" a command to throw up the arms-long before it came into general usage.  A red card was evidence of membership.  A detective, company guard, or stool pigeon was a fink, by all odds the dirtiest word in the Wobbly thesaurus.  There were many others, fully as pointed and all of them founded on sound etymological grounds and most of them containing humor.<br>
<br>
Reading an I. W. W. newspaper in the heyday of the order was an exciting and an interesting experience.  Its star columnist was one T-Bone Slim, who liked to razz a great colleague in the pay of Hearst and referred to his stuff as brisbanalities.  Slim rode the rods all over western Canada and United States and took time out to write a blistering column every week.<br>
<br>
And many of the footloose correspondents were good reporters.  Consider this from The Industrial Worker, printed in 1923 under the heading of "Job News":<br>
<br>
Aberdeen, Wash.-Coates-Fordney Camp-High-lead layout; two sides, rig-up crew and steel gang.  Wages: gandy dancers, $3.75; rigging, $4.25 to $6.50. Garbage, $1.45 per day.  Mattress furnished, but carry your own balloon.<br>
<br>
Slaves dissatisfied with conditions, but talk nothing but dehorn and world's series.  Two of us Fellow Workers just started to line up a few of the boys when the push hit us on the behind with
paychecks.  He has the Wobbly horrors bad.  Fellow Workers coming this way should lay off the bull-bucker here.  He is a fink.  Pretends to favor the One Big Union but when you ask him to stamp-up, he turns you in.<br>
<br>
That would be good clear reporting on any man's newspaper.<br>
<br>
From its membership peak of around one hundred thousand in the 1917 period, the 1. W. W. has faded to a mere shadow.  There are probably not five hundred of them in the Northwest woods, and probably not five thousand of them in the United States.  What caused their decline and fall is something that is occasionally argued around bunkhouse stoves by a few old-timers who don't care for the C. I. O., the A. F. of L., or the Communist Party. it would appear there were several reasons.<br>
<br>
First were the big federal raids on Wobbly halls in 1917 and the arrests, convictions, and incarceration of members.  These discouraged all but the most stout-hearted.  The Centralia affair, referred to, made several Wobbly martyrs but brought a loss rather than gain in membership.  Then, in 1924, came a serious split in the very ranks of I. W. W. officials.  They first resorted to slugging each other for possession of I. W. W. General Headquarters in Chicago.<br>
<br>
The strife was finally taken into the courts-capitalist courts-for injunctions and other mumbo-jumbo of the Ruling Class with which old-time Wobs would have no truck whatsoever.  The result of this split was two distinct groups, each claiming to be the original, blown in-the-bottle I. W. W. Chicago, New York, San Francisco, Portland, Seattle, and Spokane each had two halls carrying the 1. W. W. trademark.<br>
<br>
Two papers appeared with I. W. W. on their mastheads.  It was all very demoralizing.  They called each other bad names in their schismatic newspapers, and organizers were embarrassed when they approached workers, for the purpose of collecting dues, to find that a delegate of the "other" I. W. W.  had been there first.  The effect on simple, dues-paying members can readily be imagined.<br>
<br>
Moreover, the Communists-"comicals" to the Wobblies-bagged a number of Wobbly editors and speakers.  The Communists also continue to promise a lot more to the downtrodden than the Wobs ever did.  Although the Wobblies still spend as much or more effort in fighting the communists, the <B>CIO </B>and the A. F. of L. than they do in reducing capitalism to pulp, their ranks have been greatly thinned by desertions to Browder, Lewis, and Green.<br>
<br>
The two Wobbly newspapers that survive in 1938 seem mild, genteel, and even reactionary when compared to the screaming headlines in red and black ink which, as late as ten years ago, called upon the
slaves to arise, unite, and shake off their chains in six different languages.  There is little in them to pack a Spokane full of bellowing pickets or to cause a Judge Gary to toss fitfully in his sleep.<br>
<br>
During the summer of 1936 the Wobblies stirred in the logging camps of North Idaho, but they stirred feebly and to small purpose.  Only one man was killed in the rioting, and the principal result of the whole upheaval was to halt work, for a few days, on the filming of a log-driving scene in what Hollywood has since announced is "an Epic of the Big Timber."<br>

At Kellogg, Idaho, in April, 1899, another violent flare-up occurred when the miners asked for $3.50 per day in wages, and for a union shop.  The demands were refused, the belligerent workers commandeered a Northern Pacific Railroad train serving the Shoshone County area, and proceeded to Kellogg, where rioting resulted.<br>
<br>
At this point Governor Frank Steunenberg intervened by asking Presi-
dent McKinley for, and receiving, federal forces to cope with this situation.  The governor also declared martial law on May 3, 1899, and in turn came the arrest of about one thousand miners.<br>
<br>
The ensuing court proceedings, the State of Idaho vs. the Western Federation of Miners in which the future senator, William E. Borah, served as prosecutor, were long and bitter.  The prisoners, after about a year of incarceration pending a decision, staged a mass escape and the prosecution failed by default.<br>
<br>
In resentment, a tragic anticlimax to this event came in 1905 when a disgruntled labor agitator and self-confessed criminal named Harry Orchard placed a bomb on Steunenberg's gate; the explosion of the bomb killed the capable ex-governor.<br>
<br>
In making his confession Orchard declared that he had been chiefly influenced in committing this act by none other than William D. Haywood, then an active national officer of the Western Federation of Miners.  Haywood was promptly arrested in Salt Lake City and was
brought to Idaho- for trial.<br>
<br>
Interest in this case became nation-wide, and many doubts were held regarding the probable complicity of Haywood in the treacherous murder.  Haywood's trial, held in 1907, ended in his acquittal.<br>
The entrance of Haywood into the Steunenberg murder case spot lighted a personality whose political and economic views, and whose subsequent radical labor-organizing activities, were destined to arouse the public temper as never before.<br>
<br>
In 1905 it was "Big Bill" Haywood who was largely instrumental in founding an organization built upon the Marxian concept of the class struggle, namely, the Industrial Workers of the World.  Its members, popularly known as the I.W.W.s, or Wobblies, found the Northwest lumber camps, mines, and farming areas a fruitful climate for operation.<br>
<br>
The I.W.W. favored the uniting of all industrial workers of the world into one body and the pursuance of a radical course of action that would hasten the demise of the capitalist system.  The Preamble to the I.W.W. statement of principles refuted the old American slogan: "A fair day's wage for a fair day's work." Instead, the watchword of the I-W-W-s was the "Abolition of the wage system."<br>
<br>
Although its appeal was world-wide, membership came largely from western miners, metal workers, railroad men, and migratory workers.  Organization followed the lines of the present-day Congress of Industrial Organizations in that it formed industrial unions on a nation-wide scope, as, for example, the Marine Transport Workers' Industrial Union.<br>
<br>
Trouble followed in the wake of the I.W.W.s. In the Pacific Northwest many were arrested on a great variety of charges, especially during World War 1. Among those arrested in 1918 was Haywood, who had advocated violence.  He was charged with committing seditious acts, was this time convicted, and given a twenty-year sentence and a $10,000 fine.<br>
<br>
While out on bail awaiting a new trial in 1921, he fled to the U.S.S.R., where he lived-until his death seven years later.  In opposition to arrests such as those of Haywood and others, came bitter denouncements that the I-W-W-s had been "denied the right of free press, free speech and free assemblage," as guaranteed by the Bill of Rights.<br>
<br>
The contemporary literature for and against the I.W.W.s is highly colored.  One of the most interesting accounts of them was given in a series of articles written in 1918 by Robert W. Bruere, reporter for the New York Evening Post, entitled "Following the Trail of the I.W.W.."<br>
<br>
Bruere estimated that in this crucial war year there were about 7,000 members in the Northwest forests, that for the most part the
men who felled the trees for the war effort were Wobblies.  Bruere, in a report to the National Institute of Social Sciences (1918), took the serious view that "The problem is not one of the malice or wickedness of individuals, either among the employers or the workers.  The country," he said, "is facing a serious psychological situation" which was likely to spread if not handled intelligently.  Bruere held the view that the incidents of mistreatment of the T.W.W.s was basically wrong.<br>
<br>
He said: "ln the face of such incidents is there any wonder that the I.W.W. preaches a doctrine of revolution . . . ?"<br>
<br>
Apart from the conflicting views, the fact remains that the I.W.W.s were powerful enough to tie up periodically much of the Northwest logging operations during and immediately after World War 1. Much as the general public hated the "wobblies," there were many who sympathized with their 1917 wartime demands: an eight-hour day, $60 per month and board, wholesome food served on porcelain dishes, and sanitary sleeping quarters with a maximum of twelve men to each shack.<br>
<br>
The most tantalizing feature of an I.W.W. wartime strike was clearly stated in the Union's Northwest organ, The Industrial Worker, published in Seattle.  Wrote its editor, May 12, 1923: "Fellow Workers, the I.W.W. believes in striking on the job. . . . Fellow Workers, it is up to you. . . . Organized crews could use the strike on the job with terrible effect - with great injury to the profits of the boss. . . . Put the fear of the Wobblies into the boss."<br>
<br>
The climax of I.W.W. disturbances came at Centralia, Washington, on Armistice Day, 1919, when some American legionnaires broke rank in the parade and without legal right tried to oust I.W.W. members - including Wesley Everest, who was also a veteran - from their own hall.  Shooting resulted, and four legionnaires were killed.<br>
<br>
During the mob violence which followed, the outraged veterans seized Everest and first emasculated and then lynched him. more than a thousand arrests of I.W.W. members and other suspected radicals were made; one of these, a boy of nineteen, lost his sanity while in jail.  Nine workmen were accused of killing the legionnaires, and upon conflicting evidence were convicted of second-degree murder.<br>
<br>
Church and other groups who became aroused and investigated the case succeeded in obtaining clemency for the convicts.  Only one served a long prison term; he was released in 1939 by Governor Martin.<br>
<br>
Following this event, or at least following a lumber strike in 1923, the I.W.W. all but vanished, as did also the conservative and ineffectual Loyal Legion of Loggers and Lumbermen.<br>

Wobblies (Industrial Workers of the World)<br>
<br>
William R. Hunt, "Hard to Convict," Distant Justice.  Norman, Okla.: University of Oklahoma Press.  1987., p.221-5.<br>
<br>
During World War I radical and antiwar sentiment was no more welcome in Alaska than anywhere else in the nation, and law-
enforcement officers responded swiftly to threats of disruption of the war effort.  While some more centrally located Americans may have wondered how anyone could hurt the nation's mobilization on the distant, sparsely populated northern frontier, Alaska's officers seemed never to doubt that terrible things might occur but for their vigilance.<br>
<br>
In those days Alaskans were very proud of the Alaska Railroad, then under construction, and believed that long-sought boon to economic development might be a conspicuous target for the enemies of war.  Officials in Alaska did not accept the cries of critics who had opposed the project as a gigantic boon-doggle, a railroad from nowhere to nowhere.<br>
<br>
When Marshal L. T. Erwin and District Attorney Rhinehart Roth heard that the dreaded Wobblies (Industrial Workers of the World) were trying to strike railroad construction at Nenana, they rushed there with fire in their eyes.  While they were not sure what specific laws had been breached by strike organizers, the lawmen were convinced "that the strike was not a bona fide strike but an IWW attempt to close work altogether."<br>
<br>
Workers were upset because construction wages had fallen below Alaska's high living costs.  Thomas Riggs, the railroad commissioner, insisted that the government had prohibited wage increases and refused to negotiate.  Neither he nor Roth wanted the workers to petition the government as the strike leaders planned.<br>
<br>
Robert Smith and other strike leaders believed that Roth's only concern was that a petition might motivate the government to halt construction during the war and cause "a great injustice...to the business people of the community."  When Smith got a chance to complain of Roth's conduct to the attorney general, he claimed that Roth conceded the justice of the workers' demands but explained that railroad construction "is only a joke...a gift from our Alaskan friends in congress and if we should now kick they are liable to close her down altogether."<br>
<br>
Perhaps Smith's whimsy colored his report on Roth's conversation, but regardless of what Roth said, he treated the strikers harshly.  One man was convicted on what Smith labeled "a purely trumped-up
charge" of disrespect for the flag, convicted, sentenced to a year in jail and fined one thousand dollars without having the opportunity to see a lawyer.  Smith was held in the Fairbanks jail "incommunicado" for four months, then interred in the States as an enemy alien, although he had taken out his first papers for citizenship.<br>
<br>
Roth and Erwin had kept the attorney fully informed.  Erwin described Smith as "a socialist, IWW, anarchist, and undesirable citizen" and recommended his deportation to Germany as an undesirable alien.  The marshal appreciated that wartime ship movements prohibited Smith's immediate deportation, "but I want to take time by the forelock and have a reply so I can take steps when the war is over."<br>
<br>
Washington could not give Erwin the approval he sought, "as there is no suggestion in your letter that Smith is an enemy alien, or indeed an alien at all, it is not evident what action you think can be taken against him for deportation."  Roth followed up with a recommendation for permanent detention during the war.  "Smith, et al., are not fit for parole, I consider them dangerous."<br>
<br>
From the Fairbanks jail Smith wrote the first of several letters to Washington over a two-year period protesting Roth's actions.  Later he wrote long, amusing sketches of his life and attitudes, but in September he merely reported being "kidnapped three months ago in Nenana" when he was the officer of a "temporary organization formed to tell Washington, D. C. about the high cost of living."<br>
<br>
There was no sympathy for Smith in Washington.  One assistant attorney general favored an indictment for treason.  Another assured Roth that he might proceed against Smith under the penal code rather than worrying about treason charges.  It is hard to see how any court might be expected to find Smith guilty of treason, and, in time, he was sent to Fort Douglas, Utah, for confinement.<br>
<br>
Washington did ask Roth to answer charges Smith made in his letter from jail, and the routine request seemed to infuriate the district attorney.  His reply suggests that he may have been unhinged by his radical-busting work: "It is humiliating, indeed, to be required to reply to the innuendo of an IWW alien enemy, that I am a representative of the White Pass Co."<br>
<br>
As for "my profit motive from big business, the accusation is just what one would expect from a man hoping and praying our government will be over run by the Imperial government of Germany." There was no ring of officialdom in Roth's division.  "Smith lied to you" in saying that Roth bragged to him of scattering two hundred to three hundred men to the wind.  "A few vicious characters did get frightened.  All the rest went quietly back to work.  Now the labor union at Nenana is affiliated with the A. F. of L. Smith, for years an IWW agitator, is the most dangerous character in
every way and always advocated revolution in the United States."<br>
<br>
Obviously Roth had nothing to fear from Smith's charges against him, and it is strange that he reacted so stridently to his supervisor's request for information.  Even radicals like Smith could complain, and the system required that answers be made.  As time passed the department ignored Smith.  His letter of March 1918 was not answered because of an "oversight." He tried again in May 1919 in a letter witty enough to catch the attorney general's interest and eventually gained his release from detention.<br>
<br>
Nome's prosecutor and district judge also exhibited patriotic vigilance against the Wobblies, but jurors there resisted what they considered the government's antilabor posture.  The target for prosecution in Nome was Martin Kennelly, an Irishman who edited the Daily Nome Industrial Worker, an IWW paper sharply critical of America's participation in the war.<br>
<br>
Kennelly figured that the United States had no business bailing out an oppressive nation like England.  Let the Kaiser and Johnny Bull fight their own battles, he argued.  The same view was being expressed by radicals all over the States.  Socialists and Wobblies viewed the war as a diversion to class warfare and a means of exploiting workers.<br>
<br>
A Nome grand jury indicted the IWW editor for sedition in spring 1918.  Many clippings from the newspaper in evidence showed that he favored stories on American grafters and war profiteers and on the battlefield victories of German forces.  At trial Kennelly defended himself effectively.  From Nome a newsman had little opportunity for investigating either government corruption or military campaigns, so he relied upon the syndicated news wires.  Nine jurors concluded that Kennelly had not been guilty of sedition, and, most reluctantly, Judge William A. Holzheimer,  discharged the jury.<br>
<br>
The prosecutor, deciding his case was not strong enough for a conviction, asked the court to dismiss charges.  This was routine procedure after a hung jury, and judges, who did not care to waste time, usually granted the district attorney's request without question.  In this case the district attorney supported his petition with the assertion that the newspaper had ceased publication of articles said to be seditious.<br>
<br>
The paper's "conduct was now perfectly lawful and free from disloyalty or pro-Germanism"; Kennelly was no longer the editor.  Judge Holzheimer was not pleased.  "This is sedition," he scolded, "a character of case that the Department of Justice desires prosecuted vigorously, especially at this time, and the charge in the indictment is a meritorious one.  The case should be tried."<br>
<br>
The prosecutor was forced to do battle against sedition once more, but it appeared that his assessment of public opinion in Nome had been correct.  Jurors acquitted Kennelly.
Judge Holzheimer felt better when Bruce Rogers, a staffer for the IWW newspaper, was tried.  This time the newspaper language attributed to the accused went beyond a mere reporting of German victories.  Rogers had written: "We must make the world safe for democracy, no matter if we have to bean the Goddess of Liberty to do it."<br>
<br>
He also wrote: "Recipe for being an American patriot: Be willing to die in the defense of the trade supremacy of the British Empire and her subjugation of India and Ireland." This time the jury came through with a conviction.<br>

THE IWW IN 1909<br>
<br>
Harvey O'Conner, "The IWW in 1909," <B>Revolution in Seattle.</B> New York: Monthly Review Press, 1964, p. 33-36.<br>
<br>
It was in 1909 that the Wobblies made their debut as "militant jail and soapbox belligerents in the free-speech fight," as Paul F. Brissenden, chronicler of the early I.W.W., put it.  In the fall of 1909 free-speech fights erupted in Missoula, Montana, center of a wide logging and construction area, in New Castle, Pennsylvania, the sheet-steel center, and in Spokane.<br>
<br>
Some 20 such battles broke out between 1909 and 1913, including the famous conflict in San Diego, unparalleled up to that time for the brutality inflicted by the authorities.<br>
<br>
An editorial in the San Diego Tribune reflected the intensity of the feeling aroused: "Hanging is none too good for them [the I.W.W.]; they would be much better dead, for they are absolutely useless in the human economy; they are the waste material of creation and should be drained off into the sewer of oblivion there to rot in cold obstruction like any other excrement."<br>
<br>
The classic free-speech battle of the I.W.W. was fought in Spokane in the fall and winter of 1909.  There the job shark situation was particularly atrocious in the winter of 1908-1909.<br>
<br>
It was customary for the employment agencies, in collusion with<br>
the head boss on the job, to promote a rapid turnover - "one crew coming, one working, and one going." The more rapid the turnover the more fees for the job shark, to be split with the boss.  Times were hard and always there was a score of men for every job; if the job-seeker had no money, the fee was deducted from his pay.<br>
<br>
The I.W.W. had been campaigning for direct hiring and abolition of fees, but in the wretched condition of the slave market it could make no headway.  In Spokane alone there were 31 sharks doing a thriving business in human flesh and blood.<br>
<br>
The Spokane Spokesman-Review reported January 18, 1909, that a crowd of two to three thousand idle men had hurled rocks and chunks of ice through the windows of one agency and were about to wreck it when the I.W.W. organizer, James H. Walsh, mounted a chair and "stemmed the rising tide of riot and pacified the multitude."<br>
<br>
In the opinion of the police, if it had not been for the intervention of Walsh, "a riot would surely have followed." Walsh led the men to the I.W.W. hall and warned them that "Pinkertons" - private industrial detectives -in the crowd were trying to provoke trouble so "they would have some excuse for shooting you down or smashing your heads in."<br>
<br>
During the Summer of 1909 the job sharks retaliated against the
I.W.W. by having the city council outlaw street meetings, except for the Salvation Army.  After protesting in vain to the council against the unconstitutionality of the ordinance, the Industrial Worker on October 28 sent out a call: "Wanted Men to Fill the jails of Spokane."<br>
<br>
On November 2, appointed as Free Speech Day, the council had a rock pile ready while the Wobblies had hundreds of volunteers who had answered the call.  On that day 103 men were arrested as fast as the police could drag them from the soapbox.  The story is told of one young Wobbly who had never before spoken in public and became tongue-tied on the soapbox.<br>
<br>
Finally he blurted out, in desperation, "Where are the cops?" The cops, who had been busy elsewhere, obliged him by pulling him off his box.  By the <B>end</B> of November 500 Wobblies were in jail, consigned to bread and water when they refused to work on the rock pile.<br>
<br>
The jail filled to bursting and then a school was used for the overflow, and when this filled up the Army obligingly placed an empty barracks at the city's command.  Eight men in turn edited the Industrial Worker, as previous editors went to jail.  Elizabeth Gurley Flynn chained herself to a lamppost, as the suffragists were doing in London.<br>
<br>
The arrival of Gurley Flynn, preeminent woman speaker in an organization necessarily almost entirely male in membership, sparked the fight.  Stewart Holbrook in Holy Old Mackinaw describes her as "young, handsome - with a western hat turned up in front, and a flaming red tie around her pretty throat - and she was a hellion that breathed reddish flame; fairly sober reporters affirmed that a flash from the girl's blue-gray eyes would serve to light a Sweet Caporal.<br>
<br>
The Flynn promptly entered the fight." From jail Miss Flynn broadcast the information that the police were using the women's section as a brothel and were soliciting customers for it.<br>
<br>
The Industrial Worher was obliged to move to Seattle to be out of the reach of the Spokane police.  William Z. Foster, who had gone to Spokane to report for the Seattle Workingman's Paper, joined the I.W.W. and served his brief time as an editor of the Industrial Worker before being thrown into jail.<br>
<br>
During the winter the national spotlight swung to Spokane as correspondents flocked to the city to witness this most dramatic of challenges for observance of the First Amendment.  They saw men marched to court matted with blood from the beatings administered in jail, but one and all they refused to flinch.<br>
<br>
On their weekly march to public baths they were showered with sacks
of Bull Durham tobacco and fruit by friendly citizens.  On March 4 victory came when Spokane freed all the prisoners and quit enforcing the ban on free speech.  The licenses of 19 of the more offensive job sharks were revoked and the practice of direct hiring grew.<br>
<br>
From this great battle the I.W.W. emerged with reputation<br>
enhanced, and its fame spread far and wide. City authorities were loath to enter into conflict with an army of workingmen whose<br>
ranks swelled with persecution and whose jail expenses threatened to bankrupt the treasuries of cities even as large as Spokane.<br>

THE IWW IN 1909<br>
<br>
Archie Binns, "The Spokane Victory of the IWW," <B>Roaring Land.<br>
</B>New York: Robert M. McBride and Company, 1942, p. 86-87.<br>
<B><br>
<br>
</B>The Industrial Workers of the World are mostly thought of in connection with logging, but their program was to organize all labor, skilled and unskilled.  In eastern Washington, they had a good deal of success organizing the migratory harvest hands, and their first big conflict was in Spokane in 1909.<br>
<br>
Spokane's most personal wealth came from the surrounding wheat country, and the temper of the city was set by the conservative farmer, and by the Catholic Church, which opposed radicalism.  The I.W.W. were not welcome in Spokane, where their street speakers drew crowds of harvest hands, and gathered in converts all too successfully.<br>
<br>
Spokane expressed its disapproval with an ordinance which made street speaking a misdemeanor, punishable by a jail sentence-and the fight was on.  I.W.W. got up on soap boxes and protested the violation of free speech until they were hustled off to jail.  They went without resisting while other speakers mounted their soap boxes and followed their line of thought and their path to jail.<br>
<br>
For a while, Spokane enjoyed the excitement of victory, and then the city fathers did some figuring.  They had over six hundred I.W.W. in jail, it was costing thousands of dollars every week to feed them, and a new jail was needed for the relays of speakers who were springing up on every street comer.  Suddenly the city fathers realized that they were victims of an I.W.W. plot to turn Spokane
into one big jail and eat the capitalistic city out of house and home.  Spokane restored free speech through a permit system, and turned the boarders out to support themselves.<br>
<br>
West of the mountains there were successful strikes, and strikes that fizzled.  In the process, the loggers got industrial in. surance and sometimes better wages; the operators began sup. plying bedding which included sheets, the loggers' blanket rolls disappeared, and with them the traditional bedbugs.<br>
<br>
As the I.W.W. began having success we heard more about them, and presently the average person thought of them as diabolical enemies of the human race.  Considered from the distance of time, there is little to justifythe picture.  The I.W.W. were a radical organization, and have to be judged as such.  Their organizers were mostly from Middle West farms: young Americans who had a vision of the working class in chains, and set out to strike off the 
shackles.  Whether the chains existed and right or wrong, they were sincere.  The proof is that some of them suffered martyrdom for their Cause, while many others took terrific punishment from clubs and pick handles; none of them got anything more material in return than a precarious living; and no I.W.W. was ever charged by anyone with selling out to the enemy.<br>

<br>
THE I.W.W. TROUBLE<br>
<br>
Mrs. Nels Olsen, "The IWW Trouble in 1912," <B>The Willapa country history report.</B> Raymond, Washington: Raymond Herald and Advertiser, 1965, p. 70-72.<br>
<br>

<B>Note: </B>There has been so many different variations of this story that the committee felt that it was better not to include it in our history.  Our advisors from the University of Washington said it most certainly should be included as it was a condition that existed in our town.<br>
<br>
The files of the Raymond Herald do not include each issue of the early years so there is nothing there about this trouble.  The South Bend Journal and the Willapa Harbor Pilot had considerable about it in their files.  This account is taken from these two files.  People who lived here during this tense time have said that some of those who had to leave town returned and made fine workers in the mills.<br>
<br>
From the Pilot of March 29, 1912 - "The Industrial Workers of the World, a physical labor force organization, descended upon the city of Raymond last Tuesday morning and by Wednesday noon every sawmill in the city had been closed down.<br>
<br>
"The city is, now under an industrial siege, and martial law has practically been declared.  Every saloon has been closed, and the saloon men are cooperating with the administration and with other business men to preserve order and to protect lives and property from the invasion of the strikers and the agitators who have arrived from Grays Harbor.<br>
<br>
"At a packed mass meeting presided over by J. J. Haggerty, and at which some earnest speeches were made, it was decided to close down the mills temporarily and to swear in every available citizen as a special police officer.  The following committees were named: Ways and Means: Val Heath, Dr. E. R. Perry, M. C. Welsh, Lew Owen, J. J. Shahour; Organization: S.M. Bomber, Chas.  Fuqua, J. T. Stratton, Rev.  W. E. Anderson, Dr. G. W. Overmeyer; Conference: W. A. Ranes, C. I. Henkle, A. C. Little, H. W. MacPhail, and P. W. Culver.<br>
<br>
"On Wednesday afternoon another big meeting was held in the Com-
mercial Club rooms and upwards of 200 more citizens were sworn in as volunteer special policemen.  That night Sheriff Stephens, Deputy Sheriff McDonald and several deputies raided the meeting of strikers and sympathizers in Finn Hall in Raymond, arrested nearly a dozen and locked most of them in the city jail at Raymond, placing an armed guard over the jail.  The meeting hall was nailed up, banners torn down, and a Greek pool hall and grocery store where the Greek strikers and agitators were congregating were closed."
From the Journal of March 29, 1912 - "As a result of a meeting held Monday night in Raymond the Raymond Lumber Company Mill did not start Tuesday morning, because of lack of men and by noon the Willapa Mill was also closed and the Siler Mill running very short handed.<br>
<br>
"The agitators held a meeting in Finn Hall Monday night and speeches were made in several languages.  The hall has since been nailed up -and no meeting has been held since.  Tuesday morning a band of strikers visited the Siler Mill and called out the men and closed the mill.  At the Willapa Mill Deputy Sheriff Baker drove them off the mill property with a revolver but at noon they saw the men and intimidated enough of them to quit so that only half the mill was able to run.<br>
<br>
Mr. Lewis closed the Raymond Lumber Co., as soon as they reached him and the Creech Mill ran short handed.  By noon the Cram Lumber Co., and the Quinault Lumber closed because so Many of the men were afraid to return to work.<br>
<br>
"When it was learned that the mulls were to be closed, down indefinitely a meeting of the business men was called for 8 p.m., Tuesday evening and long before that hour, stores were closed and the crowd began to congregate at the Commercial Club.  It was decided that the mill men, business men and all employees who desired to work should be sworn in as deputy sheriffs to protect property and the working men.<br>
<br>
"By Tuesday night 460 had been sworn in.  The policy is to prevent any gathering of the strikers.  If a man can't explain his business he is ordered out of town.  About a dozen of the agitators are in the city jail charged with inciting a riot or with threats against men who desired to work."<br>
<br>
From the South Bend Journal of April 5, 1912-"By agreement the Raymond Mills blew their whistles on Saturday morning and it was put up to the strikers to go to work or quit the town.<br>
<br>
"The Greeks and Finns were corralled and about 50 Finns shipped out by boat to Nahcotta, whence most of them went to Astoria but a few returned to Raymond Monday morning.  At the same time about 150 Greeks had been herded together and placed in a couple of box cars with a view to paying their fares and shipping them to Centralia but the railroad company declined to take them in box cars and about 50, or all the smoking car would hold, were sent out guarded heavily by deputies.  Sunday morning the rest of them were shipped out.<br>
<br>
"About 200 Raymond citizens armed with shotguns and rifles had been organized into four companies, A, B, C, and D under the generalship of Ed Lowe.  At about 10:30 Saturday morning the Finn and the Greek boarding houses were visited and the idle ones rounded up.  Some of the Finns resisted and one Finn woman drove an officer out of her house with a broom.<br>

"The Greeks took the matter as a joke until they reached the box cars, when some protested and there was soon a perfect babel of voices.  They were packed into the box cars like sardines in a box.<br>
<br>
"When the Greeks reached Centralia Sunday they were met by the Greek Consul, Mr. Hans Heiden of Tacoma, to whom they related a highly colored tale of their treatment and he came back with them. Mr. Lowe had followed the bunch to Centralia and wired back that the Greeks were returning and the afternoon train was met by about 150 of Raymond's citizens headed by A. C. Little.<br>
<br>
What with the previous days of excitement and lack of sleep the crowd was in a fighting mood but the citizens managed, to control themselves.<br>
<br>
"They stopped the train at Willapa and cut out the passenger car in which most of the Greeks were.  Mr. Lowe had crowded them into one car on the pretext that the consul wanted to make them a speech.  Conductor Wentworth refused to move the train until he had instructions from headquarters and went to Raymond on the engine to wire for instructions.  The answer was not to leave any passengers behind, who had paid their fare to Raymond.<br>
<br>
"On a pretext of putting the car which had been cut out on the side track the conductor fooled the crowd by pulling the train clear through and onto the main line before all of the crowd realized what had happened but some jumped aboard and, when the car did reach Raymond they did not permit the Greeks to get out.  They shoved the car back to the county road-crossing by hand and drove the Greeks up the road to Menlo and they were kept in a corral until a special train took them out late that evening.<br>
<br>
"Meanwhile the Greek consul was met by Mr. Little, who displayed some temper and expressed a desire to fight, but everybody was excited and Mr. Little was no exception.  Mr. Heiden was taken to Raymond in an auto and there held a consultation with the mill men, who explained the situation to him. He agreed to the offer made by the mill men to charter a special train which would take the Greeks to Tacoma.<br>
<br>
"Since the excitement has died down the Greeks have discovered that they were getting better wages in Raymond than they can get elsewhere and that they were led into the strike by about 40 of their number who were members of he I.W.W."<br>
<br>
From the Pilot of April 5, 1912 - "Mill men have arranged, to bring in men of family at a higher wage than has been paid to the foreigners.  Ex Mayor A. C. Little, Mayor E. E. Case and citizens of Raymond nipped the  agitation in the bud, but were forced to take heroic measures to rid the city of the I.W.W. crowd."<br>

THE IWW IN 1916<br>
<br>
Vernon H. Jensen, "The IWW in 1916," <B>Lumber and Labor.</B> New York: Farrar and Rinehart, Inc. 1945, p. 122-24.<br>
<br>
In 19I3 the International Union of Shingle Weavers, Sawmill Workers and Woodsmen was formed, with J. G. Brown as president.  In February, 1914, a demand for the eight-hour day, supported by a 
threat of a strike on May <B>1 </B>if the demand was not granted, was vigorously opposed by the employers, who made an aggressive attack on the union and succeeded in operating their mins on an "open-shop basis.<br>
<br>
A number of locals asked the executive board to hold a referendum on the strike question.  In its stead, a special convention was called which decided to try to secure at the Washington polls in November the enactment of the eight-hour initiated measure.  The bill was lost, and the action of the union in threatening a strike and then deciding to trust to political action was the tuming point in the union's history.  The membership began to fall off.  The<br>
<br>
Shingle Weavers had had their fill of attempting to organize the 
lumber workers, and in <B>1916 </B>reorganized themselves on their original basis.  Concurrently, the sawmill and camp workers organized into a new union, the International Union of Sawmill and Timber Workers, with E. E. Wieland as president.<br>
<br>
The dedine of the I.W.W. led to "stocktaking" of its organizing plans and tactics.  The I.W.W. had operated through organizing meetings and the formation of locals in the towns in which the lumber workers congregated when out of work.  It was hoped that the men would become tied to the local and not to the job.  But the isolation of the producing centers and the distances to the camps proved a great disadvantage.<br>
<br>
A new plan of organization was evolved about 1914; it aimed at the establishment of a few permanent central branches, with a secretary in charge and a delegate on each job to sign up members.  The job-delegate system proved effective.  If the "bull o' the woods" got "Wobbly horrors" and fired the delegate, or if the delegate quit, it was easy for the I.W.W. to replace him and continue its work.<br>
<br>

The vigorous campaign during <B>19166 </B>to revive the organization among the lumber workers developed stiff opposition at many places.  A free speech fight at Everett resulted in a bitter tragedy.  The fight followed upon an A.F. of L. Shingle Weavers' strike which 
began on May <B>i, </B>igi6, after a failure of the operators to raise wages voluntarily according to the terms of an agreement made a year before.  A bitter internal quarrel of long standing had kept the union in turmoil.  
Although the term was not then current, "quickie" strikes called by I.W.W. sympathizers within the Shingle Weaver local were of common occurrence.  The operators were so enraged that they would<br>
have  nothing  to  do  with  any  union,  which  meant  a  refusal  to   deal with the A.F- of L. Shingle Weavers.  As the strike wore on, I.W.W. up the town" to leaders decided to secure a hold in Everett to "open up the town,"  union organization.<br>
<br>
The Shingle Weavers, under th leadership of E.  P. Marsh, had encountered obstinate resistance from the employers but had not invited the assistance of the I.W.W. I.W.W. meetings had been frustrated and many members had been arrested and deported to Seattle, which led to the resolve to carry on the free speech fight.<br>
<br>
On October 30, forty-One I.W.W. supporters left Seattle by boat for Everett.  There they were met at the dock by sheriff-led vigilantes.  After being beaten, the men were taken to the outskirts of town, where they were made to run the gantlet between rows of vigilantes who wielded clubs.  Although there were no fatal casualties some of the men were beaten until they were bloody.<br>
<br>
These were the tactics which open-shop leaders up and down the region were advocating to get rid of the unionists.<br>
<br>
A second effort to carry men to Everett in order to assert the union's right to hold meetings was attempted by the I.W.W. when the Verona, with 260 men aboard and accompanied by another vessel carrying 39 men, set out from Seattle on November 5, 1916.<br>
<br>
Sheriff McRae, a former shingle weaver but no longer sympathetic to the union, and bitterly opposed to the I.W.W., received advance from the Pinkerton agency and lined the dock with 200 armed vigilantes.<br>
<br>
When the Verona was made fast McRae demanded that the leaders be pointed out.  This was refused, and upon the sheriff's command ten minutes of shooting followed when the men attempted to disembark, after which the boat backed away<br>
<br>
In addition to the five I.W.W. members and two vigilantes killed, thirty-one I.W.W. members and nineteen vigilantes were wounded.  The I.W.W. contended that all the shooting was done by the vigilantes whose cross fire from three separate groups struck down all the men hit.<br>
<br>
The charge that the men on board the ship had guns was never adequately proven.<br>
<br>
When the boat returned to Seattle all its occupants were placed under arrest by the Police of that city, and seventy-four were held on murder charges.  Feeling ran high.  Mayor Gill courageously
denounced the vigilantes as murderers, ordered improved treatment of the prisoners, and held his position under threat of recall.<br>
<br>
Both the Seattle Labor Council and the State Federation of Labor 
denounced the Everett authorities and urged an <B>locals </B>to give 
support to the I W W. The trial of the first defendant <B>resulted </B>in 
acquittal, after which the other prisoners were <B>released.</B><br>
The I.W.W. also became active and conducted a significant strike in the waning Lake States lumber industry of Minnesota in December, 
<B>1916.  </B>The strike started when the mill men of the Virginia Rainey Lake Company demanded the eight-hour day and a 25-cent increase in daily wages.<br>
<br>
Many lumberjacks in the region, following the example of the sawmill workers, demanded a minimum wage of $40 per month, a nine-hour day, an hour for lunch "to be eaten at camp and not in a snowdrift," paydays every two weeks, and the abolition of the hospital fee.<br>
<br>
One operator ridiculed the demand for a payday every two weeks, remarking that the men "want to be able to draw pay at any time as in the past." This employer found "The demand that the men go to and from work in daylight ... preposterous, and at this time ap-
plicable to no lumber camp.  The men themselves don't ask for it and would never dream of it."<br>
<br>
The lumber industry workers received shabby treatment at the hands of the local authorities.  On the first day of the strike I.W.W. leaflet distributors were arrested, but were released after being warned.  On the following day the local newspaper intimated that the strike was patering out and offered as proof of this fact that "Not a man was arrested last night," which implied that such a development was unusual.<br>
<br>
On January 2 a number of men "of the I.W.W. type" were arrested, although no charge was preferred against them until the following day.<br>
<br>
The guardsmen employed by the operators had, for the most part, had experience on the range the previous summer, and were a tough lot.  Slowly the operators secured men from the camps and operations were gradually resumed because "drastic measures ... [had] been successful in handling the rebels in the woods." It was also reported that the "police are making it uncomfortable" for the I.W.W. Two armed guards were stationed at each camp and it was reported that this "had a wholesome effect." 29 The strike was finally decisively broken but brought about a temporary improvement in wages and living conditions.<br>

IWW. 1917.<br>
<br>
Jack Miller, "IWW Activities in 1917," <B>Solidarity Forever </B><B>Oral History of the IWW.</B> Chicago: Lakeview Press, 1985. p. 112-115.<br>
<br>
There was a conspiracy to stop the IWW even before the United States got into World War I and before there was a Bolshevik Revolution.  The lumber barons were worried.  They thought that if they broke the shingle weavers' strike, they could break other unions.<br>
<br>
The longshoremen had just been defeated after a long strike.  They didn't make any bones about their goal of destroying unions.  Our motto was, "We have nothing to lose but our chains." Look at it this way: when conditions and wages are below subsistence, you lose if you continue to work.  When you only have part-time work offered, it isn't much of a hardship to be on strike.<br>
<br>
Lumberjacks have got to be the most independent of workers.  A lumberjack is a big man with a Paul Bunyan complex.  But between the time of the shooting at Everett on November 5, 1916, and mid-summer of 1917, we organized those lumberacks in Idaho, Oregon, Washington, Northern California, and parts of Montana.<br>
<br>
Some fifty thousand lumberjacks went on strike at the call of the IWW, and there was not one single act of violence.  No one ever crossed the picket lines and no logger remained in a camp where an IWW could reach him to tell him the strike was on.  After that walkout, the timberbeast was on the way out.<br>
<br>
We came up with all kinds of tricks to reach the loggers.  One time we pretended to be tobacco salesmen.  The idea was that every log-
ger chewed regular tobacco, plug tobacco, or Copenhagen.  There was very little smoking.  First, there wouldn't be time to fight up a pipe, and it was dangerous.<br>
<br>
So we got some choice cakes of Plum tobacco, which was the most popular brand, and cut them into small pieces that we wrapped in nice tinfoil.  Our organizer would go into a camp with his tobacco about the time the men were coming in for their meal break.  He would pass out his "samples" and then he'd go into the kitchen and take out the union posters he had brought with him and put them wherever he could.<br>
<br>
He would also go into the bunkhouse and contact anyone he knew had a red card.  We broke into quite a few camps that way.<br>
<br>
Recruitment and direct action remained strong even after the United States entered the war in February of 1917.  The One Big Union was going well in western Canada, and our membership was growing.  Everett had been a terrible legal defeat for the lumber bosses.  
They had thought they could railroad us one after another for being violent.  Now they had to find somthing new.  They began to accuse us of being pro-German and of helping the Kaiser by going on strike.  They charged us with wanting to overthrow the government.<br>
<br>
The profits involved were enormous because a lot of spruce was needed to build airplanes, and contractors were paid at cost plus.  Even though the spruce tree is found wherever timber grows in Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and some parts of Montana, J.aRyan, a big shot in the Milwaukee Railroad who was head of spruce production, thought that production could only be profitably cut on the Olympic Peninsula.<br>
<br>
He built a branch line of the Milwaukee to haul it out.  I think the main reason was that he thought the Loyal Legion of Lumbermen and Loggers would do the work and there would be little contact with the IWW Well, our activities interfered with deals like that, so they had to have the government come in.  They drafted people into the Spruce Division, and they supported the 4-Ls, which they had formed in the first place.<br>
<br>
What hurt us the most was the defense trials they kept putting us through.  We had to continuously raise money for the trials instead of organizing.  The Mesabi Iron Range flared up again and we couldn't respond efficiently, because we had to keep the organization going.<br>
<br>
I have often been asked if the sacrifice of the five known dead at Everett and all the beatings, jailings, and other outrages were worth it.  My answer is "yes." The depth of principle in the IWW was just incredible.  One time an escaped parolee from Pennsylvania was offered the remission of his time if he would be a prosecution witness against the IWW.  He refused.  When they came to take him back, we tried to cheer him up by singing.  That was such an emotional moment.  To think that a man would be willing to sacrifice five or six years in prison rather than forsake his ideals.<br>

Hugh I. Lovin, "The Red Scare in Idaho, 1916-1918," <B>Idaho Yesterdays.</B> XVII (Fall, 1973), p. 2-13.<br>
<B><br>
<br>
</B>Reds and Huns gained tremendous unpopularity during an intense wartime excitement which found expression in events such as burning the Kaiser in effigy at Challis on armistice day in 1918.  Professor Lovin, of the department of history at Boise State University, recaptures the spirit of that tumult in explaining the situation that led to Idaho's red scare.<br>
<br>
In 1915, the economy of Idaho began to recover from the recession which I had beset the state for several years.  In 1916, prices of agricultural goods rose, and Idaho farmers looked forward to better times.  Industry anticipated spiraling profits and accordingly undertook to expand its productive capacity.  The Bunker Hill and Sullivan Company constructed a multi-million dollar smelter at Wallace.<br>
<br>
The Boise-Payette Lumber Company erected a new mill at Emmett that required 500 men for full operation of the plant.  The Oregon Short Line scheduled major improvements, among them a new roundhouse, turntable and repair shops at Nampa and significant upgrading of the railroad's facilities at Pocatello.<br>
<br>
Despite the return of prosperity, many Idahoans were restive.  In particular, they looked askance at the forces of radicalism and<br>
organized labor, fearing that both might resort to industrial turmoil ruinous to the great prosperity that appeared within reach.<br>
<br>
The Idaho Socialist Party, small in membership but persistent and innovative, seemed capable of provoking at least some industrial unrest.  Wobblies - members of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) loomed more menacing to the commonwealth.  Perhaps they were mischievous enough to trigger  major labor-management  confrontations.<br>
<br>
Scarcely less troublesome, in the eyes of some Idahoans, were the railroad brotherhoods and the unions of the American Federation of Labor (AFL), which possessed sufficient clout in Idaho to win some of their strikes.  Moreover, the latter groups established their credit with the Idaho Democratic Party, and the incumbent "Bourbon" administration of Governor Moses Alexander, his critics said, was too sensitive to the demands of the latter <B>groups.</B><br>
<br>
The Idaho Socialist Party had, since 1902, regularly presented slates of candidates for state elective offices.  Equally regularly, its candidates fared badly at the polls.' The party, however, seemed unlikely to wither and disappear.  It maintained an energetic local
in Kootenai County and a following in most of the other counties of the Idaho panhandle.<br>
<br>
In southern Idaho, the party had a strong local in Minidoka County, built <B>by</B> thundering against the "trusts" and by capitalizing on farmer resentment against United States reclamation authorities.  In 1914 and again in 1916, the Minidoka County Socialist candidates for state offices polled between 7000 and 8000 votes each in the general elections of 1914 and 1916 Socialists elected two of their members to county offices.<br>
<br>
Elsewhere in southern Idaho, the Socialists established themselves in the Boise valley and located the party's state headquarters at Nampa.  They claimed a major coup in 1914 when Earl Bowman, a journalist and political maverick, won election to the Idaho State Senate on the Socialist tickets In south eastern Idaho, a Socialist local was established at Pocatello.<br>
<br>
It ran candidates for municipal offices in the 1917 city elections. While few Idahoans quaked on account of occasional Socialist victories at the <B>polls,</B> many became increasingly impatient with Socialist propaganda.  Anti-capitalist rhetoric was presented.  More important, responsible critics accused the Socialists of stirring up class feeling, fostering hatred and divisions in Idaho, and helping to promote industrial Unrest.<br>
<br>
For instance, Joe DeWitt (a Rupert newspaper publisher) reported that Luella Twining - a Socialist "Lyceum" spellbinder billed by the Rupert Socialist local as "the Joan of Arc of the working class" - had, indeed, furthered divisiveness at Rupert.<br>
<br>
DeWitt said she convinced her audiences "that there did exist a class struggle" in America and, furthermore,  "the  socialists  did  not  make [it]..."<br>
<br>
A Sandpoint editor assailed the Idaho Socialist Party's 1916 "program" for 'the industrial emancipation of man." The program, he said, erroneously imputed Eastern industrial developments and conflicts to Idaho and then applied Socialist nostrums to matters that were irrelevant to Idaho conditions."'<br>
<br>
In 1916, Socialists further stretched the patience of Idahoans.  Socialists denounced those who advocated preparedness for war.  They disseminated anti-war propaganda and brought to Idaho a parade of Socialist speakers who orated against war and militarism.  George Kirkpatrick (author of War, What For?) and Emil Siedel (a former Socialist mayor of Milwaukee) were among the Socialist warhorses sent to agitate in Idaho against war.<br>
<br>
Nationally, the Socialist anti-war campaign focused frequently on opposition to Woodrow Wilson's intervention in Mexico in 1916. 
Idaho Socialists cooperated and tried to impede the "war" in<br>
Mexico by discouraging enlistments in the Idaho National Guard when the unit was mobilized for service on the Mexican border.<br>
<br>
Although Idahoans expressed fear of Socialist-fomented discord in the state, the IWW more immediately threatened Idaho agriculture and industry with unwanted troubles.  In 1915, the IWW chartered an Agricultural Workers Organization and announced plans for industrial unions among lumber industry workmen in the Pacific Northwest.<br>
<br>
The IWW organizational drive began in western Washington and Oregon.  IWW activity resulted in considerable turmoil, notably in raucous "free speech fights" when public authorities tried to curb the IWW.  Next, the IWW targeted the inland lumbering regions; early in 1917, it chartered the Lumber Workers Industrial Union with headquarters at Spokane.<br>
<br>
The union announced a set of demands that industry considered intolerable: the 8 - hour day; higher wages; major improvements in logging camp living conditions.<br>
<br>
In 1916, the IWW and the lumber industry skirmished in Idaho.  The IWW opened an office at St. Maries; IWW organizers fanned out to the logging camps.  Lumber industrialists, aghast at the IWW intrusions accused the Wobbly organizers of achieving fast results by "gun tactics." In July, 1916, the IWW fomented an ineffectual week-long strike in the woods near Coeur d'Alene.<br>
<br>
IWW organizers persevered and increased their following through the summer and autumn of 1916.  In December, IWW officials crowed that the IWW was  "favorably" established in the logging camps around St. Maries and Bonners Ferry that demands for higher wages, shorter hours and improved working conditions could again be asserted.<br>
<br>
The threat of labor trouble soon materialized.  In December,  loggers went on strike at Bovill against the Potlatch Lumber Company.  In January, 1917, loggers struck at Alder Creek and then at Fernwood.  In February, two strikes erupted near Coeur d'Alene.<br>
<br>
Lumber industry entrepreneurs replied by flooding North Idaho Chambers of Commerce and other organizations with for support in curbing the Wob preventing anarchy, and ensuring the lumber industry against curtailment.  Idahoans who feared labor turmoil at the hands of radicals now had their worst fears confirmed.<br>
<br>
While Wobbly-led strikes were erupting, AFL unions and employers clashed over similar wages-and-hours issues.  AFL craft unions were, by 1915, organized at Lewiston and the larger towns in southern Idaho.  At Lewiston, Boise, and Pocatello, AFL unionists created central labor union councils, and the Boise and Pocatello unionists sparked a movement that led to establishing the Idaho State Federation of Labor." The AFL unions demanded higher wages and the
8-hour day. The State Federation additionally pressed for workmen's  compensation legislation and abolition of poll taxes. Employers  resisted AFL union demands. Several confrontations ensued.<br>
<br>
The Typographical Union, backed by the Boise Trades and Labor Council, feuded with Caxton Printers at Caldwell and the publishers of the Nampa Leader-Herald and finally placed both establishments on the "unfair list." Pocatello carpenters struck and forced one employer to pay three dollars' wages for eight hours of work.  The Pocatello Building Trades Council battled with construction<br>
contractors.  Several of the contractors refused to bargain and, according to the unionists, one employer told Council representatives that he "knew how to run his own business and could get plenty of 'rats' or non union men to do his work."<br>
<br>
The contractors, united in an association called the Builders Exchange, won the first skirmishes, but the unionists prevailed a few months later.  The Building Trades Council led a strike against members of the Builders Exchange.  In the end, the latter agreed to union wage demands and to employ only union labor.  Trade, Council leaders rejoiced, claiming long strides toward imposing the "closed shop" at Pocatello.  ' '<br>
<br>
South Idahoans grudgingly tolerated the AFL unions, but their patience with labor discord wore exceedingly thin.  Labor mostly exhausted that tolerance in August, 1916, when the railroad brotherhoods threatened a nationwide strike to begin on Labor Day, 1916.  The impending rail strike thoroughly angered many.  A lengthy strike would subject townsmen, dependent on railroads for delivery of their coal supplies, to deprivation when cold weather began.<br>
<br>
Farmers and stock growers snorted with indignation. A strike would make it impossible to market their fat lambs and cattle as well as the fruit and grain crops.  Newspapers fanned the anger.<br>
<br>
A Boise newspaper calculated that sheep men stood to lose $500,000 on the half-million Idaho lambs that could not reach eastern markets before the strike deadline.  A farmers' journal warned its readers of heavy losses unless railroads were compelled to pay "just compensation" to their employees and labor, in turn, ceased "making unreasonable and arbitrary demands."'<br>
<br>
At the eleventh hour, Congress averted a rail strike by passing the Adamson Act, which instituted the 8-hour day and overtime pay for railroad employees.  In Idaho, relieved townsmen ceased fretting about wintertime deprivation; agrarians relaxed into their accustomed autumn routines of gathering the livestock from the ranges, harvesting the crops, and badgering the railroads for sufficient cars to haul away the plenty of Idaho agriculture.  However, controversy in Idaho about industrial wages, the 8-hour day, and labor extremism had merely begun.<br>
<br>
In the election campaigns of 1916, Idaho Republicans belabored the
Adamson Act and accused Woodrow Wilson and Democratic lawmakers of beating a hasty retreat when labor raised its mailed fist.  William E. Borah told a Boise audience that Congress passed the w "in a fit of abject political cowardice." Senator James Brady denounced the Adamson Act as "legislative buncombe" which awarded "10 hours pay for 8 hours work" to "one class of laboring men."<br>
<br>
Guy Martin, sometime leader of the Idaho Bull Moosers who had finally abandoned insurgency, reminded Idahoans that granting labor's wage and hours demands would prove costly to consumers' pocketbooks.'<br>
<br>
Idaho Democrats defended the Adamson Act; some (for example, the entire Democratic "legislative slate" in Bannock County) announced in favor of legislation establishing the 8-hour day in Idaho.  Labor unions responded by endorsing Moses Alexander as the man who "stood by the workers" and working for the election of friendly Democrats to the state legislature.<br>
<br>
Some of the Republicans ignored the union support that Democrats were garnering; others, towards the end of the campaign, toned down their anti-labor remarks.  D. W. Davis, the Republican gubernatorial nominee, attempted to focus the ..Republicans' campaign on the "vaudeville" and "burlesque" that Alexander had allegedly injected into his administration of state affairs.<br>
<br>
Alexander prevailed in the election, defeating Davis by a narrow margin of 63,877 to 63,305 votes.  Democrats won five Statehouse offices; Republicans captured three.  Democrats won small majorities in both houses of the legislature .<br>
<br>
Subsequent to the 1916 election, Idahoans persisted in grumbling against radicals and extremist laborites.  The Adamson Act because of its 8-hour-day and overtime pay provisos, remained an infuriating symbol of labor radicalism to numerous persons.  One journal excoriated the Adamson law and accused labor unions of "To Hell With The People" attitudes .<br>
<br>
The legislature convened in January, 1917.  The State Federation of Labox pressured legislators for a statute providing an 8-hour day for women and for a comprehensive workmen's compensation law.  Both proposals encountered resistance; the compensation legislation proved notably controversial.<br>
<br>
Labor's proposal - the so-called Bates Bill ran afoul of opposition from the insurance and mining industries, whereupon the legislators refused to enact it.  Opponents of the Bates Bill called it "radical," objected to a state monopoly on industrial insurance," and said that it was "socialism" and un-American."<br>
<br>

North Idaho legislators, meanwhile, insisted that the legislature deal with the more urgent problem, in their opinion, of "revolutionary industrial unionism" and Wobbly sabotage in the Idaho panhandle.  The Wobblies they complained, first fomented strikes and more recently resorted to devious and potentially more damaging tactics, among them setting fires in the woods and driving metal spikes into logs in order to cripple sawmill machinery.<br>
<br>
Industrial discord in the lumber industry, in  the view of these legislators, had reached intolerable limits.  Furthermore, the turmoil might spread to the mines and smelters in the Coeur d'Alenes.  Predictions of trouble in the Coeur d'Alenes were accurate.  In March, 375 miners struck at Wallace.<br>
<br>
The legislature soon received a package of bills ostensibly aimed at the IWW.  Several of the bills, however, were patently anti -labor measures that would cripple all labor union activity.  The package included bills prohibiting industrial sabotage, strikes, and picketing and, unique in the United States, a criminal syndicalism bill which punished both advocacy and use of violence to achieve<br>
"industrial or political reform.  "<br>
<br>
The legislature dallied with the proposals for the part of a month.  By that time, war between the United States and Germany seemed probable.  The legislature voted to repress the radicals.  Anti-sabotage and criminal syndicalism bills were approved by overwhelming majorities.  A third bill, punishing persons who incited crime, passed despite considerable opposition.<br>
<br>
After the United States went to war with Germany in April, 1917, Idahoans immediately expected the worst from the groups that had distressed so many citizens during the last couple of years. Agrarians and county officials flooded the offices of Governor Alexander and the Idaho congressional delegation with demands for troops to protect irrigation reservoirs and grain elevators.<br>
<br>
The Oregon Short Line and utility companies asked for guards.  North Idaho mine and smelter operators first by-passed state authorities and applied directly to the United States War Department for federal bayonets to ensure no disruptions in the mines and smelters of the Coeur d'Alenes.  That request denied, they demanded that the state supply guards.<br>
<br>
Apprehensive industrialists, edgy businessmen, and fearful agrarians alike urged deployment of the Idaho National Guard (federalized in March, 1917, and remained in the state until August) to protect their properties.  The State Council of Defense for the most part supported those requests.<br>
<br>
It urged Governor Alexander to secure federal troops for guarding reservoirs, railroads, and electric power plants.  The recommended
that municipal companies of Home Guards to protect facilities for which federal protection was not provided. Alexander ignored the Council's recommendation.  Unsympathetic to most requests for troops to stand watch over private property, Alexander merely asked the War Department for troops to guard state property and for additional forces in the event of an "emergency."The War Department denied Alexander's requests.<br>
<br>
Later in 1917, however, two small detachments of federal troops were briefly assigned to service in the Idaho panhandle<br>
during strikes.<br>
<br>
In August the War Department removed the Idaho National Guardsmen from the state, leaving the duty of protection up to state and municipal authorities. Alexander saw little peril, confident that local law enforcement officials were capable of coping with trouble.<br>
<br>
Edgy citizens, abetted by industrialists and some state officials who believed Alexander too sanguine about the dangers of radicalism within Idaho, contended otherwise.  Clamor arose for poised bayonets on station in Idaho, ready for immediate service at the first hint of disorder.  When that military might did not materialize, nervous citizens formed an array of protective associations, home defense leagues, and home guard companies.<br>
<br>
From June to September, 1917, labor troubles beset the panhandle.  In June, striking loggers brought many logging and a few sawmill operations to a standstill.  The strikers demanded the 8-hour day, wage increases, and logging camp improvements.   Lumber company spokesmen replied that such demands were unreasonable, blamed the IWW for the strikes, and claimed that IWW threats and sometimes violence had coerced most of the loggers into striking. Elsewhere, a brief strike by fire fighters erupted; as some of the strikers were Wobblies, the forest fires were widely believed to be "incendiary" deeds by the IWW.<br>
<br>
In August, a miners' strike occurred at Burke.  Mine operators and some of the local labor unionists accused Wobblies from  Bisbee,  Arizona, and Butte of triggering the outbreak and employed   "incendiary" fires.<br>
<br>
The strikes in the panhandle were short-lived.  County sheriffs, at Alexanders instructions, broke the lumber strike by interning many Wobblies and their sympathizers.  The other strikers prudently chose silence and returned to work in the woods and sawmills.  County prosecuting attorneys invoked the criminal syndicalism and anti-sabotage statutes against some of the internees.<br>
<br>
In the Coeur d'Alenes, mediation ended the miners' strike quickly.  Mine managements won maintenance of the open-shop    principle"   
but agreed not to discriminate against non-IWW unionists."<br>
<br>
Despite the strike settlements in North Idaho, Idahoans generally refused to consider the IWW any less threatening.  In the view of many, the cessation of industrial disorders in the panhandle could not be allowed to obscure the alien and disloyal "influences" that allegedly guided the IWW.<br>
<br>
Newspapers and some state officials confirmed that view; often the German "influence" in the IWW was stressed.  Others considered Wobblies merely the advance agents of Russian bolshevikism, since the IWW advocated the elimination of private property "just as the bolsheviki of Russia propose to do."'<br>
<br>
Although southern Idaho experienced little labor trouble during the war years, the IWW's repute as the provoker of strife in the panhandle and its alleged political disloyalty ensured the IWW ample distrust in the south.<br>
<br>
More important, the IWW opened a "headquarters" at Pocatello; IWW organizers attempted to build a following among Boise-Payette Lumber Company employees; IWW organizers were caught distributing literature at Rupert and allegedly did so at Nampa, Twin Falls, and other towns along the Snake River.<br>
<br>
Once the IWW attempted, for the most part unsuccessfully, to establish a foothold in southern Idaho, an outcry against the IWW "menace" arose in the southern end of the state.  The press warned farmers of peril if itinerant IWW farm hands were to destroy crops; extortionate wage demands.  A Cascade "citizens' committee" hustled "IWW delegates" out of town aboard the first train.<br>
<br>
The Dairy Association, after hearing speeches in which the IWW and "bolsheviki" were equated, resolved to "repress disloyalty."" In 1918, many towns posted notices warning "slackers, I.W.W.'s and loafers" to "BEAT IT." Sometimes the bans were enforced.  A police round-up of violators at Caldwell, for example, yielded no self-admitted Wobblies but two cases of aggravated laziness were found it was [also] found necessary to advise several others, mildly afflicted, that no one but workers are wanted in Caldwell.<br>
<br>
The two extremists were given 30 minutes to get out of town.  They beat the limit by 23 minutes.<br>
<br>
Idaho Socialists, too, became the object of public wrath in 1917 because the IWW and the Socialist Party were increasingly regarded as birds of a feather.  The Idaho Socialist Party tried, to little avail, to escape the anti-IWW animus.  In July, it officially disclaimed sympathy with IWW activities in connection with  the  strikes in the panhandle.    The disclaimer convinced few. 
Socialists soon were accused of cooperating with the IWW to promote industrial unrest <B>in </B>Idaho.<br>
<br>
In Clearwater County, newspapers warned that the "nest" of Socialists "on the lower stretch of Elk Creek" sympathized with the IWW and that Socialist leaders advocated IWW "principles and policies." Several Elk Creek Socialists were arrested and charged with criminal syndicalism.  John Ellis, a country storekeeper and frequent Socialist candidate for public office in the county, ultimately was convicted and imprisoned on evidence that the county prosecuting attorney privately admitted was meager."'<br>
<br>
At Lewiston, where Socialists held several offices in the Lewiston Trades and Labor Council, suspicion ran high that the radical labor unionists sympathized with the IWW and additionally were guilty, as charged by federal authorities, of obstructing the war effort.  In Minidoka County, Sheriff Hiram Thompson closely watched the local Socialists; finally, he nabbed several persons and charged them with possession and distribution of IWW and other  "seditious" literature.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, Idaho Socialists antagonized many with anti-war propaganda and by fighting conscription of men into the United States armed forces.  Although Idaho Socialists bickered among themselves about supporting the war against Germany, the anti-war faction dominated the party's affairs.  The latter launched, the party on a course of openly denouncing the war and resisting conscription.<br>
<br>
Idaho Socialists delivered numerous anti-war speeches; for instance, A.V. Werden (sometime Socialist candidate for Mayor of Pocatello) told one group that he "would not go to war, would oppose it" and had posted a "Thou shalt not kill" sign in his office."<br>
<br>
The Idaho Socialist journal, The Party Builder, published anti-war commentary, whereupon postal authorities banned it from the mails.  Anti-conscription petitions were circulated at Pocatello.  A Caldwell youth, the son of Socialist parents, refused to register for the draft but relented when faced with prosecution.<br>
<br>
The Price We Pay and other anti-war pamphlets were distributed in Boise.  At Rupert, the press reported, "raging, ranting, exasperating people" slandered the government,   resisted    conscription of their sons and discouraged enlistments of others<br>
into the armed forces.  A near riot occurred when a war opponent unfurled a banner, inscribed "Thou Shalt Not Kill," at a Nampa<br>
"patriotic" assembly.<br>
<br>
The Socialists battle against conscription in Idaho was also waged in the courts.  Edward Hofstede - an Orofino lawyer who denied membership in the Socialist Party but admitted to Socialist sympathies - publicly opposed conscription.  Hofstede advised his clients, several of whom refused to register for the draft, that federal conscription laws violated the Thirteenth Amendment to the
United States Constitution.  Accused of counseling draft evasion, Hofstede stood trial at Moscow and was found guilty.  The residing judge, in passing sentence on Hofstede, upheld federal conscription laws and ruled that "unreasonable criticism of the government and its operations was not permissible.<br>
<br>
Idaho Socialists, too, secured help from outside the state in their fight against war and conscription.  Kate Richards O'Hare, formerly national secretary of the Socialist Party, came to Nampa and delivered an anti-,war speech at a Socialist "encampment" at :nearby Lake Lowell.  James Mauxer (nationally prominent Socialist and President of the Pennsylvania State Federation of Labor) spoke against war and conscription at Pocatello until the city police cut short his speech.  John DeQuer - in peacetime, a star on the Socialist lyceum circuit - lectured at Rupert.<br>
<br>
This "most annoying and obtrusive agitator," however, was not permitted to finish his address.  The county sheriff arrested him.<br>
The Socialists' anti-war campaign produced loud demands in Idaho for a crackdown on Socialist "agitation." The Idaho Statesman, Boise's leading newspaper, speculated on May 27, 1917, that at least "several hundred" opponents of way were at work at Nampa and environs.<br>
<br>
The Pocatello Commercial Club passed resolutions against "agitators" and their "treasonable and seditious conduct." The club appointed itself to investigate those "sinister forces." A tempest erupted at Rupert.  Rupert citizens complained about Socialist activities in their midst and finally struck back at the local Socialists.  They petitioned Governor Moses Alexander to remove a Socialist, C. H. Burgher, from the local draft exemption board.<br>
<br>
Burgher allegedly had said, "War is legalized murder." Burgher's allies retorted that the accusations were "political spite work" and collected depositions and signatures on petitions favorable to Burgher.  Alexander refused to remove Burgher from office.<br>
<br>
In August, 1917, the People's Council of America for Peace and Democracy established a chapter at Nampa and tried to organize chapters at Lewiston, Caldwell, and Twin Falls. The Council, an example of classic Marxist " front organization" tactics, outwardly was pacifist.  However, anti-war Socialists captured control of it whereupon admiration of Russian Bolsheviks and proposals for a negotiated peace with Germany became the main staples of the Council's propaganda.<br>
<br>
Strident resistance to the Council arose in Idaho.  Newspapers and citizens' groups demanded suppression of the "Hohenzollern Peace Doves" and an immediate end to Socialist "agitation" in the state.<br>
Those who proposed repression of Socialists anticipated  little help from the state in view of Governor Alexander's action in the Burgher case.  Municipal authorities, on the other hand, proved more cooperative.<br>

The Mayor of Caldwell banned a meeting called to launch a chapter of the People's Council; the Caldwell police allowed townsmen to drown out with "honking" automobile horns a Socialist curbstone orator who attempted to promote the People's Council.  Elsewhere, over 100 persons petitioned the Nampa City Council for suppression of the radicals "before the seed of sedition is sown." The Pocatello City Council was asked to deny their streets" to "crackerbox orators."<br>
<br>
The Nampa and Pocatello councils promptly complied by passing ordinances which either totally forbade street assembly or permitted public assemblies only with the city's consent.  Other town councils followed suit.  In the end, the new municipal ordinances generally were enforced and succeeded in stifling much of the anti-war "agitation" to which so many Idahoans objected.<br>
<br>
The battle against "socialism" in Idaho flared up on another front as well.  In 1917, William Scholtz and Ray McKaig organized the Idaho Non-Partisan League (INPL).  Scholtz formerly headed the Idaho state farm marketing agency; McKaig was an official of the North Dakota Non-Partisan League.<br>
<br>
Scholtz and McKaig achieved quick success by sending a corps of organizers, ultimately about forty persons, to "jitney" through the countryside and enroll farmers in the INPL.  By August, 1917, according to Scholtz, about 4,000 had enrolled, mainly in the Boise valley, in Minidoka and Twin Falls counties, and in some areas in the southeastern corner of the state.<br>
<br>
Willard Deal, Master of the Idaho State Grange and a supporter of the INPL, more conservatively estimated the number 2,800. Scholtz claimed that his organizers attracted the most recruits among farmers who, having found no salvation in Populism or Progressivism, looked to the INPL to lead agrarians to the "granary of plenty."<br>
<br>
INPL leaders achieved rapport with many Grange and Farmers' Union officials.  Several of the latter accepted seats on the INPL executive committee.  That courtship paid dividends for the INPL.<br>
<br>
The Idaho State Federation of Agriculture, in 1918, endorsed the INPL and warmly applauded the INPL's advocacy of public ownership of electrical power sites and facilities.  The Idaho State Grange annual convention of 1918 voted "hearty approval of the program of the Non-Partisan League."<br>
<br>
The INPL adhered closely to the program of its parent body in North Dakota: state-owned elevators, warehouses, and other facilities that processed farm products; state ownership of electrical generating and distributing systems; State-owned rural credit banks.  INPL  rhetoric focused sharply on corporate evils machinations of the "Power Trust," of which Idaho Power Company was a major whipping boy; "trusts" that processed farm goods and shortchanged farmers; large corporations that, NPL spokesmen claimed, war profiteered and simultaneously escaped high wartime taxation.  The League advertised:
Why all the squealing against the League? Big business porkers are stuck! They Squeal.<br>
<br>
The program and rhetoric of the INPL quickly proved offensive.  To many, it sounded remarkably similar to Socialist and Wobbly "agitation" which Idahoans had firmly rejected.  Wobbly and NPL rhetoric seemed essentially alike sin both groups aimed their fire at the san nemesis, the industrial titans.  On the surface the Socialist Party and the INPL appeared ideologically to share the same collectivist goals, and most Idahoans were in no mood to make distinctions between radical groups.<br>
<br>
Consequently, opponents of the INPL accused it of the same evils that earlier were attributed to the IWW and th(@ Idaho Socialist Party: stirring "strife" between social classes; fostering "class legislation"; making alliances with other radicals in order to control the government; offering political haven to a variety of pro-Germans and labor disrupter who shared predilections for "industrial" strife.<br>
<br>
The INPL's critics, moreover, compared the INPL and the "Bolsheviki" favorably. "Our Northwest Bolsheviki," Edwin Barber (a Shoshone publisher) said, sought to "separate the American people into warring classes" as had happened in Russia.  The Phil Sheridan Post (Boise) of the Grand Army of the Republic voted a resolution which stated "no Bolshevikism will be allowed in our country.<br>
<br>
A "Patriotic League," organized at Twin Falls to resist the INPL, announced it was combatting the INPL's "socialistic program of state communism"; furthermore, it accused the Non-Partisans of trying to create in the United States the same revolutionary conditions developed in Russia by the Bolsheviki.<br>
<br>
In conservative eyes, the INPL's socialism" so menaced the commonwealth that repression was in order.  The North Idaho Press Association twice warned citizens to shun the INPL.  At Shoshone, townsmen refused to rent facilities to the Non-Partisans for meetings, forcing the League to hold street assemblies.<br>
<br>
Anti-INPL elements at Salmon and Twin Falls demanded that the county Councils of Defense subject "disloyal farmers to harsher examinations and stern punishments for disloyalty."<br>
<br>
Elsewhere, serious consideration was given to proposals for silencing the INPL by preventing INPL speakers (especially A. C. Townley, founder of the NPL in North Dakota) from talking publicly.  The State Council of Defense adopted a report which characterized Townley's "utterances" as not "rebounding] to the credit of the state or to the patriotism of the citizenship of Idaho."'<br>
<br>
Councils of Defense in nine panhandle counties discussed curbs on INPL speakers; three of the councils finally agreed to oppose any further addresses in Idaho from Townley.  The Ada County Council of Defense prevented Townley from speaking once but, in a second
incident, the Ada County sheriff intervened on Townley's behalf.  Townley spoke at Boise.<br>
<br>
The INPL fought back.  It countered charges of disloyalty by holding "patriotic" meetings, collecting money for the Red Cross, and asking INPL members to purchase Liberty bonds.  INPL spokesmen denied collusion between the INPL and the IWW, and connections between the two groups were never demonstrated.  However, the INPL failed to shed the "socialist" label.<br>
<br>
Reference to public records quickly proved that Townley and other national leaders of the League had, indeed, earlier run for public office in the Middle West on Socialist tickets.  Old-line Idaho Socialists flocked into the INPL; for instance, in Minidoka County the Non-Partisans' nominees in 1918 for county elective offices   included six "known"<br>
<br>
Socialists out of the nine nominees   on    the ticket. More    damaging    to    the    INPL, The Appeal to Reason and other Socialist papers published pleas to Socialists to <B>rush </B>to the aid of the Non-Partisans in Idaho and several other states.  Opponents of the INPL scrutinized its organizational staff and shortly<br>
exposed several instances of Socialist organizers employed by the League in Idaho.<br>
<br>
From July to November of 1918, the furor over "socialism" disrupted Idaho politics.  Instead of forming their own political party, the Non-Partisans filed a slate of candidates on the Democratic ticket in the primaries.  The Non-Partisans won most of the contests; thus, they succeeded in temporarily capturing control of the Idaho Democratic Party.<br>
<br>
The INPL, meanwhile, claimed it was genuinely non-partisan"  by  endorsing   William   E.   Borah and several other Republican candidates.<br>
The "simon pure" faction of the Democratic Party resisted the Non-Partisan invasion.  They heaped a barrage of abuse on the INPL, calling it "radical socialist," <B>"IWW," </B>and "pro-German" among other epithets. Their resistance was to no avail.<br>
<br>
In the Idaho Republican Camp, Senator Borah urged Republicans tc avoid giving offense to agrarians by accusing the INPL of disloyalty and radicalism.  In varying degrees, many Republicans ignored Borah's counsel, and some heavily campaigned against "socialism" and "bolshevikism" in Idaho.<br>
<br>
Republican  senatorial    nominee Frank Gooding, for example, employed slogans such as "Keep the State Clean of Socialism and the IWW." A vote for Gooding advertisement read, "The fight is on against the plan of a nonpartisan league to set up a bolshevistic government in Idaho.
In most instances, Republican candidates triumphed in the November elections.  The Republicans won control of the state government.  The tactics of the Non-Partisans clearly helped to ensure that outcome.  Moreover, two years of ever-growing hostility in Idaho toward radicals undoubtedly influenced the electorate against those tagged in 1918 with the onus of socialism.<br>
<br>
The distaste of Idahoans for labor-industry warfare, too, likely prejudiced electors in favor of Republican candidates inasmuch as Non-Partisans publicly boasted during the campaign of their labor union allies and their "farmer-labor slate" of nominees.  More important perhaps, the electorate in 1918 probably reacted adversely to more than the INPL's agrarian radicalism.  The INPL professed to have created a "farmer-labor" political coalition in Idaho; moreover, it thundered mightily against Big Business.  To voters, this may well have seemed a portent, incredibly near realization, of the class conflict for which the IWW and the Idaho Socialist Party had long been feared.<br>
<br>
In the end, Idaho's Red Scare of 1916-1918 produced numerous casualties.  Idaho's record of repressive measures against radicals was not one that could ever win the applause of civil libertarians.  On the other hand, suppressions of radicals in Idaho differed markedly from similar enterprises in a number of sister states.<br>
<br>
The Idaho Red Scare of 1916-1918 produced remarkably little violence and no loss of life.  "Cameron dam tactics" in dealing with radicals, to quote <B>I  </B>R. Crow (an Orofino newspaper publisher), were not acceptable in Idaho although such measures enjoyed a certain vogue elsewhere.<br>
<br>
In the case of the Non-Partisans, Idahoans for  the most part merely resorted to bruising but comparatively harmless epithet-hurling  and then dealt with radicalism at the ballot box.<br>

CENTRALIA MURDERS AROUSE TACOMA<br>
<br>
The first Armistice Day, November llth, was duly and appropriately observed in Tacoma.  But events which transpired in the neighboring town of Centralia that day created more commotion in Pierce County than anything that had happened for some time; resulted in many arrests and criminal prosecutions in the county; and created deep resentment and bitter criticism of all radicals and members of the I.  W. W. That event was the murders of Lieut.  Warren Grimm, Dale Hubbard, Arthur Macelfresh'and Ben Cassagranda and the wounding of three other ex-service men as they paraded in Centralia, by alleged I. W. W. members.  One of the men accused of the dastardly crime, "Red" Smith, was lynched following the shooting.<br>
<br>
Authorities and citizens in Tacoma, upon learning of the facts, met to express their condemnation of the crime and to start action looking to the rounding up of local radicals.  Spanish war veterans and American Legion members held a mass meeting at the Commercial Club rooms at I o'clock on the 12th.  Another mass meeting was held on the evening of the 13th.<br>
<br>
Local newspapers stated that "Tacoma will be too warm hereafter for the I. W. W." Attention was called to the fact that fourteen radical papers were on sale at the International Labor News Stand, at 1407 Pacific Avenue.  On November 15th ninety alleged members of the I. W. W. in Tacoma and Centralia were charged in court with a "conspiracy to overthrow the government," a special agent of the department of justice swearing to the complaints.  On the 17th sixty-six alleged I.W. W. members were arraigned before Superior Judge           M.     L. Clifford, on a charge of criminal syndicalism.<br>
<br>
During the latter part of the month twenty-two of the prisoners held in the city jail went on a hunger strike.  After refusing food f or about 120 hours, or a full five days, they called the fast to an end on Tuesday noon, December 2nd.  During the month of December the I. W. W. organization appealed through the mails to Pierce County laborers and union meni as well as over the entire Northwest, for contributions to the defense fund of the men in jail at Centralia and Tacoma.  Their circulars solicited the funds on a plea for "free speech, free assemblage and free press."<br>
<br>
     
STRIKE AT SHIPYARDS<br>
<br>
On January 20, thousands of Tacoma shipyard workers laid down their tools and went out on a strike.  The strike committee was in session all day, and they announced that it was not a sympathetic move following the Seattle vote of some three days previous; but that it was based upon wage demands made the previous August.  Four Tacoma yards and nine contract shops employing metal workers were affected at first.  The machinists employed in the municipal machine shops walked out in sympathy.<br>
<br>
On January 25 George P. Wright, president of the Wright shipyards, received a telegram from Charles Pietz, general manager of the Emergency Fleet Corporation, asking the Wright company not to resume operations unless the strikers were willing to work under the labor adjustment board's decision, and added that the "Fleet Corporation stands by the Marcy award and will do nothing more." The shipwrights at Todd's, numbering some two hundred, were drawn into the strike on January 27.  Sheet metal men, involving about 100, also struck on that day.<br>
<br>
On February 3 various unions in Tacoma took a vote on a general strike.  The unions which voted in favor of a general strike were the butchers, the timberworkers, the auto mechanics, electricians (inside wiring), bakers, and plumbers.  Those which opposed such a move, as shown by the vote, were the street railway employees, the municipal employees, moving picture operators, teamsters and chauf-
feurs, carpenters and retail clerks.<br>
<br>
The plasterers cast a favorable vote to assist the general strike; while the power and light men, tailors, typographical union, cooks and waiters, laundry workers, meat cutters and barbers voted to give no assistance to the movement.  Street car traffic ceased in Tacoma at 1 o'clock on the afternoon of February 6th, but a break in the strike restored service on the 8th.<br>
<br>
On February 10th the general strike orders were called off it becoming apparent that the wishes of the radical and I. W. W. element of labor unions was meeting with little sympathy from the public at large and on the part of wellmeaning labor leaders.  Many unions also commenced a movement to wrest the influence of the radicals from them and to purge their organizations from the detrimental influence of the "Reds" within their ranks.<br>
<br>
This strike was one of the most determined efforts made by I. W. W. members to gain supremacy in labor circles, and did more to arouse resentment against them than anything that had as yet transpired.  They were at their peak point of strength in the months that followed the close of the war, and stringent measures were taken against the leaders during 1919 and 1920.<br>

On February 26 the shipyard strikers agreed to take a referendum vote on the strike.  The following day a large number of Seattle radicals came to Tacoma and held a mass meeting in the Glide Rink, at South Eleventh and L streets, advocating a continuance of the strike.<br>
<br>
On March 5th the strikers voted upon a continuance or end of the strike, a majority favoring ending the strife; and on March llth thousands flocked back to the shipyards, to resume their former places under the same conditions and wages that existed when the costly strike was called.<br>
<br>
A roundup of "Reds" in Tacoma on the 13th resulted in six arrests being made by government officials, those taken being held for deportation.  On February 17th, Hugh C. Wallace, nationally prominent Tacoman, was nominated by President Woodrow Wilson for the post of ambassador to France, to succeed William G. Sharp, of Ohio.  The appointment was duly confirmed, and Mr. Wallace performed his high duties with dignity and honor to the United States.  On February 28th) H. Y. Walker, manager of the smelter, announced a reduction in wages at the big plant, qmounting to 121/2 per cent, bringing the wages for common laborers to a minimum of $3.75. Due to a slump in the copper industry, only one furnace was then being operated, instead of three.<br>
<br>
"TAG DAY" ARRESTS<br>
<br>
Saturday, April 5th, was a busy day for the police department of Tacoma and its patrol wagon, and the incidents of the day produced echoes that sounded for some days and weeks following.  The trouble all grew out of an attempt on the part of members of the "Soldiers' and Sailors' Council" to hold a tag day upon the streets without a license for so doing and in contravention to orders of the Tacoma Police Department.<br>
<br>
Several days previous Commissioner of Public Safety Pettit had refused the right to conduct a tag-selling campaign on the grounds that there were sufficient organizations operating in Tacoma who were taking care of discharged sailors and soldiers, and upon the further alleged ground that some of the men behind the movement were not considered as the right kind of leaders for returned service men.  In fact the organization did contain a large number of radicals, even if not entirely dominated by those who were using the name for purposes not considered entirely patriotic.<br>
<br>
The trouble started shortly after noon, when tag sellers appeared on Pacific Avenue to operate despite the edict of the city commissioners.  The patrol wagon was used frequently between Eleventh Street and the City Hall, and a total of about fifty were arrested.  Headquarters at 1132-11@ Pacific Avenue were raided by
the police during the afternoon, and all books, pamphlets and other documents taken in charge.  "Paddy" Morris and his wife were arrested at the headquarters.  Organizer Beard, for the Tacoma Central Labor Council, was also placed under arrest with the others.<br>
<br>
Pending negotiations between tag sellers and authorities during the afternoon, Tacoma business streets were the scenes of lively but good-natured demonstrations by sympathizers and curious onlookers.  Crowds of shipworkers gathered at Eleventh and Pacific to give courage to members of the club.<br>
<br>
Banners appeared in the streets in the afternoon calling for a mass meeting at Eagles' Hall on Sunday, to protest the action of the city council.  Dodgers were also circulated during the afternoon at the shipyards, asserting that "Overseas Soldiers and Sailors Arrested for Selling Tags.  Shall the Commercial Club Ruin the Organization?"<br>
<br>
In commenting upon the day's events, Chief of Police Harry Smith said for publication that "It is just a question of whether this city is going to be run by the regular con-stituted officers, or by a gang of self-constituted civic managers.  The police have orders to pick up every man selling tags without a license from the city council.  We will keep on arresting these men until they are legally permitted to sell tags."<br>
<br>
New arrests were made on Monday, the 7th.  The arrests were ordered by -Pettit and Smith with a view of breaking up the radical control of the council.  John C. Johns, of Seattle, -one of the ringleaders; Steve Burke, secretary of the council; -and G. L. Kelling, recording secretary, were rounded up by the police.  Many of the radical leaders of the council were from Seattle and other points.<br>
<br>
The many incidents connected with this episode naturally created much newspaper talk and street comment.  They were even made the subject of discussion from the pulpits of the city, and one sermon, entitled "Play Tag Charity," caused much comment upon its own accord.  On April 10th the labor council, by a vote of 38 to 12, decided to assist in a recall of the mayor and com.missioners.  It might be said in this connection that many were absent from the meeting, only 50 of the 145 delegates participating in the vote.  "I accept the issue, " said Mayor C. M. Riddell, when confronted with a possible recall movement.  "If we are to have a fight between the Russian Bolshevik idea and the American idea of government, I am for the United States.<br>
<br>
"The action of this bunch Saturday justifies the action of the
council in refusing them any concession to collect money on the streets of the city.  The council went into this thing thoroughly.  We knew what we were doing when we refused their request for a permit for tag day.<br>
<br>
"We had had a careful investigation made and discovered just what this crowd represented." A test case growing out of the arrests was made on the 17th before Police Judge Hackett, the city winning, and the defendant, George Gerlich, being fined $5.  Balked in their efforts to hold a tag day, members of the organization next appeared with subscription lists, asking for donations.<br>
<br>
"NEWS-TRIBUNE" FLAYS LOCAL "REDS"<br>
<br>
Following closely upon the tag day incident was the action of radicals in the Tacoma Labor Council in reference to the forthcoming Victory Loan and which called forth a scathing editorial in the Tacoma News-Tribune under the caption of "Kick Out the Traitors," and which explains the events referred to:<br>
<br>
"The 'Red' group, which has seized control of the Central Labor Council of Tacoma, has carried its anti-American campaign so far as to actually try to repudiate the forthcoming Victory loan.<br>
"Wednesday night this faction blocked the appointment of a representative to the loan committee, and by such refusal expressed open disapproval of this country's appeal for funds.  Sneering speeches were made against the Victory loan and the purpose for which its funds will be used.<br>
<br>
"This action is the culmination of a series of disloyal votes and speeches which have disgusted the rank and file of loyal labor in Tacoma, as well as all other citizens.  By their manipulations the Reds have publicly branded the Central Labor Council as unamerican and Bolshevik, while as a matter of fact many of the members of this council are loyal and faithful citizens.<br>
<br>
"Make no mistake about the action of the council last night.  It no more represents the sentiment of organized labor of Tacoma than it does that of the great army of boys in khaki who fought nobly and heroically to stay the hordes of the Kaiser in France.  Thousands of these boys now sleep the eternal sleep in the fields of Flanders and France.  Now the Reds dare to attempt to repudiate their work and discredit the forthcoming Victory loan.<br>
<br>
"This country is still at war and such action is as close to treason as the radicals dare go publicly.  It will arouse as great a storm in labor circles as it will elsewhere.<br>
<br>
"It is unfortunate that a handful of anarchists have the power to take such an action and aid in spreading the unfair and absurd impression which now prevails throughout the East and Middle West,
that Puget Sound is Bolshevik.  This will continue until organized labor kicks out the Reds and near-traitors who use union labor's name on every possible occasion to further their own selfish ends."<br>

IWW IN 1920.<br>
<br>
William P. Bonney, "Pierce County and the IWW in 1920," <B>History of Pierce County.<br>
<br>
</B>During the first week in January, twenty-one county prisoners who had been confined in jail on a charge of criminal syndicalism and suspected of being I. W. W. members, were released, under orders of Judge John D. Fletcher.  Prosecuting Attorney Askren gave insufficient evidence as the reasons for dismissal.<br>
<br>
About fifty were still confined on similar charges, however.  There was talk at this time of holding the trial of those arrested in the Centralia outbreak in Pierce County, but affidavits were prepared showing that the local jail was taxed to its capacity, and that a change of venue to this county could not be entertained for that reason.<br>
<br>
On January 21st, William Randall was found guilty in the Federal Court on a conspiracy charge of publishing and circulating seditious literature.  This was the first conviction to be secured in Pierce County since the drive against agitators was commenced during the previous fall.  Randall was arrested the previous November in a raid on the I. W. W. Hall at 1325 1/2 Broadway.<br>
<br>
On January 23rd thirty-six alleged members of the I. W. W. went on trial in the Superior Court, before Judge John D. Fletcher.  Their motions for separate trials were denied.  Prosecuting Attorney W. D. Askren was assisted in the trials by Thomas W. Holman, prosecuting attorney of Jefferson County.  Ralph Pierce, of Seattle, represented the defendants.  On February 2nd the jury, after being out fifty-nine hours, brought in a verdict of guilty against the entire thirtysix.  Eleven more were still confined in jail awaiting trial.<br>
<br>
The verdict returned by the jury read: "We, the jury, find the defendants guilty of criminal syndicalism, but recommend to the court to exercise the utmost clemency in passing sentence." It was announced that one of the defendants, a twenty-two-year-old Dutch cigarmaker, would be deported.<br>
<br>
Thirty-five members of the I. W. W. recently convicted were sentenced on March 2nd to from ten years to eighteen months in jail, or assessed fines ranging from $250 to  $500.  Two defendants under twenty-one years of age were given suspended sentences by Judge Fletcher.<br>

"Kidnapers have made headlines often in Tacoma," <B>Tacoma News Tribune.</B> June 27, 1969.<br>
<br>
Tacoma seems to have had more than its share of kidnapings stretching from the mid 1930s when abduction rated just behind bank robbing in popularity among the country's gangsters  until almost today.<br>
<br>
The major kidnapings include:<br>
<br>
George Weyerhaeuser, May 24, 1935.<br>
<br>
Mildred Hook, November 23, 1935.<br>
<br>
Charles Mattson, December 27, 1836.<br>
<br>
Ann Marie Burr, August 31, 1961<br>
<br>
Charles Hyde III, November 17, 1965.<br>
<br>
Three of them ended tragically and two have never been solved. The Hooks and Mattson kidnapings became murders when the victims were found dead. Ann Marie Burr just vanished.<br>
<br>
In both the Weyerhaeuser and Hyde cases, the boys were released after ransoms were paid, and later the kidnapers were caught and sent to prison.<br>
<br>
George Weyerhaeuser, now president of the timber company that bears his name, was nine when he was kidnaped while walking from the Lowell School to Annie Wright Seminary to meet his sister for lunch.<br>
<br>
Rumors were heard everywhere as fifteen FBI agents joined local forces to conduct their investigations practically in secret. But rumor became fact when the boy was released on June 1 after payment of two hundred thousand dollars ransom.<br>
<br>
The abductors had been holding the boy in Spokane, and turned him loose near Issaquah. Young Weyerhaeuser walked to a nearby farm and the world soon learned he was safe and free.<br>
<br>
The numbers of the ransom bills eventually led to the arrest of Mr. and Mrs. Harmon W. Waley here, and they implicated William Dainard who was captured the next year in San Francisco. They were tried in U.S. District Court and Waley drew a forty-five year term, his wife twenty and Dainard sixty as the leader of the plot.<br>
<br>
Douglas Van Vlack approached Mildred Hook, who had divorced him not long before on the evening of November 23, 1935 as she stepped from a trolley on the way to her parent's home.<br>
<br>
The former wife was forced at pistol point into Van Vlack's auto.<br>

Before this case ended, two Idaho lawmen had been shot dead by Van Vlack, Mildred Hook's body was found in a culvert where Van Vlack had forced her to crawl and then shot her, and Van Vlack leaped to his own death in the state penitentiary the evening of December 9, 1937, the day before he had a date with the gallows.<br>
<br>
Charles Mattson, the ten year old son of Mr. and Mrs. W.W. Mattson was kidnaped on Christmas Eve, 1936, while his parents were looking and Christmas tree lights around the city. The kidnaper forced his way into the home with a gun and left a twenty-eight thousand dollar ransom note.<br>
<br>
While the father tried desperately to establish contact with the kidnaper, nothing solid ever came of the effort and the boy's body was found near Everett on January 11, 1937. An exhaustive investigation left a mystery that remains to this day.<br>
<br>
Perhaps an even more exhaustive investigation was made after Ann Marie Burr disappeared...with the same outcome.<br>
<br>
Her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Donald B. Burr, found the oldest of their four children missing from her bedroom on that August morning. They also discovered the front door open, after it had been locked and latched the night before and a small window in the living room also open.<br>
<br>
A search that at one time involved 800 soldiers, National Guardsmen, lawmen and volunteers found nothing. No ransom was ever asked, and although there have been a few confessions, none every stood up under close probing.<br>
<br>
The five thousand dollar reward remains unclaimed.<br>
<br>
Charles H. Hyde, III, 12745 Gravelly Lake Drive, whose father was president of West Coast Grocery Company was forced into an automobile while he was walking to school. The father acted immediately on ransom instructions for $45,000 and the 13 year old was released about 5:00p.m. the same day near the Old Town Dock.<br>
<br>
Tilford G. Baker surrender a couple of days later, and turned $34,360 over to the police. In the next few days Dean Allen Bromley was arrested in Arkansas, and James E. Evans who had fled to California drove back to turn himself in, along with $2,260.<br>
<br>
Convicted in a February 1966 trial, Baker and Bromley were given life sentences and Evans ten years.<br>
<br>
On appeal, a new trial for Bromley was ordered but the result was the same,and he received another life sentence on May 1968.<br>

John Bailey, "Weyerhaeuser, Mattson kidnapings major Tacoma news thirty years ago," <B>Tacoma News Tribune.</B> November 18, 1965.<br>
<br>
It has been nearly thirty years since the words Kidnap and Ransom have screamed from Tacoma headlines, reporting the demand for money for the return of a youngster abducted in Tacoma.<br>
<br>
These words, appeared again Thursday to relate the return of Charles H. Hyde III after payment of $45,000 in ransom. Three decades ago the same words appeared in two other sensational kidnap cases.<br>
<br>
One of them mirrored by the present kidnaping. George Weyerhaeuser, then nine years old, had been ransomed by his father for $200,000 after being held seen day by three kidnapers. He also was released unharmed.<br>
<br>
Mattson Tragedy<br>
<br>
Another major Tacoma kidnaping a year later, in 1936, ended in tragedy. Charles Mattson, aged ten, the son of Dr. and Mrs. W.W. Mattson was found dead after he was kidnaped from the family home.<br>
<br>
There have been others, but these two kidnap cases will be remembered most vividly by Tacomans.<br>
<br>
The Weyerhaeuser boy was kidnaped as he was walking from classes at Lowell School to meet his sister at Annie Wright Seminary so they could go home for lunch together at noon on May 24, 1935.<br>
<br>
The famous Lindbergh kidnaping case was still fresh in the minds of people across the nation. That kidnaping led to the Lindbergh act of 1932 and brought the Federal  Bureau of Investigation to Tacoma in the Weyerhaeuser case. It was headlined across the country for the next ten days.<br>
<br>
Taken to Spokane<br>
<br>
The Weyerhaeuser boy was taken to a rented house in Spokane and was kept there until the two hundred thousand dollars ransom were paid, and then he was released on a road near Issaquah.  He had been given a blanket to keep him warm and a dollar bill was stuffed in his pocket. The boy made his way to a nearby farm home and was returned to Tacoma.<br>
<br>
Weyerhaeuser, grandson of the founder of the Weyerhaeuser Company, still remembers details of the abduction, being stuffed in a car with a blanket covering, riding for hours cramped int the trunk; being led blindfolded through woods and across logs over creeks; being chained and put into holes in the ground; and being hidden in a dark stuffy closet.
His kidnapers would caught and most of the money was recovered.<br>
<br>
Principal in the kidnaping, Harmon Metz Waley, spent 28 years behind bars. He was released from McNeil Island federal penitentiary in June, 1963, he was fifty-two at the time.<br>
<br>
Also convicted was Waley's wife, Margaret. She later was released. They were arrested in Salt Lake City about a month after the kidnaping when Mrs. Waley attempted to spend a marked ransom bill.<br>
<br>
Third member of the trio, William D. Mahan, whose real named was William Dainard, was captured in San Francisco the following year. Dainard who had a criminal record and was said to be the principal plotter, was convicted in U.S. District Court here and was given two consecutive terms of sixty years.<br>
<br>
The Mattson by was taken from his home on December 27, 1936, while he was inspecting lights on the Christmas tree with his brother and sister and a sister's friend.<br>
<br>
The kidnaper, armed with a pistol, forced his way into the home while the parents were away.  He grabbed the boy and left a note demanding $28,000 ransom. Dr. Mattson received other ransom notes, some or all of which were bogus. He made every effort to contact the kidnaper but was unable to do so and the ransom was not paid.<br>
<br>
The body of the kidnaped boy finally was found on January 11, 1937, along a road near Everett. He apparently had been dead for ten days.<br>
<br>
The FBI investigated 25,740 suspects, among them dozens of persons who confessed, either to get attention or because of mental disorders. One of these was a 34 year old escapee from Medical Lake Hospital. It was later learned that he was in the hospital at the time of the crime.<br>
<br>
The case has never been solved, but the FBI has kept it in active  files through the years and has continued its investigation.<br>
<br>
In another Tacoma kidnap case about a month before the Mattson kidnapping, Mildred Hook, daughter of Joseph F. Hook, a Tacoma writer, was kidnaped by Douglas Van Vlack, whom she had recently divorced.<br>
<br>
Van Vlack forced his former wife to enter his auto at pistol point and drove her to Idaho. Van Vlack was arrested in Twin Falls, Idaho and his former wife's body later was found in a culvert, where he had forced her to crawl before her shot her.<br>
<br>
Van Vlack was convicted of her murder but cheated the gallows by leaping to his death in a thirty foot plunge to a concrete floor the evening before he was to hang.<br>
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
<br>
TRAGIC MATTSON CASE<br>
<br>
Then, on December 27, 1936, Charles Mattson, son of Dr. and Mrs. W. W. Mattson was kidnaped from the family home early that Sunday evening. The Mattson were away from the house inspecting lighted Christmas trees entered in the contest of that year.  Charles, aged ten, was with his older sister and brother. The kidnaper, displaying a pistol forced his way into the house snatched Charles in his arms left a $28,000 ransom demand and vanished through the rear of the home toward the waterfront below. Dr. Mattson received several ransom notes, some or all of which were spurious. He made every effort to contact the kidnaper, but was unable to do so.<br>
<br>
Finally on January 11, 1937, the body of the kidnaped boy was found along a road near Everett.<br>
<br>
This cruel and scandalous offense was at once put at the top of the FBI list on unsolved crimes. Every clue was followed and more than 500 persons were questioned. After twenty-five years the case remains as dark and mysterious as the mind of the man who perpetuated it. There was even a strange "confession" on July 12, 1938, that produced a big banner in <B>The News Tribune</B>. A man giving the name of Frank Olson admitted the crime but he turned out to be a crackpot or a notoriety seeker.<br>
<br>
These three major kidnapings were not the first in Tacoma. There was the Stagg kidnaping in 1920, followed by the Rust kidnaping the following year.<br>
<br>
George T. Stagg, handsome and spirited, came to Tacoma as an airman and parachutist, and became a reporter on <B>The News Tribune</B>. He married Edith Cunningham, a writer on <B>The Times</B> early in 1918. A son was born to them and in July 1919, Mrs. Stagg was granted a divorce, given the custody of Bobby, the baby, and fifty dollars a month alimony. At the time Stagg, having been recalled into the Army air service, was on duty in California.<br>
<br>
Later Stagg came back to Puget Sound and joined the staff of a Seattle newspaper. There he met Miss Betty Brainerd, daughter of Erastus Brainerd, former editor of the <B>Seattle Post Intelligencer.</B> She joined him in a fantastic plot to kidnap his twenty-one month old son.<br>
<br>
They came to Tacoma September 14, 1920 and spirited the child away from his mother's home. The abduction created an uproar. Miss Brainerd was later arrested in New York City but she refused to waive extradition. Then Bobby was returned to his mother at a hotel in Vancouver, B. C. and Miss Brainerd consented to come to Tacoma and face trial set for December 31, 1920.<br>
<br>
Rumors that Stagg would play the part of a gentleman and clear Miss Brainerd were verified when he gave himself up, exonerated his companion, pleased guilty in  Superior Court and received a
sentence of ten to fifteen years in the state penitentiary.<br>
<br>
He was pardoned by Lt. Governor W. J. (Wee) Coyle, acting in the absence from the state of Governor Hart, after serving ten months. Newsmen who knew Stagg were sure he had paid his penalty. He foolishly became a kidnaper as a lark and found to his surprise that he had committed a felony of high degree.<br>

<br>
ARTHUR RUST KIDNAPPED<br>
<br>
Herbert Hunt, "Arthur Rust Kidnapped," <B>History of Tacoma.<br>
</B><br>
As young Arthur Rust was walking downtown to his work in the Bank of California on the morning of February 1st, an automobile drew up along the curb, and the driver genially inquired: "Going downtown, Buddy? Hop in." Rust accepted the invitation, but instead of arriving at his intended destination, he was taken to the garage of the Puget Sound Iron and Steel Works on the tideflats, bound, and forced at the point of a revolver to write a demand upon his wealthy father for $25,000 ransom.<br>
<br>
Plans of the kidnapper went astray, however, and through some quick assistance of the police, the twenty-year-old boy was rescued.  A day or two later $500 reward was offered for the arrest of Rust's abductor.<br>
<br>
The young messenger boy who had delivered the written demand for the $25,000 was held in the city jail for several days and until it was concluded that he had no part in planning the crime.<br>
<br>
On March 9th, Hugh C. VanAmburgh, former "Devil Dog," and hero of many battles in France, was arrested and charged with the kidnapping.  VanAmburgh had served with the Second Division in France, had been awarded two Croix de Guerres, and received a Distin uished Service Cross.  At his trial which followed he claimed as a defense that young Rust was a party to the scheme, and won an acquittal at the hands of a jury.<br>
<br>
However, the incident was not closed nor the true facts known until on September 24th, when VanAmburgh signed an affidavit admitting that his testimony was not true and exonerating Rust from all connection with the plot.<br>

<br>
WALEYS RETURNED FROM OLYMPIA TO CONTINUE HEARING<br>
<br>
("Waleys returned from Olympia to continue hearing," <B>Tacoma Times.</B> June 21, 1935).<br>
<br>
Guarded by Department of Justice agents, Harmon Waley and his wife, Margaret, were taken into Federal Court here Friday afternoon for a continuation of their arraignment before Judge Cushman on charges of having kidnaped little George Weyerhaeuser for $200,000 ransom.<br>
<br>
The Waleys were brought here from the Thurston County jail in Olympia, where they were returned late yesterday after counsel had been named by the court.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Cleo I. Bonney, mother of Waley, said today she understood that Waley and his wife would enter pleas of guilty. Their attorney, Steve O'Brien, named by the court also said they would plead guilty.<br>
<br>
First determined not to employ counsel "because we haven't any friends" Waley, a small town bad boy who failed in his first big time crime, consented to let Attorney O'Brien, Tacoma, represent them after the language of the indictment, as read by Judge Cushman puzzled the defendants.<br>
<br>
As Waley listened to the indictments charging that he, his wife, and William Mahan, a fugitive who violated the Lindberg kidnaping law, conspired to use the mails to defraud and to use the mails to extort and to the single indictment charging Mrs. Waley with mailing a ransom contact note to John Philip Weyerhaeuser, lumberman, the accused man interrupted the proceedings.<br>
<br>
"The indictments say all three of us conspired to kidnap the boy," he said. "Does that mean before or after he was kidnaped?"<br>
<br>
The question, a crucial one in the Waley's fight against punishment was not answered. Instead Judge Cushman advised them to accept O'Brien's services as agent for John F. Dore, Seattle attorney whom Mrs. Waley's parents recommended.<br>
<br>
The defendant accepted and the three, O'Brien and the prisoners went into conference. The arraignment then was postponed until this afternoon.<br>
<br>
O'Brien in indicating Mrs. Waley would plead "Not  Guilty" despite full confessions said that all available information showed she had
no knowledge of her husband's kidnaping plans until informed that the boy was in their house at Spokane several days after the crime.<br>
<br>
Federal indictments charged otherwise in naming her on all the charges made against the men and adding the additional charge that she sent one of the notes which led Weyerhaeuser to pay $200,000 for his son's release.<br>
<br>
She was arrested in Salt Lake City later while purchasing a ten cent article with one of the five dollar Federal Reserve notes Weyerhaeuser had paid Mahan in a rendezvous on the Pacific Highway near Seattle. Her arrest led to her husband's capture and to their admission that Mahan was implicated. The latter escaped from police at Butte, Montana,and is still at large.<br>
<br>
In court Thursday, Waley handed the court a telegram from relatives of Mrs. Waley from Salt Lake City in which they urged the Waleys to get an attorney mentioning former Mayor Dore of Seattle.<br>
<br>
Judge Cushman stressed the seriousness of the offense, and urged that the defendants have counsel. "Don't you have some friends who know an attorney?" the judge asked.<br>
<br>
"We haven't any friends," Waley said nervously.<br>
<br>
Then attorney O'Brien stepped forward and said he would represent them. He handles legal matters in Tacoma for Dore.<br>
<br>
Waley explained that he did not feel he needed an attorney, but said he and his wife charged with Mahan wanted the indictments explained to them.<br>
<br>
"In that even, I believe we could be ready to proceed with the arraignment tomorrow," O'Brien said and the court ordered the hearing for 2:00 p.m. Friday.<br>
<br>
The Waleys were brought from the Thurston County jail to the Federal Court by government men.<br>
<br>
Waley, a florid-faced strapping six footer, appeared far more nervous than his young wife as they faced a crowded court room.<br>
<br>
He fumbled with his hands and constantly sought to shield his face from news photographers. His wife kept her head lowered and avoided the gaze of the crowd.<br>
<br>
After the hearing the Waleys were escorted from the court by Federal Agents and locked up. A little later, at 4;00 p.m. they were returned to the Thurston County jail.<br>
<br>
("Waley's returned from Olympia to continue hearing," <B>Tacoma Times.</B> June 21, 1935.).<br>

<br>
DEFENSE RESTS; MRS WALEY CAST TO JURORS SOON<br>
<br>
(Paul Busselle, "Defense rests; Mrs. Waley case to jurors soon, crossing examination of woman taken U.S District Attorney Only 12 minutes; convicted man not on stand," <B>Tacoma Times.</B> July 12, 1935).<br>
<br>
The fate of Mrs. Margaret Waley, 19, accused of being implicated in the kidnaping of little George Weyerhaeuser for $200,000 ransom, will be in the hands of 12 jurors within a few hours.<br>
<br>
At the conclusion of the government's short cross-examination of the young women, who is accused of violation of the Lindbergh kidnap law and conspiracy to extort the $200,000 ransom paid for the boy's return, the defense, in a surprise move, rested its case.<br>
<br>
When court reconvened at l0:00 o'clock U.S. District Attorney J. Charles Dennis began cross examination of Mrs. Waley. It lasted but twelve minutes.  Her testimony given at the trail Thursday afternoon as not shaken in any way.<br>
<br>
It had been expected that Attorney John Dore, counsel for Mrs. Waley, would then call Harmon Waley, husband of the accused woman to take the stand. Instead he announced the defense would rest.<br>
<br>
Waley, under sentence of 45 years is in the federal penitentiary on McNeil Island for his participation in the Weyerhaeuser kidnaping was brought here Thursday to testify. He was kept in the city jail over night and was being held at the marshal's office today when the defense rested.<br>
<br>
U.S. Assistant District Attorney Owen Hughes began the government's address to the jury at 10:15 o'clock. Hughes branded the testimony of the gum chewing defendant as "...the biggest of fabrications."<br>
<br>
When court recessed at noon, Hughes had not completed his argument. He was expected to complete the address within a short time after the court reconvenes at 2:00 p.m.<br>
<br>
Chief Defense Counsel Dore will then start addressing the jury. Dore intimated that his address would occupy "...between an hour and an hour and a half."<br>
<br>
Government attorney Dennis, who will present the rebuttal address to the jury, expects to be finished "...within half an hour."<br>
<br>
Following instructions to the jury by Judge E.E.Cushman, presiding over the trial, deliberation will start.<br>
<br>
Should the girl be found guilty, Dore declared that he will appeal the verdict.
Hughes stressed the various aliases used by both Mrs. Waley and her husband, prior to and during the kidnaping to the jury.<br>
<br>
He charged that the typewritten ransom and contact letters were either "written by Harmon Metz Waley or this defendant, Margaret Waley."<br>
<br>
He denied that she could be ignorant of the fact that the Weyerhaeuser boy had been kidnaped "with all the radio broadcasts, the newspaper stories about the 'snatch.'"<br>
<br>
Hughes held that the trip Mrs. Waley and Mahan made together to Yakima was for the purpose of "...mapping the route they were to take to Spokane...they were checking on road blockades.they went to see what chances they had in getting through the Snoqualmie Pass."<br>
<br>
Commenting on the young woman's testimony that she was forced to lay down on the floor of the car when the boy was brought to the machine, Owens asked the jury:<br>
<br>
"Were they hiding the boy from her, or were they hiding her from the boy?"<br>
<br>
"They were hiding her from the boy...so she cold not be later identified by George Weyerhaeuser," the brown haired blue eyed attorney declared.<br>
<br>
Hughes challenged Mrs. Waley's contention that she "..feared Mahan's threats of death..."<br>
<br>
"They both had coffee together in Yakima. Where is there any proof there of cohersion or duress, or threat of bodily harm?" he asked.<br>
<br>
Hughes again referred to the woman's laying on the car floor at the insistence of her husband and Mahan.<br>
<br>
"It was foolish to presume that any American wife, I don't care whether she is Mormon or Jew , would not protest getting into such a position...I know my wife would, and any other wife would too."<br>
<br>
The attorney declared there was "...no question but what they transported the boy into the State of Idaho."<br>
<br>
Pointing his finger at the defendant, who dropped her gaze to the thick carpeted floor, Hughes shouted,"If she had any woman's soul, she knew that boy's mother's heart was crying for his return.<br>
<br>
"There is no doubt," the attorney continued, "but that she knew about the kidnaping. She was a necessary ingredient to allay suspicion."<br>
<br>
Mrs. Waley began her fight for liberty at 3:40 o'clock Thursday afternoon after Federal Judge E.E. Cushman, presiding over the
trial denied motions of Chief Defense Attorney John F. Dore to dismiss the two counts against the girl-wife.<br>
<br>
In concluding his argument before Judge Cushman, Dore declared that the indictment should be dismissed and "..this case sent back to the state where it belongs..."<br>
<br>
U.S. District Attorney J. Charles Dennis attacked Dore's arguments for dismissal of the two counts in the indictment and was upheld by the court.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Waley who said she was "rather nervous" and was subject to attacks of "St.Vitus dance,"  declared she first learned that the Weyerhaeuser boy was kidnaped was when she read accounts of the "snatch" in newspapers on the afternoon of May 25, while she was residing in Seattle.<br>

KIDNAPING BIGGEST CRIME NEWS IN TACOMA<br>
<br>
Paul W. Harvey, "Kidnaping biggest crime news in Tacoma,' one of five abductions remains a myster," <B>Tacoma Sunday Ledger,</B> May 20, 1962.<br>
<br>
What has been called the most sensational crime in Tacoma's history occurred on May 24, 1935. George Philip Weyerhaeuser, 9, son of Mr. and Mrs. J.P. Weyerhaeuser, Jr. was kidnaped as he was waling at noon from his classes at Lowell School to meet his sister at Annie Wright Seminary to go home with her for lunch. the kidnapers demanded $200,000 ransom.<br>
<br>
Tacoma at once became a news center of the nation. reporters from press associations and large newspapers gathered here. Fifteen operators from the Federal Bureau of Investigation joined city, county, and state officials on the case. The Weyerhaeuser kidnaping was the big story over the land for the next ten days.<br>
<br>
The FBI men had little to say about their operations which left the field open to speculation. The newsmen dreamed up some dazzling stories about where the kidnaped boy might have been taken, whether or not the ransom had been paid, just what criminal gang might be invovled or whether it was a local operation.<br>
<br>
All this seemed to be necessary at the time and <B>The News Tribune's</B> Nelson A. Hong, genial and urbane, could conjecture and surmise with the best of them.
As a matter of fact the ransom was paid, and on Sunday, June 1, <B>The News Tribune</B> carried the news in boxcar letters, "Kidnaped Boy Safe at Home, Freed Unharmed After Payment of $200,000 Ransom."<br>
<br>
The story related that the kidnapers had released young George early that morning on a road near Issaquah. He made his way to the nearby farm home of George Bonifas and revealed his identity. Bonifas lost no time telephoning the good news to Tacoma and promised he would drive the boy here as speedily as possible.<br>
<br>
REPORTER'S BOLD ACTION<br>
<br>
Bonifas cranked up his old car and headed for Tacoma, but he did not deliver George to his parents. That was because John H. Dreher, a fast thinking reporter for the <B>Seattle Times</B> played a hunch. He hired a taxi at the Winthrop Hotel and drove north on the highway toward Seattle.  Sure enough he soon met Bonifas car, bamboozled Bonifast into turning the boy over to him, and drove him to the Weyerhaeuser home.<br>
<br>
But not so fast as to preclude an interview with the kidnap victim that was a great news beat. It was copyrighted and sent out by The Associated Press and carried by <B>The News Tribune</B> that day.<br>
<br>
George Weyerhaeuser deported himself handsomely when he met the press that afternoon. He revealed that he had undergone the harrow events of the abduction with patience, fortitude and courage remarkable for his years.<br>
<br>
It was later discovered that the kidnapers had taken their victim to a rented house in Spokane and had kept him there until the ransom  was paid.<br>
<br>
<B>The News Tribune</B> printed many columns of stories and pictures on the kidnaping that Saturday and <B>The Ledger</B> presented fuller details on Sunday.<br>
<br>
BILL NUMBERS LISTED<br>
<br>
The FBI has recored the number of every five, ten and twenty dollar bill in the two hundred thousand dollar ransom. A circular was sent to banks and business houses over the nation, and some newspapers printed the entire list. This detailed precaution paid off. About twenty of the bills soon turned up at various cities in the western states and on June 8, several were spotted in Salt Lake City.<br>
<br>
Banks and stores there were urged to tighten their watchfulness. On June 11, a woman offered one of the bills for a small purchase at a Woolworth store there. An alert clerk spotted the number. The woman was arrested and led police to her husband.<br>
<br>
They were Mr. and  Mrs. Herman Metz Waley, who had been living near Puyallup. Waley had long resided in this area, and while he had been in minor trouble with the law from time to time, he was an
unlikely prospect for  a role in a big time crime.<br>
<br>
Waley involved William D. Mahan, whose real name was William Dainard, Dainard, who had a criminal record, was captured in San Francisco the next year. More than half of the ransom was recovered.<br>
<br>
KIDNAPERS CONVICTED<br>
<br>
All three of the kidnapers were convicted in U.S. District Court here in trials fully covered in the local and national press. Waley was sentenced to forty-five years and his wife to twenty. Dainard, as the principal plotter and the hardened criminal drew two consecutive terms of sixty years.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Waley is now free.  Waley is due for release from McNeil Island in 1965. Dainard, who was transferred to Leavenworth Federal Prison in 1956 will be lucky to come out alive.<br>

GEORGE WEYERHAEUSER KIDNAPPING.<br>
<br>
Emmett Watson, "Little Boy Lost," <B>Once Upon A Time in Seattle.</B> Seattle: Lesser Seattle Press, 1992, p. 55-72.<br>
<br>
It was June, 3, 1935, and the old Civic Field, a pebble strewn, bare-dirt, low-rent baseball park, was alive with hundreds of kids.  There was no grass at all, in either the outfield or the infield.  The field was surrounded by tin fences, which easily bent enough for us to sneak in and watch the old Seattle Indians play at night.<br>
<br>
For all of its dusty hardness, Civic Field was sacred ground.  On this repellent, skinned diamond there trod such hometown heroes as "High pockets" Bill Lawrence, Dick Gyselman, Alan Strange, Levi "Chief" McCormick, Hal Spindel, Jerry Donovan, Alike Hunt, Dick Barrett and Hal Turpin.<br>
<br>
Seattle was in the Pacific Coast League, which included such distant cities as San Diego, San Francisco and Los Angeles.  And on the hardpan surface we watched the likes of Joe DiMaggio, of San Francisco, take his first steps toward baseball's Hall of Fame.<br>
<br>
The team was then owned by George Vanderveer, the great criminal-and-labor attorney who lived near Franklin High School.  He was going broke trying to keep the minor league franchise afloat.  He was so broke he tried to give it away, free, to Dave Beck, the powerful head of the local Teamsters Union.  Beck was a
baseball fan, but he said, "No, George, no.  I couldn't afford the first-baseman's salary." It was the bottom of the Great Depression.<br>
<br>
There was a free "baseball school" in progress.  We kids showed up in sweat shirts and bent caps.  Many of us wore Keds, not spiked baseball shoes, and some of us wore dark brown "commissary cords," free clothing from the Federal Government. But we were rich in<br>
dreams.  We, too, would be the next Dimaggio.<br>
<br>
There must have been a dozen instructors, mostly high school coaches and semi-pro managers, at this baseball school. Among them were Frank "Bush "Tobin, a catcher of Coast League caliber, and Bobby Morris, famed on weekends as a college football referee.<br>
<br>
And there was "Tubby" Graves, who coached baseball at the University of Washington.  Tubby was a big man, wide in the hips, big feet, with a way of slouching when he walked.  He had a booming, friendly voice, full of laughter, and being from Missouri, he had a slightly southern accent and a poetic gift for memorable similes and imagery.<br>
<br>
"Over here!" he boomed.  "Over here by the fence, we're going to learn how to hit."<br>
<br>
So maybe two dozen of us future DiMaggios stood around Tubby near the left-field fence and he was swinging a bat idly in his huge hands.<br>
<br>
Then he said: "Let's imagine you have just cornered the Weyerhaeuser kidnapper.  You're gonna hit the Weyerhaeuser kidnapper in the belly."<br>
<br>
Tubby held his bat high over his shoulder, waving it in exaggerated circles above his head.  "Too much motion, too much wasted time," he said.  "You're never gonna hit the Weyerhaeuser kidnapper that way.  He'll either be gone or he'll move in and take the bat away from you."<br>
<br>
Tubby drew himself into a compact batting stance, the bat cocked and still.  "There's his belly, now you swing.  No waste motion, no fancy stuff, just-wham! Right into the Weyerhaeuser kidnapper's belly."<br>
<br>
It was the perfect analogy.  Every knew what Tubby Graves was talking about.  The Weyerhaeuser kidnapping! It was all over-on
radio, in newspapers, in restaurants, on street corners.  This was the story that consumed the Northwest and the nation.<br>
<br>
Outside, on our way to Civic Field that morning, were the headlines: "Family Fails to Contact Weyerhaeuser Kidnapper, " "Hunt For Kidnappers Centers in Seattle-Death Threatened.',<br>
The Weyerhaeuser kidnapping occurred at 11:45 on Friday morning, May 24,1935.<br>
<br>
The boy was picked up and forced into the back seat of a car while on his way home to lunch from Lowell Grammar School in Tacoma.  Little George Hunt Weyerhaeuser was nine years old.  He was a fourth generation Weyerhaeuser, scion of a family that owned great stands of timber in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Arkansas,  Vermont,  Oklahoma and several other states.<br>
<br>
Most of us couldn't spell the name of the enormously wealthy family who lived in Tacoma.  The Weyerhaeusers were reserved and private.  Yet now, suddenly, they were as well known as Charles A. Lindbergh, the legendary flyer whose son had been kidnapped and coldly murdered two years before.<br>
<br>
Police, sheriffs' deputies from three counties, criminologists and so-called kidnapping experts descended on Tacoma.  J. Edgar Hoover, then the Mr. Clean director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, sent teams of field agents to Tacoma.<br>
<br>
More than 50 newspaper people almost overwhelmed the Weyerhaeuser home at 420 North Fourth Street, a two-story mansion overlooking Commencement Bay. There were stories and human-interest sidebars.  One of the Seattle Times reporters was Paul O'Neil, who later wrote cover stories for Time, Life and Sports Illustrated.<br>
<br>
"Chin up, George! Don't let it get you down, boy," was the headline over one O'Neil story on the kidnapping.  Nothing, it seemed, went uncovered.  "George Manly Little Man, Says His Tacoma Barber." George's barber was Oliver DeBalt, whose chair was in the Winthrop Hotel, and he had granted an exclusive interview to the Times.<br>
<br>
The Times appointed an anonymous "Kidnap Editor" to handle tips and information from readers.<br>
<br>
Most newspapers said the kidnapping was the work of a disciplined mob rumored to be from the midwest.  The "Karpis Gang" got hefty play.  So did U.S. Marshal A.  J. Chitty, who pronounced the kidnapping "a big league job." Luke S. May, of the Seattle Police Department, a celebrated clue-finder of the day, was into the case.  
Another prominent cop answered to the euphonious name of 0. K. Bodia. 0. K. was widely quoted on theories and clues.<br>
<br>
George Weyerhaeuser was a slender boy, 4 feet 51/4 inches tall, with curly brown hair and brown eyes.  When he disappeared, George was wearing a sweater, brown corduroy pants and Keds tennis shoes. one acquaintance described George as "the manliest little man" he had ever known.  His fifth-grade teacher, a Miss Berg at Lowell Grammar School, said George was an alert, obedient and brilliant pupil, " having a "smiling, handsome face, with no distinguishing marks."<br>
<br>
On his way home to lunch that day in May -the day of the kidnapping-George practiced broad jumping (he wanted to be a track star).  He skipped through the grounds of the Tacoma Lawn and Tennis Club, then climbed a flight of stairs up to the main street.  A tan Buick was parked next to the curb.<br>
<br>
A man stood beside it. The man grabbed George, put his hand over his mouth, and threw him to the floor below the back seat of the car.  He covered George with a blanket and told him not to yell or try to move.  He put a blindfold on the boy.<br>
<br>
The tan Buick then rolled down the hill out of the quiet residential neighborhood.  It threaded its way along Tacoma streets and quickly was on rural back roads.  When George's blindfold was removed, he was in the woods, the sound of a river nearby.  He could see two men wearing hoods with eye holes.<br>
George was put into a pit dug in the woods.<br>
<br>
The pit was about three feet long and was covered with tin and braced with boards.  One arm and one leg were hand cuffed to a crosspiece in the bottom of the pit.  He was told write his name on the back of an envelope and again on the back of the ransom note.<br>
<br>
The ransom note was mailed, special delivery, the evening of the kidnapping.  It was a long note to the family containing 21 points, the first five of which specified that the ransom was to be $200,000 in cash, to consist of $ 100,000 in twenty dollar bills, $50,000 in ten dollar bills, $50,000 in five-dollar bills, all of it in Federal Reserve notes and unmarked.<br>
<br>
Point 12 of the ransom note instructed the Weyerhaeusers, "In five days or as soon as you have the money; advertise in the Seattle P-I personal column. <B>Say 'we</B> are ready.' And sign it, 'Percy Minnie."'<br>
<br>

You <B>win </B>be notified where to go when the time comes, said point 17.  Point 19 was chilling and explicit: "Just follow the rules and you will get along fine.  Don't follow them and it will be sorrowful.  FOR YOU NOT FOR US.<br>
<br>
The ransom note was signed "Egoist."<br>
<br>
This brought on the psychiatrists.  Dr. Harry R. Hoffman of Chicago studied the ransom note and said Egoist was, "a man unusually well-educated, probably with college training; medically and legally sane; definitely homicidal, if trapped; careful and methodical; with a surprisingly high order of intelligence."<br>
Another psychiatrist, Dr. A. C. Stewart of Tacoma, took his cut at the ransom note.  He said that whoever wrote it "was an adult of very low mental grade.',<br>
<br>
But the cops and the press continued to think of Egoist as a cluster of hoods, the kidnapping as mob inspired.  The kidnapping, they insisted, was the  work of ruthless, cunning men.<br>
<br>
The kidnappers turned out to be not a gang, or a mob, but three impulsive free-lancers, one of them a woman.  The most criminally inclined was William Mahan, also known as Swede Davis, and William Dainard, with a rap sheet of five bank robberies, including a $ 100,000 heist in Idaho.  He had just served a term in prison for bank robbery.<br>
<br>
The woman was a somewhat pretty and placid 19-year-old blonde named Margaret Thulin, who had met and married a tall, handsome 24-year-old loser named Harmon Waley, a native of Hoquiam and the third kidnapper.  Margaret was from Salt Lake City.  Waley had been in and out of reformatories and jails since he was 17 years old, mostly fighting and drunkenness.  He was by no means a hardened criminal, not in the same league with Mahan, a committed tough guy.  Harmon Waley was dumber than a box of rocks.  His bride was similarly endowed.<br>
<br>
That first evening in captivity, George was released from his pit and everyone had a picnic dinner of sandwiches, cookies and hard-boiled eggs.  Then George was put back in the pit, hand cuffed again, with two blankets and a kerosene lantern.<br>
<br>
Cops and G-men indicated this was a carefully researched snatch, as much as three years in the planning by resourceful and experienced criminal minds.  Actually, the trio plotted the kidnapping rather impulsively.  The three of them were living in Spokane when Margaret happened to read the obituary of John Philip Weyerhaeuser Sr., George's grandfather.  
The obituary dwelt at some length on the family's wealth.  Within three days, Mahan and Waley were casing George's movements as he went to and from school.  The precise time of his capture was an accident.  They were merely checking out his movements when George emerged from the Tennis Club grounds.<br>
<br>
"Where is Stadium Way?" one of the men asked.<br>
<br>
The little boy moved closer to the men in the car in order to answer.  One of the men grabbed George, shoved him down on the rear floor of the sedan and told him to keep quiet.  In a matter of minutes, the kidnappers made their way out of the city.<br>
Insofar as the kidnappers had any, Mahan was the trio's brains.<br>
<br>
He was the leader, who dominated Waley and his wife; he was the author of the 21 -point ransom letter, a lengthy document that would have earned, perhaps, a C-minus as a grammar school essay.  By now, of course, the police had been alerted to George's disappearance, so Mahan's instructions not to call in the law was already breached.  George's father, Philip Weyerhaeuser, got the money together and placed his ad in the P.I.<br>
<br>
Then he added another note: "Due to publicity beyond our control please indicate another method of reaching you.  Hurry.  Percy Minnie."<br>
<br>
George was removed from his pit and taken farther into the woods and entombed in another hole the kidnappers had dug for emergencies.  He was chained there for a night and a day.  Then the boy was taken out and locked in the trunk of Mahan's car.  Holes had been punched in the trunk so George wouldn't suffocate, and he was driven that night clear across the state, some 300 miles, to Spokane.  In those days, this would have been a hard trip for a child even if he had been riding in a comfortable seat next to the driver.<br>
<br>
George did not complain.  He was quiet and he didn't cry.  Mahan sometimes jerked him about, but Waley would intervene.  They hand cuffed George to a tree near the Washington-Idaho border; he was left there a full day while the kidnappers went into Spokane.  They came back that night with a large Uneeda cracker carton.  The kidnappers packed George into the box and took him to a house they had rented in Spokane.<br>
<br>
Life became more comfortable for George.  He was locked in a closet in the two-bedroom house at 1509 W. 11 th Ave. The house was owned by the Rev.  Ella A. Evans, 78, an ordained minister of the Congregational Church.  George was shackled in the closet<B> </B>for three days and nights, although Harmon Waley, who watched over him, let the boy walk around freely at times and brought him hot
dogs and soft drinks.<br>
<br>
George was given a mattress to sleep on and Waley slept on another mattress outside the closet door.<br>
<br>
Mahan and Margaret raced to Seattle and set up residence at the Fir Apartments.  A second ransom note was sent, at which point the scheme took on elements of melodrama.  George's father was instructed to go to the Ambassador Hotel, register under the name Of James Paul Jones and await a telephone call.  It was not long in coming.  Philip Weyerhaeuser was told to drive to a point midway between Tacoma and Seattle.  As instructed, he found a stake with a cloth tied to it.  A can at the base of the stake held a note directing him to another stake on a dirt road off the highway.<br>
<br>
Philip Weyerhaeuser could not find the second stake.  About dawn he returned to the Ambassador Hotel.  Another phone call came.  "Go home and send somebody else with the money," he was told.<br>
<br>
This time George's uncle, F. Rodman Titcomb, was dispatched to the Ambassador, and from there, by phone, he was sent to a place near the Half Way House, a well-known spot where the Seattle-Tacoma Airport now stands.  Titcomb found the stake with a note in a can.  The message directed him to a road that bypassed nearby Angle Lake.  A second stake and a second note were there.<br>
<br>
Titcomb was told to turn on the dome light of his car.  He was to put the suitcase with $200,000 cash on the front seat.  He was to leave the engine running leave the car and walk down the dark road.<br>
<br>
Mahan and Margaret were parked close by. Mahan  piled into Titcomb's car, drove to a shack he had rented on the edge of Seattle and hid the $200,000.  He left Titcomb's car on a side street.  Margaret drove Mahan's car back to the Fir Apartments; Mahan then retrieved his car and was on his way back to Spokane, even as Titcomb still was walking on a dark road back to town.<br>
<br>
Days had passed; George and Waley were getting along nicely.  Waley, wearing a hood as a disguise, gave George food and treats, let him walk freely in the house and entertained him, presumably, by playing a ukelele.  Waley even gave George newspaper accounts to read about his own kidnapping.  Harmon may have been big and stupid, but he was not cruel, unless you count the ukelele.<br>
When Mahan arrived, George again was packed into the car's trunk and taken back to Seattle.<br>
<br>
Now it was night again' Mahan and Harmon picked up Margaret at the
Fir Apartments, drove out to the shack, divided the ransom money and put Margaret on a train to Salt Lake City.  Then the men left the city, with George still locked in the trunk.  By now it was only a few hours before dawn.  They stopped the car on a lonely road near Issaquah.<br>
<br>
They got George out of the trunk and one of them told him: "Just walk down this road.  Pretty soon your father win come along and give you a ride home.  You don't have to be afraid of anything, even if it is dark. just keep walking this way and you'll get home.  " There was a pause, then: "You've been a very fine boy."<br>
They gave George two blankets and one dollar.  The nine-year-old boy was free.<br>
<br>
George had been in captivity for eight days. Northwest readers of newspapers were given some lurid headlines to feast upon.  "Posses Speed Kidnap Chase!" cried one.  "'Clues Point to Kidnappers, Olympic wilds Hideout" was another.  The Karpis gang, out of the midwest, got a persistent press: "Karpis Mobsters Linked to Crime." Pictures of George were frequent, and one story was headed: "Boy's Radiant, Sunny Smile Would Melt'Heart of Stone.'" "Call Off G-Men Is Gangsters' Demand."<br>
<br>
The nation's top cop, J. Edgar Hoover, was in good form. -"It may be a day.  It may be a week.  It may be years before we capture the kidnappers.  But we are going to capture them.  The long grind has begun," he told the wire services.<br>
<br>
Elsie Robinson, a writer known for her magazine fiction, came to Tacoma and set up shop, accompanied by her husband and her secretary.  Babette Hughes, the wife of Glenn Hughes, who was head of the University of Washington Drama Department, wrote articles speculating on the kidnapping's solution.  The Seattle Times reported the arrival of two New York journalists, elegantly dressed and wearing spats.<br>
<br>
Newsreel crews, syndicate writers, local reporters, photographers, radio people and curious onlookers virtually surrounded the Weyerhaeuser residence.  Seattle and Tacoma police were deluged with calls from all over the nation, mostly from people giving advice on how to trap kidnappers.<br>
<br>
While all this was going on, a small, quiet man named Johnny Dreher was working at the Seattle Times.  He was a golf writer.<br>
Among the Fourth Estate's firmanent of stars assigned to the Weyerhaeuser boy's disappearance, the name of Johnny Dreher was least known.  In addition to covering club golf matches, Johnny also wrote about trapshooting and sailing.  He was 59 years old, settling into a groove of near-retirement.  Johnny Dreher never
<br>
was assigned the big team sports, like Washington Husky football or Seattle Indians baseball.<br>
<br>
Frequently, on his own, he would arrive at the Times' sports department as early as 5 a.m. He would handle some early copy, then lean back in his chair, place a newspaper over his face, and await the regulars, who came in at 7.<br>
<br>
The sports editor was George M. Varnell, a towering figure at the Times.  The paper's city editor was a tough martinet named Ray Felton.  The Times' star reporter was Douglass Welch, later of the P-I, who became a nationally syndicated humorist.  It was said<br>
that Felton fired Welch several times a month, but each morning after being fired, Welch would be back on the job.  He never took the firings seriously.<br>
<br>
Among the Times'goodly supply of veteran reporters were a couple of young hands, Henry MacLeod, who later would become managing editor, and Vince O'Keefe, a copy boy, who became a top sports reporter and desk man.<br>
<br>
Johnny Dreher was a good golf writer, his job was secure, and he enjoyed needling George Varnell.  Now and then he would lean back into his chair, a newspaper over his face, and say to Varnell, "I know you're watching me, George.  I'm just resting." Or he would counsel young reporters: "You guys are too afraid of Varnell.  Don't be afraid of him.  He's just a big bag of wind." Everybody liked Johnny Dreher, even Varnell.<br>
<br>
During the period  of George Weyerhaeuser's disappearance, the byline of Johnny Dreher would appear among the dozens of kidnap stories.  This was because Dreher had a private fixation on crime-he liked to read about it in True Detective magazine, in Black Mask, or in any of a dozen pulp magazines that were popular in those days.  In his leisure time he wrote similar stories himself, being an old police reporter.  So Times editors let Johnny Dreher out of the office so he could journey to Tacoma and tum in pieces about the Weyerhaeuser crime.<br>
<br>
It was early on Saturday morning, June 1, that the kidnappers advised little George Weyerhaeuser that he had been a fine boy, turned him loose and told him to begin walking down the dark road.<br>
Saturday was a big day at the Times because that was when everybody put together the Sunday paper.<br>
<br>
Johnny Dreher was confined to office work that day because there were no gaff matches worth covering, except by telephone. Dreher was alone in the office when the telephone rang.  The caller said he'd received a tip that the Weyerhaeuser boy had been turned
loose somewhere near Issaquah.  Dreher received another call from the Associated Press saying the same thing.<br>
<br>
Dreher had a hunch.  "It was one of those hunches that come like a royal flush," he said later.  Johnny caged a taxicab, which happened to be driven by a man named Earl Robinson.<br>
<br>
George Weyerhaeuser was still walking down the road when it began to rain.  He was not frightened in the darkness, but his blanket was damp and his feet were wet. About daylight he came upon a shingled house back from the road a bit and on a grassy knoll.  It was the house of John Bonifas, a stump farmer.  Mrs. Bonifas was preparing breakfast for her husband and four children.  George went around in back and knocked on the kitchen door.<br>
<br>
When Mrs. Bonifas opened the door, she saw this bedraggled kid standing there.<br>
<br>
"I'm the little boy who was kidnapped,," George said.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Bonifas hurried George inside.  She took off his wet shoes and hung his socks by the stove to dry.  She fitted him with a pair of dry shoes that belonged to her daughter.  George sat at the table and had his breakfast with the Bonifas family.<br>
<br>
Afterward, John Bonifas put George in the front seat of his old Model T Ford and began driving along the road that led to Tacoma.<br>
Dreher's taxicab passed them going the other way.  "That's the boy, that's the boy," Johnny said.  "Turn around and catch them."<br>
<br>
In a few minutes, Earl Robinson pulled his cab alongside Bonifas and signaled him to stop.  George was transferred from the car to Dreher's taxicab, much to the relief, it seemed, of John Bonifas.  All John Bonifas said was, "I'll take my little girl's shoes back now."<br>
<br>
"Stay away from cars and stay away from people," Dreher told Robinson.  He placed George on the back scat, told him to keep down, then covered him with his blanket.  Johnny Dreher then settled on the rear floor of the taxicab, pencil and notebook on his lap.  He was now developing the biggest newspaper scoop in America.<br>
<br>
George told it all.  He talked about Waley and Mahan, who wore masks during most of his captivity. He talked about the pits and the shackles and about the long rides in the trunk of the tan Buick.  He was never really afraid, George said, except for that time when they passed a river in the woods.  "You aren't going to throw me in and drown me, are you? " George asked them.  They hurt
him only once, he said, and that was by accident, when they pulled him out of the car's trunk.<br>
<br>
Much of the time, George said, he was blindfolded.  He never knew where he was.  Once they told him he was near Aberdeen.  On another occasion, they told him he was in Oregon.  He never knew that he had been in Spokane.  Dreher took copious notes as George talked on.<br>
<br>
Once George paused and said, "Mister ... ? Mister ... ?" "It's Dreher," Johnny said, "pronounced like prayer."<br>
The cab finally reached the Weyerhaeuser mansion overlooking Commencement Bay.  Earl Robinson drove his taxicab past the onlookers, the press watchdogs and the photographers.  Johnny Dreher took George out of the taxicab and led him up the stairs to the mansion's front door.<br>
<br>
The door was opened by a family friend, Marfield Bascom, and Dreher brightened.  Bascom, it happened, was a golfing pal and surely, Dreher thought, he would be asked inside and thanked profusely for bringing the boy home.  Instead, Bascom pushed Dreher in the face, pulled George inside and slammed the door.  Johnny Dreher never saw little George Weyerhaeuser again.<br>
<br>
His feelings somewhat bruised, Dreher got back in his taxicab and headed for Seattle.  On the way, he stopped to telephone the Times that he had picked  up the Weyerhaeuser boy and would be in to write his story.  When the Times'golf writer finally arrived in the newsroom, Col.  Clarence B. Blethen, the paper's boisterous, colorful, sometimes obstreperous publisher, was beside himself with joy.<br>
<br>
His paper, to be sure, had scored an exclusive that dwarfed anything done by the Eastern press and, on this Sunday, it would smother the rival morning P-I, owned by the hated William Randolph Hearst, with an exclusive, first hand account of the kidnapped boy's safe return to his family.  Ray Felton, the gifted terrorist of the newsroom, hovered over Johnny Dreher and his typewriter, not as a martinet but as a kindly cohort.<br>
<br>
By now the presses were rolling.<br>
<br>
Dreher's dramatic account was sent in short takes, sometimes only a paragraph in length, sometimes just a sentence, and it would go out to the composing room slugged " 18th add Dreher, if and "28th add Dreher, more to cum" and finally on up to "40th add Dreher." It was
a story full of juice and drama; there was sentiment in it, too, as Johnny Dreher wrote about how he had hugged the Weyerhaeuser boy and kissed him on the cheek.  The Times even featured a story on Earl Robinson, the cab driver.  It carried a deep, two-column picture of balding Johnny Dreher.<br>
<br>
By mid afternoon the word was out that Johnny Dreher, the little gaff writer, was journalism's national hero.  Congratulatory calls came from all over America, some from well-known newspaper editors, and the telegrams added up to hundreds.  Finally, the Times' switchboard operator had to take a break; she burst into the sports department and commandeered Johnny Dreher's chair, and said, "I'll bet he hugged and kissed George, too-the old sentimentalist!" She was Mary Louise Dreher, Johnny's daughter.<br>
<br>
It is said that Col.  Clarence B. Blethen gave Dreher a bonus on the spot, but nobody remembers that.  What they do remember is that the colonel made Dreher the gift of a trip, an all-expenses journey back east to cover the U.S. Open Golf Tournament that summer.  This was in itself fairly big news, at least in Seattle.  In those Depression days, no editor or publisher in his right mind would finance a golf trip as far away as Everett.<br>
<br>
It seems so long ago now, when Tubby Graves waved his bat in front of us kids and said, "If you want to hit the Weyerhaeuser kidnapper in the belly, you do it like this .... " I did not know Johnny Dreher, being too young at the time, although I did once work for Henry MacLeod and became a good friend and colleague of<br>
Vince  O'Keefe.  About  a  year  after  his  brief,  shining   so<br>
moment in journalism, Johnny Dreher died.  It is safe to say that few who work at the Times today ever heard of him.<br>

LOG POACHING<br>
<br>
Murray C. Morgan, "Log poaching," <B>The Last Wilderness,</B> New York: The Viking Press, 1955, p. 239-242.<br>
<br>
On an evening your host may suggest a midnight stroll along the beach, not just for the beauty, which is great, but for treasure.  Beach dwellers take everlasting delight in going out to see what the tide has brought them.  It may be a green float pulled from the net of a Japanese fisherman five thousand miles away; an empty wine bottle from the Greek freighter that passed during the afternoon, outbound for India with a load of wheat; a bit of frayed rope; a serviceable broom; a three-sided picture frame; or a lily-pad, the butt end trimmed from a peeler log at some plywood mill.  Sometimes there is a log rolled up on the beach like a stranded whale.<br>
<br>
A log can mean a night's work, for although anyone who lives on a beach considers anything that washes up on the beach to be his, by the divine right of beach dwellers-and anything that washes on a neighbor's beach to be his too, if the neighbor is not home-the law holds that a log belongs to the man whose brand is upon it.<br>
<br>
So the very least a beach dweller can do with a gift from the tidal gods is to deface <B>the log</B> with a few strokes of an ax.<br>
<br>
It is wiser to get out the cross-cut and saw the branded end clear off.  Even after these elementary precautions have been taken, the log is still subject to seizure by the log patrol, so it is best to float it to some nearby cove where it can be hidden for later delivery to a friendly millowner, who will pay half the going rate, log scale.<br>
<br>
If the log is red cedar a beach man can handle it himself with wedge and saw and froe.  He drives the wedges into the log until it splits along the grain.  When the log is broken into bolts, the bolts are cut into two-foot lengths.  Then, using the froe, a heavy blade fourteen to twenty inches long and about three inches wide, he splits the bolts down the grain into heavy, rough shingles, known as shakes.  They last forever, and there is always a market for them.<br>
<br>
Most log-pirating on the peninsula is carried on in this casual way-but not all.  Mill owners and towboat people don't object much to Iosing an occasional log, but they are opposed loudly and earnestly and in every session of the state legislature to losing logs by the raftful.  A boom of logs is worth tens of thousands of dollars.  Rough water may cause a few Iogs to leap over the boom-sticks, but the real danger is that a chain will break, spilling a whole section.

Back in the <B>1920s, </B>when log-pirating was best organized, the rustlers were not content with picking up stray sticks.  They made certain that spills would occur.  Sometimes they sawed a boom-stick almost in two, or filed the hnk chains so that rough water, or even a change in the tide, assured a break-up.  Tug skippers were bribed to spill their loads in convenient spots.  Log piracy reached its peak when an offduty bootlegger got a Canadian watchman drunk in a rafting cove on Vancouver Island, hitched a towboat to a huge boom, and headed south into American waters.<br>
<br>
Finally the Washington State Legislature passed an act to protect the title of the owners of floating logs, timber, and lumber." It established the branding system for logs; they are branded with a stamping ax.  It also gave log owners the right to pursue their logs onto private property, and it established the legal basis for the operation of the log patrol.<br>
<br>

The patrol began in <B>1928 </B>as a sort of floating vigilance committee, organized and financed by some of the bigger companies to discourage pirating.  W. E. (Ed) Craw, a former Everett police captain, was the chief of the patrol.  He was deputized in a half-dozen counties and rode his range in a fast motorboat.  He sent a number of pirates to jail, but it was probably the depression that broke up the pirates' operations.  Nobody could sell logs in those days.<br>
<br>
During the early 1930s the log-patrol men took on the duties of aquatic cowboys.  They rounded up strays and herded them back to their owners.  With the coming of the war logs became valuable again.<br>
<br>
A few waterfront men had noted that there was nothing in the law to prevent a private citizen from organizing his own log patrol, even if he had no logs to patrol.  Soon a dozen or more log patrols were scouting for other people's logs.  Lumbermen complained that it was hard to tell a patrolman from a pirate.  A spokesman for the big companies complained to the state legislature that "it has become a case of every pirate being his own watchman."<br>
<br>
The private log-patrol operators hired a lobbyist, and he told the legislators that logs were needed for the war effort, that the sale of salvaged logs was conducted under state regulations, and that brand-owners got part of the money paid for their logs.  The patrols continue to operate.<br>
<br>
My favorite log-patrol man was Frank Butts, the carefree captain of the Brant.  When I knew Butts, in 1949, he was <B>living</B> aboard a
patrol boat with his wife and their two young children.  It was a good life.  When the Brant left her moorage on the Duwamish River in Seattle and glided past Harbor Island into Puget Sound, Butts seldom knew where he was headed.  "We just follow the logs," he said.  But as often as not be wound up coasting the shore of the peninsula.<br>
<br>
Butts cruised close to the beach, watching for logs on the sand.  When be saw one, if the tide was bigh, be nosed the boat ashore.<br>
<br>
The Brant barely drew a glass of water forward, though she needed five feet astern.  When the prow hit sand Butts would jump ashore while his wife, Margaret, took over the controls.  Margaret's job was to see that the boat did not get "in irons"-that is, drift sideways to the shore.  Butts would dig a hole under the inshore end of the log and slip a choker around it.  Back in the cabin, he would throw the Brant into reverse.  The line snapped taut, and the log charged across the beach and into the water.<br>
<br>
At the end of a day's search for sticks Butts ran the Brant into one of the tiny coves that pocket the peninsula.  He had no favorite among them.  "You always think the one you're in is the best place on earth." If he got as far north as the San Juans, where there are few logs but wonderful swimming beaches and fine people, Butts was likely to knock off for a week.  Then, to make up for lost log-gathering time, he would visit the Dungeness spit, which catches more logs per frontal foot than any other stretch of shore known to beachcombers.<br>
<br>
After rounding up a satisfactory show of logs, Butts hauled them back to the patrol moorage in Seattle.  The operator who owned the boat would pay him $17.50 a thousand feet for the logs he retrieved.  He was a happy man.  I've lost track of him, but I like to think of him, roaming the sound.<br>
<br>

Log-patrolling is one thing, and log-poaching is quite an<B>other. </B>A poacher goes into someone else's stumpage and starts cutting.  Usually a poacher trucks the logs out to a mill, though some operators have been known to bring in portable sawmills and saw lumber on the spot.  Lumber-poaching suits are frequent in superior court in western Washington.<br>
<br>
The boldest poachers invade the National Forests.  In the old days this activity was considered just part of the lumber business, but the old order changeth, and now the poacher must worry not only about the Forest Service rangers but about the F. B. I.<br>
<br>

One night in January of 1954 a man noticed lights flickering on a hillside behind his home.  It was in a National Forest, and he knew there was a fire-lookout station on the hill.  But what was anyone doing watching for forest fires in January? He phoned a forest ranger friend to find out.  The ranger said there was no one in the station as far as he knew, but he'd go check.  He found that eleven trees had been cut, two of them within recent hours.<br>
<br>
The rangers checked the back roads and came on a logging truck with two logs.  The driver said the sticks had been taken on a pulp-company tract near the National Forest.  The rangers let the driver go on, but they followed the road to the pulp-company land and found it blocked with a windfall.  The rangers called the F. B. I.<br>
<br>
Special Agent Will Ralston was assigned to the case.  It was a bit out of his line, but he decided to follow the usual procedures.  He went with the rangers to the scene of the crime.  There he singled out the two freshest cuts and had rounds sawed from the stumps.<br>
<br>
These rounds, each about a foot thick and four feet in diameter, wbre tagged and taken to the Tacoma F, B. I. office.<br>
<br>
Ralston and the rangers went to the log dump where the truck-driver sold his logs.  They asked the scaler to locate the two the driver had brought in.  The logs were hauled from the water, and the butt ends were cut off.<br>
<br>
Then the driver was picked up.  He denied everything.  Ralston showed him how the butt ends of his logs fitted the rounds from the stumps taken in the National Forest.  The driver confessed and later pleaded guilty in federal court to stealing government property.<br>
<br>
He was fined one thousand dollars and ordered to pay four thousand dollars in restitution for the stolen logs.<br>
<br>
In the old days on Puget Sound a similar bit of detective work might have disrupted an industry.<br>

Murray C. Morgan, "Boom days of Puget Sound pirates ended by log patrol," <B>The Tacoma News Tribune.</B> February 3, 1994, p. 12.<br>
<br>
Legend has it that the greatest act of log Piracy on Pacific<br>
Northwest waters occurred in 1920.<br>
<br>
A tug with the name "Daisy Ann" freshly painted on its prow<br>
and stern pulled into a cove on the Fraser River delta where a<br>
million board feet of Douglas fir logs were rafted up into booms<br>
awaiting tow to mill.<br>
The alleged "Daisy Ann" hove to off the boathouse. The crew<br>
chatted with the boom watchman, asking him about tide, current and<br>
the channel upstream to Mission City. They thanked him for guidance<br>
with a snort from a bottle, followed that offering with the rest of<br>
the bottle, accepted his invitation to visit the boomhouse and<br>
handed him a fresh bottle. In the dead of night, they left the cove<br>
with the log boom in tow and are thought to have headed for Puget<br>
Sound.<br>
<br>
No court records have surfaced showing that anyone was ever<br>
charged, let alone prosecuted, for the piracy act. The authenticity<br>
of the report has been questioned over the years.<br>
<br>
But real log piracy was prevalent enough to cause the<br>
Washington Legislature to pass what became known as Chapter 154 -<br>
"An act to protect the title of the of the owners of floating logs,<br>
timber and lumber."<br>
<br>
Chapter 154 set up a system under which logs were branded<br>
like cattle. They were struck on the butt not with a hot iron but<br>
with a branding sledge that had the owner's copyrighted mark on its<br>
head.<br>
<br>
Owners were given the legal right to pursue logs onto private<br>
property. But chasing lost logs took time, and owners found it<br>
unprofitable to maintain search boats. So, in 1928, a group of them<br>
banded together to finance the Washington Log Patrol. Part of its<br>
assignment was to keep poachers from precipitating spills by<br>
sabotaging the boom-log pens that kept loose logs confined while<br>
under tow. But the patrol also retrieved floating and beached<br>
strays.<br>
<br>
Complaints about piracy declined after the log patrol hit the<br>
water. Some observers attributed the drop to the plunge in log<br>
prices during the 1930s Depression.<br>
<br>
With World War II, logs became valuable again, but manpower<br>
was short and wages were high. Log larceny continued to languish.<br>
The Patrol spent most of its time retrieving floaters or beached<br>
logs. With peace, demobilization and log prices still high, the<br>
Patrol activity increased.<br>
<br>
Then someone noticed that Chapter 154 did not give mill<br>
owners exclusive rights to log patrol work. Private citizens could
round up strays on their own and return them to the owners. Soon a<br>
dozen or more free-lance patrol boats were roaming Puget sound in<br>
search of runaway fir, hemlock and cedar. The going price for<br>
returned branded logs averaged $17.50 a thousand board feet.<br>
<br>
I remember writing a story for Argosy magazine about a trip<br>
on one of the free-lance boats, the Brant. It was operated by Frank<br>
Butts, who lived aboard with his wife and two children.<br>
<br>
When the Brant left its moorage on the Duwamish and glided<br>
past Harbor Island, Butts seldom knew where he might go.<br>
<br>
"I just head where I feel logs," he said as he turned toward<br>
Vashon Island.<br>
<br>
We followed the west shore of Colvos Passage. When he saw a<br>
log on the beach he nosed ashore. The Brant barely drew a glass of<br>
water forward though she needed five feet astern. When the prow<br>
grounded Butts jumped ashore and his wife, Margaret, took over the<br>
controls. Her job was to see the boat didn't get "in irons" - that<br>
is, drift sideways ashore. Frank would dig a hole under the inshore<br>
end of the log and slip a choker around it. Back aboard he would<br>
throw the Brant into reverse. The line snapped taut and the log<br>
charged across the beach and into the water.<br>
<br>
It was useful work and Butts was happy at it. But beach<br>
owners were unhappy about his retrieval service. They looked on the<br>
patrol boats as pillagers.<br>
<br>
People who live on beaches consider anything that washes up<br>
to be theirs by the divine right of beach dwelling - and anything<br>
that washes up on a neighbor's beach too, be the neighbor not at<br>
home.<br>
<br>
Tension between the patrols and property owners never<br>
reached violence and gradually receded as loggers chased the forest<br>
farther back into the hills and trucks took over as the prime<br>
movers.<br>
<br>
No one declared the log patrols an endangered species. They<br>
simply disappeared - along with the pirates.<br>

Herbert Hunt, "Judge Lynch in old Tacoma," <B>History of Tacoma.</B> Chicago: S.J.Clarke, 1916.<br>
<br>
Judge Lynch held brutal court in Old Tacoma April 27, 1873.  It was on Sunday, and the convict was a half-breed Indian Jim Shell.  At 2 o'clock on that Sunday -morning the Indian killed Louis Moroe, or Morris, a Canadian half-breed, at the resort of a man named McKay.  The murder took place while a lively dance was in progress in the Craig & Cosgrove Hall.<br>
<br>
Shell walked up behind Moroe and with a hatchet almost cut off his head.  The murderer was taken into custody at once and locked up in one of the rooms of the Craig & Cosgrove salooN building.  Sheriff Davisson at Steilacoom was notified and he sent two deputies after the prisoner in the afternoon.  As they were taking the Indian out of the building a crowd seized him and forced the deputies back into the building.<br>
<br>
There they were kept while the mob removed the Indian about sixty feet away where a rope was thrown over a stump and the wretch was slowly strangled.  The members of the mob at once dispersed and the village soon was as quiet as usual.  Indians cut down the corpse of the dead man and removed it to Brown's Point where it was buried.<br>
<br>
Shell killed Morris after a quarrel over an Indian woman known as "Soldier Sal." Jealousy over her affections had caused two other killings, one in the woods near Fort Steilacoom, and the other in the swale back of the new railroad station.  This spot in the early days was a well-known Indian camping place.  Both of the Steilacoom victims were soldiers.<br>
<br>
A farcical investigation of the Shell lynching followed, but no one was punished.  The deputies whom the sheriff sent after the prisoner are said to have made little or no effort to save his life.<br>
<br>
The Steilacoom paper devoted less than a half column to the tragedy and treated it in a humorous manner.  No further mention was made of it until May 8, when this paragraph appeared:<br>
<br>
"There couldn't have been very many people at Tacoma on Saturday, judging from the large number visiting our city that day.  They all told the same story, and in certain cases believe in capital punishment."<br>
<br>
Nothing further was heard of the case.<br>

<br>
In the early '60s the officers at Fort Steilacoom had a Chinese cook who sometimes visited Steilacoom town, and paid his genial respects to the Indian shacks along the waterfront.  One night he was murdered, about where the new Northern Pacific station now stands, and robbed of about $50.  A fourteen-year-old Indian girl revealed the murderer to the vigilance committee, and he was taken promptly to a carpenter shop for trial,<br>
<br>
Doctor Webber presiding, before a jury chosen on the spot.  Stephen Judson was the interpreter.  He asked the Indian if he had killed the man and why.  The Indian admitted the crime and said he wanted the Chinaman's money.  The hearing lasted only a few minutes and a verdict of death was ruturned by the jury without the formality of leaving the shop.<br>
<br>
It was decided to have another Chinaman, a friend of the dead man, as executioner, a commission which he accepted with smiling felicity.  A long, heavy plank was run out over the bluff just back of the old Masonic hall.  The land end was well weighted down with a log, and a few of the vigilantes stood upon it for its additional security.<br>
<br>
The wretched Indian stood on the outer end of the plank, rope about his neck, and the other end tied to the plank at his feet.  When all was ready Doctor Webber said: "Now, boys, it's all understood that we have nothing to do with this-the Chinaman is doing it all."<br>
<br>
The sign was  given  and  the  Chinaman  pushed  the  murderer<br>
from the plank.  Many Indians saw the execution from their shacks along the beach.  The community regarded it as a much needed lesson for them.<br>

<br>
Leland Athow, "A brief history of the Adam Byrd branch of the Byrd family.<br>
<br>
A tragedy that marred the early history of Washington was the death of Andrew F. Byrd, January 22, 1863. Andrew Byrd, who operated a saw mill, a grist mill and a slaughter house near the source of Chambers Creek, was a man of sterling character and enjoyed the highest esteem of all decent and respectable citizens of the county. Being a public spirited man, he spared no effort in promoting the school, library, Masonic Lodge, roads and other activities that benefitted the community.<br>
<br>
J.M. Bates, who was regarded as a half-wit, lost a cow, and an enemy of Byrd told Bates that Byrd had stolen it and the head was in Byrd's slaughter house. Byrd assured Bates he had not seen the cow, even went so far as to tell Bates to go himself to the slaughter house to see. The enemy would not let the affair drop, but kept right at Bates.<br>
<br>
On January 21, 1863, Andrew Byrd went to Steilacoom, about a mile from his home, and upon entering the post office was fired upon by Bates who had been waiting for him. The details are fairly well told in accounts of the shooting published in the Puget Sound Herald. In the issue of January 22, 1863, was the following:<br>
<br>
"Yesterday about one o'clock p.m. was perpetuated another diabolic attempt at murder, this time in our own town, in the presence of several witnesses. One of our most sterling and inoffensive citizens, Mr. Andrew F. Byrd, on this occasion was the victim.<br>
<br>
"At about the hour indicated, Mr. Byrd entered the post office on business and had barely time to seat himself before J. M. Bates, with whom he had some weeks previously had a slight controversy respecting some lost cattle, opened the door, stepped over the threshold, and deliberately shot him; the ball entering the side and remaining in the body.<br>
<br>
"The wounded man was immediately removed to Galliher's hotel, and Bates at once taken into custody, declaring that he wanted to kill another man, (Dr. Spinning) and then he would be ready to expiate his crimes on the gallows. Bates is now in jail awaiting the result of the wound.<br>
<br>
"At the time of his removal, it was generally supposed the shot would prove fatal, and that Mr. Byrd could not survive more than one or two hours. Dr. Steinberger, the garrison surgeon, who instantly responded to the summons upon  him, gave it as his opinion that if Mr. Byrd survived till morning, he would ultimately recover.<br>
<br>
"This morning we are happy to say, he was pronounced much better,
and his friends were hopeful of his recovery; but his condition was still very precarious.<br>
<br>
"Much feeling was manifested by the citizens during last evening, and a strong disposition prevailed to hang Bates without delay. If Mr. Byrd had died during the night there is little doubt that Bates would have been hung immediately afterwards. As we go to press, the excitement is subsiding and the prospects of the recovery of Mr. Byrd are improving."<br>
<br>
The Puget Sound Herald, Steilacoom, Washington Territory, January 29, 1863, published under the head "The Murder," the following:<br>
<br>
"Amid the excitement and confusion consequent upon the murder of the lamented Andrew F. Byrd, added to the short interval between that event and the issue of our paper of the 22nd instant, it was almost impossible to make up a correct circumstantial account of the sad affair. As usual, on such occasions, there was a variety of versions, no two of which could be reconciled with a strict regard to the truth, with the perfactory remark that the event originated in an utterly unfounded charge by Bates, that Byrd had killed his (Bates's) cattle, we proceed to give the facts attending to the murder.<br>
<br>
"It seems that Bates, several days before the commission of the act, made threat indicative of his purpose, but they were unheeded for the reason that he was not thought capable of perpetrating so great a crime.<br>
<br>
"Unhappily he was too seriously in earnest. For nearly three days, from early morning each day, he patiently awaited the coming of his victim in the post office, which place he knew Byrd visited every time he came to town.<br>
<br>
"At about one o'clock on Wednesday, 21st instant, Mr. Byrd, as was his wont, all unsuspicious of a lurking foe, lying in wait for his life, entered the post office; but scarcely had he taken the third step within the door when he received his death wound, followed an instant afterwards, as he turned to escape, by a second shot which struck him in the leg.<br>
<br>
"Not content with this, the murderer was proceeding to discharge the third shot at him, but his pistol would not revolve; the last exploding cap having lodged between the hammer and revolving barrels and stopped it.<br>
<br>
"Meanwhile Mr. Byrd ran out into the street and on the wharf, where he fell into the arms of Mr. Hanselman, who covered the wounded man's person with his own body as Bates approached to shoot the third time. Immediately hereupon, before he could fire again, Bates was taken into custody; remarking as he was so, that he wanted to kill Dr. Spinning, and then he was ready to hang.<br>
<br>
"These are the facts as we have them from Messrs. Munson and
Hanselman; the first named being inside the post office at the time, and the latter about to enter. There were one or two other witnesses of the act, but they witnessed nothing in addition to what is above stated.<br>
<br>
"In justice to Dr. Steinberger, we should here state that we were misinformed respecting his opinion of the nature of the wounds. We have since been assured that he entertained no hope at any time of Mr. Byrd's recovery; he considered the first wound mortal as soon as he examined it.<br>
<br>
"Nevertheless he was assiduous in his attention; remaining all Wednesday night with Mr. Byrd, and devoting all the skill of which he is master to the alleviation of his sufferings. This explanation is due to the Doctor's personal reputation."<br>
<br>
"End of the Tragedy" was another headline to an article in the January 29, 1863, issue of the Puget Sound Herald which was as follows.<br>
<br>
"We last week noticed briefly the beginning of the most thrilling tragedy that has yet taken place in this community. Now it becomes our painful duty to give the conclusion of the sad events. Mr. Andrew F. Byrd expired at about 10 o'clock on Thursday night, thus destroying the last hope indulged by his many friends and relatives.<br>
<br>
"From the moment at which Mr. Byrd received his fatal wound to that which terminated his life, a feeling of very anxious solicitude prevailed all minds. When death put an end to the painful suspense a single impulse inspired our citizens, with scarcely an exception, to hang the murderer with as little delay as possible.<br>
<br>
"As he had given his victim no warning of his hellish purpose, so a speedy retribution was deemed most in accordance with justice. Accordingly at an early hour on Friday morning, preparations were made for the closing scene in the tragedy.<br>
<br>
"With a coolness and deliberation credited to all concerned the people set about the necessary arrangements which were concluded at noon, shortly after which, to the number of about a hundred, and embracing the most worthy and responsible men of the county, they went in a body to the jail.<br>
<br>
"Arriving there, they first demanded admission, which the sheriff refused. Then with a sledge-hammer, axe, and crow-bar, they proceeded to force an entrance through the lower door. In this, after some delay, and much labor, they finally succeeded; after tearing off the jambs, the door was wrested from the hinges and fell outwards upon the ground.<br>
<br>
"Mr. Judson, the sheriff, here came in full view, having been supporting the door on the inside, and warned the people against further proceedings. On the attempt being made to enter, he
resisted; but he was soon over powered, and forcibly borne away by bystanders.<br>
<br>
"A single blow of the axe sufficed to break the lock which fastened the door on the cell, and the next moment Bates, the murderer was in the hands of his executioners, the neighbors, friends, and the avengers of the pure and good man he had slain.<br>
<br>
"On being asked if he had anything to say, or any dying request to make, he expressed a desire to see several persons not present. These were sent for, and, at the end of a quarter of an  hour, Mr.J.R. Meeker, one of the  persons he wished to see appeared.<br>
<br>
"To Mr. Meeker he expressed his last request; being instructions regarding disposition of his property and the internment of his body. An appropriate prayer was made by Rev. Sloan, and after being blind-folded, his body was suspended by the neck and his soul launched into eternity.<br>
<br>
"Several distinct contractions of the muscles, seen in the steady rising and falling of the body were the only visible symptoms of either life or pain until his pulse ceased to beat.<br>
<br>
"He persisted to the end in justifying the act for which he died; asserting that he did not regret it, and that he had sufficient cause for it. There were few or none present who did not have a better acquaintance with his victim than did Bates, and that acquaintance was of a character to discredit the assertion of Bates, that he had suffered wrong at the hands of Byrd.<br>
<br>
"So far as we can learn, the unfortunate man did not have a friend in the county, though he had lived here many years. His remains were buried on Sunday last, at a place indicated by him. He was from Bethel, Vermont, where his mother still lives. We did not learn his age, but judge he was twenty-eight or thirty years old."<br>
<br>
Another story under the title "Andrew F. Byrd" appeared in the Puget Sound Herald, Steilacoom, Washington Territory, January 29, 1863, as follows:<br>
<br>
"Andrew F. Byrd, so long and favorably known to the citizens of Pierce County and adjoining counties, came to his death on Thursday night, 22nd instant, from a wound inflicted by a pistol shot fired by J. B. Bates, on the 21st instant.<br>
<br>
"The lamented dead was born in Green County, in the State of Ohio and resided there until about five years of age; since which he has resided in the states of Missouri, Illinois, and Wisconsin as well as Washington Territory. In each of these places of abode numerous friends still live to mourn his  untimely death, and to shed a tear of sympathy with his bereaved relatives.<br>
<br>
"Mr. Byrd crossed the plains in the summer of 1852, and came to this county in March, 1853, and has been a resident here till the
time of his death. He had always enjoyed the esteem and confidence of the people of the county, and has been offered at different times almost every position of honor, profit, and trust within their gift but never accepted a public position until, July 1861, at which time his friends forced upon him the office of County Commissioner. This position he has filled with credit to himself and the benefit to his county. His term has not expired and his untimely death therefore leaves the office vacant.<br>
<br>
"Since he settled among us, the deceased has contributed largely toward the improvement of the county. A fine saw mill and flouring mill now stand at his place of abode, monuments of his industry and enterprise, to mournfully remind us of the departed.<br>
<br>
"There is hardly a citizen of the county who, at different times has not receive hospitality, kindness and assistance at his hands; aye, even his murderer has been the recipient of his generous bounty.<br>
<br>
"He was a dutiful son, a kind and generous brother, a devoted husband, and an affectionate father. He leaves behind him, to mourn his loss, an aged mother, who resided with him since he has been amongst us, and whose declining years  have been tenderly cared for by him; also a sister and six brothers, and a fond, inconsolable wife and three innocent little children.<br>
<br>
"But these are not the only mourners; all the citizens of heart and worth in the county mourn with them. He was the true friend of every man who merited his friendship, Never, since his residence among us, has the deceased been known to carry a deadly weapon. He has never been known to raise his hand or voice against anyone, but always had a kind word for and of every one; and when it was known that his wound had proved fatal--that his family and relatives and the community had lost him forever by so cowardly and treacherous an act as that which ended his life--the feeling was unanimous that his murderer should be punished.<br>
<br>
"This, the verdict of the people has been executed. Let this fearful loss of a good and generous friend and useful member of the community and the just but awful punishment of his murderer, be a lesson in the future to those who contemplate the commission of crime."<br>
<br>
The man who advised and encouraged Bates to commit the dastardly crime, lived to an extreme old age, and despite the fact that he gained a place of considerable prominence during his declining years, he was often seen in court and had a host of enemies even to his dying day.<br>
<br>
Andrew Byrd knew very well who the instigator of the crime was, yet as he lay in pain on his death bed, in a humble and forgiving manner he displayed neither malice nor revenge. So that the facts may be presented in the same spirit, the instigator will be referred to as Mr. X.
When the wife and relatives had gathered about the bedside of the wounded Byrd, he told them, "Mr. X is the cause of this, but always treat him well."<br>
<br>
One of those whom Bates had wished to see before he was hanged was Mr. X, but he had fled to Oregon.<br>
<br>
E.C. Meade, said, " I helped pull the rope that hanged Bates, but I rather would have had Mr. X on the other end."<br>
<br>
Mrs. McFarlane, daughter of Mrs. Andrew Byrd by a later marriage, said in an interview with the author (Leland Athow) that her mother had told the story to her many times.<br>
<br>
"Andrew went to town," she related, "and mother was so uneasy that she went several times to the gate to look. Finally she saw a man on horse back racing down the road. She was sure he had a message and ran to meet him. He said, 'Andrew has been shot and they are coming after you.' Andrew had been carried to Galliher's hotel and when she went to the bed side, he looked up at her and said, 'Mr. X has done this, but always treat him well.<br>
<br>
"In the excitement mother forgot Harvey, a three and one half year old asleep in bed, and neighbors who heard him cry took care of him."<br>

<br>
THE J M BATES LYNCHING<br>
<br>
(Erastus Light, "Early Times in Pierce County.").<br>
<br>
During the year 1863 Andrew Byrd was killed. A man by the name of Bates was around town and he had spent nearly all day behind the stove in my store. When it came time to close the store he went out, and the next morning he was on hand again and resumed his seat of the day before.<br>
<br>
I had noticed him and was a little suspicious but paid no particular attention. I had stepped out of the store for a short time and was busy when someone rushed out, calling to me that Byrd had been shot in the post office. I rushed to the scene but Bates had been taken care of and was safely behind the bars of the jail.<br>
<br>
Byrd had been shot in the lower part of the body near the groin. the wounds were pronounced fatal. Excitement was at its highest
pitch, and I could see an undercurrent of will and determination that meant business to the murderer if Byrd died.<br>
<br>
He lived a day or two, and as soon as his death became known the town was full of men, and it seemed that those living at a distance had got there as if by magic. They made their appearance in such a short time.<br>
<br>
The crowd assembled at Keach's store. I was sent for and requested to go to the jail and interview the murderer. I did so. The man denied that anyone was accessory to the crime, but that he had killed the man of his own free will, and had meditated the deed.  We returned to the place of the gathering and reported what the doomed man had said. They had a long rope, with a running noose, sledge hammers, picks, and crow bars.<br>
<br>
Keach spoke and said, " Boys, you know your duty."  They needed nothing further. They followed Keach to the jail. I followed after them. They commenced at the upper door. I had superintended the building of the jail and knew  something of its construction, and I told them if they were determined to go into the jail they had better enter by the lower door, at which they flew with their sledges and hammers, all to no avail.<br>
<br>
They grabbed up a large square piece of timber and used it as a battering ram, but the door stood fast. I told them the best way, and the way of the least damage was by removing the brick at each side of the door frame, which they did, and soon the door, frame and all was lifted out.<br>
<br>
The sheriff had placed inside one long, heavy, three inch plank, secured the other end to the floor and was standing on it.  the board came forward with a crash when the door was removed and some of the determined men barely escaped being caught beneath it.<br>
<br>
The sheriff was armed but he did not long remain so. The cell that contain the murderer was broken in to and he was dragged out, badly frightened. Someone cried out to give him a fair trial, whereupon I was appointed judge. I declined having anything to do with the matter, as he had acknowledge the crime, and the mob knew it.<br>
<br>
The man whispered to some one that he wanted to see old Mr. Meeker. A man was sent out on the road to watch for any soldiers that might come and another dispatched for Mr. Meeker, who refused to come. In the meantime the rope had been placed about the man's neck, and about one hundred men lay hold of it and he was led to a barn, from which protruded the end of a pole.<br>
<br>
Over this the rope was thrown and under it the man was placed, nearer dead than alive. He whispered to someone, for he could not speak audibly, that he wanted to see me. I went to him and took down his requests in a book, and, as I was soon afterward made probate judge, I saw all of them carried out.<br>

When he had finished speaking I said to the crowd that he had nothing more to say, and in a moment more his body was swinging in the air.  He showed no signs of life nor feeling after being lifted from the ground and he was let down a corpse.<br>
<br>
No one was ever punished for any part they took in this affair.<br>
<br>
(Erastus Light, "Early Times in Pierce County.")<br>

<br>
WILLIAM D. VAUGHN<br>
<br>
At the time (of Byrd's murder) I was living five miles from Steilacoom on my ranch. Mr. Berry, who had bought and lived on part of my place, came out from town one evening about sundown and told me that Byrd had been shot and Bates was guilty of the dastardly deed.  I tried to organize a company and go and hang Bates that night, but they would do nothing until morning.<br>
<br>
We all went to town the next morning and I called to see Byrd. He was still living, but was very weak. They would not allow me to speak to him, but to look at him strengthened the desire to see his slayer meet his just reward.<br>
<br>
I left the room with tears in my eyes for he had always been a good friend to me. I had bought cattle and lumber of him and had bought feed at his mill. I would sometimes tell him I did not have the money to pay for it, but he always said that made no difference, that I could have a thousand dollars worth if I wanted it.<br>
<br>
The more I thought of his untimely end, the worse I felt about it and I started out to get men to help swing Bates up. I found twenty men who agreed to hang him if Byrd died, but I wanted to string him up then for it was plain that his intentions were to kill Byrd on the spot.<br>
<br>
Byrd died at ten o'clock that night, and the next morning we adjourned to an old stable that stood near the jail. We put a pole out from the top of the stable on which was fastened a block and tackle. We took a big piece of timber which we used for a battering ram, and tried the jail door, but we could not gain access.<br>
<br>
Steven Judson was then the sheriff and he braced the door on the inside. Philip Keach had taken a new ax up with him and Thomas Headly took the ax and began to chop the door, but the door was so full of spikes that nothing was made by that effort.  I then took the ax and place in on the bolt which locked the door and told Headly to strike the ax with a sledge hammer which he did and the bolt was cut in two.<br>

M.J. West was picking a hole in the brick with a crowbar, but I told him we would get the door open. I took the crowbar and pried off the casting the door was bolted to and took the casing for a pry and broke it open.  The door fell out toward the men and Philip Keach had his army slightly hurt.<br>
<br>
H. D. Montgomery made a rush to go in past the sheriff but he pushed  him back. I then caught the sheriff by the arm and dragged him out of the door, down the steps to the ground and B. Dolbear got him by the arm and we held him and the others rushed inside the jail.<br>
<br>
I was going to let the sheriff go, but the men told us to hold on to him and take him down town for they meant to hang Bates. While we were at work trying to get into the jail two layers were on hand and they told us we would have to suffer for it.<br>
<br>
While we kept the sheriff down town, the other men strung Bates up. When there were about to hand him, he said he wanted to see old man Meeker, and tell him what to do with his property.<br>
<br>
He said he was willing to die if he could kill Dr. Springs and Montgomery, brother-in-law of Erastus Light and after husband of Ellen Byrd.<br>
<br>
Bates was hung in the morning and when I left town after dinner time his body was still hanging. Thus ended the life of one of the cowardly dastardly fiends of crime which infested this coast a few years ago.<br>
<br>
Such punished is rarely meted out to anyone in these days, and we all look at the prosperity of this grand country with pride. The strides we are making will be noted over the entire country and we may expect as good and peaceable a people as is to be found in any part of the world.<br>

VIGILANTES<br>
<br>
Janet Stwalley, "Vigilantes' rule in county short, in early days of county when law was slow, pioneers took matters into own hands and killed two desperadoes; but they paid dearly for their act," <B>Tacoma Sunday Ledger</B>. May 6, 1928 p. A-5.<br>
<br>
The doomed man glanced warily about him. On all sides were his stern visaged escorts, once his neighbors, then his enemies and now
his captors. He clutched his throat and winced at the thought of a noose tightening about it. No, if go to the scaffold he must, at least he would go fighting.<br>
<br>
The wagon in which the prisoner huddled, joggled from side to side. The driver back bumped was paying no heed to the horse's gait. He wore an expression of a man who feels a deed has been well done. At his belt swung a holster, but butt of a revolver protruding.<br>
<br>
A bitter sneer quirked the corners of the prisoner's mouth, as he contemplated the distance between his right hand and the revolver. Slowly and stealthily his fingers moved along the edge of the driver's seat.<br>
<br>
With a quick movement he jerked the six shooter from its holster and before his bodyguard was aware of the act, fired a succession of shots.<br>
<br>
The driver and several others groaned as bullets plowed their way though flesh. But the murderous grimace of revenge changed to the pain as a volley of shot from the guns of his captors caused the crazed prisoner to pitch forward.<br>
<br>
A roughly hewn slab of wood in the little old cemetery behind the Steilacoom asylum tells the rest of the story, but perhaps the reader is curious about this man, his name and the events leading up to his capture.<br>
<br>
There are few men alive today who remember those trying times in the "sixties" when owners of Donation Land Claims were constantly at the mercy of "land jumpers" and "cattle rustlers." And very few in number are they who recall the formation of the Vigilante committee, one made up of staunch pioneers who grew tired awaiting the moving of the slow machinery of the far off government.<br>

INDIAN STEVE LYNCHING.<br>
<br>
Lambert Florin, "Conconully Indian Scare," <B>Washington Ghost Towns.</B> Seattle: Superior, 1970,  p. 17-18.<br>
<br>
In January, 1891 Indian Steve was jerked from the Conconully jail by a howling mob of drunker miners. The tied his hands behind his back, blindfolded him and forced him down the road to a large tree.<br>
<br>
A heavy limb stuck out horizontally about fifteen feet up and a rope was thrown over it, the other made into a noose which was looped around Steve's neck. The lynchers hauled him into the air, jerking him up and down.<br>
<br>
The body swayed there a day or two and then the rope was cut off, the tied end remaining until the tree was cut down in 1938.<br>
<br>
This lynching and other incidents were part the "Conconully Indian Scare." The government restricting of the Indian population to the nearby Colville Reservation was difficult or impossible to enforce the natives making sporadic forays into Conconully and neighboring Ruby, Tonasket and Loomis.<br>
<br>
They were suspected at once when the dead body of C. S. Cole, driver for the freight line between Okanogan and Conconully, was found near the road near the close of 1890, wagon rolled over the cliff and horses gone.  There were no clues until a squaw who loitered around Conconully began spreading rumors that Indian Johnny and his friend Indian Steve had done the deed.<br>
<br>
Asked why she would inform on Johnny, her "fella," she said she had tried to get him to marry her but he would not.  She said one reason he had picked Cole, aside from stealing the horses, was that the freighter had poked fun at the Indian about his feeble attempts to raise a mustache.<br>
<br>
Deputy Ives took off after the pair of braves who he heard were at an encampment near Chilliwhist.  Johnny saw him first, drew a gun and fired, the bullet grazing Ives' cheek.  The deputy's shot was more deadly, hitting the Indian in the head and killing him.<br>
During the gun fire a squaw was wounded, which further angered the sullen tribesmen.<br>
<br>
Bad feeling was so strong Ives decided not to look for Indian Steve and get out as soon as possible.  He said later that as he rode away he could imagine guns aimed at his back, making his flesh crawl, but he escaped unmolested.<br>
<br>
Word was soon sent to the camp that Steve had better give himself up before there was more trouble, and on January 5, 1891, he surrendered to the sheriff in Conconully.  He was placed in jail and Judge Price, who knew Indian ways and thinking, started an
investigation before trial.  The next week the Ruby Miner was to print this ambiguous note:<br>
<br>
"Last Thursday morning twenty horsemen galloped through Ruby, the soft white snow muffling the sound of their horses' hooves and the slumber of the camp was not disturbed by their movements.  Death was in their hearts and they sped remorselessly onward." Jailer Thomas Dickson had been warned by the judge of the strong possibility of a lynching and when he saw the mob approaching, he hid the cell key under his mattress.  The mob soon found it, opened the door and dragged Indian Steve to his death.<br>
<br>
This item appeared in the Ruby Miner the following week:<br>
<br>
"Trouble is on foot and danger stalks abroad.  It is principally owing to the lynching of Steve that this condition exists-but there are many supplemental reasons.  George Monk accompanied by Smitkin started to convey the body to the Indian Mission.  The Indians claim that Monk, when he started out, was sitting on the corpse which was wrapped in a blanket and carried on a single bobsled.<br>
<br>
"The appearance of the body was the signal for the start of a big dance.  For two days the body was kept while the Indians stimulated themselves at the bier."<br>
<br>
The lynching did intensify matters.  It was now rumored Indians were gathering in the mountains for mass attacks on Conconully.  Another report bad it that every man, woman and child would be killed and scalped in vengeance for the deaths of Johnny and Steve.  Alarm grew to the point that citizens appealed to the U.S. Army for help.<br>
<br>
In response, on January 17, 1891, Gen.  A. P. Curry arrived with a detachment of soldiers and an arsenal for use of residents in case of attack.  One hundred eighty rifles and 3,000 rounds of ammunition were stacked in the courthouse.  When no raid developed, the guns were stored in an unused room where they gathered dust for many years.<br>

<br>
Ruby shared Indian troubles with Conconully.  Walter Brown had a dairy between the towns, delivering milk to both.  He attended a Fourth of July celebration in Ruby, arriving just in tune to
witness an atrocity.  An Indian brave name Pokamiakin, as handsome as he was bold and brash came into the crowd with a fast horse he had stolen, a well-known race horse, Nespelim.<br>
<br>
Sheriff Bill Tiffany ordered the Indian to dismount and submit to arrest but the brave refused and spurred the animal into a spurt.  Tiffany galloped alongside him, grabbed Pokainiakin by his long, black hair and dragged him along the ground.  Dairyman Brown, in telling the story,said the crowd was sure every bone in the Indian's body was broken but he got to his feet running.  In the hail of bullets, both he and the horse were killed.<br>
<br>
Winter snows were cruel to towns in the area, avalanches frequent and crippling the mining camps situated at the bottom of steep 
slopes.  One such slide <B>in </B>Ruby crashed down on an engineer named Magee and his two helpers who were pinned under a flume, which fortunately allowed them to breathe and saved their lives.  Not so lucky was a young Ruby man who taught school in Conconully.  He was buried in a slide on his way to the school, found dead in the big snow pile.<br>
<br>
Richard Price, later scheduled to preside over the never-held trial of lynched Indian Steve, was sent into the area by the Indian 
service to make a survey <B>of</B> all white men who had Indian wives.  He was to determine nationality, tribal connections of women. number of children, wealth and social standing of couples.  It was never revealed what purpose the survey was to serve, but it gained good results for Price.  He was justice of peace in Ruby and a well-versed counsellor on Indian affairs.<br>

<br>
In October,[1891] two well known freighters, Mr. S. S. Cole and Mr. Wilkinson disappeared.  Cole's horses and wagon were found at the springs that now bear his name.  No trace of the man could be discovered.  Murder was feared and a reward of three hundred dollars was offered for the recovery of his body and an additional one hundred dollars for the arrest of the murderer.  Since there were no clues and no police force to track down the criminals, it would have been a clear getaway had the guilty kept silent.<br>
<br>
The solution of the crime can be attributed partly to<br>
the guilty conscience of the boy Steve, and to the braggadocian
<br>
attitude of Indian Johnny when telling his sweetheart of his exploits. judging from available evidence, I would conclude that both Indians implicated themselves, but that Johnny's loose     talking  was of the most importance because it cleared up the  mystery  of the disappearance of both freighters.<br>
<br>
According to Johnny's story to his sweetheart, he and Steve suspected Mr. Wilkinson of having considerable money on his person.  While on his way to Ellensburg, they murdered him on the Colokum Creek road and tipped his wagon over the steep bank so that it was hidden from view from the road.  On their return trip across the Colville Reservation, the two gangsters overtook Mr. Cole.  Accounts vary as to exactly what occurred, and as to which Indian killed Mr. Cole and why.<br>
<br>
According to Johnny, they demanded tobacco and "chickamin" (money) from Mr. Cole.  When he refused, with the excuse that he did not have either, they shot him.  The Indian agent in his report of 1891 views the murder of Mr. Cole: "It was whiskey sold or given to the Indians by some white man that was the cause of the murder of the white man who was crossing the reservation last fall.<br>
<br>

Instead of spending part of his supposed loot on his sweetheart, Johnny jilted her and made love to another squaw.  The disappointed girl told Johnny's story of the two murders to another squaw and soon the whole matter was public gossip.<br>
<br>
A warrant was issued for Johnny's arrest and was given to Deputy Sheriff Lee Ives, a butcher in Conconully.  The deputy found Johnny with other Indians and a white man, Bill Eickmann, at the Chiliwist camp.  When Mr. Ives saw that Johnny was armo, he said to Bill Eickman: "Eickman, I deputize you to help me arrest this Indian." Eickman replied, "If you want to arrest that Indian, you do it yourself." The Indian fired at Ives, who then returned the shot, but it wounded a squaw instead.  The sheriff's second shot killed Johnny.<br>
<br>
The death of Johnny was followed by clamor for the arrest of Steven, which came to a climax when the decapitated body of Cole was found.<br>
<br>
Steve was persuaded not to resist arrest but to give himself up, as was explained by Mr. Richard M. Price, United States deputy marshal 
and justice of the peace at <B>Ruby.<br>
<br>

</B>"On January 4, 1891, at the east end of Omak Lake, I met Steven by appointment through Smitkin's niece Nancy.... I took him to the Mission and the Indians gathered around him and tried him from an Indian's standpoint of law." He admitted that he was a witness with Johnny to the Cole murder, but that the real murderer was a  Nez  Perce  Indian.  Mr.  Price  states:<br>
<br>
"As long as there was a warrant out for him for murder in the first degree, nothing could be done with him as a witness, so I brought
him in with the intention of getting him out on bail and making a witness of him, and in the meantime arrest the actual murderers of Cole.... U.S. officials had precedence in murder cases where they were committed upon an allotment or an Indian reservation.<br>
<br>
As soon as U.S. officials met the civil authorities they took precedence in all criminal matters.... My authority ceased when I turned him over to the sheriff of the county." Mr. Price collected both rewards, the one for finding Mr. Cole's body and the one for the arrest of Steve.<br>
<br>
Mr. Price states: "The Indian was given a hearing under a writ of habeas corpus and U.S. Commissioner George S. Hurley decided that he was entitled to bail, which was set at one thousand dollars."<br>
<br>
News of Steven's arrest spread immediately and before  his bail could be raised, a vigilante committee took Steven from the jail and instructed the jailer, Tom Dickson, not to spread the news until morning.<br>
<br>
Next day, Steven was found swinging from a large pine tree about a quarter of a mile south of Conconuily.<br>
<br>
It should be added that the vigilante committee was organized by prominent citizens in the community.  They excused themselves on the grounds that the same lawyers and court officials who cleared Pokamiakin were still in control and would probably duplicate their former action.<br>
<br>
Steven's corpse was put into a hastily constructed pine coffin, and this was placed on a bobsleigh.  George Monk was delegated to take the corpse to the house of Smitkin, an important subchief.  While gliding down a vall ey, seated on the coffin, Monk met Smitkin and two other Indians who were on their way to post bail for Steve.  Steve was a boy of fifteen and a son of Indian John, a prominent medicine man.<br>
<br>
Equally as serious as the lynching was the affront of Monk's sitting on the coffin, which was considered sacrilegious by the Indians.  When Monk arrived at Smitkin's, a number of Indians were present and his reception was far from cordial.  Smitkin feared for Monk's life and sheltered him in his own home until he could assist him in making his escape on his horse.  In hot pursuit came the Indians, but Monk managed to beat them to Cummings' ferry and store at the present site of the town of Okanogan.<br>
<br>
For two days the obsequies of Steve followed, with dancing day and night.  It is not known if the dancing was done with peaceful or warlike intentions because no white men were present.  It resulted, 
however, in the Indians' sending sixteen braves to Dakota <B>8</B> from where a "Messiah" craze had traveled westward.  The story had been featured in newspapers, particularly in the Spokesman-Review of Spokane.

INDIAN SCARE OF 1891<br>
<br>
Bruce A. Wilson, "The Indian Scare of 1891," <B>Late Frontier. A history of Okanogan County, Washington.</B> 1800-1941. Okanogan, Washington: Okanogan County Historical Society, 1990 p. 133-137.<br>
<br>
Life resumed [after the terrible winter of 1889-1890] for a well-known freighter, Samuel Smith Cole, but not for long.  In early-October of 1890, in the autumn following the Cow Killer Winter, the 46-year-old Cole was murdered while crossing the Col-
ville reservation with a load of goods.<br>
<br>
This led to the most unconscionable act in the history of Okanogan County, the lynching of a 15-year-old Indian boy at Conconully.  The lynching in turn prompted a period of near-hysteria customarily known as the Indian Scare of 1891.  Considering the times, it is not surprising that many whites became frightened.  But there was never any possibility of Indians launching a revengeful assault.  Throughout, they remained more in touch with this reality than did many whites.<br>
<br>
A career freighter farming a few miles up Salmon Creek, Cole was hauling merchandise from the Washington Central railroad at Coulee City to Pard Cummings' store at Alma.  Cummings-Francis Jackson Cummings, native of Maine-had driven stages in Montana and between Union Gap and Ellensburgh in Washington before opening a trading post on the Okanogan River, near the mouth of what was then known as the Salmon River, in 1886.<br>
<br>
Having crossed the Columbia River on Wild Bill Condon's ferry, Cole had advanced only about 9 miles across the South Half when, at a place known as Cold Springs (usually referred to today as Cole Springs), he was killed by a bullet through his forehead.  His body was removed and secluded.  Cole used mules for his freighting, probably four for long distance hauls.  Passers-by found one mule still attached to his heavilyladen wagon, blood splashed across the buckboard.<br>
<br>
About 20 horsemen scoured the country, looking for Cole's body and/or his murderers.  One of the riders was Charles Ostenberg, a prospector and millwright who had operated an arrastra at Squaw Creek and later built a flour mill at Okanogan.  Ostenberg said he had been over the ground a dozen times when, in December, remnants of Cole's body were found threefourths of a mile from the probable murder site.<br>

Only the lower portions of the body and a jawbone remained.  Evidently (Cole's family always believed) coyotes had done away with the rest.  An unbelieving widow and the five children living with her buried the remains near the family farm in the Clover cemetery near Spring Canyon road.  Virginia Grainger read the burial service as she often did since no Protestant minister lived in the Okanogan.<br>
<br>
The gruesome discovery inflamed the white community.  On the basis of rumors and alleged confessons, suspicion focused on two young Indians, Johnny, in his early 20's, and Stephen, about 15, who may have been a cousin.  Many whites assumed these two had murdered Cole.  Others deduced Johnny had been the ringleader and Stephen a bystander or unwilling participant.  A third theory held that both had been merely witnesses to a shooting committed by some one else.<br>
<br>
It was believed liquor had caused the barbarism or that the assailants were seeking money, tobacco, or more liquor.  There was even word that Johnny had been moved by revenge for an insulting remark directed at his efforts to grow a mustache.<br>
<br>
Warrants were issued.  Deputy sheriff Lee Ives, a Conconully butcher, located Johnny in a small village at the mouth of Chiliwhist Creek.  Ives observed that Johnny was armed.  According to one source, Ives said to Bill Eickman, another white who was present, "Eickman, I deputize you to help me arrest this Indian." Disinterested in accolades as a Good Citizen, or merely evidencing common sense, Eickman replied, "If you want to arrest that Indian, do it yourself."<br>
<br>
In a confusing melee, Johnny fired at Ives who then slightly wounded an Indian woman in her leg before dispatching Johnny with his second shot.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile Stephen had become tormented by his role, whatever it was, in the Cole murder.  Word seeped from the reservation that the lad would surrender if assured of a fair trial.  On Sunday, January 4, 1891, Richard M. Price, justice of the peace at Ruby and a U.S. deputy marshal, met Stephen at the east end of Omak Lake.  The two repaired to the St. Mary's mission chapel where an examination conducted by Indians concluded both Johnny and Stephen had<br>
witnessed a murder but had not committed it.<br>
<br>
Since  Price  could   not   ignore   the   warrant   issued   for<br>
Stephen's arrest, he departed with Stephen with intentions of turning him over to Sheriff M.A. Rush, securing his release on bail, and arranging for his testimony as a witness when the murderer was located and brought to trial.<br>
<br>
At Conconully Justice of the Peace W. H. Fifield conducted a preliminary hearing but denied bail.  M. C. Barney, a Conconully attorney, obtained a writ of habeus corpus.  That same afternoon Stephen appeared before U.S. Commissioner George J. Hurley who
ruled the prisoner was entitled to bail which was set at $1000.  Until this could be posted, Stephen was confined in the county jail.<br>
<br>
That night, in the words of the Ruby Miner, "twenty horsemen swept silently and swiftly through the town of Ruby... the soft white snow muffled the sound of their horses' hooves and the slumber of the camp was not disturbed. . . "<br>
<br>
The posse had been organized in the vicinity of Alma, where Pard Cummings' store was to have received Cole's goods and where the freighter and his family were well known.  It was composed of "prominent citizens." The winter these committed men rode through was totally unlike the previous year's cow killer.  Only four inches of snow had fallen.  Cattle grazed on the open range.<br>
<br>
Nobody was feeding his stock.  Probably, the horsemen followed what was then the most frequently traveled road between Ruby and Conconully, crossing Salmon Creek at the north end of Ruby and starting up today's route but swinging west to pass near Andrew Lake before entering town near the Conconully cemetery.<br>
<br>
Tom Dixon, the county jailer, was asleep in a livery stable near the jail.  James Malone, later a Riverside old-timer but then 15, was sharing Dixon's bed.  Posse members burst in.  They were masked.  Interviewed in 1936, Malone said their gun barrels, pointed at Dixon, looked like stove pipes.  Man and boy were tumbled out of bed.  Keys to the jail were found under the mat-
tress.  A terrified Stephen was dragged from his cell.  Dixon was locked inside.<br>
<br>
The horsemen rode half a mile to a stand of Ponderosa pines south of Conconully and hung the Indian youth from one of them.  He may have strangled because of an improperly fixed noose.  The "hanging tree" is long since gone.  It was situated between the present Conconully-Omak highway and what is now the Conconully reservoir, in the vicinity of Liar's Cove resort.<br>
<br>
Some old-timers place the site a half-mile east of the bridge crossing the North Fork of Salmon Creek.  Others say it was 500 feet east of that.<br>
<br>
Members of the posse were convinced Stephen had killed or helped kill Cole.  They felt too many Indians guilty of serious crimes were let off too lightly.  To them, setting bail meant Stephen would be freed untouched.  They were determined that Cole should not go unavenged.<br>
<br>
Their attitudes reflected those of many whites at the time.  "Just retribution had been given to one of the Cole murderers," reported the Kittitas Localizer.  "It was only an Indian," explained the
Ruby Miner.<br>
<br>
But Stephen by then seems to have been regarded by authorities more as a witness than a suspect (though the distinction at that time was not widely understood by the public).  He had been promised fair treatment.  Not a shred of evidence suggested he was Cole's slayer.  There seems little doubt that an innocent<br>
persona teen-aged boy-was hanged.<br>
<br>
Indians were outraged by Stephen's lynching and feared further retributions by whites.  Whites were frightened by the lndians'outrage.  They had reason to feel uneasy.  Only 15 years had passed since 5 of the 12 companies in Custer's Seventh cavalry were annihilated at Little Big Horn.<br>
<br>
Even in January of 1891, there was unrest in many parts of the West.  Sitting Bull had been assassinated and in South Dakota Indians massacred at Wounded Knee only the previous month.  General Miles was maneuvering against a reported 4,000 Indians "from the Dakotas" near Omaha, Neb., where "the wildest excitment" prevailed among whites.  A "probable" outbreak by 1,600 Bannocks was predicted at Fort Hall in southern Idaho.  Militia in several states had been called up.  In such a climate, concern among whites in Okanogan County-a few of whom had fought Indians before coming here-was understandable.<br>
<br>
But the time had passed for Indian wars in Washington State or anywhere else.  Seattle was now a city of 43,000.  Tacoma had 36,000 residents and Spokane Falls 20,000.  Telegraph lines linked troops and railroads moved them.  Even in Okanogan County, whites out-numbered Indians 1,500 to 1,200 (census figures, Page 106) and a far higher ratio of the Indians were women and children.  The notion of an uprising was ludicrous.  Nearly all Indians recognized this.  Many whites did not.<br>
<br>
Following the lynching, George Monk of Ruby was engaged to deliver Stephen's body, in a pine casket, to the reservation.  Monk used a horse-drawn bobsied.  There are vivid portrayals of his arrival seated on the casket, a sign of disrespect which further upset tribal members; of Chief Smitkin, the head man around Omak Lake, protecting Monk overnight; of Monk fleeing on horseback the next morning, pursued by Indians, "horses' tails flying out behind them like banners in the wind," noted the young James Malone; of Pard Cummings, observing the chase, crossing his Okanogan River ferry to rescue an agitated Monk, who never again, it may be surmised, would accept such an assignment.<br>
<br>
On the reservation, there followed several days of mourning and dancing, interrupted briefly by Father Enenne derouge, founder of St. Mary's, to secure Stephen's burial in the mission cemetery.
These excitements, together with what were interpreted to be Indian signal fires lighted on hilltops at night, caused consternation among many whites.  Some took refuge in Ruby, where there was talk of barricading women and children in the Fourth of July mine.  From Pogue Flat Will Kahlow drove Mrs. J. I. Pogue, her three daughters, and other apprehensive women and excited children to Conconully for a stay of several days with friends.<br>
<br>
In Alma armed men kept watch at Cummings'store and may have fired (ineffectively) on a small group, led by Gene Pollock, a former Texas Ranger, arriving from Ruby at night in the belief that hostilities might have begun.<br>
<br>
The Bottomleys up north "lived in terror," especially after hearing that Conconully was "full of troops," a sure indication of widespread fighting.  Settlers gathered in Pateros.  At John Thompson's ranch near the present site of Monse, men worked with firearms stacked, loaded, and "ready for instant use."<br>
<br>
Apprehension spread into the Methow.  There it was reported that 500 Indians were assembling to storm across the Chiliwhist Trail.  "Everyone was warned to prepare for the worst," recalled Laura Thompson, living on Wolf Creek in the upper valley.  Settlers made plans to build a stockade at the Lee Fulton place.  Men molded bullets and cleaned firearms.  Women filled burlap bags with clothing they would need at the stockade.<br>
<br>
"The next day was filled with fear and excitement, as each of us thought our hour might be near." But no war party materialized.  Instead, a few Indian women rode across the Chiliwhist to assure Methow Valley settlers they had nothing to fear.<br>
<br>
Not all whites became excited.  At Monse John Thompson's alarm created so many anxieties that "threats were made against him if he did not keep silent about the Indians and their affairs." While meetings were held to organize companies of militia at Thompson's, Loop Loop, Spring Coulee, and elsewhere, and blockhouses were planned.<br>
<br>
Personages such as L.C. Malott and W.L. Davis, certain the Indians would do no harm, refused to attend.  "I am acquainted with Chiefs Moses and Joseph," Rebecca Steveson wrote the Wilbur Register from her family's Columbia River ferry.  "There is no danger to be feared."<br>
<br>
Four days after the lynching, the Ruby town council, alarmed by emanations from the reservation, wired Acting Governor Charles E. Laughton to "send troops" and followed with a petition stating,<br>
<br>
     
Every indication is that there will soon be dirty work here ... Old Indian fighters say the signs are serious.  Send us aid and avert, if possible, this threatened catastrophe to these settlements.  The<br>
probable force of Indians we may have to contend with will be about 400 bucks.<br>
<br>
His home constituency so remarkably disturbed, Laughton needed no further prompting.  The governor ordered Company G of the state militia in Spokane Falls held in readiness "to be dispatched to the front." He instructed Adjutant General A. P. Curry in Spokane Falls to proceed to Conconully at once with arms and munitions for the settlers but to "preserve the peace at all hazards."<br>
<br>
It was January 17 when Curry and four associateshardly the "troops" Ruby had requested-arrived in Conconully.  By then, I I days had passed since the lynching.  Most settlers no longer were alarmed.  Curry brought with him 150, 180 or 200 rifles, depending on whose recollections are to be believed, and 3000 or 6000 rounds of ammunition.  The weapons were turned over to the county commissioners who paid $90 in freight charges and distributed many of the rifles among citizens.<br>
<br>
Two days later, Curry conferred with about 70 Indians assembled by the Colville Indian agent across the Okanogan River from Alma.  After promising his listeners the regular army could make "short work" of them if necessary, the general said if the Indians would discontinue their unsettling dances and stop carrying guns, except for hunting, "whites would treat them kindly and no soldiers would be brought in." Chiefs and head men told him there had never been the slightest possibility of warfare.<br>
<br>
Settlers resumed their normal pursuits.  Many were disgusted to find the weaponry provided by the state was unreliable.  "Not one round of ammunition would fire," said a Spring Coulee farmer who tried using one of the guns for hunting.  "Some of these rifles furnished us will snap three cartridges out of five before a discharge," complained a man in Ruby.  An uprising might have been more successful than anyone thought.<br>

<B>THE LYNCHING</B><br>
<br>
Edson Dow, "The Lynching," <B>Passes to the North. History of Wenatchee Mountains.</B> Wenatchee, Washington: Outdoor Publishing Company, 1963. p. 150-154.<br>
<br>
Shooting, knifing, stabbing and liquor seemed too frequently to go together.  Such incidents involved the coal miners of Roslyn and Cle Elum and the cowboys of Ellensburg and Yakima.  The saloon was too frequently the focal Point of these disturbances.  In 1880, a man lost his life as the result of one of these fights in the Churchill Saloon at Yakima.  The fight grew out of a swindle on a horse race, and ho was shot by Dave Correl.  Two other men were seriously wounded.  Both guns and knives were used.<br>
<br>
Samuel Vinson and his son, Charles, had been drinking heavily.  The elder Vinson entered tho Teutonia Saloon in Ellensburg at about seven o'clock Sunday evening, August 11, 1895, and demanded that John Buerglin buy him a drink.  Vinson was very drunk and had been causing a disturbance all day.  A fight started and Mike Kohlopp, bartender, stepped in.<br>
<br>
At that moment, young Charles Vinson entered the saloon with a drawn revolver.  John Buerglin went to Kohlopp's defense and was stabbed by Samuel Vinson on the right side below the ribs.  A shot rang out from the gun of young Charles, mortally wounding Mike Kohlopp.  But Mike was not yet finished and he hit Samuel Vinson over the head with a chair.  Mike Kohlopp died one hour later and John Buerglin died Tuesday evening at 3:30.<br>
<br>
The Vinsons, overpowered by patrons in the saloon and by police who arrived on the scene, were disarmed and immediately taken to jail.<br>
<br>
Feeling of hatred ran high against the Vinsons.  The men they had killed were highly thought of by many people in the community and were close friends of the Dutch who had settled in a small colony up<br>
Nancum Creek.  The court's dismissal of the bank robbers, who many thought were guilty of the robbery of the Roslyn Bank, didn't help the situation any.  Talk  began getting stronger, and the liquor flowed freely.<br>
<br>
Buerglin's death on Tuesday evening aroused the public, and talk of lynching was prevalent in all of the saloons.  Finally, Tuesday night at 12 p.m. 100 armed men marched to the courthouse and demanded entrance to the jail.  Sheriff Stinson refused to give up the keys.  He had confidence in the fact that the armed, maddened mob couldn't penetrate the strong walls of the jail which were thought impregnable, but against the pushing, raging mob any further action by him was impossible.<br>
<br>
Besides being fully armed, the mob had sledge hammers, tools, railroad irons and timbers.<br>

The door opening the sheriff's office and the two doors entering the jail were demolished.  The slow methodical work of the mob helped their temper not one bit and they finally reached the steel cage where the two Vinsons were confined.  At last the locks and bolts were battered in such a manner as to make <B>an</B> entrance into the cage.<br>
<br>
One of the men struck a match to get a light so that they could see and shoot the Vinsons, but one of the Vinsons fanned the light out with his hat.  Two shots were fired, but neither found its mark.  Finally a rope was thrown over each of their heads and they were led out into the street.  They were securely bound, and escape was impossible.<br>
<br>
After some debate as to where they should hung, the men were finally led to the corner of Seventh and Pine Streets to be hung on a tree near the sidewalk intersection.  After hanging for five hours, the bodies were taken down at seven o'clock Wednesday morning and laid on the sidewalk under the shade of the tree.<br>
<br>
Marshall Wishard, J. L. Brown and a Mr. Smith took the two bodies down.  Sometime after eight o'clock that morning the bodies were placed in a wagon and taken to the Cox Undertaking Parlors on Fifth<br>
Street, where they were washed, dressed and prepared for burial, which took place the following Thursday morning.<br>
<br>
Men were quickly arrested and taken before Justice Boyle on the following Tuesday and Wednesday.  Justice Boyle sat as Committing Magistrate.  Sever,,Ll of the arrested men were discharged and others were bound over to Superior Court for trial.  One of the men accused was the partner of the saloon keeper who was killed by Charles Vinson.  Another was an ex-deputy treasurer of Kittitas County.  Other men had been prominent in the work of the community.<br>
<br>
Some citizens took law into their own hands and made a citizen's arrest of one of the alleged lynching participants.  He was turned over to a man to be brought into town, and on the way they got into an altercation.  The captor made free use of stones, cutting the head and face of the prisoner badly.<br>
<br>
He was brought into town in a semi-conscious condition and turned over to Dr. Newland, who dressed his wounds.  His captor claimed that the prisoner attempted to take his revolver from him, but had failed. Rumors were rampant.  One was that this man had confessed, another that he admitted slapping one of the Vinsons after he was dead.  All this was denied.  There were as many wild stories afloat as there were men in the mob.  Complaints were being made for unlawful arrest, and warrants were issued for mob participation.<br>
<br>
By 9:30 Saturday morning, September 28, sitting room in the courthouse was at a premium.  It had been reported that the jury in the case of five men charged with lynching had reached a verdict.  At 9:45 the jury was brought in and a sealed verdict was passed to Judge Hume, who examined it.  The verdict was then handed to the
Clerk of the Court, who in a very solemn voice said, "Not guilty." The rumors were that the verdict was reached before midnight the night before.  One of the ballots taken was ten for acquittal, the next ballot was eleven for  acquittal  and  the  third  was  unanimous<br>
for acquittal.<br>
<br>
Other men were still held in the county jail, charged with the lynching.  According to the newspaper, the court held that the Prosecuting Attorney's office did not have the power to hold them for trial without a preliminary examination which had not been given.  The court instructed that the remaining prisoners be held until a complaint should be properly filed by the Prosecuting Attorney's office and a hearing held before a Justice by five o'clock the following Monday evening, otherwise they should be released.<br>
<br>
When this was not done, the information was dismissed since they were not properly arraigned before the magistrate.  The prosecutor, Mr. Wager, deemed it useless to give them a preliminary examination in view of the other cases tried before the court, and ordered their freedom.<br>
<br>
Four souls whirled into eternity! The horrible killing by the mad fighting mob, the lighted torches, the ringing fire bell and the bloodthirsty howling of men together with the Vinson boy's request to send his love to his mother . . . the spectacle of children view-
ing men at their worst did -much to restore law and order to the Wenatchee Mountain area.<br>

CLALLAM INDIANS<br>
<br>
Genevieve Miller, "Dungeness Massacre," <B>Tacoma News Tribune</B> March 5, 1972.<br>
<br>
Dinner guests at Dungeness' Three Crabs on the Strait of Juan de Fuca, can watch tall beach grass whipped to and fro by ocean winds. And ducks swooping down on marshes.<br>
<br>
Long-since forgotten ships once landed at the wharf, now only scattered pilings standing like dark phantoms.<br>
<br>
Few persons admiring the peaceful landscape could know that many years ago this was the scene of bitter feuds between Canadian  and Clallam Indians.<br>
<br>
History records three massacres at what was once called Whiskey Flats. The worst was September 20, 1868.<br>
<br>
Tales differ, but down the road from the popular seafood place in a neat fenced in cottage lives Aline Christensen, the woman who knows the true history. Her father in law, William Blake, as the lighthouse keeper who befriended the lone survivor of that slaughter.<br>
<br>
The Blakes young son, Richard,  never forgot that mutilated girl, later told his wife, Aline, the following story:<br>
<br>
On that fateful September night William Blake and his wife, Catherine grew concerned over some Indians they'd seen paddling back to Canada after a summer of hop picking near Tacoma. The moon shining through fog over the Strait, shed an eerie glow over the light house bedroom upstairs. "Will, " Catherine said, "I hope those Chimpseans made it across."<br>
<br>
William shook his head. "Before the fog thickened I peered through the spyglass. Couldn't see much but I fear they've camped on the spit."<br>
<br>
After he climbed the winding stairway to the tower top for his vigil of keeping the light burning and winding the heavy rope for the bell clanging its warning to passing ships, Catherine's worries increased. Even though her husband was young and brave, how could he stop Numah the Bad from carrying out his threat against the Chimpseans?<br>
<br>
The threat he made when one night eight nearly naked Chimpseans had stolen his pretty, sixteen year old wife, whom they rowed to
Protection Island, and thereafter to British Columbia. Numah had squinted his little black eyes, shaken his fist and hissed, " Some day I'll trap em."<br>
<br>
Sudden Catherine raised her head, where those screams she heard coming from the mouth of the spit? Just then the bell clanged and the normal sound convinced her she'd only heard seagulls wailing.<br>
<br>
She woke to pale sunlight filtering through drifting fog. Hearing her little girls giggling in their room she arose and started the kitchen fire. After a breakfast of hotcakes and syrup from blackberries picked last month on the mainland, she'd spell Richard off in the high bell tower.<br>
<br>
"Mary and Kathy," she called, " Get dress and tell Richard to fetch wood." As she mixed batter she pitied the Chimpsean women, constantly on the move, sometimes clear to Alaska, having only tents and canoes as homes.<br>
<br>
Just then her part-Spanish husband strode in, his dark almond shaped eyes blazing. "Now, Cath, keep calm...a Chimpsean girl's down in the store room, hurt read bad. She's only half alive, body all cut up. And the poor little thing's large with child, too."<br>
<br>
"No." Catherine stood there numb with shock until Richard grabbed his gun. "Bolt the door after me and take care of the girl. I'm going over....there." He motioned toward the Indian camp.<br>
<br>
Mary took carbolic salve, bleached flour sacks and smelling salts down the stairs, nearly fainting at the sight of the moaning, bleeding girl on the store room floor. After cleaning and dress the many wounds, even one nasty gash on her swollen abdomen, she stroked the girl's hair matted with blood, sand and seaweed. Turning pleading eyes on Catherine, the girl held out a gold coin she took from her mouth.<br>
<br>
"I'll keep it for you," Catherine promised. "You rest." She made the motions of cradling a baby and said, "You safe here."<br>
<br>
Richard returned from the scene of the carnage. "It's ghastly, seventeen dead. Eight men, the rest women and children. Bodies hacked to pieces...scattered everything. Heads on logs. Sand all blood soaked." He looked down at the limp figure. "I'm taking her to Fred Raineys his wife's Chimpsean. Bolt the door after we go."<br>
<br>
Hours later he returned from the mainland. "Raineys think she'll pull through." He shook his head. "Not much chance for the baby though. The girl told Rainey's wife they were all sleeping when the Clallams cut the ropes so the tent collapsed on them. It must have been hell, those butchers attached with clubs, knives and salmon spears.<br>
<br>
"The girl rolled over and played dead, then crawled clear over
here through sand and water. Imagine, with all those deep wounds."<br>
<br>
"Was it Numah?"<br>
<br>
"No one's sure. But Sam, the Dungeness Chief was in it, killed by a dying Chimpsean."<br>
<br>
The Blakes could not forget that horror. Vigilantes compelled the superstitious Clallams, who trembled in fear, to gather up the Chimpsean remains and bury them on the spit, giving it the name of Graveyard spit.<br>
<br>
C.S. King, the Indian agent rounded up twenty-six assassins, according to Judge Swan, a government teacher and historian. They were placed in irons at Skokomish. King officially declared the dead as seventeen, the loot as six hundred dollars, plus valuables.<br>
<br>
The Indian department to assuage the Chimpseans, located many of the stolen valuables and sent them, along with much money and supplies to the British Columbia Tribe.<br>
<br>
When the girl was out of danger General McKinney took her to Fort Simpson though the <B>Victoria Colonist</B> did not confirm her arrival. For years the Blakes worried about her.<br>
<br>
After relating this tragic story, Aline Christensen added that many years afterwards an Indian secretly appeared at Dungeness. He stalked around Graveyard Spit. He rowed to the light house, then returned to Whiskey Flats.<br>
<br>
Approaching an old white man sitting outside the tavern, the Indian asked, "You, old man...you 'member long time ago?" The old timer nodded and the Indian continued "You 'member when Clallams killed many Chimpseans?" Again the white man nodded and the Indian asked, "Member girl who crawled to the light house? Girl big to bust with baby?"<br>
<br>
"Yep, the old timer replied.<br>
<br>
The Indian grunted, squared his shoulders and announced, " I am that baby."<br>

INDIAN MASSACRE BROUGHT RETRIBUTION<br>

The last major bloodletting among the Indians of this area was September 21, 1867, when twenty-six Clallam Indians massacred seventeen Chimsean (Canadian) Indians on Dungeness Spit.<br>
<br>
The group of eighteen Indians were asleep in a camp on the spit when the Clallams massacred seventeen men, women and children. Only one to escape was a woman, who was left for dead.<br>
<br>
Captain James G. Swan, pioneer settler and writer describes the incident thus:<br>
<br>
"On September 21, 1867, a party of twenty-six Clallam Indians attacked a number of Chimsean Indians who were quietly asleep in the camp near Dungeness light house and killed seventeen men, women and children. The only one of the party of eighteen to escape was a woman badly wounded and left for dead but she recovered.<br>
<br>
"As soon as I heard of the affair, I notified General T.J. McKenny, Superintendent of Indian Affairs, at Olympia. He dispatched Agent Charles King to confer with me at Port Townsend about the arrest of the murderers whose names I had learned through the assistance of the Duke of York, head chief of the Clallam tribe.<br>
<br>
"Agent King and I arrested ten of the murderers at Port Discovery. I went alone to  Dungeness and arrested eleven more and took them to Skokomish. Returning to Dungeness I arrested five more, making twenty-six in all."<br>
<br>
He relates that the wounded Indian woman was cared for by the wife of Benjamin Ranie of Dungeness, a Chimsean. When she was able to travel, Captain Swan sent her to Victoria and from there she was sent back to her home at Fort Simpson aboard the steamer <B>Otter</B>.<br>
<br>
With the woman went all the things recovered from the hospital site and a lot of presents sent to the Chimseans.<br>
<br>
Swan says the twenty-six Indians were placed in irons at Skokomish and put at hard labor. He does not dwell on details of other punishment. The presents sent were what he calls "Mamoke Klose Tumtums" between the Chimseans and Clallams.<br>
<br>
"The Indians were all satisfied."<br>

DUNGENESS MASSACRE.<br>
<br>
Edward S. Curtis, "The Dungeness Massacre," <B>The North American Indian.</B> IX, p. 22-24.<br>
<br>
About 1869 occurred a typically cold-blooded massacre of a party of Tsimshian, one of the last acts of intertribal warfare.  One evening a band of more than thirty of these northerners, southward bound, disembarked from a single large canoe to camp for the night on Dungeness spit.  <B>It </B>happened that some ten or fifteen years previously two Clallam women had been abducted by the Tsimshian, and when the people of the Clallam village Tsiskat saw the voyagers<br>
land, they immediately despatched couriers to Ts6q, Sttitl6m, and Shchqaiing, in each of which villages lived relatives of the two<br>
women.<br>
<br>
The result was that before midnight some twenty-five men had assembled at Tsiskat to lay their plans.  Most of them were young men who, because of governmental restraint, had had no opportunity to engage in raids, and they were eager for the fray.  A dense fog had rolled in, which, with the darkness, minimized the possibility of detection.  In some trepidation they embarked, to paddle out along the west side of the long narrow spit and reach a point behind the Tsimshian camp, which was on the inner, or eastern, side of the hook.<br>
<br>
Actually launched on their murderous expedition, some of them began to entertain doubts of the advisability of proceeding.  What would the white people say? King, the agent, lived not far away at Port Angeles.  What would he do? Perhaps they ought to talk it over a little more.  Some one suggested that they had not yet blackened their faces, and the pretext for delay was seized with carefully concealed relief.<br>
<br>
They landed, built a small fire, and with charred sticks blackened their faces as they considered what they <B>ought to do.  So many years</B> had elapsed since the abduction of the Clallam women that one man questioned their right to take vengeance.  In the end, however, the fear of being thought lacking in courage caused each to adhere to the original intent, and they reimbarked.<br>
<br>
A landing was made behind the camp, and two scouts crossed the narrow, sandy neck to reconnoitre, leaving the others to follow.  The northerners were found asleep within a rude shelter of slabs, canvas, and mats.  The flickering light of a dying fire showed that there were far more women than men, an encouraging circumstance.  The two men withdrew a short distance to await their comrades.<br>
<br>
A woman got up to replenish the fire, and in search for fuel she
almost stumbled over the crouching scouts.  Still there was no sign of the main body, and at last one of the two, half in anger and half in sheer recklessness, fired into the camp.  Instantly the Tsimshian leaped to their feet and grasped their weapons, but at the same time the Clallam rushed up to their scouts and began to shoot.  Crouching in the firelight, the Tsimshian offered an easy mark, and none was spared, for slavery was now illegal.<br>
<br>
When the firing ceased, the Clallam rushed forward, each eager to obtain a trophy.  Only the men were decapitated, and as there were but ten men in the Tsimshian party the scramble for heads developed some altercation.  Fingers and ears were ruthlessly cut off in plundering the dead of trinkets, and when at last the work of mutilation and pillage was over, the bodies of ten men, twice as many women, and five children lay on the beach.<br>
<br>
Suddenly a cry went up.  A Clallam was found dead.  Immediately accusations began to rain upon the scout who had fired the first shot and thus given the Tsimshian a chance to grasp their guns before the Clallam came up.  Words led to blows, and bloodshed was narrowly averted.  Then, the flush of savage triumph dispelled by the quarrel, they threw away their gory trophies and returned in silence to their homes, bearing the body of their companion.<br>
<br>
This matter came to the attention of the agent, who had all the participants placed in custody on Skokomish reservation, and there set them at hard labor digging stumps, under guard with ball and chain.  The raiders placed the burden of blame on the scout who had fired the first shot, and he afterward comforted his embittered soul by assassinating three friendly Tsimshian, each on a separate occasion.<br>

<B>The Perkins Murder</B><br>
<br>
Thelma Kimmel, "The Perkins Murder," <B>The Fort Simcoe Story.</B> Toppenish: Toppenish Review, 1954, p. 16-20.<br>
<br>
Suddenly ending the years of peace and security on the Yakima Reservation came the echo of war drums from across the Columbia.  The Yakimas did not openly participate in the Nez Perce War, if at all, and Chief Moses and Smohalla apparently gave no aid to their desperate kinsmen yet many a heart beat in sympathy with the avenging warriors.  There came a day when a number of active Yakima lads were discovered missing from the agency and when Wilbur learned by "Moccasin Telegraph" that they had gone to join Chief Joseph's band, he set out at once, alone and unarmed, to overtake the runaways.<br>
<br>
The agent came upon the boys in camp not far from the Columbia River and though they were well-armed and Wilbur bared his breast fearlessly as he rode up to them saying: "Shoot if you will boys", no hand lifted a gun.  Eager as they were for adventure and full of sympathy for their unfortunate cousins, the lads had no wish to harm the man they loved and when Wilbur ordered them back to the Reservation, they returned without protest.  But this mild escapade was only the beginning of the agent's trials.<br>
<br>
In July of 1878 a band of Renegade Indians, crossing the Columbia near Umatilla, were fired upon by soldiers in a patrolling steamer.  Some of the horsemen were killed but several escaped and succeeded in crossing the river.  With anger and a lust for revenge speeding their travel the Indians crossed the Horse Heaven hills and forded the Yakima River.  Instead of swinging east to join Chief Moses whose friendship was no surety, they sped northwest across the Rattlesnake hills in the general direction of Yakima City.<br>
<br>
A cattleman, Lorenzo Perkins, and his young wife, Blanche, had been living in an old Hudsons Bay cabin at White Bluffs.  Uneasy at the sight of so many tents and canoes on the opposite side of the Columbia, they decided to hurry home to Yakima City leaving their herds to fare as they would.<br>
<br>
At dawn on that fatal day, Blanche gathered a lunch into a knapsack, and quickly placing a few needed possessions upon a pack horse, the two headed their sturdy mounts westward.  Though neither of them were over-anxious with fear, accustomed as they were to the wilderness, they must have looked back occasionally to see if they were followed for there were no hiding places on the vast hot desert.
When they reached the haven of Rattlesnake Springs, a popular resting place midway to settlement where clear water and green shade broke the drought of the sagebrush desert, they decided to unsaddle their weary mounts and partake of a quick lunch.  All was peaceful on the familiar scene and they forgot their fears.<br>
<br>
Suddenly on the slope to the south seven riders appeared and came at once to the camping spot.  Lorenzo and Blanche, not knowing that they were renegades but never having seen these Indians before, decided to offer their uninvited guests the lunch they had spread out, and to continue on their way.  Lorenzo began to saddle the horses but Blanche abruptly stifled a warning scream as she noted an Indian had raised a gun at him.<br>
<br>
"Get on and ride for your life," her husband ordered as he helped her on her horse.  Not waiting to finish saddling, he followed suit but they had gone only a short distance when well-aimed shots brought Lorenzo to the ground, dead.  In desperation Blanche raced on, knowing there was no good now in halting, but as she pressed her mount to leap a ravine, rocks loosened and the horse stumbled, hurling his rider to the ground.<br>
<br>
The murderers bore down upon their victim stoning her mercilessly.  They did not see fit to waste a bullet to end her piteous misery as she pleaded for her life, but dragging Lorenzo's body to the young woman's side, they threw rocks over both of them.  Not yet expired, Blanche pushed one feeble hand upward against the crushing weight before death ended her torture.<br>
<br>
Seizing what they wanted from the packs, the killers moved on swiftly to the Wenas valley where they fired recklessly at cowboys riding herd on cattle -not stopping in their flight.  The frightened herders rushed into Yakima City, shouting out warnings to settlers on their way and soon all the valley was thrown into panic, sure that a mass attack was forthcoming.<br>
<br>
Homesteaders hurried to town with their families, leaving stock and possessions.  Guns were oiled and loaded in readiness-old blunderbusses that hadn't seen action since the Civil War.  Fortifications were flung up quickly and women and children were packed into the main hotel at Yakima City, but no attack came to justify the frantic preparations.<br>
<br>
Nine days after the murder, the bodies of Lorenzo and Blanche were brought in by a scouting party and buried in the little pioneer cemetery.  Family and friends were stricken with grief and terror and a burning desire for revenge surcharged the settlement.<br>


At once a delegation was sent to Fort Simcoe to <B>lay</B> the matter before Father Wilbur and to demand that he appeal to the Governor for arms and ammunition for the settlers to use in protecting their homes.  The citizens seemed to resent the agent's comity toward his charges and to regard his trusted Indian police with misgivings.<br>
<br>
The peaceful years of comradeship with the Yakimas were forgotten; fear and mistrust were rampant.  Some whites fled to The Dalles, among them a few of Wilbur's helpers, but most of them remained to guard their only worldly possessions.  Needle guns were sent up from Vancouver to settlers on the river from Yakima City to Kittitas that they might outfit their own volunteer army.  Some of these guns are treasured heirlooms of those pioneer's descendants today.<br>
<br>
Not a sign of hostility came from the camps of Moses or Smohalla, yet Wilbur knew too well that the hatred and suspicion of the settlers was directed toward them and that it would take only a rash spark to ignite a war that was sure to end in massacre.  How his reservation Indians would deal with such a situation, he could not be sure.<br>
<br>
The missionary was face to face with the most perilous time in his spectacular career; it was a testing hour for his friendship with Chief Moses.  He did not believe that the proud chief would give shelter to the renegades nor that Smohalla's small band would dare to give the murderer's asylum.  There was no friendship between the powerful Chief Moses and the lesser Smohalla who held his impoverished following with his strange "Dreamer Cult" religion.<br>
<br>
After a long, weary campaign, with pillage and bloodshed on every hand, General Howard and Colonel Bernard defeated the Bannocks and Piutes in final battles in the Umatilla region where they encircled the enemy before they crossed the Columbia.  This fact gave the settlers around Yakima a little ease and they dared to gather up their herds and harvest crops, but they never once relaxed guard, carrying guns to the fields and watching their cabins anxiously for the renegades were still at large.<br>
<br>

<B><br>

Father Wilbur and Chief Moses</B><br>
<br>
Father Wilbur and his Indian police kept a constant patrol on the reservation and organized troops of settlers, made scouting trips across the hills but the murders of the Perkins couple escaped detection.  Wilbur, fearing action by incited white men far more than he feared Indian attack, decided to appeal to General Howard for assistance in apprehending the renegades.<br>
<br>
     
General Howard's visits to the reservation are remembered in a much lighter vein than warfare by Judge Kuykendall who, as a small boy, slipped into the great council tent where Father Wilbur in his long black coat sat on a platform beside General Howard resplendent in gold-braided uniform while Chief Moses in coruscating splendor of beadwork made picturesque contrast.<br>
<br>
Whatever had been told of his campaign strategy, the bearded, one-armed hero of Shiloh had only admiration from the agency doctor's son as he held him on his knee and gave him candy.  General Howard seemed to have an inexhaustible supply of sweets ever handy for children-Indian or white.<br>
<br>
However the peaceful stillness of the valley gave the military leader no feeling of alarm and he seemed little inclined to settle the vexing situation or to endeavor to bring matters to a<br>
head.  He had finished too drastic a campaign to be perturbed over the murder of two lone settlers.  This attitude did not appease the citizens and Wilbur realized that it was up to himself to take de-
cisive action in tracking down the murderers whose freedom threatened the valley's safety.<br>
<br>
He sent again for Chief Moses who came at once with six of his sub-chiefs and who gave no evidence of hostility or contumacy.  Wilbur was more than ever convinced of the chief's sincerity.  He gave his visitors all the honors of welcomed guests with gifts of choice foods and camping facilities and he did not mention the subject of the renegades until a week of social amity had passed.  Cautiously then the agent approached the subject not wishing his friends to feel that even a grain of suspicion lay in his mind.<br>
<br>
"Do you know anything of the Indians who participated in the hideous atrocity at Rattlesnake Springs?" he asked Moses at last.<br>
<br>
"I know what my people tell me," the chief answered with straight-forward glance.  "They give me seven names of bad men from Umatilla tribe."<br>
<br>
"Tell me what is in your heart now, my friend, toward the whites", Wilbur continued, "That I may send your word to Washington."<br>
<br>
"Do you not know what is in my heart by now?" Moses returned patiently.  "I have kept my tribe from war.  When Chief Joseph fight, my men do not go on warpath.  When the Snakes and Bannocks fight, Moses not fight.  When strange Indians come to my camp; I drive away.  I keep peace always between the Indians and the whites.  I am your friend.  General Howard promised me a reser-

vation in <B>my </B>own Coulee.  If I not get it, I talk to you about
coming here." Wilbur believed more than ever in the chief's integrity but felt that the general's rash promise of a reserve in the desolate wasteland only made added trouble.<br>
<br>
He asked Moses for his help in locating the murderers and the chief agreed to assist what he could.  Together they want to Yakima City to make plans with the citizens for the search.  Only the presence of the beloved missionary kept the angry townsmen from seizing the chief; memory of those mutilated bodies was too close and they wanted to believe Moses hostile.<br>
<br>
Fifteen agency Indians and thirty white men formed a company to search the hills where Moses believed the renegades might be hiding and the chief agreed to send some of his best scouts to aid in the 
search.  It was decided that Chief Moses should have <B>a</B> day's start to the Columbia that he might make arrangements for all to cross the river.<br>
<br>
Many of the white men disapproved of cooperation with Moses and beyond the knowledge of Wilbur made plans to be on the road ahead of the chief to waylay him and take him prisoner.  Moses learned of the plan and returned to his home full of suspicion and uncertainty.  Three days later, resenting the attitude of the settlers but wanting to keep faith with his missionary friend, he started out with nine men to aid in the search.  He was surrounded in night camp by a party of the volunteers who took him and his men prisoners, allow. ing five to go under guard to direct the searchers.<br>
<br>
Father Wilbur informed of the arrest by his scouts, hurried to Yakima City and after much entreaty was permitted to take Moses and his sub chiefs under his own custody, returning with them to Fort Simcoe.  Wilbur sent messages at once to headquarters urging that Moses be allowed to visit Washington, D. C., and to present his problems to the President before the citizens took rash action against him.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile the renegades were finally tracked down; one turned state's evidence; one committed suicide, and those captured and not killed in an attempted jail break, were duly hanged on a stout 
scaffold built <B>by </B>eager citizens in Yakima City.  But even this was not enough to satiate the white men's desire for retaliation and the agent had yet to continue his guardianship of his Indian friend.<br>

<br>
THE WILLIAM WHITE MURDER.<br>
<br>
Urban East Hicks, "William White Murder, " <B>Incidents, dangers and hardships endured during the Yakima and Clickitat Indian War, 1855-
56.</B> Part three of the personal recollections of Captain Urban East Hicks.<br>
<br>
Among the residents in my neighborhood was a much respected farmer named William White whose family, with others were forted up in what was known as Eaton Fort on Chambers Prairie.  No hostile Indians having been seen or heard of in that neighborhood for a long time, the family went, on Sunday, to a religious meeting, held in a country, school house a few miles distant.<br>
<br>
Mrs. White and another lady named Stewart, with a child in her arms rode in a small one-horse cart, while Mr. White walked and drove.  On their return, and when almost within sight of the fort, a party of six Indians, headed by Yelm Jim a well known Indian in that neighborhood rushed out on horseback from a point of timber near the road and attacked White.<br>
<br>
An effort was made to get hold of the reins of White's horse, and in the scuffle they were dropped.  A shot was fired at White, wounding him severely, but he still continued to fight his assailants manfully until overpowered and killed.<br>
<br>
In the meantime the horse, taking fright at the shots and noise started on a keen run down the road toward the fort.  An attempt was made to overtake him, but he was too fleet for the savage's ponies.  The women clung to the cart, and the big gate being open, the horse ran straight into the fort, thus saving the lives of the two women and child; but the mother holding the child in her arms had one foot terribly mangled by the wheel of the cart, and but one board remained of the cart-bed when they reached the fort.<br>
<br>
The body of Mr. White was found the next day by a relief party  near the scene of attack, stripped and horribly cut to pieces.  Yelm Jim was afterward caught and <B>hunq</B> for this deed.  Mrs. White is now the wife of the Hon.  S.D. Ruddell of Olympia.<br>
<br>
About this time, or perhaps prior, a man by the name of Northcraft engaged in hauling supplies from Olympia to the Yelm Prairie was waylaid on the road about half-way between Chambers Prairie and the Yelm, the savages taking him from the wagon after he was wounded, and tying him to a tree, amused themselves by shooting arrows into him and otherwise tormenting him until he expired.<br>
<br>
The wagon and contents what they could not carry away with them was destroyed.<br>

(Mrs. Ruddell was Mrs. William White at the time of the murder.).<br>
<br>
Mr. White was not satisfied with [his first] claim and came to the Sound and took a claim twelve miles east of Olympia, where we lived and did well until the Indian troubles of 1855-56 when we had to go to forts to live.<br>
<br>
We remained in the fort until spring, and some of the families thinking the trouble was over wanted to return, two or three families going into one house for mutual protection from the Indians.<br>
<br>
William Stewart and family and Mr. White and family, were at the Eatons.  There was preaching appointed at the schoolhouse for Sunday, so we put a horse to a cart and went; but the report which had previously been circulated that Mr. Northcraft was missing frightened the people and minister and the meeting was given up.<br>
<br>
We then went to the home of Mr. Conner, who was sick at the time and who died in three weeks after this event, and after a short visit there started home.<br>
<br>
On the way home the Indians came upon us when we were coming around a point of timber.  One of them came so close to Mr.  White before he showed his gun, that when he raised it and fired Mr. White caught the gun from the Indian's hand and fought with it.  Our horse became frightened and ran away, taking us to Mr. Eaton's.  Mr. White was walking by the side of the cart when he was attacked, and Mrs. Stewart and her baby and myself and baby were in the cart.<br>
<br>
The horse being large jumped to one side to keep the Indian from catching him, which nearly turned the cart over, and my sister-in-
law was thrown on the wheel and her foot caught and the shoe torn from it, and the sole was torn completely of f the shoe.  Her foot was seriously hurt, and she did not wear a shoe for two months.<br>
When we reached home there were two men and the house, Mr. Eaton and Mr. Berry who had just returned from hunting for Mr. Northcraft.<br>
<br>
I begged them to go to Mr. White, but they had heard the firing, and instead of doing as I wanted they went to cleaning, and fixing their guns, and would not, nor did not go to him, but prepared to go to the fort.  I begged to be allowed to stay in doors, and Mrs. Stewart was so sick she could not sit up, but the men thought it was not safe to stay, so they fixed the cart so Mrs. Stewart could lie down and put the children in some way and I on horseback.<br>
<br>
Mr. Eaton had a gun and revolver, and he gave the latter to me and showed me how to use it, and said if the Indians attacked us he
would fight until he failed, and then I must do my best with the revolver, and to not give up alive.  Mr. Berry walked and led the horse, carrying also his gun and revolver, and thus we went to the fort that night.<br>
<br>
At the fort we found P. Northcraft with the corpse of his brother but they were so frightened that they would not venture to go to Mr. White.  The next day they brought him in, and we buried him.<br>
Although the trial was great, yet we felt comforted that we succeeded in getting his body to give it a decent burial.  Mr. Biglow took Mrs. Stewart, myself and the children home with him and kept us there until her husband and my son came home from the volunteer service, when we returned to the fort and remained there until peace was declared in the fall of 1856.<br>

THE INDIAN WAR.<br>
<br>
Mrs. George Blankenship, "Mrs Jane W. Pattison," <B>Early History of Thurston County, Washington.</B> Olympia, Washington: n.p., 1914, p. 128-131.<br>
<br>
"About this time we decided to take advantage df the Government's liberal offer in regard to donation claims. In those days to every man was given the chance to take up 640 acres of land and, as an encouragement to the women who had to endure the trials and privations of the wilderness, for a very few years the government made the offer to her of an equal amount of land as that her husband was given, as a gort of a recompense for her hardships.<br>
<br>
Uncle Sam gave us women this land just as he would a new dress or something else we wanted real badly for it was a recognized fact the women were worth as much as the men in settling up and developing the new country.  Well, with an ox team we came to Tum-
water, or Newmarket, as it was called then.  Crosby's mill and store was about all that there was there.<br>
<br>
We swam the oxen across the Des Chutes River and went out on what was even then called Chambers Prairie, travelling through big woods all the way.  David Chambers was living on the Chambers homestead and we took up our donation claims next to his.  Pattison Lake was on our place and was named from my husband.<br>
<br>
Here we built what was to be our home for many long, hard years a
log cabin, added to from time to time as the babies began to come.  Three of my children were born there.  It was a hard, lonesome life I led there.  It seemed that if ever there was a hard, unpleasant thing to be done I was the one to be called on.<br>
<br>
For a few years I had no babies to keep me tied down, so whenever the neighboring women for ten miles around were sick, or there was a new baby came, or a death, any trouble, I was always the first one sent for, and I was nothing but a kid in years myself."<br>
<br>
Here Mrs. Pattison ceased talking for a moments and began silently musing into the past.  Her eyes grew dreamy and it was plain that once again the heroic woman was ministering the wants of the friends who long since have finished their work.  A query about the Indian war broght her wide awake again and started her flow of reminiscences.<br>
<br>

"Yes, indeed, I was <B>in </B>the Indian war, and knew the instant Mr. William White was killed, for I heard the shot and saw part of the struggle. Mr. White, with his wife and her sister, Mrs. Stewart, had been to church that day, the two  women, each with a little child in her arms, were riding in a cart, with Mr. White walking behind with the lines in his hands driving the horse, when the Indians emerged on foot from a little point of timber a little ahead Of them.<br>
<br>
They began to struggle with Mr. White and the horse became frightened and ran away with the women.  This brought them away safe, and the last Mrs. White saw of her husband in life he was grapplng with a big indian buck.  We knew very well that Mr. White was killed, but none dared. to go after his body that evening, so all night we waited, in fear and trembling, not knowing what moment the Indian's would attack our cabin, but we were not molested, and in the morning my men folks started after Mr. White.<br>
<br>
I told them to take one of my sheets along, which they did.  They found the body where they thought they would.  There had evidently been a great struggle before Mr.  White gave up his life, for the ground was all torn up, and trampled.  Mr. White's dog had stayed by his master all night.<br>
<br>
The Indians had stripped the body of every stitch of clothing except the boots.  Our men placed the body on a board they had taken for that purpose spread the sheet over him and brought the remains to the spring in front of our house.  They called me and I bound up the dead man's head the best way I could to hide the cruel  wounds and bruises the Iiadians had made.<br>
<br>
One arm was broken and he was shot through a vital part.  Then I spread another clean sheet over the form and the men carried him on the board to a vacant house belonging to Mr. Chambers.  I
followed on foot and that wasn't an easy thing to do.  Men we got to the house we were joined by Mrs. White and the neighbors.<br>
<br>
Among the most pathetic events of this awful day was the arrival of Mrs. Bigelow, Mr. White's daughter.  Mrs.  Bigelow had only been married a little over a year and was quite a young girl.  She came galloping up with her four-months-old baby in her arms, the rain simply pouring down on the mother and child.<br>
<br>
My husband took the baby and. helped the distracted girl from her horse.  She ran into where her father's body was laid and I tell you 
that was hard, too.  I warmed the baby and tended it <B>all,day.  </B>That baby is now Mrs. Tirzah Royal.<br>
<br>
"We buried Mr. White out in the little cemetery on Chambers Prairie and then had to return to our homes.  When I started back, one after another of the neighboring women begged to go with me and stay at our house till the scare quieted down.  So in all we were fourteen who were sheltered by our two-room cabin.  Here we stayed for three weeks while the men were building the block house.<br>
<br>
This block house on Chambers Prairie was standing until a few years ago.  As I had a big Dutch oven I baked all the bread that was consumed by these fourteen people, and I can tell you I baked every, and all day, too.<br>
<br>
"When the block house was finished we all moved in.  The families 
who were there at that time and who had rooms <B>in</B> the block house were Thomas Chambers, the McMillans, Mrs. White with her children, the O'Neals, the Parsons and Mrs.  Stewart.  Mrs. Stewart gave birth to a baby the day after we moved in.  Almost all our men had joined the volunteers to fight the Indians and we women, with the children, had to stay there all the time with one or two men left to guard us.<br>
<br>
We brought our water from the creek, the banks of which had been cleared of brush so the Indians couldn't ambush there.  It, was very unhandy to do our work, for each family had only one room in the block house to live in, and everything-cooking, washing, sleeping-had to be done in this one room.<br>
<br>
I got so tired of that way of living that we were the first family to return to our home, but we were not molested and soon took up our regular way of living.<br>
<br>
Well, the years passed and we had three children who were ready to be sent to school, so we sold my part of the donation claim to David Chambers and moved into town, where the children could have advantages and see something.  We came to Olympia the week Lincoln was assassinated.  I was glad to come, for we were all good and tired of living away out there.  We bought a place of John Swan, on
the Eastside. which has been the Pattison home ever since, although, the orchard that my husband planted has long ago been divided up into city lots and is almost all built over now.  When we moved to our new home, Mrs. Bigelow, Mrs. Horton and a little later, Dr. Lansdale, were my only. neighbors.  We have had seven children', only two, my son James Renwick and Mrs. Brad Davis, are still living.<br>
<br>

My husband, father-in-law, all the Pattison brothers, my babies, <B>all 
</B>are gone, but I am still here.<br>

THE WHITE RIVER MASSACRE.<br>
<br>
Nancy Russel Thomas, "The White River Massacre," <B>The Weekly Ledger.</B> November 18, 1892.<br>
<br>
In May, 1854, we built a small house and moved on our place.  The notorious Whitson, who figured so in the massacre of our neighbors a year or two afterwards, moved us up the river in a canoe.I was always afraid of him.  In October there were several families on the river, viz: Cox's,Kirtland's, C.C. Thompson from Louisiana, Lake boys and King's from Iowa, D.A. Neely's from Missouri, Kersand and Cooper from Wisconsin, Will Brannan's from Illinois.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Neely's was the first child born on the river, and mine, Mrs. Aaron Conger of Ellensburgh the second.  Mrs. Will Brannan's was the third.  Everything was peaceable till June, 1855.  When I was alone one day two Indians came to kill me.  We had the house full of provisions.  The dog scared them away.<br>
<br>
The fall of 1854 was the great fish time.  The Indians came from all over the Sound for salmon.  The fish weir was built at our place, and they carried off tons of dried salmon.  We didn't fear them till the next summer, but they were preparing then for the outbreak.  My mother was always afraid of them.<br>
<br>
January llth, the river overflowed the whole valley; the men who had been away came home and stayed two weeks.  On the 22nd we had another overflow.  Our folks and Mr. Neely when to work again.  We all had to work for our bread, and butter, we couldn't get.<br>
<br>
After this we had a very nice winter.  In March we put in a garden, which the Indians had the benefit of.  On July llth an election was held in our house.  Allen Porter was there and said the redskins were getting saucy; he believed there was going to be trouble.  The men laughed at him, but it set me to thinking and watching and there was not a strange Indian came into camp but what I knew it.<br>
I was teaching at the time; had taught just six weeks.  There were eight miners at our place fixing to go to the mines.  Amasa Miller was the only one that came back.  The others were killed by Indians.  There was no one afraid but Porter and I.<br>
<br>
Some time in September he came in the morning.  The Indians had run him all night long.  His clothes were torn from him, his flesh scratched as if torn with iron hooks.  I wish some of these "know-alls" could have seen him, as "seeing is believing."<br>
He was so exhausted when he came to the river he did not have the strength to get in the canoe without help.  All the families left their homes for Seattle, where we stayed two weeks.  Acting Governor Mason and Judge Edward Lander said there was no danger and advised us to go back.  May they be tormented through eternity by the ghosts of the murdered.<br>

We came back on Sunday and found everything safe.  Tuesday night Riley (a man we knew on the plains) and Connell came and advised us to leave.  We couldn't get any way to go and had to depend on the Indians.  On Thursday old Whatcom, Seattle's brother, sent his son Charley, with a canoe to take us to Seattle.  Oh, how the rain did pour.  We stayed at Collins that night.<br>
<br>
They didn't give us anything to eat, nor let us make a fire.  Tired out we lay down in our damp clothes, and in the morning had wind and tide to content with.  We got to Seattle at 2 o'clock Friday;met Frank Clark, late of Tacoma, who said we were very foolish to be afraid . My father and husband were going on the jury in about ten days, and stayed to take care of things.<br>
<br>
We meant to come home after court if everything was all right.  After we left my husband lay by the tent one night and heard old Kanasket trying to get old Whatcom to join them in war against the whites.  He offered Whatcom ponies and every other inducement to join them; even said the King George men would help them.  Whatcom said, "No," and said he wouldn't talk to them.<br>
<br>
Old Whatcom tried to get the families that stayed on their places to leave but they wouldn't.  They said they might as well be killed as lose everything.  They started to build a fort in an out-of-the-way place as there was none on the river.<br>
<br>
October 21st I met D.A.Neely. He said he had just brought his family from Tumwater, and was coming up home next day.<br>
<br>
About two hours afterwards Joe Lake came in shot through the shoulder.  He said he knew the neighbors were all killed, he heard shots fired and womens screaming.  Still the sympathizers said, "nonsense." October 22nd, a company of volunteers was organized with H. H. Tobin as captain.  I know positively that there were only four married men in the company They were D.A.Neeley, H. H. Tobin, G. A.Cox, and John M. Thomas.  They came up the river and buried the dead.  Three families were murdered.<br>
<br>
They found Will Brannan on the floor all cut to pieces; found Mrs. Brannan in the well dead with her baby in her arms; Mrs. King was found cut open with her breast cut off; Mrs. Jones was shot through the body and beat with a musket till she was a mass of bruises.  Mr. Jones was sick with typhoid fever at the time.  He and King were burnt up in their houses.  Their bones were picked up and buried with their wives.<br>
<br>
Enos Cooper was found and buried where he fell and his body has<br>
never been removed.  King's baby was never found.  Little George was taken prisoner and brought to Seattle in the spring, after he had been well taken care of by "Spoon Bill" (an Indian).  Mrs. Jones' three children were saved partly by Indian Nelson.  Her oldest child was her first husband's --Johnnie King, 7 years old.  He said Nelson snapped his gun at them three times and it wouldn't
<br>
go off.  He told them to go, they were saved.<br>
<br>
He went to all the settlers houses and found them either gone away or lying dead.  He then went back to his own home and found his mother alive.  She asked him where he was going; he told her to Seattle if he could get there.  She told him to go and "God bless him." He started for the river and met an old Indian, Tom Clutson,(still living and now peddling fish, and well treated by all), who told him to go with him to the camp and he would give him something to eat if he could keep the baby quiet.  He put them under mats and baskets, and kept them till the moon got up, then took them in a canoe well hid to the mouth of the river, then "old David" and Indian who was feeding the hostiles from the man-of-war took them aboard the man-of-war.<br>
<br>
Mother and I took care of them five months, then they were taken back to Ohio by their Uncle Samuel.  On October 28th, a company was organized and C.C. Hewett, was elected captain.  This was a week after the massacre.<br>

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++WHITE RIVER MASSACRE.<br>
<br>
Ezra Meeker, "White River Massacre," <B>Pioneer Reminisences of Puget Sound.</B> Seattle: Lowman and Hanford, 1903, p. 289-303.<br>
<br>
On the very day (October 28, 1855) that Governor Stevens made his final start for home from the Blackfeet council grounds on the Missouri River, a thousand miles distant from his capital, and one day after the killing of McAllister, as related in the last 
chapter, nine persons were massacred on White <B>River, </B>about twenty 
<B>miles south </B>of Seattle.<br>
<br>
These people were peacefully living at their usual homes when the attack was made upon them.  They were killed ruthlessly-men, women and children-with atrocities too vile to describe and mutilations of bodies so often seen in Indian warfare.<br>
<br>
There were three parties that simultaneously attacked the three families so nearly destroyed, whose cabins were separated but short distances on the three claims occupied.  The interveniiag timber shut out from view their neighbors' cabins, and each met their doom without the knowledge of the fate of their neighbors.<br>
<br>
Two of these families Harvey H. Jones and George E. King, I had met on the Yakima crossing about September 8, 1854, and camped with them over night.  As I was the first white man they had seen who
had lived in the country in which they were just then arriving from a wearisome trip across the plains, they naturally plied me diligently with questions and acted upon my advice, and secured valuable claims in the White River valley exactly where I had recommended them to go.<br>
<br>
An amusing incident occurred at the camp that evening of the day we met.  I had just emerged from the mountains going out in search of relatives.  My only companion was a small, white, tailed pony, my 
only food a sack of hard bread, and my only bedding my saddle blanket.<br>
<br>
It was but natural they should invite me to accept their hospitality, to eat at their table and sleep in their tent.  I had experienced great fatigue in the forced march to get out of the mountains, and naturally, after eating heartily, soon became drowsy and amxious for rest.  But the desire for information about the country they were seeking, the conditions of the roads and numerous other matters, was not easily satisfied, and so the volley of questions continued until late in the evening.<br>
<br>
Finally a lull in the conversation came, and I thought my trial at an end, when suddenly Mr. Jones broke the silence with the question: "Can you see the sun rise in that country?" Thinking it wafa an idle question merely with a view to continue the conversation and feeling annoyed and perhaps half vexed that I had not escaped the continuation of the long series of questioning and perhaps with a view of putting an end to it, I answered, before taking a second thought how it would sound, that they could if they were up early enough in the morning.<br>
<br>
This answer, coupled with my manner and tone, brought an awkward pause and embarassment, but the quick wit and tact of the lady, Mrs. Jones, came to the rescue by saying that they had lived in a deep canyon in Wisconsin, where the sun could not be seen until far above the horizon, ending the incident with a hearty laugh all round.<br>
<br>
I never saw these people again, though afterwards have frequently traversed their settlement, and ten years later surveyed their donation land claims and could even at that late date  the remains of their industrious year's labor.  One of them had brought a lot 
<B>of seeds</B> across the 2,000-mile stretch of the plains, with which to plant a nursery.<br>
<br>
The remaing of this nursery could be seen for years as a melancholy remander of the tragic event that cost these people their lives.  The others, W. H. Brennan, wife and child  and Enos Cooper, who<br>
lost their lives, had previously made their homes on an adjoining claim.<br>

Four of the King and Jones children made their escape; three of them speedily reached Seattle by the help of friendly Indians.  Johnny King, as the pioneers have always spoken of him, who rescued the two smaller children, brother and sister, as related by the matured man John I.  King, in the graphic account following.<br>
<br>
This group was taken in Sam Francisco the following spring after the massacre-<br>
<br>
The other illustration on same page [of Mr. Meekers book] is the mother, Mrs.  Jones, who died unattended and uncared for, but whose fortitude had not forsaken her, though wounded and alone, whose dying words were: "Take the chfldren and go to Thomas; I can't live and you may save them." She was a bright, refined lady of superior intelligence, a typical pioneer of a class that deserves a place in history and deserved a better fate.<br>
<br>
The child by her side the reader will readily recognize as the same child, Johnny King, taken when younger and before the trip across the plains.<br>
<br>
The other, a child of 5 years of the name of King, but of another family, escaped from their cabin but was held captive amming the Indians until the following spring, and then delivered to the military officers at Fort Stellacoom.<br>
<br>
The little fellow, George King, could not be properly cared for at the fort, and the commanding officers sent  the child to me, where he stayed long enough to again learn his mother tongue, which he had almost forgotton, and to cease speaking the Indian tongue, which he spoke quite fluently when he was brought in.<br>
<br>
This is the child the Indian who saved him later made an effort to find, with a view to will him his property, worth several thousand 
dollars, as related in <B>full </B>in another chapter, a monument to the 
generous impulse <B>of </B>individuals of the native race.  But he was too late.  The boy was dead, and all his people.<br>
<br>
The eldest of the three John I. King, who was taken to Seattle, is now the only survivor of that terrible day.  He was then seven years old, and is the only witness we have, aside from the Indians, who almost always refuse to give out information about this affair.<br>
<br>
We are fortunate in being able to get the story of this tragic 
event from the <B>only </B>living witness, written expressly for this work by Dr. John I. King, of Martel, Ohio whose memory has served him well all these years, as we know by many corroborating narratives from other soures.<br>
<br>
He says:<br>
<br>
"The Indians were frequent visitors at our house.  They were
'blanket' Indians mostly, and generally very uncouth, unkempt, untidy and repulsive.  As the season of 1855 advanced fhere was an uneasy feeling along the White River valley.  In fact, some two 
weeks previous to the massacre <B>a</B> few families did remove to Seattle.<br>
<br>
On the Friday preceding the outbreak Nelson, one of the chief men of the Indians of the vicinity, came early in the forenoon to visit us, and remained until nearly noon.  I remember that that day he was unusually quiet and uncommunicative.  Mother kept on with her household duties, passing before and around him, as occasion required.<br>
<br>
His talk was mostly in monosyllables, and then only in reply to some question or suggestion.  Finally he left, and said in mixed Indian and English, that it would not be very long until Indian be gone and white man have all the land around here.'<br>
<br>
"When my step-father returned we told him what Nelson had said.  It was an enigma.  It caused us an uneasy evening. I have sometimes thought he was trying as near as he dared  to  give  us  a  warning,  although  some  insist  he  was simply endeavoring to quiet our fears for the purpose of murdering us.<br>
<br>
"The Sunday following Nelson's visit was the 28th day of October, 
<B>1855- </B>My step-father was not well and was in bed in the southwest bed room.  His bed was in the northeast corner of the room.  He is said to have had an attack of pleurisy.  Mother, Enos Cooper, our hired man, my halfsister and my half-brother and myself were at the table eating breakfast.  The table was set in the center of the large room.<br>
<br>
There came a sound from the door, a peculiar noise, but one which we remembered as being made by an Indian.  As I remember, they never rapped at the door, but instead uttered a peculiar grunt or gutteral sound, until some one opened the door.  Mother started for the door, and by the time she reached it we three children were beside her.<br>
<br>
As she opened the door there stood an Indian, but he was not standing at the door; he was standing a little to one side, and as the door was opened more widely he moved still further to the side.  As his action attracted my attention I glanced past him towards the small log house, and was startled to see another Indian, who was standing back of one of the corners of the house, with his gun pointed out between the ends of the logs; his face was to the gun and his hand near the trigger.<br>
<br>
I shall never forget the sight! It seemed as though I was looking directly into the muzzle of the weapon.<br>
<br>
"Mother must have observed it at the same instant, because before I could speak about it she screamed and at the same time seized us
and threw us away from the door, which she closed violently and fastened.  She did all this in an incredibly short time.  It was evidently the intention to shoot whoever should come to the door, and, of course, it would have been natural for them to hope it might be one of the male adults.<br>
<br>
They had skulked upon us while we were at breakfast, because as soon as the door closed there were guns fired and the Warwhoop was given.  I looked out of the southeast window and saw the Indians coming toward the house, whooping and jumping and swinging their tomahawks and gesticulating in an excited manner.<br>
<br>
They seemed to rise out of the ground.  There were a dozen or more in sight when I looked out, but there must have been more a few minutes later.  They were armed with flintlock muskets, which carried an ounce ball and did terrible execution.  They attacked the front of the house and began firing through the door and windows.<br>
<br>
I shall never forget the sickening sensation at the report of the guns, the sound of shivering glass and my realizing sense of utter hopelessness of our situation.  Mother got my step-father's five-
shooter and returned a few shots, but she soon discontinued its use.<br>
<br>
After a time she took us into the northwest bed room and bidding us to get into the northwest corner of the room, as that was the farthest from the point of attack, covered us with a feather bed.  She did this, I suppose, to take advantage of the, fact that it was a difficult matter to send a musket ball through a mass of feathers, especially the old flintlock musket ball.<br>
<br>
I became tired of my confinement and peered cautiously from beneath the bed.  I noticed that the direction of the balls was more upward than horizontal; they were coming through my step-father's room, and tore huge slivers from the partition between the rooms.  These were mostly over his bed.  Waiting a short time I crept along the floor to the door, into the large room.<br>
<br>
Soon my step-father came to his door and was leaning against the left side of the door.  Mother did not seem to have known of his presence there.  I was watching him and  I saw him stagger and lean more heavily against the casing of the door.<br>
<br>
He said: 'Oh, God, I am shot!' Mother turned quickly, and, advancing, said: 'Oh, Harvey, don't say so!' and supported him in her arms.  He opened his shirt front and there was a huge wound near the nipple.<br>
<br>
The ball had come through the front door.  She helped him back to his bed.  I returned to my hiding place.  I shall never forget their parting.  His prayers and advice were mingled with her sobs.  After a time his moans ceased and I knew that he was dead.  I never saw him again.  
In a short time I heard my mother and Mr. Cooper discussing the hopelessness of affairs.  Mother told him that resistance was useless and advised him to attempt to escape.  He came into the room where I was.  With an ax he pried off a window stop and then moved the lower sash.  I saw him hesitate; he looked one way and another, then leaped from the window.<br>
<br>
"A short time after the escape of Cooper there was a lull in the firing.  I noticed steps in the large room which were not my mother's.  Looking again from beneath my hiding place I saw that the rooms were much lighter than before and that the Indians had gained an entrance into the house: one of whom was carrying some bread in his arms.  I was taken outside.<br>
<br>
One of the first I saw was Nelson, who was seated upon a cut from a log turned upon one end, a few feet from the door.  He seemed to be directing the rest what to do.  I was taken to him, as were my sister and brother a few minutes later.  At first I was anxious and afraid, but he told me not to fear; that he could protect me.  I trusted him implicitly, I remember, and assured the children there was no danger, because Nelson had said so.<br>
<br>
They were not as certain of this as I. When or how mother left the house I never knew, nor did I see her after she hid us under the bed until after the Indians left, after burning the house.  Nelson was kind to me, and, as I remember, seemed to talk aside to me, as though he did not want the other Indians to hear him.<br>
<br>
Strangely enough, he told me to go to Mr. Thomas's, where I had gone to school.  The trip was dangerous enough then, as there was only-a path through the woods and the distance was some two miles.  The Indians were carrying out blankets, clothing and other inflammable articles, and stuffing them beneath the house.  They fired these, and thus the house was gotten well ablaze.<br>
<br>
"Nelson dismissed all but one Indian, who, he said, would help me to get to Mr. Thomas's.  After a time Nelson left, and we were then in the care of the Indian.  When it pleased him he started with us.  He had me by the hand, I held sister's, and she in turn was leading our little brother.<br>
<br>
I was surprised at his starting toward the southeast and demurred.  He insisted and kept on.  We began holding back.  He partly led and dragged us to a low place in the fence near the barn, a few rods from the house.  Here he suddenly let go of my hand, and we staggered backward and nearly fell to the ground.<br>
<br>
The Indian petulantly muttered something, which I have now forgotten.  His manner was such as'to lead me to think that he did not care what became of us.  He soon disappeared, and I was alone with the children.  I studied a time what was best to do.  I con-
cluded first to go to a nearer neighbor than Mr. Thomas.  I remember how our house appeared.  
It was consumed, except some of the studding, which was erect and smoking.  The little one-roomed building was burned also; the barn and outbuildings were standing when I left.  Leading the children.  I started for one of our neighbors living toward the south.  I am not sure whether it was Mr. Lake's I had in mind or Mr. Brannan's, but I believe I went to Mr. Brannan's.<br>
<br>
"As I went along I called long, often and loudly upon Mr. Cooper, hoping he might hear me, but I became alarmed at the echo of my calls from the woods, for fear I might attract the attention of any Indians who might be prowling about.  I hadn't gone far until I became convinced I could get along better witbout the children.<br>
<br>
Looking around, I found a roundish depression in the ground, in which I placed them and covered them with brush, charging them to remain there and keep still until I should return.  I hurried to the neighbor's, cautiouslv approaching after I came in sight of the house.<br>
<br>
As I came nearer I saw that the door was open; then that the windows were broken; and upon closer approach that the chairs, tables and other furniture were scattered about, and that the bedticks and pillows were ripped open and the feathers flying about here and there.<br>
<br>
I found no one, either dead or alive, and then made my way back to the children.  I then took them back to the ruins of our home.  We were hungry; we had been driven from the breakfast table.  In the log building had been stored some potatoes, and. several firkins of butter.<br>
<br>
The potatoes were nicely roasted and there were streams of butter from the charred firkins.  I dug some potatoes from the pile and spread some butter upon them, and thus made a satisfactory meal for all of us.  I now thought of making my way to Mr. Thomas's.  I went somewhat circuitously past the barn and woodshed.<br>
<br>
While here a half-grown pup, a great favorite and a very noisy fellow, too, came bounding to me.  The children played with him, and I was at first disposed to" comply with their wishes that we take him with us. On second thought, I knew it would not do, as he would certainly betray our presence should he see an Indian.<br>
<br>
I did what was very hard to do-took a stick and frightened him away.  I shall never forget the expression upon the poor brute's face at this unexpected and unusual treatment.  Going farther, I again called, 'Cooper! Cooper!' But the only answer I received was the pitiful echo from the woods.<br>
<br>
"As I was passing along I unexpectedly came upon my mother, prostrate upon the ground, some hundred feet or so southwest from the remains of our dwelling.  She was yet alive.  I do not know how
or when she came there, nor what was the nature of her injuries.  She was pleased to know we were yet safe, but chided me for my delay in making my escape.<br>
<br>
She told me I must take the children and go to Mr. Thomas's (the same man that Nelson had named a few hours'before).  I did not want to leave her, but she told me it was best-that she could not live, and that I might save the children and myself.  I wanted to remain.<br>
<br>
She explained that if the Indians would come back they would probably kill us all, and that I must go.  With a sad heart and a courage inspired bv mother's charge of responsibility, I made the attempt to do as she bade me.  I never saw her again.<br>
<br>
"Our route lay through heavy timber and dense undergrowth along a path narrow and winding, some two miles as I remember.  When I came to where Mrs. Thomas lived, T went a fourth of a mile or, so farther, to where I expected or hoped to find some white persons, but they were gone.  I went still farther, but could not get near the house because of a cross dog guarding the empty dwelling.  I returned to Mr. Thomas's, not knowing what to do next.<br>
<br>
Mechanically I began retracing my steps to my home.  The children were a constant source of danger to me and themselves.  My little brother was inconsolable; he wanted to go home to see his mother.  He seemed to think I was out upon an expedition of my own and would not go home.<br>
<br>
I could keep my sister quiet by saying 'Indians kill!' but my little brother did not understand the meaning of this, nor how his crying might attract the attention of the Indians, should any be near.  I was becoming tired, as I had carried my brother the greater part of the trip, over three miles or so.  I lacked about two weeks of being 7 years old, sister was not quite 4, and brother was not quite 2 years of age.<br>
<br>
It was getting late in the afternoon of a day late in the fall.  They, and I too, were getting hungry, and I had nothing to give them or eat myself, except bark and an edible root which mother at one time showed me.  I was in danger from Indians and wild animals and as far as I knew, some twenty miles from a white settlement.  An almost overwhelming sense of my danger and helplessness came over me as I thought of t.he coming night.  But I trudged on.<br>
<br>
Glancing along the path, to my consternation I saw an Indian coming towards us. From his manner I felt sure he had neither seen nor heard us.  My first thought was for the safety of the children.  It flashed through my mind that they might be ransomed if captured.<br>
<br>
With this idea in mind I hastened into the underbrush, secreted them, charged them to remain quiet, and then ran diagonally back to the path nearer the Indian than where I left.  I hoped in case he
killed me he would spare the children.  As we came nearer I recognized him as an Indian I had frequently seen while attending school at Mr. Thomas's.<br>
<br>
The school began the 27th of July that summer.  We called him Tom.  I told him of the massacre.  He said he suspected something of the kind, as he had heard firing in that direction.  He told me that I should get the children and take them to his wigwam, adding that 'when the moon was high' he would take us to Seattle in his canoe.<br>
<br>
His squaw was as kind and amiable as could be, and did all in her power to make it pleasant for us, but the children were very shy.  She set out dried fish and whortleberries for our repast, but nothing she could do would induce them to go to her.  Our hunger was so great that the various and penetrating odors permeating the food she had brought us was no bar to our relish for it as I remember.<br>
<br>
"A short time after we went there I had left the tent.  I heard a cracking of brush near by.  I turned.  The squaw had followed me to have me return to quiet the children.<br>
<br>
After I had gotten them calmed, she spread a huge bearskin upon the ground (floor), of the tent, and soon we were all sound asleep.  Some time during the night I was awakened by some one tugging at my shoulder.<br>
<br>
Tom stood over me and said it was time to go.  The moon 'was high,' because it was shining brightly down through the circular hole at the top or peak of the wigwam.  I was sleepy, and the children positively cross; they were 'dead for sleep.' I made out to get them loaded into the canoe, and we started for Seattle.  Near the mouth of the Duwamish River we were delivered to another Indian, 'Dave,' who headed for the sloop-of-war Decatur, lying in Elliot Bay, detailed there for the protection of that part of the Coast.<br>
<br>
She was a little over 500 tons burden, and carried sixteen guns.  She was built in 1838, and at the time of which I speak, was in command of Capt.  Sterrett.  Dave delivered us to the marines, and we were taken on board by them.  He laughed heartily at me as we came within hailing distance of the sloop because I dropped flat to the bottom of the canoe, thinking I was to be shot.<br>
<br>
An officer had drawn a long glass on us for the purpose of making out what kind of an outfit we had.  We were afterwards taken to a family in Seattle by the name of Russell, and Dr. Maynard appointed guardian.  Subsequently a Mr. Buckley and a Mr. Neeley seemed to have us in charge.<br>
<br>
The children remained on shore while I was on shipboard.  I daily went ashore and returned nights the greater part of the time we were in Seattle.  About May 25, 1856, my uncle, John Smail, came
and took us to our old home in Wisconsin.<br>
<br>
"There was a large two-story block house in Seattle, and a stockade for the protection of the people against attack by the Indians.  This building stood facing the hill back of Seattle, and had a door in the front left-hand corner.  The back of the building faced the bay in front of the town.<br>
<br>
The sloop-of-war Decatur lay in the bay usually.  As was my custom, 
I <B>was </B>ashore nearly all day every day.  On Saturday, January 26, 1856, I came ashore as usual.  A short time after I reached the fort that day the Indians attacked Seattle.<br>
<br>
They were principally upon the hill back of the town. I shall never forget the occasion.  The people sought safety in flight into the fort.  Small arms were being used on shore, and the Decatur was shelling the hill.  The order came to keep clear of the port holes and of the door.<br>
<br>
One young man (a Mr. Holgate, I believe), defied the Indians and disobeyed orders, too, standing in the open door.  In a short time 
he was shot in the <B>face.  </B> I was terribly frightened, sick and faint with fear.  I begged and pleaded and insisted on being taken to the Decatur.<br>
<br>
Finally, a small outlet was made at the back of the fort, and, giving my usual signal, a gig came to take me aboard.  One saucy three-inch howitzer was planted on the beach, and the large guns of the Decatur were sending shot and shell over my head, but I preferred the crack of the small brass piece and the roar and boom of the guns to staying in the fort.<br>
<br>
Bullets occasionally dropped near us, but when on shipboard I was well beyond the range of the Indian muskets.  When I came aboard the Decatur, in October, Capt.  Sterrett was in command.  A short time after this he was relieved, and at the time of the attack, in January, 1856, Capt.  Ganzevoort was in command."<br>

<br>
The  following  letter  from  Capt.  C.  C.  Hewitt  supplies<br>
the snuel to this melancholy event:<br>
<br>
"Seattle, November 5, 1855<br>
<br>
Mr.  Editor: I have just returned from the scene of the late massacre, on White River, about thirty or thirty five miles from this place, and will proceed to give you a brief statement of the transaction.<br>
<br>

<B><br>

"On  </B>Sunday  evening,  October  28,  a  young  man  by   the
name  of  Lake  came  to  this  place  with  two  families  (Mr.<br>
Cox and Mr. Kirkland), and reported that he had been shot at and wounded while standing within the door of Mr. Cox, and heard guns and screams in the direction of some of the other neighbors.<br>
<br>
This was about 7 o'clock in the same morning.  I immediately 
mustered forty men and four Northern Indians, and at <B>11 </B>o'clock Monday morning started for the scene of action with such guns and outfit as we could command.  After two days hard work we reached the house of Mr. Cox, which we found robbed, confirming our suspicion that greater mischief had been done to the settlements farther up the river.<br>
<br>
We then proceeded to Mr. Jones's place, where we found our worst fears more than realized.  The house was burned to ashes, and Mr. Jones, who was sick at the time, was burned in it. Mrs. Jones we found lying near the house, shot through the lower part of the lungs, face and jaw horribly broken, and mutilated apparently with the head of an ax.<br>
<br>
We found Mr.  Cooper, who was living with Mr. Jones at the time, 
about <B>150 </B>yards from the house, shot through the lungs, the ball entering the left breast.  We buried the bodies and proceeded to the house of W. H. Brannan, a mile distant.  Mrs. Brannan and child we found in the well, her head downwards.  The mother was stabbed to the heart, the knife entering the lower part of the left breast, and also in the back and back of the head.<br>
<br>
She had apparently started to run with her child, an infant of 10 months old, in her arms, was overtaken and pitched into the well.  The child was below her and bore no marks of violence on it. It was not dressed, showing that the mother had taken it from the bed and attempted to flee.<br>
<br>
"Mr.  Brennan was found in the house, literally cut to pieces.  The left hand had two cuts, as though he had grasped a knife and had it pulled out, cutting the hand to the bone.  There were also two stabs in the palm of the hand, as though he had attempted to ward off the fatal weapon.  His arms and legs were badly cut, and I think there were as many as fifteen stabs in his back, mostly a little below the left shoulder.<br>
<br>
Everything seemed to show that he fought desperately, and I think he must have killed some of the devils from the fact that the fence, where they went out, from the house, had the appearance of having something dragged over it, and the rails below were all smeared with blood.<br>
<br>
"After burying them as well as circumstances would permit, we proceeded to the house of Mr. King, or, rather, where his house was, which we found burned to ashes, and where the most horrible spectacle of all awaited us.<br>

"I am told by a black man whom we met about three miles below our encampment, that, on reaching the opposite side of the river from where we stopped, he saw five Indians, part of whom he knew, from whom he learned that there were 150 Indians prowling about my encampment  the evening before.  The supposition is that they had collected their forces to make an attack.<br>
<br>
If they had done so, they might have done us considerable damage, as onethird of our guns were entirely inefficient.  The next time I go up White River I shall be better prepared.  Yours<br>
<br>
C. C. HEWITT.<br>
etc.<br>
<br>
P. S. Three    children    of    Mr.    Jones    were    saved.    The a half-Klickitat, told him to take the other two and go elder, an adopted son about 7 years old, says that Nelson,<br>
down to John Thomas's, a distance of about two miles, which he did.  Mr. Thomas and family having fled to Seattle, they were discovered by a friendly Indian and brought to town.  The boy says he did not know any of the Indians<br>
but Nelson."C. C. H."<br>
<br>
The following statement was found among the correspondence on Me in the adjutant general's office at Olympia, without date or signature, indorsed as follows:,<br>
<br>
"Statement of Indian at Seattle, relation to murders committed on White River.<br>
<br>
"Statement of Monish to me:<br>
<br>
"I come to Seattle-Mr.  Holderness had a bear, wanted something for it.  Returned up the river a little above the Dutchman's; tied his canoe and slept.  At midnight of the day he was at the 
fishery at Pupschulk (John Thomas,); went <B>a </B>little way up the road; saw the tenas man (young Jones--as Johnny King was known by those not acquainted with the family-- coming down the road (I may be mistaken as to his being but one night on the river; he is positive as to the being at Pupschulk at sitkum sun), (at noon).<br>
<br>
He saw the Klickitats and was told Nelson killed with a knife either William (Brennan) or William's wife, and that Jones was killed in bed with an arrow.  That the Klickitats took his canoe, as Leschi was on horseback: that he stayed at the fishery four days, and then came down on foot through the woods to Alki; that the Indians would not take him in their canoes, and that he stayed at Alki some time, and a short time since got over to Capt.  Howard's mill."<br>
<br>
The importance of this interview is that it fixes the
responsibility of the massacre in part at least on the Klickitats and locates Leschi "on horseback" a few hours after the occurrence and between the field of the massacre and Seattle.<br>
<br>
To many this will fix in their minds the responsibility of Leschi's participation in this tragedy.<br>
<br>
Leschi, as we have seen, had established his camp on Green River three days before, after his narrow escape from capture by the Eaton Rangers who were sent to his home for the purpose of forcibly removing him to Olympia and not more than eight miles up that river, and doubtless within the sound of the guns that destroyed the Settlements, and he naturally would have ridden in  haste to the field.<br>
<br>
Subsquent events have proven that he did not approve taking the 
lives <B>of </B>noncombatants, and so we may probably believe he did not 
participate in this outrageous  destruction <B>of </B>innocent lives.<br>
<br>
But the reader can judge of the probabilities as well as the author, having all the facts obtainable before him.<br>

WHITE RIVER MASSACRE.<br>
<br>
Archie Binns, "The Massacre," <B>Northwest Gateway.</B> Garden City, New York: Doubleday, Doran and Company, 1941, p. 108-123.<br>
<br>
The clearing in the forest of the rich White River Valley was about twenty miles from Seattle. The original building was a one room log cabin.<br>
<br>
Harvey Jones had built it the first year, when he was getting started.  The log cabin was now used as a storeroom and the family lived in the new frame house a few rods to the north.  There were Mr and Mrs Jones, Johnny King, who was by Mrs Jones's first marriage and going on seven, and the Joneses' children: a girl of not quite four and a boy of not quite two.<br>
<br>
There was also Enos Cooper, who had the adjoining claim and helped Mr Jones with his work.  For neighbors there were the Brannans and Mr Lake and the Thomases.  The Thomas claim was farther away than the others, but it was familiar because that was where Johnny King went to school.<br>
<br>

For neighbors there were also the Indians.  They were generally dirty and rough mannered.  Instead of knocking they would make questioning grunts until someone opened the door and let them in.  Then they would sit around for a while, visiting and eating anything Mrs Jones offered them.  Their chief was a stocky man known as Nel-
son.  He did not look much like a chief, with his dirty blanket and unbraided hair, but he was friendly in a restrained fashion.<br>
<br>
He spoke some English and was decidedly intelligent.  If he resented Harvey Jones and Cooper as intruders on the land of his people, he had less resentment for Mrs Jones, and still less for the children, with their diminishing and vanishing degrees of responsibility.  And Nelson was dependable; when Mrs Jones heard his distinctive grunt outside the door she knew almost to the minute how long he would visit; and she knew what he liked to cat and how he would act and what he would talk about.<br>
<br>
But when he called on Friday, the twenty-sixth of October, 1855, Nelson did not run true to form.  That was a few weeks after the settlers' flight to Seattle and their return.  Mrs Jones was baking bread in the Dutch oven, a loaf at a time.  One loaf was already done, and bread was the favorite delicacy of the Indians, but when she offered him some he grunted, "Wake" (No); and he continued to sit on the bench, looking into the fire, with his Hudson's Bay flintlock musket leaning against the stone-and-clay fireplace.<br>
<br>
When Mrs Jones asked if he had been hunting, he said, "Wake." It was like that with all her attempts at conversation, until she saw there was no communicating with him.  Instead of staying his usual half-hour he appeared in the morning, just after Mr Jones and Cooper went out to cut wood, and he stayed until almost noon, when the men might be expected home to eat.<br>
<br>
Whatever the purpose of his visit, it was for the benefit of the woman and her children.  When Nelson was at the door, going away, he said, "Soon Siwash will be gone and Bostons will have all the land here."<br>
<br>
Harvey Jones did not come home until late, and he and his wife could not decide what had been in the chief's mind.  Jones had caught cold during the day, and at the end of that uneasy evening he went to bed complaining of a knifelike pain in one side of his chest.<br>
<br>
On Sunday morning Jones was suffering from an attack of pleurisy and unable to leave his bed.  Enos Cooper did the chores and came in to have breakfast with Mrs Jones and the children.  The table was in the center of the large room, which served as kitchen, dining and living room.<br>
<br>
Two bedrooms opened off the large room, and Harvey Jones was in bed 
in the southwest room at the front of the house.<br>
<br>
They had just sat down  to eat when there was a questioning guttural sound outside the front door.  Mrs Jones got up, and by the time she opened the door her three children were beside her.  A strange Indian was there, standing a little to one side of the doorway.  As the door opened wider he moved farther to the side.  Johnny King looked past him, toward the one-room log house, and saw another Indian.<br>
<br>
The Indian was partly behind a corner of the log house, with his musket pointed out between the end of the logs.  The child stared at the face pressed against the musket stock, and he looked, frozen, into the big-bore muzzle of the weapon.  Then he and the smaller children were hurled from the doorway.  The door crashed shut,<br>
and the mother barred it.  That all happened in the twinkling of an eye, and the little boy's chief amazement was at the explosive power and speed of his gentle mother.<br>
<br>
He heard yells and the banging of muskets and the crash of glass while he was still sprawled on the floor.  When he got up and looked out of the front window he saw a dozen Indians charging on the house, waving hatchets and muskets.  He saw his mother, with the father's five-shooter, aiming through the shattered window.  He saw her white face and heard the sharp explosions of the revolver as the room dimmed with blue powder smoke.  Outside there was the yelling of the Indians and the heavy, sickening explosions of muskets.<br>
<br>
Johnny saw his mother lay the empty pistol on the table. She looked outside and around the smoky room and at the whimpering children, deciding what she was going to do. Then she gathered the children together and took them to the back bedroom.  She had them lie down in the northwest corner, which was farthest from the point of attack, and covered them with a feather bed.<br>
<br>
It was dark and stuffy under the feather bed, and Johnny could not see what was going on, though he could hear the banging of muskets and bullets crashing into the house.  He looked from under the bed and saw holes burst in the partition between the bedrooms and big splinters flying off the wood.  The bullets were piercing the parti-
tion above the stepfather's bed on the other side.<br>
<br>
They went out of the opposite wall, making clean, round holes higher up, as if fired from near the ground.  When the boy saw that the musket balls were passing well above the bed where the children were hiding, he crept along the floor, into the big room.  He saw his stepfather come to the door of the other room and lean against the door frame.  He was dressed but looked white and ill.  The mother did not seem to notice him there.<br>
<br>
While the boy watched there was the splintering sound of a musket
ball coming through the front door, and the stepfather staggered and leaned more heavily against the door frame.  He called', "Oh, God, I am shot!"<br>
<br>
The mother ran to him saying, "Oh, Harvey, don't say so!" She supported him in her arms while he unbuttoned his shirt.  There was a huge wound near his right nipple.  She helped him back to bed and Johnny crawled back to the other children.  From the other side of the partition he heard the parting of his mother and step father; the man's advice broken by the woman's sobbing, and the voices of both broken by the sound of firing and the crash of musket balls through the partition.<br>
<br>
Then the man's voice changed to moaning, which stopped in a little while.<br>
<br>
After that the boy heard his mother telling Cooper that it was hopeless to try to defend the house; he had better look out for himself and try to escape.  The boy did not hear what the neighbor said, but in a little while he heard footsteps in the room.  Looking from under the feather bed he saw Cooper pry off a window stop with his ax and take out the sash.  He hesitated at the window, open to dubious freedom, looking to the east and to the west.  Then he crouched, with one foot on the sill, and leaped out of the child's sight forever.<br>
<br>
Soon the sound of firing stopped and the boy heard unfamiliar steps in the big- room.  When he looked, light was coming into the room and an Indian was carrying loaves of bread in his arms.  Another Indian came in and took the boy by the hand and led him out.  The south wall of the big room looked flimsy and dead,'riddled with holes, and its door and smashed window open to the raw November morning.<br>
<br>
There were more Indians outside; Nelson was sitting on an upturned cut from a log in the yard, directing them.  He was not silent and morose as he had been on his last visit to the house, and he seemed to know just what must be done.  The boy was afraid of him now, and afraid of what would happen to the younger children in the house.  But Nelson patted his shoulder and spoke kindly, "All <B>right, N</B>elson don't let them hurt you."<br>
<br>
Johnny wasn't afraid any more, and when the other children were brought out of the house he told them everything would be all right because Nelson had said so.  But the younger children still whimpered.  They did not like what was going on and they knew the Indians had something to do with it.  The Indians were carrying out the family's blankets and clothes and stuffing them under the house.<br>

Nelson kept Johnny beside him, and when the other Indians were out of hearing he talked to him with guarded kindness and told him to take the little children to Mr Thomas's.  While he talked, smoke came up from under the house, and the house began to burn.  The small log house was also burning.  The boy did not know any of the Indians except Nelson, whom he trusted completely.<br>
<br>
When the house was blazing, Nelson sent all the Indians away except one.  The remaining one, he said, would go with the children to the Thomases'.<br>
<br>
Johnny watched the burning house for a while, and when he looked around for Nelson the chief was gone.  The three children were alone with the strange Indian.  The Indian was surly and he was in no hurry to go with the children.  He stayed until the roof of the house fell in with a crash and an angry shower of sparks.  Then he picked up his flintlock musket and started with the children.  He took Johnny's hand, and Johnny took his sister's hand, and the sister took the little brother's hand.<br>
<br>
The Thomas claim was to the northwest, and the Indian started to the southeast.  Johnny objected that they were going the wrong way and held back. The sister saw that  her brother had no faith in their guide and she objected and held back still more.  The little brother knew that something was very wrong and he wailed and did not want to go at all.<br>
<br>
But the Indian insisted, leading and dragging the string of children after him.  He got them almost as far as the fence near the barn.  There was a low place in the fence, and he was going to take them over the fence into the woods.  The children objected to crossing that boundary in the wrong direction and they held back with all their combined weight.  The Indian muttered impatiently and let go the boy's hand so suddenly that the string of children staggered back and nearly. fell.  Then he went away.<br>
<br>
They stood there for a while and the boy tried to decide what he should do.  Nelson had told him to go to the Thomases' but that was a long way, and it would mean crossing the lonely clearing where the Indians had been.  Johnny decided to go to the Brannans', which was much nearer and toward the south.<br>
<br>
He could not go any faster than the four-year-old sister, and she could not go any faster than the two-year-old brother, who was hungry and did not care about walking at all.  Johnny saw it would take a long time to get them even to the nearest neighbor's and he decided to leave them and go alone for help.  Near the trail he found a hollow in the ground.  He put the younger children in there
and told them the Indians would kill them if they made any noise.  Then he covered them over with brush and hurried along the trail alone.<br>
<B><br>
Cautiously </B>after he was in sight of the Brannans' house, and when he came in better view he saw that the door was open and the windows broken.  There did not seem to be anyone about, and he went still closer.  Furniture was scattered in the yard, and feather beds and pillows were ripped open, their feathers drifting idly about the household wreckage.<br>
<br>
The boy walked around the house, but he did not find anyone, alive or dead.  He went back to the other children.<br>
<br>
The attack had come as they were beginning breakfast; it was now the middle of the day and all of them were hungry.  Johnny led the children back to the ruins of their home.  Everything had been burned, but in the remains of the log cabin they found a meal waiting for them.  Potatoes and firkins of butter had been stored there.  The potatoes were nicely roasted, and streams of melted butter ran from the charred firkins.<br>
<br>
The boy smeared butter on some of the roasted potatoes, and the three of them had a good meal.<br>
<br>
With hot food inside of him, Johnny's resolution came back and he decided to take the children to Mr Thomas's, as Nelson had directed.  He led them round about, circling the ruins of the house by way of the barn and woodshed, which had not been burned.  Near the woodshed the children's half-grown puppy came bounding up to them.  The younger children romped with him and were happy.<br>
<br>
They had been well fed and now they had their favorite pet.  When Johnny said they must go on, they wanted to take the puppy with them.  The boy thought it would be fine to have him for company.  Then he decided it would not do at all to attract the attention of any Indians within hearing.  He took a stick and drove the puppy away, when he wanted to carry it in his arms.<br>
<br>
A little farther along the boy was surprised to see his mother lying on the ground in the clearing, a hundred feet or so from the ruins of the house.  She was alive and the boy did not see any sign of injury, but she did not try to get up.  The mother was pleased to see the children still alive and unhurt, but she reproached Johnny for dawdling.  He must go at once, she said, and take the children to Mr Thomas's.<br>
<br>
He wanted to stay with her, but she told him she could not live, but if he went. at once he could save himself and the children.  He did not want to leave her, but she said if the Indians came back they would kill everyone.  He was responsible for the children now, she
said, and he must do his best to save them.  He promised and went on into the woods with the other children.  He never saw his mother again.<br>
<br>
Because of what his mother had said, Johnny made up his mind not to leave the others again.  But it was two miles to the neighbor's house, and he had to lug the two-year old in his arms most of the way.<br>
<br>
The Thomases' house had not been disturbed, but the family was gone and the door locked.  Nelson and the boy's mother could not have known that when they told him to take the children there.  There was another neighbor a quarter of a mile farther to the north.  Johnny set out for there, lugging the heavy two-year-old and letting his little sister get along as best she could.<br>
<br>
Sometimes he put the baby down to catch his breath  and  rest  his  breaking arms, but the baby would do so little walking and so much crying that as soon as he could the boy would pick him up and stagger on with him.  Sometimes the four-year-old, stumbling along the trail, would whimper and start to cry.  Then Johnny would say warningly, "Indians kill! "<br>
<br>
But it did not help any with the two-year-old, who did not understand the meaning of the words or of their dismal journey through the forest.<br>
<br>
Coming into the last clearing they heard the barking of a dog.  The house looked shut up and the boy did not see anyone about.  As the children approached, the dog ran out and barked at them, crossly, and would not let them come any closer.  The baby cried that he was hungry, and the little sister whimpered, and the boy who was not quite seven stood there, trying to decide what he should<br>
do next.<br>
<br>
Most of the day he and the younger children had been wandering in the dark forest and about ransacked or deserted houses.  The only white person they had seen was their mother, dying in the clearing near their burned house.  Now they were at the end of the world the boy knew, with a cross dog guarding the empty house where they might have stopped to rest.<br>
<br>
He could not go any farther, so he started back.  When the children complained more of hunger, he dug an edible root that his mother had once showed him, and later he got some bark for himself and the others, stripping it off the branches with his teeth.  The bark and roots helped a little, but they were still hungry and they were exhausted.<br>

In the Thomases' deserted clearing a feeling of over<B>whelming<br>
</B>and helplessness came over the boy. It was near the end of the late autumn day, and everything he had been told to do, or tried by himself, had failed.  Everyone in the settlement was dead or gone-everyone but himself and the exhausted and hungry little children and night was coming on.  He did not know what to do, but he had to do something; so he started back, mechanically, toward the ruins of home.<br>
<br>
After a time, looking ahead, Johnny saw an Indian coming toward them along the dusk of the trail.  The younger children were being quiet for once, and he did not think the Indian saw or heard them.  He carried the baby into the woods, with the little sister following.  Before she had time to notice that they were off the . trail he was hiding the children in the underbrush and whispering for them to stay where they were and keep quiet or "Indians kill." Then he ran back, diagonally, to the trail.<br>
<br>
Most of the day Johnny had been in fear of meeting an Indian.  Now an Indian seemed their only hope of being saved.  He thought that even if the Indian killed him, the others would be no worse off.  He could do no more for them without help.  When the Indian came closer, the boy recognized him.  He was Tom, whom the boy had often seen at the Thomases' when he was attending school.  He was not afraid any more and hurried forward to meet the Indian.<br>
<br>
Tom was not surprised when the boy told him of the attack.  He had heard hiyu shooting that morning.  He said it was not a good time for Boston children to be wandering in the woods.  Johnny must get the tenas men and take them to Tom's house.<B> </B>When the moon was high he would take them to Seattle.<br>
<br>
Tom's house was beside the White River, a few hundred yards away, but without a guide the children would never have found it.  It was a hut of poles and mats, with a hole in the top by way of a chimney.  It had fleas and smelled vividly of fish, but it was a fine, secure house with a fire in it, and orphaned children were never made more welcome.<br>
<br>
Tom's squaw set out high-smelling smoked salmon and berries that had been smoked, to discourage insects, and dried.  It was tough, strong-smelling food, but even the baby ate with relish.<br>
<br>
By the time the children had finished eating they were falling asleep.  Tom's squaw spread the skin of a big black bear on the ground in the hut.  The children fell on it as if they had been shot and slept like the dead.<br>
<br>
Johnny was awakened from the sleep of exhaustion by someone shaking
him by the shoulder.  When he opened his unwilling eyes the moon was shining brightly through the circular hole at the top of the hut.  His little brother and sister were sleeping beside him on the black bearskin in the moonlight, and Indian Tom was bending over him. <B>"It </B>is time," Tom said.  "We go now."<br>
<br>
Half asleep, the boy helped rouse the smaller children, who cried bitterly and fought against being disturbed.  In a sleepwalking state he got them to the river.  Tom steadied his dugout canoe while Johnny got the children into the light, nervous craft.  Then he and Tom got in and they started for Seattle, down the moonlit river that wound through the black forest.<br>
<B><br>
The late November night </B>was frosty cold, and the children were dressed as they had been when they sat down to breakfast that morning-which seemed ages ago.  When they were no longer disturbed they fell asleep in the bottom of the canoe, huddled against their older brother.  They woke, crying with the cold.<br>
<br>
Johnny did his best to hold them in his arms for mutual warmth; but he, too, was shaking with the cold and he did not give or receive much warmth.  While he was trying to comfort the shivering children and quiet the chattering of his own teeth a blanket was pushed forward beside him.  He spread it over and around the three of them, with only his head looking out.<br>
<br>
Warmth began to grow under the tent of the blanket, and the little children quieted while the canoe pushed on faster down the cold river of moonlight.  Johnny looked at Tom; he was naked to the waist and paddling vigorously to keep from freezing.  <B>Later, </B>when the children woke and cried with hunger, he handed them four cold boiled potatoes, all the food he had in the canoe.<br>
<br>
Early in the morning they came to where the broadened river was split by an island.  The dugout followed the right fork, with Tom paddling harder and the canoe going more slowly.  "Salt chuck," he grunted.  The river fork met; luminous gray waters that seemed to open away forever from the one remaining shore ahead.  The shore went up rapidly to high hills, and beyond the forest, on the hills, the morning was breaking gray and somber.<br>
<br>
A mile or two ahead a ship was lying at -anchor off a little peninsula.  It was a great black ship with the muzzles of many cannons poking out of the gun ports in her sides. <B>Above there were three</B> towering masts, with black yards, like crosses, against the somber sky of morning.<br>
<br>
The peninsula off which the ship was lying was like a high island, connected with the mainland by a strip of beach.  On the high part of the peninsula and on the mainland were the houses of a village.<br>
<br>

"Seattle," Tom said.  He was paddling easily, with the canoe standing still in the mouth of the river, as if he were waiting for something.  Then Johnny saw another canoe, paddled by an Indian, coming toward them.  Tom and the stranger exchanged a few words, and the canoes drifted together.<br>
<br>
In the boy's nostrils there was the strange, exciting smell of salt water.  The breeze of dawn was fresh and stinging cold, and the water danced as if every little sharp wave were tingling with life.<br>
<br>
The canoes lay alongside each other and the strange Indian lifted the sleeping children into his canoe.  Johnny followed them, and while he was getting settled the canoes drifted apart-, Tom was paddling back into the mouth of the river, with his regained blanket about him.  Johnny never saw him again.<br>
<br>
Their new guide was named Dave, and he was good natured and at home on the salt chuck, and not at all afraid.  He paddled directly for the warship.<br>
<br>
The morning the three children were brought to the Decatur an expedition started for the White River valley.  There were forty Seattle volunteers and four Northern Indians under Captain Hewitt.  Traveling through the woods it took them two days to reach the settlement from which Tom had brought the children in one night.<br>
<br>
At the Cox claim  they  found  the  house  broken  into  and<br>
robbed. Farther up the river they found Jones  house burned to the ground and Harvey Jones cremated with it.  The body of Mrs Jones was lying near the ashes of the house, where she had given Johnny his final instructions.  She had been shot through the lungs at the time.  Later, as she had feared, the Indians had come back and dispatched her with an ax.  Enos Cooper was lying in the field, a hundred and fifty yards from where he had jumped out of the window, with a musket ball through his heart.<br>
<br>
A mile or so from the Jones claim the volunteers came to the Brannan house, round which Johnny had wandered in search of help without finding anyone dead or alive.  The volunteers did not find anyone alive, but they found Brannan hacked to pieces in the house, where he had put up a desperate fight, and they found the body of Mrs<br>
Brannan in the well with her ten-month-old baby.<br>
<br>
Farther on they found the King house burned to ashes and three of the family butchered; and, to the confusion of history, a five-year-old boy, George King, had been carried away by the Indians.  He was not related to Johnny King.<br>
<br>
The volunteers buried the dead and went back to Seattle without
meeting any Indians, hostile or friendly.  But on the river they met a mysterious black man who told them that the night before their camp had been surrounded by a hundred and fifty Indians.  Hewitt was pleased that they had not attacked his forty-four men, partly because fifteen of the volunteers' rifles were disabled relics carried for moral effect.<br>

Battle of White River.<br>
<br>
Ezra Meeker, "The Battle of White River," <B>Pioneer Reminiscences of Puget Sound.</B> Seattle: Lowman and Hanford, 1903, p. 309-316.<br>
<br>
Following the killing of McAllister and Connell, on the 27th, the massacre on White Mver the 28th, and the ambushing of the express riders on the 31st there came a general concentration of the Indian hostile forces at Connell's Prairie and Green River.<br>
<br>
By this time fully one hundred and fifty fighting men had assembled and had to be fed besides numerous women and children. Fish abounded in all the streams at that time  of the year, and if interrupted at one place the  women could find the salmon abundant elsewhere. Here was the spectacle of an army with strongholds large the field to  be occupied, with food in all parts, even up to the most impenetrable forests of the foothills.<br>
<br>
It is astonishing how abundaut these salmon are found in the small streams and even rivulets of the headwaters <B>of </B>the greater rivers below.  Besides, at this juncture, the Indians had abundance of stocky driven from the farms in the valley below.<br>
<br>
One thing only disturbed the Indians for the time being. They were short of ammunition and deficient in effective arms, and they could not be replenished.  The food could be obtained for many months, and even a supply accumulated for the later season when the salmon would disappear from the streams.<br>
<br>
When the final end came considerable supplies were captured and destroyed, silent witnesses of the industry and determined co-operation of the  women in, to them, this great struggle.<br>
<br>
Another element of weakness was the lack of any central authority to unify the forces.  Three main tribes contributed the greater number of warriors; the Nisquailies, Puyallups, White River or Duwamigh
Indians.  Besides, each of these tribes was divided up into numerous bands or families, that acknowledged no central authority, or if any, at best but the most shadowy.<br>
<br>
The morale of this little army at its incoming gathering was high, as the Indians were flushed with what appeared to them as victories; many of them not realiz<B>ing </B>the serious work before them.  The efficiency of the individuals comprised in the gathering was very low.  Only about one-third of the number, not over fifty in all, were to be relied on for effective work.  The fish Indians, as a rule, are poor shots, arrant cowards and desperite shirks.<br>
<br>
Like Dr. Burns, who, when he was found with his head stuck in a barley stack, broke forth into a volume of brag, insisting he had killed seven Indians, and exhibited a piece of salmon skin for a scalp; so with the cowards of the Indians, they could talk loud without the presence of an enemy, but run fast where damger was apprehended, or shirk in the brush on the most trivial pretense.<br>
<br>
Leschi had a serious task before him to organize this force into any sort of a fighting machine.  He had but thirty-one of his own tribe.  I have secured the names of all but one, and all are dead but three.  They comprised a force that would obey his command, execute his orders with alacrity amd remained faithful to the last.  His brother, Quiemuth, was of this force.  His brother-in-law (Stahl), was killed in battle and the only one of this company lost during the whole war.<br>
<br>
Daniel Mounts, yet living, had the charge of these Indians for five years after their return, and is authority for this remarkable statement and which is doubtless true.  This one instance alone will illustrate better than words could paint the enormous disadvantage under which troops labored working an aggressive campaign. An Indian could fire  from behind a log or tree or an upturned root,<br>
drop to the ground <B> an</B>d be completely concealed by the low brush (the salal), so general in this country.<br>
<br>
Their policy from the start was that of a defensive war.  This was a wise course to adopt, but difficult to enforce when the enemy drew off and left the field, as occurred so soon.  It is doubtful if the force collected at this time would have ever been consolidated had not <B>an </B>unexpected and serious emergency suddenly confronted them.<br>
<br>
While the jealous wranglings between petty chiefs were at their height, and discontent arising from Leschi's stern rebuke for the massacre on White River, there suddenly came upon them the vangaurd of Maloney's returning expedition.  The Indians barely had time to get their main forces across the river before Maloney's command of 243 men were in full possession of the prairie without firing a gun.<br>
<br>
This was on the second of November, two days after the express
riders had been ambushed and two of them killed.<br>
<br>
The contention of the chiefs suddenly ceased, and many of the men skulked to the brush.  All eyes were turned to Leschi.  He became commander of all the forces without a formal agreement. When the time came he went to the front in person andd asked no one to take any risks in which he and his <B>immediate</B> followers were not willing to share.<br>
<br>
The testimony of the Indians to this is <B>unanimous</B>.  He was a good shot and always calm in the presence of the enemy, and inspired confidence among his followers by his example.  After the first battle, presently to be described, there were no more questions raised as to who should command, as all were only too willing to have him take the lead.<br>
<br>
On the 3rd  Maloney sent fifty regulars  under  Lieut. Slaughter,  and  fifty  volunteers  under  Capt.  Hays,   to track the Indians, <B>and </B>soon found them posted on the right bank of White River.<br>
<br>
The river at this point for miles both above and below, in a roaring torrent, impomible to ferry, and could not be forded except in very few places, and at these, not when the river was high, as it was at that time.  The valley is was filled with drift wood on either side the river, and without soil-a barren waste of rounded boulders and sand with numerous sand baxs.<br>
<br>
An attempt made to fall a tree upon which to cross resulted in the loss of a man, shot dead upon the spot, and was abandoned as the Indian sharp shooters could not be dislodged, or in fact, discovered.  The firing at long range became quite general, the aim usually into a brush patch from which a puff of smoke had been seen.<br>
<br>
The Indians made a very poor showing, as many of their men were skulking in the thickets and did not come on the firing line at all.<br>
The bluffs on either side of the river are five or six hundred feet above the water level, are very steep, and in some places almost perpendicular.  To the rear of the Indians two miles distant, the Green River runs in as deep a cut as the stream upon which the opposing forces were contending.<br>
<br>
Four miles above the battle ground a good crossing of White River was known to both forces, on the only wagon road in the near vicinity.  A good trail led down hill with the right bank of the river, but on the bluff to the rear of the Indians under the steep hill.  Towards noon the Indians began to drift off from the firing line and go up the hill, where there was something for them to eat, but then forgot to go back and skulked.<br>
<br>
It may well be doubted if Maloney knew of this trail, or if he did if he thought it worth while to make such a flank movement,
involving the division of his command without the hope of speedy junction in the case of disaster.  Leschi doubtless had fears of attack in the rear all day, and so, in the afternoon, after nearly all his men had drawn off ceased firing  except  an  occasional  shot,  and   with   seven   men held the drift in which they had fought, until it was too late in the day for his enemy to cross or if he did, to follow up with his forces.<br>
<br>
And so, as we shall see later, the first day's battle resulted in the expenditure of a good deal of ammunition, but not much blood, and caused a good deal of merriment on the part of the Indians.  At 3 o'clock, Maloney's forces turned their backs on the battle field, while the Indians were retreating on the opposite side; the first to climb the hill to their camp on the prairie near by, while the Indians continued their retreat to their camp on Green River, some three miles distant from the battle field.<br>
<br>
In the light of what has since been learned, the official reports of Captains Maloney and Hays are amusing.  No doubt they were sincere in what they wrote, but we now know, and could have then known had they stopped to think a moment, that their reports were grossly in-
correct as to the number of the Indians killed.  Captain Maloney says: "They had the advantage of the ground, but still there were over thirty killed and I don't know how many wounded"<br>
<br>
Hays reported "we estimate, their loss at thirty men.."<br>
<br>
The official reports received by the commander at Fort Steilacoom and by him transmitted to the authorities at Olympia, show to what extent men may be led while actidg under the strain of excitement, and show how easy it is for the best and bravest of men to be mistaken as to their information.<br>
<br>
No one doubts the honesty of either Captain Maloney or Hays, or for thatt matter that of the men posted on the hill who saw the Indians fall, from whom the information was gained that thirty Indians had been killed.  The following report was forwarded:<br>
<br>
Fort Steilacoom, Nov. 4th, 6 P. M., 1855-<br>
<br>
James Tilton, Adjt.  Gen.  W. T. V., Olympia.<br>
<br>
Sir: I have just received an express from Capt.  Maloney informing me that Lieut.  Slaughter, with fifty regulars and Capt.  Hays, with fifty volunteers, had met the Indians yesterday about 8 A. M. They had taken a position on the right bank of the river, and opposed the troops crossing.<br>
<br>
The river was too high to ford, and the Indians behind logs firing, so the fight became general, and lasted until about 4 P. M. Thirty Indians were killed, and no telling how many wounded, as they were
carried to the rear.  Slaughter had some men posted on & hill in the rear of his position, where they could see and count every Indian who fell.  Slaughter killed one, and Lieut.  Harrison killed two.<br>
<br>
Our loss, one soldier killed, who was falling a tree in order to cross the stream; one soldier wounded severely, and one volunteer wounded. * * *<br>
<br>
JOHN NUGEN,<br>
<br>
Lt. 4th Inf.  Com.  Post.<br>
<br>
This was the first battle of the war on the  west  side  of the mountains, and naturally all parties on both sides would be laboring under excitement.<br>
<br>
I happen to have Puyallup Tyee Dick's account of this battle, who was at the front the whole day, and he says they lost but one man.  At first, the Indians were quite nervous and inclined to fall back from the river, but as the hours passed and they remained under cover in the drift and no one was hurt, they became more confldent, and finally jubilant.<br>
<br>
He described the battle as lots and lots of fun.<br>
<br>
The Indians soon found that if any object was shown from under cover, the troops on the opposite side of the river would fire at it from various points, and so they began to push up hats and sticks until it came into sight, and bang, bang, bang, would go the guns of the enemy, down would go the hat and another Indian reported killed.  This thing went on until it became a standing joke and brought yells of delight from the Indians all along the line.<br>
<br>
A full confirmation Of this story from another source convinced me that Dick was telling the truth.  Daniel Mounts, before referred to, was with Capt.  Hays in the battle- Hays reported having six Indians killed in one particular spot and that he (Mounts) saw two of them fall himself, or at least saw their heads suddenly disappear from sight immediately after the volunteers had fired.<br>
<br>
At the same time, he believed they were killing Indians right and left but wondered how it came that so soon after an Indiam was killed, another would take his place in the identical spot.<br>
<br>
Subsequently, Mr. Mounts was appointed agent on  the Nisqually Indian Reservation and had charge of the Nisqually war party upon their return, for five years. These Indians told Mr. Mounts the same story told me by Indian Dick.  The corroboration of the story is in the fact that of the thirty-one Nisquallies that went on the war path under the leadership of Leschi, thirty came back unharmed-only
one of the whole number wounded or killed during the war.<br>
<br>
Nor is this to be wondered at when we take into consideration the<br>
splendid cover under which the Indians could fight, with their rear always fully guarded by the impenetrable forest and thickets that covered the whole country round about the district of active hostilities.<br>
<br>
The figures by no means are given to belittle the efforts of the volunteers and regulars in this war.  They show, however, what a great task lay before them, and had we had a desperate and able foe like the Modoc warriors, there would have been many more lives lost, much more treasure expended, and the time for the ending of the war greatly delayed.<br>
<br>
The material for the volunteer forces was the best the country afforded. A majority of the men were sturdy pioneers who went to the war from a sense of duty, knew no fear, nor shirked a duty.  As with all such bodies, there were sure to be some poltroons, some whose acts were reprehensible, but such were no more a reflection upon the good name of the volunteers than the same individuals were upon the community from which they were drawn.<br>
<br>
It is well for the reader to bear these remarks in mind while perusing these pages containing accounts of wrongs perpetrated upon the Indians.  It is lamentable that cruel murders were committed, but because the criminals belonged to the white race is no reason why we should screen them from view and from condemnation.<br>

TROUBLE EAST OF THE CASCADES<br>
<br>
Lucile McDonald, "Trouble east of the Cascades," <B>Washington's Yesterdays.</B>Portland: Binfords and Mort, 1953, p. 70-73.<br>
<br>
The threat of war sensed by early settlers visiting such places as  Whidby Island was the outer ripple of unrest which was to retard settlement elsewhere in the state.<br>
<br>
East of the Cascade Mountains lay the real center of trouble.  Epidemics of smallpox and measles broke  out among the Indians, brought to them by the whites.  There was no checking the sickness and the Indians, who contracted it died in incredibly short time.<br>
<br>
They regarded with hate and suspicion the immigrants who passed on this evil gift.  Fear of retaliation caused the settlers to concentrate in and near the Willamette Valley, where they felt there was safety in numbers and where  the Indians evinced no belligerent attitude.<br>
<br>
Left alone in Eastern Washington were the fur traders and the missionaries, particularly Dr. Whitman, whom the Indians were inclined to blame for their troubles.  Had he not been zealous in encouraging settlers, even to the extent of making trips east to bring them? Was he not the whites'medicine man and therefore capable of making bad as well as good medicine?<br>
<br>
Their hatred was fanned into fire.  The missionary plowing his fields was to the Indians a symbol of more white men to arrive and drive them from their homes.<br>
<br>
Nearly ten years had passed since the Whitmans had come to Waiilatpu, "the place of rye grass," and more than 70 persons were living at the mission when in November, 1847 the trouble reached a climax.  Many whites and Indians were sick at the time and Dr. Whitman made frequent trips to the lodges to treat the Cayuses.<br>
<br>
The whisper got around that the physician was not trying to cure them but to poison them.  The tale is said to have been spread by a Canadian Indian who disliked the doctor.<br>
<br>
On the morning of November 29 the mission school was open for the first time in some weeks.  Workers were scattered at the various buildings.  The tailor was at his bench, a man was laying a floor, another was sick in bed in the blacksmith shop.  The Whitmans themselves were in the dinirg room of their home with the sick mission children when an Indian appeared at the door, asking for medicine.<br>
<br>
While the doctor talked to him a war chief named Ti-lau-kait
slipped up behind and struck Dr. Whitman a tremendous blow on the head with his tomahawk.  A signal was given outside the house to other Indians.  Wild confusion reigned.  Mrs. Whitman attempted to hide the children, but was killed almost at once.  Indians swarmed in and, when the massacre was, over, fourteen persons lay dead.  Two young girls taken captive also died before they could be rescued.<br>
<br>
Several whites escaped to tell the tale to Hudson's Bay Company representatives.<br>
<br>
One emigrant family hid under the floor and later reached safety.<br>
<br>
Immediately upon hearing of the tragedy, Peter Skene Ogden, who had succeeded Dr. McLouhlin as factor at Fort Vancouver, organized an expedition to ransom the prisoners.  He arrived at Fort Walla Walla December 19 and held council with the chiefs four days later.<br>
<br>
Another six days passed before the first prisoners were brought in<br>
<br>
During that time Ogden experienced much anxiety.  Rumors were spreading among the Indians that the Americans were sending troops to punish thein.  If war broke out the captives never would be returned.<br>
<br>
Ogden managed to complete negotiations before arrival of Provisional Governor George Abernethy's volunteer army.  He paid the Cayuses 50 blankets, 50 shirts, 10 guns To the Nez Perce tribe he gave 12.blankets, two guns, 12 handkerchiefs, five fathoms of tobacco, 200 balls and powder and some knives.<br>
<br>
The prisoners were delivered to the fort in wagons.  In telling their adventures while held captive a ten-year-old girl said a Cayuse chief compelled her to knit him a pair of long-legged stockings.<br>
<br>
The rescued persons were escorted down the Columbia in bateaux.  At The Dalles they met Oregon's volunteer army en route to conduct the Cayuse War.<br>
<br>
The soldiers gathered in the missionaries from other stations to save them from the vengeance of the Indians.  This meant abandonment of Tshimakain, and the Catholic-settlement at Frenchtown on the Walla Walla River.  This latter community was formed of former Hudson's Bay employees and their Indian wives, who started faces and built a chapel.  Some of these men volunteered to fight apinst the Indians.  Their community was deserted for several years on this account.
Eastern Washingtan was once more a land only of Indians and fur-trading posts.<br>

Elwood Evans, "An in depth analysis of the Whitman Massacre."<br>
<br>
On the North bank of the Walla Walla River, facing west stood the Doctor's Adobe dwelling, furnished with a good library and a valuable cabinet of specimens.  On its north end was attached the Indian Room making an L with a long building extending 70 feet east, in which were kitchen, school room, church and sleeping rooms upstairs.  A large adobe building, one hundred yards east afforded accommodations to the many immigrants who stopped here to recruit, and always found a welcome.  Equidistant from these buildings stood the grist mill, granary, and shops.  At a distance of 18 miles up Mill Creek, stood the saw mill with a dwelling house, belonging to the station.<br>
<br>
Seventy-two persons were at the time residing and sojourning at the station.  Twenty-two lived in the Doctor's dwelling.  The constituents of that family afford a good illustration of the life and every-day character of the good Doctor and his model wife, their love for all bearing the similitude of our Pather in Heaven regardless of caste; their remembrance of the fatherless; their sympathy with the despised and lowly; their guileless, unsuspecting confidence; their consistent practice of the precepts of Him, their ever-present model, who in His earthly mission served His Father by doing good to His creatures.<br>
<br>
It consisted of Dr. and Mrs. Whitman, Mr. Rodgers, the Missionary, ten adopted children (seven of whom were the Sager orphans, whose parents had died in crossing the plains in 1844, and three half-breed girls,) two half-breed boys, whom the Doctor had raised, Joe Lewis, a half-breed,(that fiendish Iago who precipitated this horrible tragedy by villainous falsehoods, the more readily credited by the dissatisfied Indians, because of his connection with the family,) Joseph Stanfielde, a Canadian.<br>
<br>
Sojourning there were Miss Bewley and her brother, a Mr. Hoffman, late from New York, Mr. Sales, Eliza the daughter of Rev.  H.H. Spalding, then ten years of age.  Messrs.  Bewley and Sales were confined to their beds by sickness.  The remaining 50 were Americans, mostly of the overland migration of 1847, who had stopped to winter.  They were distributed through the other buildings.  
Of them 18 were adults, 8 being women, the remainder were children, mostly of tender years.  Some 10 were sick patients under the Doctor's treatment.  Joe Lewis was without doubt in the awful conspiracy.  Stanfielde had been advised beforehand, the two Marisons, youths with Nicholas Findley another half-breed employed on the farm, had been excepted from the prearranged death roll.<br>
<br>
THE MASSACRE<br>
<br>
Early in the afternoon, school having just been called, an ox had been shot and was being dressed engaged the attention of several of the men at a distance from the house.  The Indians came, as was their wont when a carcass was being cut up, but their unusual number attracted the Doctoris  attention, though he attributed the circumstances to the killing of the animal.<br>
<br>
When all the conspirators had assembled with their weapons concealed under their blankets, one of their  number went to the kitchen, called the  Doctor, complained of sickness and asked  for medicine.  The kind physician with  his usual promptness was bestowing his attention, when Tamahos stepped behind him, and with two desperate blows of a tomahawk, felled him to the earth. then followed a carnival of butchery which scarce finds its parallel in the numerous narratives of Indian perfidy and murder.  Suffice it to say that upon that afternoon there were slain in cold blood eleven defenseless, unoffending Americans.<br>
<br>
The victims were Dr. and Mrs. Whitman and the missionary Rodgers, Schoolmaster Saunders, John and Francis Sager, Messrs.  Marsh, Kimball, Gill, Young, and the two sick men Bewley and Sales.  Excepting Mrs. Whitman, the lives of the women and the children were spared.  A Mr. Hall, Mr. Osborne and family, a child of Mrs. Hayes, and two of the Doctor's children succeeded in concealing themselves during the confusion, and reached Fort Walla Walla in safety.<br>
<br>
Two families (Messrs.  Smith and Young) were at the saw mill up Mill Creek, from whence they were brought to the station next day. of these there were four men, Mr. Smith, Mr. Young and two grown-up sons.  By the interposition of two Nez Perce chiefs, the lives of these men were spared, and they swelled the number of captives to 51.<br>
<br>
On the 23rd of December, Gov.  Peter Skeen Ogden, a chief factor of the Hudson's Bay Co., with a large number of blankets, shirts, guns, tobacco, etc. generously advanced by that Company, ransomed the survivors from that captivity more odious than death itself.<br>
<br>
At this late period, the mere words of recital of those direful deeds, curdles the blood.  Involuntarily your thoughts find utterance in the language of Nature's own inanortal bard:<br>

"murder most foul,<br>
<br>
as in the best it is, But this most foul, strange and unnatural."<br>
<br>
THE CAUSES, DIRECT AND REMOTE<br>
<br>
The colorable pretext attempted in palliation of this enormity, only invests it with the deeper interest, the greater novelty.  Briefly it was this: Several families of the overland migration of 1847 reached the station, members of whom were sick with measles and dysentery.  Stopping for the winter, as a consequence, the former disease broke out with considerable fatality among the Indians.<br>
<br>
Those who adopted the Indian remedy of the sweating oven, followed by the plunging into the river, invariably died. of the number who applied to Dr. Whitman, several cases proved fatal.<br>
<br>
By Indian custom, as you all know, the medicine man forfeits his life to the kindred of the patient, if death ensues.  Although it has never been claimed that the Indians exacted this penalty as to Dr. Whitman, still their apologists assert that by their super-
stitious tenets he was regarded by them as instrumental in compassing the deaths which occurred.<br>
<br>
Again, the Doctor, annoyed by wolves preying upon his stock, had set out poisoned bait for their destruction, which the Indians finding had eaten with fatal results.  His watermelon patch had been robbed.  To detect and deter the tresspassers he had inserted emetics, which had sickened the thieves.  Thus they learned and pretended to believe that the Doctor could sicken or kill by aid of his "bad medicines."<br>
<br>
This being their alleged state of mind.  It was an easy task for Joe Lewis to inflame them by his stories that he had overheard the plottings together of Dr. Whitman, his amiable Christian wife and the Rev.  H.H. Spalding, in which they had resolved to get rid of the Indians by poison, and thereby secure their lands and their horses.<br>
<br>
Had Dr. Whitman alone been killed, his murderer laboring under a delusion or superstition that he was a "bad medicine man," a poisoner of Indians, such might be accepted as the motive for the act.  Had the Indian idea that when the Doctor lost a patient he had forfeited a life, been alleged as the motive, possibly the death of Mrs. Whitman becomes explained.  In such gratification of Indian hate and revenge, those who could see in it the obedience to
reliqious sentiment instead of total depravity, would extenuate such double murder in this wise.<br>
<br>
"That Dr. Whitman and his innocnt wife have fallen a sacrifice to Indian superstition maddened into an uncontrollable impulse by the plausible machinations of a half-breed monster."<br>
<br>
But the Indians on that day made no such discrimination.  They slaughtered those who were unsuspected of any meditated wrong, sick men, and those who had but recently come to the station, just from the East, who were intending in the spring to go on to the Willamette.  Instead of confining their murderous acts to those who had thus been accused of meditating or practicing their wrong, all the havoc and concomitants of savage warfare were let loose upon a certain class, a nationality, against which war was thereafter to be waged.  In accordance with the customs of Indian warfare, the women and children had been captured alive.<br>
<br>
The fuel had been accumulating for years.  The pile of inflammable material embraced jealousy of a superior race; opposition to the occupancy (i.e., the permanent settlement in the country of Americans); a bias in favor of the Hudson's Bay Co. employee, or King George; the natural result of a quarter century's intercourse with the posts and their able managing men; and in, corresponding degree a suspicion against the American or "Boston;" the presence of diverse, not to say hostile, religious systems; the superior adaptability of the mode adopted by the Catholic Fathers, and correspondingly detracting from the influence of the Protestant missionaries, which had to a great extent alienated them; Doctor Whitman's avowed policy and his direct agency in encouraging American settlement in the country.<br>
<br>
His profession as a doctor of medicine rendered him measurably an object of awe to the Indian, and by their ritual made him amenable for the life of patients actually attended, while others more superstitious and ignorant believed or pretended to believe that he was insturmental in causing a contagious disorder to be spread among them.  This mass of combustibles was readily fired by a ruthless incendiary, a plausible, well educated villain who acquired prestige with the Indian because he was a member of the Doctor's household.<br>
<br>
All these influences operated to create that "animus" towards Americans, the motive for breaking up the mission and to expel the Americans from the country.  The truth is, the massacre was an outburst of "national" hostility and hate against Americans. waiilatpu and its peaceful unarmed inmates had been doomed because it was an American missionary station, because it was the home of Americans.  The Whitman Massacre was an Indian raid by the hostile
Cayuses against the American inmates of that station.<br>
<br>
Nor have I arrived at this conclusion without due charity, a due allowance for the infirmities of human nature, and especially the peculiarities of the Indian race.  I appreciate the fact that excesses in bloodshed may unintentionally result from that madness engendered in the carnival of murder, when the worst passions are<br>
unrestrained, when thirst for blood but grows apace with the frenzy that can only be allayed by additional victims.<br>
<br>
Concede there was neither time, nor opportunity for discrimination, none for the exercise of fixedness of purpose, but in that dayliqht raid upon Waiilatpu, there was "method in the madness." The selection of the victims illustrates the motive for their immol-
ation, gives evidence of the preconcerted plot attended with deliberate and well defined purpose in its execution.  Every act of the hostiles indicates design deep-laid, predetermined.  It was no hasty revenge responsive to the indignation prompted by a personal injury, or the fear of a meditated wrong.  Its consumation as a whole, its every surrounding proclaims its philosophy, its purpose, the lesson taught.<br>
<br>
1.     How significant that the three missionaries, including Mrs. Whitman, and the teachers were killed.  Why should the pious Mrs. Whitman, always a wonderful favorite with the Indians, be the only female killed, when their avowed program had been to capture alive the women and children? The reason is apparent. the Cayuses had not only determined to break up that mission, but in that inhuman act they meant to make it known that no other missionary labors by Americans would be allowed in their country.<br>
<br>
To them it had become demonstrated that if there were American missionary stations, Americans would travel back and forth through the country, that such station was likly to become the nucleus of settlement, and the Americans would begin to fill the country.  This impious, cowardly massacre, therefore, indicated t@at the Cayuse nation had determined to abruptly end American occupancy and discourage American settlement of the country.<br>
<br>
2.     Tell me, why American men, not merely whites were killed? Why Joe Lewis, Stanfielde, the half breeds, all employees of the Doctor, were unmolested and were suffered to remain at waiilatpu during the massacre and for days afterward? One answer only can be<br>
made: They were not of'the proscribed race.  Their irmnunity from danger proves the act to have been enmity against Americans, not the mere outburst of passion to revenge supposed injuries or to avert apprehended or threatened wrongs.<br>
<br>

3.      The saving alive of the women and children to be used as hostages to enable the Cayuses to avoid the consequences of their atrocious crime gives unmistakable evidence of the plot.  The councils held in December, 1847, by Bishop Blanchet and Gov.  Ogden with the Cayuses demonstrate that the Indians anticipated that the Catholic clergy and the officers of the Hudson's Bay Co. would sympathize with them and shield them from punishment by the Americans.<br>
<br>
But while those parties could with safety remain in the country, (showing that Indians felt no hostility to either class, that it was not a hostility to whites, but enmity restricted to Americans,) yet both severely denounced the outrage at their councils.  To Gov.  Ogden's promptness and philanthropy, eternal gratitude is due for the speedy rescue of the waiilatpu captives.<br>
<br>
If proof were needed outside or beyond the act itself with its mode of commission, it will be furnished by the Indian manifesto of Dec 20, 1847, enclosed by Bishop Blanchet to the Governor of Oregon.  In it is paraded the fact that Joe Lewis made the accusations already detailed.  Forgetting, however, such pretended grievences against particular individuals their propositions for amnesty develop the '$motive behind," the cause, of which the American inmates of the Whitman station were as innocent as are yourselves.<br>
<br>
The fate of the captives, women and children, is made to hinge upon the acceptance of the following propositions;<br>
<br>
l.That the Americans may not go to war with the Cayuses.<br>
<br>
2. That they (the Americans) may forget the lately committed murders, as the Cayuses will forget the murder of the son of the great chief of the Walla Wallas, comitted in California. (It may be well to remark that this refers to the killing of Elijah, in 1844, by Californians.<br>
<br>
In the  spring  of  1847,  a band of Cayuses and Walla Wallas went to California to avenge his death, but finding the Americans too strong to proceed to extremities, they returned without striking a blow, thus leaving, according to the Indian view, the matter unsettled.  As they returned early in the fall, several of the party died from sickness; such unfortunate termination of their expedition added fuel to the flame, and only intensified their hostility to Americans.)<br>
<br>
3 That two or three great men may come up and conclude peace.<br>
<br>
4. That as soon as these great men have arrived and concluded peace, they may take with them all the women and children.<br>
<br>
5.      They give assurance that they will not harm the captives
before the arrival of these two or three great men.<br>
<br>
6. They ask that Americans may not travel any more through their country, as their young men might do them harm."<br>
<br>
This document was signed by Teloquoit, who led the murderous gang at Waiilatpu, Camaspelo, To-wa-to- and Ache Kara (five crows) the wretch who appropriated miss Bewley as his share of their triumph.<br>
<br>
Do not these propositions unmistakably avow, as we are now even for the murder of Elijah, that if you Americans will overlook the massacre at Waiilatpu, and hereafter come not through our country, we will surrender unharmed the women and children captives.<br>
<br>
Their attempt at self-justification was briefly summed up by Bishop Blanchet in his accompanying letter.  Speaking in their behalf he says they claim "that the tragedy of the 29tb had occurred from an anxious desire of self preservation, and that it was the reports made against the Doctor and others which led them to commit the act."<br>
<br>
In that council of the 20th of December, as also the one convened by Gov.  Ogden, Dec. 23, no charge by any Indian is made, or that Dr. Whitman ever wronged an Indian, or that any missionary ever did any of that race a wrong.  The burden of justification rests upon "reports." we might inquire, who made these reports? What were they and with what motive? Who educated this prejudice? Who sowed this storm? We would most probably learn that there was no intent nor idea to incite personal hostility, but really to destroy Dr. Whitman's influence with the Indians, to defeat the teachings of the missionaries, and cause them to abandon that field of labor, discouraged and desparing of success.<br>
<br>
ITS RESULTS<br>
<br>
This gloomy retrospect suggests numerous thoughts, The immediate sequel of the massacre was a bitter controversy between the Protestant and Roman Catholic settlers of Oregon.  Many claimed to believe that the Cayuses had been incited thereto by the agency of servants of the Hudson's Bay Co. That company almost exclusively occupied the interior, in which the mission of the American Board had its several stations, and by its matchless Indian policy inflexibly pursued for the quarter century previous, had acquired perfect control of the Indians.<br>
<br>
The press of that period teems with the evidence that the horror of waiilatpu was accredited by many as the direct result of anti-American combined with anti-Protestant influences, that it was
believed that white men were actually responsible for instigating the act.  Time, which makes all things even, alike mollifying sectarian rancor and national prejudice, has mitigated such suspicions, and I have referred to their existence not to endorse or justify such criminations, but to chronicle one of,@he most unhappy consequences of that terrible crime, which long survived its commission.<br>
<br>
Is it not plain that the subsequent introduction of a system of re-
ligion in direct conflict with that previously taught, among such a race, and particularly to members or families of the same tribe, regardless of the fact that two white races with adverse interests were presently striving for mastery of the country and control of its native population, must of necessity arouse prejudices liable to be most dangerous in their consequences? But except for the aggressive efforts of the Catholic Clergy to establish their faith, to wean Protestant-professing Indians from their- teachings, to establish missions in a field already occupied, and to neutralize the labors of the Protestant missionaries, there is no evidence of avowed intention by the priests to secure exclusion by the Indians of the Protestant missions from that region, or of inciting the Indians to acts of hostility against the Protestant missionaries.<br>
<br>
While the Catholic clergy could and did remain in the hostile country, there is no evidence that any of that clergy counselled those barbarities, approved the deed, or attempted to shield the murderers.  It is true that they had been apprised of the hostility of the Indians to the presence of the Whitman mission, and they had warned Dr. Whitman of such feelings: but there is no evidence that they knew that a plot was on foot to massacre the inmates of Waiilatpu.<br>
<br>
Their accountability rests alone upon the introduction into Dr. Whitman's missionary field of what proved to be an element of discord. whether designedly or not, the mind of the Indian had become unsettled.  At the first opportunity the consequences were disastrous.  Suppose a child of tender years asked me to give it a sharpened razor.  Meaning it a kindness I yield to its importunities, and it fatally injures itself or another.  Can I justify myself for that culpable carelessness, for assuming the risk that the child would do no harm.  Sectarian warfare has cost oceans of blood.<br>
<br>
It may be likened to an edged tool which entrusted to the simple minded Indian is like the razor in the hands of the infant.  Who so acts or teaches is not innocent of the consequences.  This homely illustration shows how far those parties who engendered Indian prejudice against the Protestant missionary or the American, for their religion or their race must be held accountable for the condition of Indian,mind which rendered possible the commission of that horrible tragedy. To that extent, and that only history will
impute liability.<br>
<br>
The massacre of necessity resulted in the Cayuse war, successfully waged by the Oregon Provisional Goverranent to punish the Indian murders of those innocents whose lives had been sacrificed because they were of our race.  To the American settlers of Oregon exclusively was committed the sacred duty of carrying on that war.<br>
<br>
The Hudson's Bay Company through its offices generously and promptly ransomed the captives.  In the council with the Indians Dec. 23, 1847, Gov.  Ogden addressed them saying among other things, "Remember you alone will be responsible for the consequen-
ces.  It is merely advice I give you.  I hold forth no promise should war be declared against you.  We have nothing to do with it.  I have not come here to make you promises or hold out assistance.  We have nothing to do with your quarrels, we remain neutral."<br>
<br>
The Bishop of Walla Walla in forwarding the Indian manifesto of Dec. 20, 1847, says in his accompanying letter to Oregon's patriotic Governor, the good George Abernethy:<br>
<br>
"Your excellency has to judge of the document which I have been requested to forward to you.  Nevertheless, without having the least intention of influence one way or the other, I feel myself obliged to tell you that by going to war with the Cayuses you un-
doubtedly will have all the Indians of the country against you. would it be to the interest of a young colony to expose herself? But that you will have to decide with your council.<br>
<br>
It is with painful regret that I refer to this letter.  It proves too much.  It disclaims sympathy and declines co-operation with that patriotic government in its only duty.  Nay its spirit and tone ask for amnesty to the murderers of our people, the ravishers of our women and children.  The din of preparation in the-Willamette settlements to avenge this most diabolical massacre has been anticipated at the Umatilla.  Ere long it will reach the hostile camp.<br>
<br>
Ere long there will come the demand by an outraged people upon the Cayuse nation for those murderers.  That holy and devout man is peaceably and safely dwelling in their midst, actuated by a zeal to increase his flock.  About him, mingling with his people are those very savages whose hands are red with the innocent blood of Waiilatpu.  He can have had no doubt that these murderers would be demanded, and if not surrendered that a just retribution would be visited upon their people, their abettors.<br>
<br>
In all charity, in the light of all the evidence, I heartily acquit
him of all complicity before the fact in the horror of waiilatpu.  But, on the 20th of December a council is held participated in by the murderers, whose requests for amnesty he champions, in fact becomes their voluntary sponsor.  Nay, more! he uses the above language assuming an indifference as to what course the Oregon government will adopt.<br>
<br>
Was it neutrality he meant by the phrase, "without having the least intention to influence one way or the other," or did he not mean as the whole paragraph unmistakably implies? "If you declare war against the Cayuse nation, you are responsible for the consequen-
ces.  I wash my hands of it."<br>
<br>
The Provisional Government despite the neutrality of the Hudson's Bay Co. regardless of the warning of the Bishop of Walla Walla sent its little army into the enemy's country, whipped the hostiles in two pitched battles.  The murderers were not-secured during that rpemorable struggle, but in 1850, the five surviving ring-leaders were surrendered to Gen.  Joseph Lane, first Governor and Superintendent of Indian Affairs of Oregon after its organization as a Territorial government.  They were tried at Oregon City and executed.<br>
<br>
One more result of that day of death and disaster, the only joyful thought these reminiscences suggest.  Can it be that any good can come out of such unmitigated evil? In the good providence of Almighty God, there is no stronger incentive to weary not in well doing, to halt not in labor for the amelioration of humanity, for the triumph of the right, than the soul comforting assurance that "the blood of the martyrs is the seed of the Church." This is but a terse expression that only means "whereby good may come out of evil."<br>
<br>
The great O'Connell taught the principle in his injunction to do right, for "every wrong act bui gives strength to the enemy." The early if not the only beneficent consequence following the great crime was the creation of Oregon into a Territory of the United States, the sending hither of U.S. troops to afford protection to a people hitherto entirely ignored, who had established free institutions on the shores of the Pacific.  The blood of Americans shed at Waiilatpu was the eloquent protest against a neglect which had rendered possible such a loss of valuable lives, patriotic men and women who had loved and served their country.<br>
<br>
It was the solemn reminder to the American people that the Government owed its protection to their kindred on the extreme western frontier, American men, women and childrn who had labored to save that country to the nation, which its apathy and indifference had well nigh forever lost.  That massacre of defenceless Americans awoke the Goverranent to its duty.  Remember
then I adjure you that dread day in 1847., It was the precursor of the United States extending its laws and jurisdiction over Oregon, of assuming its parental duty to its loving children, the American pioneers of Oregon.<br>
<br>
The arrival of troops shortly followed, with that came the morale of Oregon being part of the United States, The nature of things was changed.  The seed which had before been planted now protected, their growth stimulated, in one short generation have expanded into the glorious present.  Her settlements were to become American commonwealths was the harbinger of the fathers who had so anxiously waited.  Oregon was a part of the United States of America.  The horror at Waiilatpu was to be the last of the evidences that there was conflict within her borders, to prevent Oregon from being colonized by the citizens of ihat nation who was its rightful owner.<br>
<br>
THE LIFE-WORK AND SERVICES OF THE MARTYRS WHITMAN<br>
<br>
Kind friends, bear with me yet a little, while I invite you to the rude mound which marks the last restingplace, the spot where fell these victims of Indian perfidy, ingratitude, superstition and hate, because they were Americans.  Daily that eloquent reminder of delay to do our duty is passed by strangers who now enjoy the means of safe, speedy transportation back and forth through that region where thirty one,years ago, an American could not live.<br>
<br>
The name Whitman has been perpetuated, for the Waiilatpu has become the Whitman station of the railroad connecting Wallula with that city of the plains, the flourishing Walla Walla.  Not far distant the county bearing his name, whose growth in its few years of American settlement vindicates the unerring judgment that prompted the sagacious Whitman as early as 1840, to predict and labor that that region should be filled up with Americans.<br>
<br>
His faith cost him his life, but the future, our present has proven that his hope would leave been gloriously fulfilled long, long ago, but for that heartsickening catastrophe whose lessons we are considering.<br>
<br>
Let us for a brief moment devote our thought to the MAN whose name is inseparably and immortally associated with the anniversary, in such a way as to sanctify it in the hearts of every lover of Christianity, every lover of his country, every ].over of his race.  Is not the thought humiliating that after thirty one years have completed their course since that sacrifice was made, which has brought forth such fruits; all that serves to perpetuate the record of those labors for country, religion, and humanity, those heroic virtues, that sublime courage, that disinterested devotion, that
immolation has been the simple prefix of the martyrs name to history.<br>
<br>
The Great Pioneer of Oregon's Americanization lives in our remembrance because he was chief among those who fell in an Irdian massacre. we who have reaped the fruits which that martyerdom helped so niuct, to assure, have neglected the ashes of which we are honored in being the guardians.<br>
<br>
Let us most briefly then refer to scme of the incidents in the spotless, severe but useful lives of Marcus and Narciss Prentiss Whitman.  Their mutual embarking in the Oregon mission is in itself full of significance of the great idea of t@ieir lives, obedience to duty.  How strikingly it exhibits love to God, love to His creatures, devoted love each to the other.  The two were plighted to each other.  The Doctor had resolved to go upon this mission.  She consented and was ready to share his labors, help bear the burdens, to give encouragement.<br>
<br>
The Rdv.  H.H. Spalding and wife had already set out on the Osage mission.  Dr. Whitman laid his plans before Mr. Spalding, suggesting a change of his missionary field.  The latter submitted the matter to that sainted heroine, Mrs. Henry Spalding.  She readily assented, willingly agreed to undertake the far greater labor, the more perilous enterprise.  The Doctor married, and in 1836 their wedding tour was across the continent, the wedding party consisting of the two heroic wives, and their husbands, Dr. Whitman and Rev.  Henry H. Spalding, and William  H. Gray.<br>
<br>
Their escort consisted of the rough mountain men in the service of the American Fur Co. These generous fellows protested against the women taking that journey, they even suggested stopping them by the civil authorities.  But the women undaunted, persisted in their resolution and crossed the continent on horseback.  That journey projected and successfully performed was the wearly dawn of Oregon Americanization." I have on previous occasions spoken of the heroic act, and its inestimable value in the solution of the Oregon Controversy, (it helped to demonstrate the accessibility of Oregon to the United States) that it could be peopled overland from the Western States.<br>
<br>
That had been the great doubt then causing the minds of American publicists to hesitate.  They were unwilling to incur the risk of war with Great Britain, for a region supposed to be inaccessible, therefore valueless.  Ten years ago, I had the honor to address a Seattle audience in which I alluded to that pioneer trip, which set the example for American immigration to Oregon.  Without substantial change, I then said:<br>
<br>

"Two heroic self-sacrificing American woman found the solution of this problem of doubt and uncertainty.  Actuated by as holy an impulse as inspired the Puritan Pathers to spread the blessings of the Christian religion in new lands, they undertook the pilgrimage to Oregon to convert the Indians.  What sermon could be more eloquent than that silent readiness to undertake such a journey? Wo heroism more sublime than their willingness to go.  How sanctified has been that preaching!<br>
<br>
"How shortly after the fruit appeared, in opening to Americanization the vast region west cf the Rocky Mountains, preparing it for the homes of men, women and children.  If women could reach Oregon overland, the settlement of territorial claim was attained.  That interesting incident of the past was the sure harbinger of what we have now realized.  The great engineering and utilitarian idea of the 19th century, has been consumated.  The continent is crossed by a railroad.<br>
<br>
"After American women had traversed the broad plains and crossed the great mountain chains of the American continent, it was needless further to search for a ustrait of Anian." That journey accomplished safely, preceded the emigrant wagon road.  As a natural consequence, the railway has been substituted, the commerce of the Pacific and Eastern seas is concentrated in American cities on the Pacific shores, and the United States of America is the leading power of the world."<br>
<br>
THE WINTER JOURNEY OF 1842-43<br>
<br>
The journey of Dr. Whitman in the winter of 1842-43, from Waiilatpu to Boston is notable for the hardships encountered, and its valuable results to Oregon, and the nation.  In late years it has attracted considerable attention by the discussion of effect in the Oregon Controversy, as to the agency exerted by the Oregon Protestant missions in saving a portion of Oregon Territory to the United States.<br>
<br>
The motives of Dr. Whitman and his colaborers in originating this journey and the political or international labors performed or consequences resulting have been largely commented upon.  Weighty and respectable names are authority -for the statement, or for a color of statement which converts that missionary trip to the American Board into a political mission to the American Government.<br>
<br>
It is asserted and believed:<br>
<br>
1st, that Dr. Whitman left Waiilatpu for Washington City to ac-
quaint President Tyler with certain facts as to the value of Oregon, and certain acts which had transpired or, were about to be enacted, showing British intent to occupy and strengthen British title; to thwart the effect of Sir Geo.  Simpson's visit who hoped
to secure Oreaon north of the Columbia River in exchange for a cod fishery.<br>
<br>
2nd, That he actually arrived just in time to defeat such a barter.<br>
<br>
3rd, That as a means to strengthen American title by occupancy, his purpose was to organize a migration from the Western States, and the immigration of 1843 was the consequence of his trip, and his labors.<br>
<br>
4th, That he told the President, he could and would conduct that train safely through to the Columbia River, and secured the pledge that the offer as to boundary should be delayed, and as a consequence, what is now Washington Territory, was not at that time relinquished by the United States.<br>
<br>
Statements of precedent acts with some circumstances that render the performance possible, gives plausibility to the narrative when not inconsistent with historic results.  Oft-times they are accepted without question especially when emanating from parties of character who are supposed to have means of knowledge.  They pass unchallenged, become traditional, and are engrafted upon the current history of the times.  Thus error may become perpetuated, injustice done, history perverted.<br>
<br>
Trite and true is the aphorism, "that a story is good till the other side is told." From contemporaries of Dr. Whitman, men who had access to him and to his records, the data were derived upon which those statements were published.  In my admiration for the man, my sympathy for his tragic fate, "the wish was father to the thought," and I have given utterance to language which measurably and by far too approvingly, endorse those representations Challenged to the proof, upon investigation I was forced to concede the narrative inaccurately stated the claim, over-stated, that a false or undue color had been ascribed to a eries of acts, upon which the claims were based; that injustice was actually done to others; that the claims were also invidious, and therefore necessarily hurtful to Dr. Whitman's well earned fame.<br>
<br>
But what satisfied me most, I found a record of uncontradicted acts and facts with the results naturally flowing therefrom, vindicating the patriotism, judgment and foresight of Dr. Whitman; that the "animus" of those acts as declared by himself which shaped his career and governed his conduct, entitled him to  the  gratitude of his fellow countrymen.<br>
<br>
That true record which cannot be gainsayed exhibits him as the most far-seeing man of that time,     while his life of usefulness and service to his fellow man stamp him as the forecost man in those pioneer days. why then seek for a motive for such journey other than he furnished? The effort to dissuade the American Board from
abandoning their foothold in the country, the effort to enlist that board in his grand scheme of making the mission contribute to the American occupancy of Oregon.<br>
<br>
Why disparage the value of that practical knowledge he gave that spring at Washington, by exciting a necessity for false coloring? was it not enough when be gave the truthful assurance? "Our missionary women on horseback in 1836 crossed the continent.  In 1840 a wagon was taken through to the Columbia River.  Last year an immigration came through from the Western States.  I have just crossed the mountains in midwinter.  The Rocky Mountains need not be dreaded.  The plains can be safely crossed. wagon.s and stock can go to the Columbia River.  There is a practicable wagon road across the continent.<br>
<br>
Oregon is accessible; it can be peopled overland from the United States.  It is a good country, abounding in natural resources and mineral wealth.  The British are strengthening their title by occupancy by planting agricultural colonies.  It must be filled by Americans or foreigners." There he plead for the American Oregon in the earnestness of truth, a living illustration of what he said, his noble character carrying conviction.  Is there any wonder the administration were thereafter committed to the cause of the American Oregon; that President Tyler, in his next annual message (Dec. 5, 1843) urged a speedy settlement of the Oregon que'stion, the protection of the American settlers and of the emmigrant route?<br>
<br>
That Dr. Whitman expected to secure and earnestly invoked the co-
operation of the Board in the formation of Christian colonies to return with him to Oregon, is demonstrated by official data of the American Board.  That was the immigration he had in view, when setting out upon that journey.<br>
<br>
Disappointed  in  that  hope, in June, 1843, he left Boston, hastened on to the overland train, overtook it on Platte River and became the physician and conductor of that immense caravan, the emigrant column of 1843.  Detracting nothing from the high estimate accorded to Dr. Whitman's services, I controvert the intregity and consistency of factstatement referred to for the following reasons:<br>
<br>
1st.  They are not supported by, nor consistent with, the record of that visit and its objects as presented at the time in the official bulletin of the American Board of Foreign Missions; the statements in the Missionary Herald being corroborated by Reverends Eels and Spalding in their accounts of the special meeting of the mission at Waiilatpu in October, 1843.  The intention of that trip is fully declared.<br>

It strips the journey of political intent.  It warrants an assertion that the Doctor intended to bring out immigrants, but as such act was contingent of the approval of the American Board, it increased the improbability of Dr. Whitman taking any steps to invite immigrants until after he had reached Boston, which was March 30, 1843.<br>
<br>
2nd.  When that journey was determined, political or international results did not enter into consideration, except as a matter of strengthening the mission.  The life of the mission was at stake.  The Doctor believed with Christian families settled near the stations their success of the missions would be guaranteed, their influence strengthened.  The visit to Washington was an incident, while the benefits were of the utmost value, they were the conse-
quences of an act, not thought of and exercising no influence in projecting the journey.<br>
<br>
The whole service performed by Dr. Whitman at Washington was the enlightenment of the Administration by a living witness, who, in his proper person, could illustrate what Oregon was, where it was, how it could be reached., and of what importance it was to the nation.  That he faithfully performed the service, the quickly following sequel demonstrates.  President Tyler in his next annual message, Dec 5, 1843, vindicates the nation's claim to the whole of Oregon, asserts that the time had arrived for the settlement of the question.<br>
Having stated that the Oregon negotiations had been transferred to London, where they were about to be resumed, he says: "many of our citizens are either already established in the territory or are on their way thither for the purpose of forming permanent settlements, while others are preparing to follow; and, in view of these facts, I must repeat the recommendation for the establishment of military posts at such places on the line of travel as will furnish security and protection to our hardy adventurers against hostile tribes of Indians inhabiting those extensive regions. our laws should also follow them, so modified as the circumstances of the case may seem to require."<br>
<br>
The President's message must be as conclusive as to two facts: 1. His administration prior to Dec. 5, 1843, had never entertained any proposition which involved the surrender of any part of the Oregon Territory. 2. That occupancy by American permanant settlers was becoming appreciated as an important factor in the early and fav-
orable settlement of the Oregon question, to promote which, by encouraging settlement, the law's protection should follow, and the route should be made safe to migrate thither.<br>
<br>
The allegation that Daniel Webster as Sectretary of State was about to yield Oregon north of the Columbia River in consideration for a cod fishery on the Northeast coast is unwarranted by the facts.  A moment's reflection will satisfy anyone that such a position of
things could not have been known to Dr. Whitman, could not have been represented to him.  Nor could he have effected anything by a personal interview with the President or Secretary of State. such a proposition made by either negotiator would be the subject of a letter.<br>
<br>
Until diplomatic correspondence has been communicated to Congress, it is strictly confidential.  All the correspondence on the Oregon question has been made public.  All Mr. Webster's negotations with the British ministers during President Tyler's administration are matters of history.  The negotation which led to the Ashburton Treaty, Aug. 9, 1842, excluded the matter of Oregon boundary, and settled all other matters then in controversy between the United SStates and Great Britain.<br>
<br>
In November, 1842, by the application of the British minister, the Oregon question was formally transferred to London, to be there discussed between the American minister and the British Secretary for Foreign Affairs.  Mr. Webster resigned in May, and Dec. 5, when President Tyler delivered his message, negotiations were then about to be resumed.<br>
<br>
The truth is that from the commencement of the Webster-Ashburton negotiations in June, 1842, until renewed by Sir R. Pakenham, July 22, 1844, the Oregon question was not a matter of negotiation at Washington.  It it; also significant that President Tyler's administration had been most severely criticized for concluding the Ashburton Treaty including the final settlement of the Oregon boundary.<br>
<br>
Truth compels the statement, that the only offer of settlement during Mr. Tyler's administration, was made in 1844 while John C. Calhoun was Sectretary of State, and it was rejected without submitting it to the President.<br>
<br>
But fortunately Daniel Webster in his own characteristic language has divested this question of doubt.  He has made up his own record unmistakably upon the proposition to adopt Columbia River as the North boundary of Oregon.  In the Senate of the United States, March 30, 1846, he had remarked that if the offer made by the United States in 1826 (49 degrees north latitude to the ocean with free navigation of the Columbia River, and straits adjacent,) were now tendered by Great Britain, as a general basis of settlement, it would prove acceptable to both countries.<br>
<br>
Senator William  Allen, of Ohio, replying, charged Mr. Webster with having in effect offered the said river as the boundary.  To which Mr. Webster replied: "The Government of the United States never offered any line south of 49 degrees,(with the navigation of the Columbia) and it never will.  It behooves all concerned to regard this a settled point.  As to the navigation of the Columbia permanently or for a term of years, that is all matter for just, reasonable and friendly negotation.  But the 49th parallel must be
regarded as the general line of boundary and not to be departed from for Any line further south."<br>
<br>
Mr. Allen then charged Mr. Webster with attempting to prepare the public mind for settling down on the Columbia River as a boundary.  Mr. Webster reiterated what he had said about the renewal by Great Britain of the American offer of 1826, proving acceptable as the general basis of settlement, when Senator Allen interrupted with the remark : "Such proposition will be considered as amounting to this: that we are willing to give up the navigation of the Columbia River."<br>
<br>
To which Webster rejoined: "I did not recommend that we should decide either one way or the other as to the use of the Columbia River.  Not at all.  What I meant and what I said was, that if 49 degrees should be agreed on as a general basis, I was satisfied to negotiate about all the rest.  But the gentleman from Ohio and the Senate will do me the justice to allow that I said, as plainly as I could speak oi put down in words in writing, that England must not expect anything short of forty-nine degrees.  I said so in so riany words."<br>
<br>
Marcus Whitman's fame rests upon a solid foundation.  It needs not imputing to him motives he never dreamed of, nor ascribing a color or intent to his acts which he would never have claimed at their incentive, much less in the disparaqing of the acts of others.  The lofty patriotism of Daniel Webster needs no vindication in an American audience.  The allegations upon which I have commented have done that exalted statesman an injustice, implied by the fear that the integrity of the Oregon Territory was in jeopardy while he was Secretary of State.  History proves such fear was groundless, but leaves the real service of Marcus Whitman as great, as appreciable, as though the fear had been justified.<br>
<br>
In Oregon's day of darkness and doubt, he championed her cause, he believed his nation rightfully owned the territory, he used all his influence to aid her in successfully maintaining that right.  He never made such claim himself as has been made in his behalf.  Jesse Applegate, who traveled for weeks with Dr. Whitman in the summer of 1843, as he returned to his station, says: "We spent much of our time together after he joined our party, and talked fre-
quently of his journey to the States, but I never understood from him that he had in it a political purpose."<br>
<br>
Gen.  A.L.Lovejoy, who accompanied Dr. Whitman across the Rocky Mountains in that winter trip of 1842, joined him again at Fort Laramie on his return in 1843 and then traveled with hint to waillatpu, has recently published a graphic account of that terrible winter in the Rocky mountains, while eulogizing the Doctor's greatness of character and the valuable results consequent
upon that journey, he is silent as to anything having been said by Dr. Whitman attaching political intent or purposes thereto, nor does he allege that the Doctor claimed any agency whatever in encouraging or organizing the immigration of the year 1843.<br>
<br>
To conduct through to the Columbia River (with wagons) the immigration of 1843, which it has been claimed was attributable to his  direct agency, has been assigned as a leading purpose for Dr. Whitman's journey East in the winter of 1842-43.  To this proposition I must dissent:<br>
<br>
First - Such claim is contradicted by the fact that the Doctor's mission was to secure a Protestant immigration to settle in the upper country, where were the stations of the American Board, not to settle in the Willamette Valley, protestant families were to hold the country against foreigners.  He hoped, by the influence and co-operation of the Board, to return that season with laborers for that field, which had invited his best energies.<br>
<br>
Second - It was simply an impossible for Doctor Whitman after the time (Oct. 23, 1842) he had started from Waiilatpu, to have even made it known that he offered his services to guide immigrants through next season (1843) to Oregon, much less to prevail. on any one by personal appeal or by mail, because:<br>
<br>
1. He went by Taos and Santa Fe, met with several delays in the mountains, and did not reach Boston till March 30, 1843.  Compelled by such delays to make all haste he could not visit western comm I unities and work up a party had such been his purpose.<br>
<br>
2.Those who constituted the party of 1843 had made up their minds, and to a great extent their preparations, by or before the time that Dr. Whitman was setting out from waiilatpu.<br>
<br>
3. Dr. Whitman's loyalty to the Board and the Mission who deputed him, would not have suffered him to turn aside till he had reported to the Prudental committee.<br>
<br>
4. He would have taken no steps in such a project until after consultation with that Committee.<br>
<br>
5. he did not leave Boston on his return till June 1, conclusively showing that he had no engagements whatever with that immigration.<br>
<br>
6.Intelligent and best informed members of that migration knew not of his having visited the East that spring, their first knowledge of such fact being his overtaking them on Platte River.<br>
<br>
7. Dr. Whitman's letters to the American Board in the fall of 1843, stating his acts with that train, repel all idea of his having organized it , or being its leader.<br>
<br>

Stripping these claims of their false coloring and securing the "bottom facts," truthfully heralding the services of this great patriot and philanthropist, exalt rather than derogate from his claim to the regard of posterity.  Truth, naked, unvarnished truth, which can neither be denied nor questioned, names him as the foremost American in early Oregon.<br>
<br>
The value of the service he so ably and disinterestedly performed, is attested by one of the most prominent and ablest of his contemporaries.  Jesse Applegate, chief among that large @y of men, women and children who crossed the continent in 1843, heralds the then existing opinion as.to the supposed obstacles to an emigrant wagon road to the Columbia River.<br>
<br>
It was the opinion before that year thats "Down the Snake River no large number of cattle could subsist on its scanty pasturage nor could wagons be taken over a route so rugged and mountainous." He terms the migration of 1843 "strictly an experiment not only in respect to the numbers, but to the outfit of the migrating party which consisted of over one thousand souls with about 120 wagons drawn by 6 ox teams averaging about 6 yokes to the team and several thousand loose horses and cattle."<br>
<br>
The "old man eloquent," thus depicts the overland journey: "The way lies over trackless wastes, wide and deep rivers, rugged and lofty mountains and is beset with hostile savages. In one of his letters he says "Dr.  Whitman overtook us while we were traveling up the Platte.  I did not know before he joined us that he had been back to the Atlantic States."<br>
<br>
Doubtless you have all read the article quoted: "A Day with the Cow Column of 1843,- published ten years ago in the Overland Monthly.  Let me extract a few more lines, for very valuable is the opinion of Jesse Applegate, a man not given to flattery, one who speaks his mind, utters only his belief.  Says he: "I would fain now and here pay a passing tribute to that noble and devoted man, Dr. Whitman.<br>
<br>
"I will obtrude no other name upon the reader, nor would he, were he of our party or even living, but his stay with us was transient, though the good he did us permanent, and he long since died at his Post.  From tlye time he joined us on the Platte until he left us at Fort Hall, his great experience and indomitable energy were of priceless value to the migrating column.<br>
<br>
"His constant advice which we knew was based upon a knowledge of the road before us, was "travel, Travel, TRAVELI - nothing else will take you to the end of your journey; nothing is wise that does not help you along, nothing is good that causes a moments delay." His great authority as a physician and complete success in the case above referred to (Mr.  A. Had recounted an instance of his
skillful practice in his profession) saved us many prolonged and perhaps ruinous delays from similar causes, and it is no disparagement to others to say, that to no individual are the emigrants of 1843 so much indebted for the successful conclusion of their journey, as to Dr. Marcus Whitman."<br>
<br>
To have conducted that immense living caravan across the plains and over the Rocky Mountains, looked up to as responsible for its safety and health, to have been the direct agency who converted the great "experiment" into a triumphant success, was a glorious deed.  Dr. Whitman assumed that responaibility, ably he executed his trust.  True, the road to Green River had long been traversed , years before, our Missionary heroines had reached that rendezvous of Rocky Mountain men.  But there was yet a-stretch of doubt, difficulty and danger, before the Columbia River was reached.  Here was another "experiment," here was labor.<br>
<br>
Mr. Applegate happily says that the emigrants had learned to recognize "the Doctor as their good angel they With every confidence in him, followed where he led the way. That wagon train accompanied by their stock, that living caravan of American<br>
Pioneeers were poured into the Valley of the Willamette to occupy Oregon, "to hold the fort" until the Nation performed its duty to itself and to them.<br>
<br>
The broad American continent was traversed from ocean to ocean by a highway over which the Pacific coast received its accession of American population.  The American settlers of Oregon were no longer isolated from early home and kindred, cut off and exiled from their country.  Dr. Whitman's predictions were about to be fulfilled, "This country will be filled up with Americans."<br>
<br>
Day has broken on the American Oregon! A year later, in the great National contest of 1844, the people of both political parties were aroused to a sense that these American settlers were entitled to the protection of their country.  At the polls they thundered the Nation's verdict: "Oregon is ours." They echoed the sentiment of Marcus Whitman, It must and shall be filled by Americans.n<br>
<br>
Such is the record.  Such a few of the characteristics and remi-
niscences of that pure patriot and christian philanthropist. with his whole heart he loved his country and his race.  He hated Roman Catholicism.  Whether justly or unjustly, he regarded its introduction in this territory as a means adopted there and then to assist in defeating the United States from maintaining its rightful claim to Oregon.  He was exclusively, proscriptively, religiously an American.  For that he was immolated.  We have met here tonite gratefully to perpetuate the remembrance of that noble life, that eminent sacrifice.<br>

As Christians we shed the tear of regret at his untimely, tragic death; as Arericans we glory in his patriotism, his devotion, his full measure of service, his whole duty performed. with hearts full of gratitude we render thanks unto that God whom he never forgot, that we are now allowed peacefully to enjoy those blessings and benefits which his blood was so willingly poured out to secure.<br>

THE WHITMAN MASSACRE<br>
<br>
Clinton A. Snowden, "The Whitman Massacre," <B>History of Washington. The Rise and Progress of an American State.</B> New York: Century Publishing Company, 1909. Volume III p. 310-323.<br>
<br>
The morning of Monday, November 29th, was cold, foggy and cheerless.  Most of the sick people were better, though three were still dangerously iR.  The doctor wals ca but more serious than usual, still he went about among his patients, noting their condition and giving each a few words of advice or encouragement.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Whitman did not appear, and after breakfast was served one of the children carried some food to her room.  She was found sitting by her bed with her face buried in her handkerchief.  Taking the proffered food she motioned the bearer to leave her, and then put it aside.  It was found untouched long after.<br>
<br>
An Indian child was to be buried near the mission that morning, and while waiting for the funeral party to arrive the doctor conversed with Mr. Rogers, his assistant, telling him of the alarming report he had heard, and suggesting various means of conciliating the Indians.<br>
<br>
The Catholic bishop was coming to see him soon, Catherine Sager heard him say, and he thought he would have a favorable influence with them.  "If things do not clear up by that time," he added,, "I will move my family below."<br>
<br>
Although a large number of Indians had now assembled about the mission none but the family of the dead child had been present when it was buried.  The doctor remarked ttpbn this, on his return to the house, but added that they had probably come for their share of the beef which the men were killing for the use of the station.<br>

They were accustomed to assemble at such a time, and were always given a part of the slaughtered animal.  But they had not come that mothing for food.  It was easy to see that they were in an ugly humor, and more insolent and boisterous than usual.  Some of them had already thrust themselves into the kitchen and sitting,room, but as this was not an unusual circumstance no one was unduly alarmed by it.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Whitman came in and asked the doctor to go upstairs and see Miss Bewley, who was quite ill.  He did so and when he retumed he crossed the room to the sash door, that fronted the mill, and stood for a'few moments drumming on the glass with his fingers.<br>
<br>
Then turning to Mrs. Whitman he said:<br>
<br>
"Poor Lorinda is in trouble and does not know the cause.  I found her weeping, and she says she has some strong -presentiment of approaching evil that she cannot overcome.  I will prepare her some medicine and you take it up to her, and try to comfort her a little, for I have failed to do so."<br>
<br>
The poor girls fate was to be the  saddest  of  all  those  who<br>
escaped the slaughter.<br>
<br>
The Indians who were now in and about the house had become so noisy and insulting that Mrs. Whitman, who had been preparing some hot milk for the sick children, left the room.  Some of the Indians tried to follow her, but she closed the door in their faces and bolted it.  The doctor was bus at his medicine case, and apparently made no effort to quiet the increasing disturbance.<br>
<br>
An Indian stepped to his side and began to talk to him about medicine for a member of his family who was sick, when another struck him on the head from behind with a hatchet. At the same instant two shots were fired one of which struck him in the neck, and the other killed John Sager, who was in the room engaged in woorking with twine to make brooms.<br>
<br>
Other men who were employed in various capacities about the place were set upon at the same moment. The mission miller was shot dead at the first fire.  The tailor was mortally wounded by a pistol shot while sewing at his bench.  Mr. Kimball, one of the men who were engaged in slaughterin 9 the beef, was shot through the arm, the bullet shattering the bone and rendering it helpless.<br>
<br>
Mr. Canfield received a bullet in the side, but the wound was not dangerous, and he made his escape, going on foot to Lapwai, one hundred and twenty-five miles distant, to notify the Spaldings of their danger.  Mr. Hoffman was attacked by several Indians and defended himself bravely with an ax, wounding one of his assailants severely in the foot, but he was finally overpowered and killed.<br>

The crack of the murderers' rifles was heard plainly inside; the house and caused the greatest consternation.  The sick people sprang from their beds; some of the children ran crying out of doors, but were brought back by Mrs. Whitman, who did what she could to quiet them, although remembering what the doctor had told her during the previous evening, she evidently realized that the massacre had begun, and that her own life would soon be required.<br>
<br>
"Oh, the Indians, the Indians," she said repeatedly, they have killed my husband and I am a widow." Mary Ann Bridger, who had been in the kitchen when the doctor was  attacked, fled through<br>
an outer door, and hurried to the sick room where the women and children were.  She could only say that the doctor was dead, as she believed him to be.  Kimball came in with his shattered arm hanging by his side.  "Mrs.  Whitman, the Indians are killing us all," he said, and sank to the floor.<br>
<br>
He soon began to ask for water, and Mrs. Whitman went to an adjoining room and fetched him some.  Then she went downstairs and opened an outer door which had been locked, to let in a number of emigrant women and their children wha had collected there from the other buildings.  With the help of one of these she carried her wounded husband to an adjoining room.  He was still conscious but could answer her only in whispers.  She knelt by him and asked him many questions, but he could only answer "yes" or "no," as the case might be.<br>
<br>
As the shooting still continued she, would go to the sash door and look out for a moment, and then return saying, "Oh, that Joe Lewis is doing all this." Several times this wretch looked in at the window, but when she would ask, "What do you want, Joe?" he would turn away.  Some of the children called to her that Mr. Rogers was running toward the house, pursued by a party of Indians.<br>
<br>
She went to the door to let him in, but before she could do so he sprang against it, breaking some of the glass.  She opened it as soon as she could and let him in, and then closed and bolted it in the face of his pursuers.<br>
<br>
He had been shot through the wrist, and was also wounded in the head by a blow from a tomahawk.<br>
<br>
The schoolteacher had by this time come to the outside door, which was locked, and Mrs. Whitman motioned to him to, go back. He did so and had reached the foot of the stairway leading to the schoolroom, when he was attacked by an Indian with a knife-probably one of those the butchers had been using.  He grappled with his assailant and was making a brave struggle for his life, when a second Indian joined the first, and he was quickly overpowered-and killed.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Whitman and Catherine Sager were watching this deadly struggle from the window, when a bullet came crashing through the glass and struck Mrs. Whitman in the shoulder.  Clasping her hand over the
wound, she staggered to the room where her husband lay, and fell beside him.<br>
<br>
"I ran to her and tried to raise her up," Mrs. Pringle-who was Catherine Sager says, "but she said, 'Child, you cannot help me; save yourself.' We all crowded about her and began to weep.  She commenced praying for us: 'Lord save these little ones.' She repeated this many times.  She also prayed for her parents, saying, "This will kill my poor mother."<br>
<br>
The frightened women now retreated to the upper floor accompanied by the children, and Mr. Rogers helped Mrs. Whitman to her feet, and up the stairway to the hospital room, where she was laid alongside little Helen Mar Meek and two other sick children.  Rogers knelt by the bedside and began to pray.  The shooting by this time had ceased, but the crashing of breaking doors and windows gave notice to the trembling occupants of the sick room that their time had probably come.<br>
<br>
Kimball seized a broken gun with his unwounded hand, and taking his stand at the head of the stairway threatened to shoot the first Indians who would attempt to ascend it.  The cowardly wretches retired for a time, and after consulting together, one of them ad-
vanced toward the foot of the steps and said he had just arrived and would save them all if they would come down.<br>
<br>
"I - told mother, " says Mrs Pringle, "that I had seen this Indian killing the schoolteacher, but she thought I must be mistaken.  Then he said they were going to burn the house, and we must leave it.  I wrapped my little sister up and handed her to him, with the request that he would carry her.  He said they would take Mrs. Whitman away, and then come back for us.  Then all left save the children and Mr. Kimball.<br>
<br>
When they reached the room below,mother was laid upon a settee and carried out into the yard, by Mr. Rogers and Joe Lewis.  Having reached the yard, Joe dropped his end of the settee, and a volley of bullets laid Mr. Rogers, mother and brother Francis bleeding and dying on the ground.  While the Indians were holding a council to decide how to get Mrs. Whitman and Mr. Rogers into their hands, Joe Lewis had been sent to the schoolroom to get the schoolchildren.<br>
<br>
They had hid in the attic, but were ferreted out and brought to the kitchen, where they were placed in a row to be shot.  But the chief relented, and said they should not be hurt; but my brother Francis was killed soon afteer.  "<br>
<br>
The dropping of the settee with the wounded woman upon it,, by the inhuman balf-breed, had apparently been the signal for the final and most murderous volley.  Three persons had been killed or mortally wounded by it-a man, a noble self-sacrificing heroic woman, and a harmless orphan boy, not yet twelve years of age, who had already
done and suffered much in his short span of life.<br>
<br>
The butchery for that day was now finished.  All the grown men about the place except two, who were too sick to leave their beds, were either dead or wounded, or had escaped.  These two and one other would be slaughtered later.<br>
<br>
Nine persons in all were dead-the doctor and Mrs Whitman, John and Francis - Sager, Rogers, the assistant who had been shot while helping to carry Mrs. Whitman out of the building, and the wounded Kimball would die a few hours later, and three others including the two sick men, Sales and Bewley, would be butchered before the savage ferocity of their murderers was satisfied.<br>
<br>
A man named Hall, who with his wife and five daughters, the oldest a girl of ten and the youngest an infant, were wintering at the station, fled as soon as the shooting began, and carried the news of the massacre to Fort Walla Walla.  He appears to have been crazed with fear, and to have thought only of saving himself.  After securing some food at the fort he resumed his journey to the Willamette, and is supposed to have been drowned some days later near the Des Chutes River.<br>
<br>
Mr. and Mrs. Osborne, both of whom were sick, managed to conceal themselves and' their three children beneath the floor during the day, and at night made their escape.  About three miles from the mission they hid themselves in the bushes until the next night, when, after traveling about five miles, Mrs. Osborne gave up and could go no further.  Taking one of the children Mr. Osborne made his way to the fort, from which men and horses were promptly sent to Mrs. Osborne's rescue.<br>
<br>
On learning what had happened, McBean, the 'chief trader in charge, sent his interpreter, and his Indian wife, accompanied by another Indian, to the mission "to tell the Chief, Telequiet," as he says, "that his young men had already gone too far by killing Dr. Whitman and his wife, and the rest; that they had acted a cruel and cowardly part, and that I wanted him to spare the poor women and children.  When my messenger arrived, Indian women, armed with knives and other implements of war, were already assembled near where the captives were, awaiting-the order of the Chief, Telequiet, who was present.<br>
<br>
"On being informed of my request, he hung down his head and paused; then with a wave of his hand preemptorily ordered the women away-
these abusing him and calling him a coward." These messengers evidently arrived none too soon, for Mrs. Pringle says their arrival was very opportune.  Apparently it saved the schoolchildren, who were already prepared for the slaughter, from their fate.<br>
<br>

The slaughter seems to have begun some time in the afternoon; it was not finished until evening, and then the murderers seemed to be reluctant to quit their bloody work.  All the men then about the station were either dead or mortally wounded.  Their families were in the various buildings which they had been occupying.  The sick and the orphan children, who had been Mrs. Whitman's special care, were huddled together in the hospital room, and the wounded Kimball was with them.<br>
<br>
As night came on their terrors increased.  During the day they had been too much excited by the shooting, by the comings and goings of the Indians and the savage half-breed who had been their willing messenger, by the murders which had been committed before their eyes, by caring for the wounded, and by the momentary expectation of their own slaughter; to take note of the passing of time.  But now that the terrifying noises were no longer heard, and the darkness began to gather about them, the horror of their situation more completely enveloped and appalled them.<br>
<br>
The Indians did not early leave the place and return to their own homes.  They seemed to be doubting and deliberating what to do next.  Their coward hearts forbade .them to do what they most wished to do.  The alarmed watchers could hear them coming and going and consu Iting together.  Finally they began to break down the doors and windows, destroy the furniture, and pile the splintered remains of it together upon the floors.<br>
<br>
Occasionally the watchers heard talk of fire, and from the noise made in the preparations, they knew that they were arranging to burn the building.    "We now thought,"says Mrs.Pringle,"that we were to be burned ative in the ruins of our home, but strange to say I experienced a feeling of relief at the thought.  Anything rather than meet again those fierce savages with their knives.<br>
<br>
But they listened in vain for the kindling flames. Finally they heard one of the Indians addressing the others.  Th speech continued for some time and then all was still.  They had evidently left the premises.  Three of the children were very sick.  Their clothing was wet with blood, from lying on the bed with Mrs. Whitman after she was wounded.  They had no fire or light.  " I tried to put the children to sleep," says Mrs. Pringle, "reasoning with myself that if we could lose consciousness in slumber, the roof of the burning house would fall upon us and we would not know it."<br>
<br>
"The sick children were suffering for water, and begged for it continually.  A cupful had been brought in, the night previous, for one of the sick, and search was made for it, but in the darkness it was overturned.  The disappointment only seemed to increase  their  thirst.   The pitcher which Mrs.   Whitman   had   brought   for Kimball still   stood on the floor beside him, but he said the water was blood and not fit to drink.  
As the hours dragged slowly along, the children, one after another, forgot their thirst and their terrors, and fell asleep.  Finally only Kimball and I remained awake.  I sat upon the side of the bed," she says, watching hour after hour while the horrors of the day passed and repassed before my mind.  I had always been much afraid of the dark, but now I felt that it was a protection to us, and I dreaded the coming of the daylight.  Again I would think, with a shudder, of the dead who were lying in the room below.  I remember yet how terrible the striking of the clock sounded.  "<br>
<br>
The wounded schoolteacher, Rogers, still lay on the ground outside and the terrified watchers could occasionally hear him praying: "Come, Lord Jesus, come quickly." He often repeated this until his voice failed, and they knew he was dead.<br>
<br>
While it was still dark some of the sick children awoke and renewed their piteous appeals for water.  As all was now quiet below Kimball told Catherine Sager that if she  would tear up one of the sheets and help him to bandage his wounded arm he would try and get them some.<br>
<br>
She hesitated at first, saying that "mother would not like to have the sheets torn." But he replied, "Poor child do you not know that your mother is dead, and will never have any more use for the sheets ? " With some difficulty his arm was bound up, and a blanket was tied over his shoulders, as he Was afraid that he might faint when he got outside and suffer from the cold while unconscious.<br>
<br>
Being thus prepared he took the pitcher and went do stairs.  They waited for him  but  he  did  not  return.  They  never  saw  him  again alive.<br>
<br>
When morning dawned the Indians began to return.  They searched through the buildings for Hall and Osborne, who had escaped, and not being able to find them they went to the kitchen and prepared themselves breakfast, from the food they found there.  After a time they sent Joe Lewis with several Indians to induce the women and children above stairs to come down, pretending that they were going to take them to the fort, as soon as a team could be got readyThey asked what made the children cry, and when told that they were hungry and wanted water, one of them went for water and one for food.<br>
<br>
But the supply they brought was so small that the children were not satisfied and begged for more, but the Indians seemed to think they had done enough for them and refused to exert themselves further.  Finally the party were made ready and taken downstairs.  The bodies of the dead lay all about them.  That of John Sager, who had been one of the first killed, still lay on the kitchen floor where he had fallen, and that of his brother Francis, and Mr. Rogers just outside.  Dr. Whitman's was in the sitting room.<br>
<br>
The Indians had spread blankets or quilts taken from the beds over
most of these.  One of the little children lifted the quilt from Dr. Whitman's face and said, "Oh, girls, come and see father!" Some of them did so and saw a sight which they never afterwards forgot.  The face had been brutally mutilated with a tomahawkFather Brouillet says there were three deep wounds in it.<br>
<br>
No attempt was made during that day by the Indians to move or bury any of these bodies.  The women and children were compelled to pass by, and sometimes over them, as they were removed to one of the smaller mission houses, which was to be their prison for some days to come.  No preparation was made to take them to the fort.  There was no intention of taking them there.<br>
<br>
On the morning of the second day after the massacre Father Brouillet appeared.  He had left Umatilla on the morning following Dr. Whitman's departure, on a mission to the various Indian tribes.  At Fort Walla Walla he learned of the massacre and hastened to Waiilatpui.<br>
<br>
Before reaching the mission he was asked to visit some children who were sick, and did so, baptizing three of them.  For this he was very severely censured, in after years, by Mr. Spalding, who charged that "he had baptized the children of the murderers whose hands were still wet with blood of their victims," before he had made any effort to ascertain whether he could be of service, either to the living or dead, at the scene of the massacre.<br>
<br>
It has been claimed in his defense that it was his duty, as a priest, to minister to the dying before attending to the dead.<br>
Qn arriving at the scene of the massacre he found that Joe Stansfield was already preparing a grave.  Many Indians were gathered about, some of whom still had arms in their hands, and regarded him with no evidence of favor.<br>
<br>
None of them offered help to bury their victims, or prepare them for burial.  Nor did he attempt to encourage them to render any.  He was content if they would leave him alive until the work could be completed.<br>
<br>
Stansfield, assisted by the priest finished the grave during the afternoon.  It was about three feet deep, and wide enough to contain the eleven bodies, Mr. Pringle says.  Then the priest, with this one assistant, collected the bodies and placed them side by side, unshrouded and coffinless, in the grave they had prepared, and covered them over.<br>
<br>
During  the whole time they were at work Father Brouillet says he watched the Indians with anxious eyes, not knowing what minute he might be struck down, and laid beside those for whom he was now piously performing the last services which one human being can render to his kind.  They did not molest him, however, nor did they help him until his work was completed and he rode away.
Some months later the soldiers found that wolves had dug up some of these bodies and devoured them.  They gathered up the bleaching bones again and replaced them in the earth, and sixty years later the place was suitably and appropriately marked with a monument.<br>
<br>
So Marcus Whitman and his heroic wife died and were buried.  After sacrificing home and friends, to live among savages; after leading the way across a continent, and braving the terrors of a wildeness which women, and men with women had never before involved; after spending eleven years in an almost hopeless effort to reclaim the savage, to teach him to live better and be better than he was, offering him peace and good will, and health and abundance in place of war, savagery, sickness and starvation; and often receiv-
ing little in return except insolence and abuse, which they bore patiently, following the example of Him who when he was reviled, reviled not again, they were murderously struck down on their own threshold and under the roof which their own hands had raised, by the inhuman wretches for whom they had done most and suffered most.<br>

<br>
Marcus Whitman visited Fort Vancouver in 1835, returned the next year with his bride Narcissa and the Spaldings.  Arrival of the two white women marked a turning point in Northwest history and helped launch the Oregon fever to settle this region. Massacre of the Whitmans in 1847 spurred Congress in 1848 to create the Oregon Territory with a governor and estahlish Vancouver Barracks as a military hase at Vancouver in 1849.  Ed<br>
<br>
Marcus and Narcissa Whitman 's lives were full of idealism,<br>
adventure and hard work.  They were wonderfully suited for each other.  Marchs was a doctor who had always wanted to be a minister.  Narcissa was a teacher who had dreamed of serving as a missionary since she was a young child.  After the Whitman's were married on February 18, 1836, they started west together, hoping to bring Christianity and civilization to the Indians in the
<br>
Oregon country.  They met another young missionary couple, the reverend Henry Spalding and his wife Eliza who would accompany them.<br>
<br>
It was a grueling trip.  Narcissa and Eliza were congratulated when they reached the South Pass in Wyoming as they were the first white women to cross the Rockies.  They had met up with fur traders, who helped guide them.  On September 1st, the travelers arrived at Fort Walia Walla, a Hudson's Bay Company trading post.  They were given rooms and food as they were very weary from their long journey.<br>
<br>
They were received at Fort Vancouver, the headquarters of the Hudson's Bay Company, which was built in 1825.  They were once again given food and rooms where they could rest.  Dr. McLaughlin showed them fields of oats, wheat and barley.  They saw many fruit trees and a large vegetable garden.  Seeing these fields and crops, Dr. Whitman was determined to do the same.<br>
<br>
The men returned to the Walia Walla area and found the land they wanted at a place called Waiilatpu.  Henry and Eliza Spalding wished to set up camp among the Nez Perce Indians and so they traveled a hundred more miles to Lapwai where   they   were welcomed graciously.<br>
<br>
Waiilatpu had the Walla Walla river running near by, which would provide good water.  The land was flat, perfect for planting corn, wheat and vegetables.  A trapper warned the missionaries, urging them not to settle on this land, that this was Cayuse hunting grounds and they were bad Indians.  The trapper also warned them saying, "Remember these Indians are still savages.  They want to know about God to gain power.  They think our God will give them power to kill their enemies."'<br>
<br>
Marcus understood this but was determined and believed that although they were savages now he would soon convert them into gentle Christians.  The Cayuse Indians immediately surrounded the Whitman's wanting to take a look at the newcomers.  The warriors invited them to stay, but when asked to help build a mission house the Indians were very disturbed with the idea replying, "We are warriors, not workers."' Mr. Whitman with the help of others including a couple of young Indians built a mission house.  With this accomplished the Whitmans were ready to begin their teaching of God.<br>
<br>
Dr. Whitman found that many of the Indians were sick, the dead were lying around, unburied, and the insides of their tepees were dirty.  He started right away taking care of the sick Indians, and convincing them to do as he said or more Indians would die.  The
warriors were to clean the tepees, wash the sick and bury their dead.  This helped the Cayuses' condition greatly, making the sickness and unsanitary conditions scarce in their tribe.<br>
<br>
With this under control, Dr. Whitman asked if the Cayuse would come to the mission and learn about God and Christian ways.  The Indians did attend and Marcus talked to them, telling stories, and Narcissa sang songs.  The Cayuse enjoyed this very much replying, "Good, good, with smiles on their faces."3 Marcus tried to convince the Indians to take part in the planting of the crops, so as to have enough food for everyone.  The Indians refused to do any farming.  Marcus managed to plant the corn, wheat, vegetables and fruits with the help from the other settlers.<br>
<br>
Every Sunday Dr. Whitman preached to the Indians.  The Indians still liked the Bible stories, but they didn't want white man's God, who didn't bring them extra power to kill their enemies and they became angry.  Marcus Whitman was starting to lose hope, exclaiming to Narcissa, <B>"It </B>will be a long, long time before we make Christians out of these Indians."<br>
<br>
After getting settled and working with the Indians, the Whitman's were blessed with a little baby girl named Alice Clarissa.  The Whitman's were overjoyed with their new baby and the Indians were very excited to see the new baby also.  After this great event, Marcus and the Indians added a school room to the mission house and Narcissa began teaching the Indian children.<br>
<br>
Narcissa and Dr. Whitman lost their baby later in a drowning accident.  This was devastating for the Whitman's, but shortly afterwards the Whitman's took in children who had lost their parents on the way to the Pacific Northwest.  Now the Whitman house was full of children's laughter, however, the Whitman's would never forget their baby Alice.<br>
<br>
Increasingly, families were settling in Waiilatpu, this helped Dr. Whitman.  With more helpers to build the building and grow the crops, Dr. Whitman could spend more time teaching and doctoring the Indians.  The mission was becoming a large, comfortable place with peace all around.  Marcus was finding that the older Indians wouldn't change their ways.<br>
<br>
As numerous wagons came in and settled in Waiilatpu, the Indians started to get angry.  The Indians were afraid the white man would take over their land.  Things became worse when the Indians came down with the measles.  The disease was brought over with the new settlers and it spread among the Indians and other settlers.<br>

"Marcus tried to doctor them but they had it worse than the whites and over 200 Indians died including both of chief Tilaukait's sons."' The chief blamed Marcus for his sons' deaths and told him that he would get revenge.  An Indian friend Istikus begged Dr. Whitman to take the settlers and leave, explaining that many of the Indians had bad hearts right now and for them to come back when the Indian's hearts were good again.<br>
<br>
Dr. Whitman thought nothing of it, as he had come to the Northwest to help the Indians and he had already done so much for them, he never thought they would turn on him.<br>
<br>
The chief went from tepee to tepee saying, "Doctor Whitman is poisoning us.  He wants us all to die so his friends can have our land."6 The Cayuse were very angry when they heard this news and started immediately to plan an attack on the mission.  On November 29, 1847 the Cayuse surrounded the mission.<br>
<br>
Dr. Whitman was at his desk when an Indian came in, explaining that he was sick and wanted some medicine.  While Dr. Whitman's attention was engaged by this sick Indian, chief Tilaukait came in and hit the doctor on the head with a tomahawk, he died a few hours later.<br>
<br>
There was a brave boy who was sitting next to Dr. Whitman when this murder occurred.  The boy tried to shoot Tahamas with a pistol, but was struck down with the same weapon and instantly killed.  Narcissa realizing that the end was at hand cried out, "I am a widow! I am a widow!," exclaiming "That Joe, that Joe he has done it all."'<br>
<br>
"Only four men made their escape unharmed to carry the news of this horrible massacre to Fort Vancouver, and get help." Mrs. Whitman was struck by flying bullets coming through a window as she was helping to calm everyone.  <B>It </B>was said that Mrs. Whitman stayed under control and helped everyone to stay calm and rational during this terrible day.  Mrs. Whitman had been struck in the breast by an Indian she had done so much for,  Tahamas.  She later died with some of her friends when they were helping her into another room and were hit with another string of bullets.<br>
<br>
The children witnessed these terrible acts as they were huddled together in a corner of the house.  All of the survivors were kept as prisoners in the emigrant house.  The Cayuse knew that it was a long way to Fort Vancouver and so they had no fears of an attack from another source for quite a while.  "For five days they kept up their orgies, guarding against escape of their victims."9 The Indian's got anxious at the end of the fifth day and decided to take the prisoners to a friendly Indian tribe.<br>
<br>
When chief Ogden of the Hudson Bay Company received the news of
the massacre he lost no time in getting to Waiilatpu, where they found, "everything in ruins, the houses wrecked, the mill burned and the dead bodies of eleven men, one boy, besides the bodies of Dr. and Mrs. Whitman."<br>
<br>
The bodies were gathered together and buried together in what has been called ever since, "The Great Grave".<br>
<br>
While this was taking place, Ogden sent runners after the Indians to order them to release all captives to Fort Walla Walla and to assure them that Chief Ogden would pay them handsomely if they all were brought in safely.  All the captives were brought to Fort Walla Walla except for a couple of children who died from the cold.  "Ogden gave the Cayuse Indian's blankets, shirts, guns, ammunition, and tobacco to the value of five hundred dollars."'<br>
<br>
The rescued men, women, and children were then taken to Fort Vancouver.  "The leaders in the massacre, Tilcokait, Tahamas, Quichmarsum, Kivakamus, and Sichsalucus were arrested and hung at Oregon City." All the land was closed to white settlers for over ten years, on the grounds that the government was not able to protect the scattered settlement.<br>
<br>
The work of the American board in sending missionaries to Oregon has sometimes been called "a disaster" or "failure" but it really did have several positive aspects.  Although, there were numerous Cayuse Indians that didn't want to have anything to do with Christianity, there were still plenty that did.  Many still read the Bible and sang the songs on Sundays.<br>
<br>
"There were forty-five Cayuse and one thousand Nez Perces who have kept up regular family worship, singing from the old hymn books, translated into their own language by Mrs. Spalding.  Many of them showed surprising evidence of piety."13 Schools and churches were built and soon the little area formed into a town called Walla Walla.<br>
<br>
The missionaries had set an example for others by showing how they succeeded in setting up a colony and worked so hard, with dedication for their country.<br>

WHITMAN MASSACRE.<br>
<br>
Archie Binns, "The Whitman Massacre," <B>Roaring Land.</B> New York: Robert M. McBride and Company, 1942. p. 202-06<br>

After the United States had won the Oregon country, she had to pay for it in blood.  Early in December of the first American year, a Hudson's Bay courier hurried down the great river with shocking news: Cayuse Indians had massacred the Whitmans and ten others at the mission, and fifty women and children were being held prisoners.<br>
<br>
Possibly from force of habit, the courier brought the news to Fort Vancouver, without warning Americans on the way.  Across the Columbia, on the Willamette, was the semi-official Oregon Provisional Government, whose Governor Abernathy was notified through Fort Vancouver.  Pioneers who had recently crossed the plains were called to arms; while they were organizing, a rescue expedition left from Fort Vancouver.<br>
<br>
The expedition was led by Peter Skene Ogden, who had written so facetiously about the missionaries.  Besides being a wit, the dwarfish giant with the falsetto voice was one of the most fearless men the West has ever known.  He had roamed all the wild country west of the Rockies, explored around Salt Lake and the Nevada desert, left his name at Ogden, Utah, and discovered the Humboldt River of California.  McLoughlin had always sent Ogden when it was necessary to punish Indians or perform other hazardous work.<br>
<br>
With a handful of company men, Ogden went directly to the mission on the Walla Walla, buried the dead, and cajoled the seething Cayuses into exchanging their captives for a few hundred dollars' worth of trade goods.  There were forty-seven women and children in the rescued party. Many <B>of </B>them ghastly looking from measles, and all of them suffering from exposure and abuse by the Indians.<br>
<br>
Everyone was accounted for except a few single men who had been working in distant parts of the mission settlement, and the Osborne family.  The Osbornes had been in the house where the Whitmans and several others were killed, but they had disappeared and were neither among the rescued nor the dead.<br>
<br>
Ogden and his party left the desolated mission and returned by way of Fort Walla Walla.  There he found the Osborne family, who bad escaped massacre through the presence of mind of their little girl Nancy.  While the resigned family was gathered around the bed of her sick brother, with the Indians breaking in, she remembered some loose boards in the floor and suggested that they hide there.  Lying under the floor, they heard the Indians kill Mrs. Whitman and a man and a boy in the room above them.<br>
<br>
After dark they escaped from the house and started for Fort Walla Walla, thirty miles away, hiding in the brush by day while Indians looked for them, and walking at night on frozen ground covered with snow.  All of them were sick or convalescing from measles,
and they had to carry the two-year-old and the sick boy on that nightmare journey.  When they reached Fort Walla Walla their nightmare was increased.  Through fear of the Indians or hatred of the Americans, Factor McBean shut the door in their faces.  They wandered away, but later returned and practically forced admission to the fort.<br>
<br>
Ogden's men loaded all the survivors into bateaux and started for Fort Vancouver; when they were part way down the river, they met the Oregon Volunteers coming up.<br>
<br>
The Whitman massacre was a strange mixture of the inevitable and accidental, and of irony.  In ten years of conscientious work, the Whitmans had not been able to win the complete confidence of the Indians.  With the passing of time and the arrival of more settlers to occupy their land, the Indians had become distrustful.  New emigrants brought the germs of measles, which killed scores of Indians.<br>
<br>
Marcus Whitman was a physician and he did what he could; but doctors knew very little about the disease at the time, and it killed a number of white people at the mission, as well as Indians.<br>
<br>
The misery on both sides of the mission walls was fused into horror by a Red River half-breed with some obscure hatred of the Whitmans or the white race.  He persuaded the Indians that they were dying of poison which Dr. Whitman had given them in the guise of medicine.<br>
<br>
Narcissa Whitman understood what was working in the Indians' minds; one of the touching scenes in the last hours at the mission was when an Indian came into the room where one of the Osborne children had died of measles, and Narcissa Whitman uncovered the dead child to show him that the white people, too, had suffered.<br>
<br>
Marcus Whitman was the man of iron who had ridden across the continent in winter to save his mission and the Oregon country; and the stubborn strength that makes him live in history brought him death in the flesh.  He would not believe that the Indians were plotting against him, and he calmly read a book <B>while the steep pyramid hill</B> in front of the mission darkened with Indians who gathered like a swarm of bees.  He looked up from his book only when the tomahawk was descending upon his head.<br>
<br>
The Whitmans and ten others met the death of martyrs; but Whitman had already done his great work and he died a conqueror.  While he and Narcissa and their followers slept in a common grave, wagon trains rolled along the Oregon Trail, with white tops swaying
through clouds of dust, and dusty American faces turned toward the lands of the West.<br>
<br>
The Whitman massacre and the settlers' war with the Cayuse Indians delayed only the settlement of the country east of the mountains; this delay was further prolonged by the general Indian War which followed.  But nothing could stop the westward march of a people, and the Whitmans died in one of the battles of a war that was already won.<br>

WHITMAN MASSACRE.<br>
<br>
Catherine Sager was the eldest daughter of Henry and Naomi Sager, who started across the plains to Oregon in 1844.  Both patents died before reaching the end of their joumey and the seven orphan children found refuge at the Whitman mission and remained there until the massacre in 1847.  The two boys, John and Francis, were killed in the massacre and one girl died a few days later.<br>
<br>
Catherine and her three sisters were brought to Oregon City with the other survivors.  They could no longer be together, but were placed with different families.  Catherine found a home with the Reverend 'William Roberts.  A son of Mr. Roberts wrote to his grandparents in New Jersey mentioning by name the orphan girl who had become a member of his household.<br>
<br>
His letter was printed in the Methodist paper, the Christian Advocate.  Frederic Sager saw it, and remembering that his brother Henry had a daughter Catherine, addressed, a letter to "Catherine Sager, Somewhere in Oregon," and sent it across the plains by an immigrant.  It was finally posted at Salem and there she received it.<br>
<br>
The letter printed below is Catherine's answer, giving her uncle news of herself and sisters and a vivid account of the 'Whitman massacre as she remembered it.<br>
<br>
The original letter, of which this is a copy, is owned by Charles F. Keezer, Ericson, Nebraska, whose mother was a first cousin of Catherine Sager Pringle.<br>
Salem Dec. 21 1854<br>
Dear Uncle:<br>
<br>
We received your letter yesterday.  You can hardly realize with what pleasure we have made inquiry of everyone we saw from Ohio. 
You wished in the first place to know how many of us remain.  There are four of us, Catherine, Elizabeth Maria, Matilda Jane and Henrietta Naomi.  In the second place you asked where we were.<br>
<br>
I am married and am living on a farm four miles from Salem.  I was married to Clark Spencer Pringle on the 25 th of October, 1851. We own a full section of land, that is 640 acres.  Elizabeth and Henrietta have been living with us ever since we were married.<br>
<br>
Matilda lives with a gentleman about 30 miles from here by the name of Geiger.  She has lived in his family seven years.  She is like a daughter to them.  She will be married in the course of a few months to Lewis Hazlett.  Elizabeth is teaching school.  She has taught off and on for the last three years.  I do not know whether she will marry soon or not.  She is engaged but will not marry she says till she has made something.<br>
<br>
I will 20 years old on the 17th of next April.  E will be 18 the 6th Gf July.  M will be 16 the 6th of October, H will be II the 22d of may.  She was a baby 5 months old when mother died in the spring of 44.  'We started for Oregon in good heart and spirits about July' I think it was.  I fell out of the wagon, the wheels passing over me broke oxie leg very badly.<br>
<br>
Father would not allow a doctor to be called but set and tended it himself.  I have got over it n that knew me ow so I hardly limp at all to the surprise of all then.  A lady who was present at the time told me a few days ago that she never expected to see me live.<br>
<br>
In a few days after this accident father took what they called the yellow fever, a species of the camp fever, of which he died.  He put his family in care of the captain of the company and requested him to leave them at Dr. 'Whitmans.  I was too young then to notice dates so I cannot tell you when he died, but I think it was in August.<br>
<br>
Mother's health was very feeble at the time of his death and the care of a family of seven children, one a babe and me helpless and as much trouble as an infant, besides perplexities of travelling, soon broke her down.  She became delirious before she took her bed and at times was perfectly insane.  The way she called and moaned and called her Henry during these spells was heart rending and I shall never forget it but, poor woman, she did not have long<br>
to mourn for in 26 days she followed her beloved husband.<br>
<br>
A few days before she died she was conscious and bid us all adieu; told us that we must be good children; she then called the driver of our team and told tm him to take her children over to Dr. whi ans and he done so She then became unconscious and remained so till she died.  She died so easy no one knew for several hours that she was dead but supposed her to be sleeping.<br>
<br>
She was buried without a coffin on the banks of Willow Creek and
many tears were shed by the kind hearted company for the poor little orphans that stood around her grave.  We were all taken care of by the company.  There was not one but that would share their bread with US.  'We arrived at Dr. 'Whitmans the 17th of October.<br>
<br>
They could not find it in their hearts to refuse the dying request of our parents nor give a heedless ear to our urgent request not to be parted.  They took the whole seven.  They had no children of their own but they had orphans enough to make eleven.  'We called them father and mother and so they were to us while they lived.  'We were all fed, well clothed, and sent to school every winter.  They took every means to make us happy.  They employed a teacher in the family every winter.<br>
<br>
We lived there about three years and a half, that is till 47, when by a mysterious stroke of providence we were again thrown upon the wide world without home and deprived of two dearly beloved brothers and a much petted sister Hannah Loisa.<br>
<br>
The emigration of 47 brought the measles among the Indians and great numbers of them died.  I have known five to be buried in one day.  The Catholic priest had come among them; also Dr. Whitman had taken into his family a half breed that had come in with the emigration.<br>
<br>
This person, the priest and the measles all combined brought about the massacre.  Poor Doctor rode about all day tending the sick natives and all night he was up with his family and other white folks that had stopped at his station to winter.  Everyone of his family was down at once excepting the half breed I have told you of whose name was Joe Lewis, and his wife.  Joe Lewis told the Indians that the Dr. was poisoning them.<br>
<br>
On Saturday night before the massacre Dr. and Mr. Spalding, his colleague, started for the Umatilla river about 25 miles from home to see some sick Indians and were gone all the next day.  At about 10 o'clock Sunday night Dr. came back.  My brother was setting up with us they having got well.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Whitman had been up all the night before with Henrietta who was supposed to be dying.  I remember just how my dear brothers looked as, with their shoes off for fear of making a noise, they moved around waiting on us for it was the last time I ever saw them alive.  As soon as the Dr. came they went to bed.<br>
<br>
He looked at each child and when he came to Helen,' a little girl living with him, he called Mrs. Whitman and told her that Helen was dying.  He sat down and watched her until she finally got better.  He told Mrs. 'W. that an Indian named Sticus had told him that that evening the Indians were talking of killing him; that Joe Lewis was putting them up to it.  He spent a sleepless night for he was in trouble.  The next day, which was the fatal 29th of November, he was talking and said if things did not look brighten
by April he was going to leave, but, said he "if I am to die by the hands of Catholics my death will do more good than my life."<br>
<br>
After giving some directions reference to the children, three of whom were past hope, the little girl I spoke of above and my two youngest sisters, he went, to bury an Indian.  When he came back he said the Indians were gathered about but be supposed it was because they were killing a beef that day and they always came around on such days to get what was thrown away.  He said that none of them were at the funeral.<br>
<br>
He went upstairs to see a young lady who was sick. We found her crying bitterly but she could not tell why.  He came down and stood at the window a few moments as in deep thought and then said<br>
poor L is in trouble and cannot tell why.  I will get her some medicine and you had better go and talk to her awhile." He went to the medicine case to get some.<br>
<br>
While Mrs. 'W went into the pantry to get some milk the Indians crowded around demanding some.  She told them to wait till she gave some to her children.  She then came into the sitting room where we were and locked the door after her as the Indians were not allowed in that room.  They still kept asking for the Milk and Mrs.  W started to get some for them. just as she got to the door they asked for the Dr. She said "Dr. you are wanted."<br>
<br>
He went out and she fastened the door after him.  Presently we heard a very loud talk in the kitchen but paid no attention to it till we heard a gun go off and immediatexly followed by another one.  'We could not tell what it was but started to run.<br>
<br>
Mrs. 'W called us back and started for the kitchen exclaiming "oh they have killed my husband." By this time the shooting had become general.  Mrs. 'W brought a pillow and put it under his head.  He was not dead.  She asked him if he knew her.  He said ce yes." She asked him if she could do anything to stop the bleeding.  He said no.  "Can you speak to me?" He answered no."<br>
<br>
Mr. Rodgers," a young man living with us, now came in with his arm broken and Mrs. 'W was standing at the window looking out at the slaughter without when a ball hit her in the shoulder.  She screamed and fell to the floor but her wound did not trouble her.  It was her children.  "Oh what will become of my little onest Lord, save these little ones" came in heart rending tones from her lips time and again.<br>
<br>
I was standing looking over her shoulder a minute before she was shot but seeing the Indians trying to kill the school teacher" I could not stand it and went up stairs, Mr. Rodgers carrying the sick children and then helped Mrs. 'W to get up.  The Indians now broke into the house.  After looking all over they broke in the stairway door.  'We placed a broken gun over the bannister as if to shoot.  
They were frightened and retired.  For the space of an hour all was stal as death except the low voice of Mr. R. engaged in prayer for the safety of all.<br>
<br>
'We now heard footsteps approaching as one in great haste.. They stopped at the door and a voice called Mr. Rodgers.  He did not answer.  The Indian kept calling and he finally answered and asked what he wanted.  The Indian told him that he had nothing to do with the massacre and wanted Mr. R to come down which he refused to do, desiring him to come up there but the Indian said that he would not; that we had white folks up there that would kill him.<br>
<br>
After much parley Mr. P, finally went to the bottom of the stairs and talked with and finally got him upstairs.  He shook hands with us all; was very sorry for what had happened, especially Mrs. 'W being shot.  He then told us he wanted us to leave the house as the Indians were going to burn it down.<br>
<br>
He appeared so kind we began to get ready to go, Mrs. 'W saying "God has raised us up a friend." He told us children to wait till he came back.  They all went down leaving us and a wounded man but they hardly got outside the door into the yard wheia the treacherous mortal friend fired on them, killed Mr. R, Mrs. 'W and brother Francis.  He had with the other children who had got well enough been in school when the massacre commenced.<br>
<br>
They all climbed into the loft.  'When the Indians took the other children down he stayed up there and had he only remained until night he might have escaped but his anxiety respecting his sister would not allow him to stay.  He came down and the first thing he saw was his brother lying on the floor shot and his throat cut and his tippet stuffed into the wound.  Francis pulled the tippet out.  John tried to speak but died in the attempt.  Francis burst into tears and taking sister Matilda by the hand said "I will soon follow my brother.<br>
<br>
If you are spared, be a good girl and meet me in heaven." He was shot soon after by Joe Lewis.  But why dwell on these awful scenes or try to describe the night we spent in that chamber or our feeling when, next morning, surrounded by murderers we looked at the mingled corpses of our beloved second parents and our brothers.<br>
<br>
I have given you a short account of this horrible massacre but to give you a definite idea of it is impossible.  They were buried the following 'Wednesday in one large grave but it was so shallow the wolves dug them up before we left and their bones are scattered.  About five days after this Loisa died.  'We lived prisoners a month when wc were ransomed by Mr. Ogden of the Hudson's Bay Company.  He died lately. It was with joy mingled with tears that we bid farewell to the home that had been so
pleasant and the place of so much calamity.<br>
<br>
We left the graves of the loved ones behind.  'We arrived at Ore-
gon City in January and were loudly saluted by the troops on their way to make war with the Indians.  The war continued some time and was finally concluded by their giving five of the chief murderers who were hung in Oregon City.<br>
<br>
The poor fellows shed tears when they found they had to swing but it done no good.  They wanted to be shot but hanging was the law.<br>
<br>
We all found homes right off but had to be parted.  I lived with Rev.  'W.  Roberts and was the girl spoken of in the Advocate you spoke of.<br>
<br>
I lived with them till I was married and they done well by me.  Matilda has lived in the same place all the time.  E. and H have changed places several times so after all here I am settled down in sober married life and a little girl with blue eyes calls me by the name of ma.<br>
<br>
We heard by the emigration that came the year after us that the Indians had robbed father's grave, leaving his bones to bleach on the prairie.<br>
<br>
Perhaps you would like to know something of this country.  'We have had up to this time very little rain, the nights being cold, the sun shining warm and pleasant during the day.  Crops are generally good.  'times are rather dull there being no cash in the country.  'Wheat is six bits a bushel in cash and a dollar in trade.  Potatoes are 2 5 to 5 0 cents per bushel.<br>
<br>
Wages are from one to two dollars per day.  There is too much merchandise in the country and no public improvements.  'We would like very much to have grandpas dageufreotype if you would send it to us and as many more as you are able to send us.  'We want to know how our kin folks look.  I want you to write and tell us how many uncles and aunts we have and their names.  Have you any cha-
dren? 'What are our cousins names and how many of them? What is grandpas name and what was grandmas name? How old was father when he died and where was he born; Also what was mother's age?<br>
<br>
I did not tell you the name of our daughter.  We call her Kate Virginia.  I have written you a long letter but it was necessary to let you know our history.  Remember us to all the relations and tell thcxn to write.  Direct your letters to Salem, Marion Co., O.T.<br>

WHITMAN MASSACRE.<br>
<br>
Edwin Eells, "The Whitman Massacre," <B>Building A State.</B> Tacoma: Washington State Historical Society, 1939, p. 474-484.<br>
<br>
On the 29th of November, 1847, two Indian men came in to Dr. Whitman's room and asked for some medicine.  He gave a bottle to one of them, and while giving directions as to its use, the other man slipped slyly and noiselessly behind <B>him, </B>drew his tomahawk from his belt under his blanket and struck the Doctor a blow on the top of his head.  His head dropped to his breast, and the Indian struck him a second blow, when he fell senseless to the floor.<br>
<br>
This was the signal for a general attack.  About seventy-five people were at the settlement.  During that and the following days, fourteen persons, one a woman, Mrs. Whitman, were killed; some few escaped, and more than fifty women and children<br>
were taken prisoners.<br>
<br>
There were no mails, but I well remember the circumstances under which we received the dreadful news.<br>
<br>
A short time before these occurrences a painter by the name of J. M. Stanley who had been making portraits of  some of the principal Indians in the Spokane and Colvile country, and was stopping temporarily at Tshimakain, wished to go to Walla Walla.  My father and Mr. Walker furnished him horses and an Indian guide.  On his way he camped one night on the Touchet, a creek about twenty miles from Walla.<br>
<br>
While he was there, an old Indian and his wife, both of whom seemed very stupid, came to his camp and said something about Dr. Whitman being <B>dead, </B>but they were so stupid that he put but little confidence in what they told him.  The next day they went on eleven miles farther to Dry Creek, where they met quite a band of Indians, who corroborated what the two old Indians had tried to tell him.<br>
<br>
At that time the Americans were called "Bostons" and the English "King Georgemen." After a little talk one of the murderers, who had been in the background, bustled up to the front and asked Mr. Stanley if he was not a Boston.  Knowing what depended on his answer, he thought rapidly and replied p that he was a "Buckeye." Not knowing what <B>a </B>"Buckeye" was he dared <B>not </B>kill him and let him go.<br>

<br>
Mr. Stanley immediately took to the hills and by a roundabout way went down to old Fort Walla Walla, now called Wallula.  On his arrival one of the men, who had been present at the massacre and who had escaped with his family, came in to try to get some horses on which to bring his family to the Fort.  They were then hiding in the brush on their way down the Walla Walla River.<br>
<br>
Mr. Stanley let them have the horses he was using, which belonged to our mission, and Mr. Osborn returned for his family, which he then brought in to the Fort.<br>
<br>
Mr. Stanley learned as many of the details of the massacre as he could and wrote a long letter to our people describing what had occurred. This he sent by the Indian guide who had come with him, and whom we called Soloman, when he took the horses back to our place.<br>
<br>
Among my earliest recollections, which are very vivid. was his arrival at our home.  It was Saturday, and my father had gone away to spend the Sabbath at an Indian village seven or eight miles distant, and my mother and her two little boys were alone.  Mr. Walker's residence was a Short distance from ours.  In the afternoon we were visiting them.<br>
<br>
We children were having a great deal of fun and were very noisy. We were riding the stools which we called our horses, and packed other in imitation of our fathers when going on a  on a journey. We     were in the height of our fun when this Indian arrived.<br>
<br>
There was nothing unusual for an Indian to <B>come, </B>but this one brought a letter.  We  all  stopped  playing and gathered around Mr. Walker to hear the news.  He broke the seal and glanced at the page before taking in the full import of its contents.  His face blanched and he turned so pale that we all became frightened.<br>
<br>
He then read in trembling accents, how Dr. and Mrs. Whitman, Mr. Rodgers, another member of the mission, the two Sager boys, their adopted sons, and many other men had been killed by the Cayuse Indians, and that the women and children had been taken prisoners.<br>
It seemed as though a black cloud of horror settled down upon us.  Though too young to understand the full import of it all, we did understand enough to be very badly frightened.  Of the two families there was one courageous and one timid in each.  My father was a brave man, but my mother was very timid.  Mr. Walker was timid and Mrs. Walker was brave, but at that time was in a delicate condition of health, so that she too was unusually timid.<br>
<br>
My father being away, they were a very timid lot.  What should they do? Their dear friends had been killed by the very Indians they had come so far and sacrificed so much to help. If those Indians had killed them, why should not our Indians kill us? This day was
followed by a sleepless night for the older ones.<br>
<br>
The next day being Sunday, services were held as usual; but the Indians, never communicative, said but little.  Another night passed of horrid dreams and fearful foreboding.  Monday forenoon, my father returned.  He was a courageous man and his nerves were strong.  His presence revived the spirits of the others.  He understood enough of the circumstances to know there was no immediate danger.<br>
<br>
But it was a very serious situation.  Seventy miles to the north was Fort Colvile, where they knew they could move and be safe, if it was necessary.  Some were for pulling up stakes and going immediately.  They talked long and thought deeply.  At length, they concluded to advise with the Old Chief and several of the other leading Indians.  They were in their power, and it was better to show confidence than distrust.<br>
<br>
They all talked but the Old Chief, "Big Star." He was an old gray-haired man; his hair, falling down to his shoulders, had never been combed except by his fingers; his eyebrows were long, extending down over his eyes, and his finger nails, three-fourths of an inch long, were a sign of royalty, I suppose.  He said nothing until all the rest had talked, and then he made a speech, the substance of which was as follows:<br>
<br>
"My children, you are in trouble, your friends are dead and you are afraid that you will be killed also.  Do I have to tell you that I am your friend? Have we lived together all these many years and you do not know that our hearts are ones Believe me, the Spokane Indians will never kill their teachers.  Are you afraid of the Cayuses? They live a long way off.  Their country is warm, and ours is cold.<br>
<br>
"They will not want to come up here at this time of the year.  Besides they speak a different language from our people; and the other tribes, living between them and us, speak different languages from either of us.  All this makes it difficult for them to come here to do you harm.  Do you want to go to Fort Colvile? The weather is stormy, and your wives and little ones will have to sleep on the cold, wet ground.  Should it rain or snow they might catch cold, get sick and die.<br>
<br>
"You stay right here and we will protect you.  But you must be very careful; never go out alone and never after nightfall.  Prepare and Put up shutters for your doors and windows, so that no Indian can come along and shoot you with an arrow as you sit by the fireside.  Here you have warm homes, plenty of food and fire wood, also plenty of provender for your animals.<br>
<br>
"My young men will keep a sharp lookout to see if any strange Indians come about, and will report to me; and my men I can depend upon.  You stay here and we will protect you."
Our parents listened to his advice, accepted his counsel, and we all stayed there the following three months, all winter, alone among the Indians, with no other Americans within four or five hundred miles, nor any white people nearer than seventy miles; and we were perfectly safe.<br>
<br>
Immediately after the massacre, an express had been sent from Fort Walla Walla to Fort Vancouver.  Chief Factor Douglas, then in charge, at once sent Peter Skeen Ogden, one of the most dependable employes of the Company, to Walla Walla to rescue the women and children then held by the Indians as prisoners.<br>
<br>
With rare tact and good judgment he succeeded in inducing the Cayuse Indians to release all of the women and children held at the Whitman mission station, and also Mr. Spaulding and family then at Lapwai, who were brought down to the Fort under a guard of forty Nez Perce Indians.  By the last of December, 1847, all the Americans living east of the Cascade Mountains had been taken to the Willamette Valley except the -two families of Messrs.  Eells and Walker then living among the Spokane Indians, seventy miles from any other white people.<br>
<br>
Early in January, 1848, the provisional Governor of Oregon called for volunteers to go to Walla Walla and chastise the Indians who had committed the atrocious murders there.  A regiment readily responded and was organized at the Dalles.  Between there and Walla Walla on the Umatilla they met the Indians and <B>iii </B>one or two battles defeated them, then drove them east of their own country, across the Snake River and within sixty miles of our home.<br>
<br>
It was then that we prepared to go to Fort Colvile.  While our own band was friendly, other Indians in that part of the country might be induced to join the hostiles and do us harm.  I well remember when about the fourth of March we started out.  There was so much fear in the hearts of some of our parents that they felt very joyous in getting away.<br>
<br>
During the early part of the day the sun shone brightly; but soon the clouds came up,, it began to rain, and before night it turned into snow.  We went into camp, on the bank of a small stream, under the sheltering boughs of a large pine tree.  A large quantity of pitch pine was collected and one of the finest camp fires I ever saw was built.  The large snowflakes falling rapidly reflected against the black background of intense darkness and made a picture I shall never forget.<br>
<br>
By morning the snow was four inches deep.  But we cheerfully plodded<br>
on for two days more. We were fleeing from danger, and minded not the stormy weather.  On our arrival at Fort Colvile we were cordially welcomed by Chief Factor Lewes, then in charge, and made as comfortable as circumstances would permit.<br>

After we had been safely housed, Mr. Walker and my father returned to Tshimakain to put in the spring crops and await the progress of events.  Though I was but a little fellow not yet seven years old, my father took me with him as his companion.  Mr. Walker had for his companion a halfbreed young man.<br>
<br>
We arrived the latter part of the week and on the following Sabbath the usual services were held with that part of the band of Indians who were still there.  The old Chief and a part of the band were away on the other side of the Spokane River, some twenty-five miles distant.  About four o'clock in the afternoon, while we were sitting in our house reading, we heard a very unusual noise in the distance.<br>
<br>
My father went to the front door, opened it and listened; he then shut it quickly and fastened it.  We then went out into the back yard where we again listened.  This enclosure was a kind of small fort, made of palisades, set in the ground and extending seven or eight feet high and sharpened at the top to protect against Indians, dogs, and wild beasts.<br>
<br>
A table was standing in the yard, upon which we stood, so we could look over the fence and listen.  The noise came nearer and nearer and grew louder and louder.  There was no mistake; it was the Indian war whoop.  My hair seemed to be standing up under my cap, the cold chills ran down my back, and I trembled with fear.  'I kept saying, "Father, Father, what is it? What i it?"<br>
<br>
But he was too intent to answer me.  The prairie extended about half a mile from the house, and then came pine woods.  The Indians seemed about a mile away, in the forest.  At length they came in sight at the edge of the prairie.  They were riding on horses bareback, had their faces painted, feathers in their hair, were armed with guns, bows and arrows, and were howling and whoopiing constantly.  It was intensely thrilling.<br>
<br>
When they came plainly in view, however, my father recognized their horses as belonging to our own friend]y Indians, and his fears for our immediate safety were allayed.  But what it all meant, he could not tell.  After cutting about and making many circles on the prairie, and howling and yelling to their hearts' content, they formed a kind of half circle and made a dash for our houses, coming to Mr. Walker's first.<br>
<br>
Then all stopped with a sudden halt, and rent the air with an ear splitting shriek.  Mr. Walker was in his house with his half breed companion, and  <B>he </B>was frozen to his chair with terror.  He afterwards said that he could never forget how that war-whoop sounded in his ears-as if death by hostile Indians was at hand.<br>
<br>
My father and I went down to meet the Indians, he leading me by the hand; and being very much excited he walked so fast that I had to trot to keep up with him.  I said, "Father, what makes you walk so
fast?" But I received no reply.  The Indians, who were- our friends, were led by the old Chief's son.<br>
<br>
Their story was that early the previous day one of their people had heard a rumor that a band of Cayuse Indians were coming to kill us, and while hunting for his horses, had come across a trail that he suspected was theirs.  He then walked all that day and night and until noon the next day to tell the old Chief, that our lives were in danger.  The old Chief then said "Young men, catch your horses, run to Tshimakain and protect  your  teachers."<br>
<br>
This they had done; riding hard for twenty-five miles to save our lives, not knowing that the families had moved away.  They went out in the prairie and drove up our horses, put them under lock and key, and kept guard all night with fires burning; and the next day the whole company was our body guard, while we rode across the prairie on our way back to Fort Colvile.<br>
<br>
This they did so that if the enemy should be watching us from the hills, they would see that we were protected.  After we entered the timber one by one they dropped out and returned by different routes so that it would not be seen that they had left us.  Our guard thus gradually diminished as we traveled farther from the supposed danger, one or two only accompanying us clear to the Fort.<br>
<br>
For nearly three months after this, my father traveled continually with no white companion and much of the time entirely alone, visiting all the different bands of Indians in that whole country.  He obtained promises from them that they would maintain peace with the whites, these being solemnized by their laying their hands with him on his pocket testament which he carried.<br>
<br>
These promises were faithfully kept.  The particular band that we lived among were always true friends of the whites.  Being a man of peace, he never carried any arms.  He rode a horse that could outrun any Indian's horse in the country, and he had a mule that was as good as a watch dog.  It was his custom when traveling in dangerous sections of the country to stop about four o'clock. in the afternoon, make a fire, cook his supper, let his animals graze and just at dusk saddle up, and  ride  until after dark, when he would turn from the road at right angles, ride to some unfrequented spot, and there make a dry camp with no fire.<br>
<br>
He would stake out his trusty horse, hobble his mule, and lie down to sleep under some friendly bush.  No Indian could come anywhere near, that the old mule would not make it known.  During all this time that my father traveled the length and breadth of that section of the country, visiting all the Indians and keeping them from joining the hostiles, he was never molested.<br>
<br>
He kept an Indian, the Soloman before mentioned, carrying an express to and from Fort Colvile to Fort Walla Walla, and Fort Waters where the volunteers had their headquarters, and which was located on the
Whitman mission station.<br>
<br>
By this means he kept reliably informed of the movements of the soldiers, and was able to successfully contradict the lying rumors the hostile Indians were circulating to induce others to join them.  Soloman crossed the Columbia River at Fort Colvile, went down on the west side to opposite Fort Walla Walla, where he again crossed and then walked up twenty-five miles to Fort Waters.<br>
<br>
The first time he came to the Fort he walked unconcernedly right up towards the Fort.  The volunteers on guard had orders to shoot every Indian on sight; and seeing this one approaching, the guard leveled his gun, drew a bead on him, and was about to pull the trigger when the apparent innocency of the man caused him to desist.  After Soloman had delivered his letters, he was instructed to display a white flag thereafter when he came, which he was careful to do.<br>
<br>
The latter part of May, the volunteers determined to go back to the Willamette Valley.  They had driven the Cayuses out of their country, confiscated much of their stock, both horses and cattle, and could do but little more.  But there were still two American families up at Fort Colvile.  Should they all go back and leave them? The Colonel called up his men, stated the case, and asked who would volunteer to go up and escort them back to safety.  Maj.  Magone stepped forward and with him eighty others, who immediately started for the Colvile country.<br>
<br>
Sunday, May 28, the officers at the Fort invited both of our families to dinner.  Just as we were moving back from the table two messengers arrived, bringing letters from Maj.  Magone stating that he, with his company, would be at Tshim ' akain the next day to accompany our two families to Walla Walla.  The next morning at sunrise Mr. Walker, my father, and young Lewes, son of the Chief Factor, were on their horses bound for the meeting place.<br>
<br>
Just before sundown they had ridden seventy miles to their old home.  Most of the volunteers were already there.  They talked till mid-
night, and the next day at noon they started back to Fort Colvile, where they arrived Wednesday noon.  By Thursday noon we were all on our horses ready to bid good-bye to the upper country.<br>
<br>
By Saturday forenoon we rode for the last time up to the birthplace of most of us.  Naturally, we should have remained there over Sunday.  But our Indians were so fiercely friendly and objected so strenuously to our leaving them, that it was suspected they might run off our horses and hide them so we could not get away.  In the afternoon, therefore, we crossed the Spokane River so as to be out of their immediate range.<br>
<br>
While we were remaining there a few hours, and my mother,was sitting on a bale of goods, an old Indian came and sat down beside her.  He was a repulsive looking object; his face had no more expression than a piece of leather, his hair had never been combed, he wore a dirty buckskin shirt and an old greasy, dirty, lousy buffalo skin, but
little else.<br>
<br>
He said to her, "Our hearts cry because you are going away.  It will be all dark when our teachers are gone.  You do not need to go.  No one will hurt You.... Even if it is best for Mr. Walker with his many little children to go, you and Mr. Eells can stay.  He has a fast horse, no Indian can catch him.  And even if the Cayuses do come to kill you, I know where there is a hollow tree in the woods, and I will take you and your two little boys and cover you all up with my skin so no one can see you, and hide you there till they are gone."<br>
<br>
His earnest manner showed the sincerity of his words; but the idea of being covered up with that dirty, greasy, lousy skin made such an impression on my mother that I have often heard her laugh till the tears came into her eyes at the very idea.<br>
<br>
By the end of the following week, we arrived at Walla Walla where our friends had been massacred.  It was truly a dismal sight.  Our parents felt greatly grieved at the desolation.<br>
<br>
The following week we arrived at the Dalles.  There we separated.  My father took the horses across the Cascade Mountains, and Mr. Walker and the women and children went down the Columbia River in open boats.  We all had to walk across the portage at the Cascades, and the little children got very tired.  The next day we met a strong head wind, and while crossing the river were in great peril; but our lives were spared, for which our parents were very thankful.<br>
<br>
When we camped near Fort Vancouver the authorities there <B> gone</B> but provisions and also several pails of milk.  How good it looked to us, as we had not had any for a long time.  But when we tasted it, we began spitting it out, as it was very sour and we were bitterly disappointed.<br>
<br>
There we left our boats and took passage on a scow, which had paddle wheels on each side and was propelled by horse power, the animals walking on a tread machine.  When we passed what is now Portland there was but one good house standing there.  At Oregon City our long journey of more than three weeks was ended.<br>
<br>
This was the largest town we had ever seen.  Here were houses and streets such as we had never seen.  In a few days my father came in and reported that the horses had all safely crossed the mountains.  Arrangements were then made for Mr. Walker and his family to remain in Oregon City while my father and his family were to go about twenty-five miles south on the road to Salem, where was a creek called the Abaqua.  A man by the name of Samuel Allen gave us the use of a cabin his family had formerly lived in, while the range in the vicinity was good for our horses and mules.
By 1859 the hostilities of the Indians had ceased and the country east of the Cascade Mountains had been opened to settlement.  My father made a trip to Walla Walla during the summer vacation and made arrangements to purchase the old Whitman mission claim.  In the spring of 1860, my father and I left Forest Grove and went to Walla Walla.<br>
<br>
We had a small pair of horses, bought a new wagon and borrowed a yoke of oxen, and this made our team.  The horses, of course, were put ahead of the oxen.  From Portland to the Dalles we went by steamer.  It took us about a week to go to Walla Walla f rom the Dalles.<br>
<br>
On arriving at the old Whitman mission station it seemed a very unattractive place.  The grass, which had been dry, had been burned and the ground was all black.  There were no fences nor buildings except a little cabin about twelve or thirteen feet square with a dirt floor and a dirt roof. fireplace was on one side and the door was made of puncheons. The window was two panes of glass about eight by ten inches each.  Poles across one side of the room supported our bunk.  This was our abode for two summers and one winter.<br>
<br>
I had never been where I came in contact with wicked people before, but here nearly all the men I met drank, swore, and practiced all kinds of wickedness.  It was a new experience to me.<br>
<br>
As soon as our team was rested, we commenced breaking up ten acres of ground.  We had no grain f or our animals and they had to work on the bunch grass.  Consequently our days were short in which to plow.  When that was done, my father spent two days traveling over the valley to find some seed corn.  What he found was of all colors and we planted our ten acres.<br>
<br>
We then did what we could to put up a fence.  The kind of timber there was unfit, and our fence was very poor.  There were a great many old oxen that troubled us very much.  I remember one old ox in particular which we found in the field one morning.  We tied him up all day.  After supper I ran him off about ten miles and thought we had got rid of him, but the next morning as we looked down in the field there was that old brute eating our corn again.  We then tied him up a second time and spent all day riding in search of his owner.  He kindly put him in his team and drove him away.<br>
<br>
During all that season we did our own housekeeping, cooking on the fireplace and living in the rudest style.  My father preached on Sundays in various places in the valley from seven to fifteen miles distant.  Sometimes we went seven miles to the town of Walla Walla to church, which was then a very small village.  The year before, when my father first went there, there were only three houses in the town.  
A mile and a half from the town was the military Post which<br>
was well filled with soldiers. - Most were cavalry men.  In the fall we cut our crop.  It *as pretty tedious work, sitting all day long, husking corn all alone.  But we finally got it all put in a rail pen and covered with corn stalks.  We then sold it to the Quartermaster at the Fort for four and one-half cents a pound cob and all, and I had the job of hauling it up and delivering it, which I much enjoyed.<br>
<br>
Among the incidents that occurred during that summer was our experience with the mice.  They were very troublesome and grew so tame that they would run under the table and pick up the crumbs while we were eating our meals.  I finally started out to see if I could find a cat.  After riding two full days I found a little kitten that was just being weaned, purchased it for twenty-five cents, and took it home.<br>
<br>
Although it was too young to catch any mice, they all disappeared within two or three days just from hearing it mew.  It grew to be quite a cat, and being lonesome when it went away from the house it would follow me long distances all over the farm.  We became very much attached to it and it to us. We called it "Bits" as I had bought it for two bits."<br>
<br>
Late in the fall we locked up our cabin and prepared to return to our home at Forest Grove.  It had been the custom for all the white men to let their hair grow long just like the Indians.  I had done the same, as it covered up my neck and kept the sun from blistering it.  My father, being a minister, had to keep his hair short so as to look respectable.  I remember one time when he was called on to perform the marriage ceremony for two couples who were of the wealthiest families in the valley.<br>
<br>
His hair had grown very long and it was necessary to have it cut.  There were no barbers at hand; I had to do the job.  I had never done such a thing, but I took the scissors and did the best I could.  It was certainly shingled, as the ridges around the back of his head looked just like shingles on the roof of a house.  It answered the purpose, however, and he got $20.00 for his services.<br>
<br>
The oxen we had borrowed in the spring were sold and with our two horses we drove back to the Dalles.  There we left our wagon, crossed to the north side of the Columbia River, rode horseback down as far as the White Salmon River.  There we went on board the steamer which took us to the Cascades.<br>
<br>
From there we rode along the river to Fort Vancouver.  Here we took dinner with the Commanding Officer.  I always thought that his wife rather took pity on me for looking so much like a bear, for she was very kind.  Crossing the Columbia River there, we rode on to Portland where we met our friends, with whom we traveled out to Forest Grove.
As soon as we arrived home my mother, who was the family barber, got hold of her scissors and took off my long locks.  She also trimmed my father's hair, but it was noticed that his neck was badly sunburned while mine was as white as if I had been at home all summer.<br>

Whitman Massacre<br>
<br>
"Whitman Massacre and trial of the murderers," <B>Dictionary of Oregon History.</B> Portland:Binfords and Mort, 1956, p. 264-65.<br>
<br>
Distrust by the red natives of Oregon of the increasing numbers of white settlers entering the country in the middle 1840s, led to the treacherous murder by Cayuse braves on Nov. 29, 1847, of Dr. and Mrs. Marcus Whitman at their Waiilatpu mission on the Walla River.  Twelve others of their mission household were killed, and 53 women and children held captive for some weeks.<br>
<br>
Dr. Whitman was a practicing physician as well as a gospel missionary, and the fact that Indian immunity to all diseases was considerably less than with whites, with a higher red death rate, led to a belief among the natives that the white doctor was "bad medicine" and should be done away with.<br>
<br>
The massacre aroused the Oregon settlements to a fever pitch, and resulted in the Cayuse War and a measure of federal military protection for the Oregon Country. (C.  M. Drury, Marcus Whitman, Pioneer and Martyr; and any general history of Oregon and Washington.)<br>
<br>
The Whitman Murderers Trail<br>
<br>
This aftermath of the Whitman Massacre was held before the United States District Court, at Oregon City, May 23-25, 1850, with associate Justice Pratt presiding.  The United States of America, complainant, Chief Telokite, Tomahas, Clokomas, Isaashelucas and Kiamasumkin, belonging to the Cayuse Indian Nation, were defendants.  Amory Holbrook was counsel for the government; Thomas Claiborne for the defendants.<br>
<br>
The charge was first degree murder for the killing of Marcus Whitman and thirteen others at Waiilatpu Mission, Nov. 29, 1847.  The government introduced four witnesses, one of whom told of seeing Telokite kill Dr. Whitman.  Telokite was the only one of the quintet identified by the witnesses who saw the killings.<br>

Dr. John McLoughlin called by the defense, testified to warning Dr. Whitman against giving medicine to the Indians, as they killed their medicine men.  Stickas, Indian chief, testified to having warned Dr. Whitman he was in danger.  The defense offered to introduce testimony that it was the custom of the Cayuse Indian Nation to kill bad medicine men, but the court refused to permit such testimony.<br>
<br>
The defense contended there was no evidence that the crime was committed in Clackamas County as charged.  The court instructed the jury it was not necessary that the killings occurred in the place alleged in the indictment; that it was sufficient they occurred within the county (Clackamas) or within the jurisdiction of <B>the </B>court; and that the surrender by the Cayuse Nation of the defendants as the murderers (the Nation knowing best who the murderers were) could be used by the jury as evidence of the identity of the ac-
cused.<br>
<br>
On May 24, the jury returned a verdict of guilty; May 25, the five Indians sentenced to be hanged on June 3, 1850 in Oregon City.  The mandate of the court was executed by United States Marshal Joseph L. Meek.

WHITMAN MASSACRE.<br>
<br>
J.R. Gregg, "The Whitman Massacre," <B>A History of the Oregon Trail, Santa Fe Trail and Other Trails.</B> Portland: Binfords and Mort, 1955, p. 241-254.<br>
<br>
At the Waiilatpu Mission, Dr. Marcus Whitman had over two hundred acres of land under cultivation.  He had erected several large buildings and built a small grist-mill which was operated by water power.  On Mill Creek, about fourteen miles above the Mission, he had established a saw-mill, also operated by water power.<br>
<br>
The arrival of the first one hundred settlers overland in 1842 had aroused the suspicion of the Indians that the emigrants were coming to take their lands.  They blamed Dr. Whitman as <B>being </B>chiefly responsible for the immigration.  Whitman had been warned by Dr. McLaughlin of the attitude of the Indians and of their threatened attacks.<br>
<br>
The Cayuse Indians had personally threatened Dr. Whitman a number of
times.  They complained that Whitman had failed to pay them for the Mission land, although it had been generally understood that the land had been donated as an inducement to have the Mission estab-
lished among them.  It was the fearless determination on the part of Dr. Whitman that prompted him to remain, giving the Indians to understand that he had no fear of them.<br>
<br>
Scarcely had Dr. Whitman left on his journey east <B>in </B>the winter of 1842-3 than the Indians became more troublesome.  The grist mill was burned at Waiilatpu.  It has been said this fire was accidentally caused by Indians letting a nearby camp-fire get beyond their control.  It was also said the fire was of incendiary origin, and this has generally been accepted as a fact.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Whitman, with Rev.  P. H. Littlejohn and wife, were at the Mission at the time the mill burned.  Becoming alarmed they fled to the Methodist Mission at The Dalles, leaving a man named Geiger in charge at Waiilatpu.  Rev.  H. H. Spalding had also been threatened by Indians at the Lapwai Mission.<br>
<br>
When news reached Fort Vancouver of the burning of the mill at the Whitman Mission Dr. McLoughlin immediately informed Dr. White, the Indian agent, at Oregon City.  The newly, appointed Indian agent, accompanied by Thos.  McKay and Baptiste Dorion, left at once for the scene of the trouble.<br>
<br>
At The Dalles they were joined by Littlejohn and at Fort Walla Walla, McKinlay, the fur company agent, accompanied them to the Mission.  The Indians, after listening to the speeches of White, McKinlay and McKay, realized that the Englishmen and Americans would unite against them if they started serious trouble, so promised to keep the peace.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Whitman did not return to Waiilatpu until after her husband returned to her from his eastern trip.  She took the little daughters of Joe Meek and Jim Bridger with her when she fled to The Dalles.  Dr. Whitman rebuilt the mill.<br>
<br>
After Dr. Whitman returned from his unsuccessful meeting with the Presbyterian Board, in 1843, the Indians became more aggressive, and at times even very impudent, threatening Whitman with bodily harm.  It was evident he realized there would be serious trouble with the Indians if he remained at Waiilatpu. In 1846 he purchased the Methodist Mission at The Dalles all was preparing to abandon the Waiilatpu Mission at the time of the massacre and had been negotiating with the Catholics for the sale of the latter Mission.<br>
<br>
In the fall of 1847 measles broke out among the emigrants and<br>
spread to the Indians.  Dr. Whitman administered to the Indians, but they would not follow his instructions, and resorted to their own treatment which resulted in many deaths.  The Indian method of
<br>
treating diseases, accompanied by fever, was to strip off all the patient's clothes and have him take a sweat bath in a wigwam, then plunge into cold water.  In the case of measles this treatment, of course, would result in death instead of a cure.<br>
<br>
Joe Lewis, a degraded, designing half-breed, whom Dr. Whitman had befriended in many ways, instead of returning the kindness, incited the Indians to hostile acts.  At the time the doctor was on his eastern mission Lewis and other renegades circulated the false report among the Cayuses that Whitman had gone east to bring emigrants to settle among them and take their lands.<br>
<br>
When the epidemic of black measles broke out Lewis told the Indians that Dr. Whitman was poisoning them so that the emigrants could inherit their lands.  Like many of mixed blood, Lewis had inherited the bad traits of both races and none of the good qualities of either.<br>
<br>
Tamsuky, a Cayuse chief, and Joe Lewis continued in their efforts to incite the savages to violence.  Instickus, a friendly Umatilla Indian, much attached to Whitman, upon being informed of the impending danger, hastened to inform the doctor.  Whitman immediately commenced preparations to remove his Mission to The Dalles.<br>
<br>
Before this he had been preparing to move to The Dalles in the spring.<br>
<br>
On the morning of November 29, 1847, a large number of Tamsuky's followers gathered on a hill in the vicinity of the Mission.  While Dr. Whitman was busy in his study, about one o'clock in the afternoon, a number of Indians called for their usual request for medicine.  Dr. Whitman went to his medicine cabinet to supply their requests.<br>
<br>
While his back was turned for the moment he was treacherously struck in the back of the head with a hatchet by one of the savages, said to have been Tamachas.  After the doctor fell to the floor he was frightfully hacked in the face by Telauksit, another Indian, who had received many favors from Whitman.<br>
<br>
John Sager, one of the orphan emigrant children adopted by the Whitmans in 1844, was sick in bed in the room where Dr. Whitman was murdered.  The boy drew a pistol in a heroic attempt to avenge the death of his benefactor, but was hacked to pieces by the savages.  He wounded two of his assailants before being killed.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Whitman was attacked by the savages in the dwelling and was severely wounded.  With Rogers, Dr. Whitman's assistant, and some of
the others she took refuge in one of the upper rooms, where they prepared to defend themselves.  Tam<B>suky, an Indian who had received many favors from the mission</B>aries, on a pretense of friendship persuaded them to leave the room as the savages intended to set fire to the building.<br>
<br>
As Mrs. Whitman entered the Mission house, where the frightened women and children were assembled, she fainted upon seeing the mangled form of her husband.  As Rogers and one of the women, Mrs. Hayes, was attempting to carry her between the two buildings they were surrounded and fired on by the savages.  Mrs. Whitman and Rogers were both fatally wounded and Mrs. Whitman never regained consciousness.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Whitman was the only woman murdered.  The other women and older girls were outraged and with the smaller girls and boys were held captives until ransomed by Peter Skeen Ogden, of the Hudson Bay Company, about a month later.<br>
<br>
Besides Dr. and Mrs. Whitman eleven others were murdered.  They were Rev.  Rogers, L. W. Sanders, Isaac Gilliland, Kimball, Hoffman, Sales, Marsh, James <B>Young,</B>' Crockett Brewley, John and Frances Sager.  Crockett Brewley and his sixteen-year-old sister, Lorinda, were both sick with measles.  Mary Bridger and Helen Meek were also sick with measles.<br>
<br>
All the immigrants of 1847 had passed on to the Willamette Valley, with the exception of a few who had been employed by Dr. Whitman to work at the Mission, and a few others, because of illness, and some others who had decided to stay on account of the lateness of the season.  There were sixty-eight persons at the Mission at the time of the massacre.<br>
<br>
Fifteen of them belonged at the Mission and fifty-four were emigrants.  Besides Dr. and Mrs. Whitman, the other fourteen belonging at the Mission were Rev.  Rogers, a young man who was assistant missionary; Eliza Spalding, daughter of Rev.  H. H. and Mrs. Eliza Spalding, who was attending the Mission school; the seven orphaned Sager children, adopted by the Whitman's in 1844; Lorinda and Crockett Brewley, also adopted by the Whitmans; Mary Bridger and Helen Meek, who were attending school at the Mission, and two sons of Donald Munson who were also attending school there.<br>
<br>
The fifty-four emigrants were: Isaac Gilliland, an aged man without family; Joseph Smith, wife and five children; L. Woodbury Sanders, wife and five children; Wm.  D. Canfield, wife and five children; Mr. Kimball, wife and five children; Josiah Osborne, wife and three, children; Elan Young, wife and three sons; Mrs. Rebecca Hayes and young son; Shepard Marsh and eleven year old daughter; a Mr.
Hoffman, a Mr. Sayles, and a Mr. Hall, his wife and four children.<br>
<br>
Some of the men working about the Mission managed to secrete themselves at various places until night came and then escaped in the darkness.  From among the emigrants stopping at the<br>
mission for the Winter Dr. Whitman employed Isaac Gilliland, a tailor; L.W. Sanders, as a teacher; a man named Kimball as a farmer; Joseph Smith and Elam Young to run the grist mill.<br>
<br>
All the men found at the Mission were killed by the savages except Joseph Smith and Elam Young, Who were spared to grind flour for the Indians.  Joseph Osborne, wife and children, who were in a bed room at the time the attack began, escaped by removing the floor boards and secreting themselves under the house until dark, then made their escape to Fort Walla Walla.<br>
<br>
A man named Hall was the first to escape and reach the fort.  He went on from there in an attempt to carry the news of the massacre to the Willamette Valley.  Hall traveled along the north bank of the Columbia River to about opposite the mouth of the Des Chutes River, where he was drowned in attempting to cross the Columbia in a canoe.<br>
<br>
Another of the emigrants, Wm.  D. Canfield, succeeded in escaping after being wounded in the hip.  The massacre occurred on Monday and Canfield reached the Lapwai Mission the following Saturday.<br>
<br>
Among the thirty-six captives held for ransom by the savages were the following Mission children: Lorinda Brewley, sixteen years old; Eliza Spalding, eleven; Mary Bridger, thirteen; Catherine Sager, thirteen; Elizabeth Sager, ten; Martha Sager, eight; Henrietta Sager, four; Hannah Sager and Helen Meek, eight.<br>
<br>
The emigrant men, women and children held captive were: From Du Page County, Illinois-Joseph Smith and his wife, Hannah Smith, and their five children, Mary Smith, age fifteen years; Edwin Smith, thirteen; Chas.  Smith, eleven; Nelson Smith, six; Mortimer Smith, four.<br>
<br>
From Fulton County, Illinois-Mrs.  Eliza Hall; Jane Hall, age ten; Mary Hall, eight; Ann Hall, six; Rebecca Hall, three; Rachel Hall, one year.  Mr. Hall, the husband and father, was drowned in the Columbia River while seeking aid to rescue the captives.<br>
<br>
From Osage County, Mississippi-Elam Young, Mrs. Iren Young, Daniel Young, twenty-one; John Young, nineteen.  Elam Young's third son, James Young, was killed in the massacre.<br>
<br>
From La Porte County, Indiana-Mrs.  Harriet Kimball, Susan M.  Kimball, age sixteen; Nathan Kimball, thirteen; Byron Kimball, eight; Sarah M. Kimball, six; Mince A. Kimball, one.  Mr. Kimball
was one of the victims of the massacre.<br>
<br>
From Oskaloosa, Iowa, Mrs. Sally Canfield, Ellen Canfield, sixteen; Oscar Canfield, nine; Clarissa Canfield, seven; Sylva Canfield, five; Albert Canfield, three.  Mrs. Sanders, Helen M. Sanders, fourteen; Phoebe Sanders, ten; Alfred Sanders, six; Nancy Sanders, four; Mary Sanders, two.  W. D. Canfield escaped and was later reunited with his family.  Sanders was among those murdered.<br>
<br>
From Illinois-Mrs.  Rebecca Hayes and son Henry, age four years.<br>
At the time of the massacre <B>William  </B>McBean was in charge of the Hudson Bay Company post at Fort Walla Walla.  As soon as the terrible tragedy was reported to him he immediately dispatched a courier to Fort Vancouver to notify James Douglas, chief factor of the company.<br>
<br>
The messenger reached Vancouver December 7th, five days after the massacre.  Douglas at once informed Governor Abernethy, the messenger arrived at Oregon City, December 6th. Abernethy immediately called the legislature in session and issued a call for volunteers to go to the Walla Walla Valley to rescue tlie captives.<br>
<br>
Three days after the news of the massacre reached Fort Vancouver, on December 7th, Douglas dispatched Peter Skeen Ogden, second in command at Vancouver of the Hudson Bay Company, with a force of men to Fort Walla Walla and the scene of the massacre.  Ogden, on arriving at the Dalles, advised the Americans there to abandon the Methodist Mission and seek safety in the Willamette Valley.<br>
<br>
The missionaries there complied with his advice while Ogden with his men hurried on to Fort Walla Avalla to take steps to rescue the captives from the Indians.<br>
<br>
In the meantime a company of American volunteers was being organized in the Willamette Valley to be sent to The Dalles as an outpost to prevent the Indians from invading the lower settlements.  The volunteers arrived at Fort Vancouver on December 10th and went on to The Dalles, where they arrived December 21st.  The legislature pledged the provisional government to pay the expenses of the campaign against the Indians.<br>
<br>
Many citizens responded with subscription of funds.  Steps were taken to enlist a large force of men.<br>
<br>
Ogden reached Fort Walla Walla on December 29th and immediately took steps to rescue the captives.  He called a council of the chiefs at the Catholic Mission on the Umatilla River just above the present town of Pendleton.  Four of the chiefs, Tilokaikt, Champaspelo, Tawatowe and Ascheka, signed a petition, which in substance,
requested the Americans not to go to war against the Cayuses.<br>
<br>
It also stated that the Indians would be willing to forget the murder of the son of the great chief of the Walla Wallas, Peupeumoxmox, that had occurred in California a number of years before, if the Americans would forget about the Whitman massacre.  They also requested that "two or three great men" of the Americans come to their country to conclude a treaty of peace.<br>
<br>
They said that as soon as the peace treaty was concluded they would release the women and children <B>they were holding </B>prisoner and gave assurance that they would not harm the captives before the arrival of "the two or three great men." They concluded by asking that the American emigrants should no longer travel through their country.<br>
<br>
The date and place of the signing of the document given as "Place of Tawatowe, Youmatilla, twentieth of December, 1847." The council was held at the village of Chief Tawatowe.<br>
<br>
The Indian referred to by the four chiefs as being killed in California by white men, and alleged by them as being the cause of the Whitman massacre, had occurred a number of years before.  He was an educated Indian, Elijah Nedding, named for a prominent Methodist Bishop, residing in New York.<br>
<br>
He was a son of the noted Walla Walla chief, Peupeumoxmox, or Yellow Serpent.  He had accompanied his father, who had headed a number of their tribe on a trip to California, where they went to exchange their furs and horses for cows with the settlers.  The Indians were well received at Fort Sutter and a satisfactory trade was con-
summated.  Later a difficulty arose between the young chief and a white man, in which Hedding was tlie aggressor, and in which lie was killed.<br>
<br>
In retaliation for the death of the chief the Indians had threatened to attack Oregon settlers in the Willamette Valley.  The Indian agent, Dr. White, had succeeded in pacifying the redskins by promising them presents as recompense for the death of the young chief.  But soon afterward White went east and later resigned without fulfilling his promise.<br>
<br>
Another excuse advanced by the chiefs for the massacre was that it was an act of retaliation for the death of a Nez Perce chief who had been killed by Sioux Indians when he was accompanying the mis-
sionary, W. H. Gray, on an eastern trip.  They presented the ar-
gument that those the Cayuse Indians had murdered at the Whitman Mission evened the score for the killing of the young Walla Walla chief in California by a white man and the killing of the Nez Perce chief by the Sioux.<br>
<br>
They contended this was a reasonable compensation, although one of the Indians had been killed by other Indians, and Americans should now be satisfied and sign a treaty of friendship with tlie Cayuse-
The Cayuses would also forget the deaths of the two Indians killed several years previously, although neither of these dead Indians were members of the Cayuse tribe.  Besides their dastardly murder of thirteen innocent white people the Cayuses were' holding thirty-six others as hostages.<br>
<br>
One cannot help but note the similarity of the mentality of these benighted savages with that of the brutal Nazi German savages in exacting the frightfully heavy toll of from fifty to two hundred innocent <B>hostages for</B> the justifiable killing of a petty German officer.  'These inexcusable crimes among barbarians  from the lowbrow inhuman Stalin and the Austrian paper hanger to the ignorant savages of the Columbia River Basin, are so  similar no further comment is necessary.<br>
<br>
Because of  Peter  Skeen  Ogden's  ability  in  dealing  with   Indians and the confidence they had in him he was chosen by James Douglas, head of the Hudson Bay Company, to negotiate<br>
for the release of the captives.  It was Ogden's object to prevent further murders and secure release of the prisoners before the savages became aware American troops were being sent into their country.  He arrived at Walla Walla on the evening of December 19th and immediately called a council of the Indians to determine their intentions toward the captives.<br>
<br>
On December 23rd, at Ogden's request, following the meeting with the four chiefs on the Umatilla River, they again assembled at Fort Walla Walla for another pow-wow.  In an address to the chiefs Ogden reminded them that members of his company had been among them for thirty years, during which time there had been no bloodshed <B>until </B>this inhuman massacre, and added: "We are traders, and a different nation from the Americans. But recollect we supply  you with ammunition, but not to kill Americans.  They are the same color as ourselves and speak the same language."<br>
<br>
He severely reprimanded the chiefs and blamed them for permitting the outrage.  Ogden pleaded that if they would deliver the captives so he could turn them over to their friends he would pay them a ransom.  Ogden was married to an Indian woman.<br>
<br>
Three of the chiefs replied to Ogden  They were Tawatue, a young chief, who consented to give up the captives, but asked that the old chief, Teloquit, be heard.  The old chief, replied to Ogden, saying, "I have listened to your words.  Young men do not forget them.  We know the whites to be our best friends, who all along have prevented us from killing each other.  This is why we avoid getting into war with them.<br>
<br>
"Besides the ties of blood, the whites have shown us a convincing proof of their attachment to us by burying their dead long side of
ours.  Chief, your words are weighty.  Your hairs are gray. We have known you a long time.  You have had an unpleasant trip to this place.  I cannot, therefore, keep the families back.  I make them over to you, which I would not do to another younger than yourself."<br>
<br>
Peupeumoxmox then made a brief speech, giving his consent for the captives to be turned over to Ogden.<br>
<br>
Ogden then addressed two chiefs of the Nez Perce tribe on behalf of Rev.  H. H. Spalding who was being held captive with others at the Lapwai Mission.  Besides Rev. and Mrs. Spalding and their three children were Mr. Hart, brother of Mrs. Spalding; Miss Jonson, Mr. Jackson, and Wm.  Craig.  Craig will be remembered as one of the mountaineers, and a companion of Joe Meek, who came to Oregon in 1840.<br>
<br>
He was a Nez Perce Indian agent and interpreter and was married to a Nez Perce squaw.  The two Nez Perce chiefs promised to bring the Americans from the Lapwai Mission, where they were held prisoners by the Nez Perces if they would come, and immediately left with a letter from Ogden to Spalding.<br>
<br>
On December 29, 1847, upon Ogden paying to the Cayuses sixty-two blankets, sixty-three cotton shirts, twelve handkerchiefs ten guns, six hundred rounds of ammunition, twelve flints and thirty-seven pounds of tobacco, the Indians turned over the thirty-six prisoners they had taken captive at the Whitman Mission.<br>
<br>
Seven head of oxen and sixteen bags of coarse flour, obtained from Chief Taloukait, for the use of the captives, also had to be accounted for, according to the Oregon Spectator of <B>January</B> 20, 1848.  On New Year Day, 1848, Rev.  Spalding, with ten other Americans, arrived at Fort Walla Walla from Lapwai under escort of fifty Nez Perce Indians.<br>
<br>
For their safe delivery Ogden paid the Nez Perces twelve blankets, twelve shirts, twenty handkerchiefs, four fathoms of tobacco, two hundred rounds of ammunition and some knives.<br>
<br>
Three days later, Ogden with the sixteen men who had accompanied him from Fort Vancouver, started with the released captives by boat back to Fort Vancouver.  Shortly after they left Fort Walla Walla fifty armed Cayuses dashed up to the fort and demanded that Spalding be released to them so they could kill him.<br>
<br>
They had just heard of the arrival of the American volunteers at The Dalles and placed the blame for this on the missionary.  Ogden had left the fort with the prisoners just in the nick of time.<br>
<br>
Those who had fled from The Dalles, on advice of Ogden, were Perrin
Whitman, Dr. Henry Staffarans, Wm.  McKinney and wife, Alanson Hinman, wife and child.  Perrin Whitman was looking after The Dalles Mission, which his uncle, Dr. Marcus Whitman had acquired.  The others were among late emigrant arrivals from the east.  The Indians had already committed hostile acts before the white residents departed for the Willamette Valley.<br>
<br>
Ogden arrived with the survivors of the massacre at Fort Vancouver on January 8, 1848.  Besides the survivors of the massacre were Rev.  H. H. Spalding and the others from the Lapwai Mission.  Also accompanying them was a distinguished artist of that day J. M. Stanley, who had been following his vocation in the vicinity of the Clearwater.<br>
<br>
Stanley was famous for his painting of Indian characters. Upon the arrival of Ogden and his party at Fort Vancouver a messenger was dispatched to Oregon City to appraise Governor Abernathy of the safe arrival of the released captives at the British trading post.<br>
<br>
Two days later they were taken to Oregon City by boat.  Wm.  Craig and family, Father Brouillet and another Catholic priest from the Mission on the Umatilla River later went to Oregon City.<br>
<br>
The Nez Perces, Spokanes and Umatillas remained friendly and protected the missionaries at Lapwai on the Clearwater and Techimakian on the Spokane River.  Revs.  Eells and Walker, with their families, were at the latter Mission.  The Spokane Indians declared they would protect the missionaries at this Mission with their lives.  Rev.  Brouillet and other Catholic missionaries were British subjects and the Catholic Mission on the Umatilla River was not disturbed.<br>
<br>
Several causes have been attributed for the Whitman massacre by the missionaries and settlers of that period; among which was the growing opposition of the Indians to immigration.  In this, it has been charged they were encouraged by renegades and half-breeds.<br>
Preparations were speedily made by the colonists to punish the perpetrators of the dastardly outrage.  Cornelius Gilliam was chosen colonel of the regiment of volunteers that had recently been organized.  The volunteers assembled at The Dalles.<br>
<br>
On February 22, 1848, they left The Dalles for the Indian country.  Several skirmishes occurred on the way and a battle was fought<br>
at Sand Hollow, near the Umatilla River on February 24th.  The Indians had fortified themselves in a depression that formed natural rifle pits.  The Volunteers formed their battle line with Captain Lawrence Hall's command in the center, protecting the wagon supply train, Captain H. J. G. Maxon and Captain Philip Thompson's companies were on the north side of the road, forming the left flank.<br>

The right flank on the south side of the road, was commanded by Captain Levi English and Captain Thomas McKay.  McKay commanded a company of French-Canadians he had organized on French Prairie.  Two of his brothers, First Lieutenant Charles McKay and Second Lieutenant Alexander McKay, were members of his company.  Baptiste Dorion was a sergeant in the company.<br>
<br>
The Indians made their first charge against the command of Captain Thomas McKay, on the extreme right.  The attacking braves were Cayuses, Walla Wallas and Umatillas.  The hostilities of the Indians, it was said, was not so much to protect the perpetrators of the massacre, but to prevent the invasion of their country by white settlers They feared punishment might be meted out to the innocent as well as the guilty.<br>
<br>
The Indians were under command of Five Crows. General chief of the tribes, and War Eagle, both Cayuses.  Both chiefs had boasted to their followers that they were great medicine men and that they could prevent the white warriors from reaching the Umatilla River.<br>
<br>
Five Crows had declared he was immune to the white men's bullets.  War Eagle had made even a greater boast, by declaring he was not only invulnerable to bullets, but that he could catch them between his teeth and swallow them.<br>
<br>
The troops had been ordered by Colonel Gilliam not to fire on the Indians first, as he was desirous of avoiding hostilities if the redmen would peacefully surrender the murderers of Dr. Whitman and the other victims of the massacre.  As the troops approached the Umatilla River, Five Crows and War Eagle came out from under cover, galloping on their war ponies toward the troops.<br>
<br>
They shot a small dog belonging to one of the soldiers, that had dashed out toward them barking.  Captain Thomas McKay, although part Indian himself, had felt bitter hatred for the red race since boyhood on account of the murder of his father on the Tonquin.<br>
<br>
As the charging chiefs dashed boldly toward his command gallant Captain McKay shot and killed War Eagle.  His brother, First Lieutenant Charles McKay, shot and shattered the arm of Five Crows, wounding him so severely that he was forced to give up his command and retire from tlie conflict.  Five Crows later died from the effects of this wound.<br>
<br>
Discouraged and no longer deluded by the extravagant claims of their two chiefs of immunity from tlie white man's bullets, they managed to keep up a strong resistance until evening and in the night withdrew from the conflict.  Eleven soldiers were wounded in the battle.  The Indian's losses were greater, but as usual, they
carried off most of their dead and all of their wounded, and their exact casualties are unknown.<br>
<br>
The next day the troops resumed their march toward the Whitman Mission, where they arrived on the third day, March 2, 1848, a little over three months after the massacre, and camped nearby.  Colonel Gilliam, with two companies, visited the scene of the massacre and remained several days, during which time they gave a Christian burial to the thirteen victims murdered by the Indians.<br>
<br>
The bodies had previously been buried in shallow graves, at the time Ogden ransomed the captives, but some of the bodies had been partly exhumed by coyotes.  All were given better burial by the troops.<br>
<br>
All of the buildings had been burned by the savages.  Wagons and all other farm implements had been thrown into the flames and consumed.  Even the orchard had been cut down.  Col.  Gilliam converted the walls of the ruined Mission into a fort, which was named Fort Waters for Lieut.  Col.  James Waters, second in command.  He was the<br>
same Waters who so generously befriended stranded emigrants  that arrived in 1844-5.<br>
<br>
One of the Catholic priests, Father Brouillet, was said to have been on his way from the Umatilla Mission to the Whitman Mission to negotiate for the purchase of Dr. Whitman's property at Waiilatpu Mission when appraised of the massacre.  Brouillett said he went on to the Whitman Mission the next day and assisted a half-breed Indian boy, Joseph Stanfield, who was preparing to bury the victims of the tragedy.<br>
<br>
Dr. and Mrs. Whitman were buried together in one grave and all the others were buried in a large excavation, then pailings placed around the graves.  When the soldiers arrived on the scene about three months later both graves had been dug into by wolves and some of the bodies disinterred.  The volunteers gathered up the remains and all were reinterred in a single grave.  The site is now marked by a monument.<br>
<br>
A tress of Mrs. Whitman's golden hair, it is said, was preserved among the pioneer relics in the Oregon archives at Salem.  It is also claimed that the hatchet used by Tamahas in the slaying of Dr. Whitman was given by this savage to Stock Whitley, a chief of the Des Chutes tribe, just before Tamahas was executed.<br>
<br>
After the death of Whitley his family gave the tomahawk to Donald McKay, the Indian interpreter and son of Thomas  McKay who is said to have presented the weapon to William Logan, Indian agent at the Warm Springs Agency in 1864.  Bancroft appears to have doubted this story.<br>
<br>
He says: "Another and more probable story is that Tamahas used a hatchet obtained by Tiliquoit of the Gros Ventres in 1833, and that
he presented it to Five Crows a few years later." Bancroft also says: "It is not probable, however, that Tamahas would give a keepsake to a Des Chutes chief when the tribe had refused to assist the guilty Cayuses."<br>
<br>
Tamahas was in the vicinity of Whitley's band when captured.  After the battle of Sand Hollow the Indians, pursued by some of the soldiers, retreating from the Umatilla Valley to Snake River.  One band of Indians was surprised and captured on Touchet Creek.  Among them it was later learned were some of the murderers.  These Indians worked a ruse by professing great friendship, claiming the hostiles had left their horses and crossed Snake River.<br>
<br>
Collecting the horses and permitting the Indians to go free, the troops were unexpectedly attacked by the savages and compelled to retreat.  In the battle one of the volunteers Wm. Taylor, was killed.  But his death was avenged by Nathan Olney, who killed the assailant in a hand to hand duel with knives.  Olney was afterward Indian agent at the Umatilla reservation.<br>
<br>
The Indians  showed  no  further  desire  to  give   battle   and scattered in all directions. Tamsukie, said to have been the slayer of Dr. Whitman, fled with his band to the John Day River.  In 1850 a band of Umatilla Indians attempted to capture Tamsukie.  In a battle that ensued Tamsukie was killed and a number of his followers captured,<br>
<br>
Of these five captives, all were hanged at Oregon City on 'June 30, 1850, for participation in tlie Whitman massacre.  The five hanged were Kilokite, Qtiiahi-narsum (Panther Skin), Kloakmus, Siahsaltichus (Wet Wolf), and Tamahas.  All five of these Indians denied their guilt at the time of their execution.  They claimed that ten Indians had participated in the murders, but declared the guilty ones had all since died; some having been killed by white men and some by Indians.<br>
<br>
Kilokite admitted that two of his sons-that had later died-took part in the massacre, but denied his own participation.  Panther Skin declared that he was away at the time of the attack, being up the river, and that he knew nothing of the plot and took no part in it.  His story is generally believed.<br>
<br>
Tamahas did not protest his innocence as strongly as the others.  After the execution other Cayuses admitted Tamsukie was guilty of the crime and that he was the one who had slain Dr. Whitman.  They claimed that the others who were hanged were innocent, and further stated that all the others who had participated in the murders had died or been killed before the execution took place.<br>
<br>
Their statements were generally accepted as true.  The five Cayuses hanged embraced the Catholic religion and a priest attended them at the time of the execution.<br>

The legislature-following the massacre-named Joel Palmer Indian agent and appointed Palmer, Major H. A. G. Lee and Robert Newell to visit the Nez Perces and other tribes for the purpose of persuading them from joining the Cayuses.  At the time the volunteers were in pursuit of the Cayuses, Colonel Gilliam made a proposal to the Indians that if they would deliver Joe Lewis, the renegade, to him, be would release five of the Indians guilty of the massacre.<br>
<br>
But two of the commissioners, Joel Palmer and Robert Newell, who had been appointed to treat with the Indians, would not consent to the proposal.  Sticcas, a friendly Cayuse chief, is said to have attempted to deliver Joe Lewis, together with some stolen property the chief was attempting to bring to the volunteers.  But he was overtaken and overpowered by other Indians who rescued Lewis and took possession of the stolen property which they carried away.<br>
<br>
Lewis, accompanied by seven of the Indians implicated in the massacre, fled across the mountains to the vicinity of Fort Hall on upper Snake River.  A battle is said to have occurred between them and some Shoshone Indians on the Boise River and two of the<br>
Cayuses were killed.<br>
<br>
The final fate of Joe Lewis is shrouded in mystery, unless the dying confession of the half-breed Indian-Negro renegade, Star Wilkerson, is true.  Wilkerson, known as "Bigfoot," said Lewis was killed on the Payette River at the crossing of the old Boise-Auburn express road, about twelve miles above the present town of Payette, Idaho, in 1862.<br>
<br>
According to Wilkerson, he and Lewis were attempting to steal an expressman's horses, who was camped on the opposite side of the river.  The expressman, hearing a noise but unable to see the thieves, fired a shotgun across the river.  Lewis and Wilkerson were both wounded, Lewis quite severely.  Wilkerson tried to carry Lewis away but he soon died and Wilkerson buried his body in the sand in the Payette River bottom, not far from the road.  The body was never found and Wilkerson, who was slightly wounded, says the expressman never knew he killed Lewis.<br>
<br>
The Indian outbreak, following the Whitman massacre, was the first serious Indian war in Oregon and is known as the Cayuse War.  Cornelius Gilliam, who led the volunteers, was accidentally killed while returning to the Willamette Valley with a supply train for provisions and to consult with the governor.  The accident occurred as Col.  Gilliam was attempting to get a rope from the rear of one of the wagons to picket his horse.  The rope became entangled, causing the discharge of a gun that was lying in the wagon-bed.<br>
<br>
Capt.  McKay and Capt.Maxon with one hundred and fifty men were accompanying the wagon train to The Dalles for the supplies.  Col.  Gilliam had proved himself a gallant and capable officer.  His death was universally mourned.  After the death of Col.  Gilliam the
command was taken over by Lieut.  Col.  James Waters.  The Cayuse war soon came to a close without any further serious battles.<br>

WHITMAN MASSACRE.<br>
<br>
Nancy Wilson Ross,"Murder at the place of the Rye Grass," <B>The American Heritage Book of Great Adventures of the Old West.</B> Compiled by the editors of American Heritage... New York:American Heritage Press, 1973, p. 149-169.<br>
<br>
In July of the year 1847,  only four months before their murder at the hands of the Indians  they had crossed the American continent to Christianize, Dr. Marcus Whitman and his high-minded, high-spirited wife, Narcissa, entertained a wandering Canadian artist at their little mission in the wilds of the Oregon territory, just west of present-day Walla, Washington.<br>
<br>
The artist was a painter from Toronto named Paul Kane, who aspired-like the American George Catlin-to leave a record of Indian physiological types and Indian ways of life before alcohol, gunpowder, white men's diseases, and white men's customs forever altered them.<br>
<br>
It was through this chance visit that portraits have been preserved of the two men who killed Marcus Whitman, and incited their fellow tribesmen to the heartless massacre of his wife and other innocent residents in the lonely settlement at Waiilatpu, "the place of rye grass.<br>
<br>
In Kane's journal, Wanderings of an Artist, we learn that it was Whitman himself who suggested the Cayuse braves, Tilaukait and Tamahas, as subjects for the artist's sketch book.  Few uglier or more ominous visages were ever put on canvas.  Certainly Kane, in his years of wandering among primitive tribes, painted no other portraits of aborigines that convey quite the same expression of brooding cruelty.<br>
<br>
Their long black hair, parted in the middle and hanging lankly down over naked shoulders, frames high, protuberant cheekbones, narrow, suspicious eyes, outjutting chins, and mouths shut in a tight, vicious line.  Both Indians look exactly what they proved to be-in  spite of all the Whitmans' long-enduring optimism-dangerous,    confused, and irrationally violent men.<br>

The Whitmans' long journey to their tragic fate had begun back in the year 1834, when a persuasive Congregational pastor named Samuel Parker came riding through the back roads of western New York State with an inspiring message about far distant red men and their fervent wish to be saved.  Marcus Whitman, 32 years of age, a doctor in the village of Wheeler, heard Dr. Parker's appeal and was fired by it.  So also was Narcissa Prentiss of Amity, an unusually gifted and attractive woman not yet married - mysteriously enough - though 26 years old.<br>
<br>
Narcissa, the daughter of Stephen Prentiss, an eminent judge and house builder, had been fired to "go to the heathen" as early as her sixteenth year.  Perhaps it was her dream of missionary life that had kept her single until she was 26, an advanced age that in those times classified her as a spinster.<br>
<br>
Apparently, however, there was little that was spinsterish about her.  Friends have left descriptions in glowing terms.  She had golden hair and a golden voice, "sweet and musical as a chime of bells." She was also "symmetrically formed, very graceful in her voice and carriage," and the possessor of a "brilliant sparkling eye-peculiarly so when engaged in animated conversation."<br>
<br>
In addition to these attributes, she had received an exceptional education for a girl of her day and, as a school-teacher herself, had the ability and audacity to give a class in "natural philosophy"-which we know today as physics -and even to attempt the teaching of chemistry.<br>
<br>
That such a formidable array of charms and talents should be sacrificed in some rough, dangerous, and remote outpost of the Lord's vineyard did not seem as tragic to her friends and family<br>
as it did to some of the worldly gentlemen she was later to meet, for a great wave of Christian conversion was then sweeping rural America.<br>
<br>
There was no shame attached to rising, flooded with tears, in a respectable congregation and crying out <B>in </B>anguish of spirit, "What shall I do to be saved?" Narcissa had been "saved" at the age of eleven, and after she heard the Reverend Dr. Parker's inspirational appeal in the spring of 1834, she had made her first formal try at becoming a missionary.<br>
<br>
Among Parker's papers is a letter to the mission board asking, "Are females wanted? A Miss Narcissa Prentiss of Amity is very anxious to go to the heathen.  Her education is good - piety conspicuous. . . ."<br>
<br>
To Dr. Parker's cautious question the board replied with a polite but firm No. Female missionary teachers could not, it was believed,
be "employed tactfully except at boarding schools." Narcissa's only chance lay, therefore, in the unlikely event that she would find a husband with the same burning zeal to go west and with qualifications as exceptional as her own.  By a most extraordinary turn of fate just such a young man appeared.<br>
<br>
Marcus Whitman too was well past the usual marrying age.  He had to make his way alone against frequent financial difficulties and recurrent bouts of ill health-a combination of misfortunes that also accounted for his being a doctor not of divinity but of medicine, a status considerably lower in the prevailing social scale of the period.<br>
<br>
Marcus was not even a Reverend.  He had, to his deep regret, been unable to finance the seven years required for earning a minister's  degree,  though  he  had   fulfilled more than the usual period of training then expected of doctors.<br>
<br>
While the special circumstances surrounding the fateful meeting of Narcissa Prentiss and Marcus Whitman are not known, it can be assumed that the persuasive Dr. Parker had a hand in the romance.  As soon as their troth was plighted, Marcus-over Narcissa's protests, for she wanted to be married at once and accompany him-set off with Parker on an exploratory trip to the western side of the Rockies.<br>
<br>
But he cut short his journey and came back to claim his bride long before he was expected, bringing with him two Indian boys picked up at the mountain rendezvous of the fur companies, as living proof of the red man's need for salvation.  And so on a day in February, 1836-almost two years after Parker's first stirring "Macedonian appeals"-Narcissa and Marcus stood up together in the little church at Angelica, New York where the Prentisses were then living, and made     their solemn marriage vows.<br>
<br>
Certain details of the ceremony lend themselves to a macabre and prophetic symbolism.  All Narcissa's female relatives were garbed in black, and even the bride had chosen black bombazine, the hue and material of formal mourning, for her wedding dress.  Throughout the entire ceremony people could be heard weeping, and when it came to the last hymn -chosen by Narcissa herself -the little church was filled with sobbing.  Familiar voices joined Narcissa's flawless soprano <B>in </B>the first stanza:<br>
<br>
Yes, my native land I love thee<br>
All thy scenes I love them well:<br>
Friends, connections, happy country,<br>
Can I bid you all farewell?<br>
Can I leave you,<br>
Far in heathen lands to dwell?<br>
     
As the singing progressed these poignant sentiments overcame the assembled guests.  "Home -thy joys are passing lovely - Happy home! -'tis sure I love thee! ... Scenes of sacred peace and pleasure, Holy days and Sabbath bell.  One by one the voices grew muffled and died out.  When it came to the last stanza, brave Narcissa was singing solo:<br>
<br>
In the deserts let me labor<br>
On the mountains let me tell,<br>
How he died-the blessed Savior -<br>
To release a world from hell!<br>
Let me hasten,<br>
Far in heathen lands to dwell.<br>
<br>
One of the most baffling details of the story is the selection of Henry and Eliza Spalding to accompany the Whitmans and share their evangelical tasks.  Those two fervent toilers in the early mission field were equally fitted for the high demands of their vocation-with one vital exception.<br>
<br>
Henry was a rejected suitor of Narcissa's.  A man of touchy pride and smoldering resentments, over quick to place blame on others, Henry Spalding had never forgiven Narcissa Prentiss for rejecting his suit.  Did Narcissa underestimate the full extent of his resentment? Was Marcus not acquainted at the time with all the facts? Or did they both  decide,  with  true  Christian   spirit,   to let bygones be bye gones ? We will never know.<br>
<br>
Narcissa's detailed and informative letters describing the trip across the continent reveal, however, that on the whole she enjoyed the great adventure.  For one thing, she was in love, and though the decorum of the period, and her own natural modesty, prevented her from writing any garrulous confidences, it is clear that she was happy.<br>
<br>
To her austere but affectionate mother, quite straightforwardly she writes, "I think I should like to whisper in mother's ear many things which I cannot write.  If I could only see her in her room for one half hour.  This much I can [say], I have one of the kindest husbands and the very best every way."<br>
<br>
Narcissa was extremely fortunate on the western trip, for she was in good health at the time.  Although before the journey ended she had become pregnant-like countless women who were to follow her westward in the years ahead -she was able to continue riding her horse and to keep up with the stiff time schedule the travelers had to set themselves in their race against the weather.<br>
<br>
By the greatest good fortune she could also "take hold of" buffalo meat with "good relish," and since this was the staple of diet on the plains, her plight could have been serious had buffalo flesh repelled her.  Poor Eliza, who literally could not stomach the fresh
meat or the "jerky" either, nearly died of malnutrition.<br>
<br>
Through the intervention of what the missionaries devoutly took for the hand of Providence, they had been able to catch up with the annual fur caravan from St. Louis, bound for the summer rendezvous at the Green River in the foothills of the Rockies, carrying supplies for the beaver-trapping mountain men.  Otherwise they might never have made it to Oregon.<br>
<br>
What is more, had not Marcus already taken that earlier trip across the plains with Dr. Parker in this same rough company, it is quite likely that the missionaries would have been rudely refused the privilege of accompanying the caravan.  For the men of this annual expedition were, in the main, wild and rough adventurers, many of them exiles from civilization in revolt against cramming association with pious men and women.<br>
<br>
Whitman, on that earlier trip, had the good fortune to encounter one of the most famous of the mountain men, Jim Bridger, who had heard that a doctor was traveling with the caravan and came to ask Marcus to remove an arrowhead lodged in his back. Marcus agreed to try and Bridger after belting himself with whiskey, lay down in the midst of an interested audience of trappers and Indians while Marcus, with the crude instruments at hand, removed the arrowhead (Some years later, when the Whitmans were established at Waiilatpu, Jim Bridger sent his half-breed daughter to live with them.)<br>
<br>
After this successful operation, other mountain men and even Indians with embedded arrowheads had come to seek Whitman's help, and therefore when he reappeared among them a year later with a wife and two missionary companions, the fur caravan was ready to accept his presence.<br>
<br>
It was by no means easy for the Whitmans and the Spaldings<br>
to associate with men of this caliber.  The cursing and drinking, the unsanctified bonds with Indian women, the general filth and corruption, were very hard to tolerate.  Mrs. Whitman was later to suffer greatly from the lack of her own kind of society.  As the Reverend H. K. W. Perkins, a missionary acquaintance of Narcissa's, was to write to her sister Jane, Narcissa should never have gone to the Far West in the first place.  It was plainly a kind of suicide," for she belonged by nature in a polished and exalted sphere."<br>
<br>
Yet some degree of admiration for her must surely have stirred in the breasts of the rough men she met along the way.  Her fine carriage, her animation, above all her glorious singing voice, were the wonder of many who encountered her.  Joe Meek, a mountain man of Bridger's fame and stature, often recalled in later years the radiant vision that had come riding toward him across the wild land.  
Like Bridger, Meek too was to send his little half-breed daughter to the Whitman mission to be cared for by Narcissa, and her small body was among the other mutilated ones which Meek had to find and bury after the massacre.<br>
<br>
When the party arrived at Fort Vancouver, Marcus and Henry went on up the Columbia River, to locate land for their missions, while Narcissa and Eliza stayed behind and were royally pampered by the Hudson's Bay Company's famous factor, John McLaughlin.  Gentlemen insisted nightly on toasting them in wine-over their blushing protests as members of the "Tea total Society." Narcissa dwelt at some length in her letters home on the food they enjoyed at Vancouver-a not-surprising emphasis after the diet they had tolerated for so many months.<br>
<br>
Roast duck was an everyday dish, also salmon, sturgeon, boiled pork and tripe, every diner to make his choice-and "at every new dish clean plate." It was all very high style indeed, and a memory on which Narcissa must often have dwelt in the years to come when she became virtually a slave to domestic drudgery, with hardly a single moment of peace in her own kitchen, due to the constant presence of the curious-and dirty-Cayuses, and later of exhausted, travel-weary emigrants.<br>
<br>
When Marcus came back down the Columbia to say that he and Spalding had selected their home sites-a very injudicious 120 miles apart, at Henry's insistence - Narcissa, though now in her fourth month of pregnancy, refused McLaughlin's pressing invitation to remain at least through the winter.  With reluctance and obvious apprehension, this "most sympathetic man" saw both women set off with Marcus in a pouring rain in a small open boat.<br>
<br>
Though Marcus did not realize it at the time, he had invited bad luck when he chose to settle among the Cayuses.  To begin with, when there had been competition between the various tribes over the honor of having on their own land these strange white people who did not come to trade but to teach, the Cayuses had begged hard for the privilege of being their hosts.<br>
<br>
Yet only a short time has passed before we find Narcissa writing about a Chief Umtippe, "full of all manner of hypocracy, deceit and guile," who had decided that the missionaries must pay the Indians for the privilege of learning to speak the Cayuse tongue!<br>
The Cayuses' initial eagerness to learn  about  the  white  man's<br>
God and the teachings in the sacred "Black  Book"  was  not  long-<br>
lived.<br>
<br>
Unlike the more intelligent and devout Nez Perces, whom Henry Spalding had chosen, the Cayuses were soon angered by Whitman's demands for a "change of heart." Narcissa's own words convey a very good idea of what soon began to go on in the Indian mind:<br>

<br>
"Some feel almost to blame us for telling them about eternal realities.  One said it was good when they knew nothing but to hunt, eat, drink and sleep; now it was bad.... Of late my heart yearns over them more than usual.  They feel so bad, disappointed, and some of their angry, because husband tells them that none of them are Christians; that they are all of them <B>in </B>the broad road to destruction, and that worshipping will not save them.<br>
<br>
"They try to persuade him not to talk such bad talk to them, as they say, but talk good talk, or tell some story, or history, so that they may have some Scripture names to learn.  Some threaten to whip him and to destroy our crops, and for a long time their cattle were turned into our potato field every night to see if they could compel him to change his course of instruction with them."<br>
<br>
These ominous difficulties sank into at least temporary insig-
nificance for Narcissa with the arrival, on her own twenty-ninth birthday, of a little blonde, blue-eyed girl whom they named Alice Clarissa after her Prentiss and Whitman grandmothers.  Narcissa did not have a difficult labor and-greatest of all blessings for a frontier woman-she had abundant milk with which to nurse the infant.<br>
<br>
The appearance of this first white child seemed for a time a hopeful augury of better relations with the Indians, for her birth was an event of great excitement and pride to the Cayuses.  None among them was more delighted than Tilaukait, the eventual murderer, who told the Whitmans that they should call the child "Cayuse te-mi" (girl) because she was born on "Cayuse wai-tis" (ground).<br>
<br>
The child was an indescribable joy to lonely Narcissa, left so much in solitude while Marcus went off among the Indians.  It is difficult to account for the neglect of Narcissa at this time by her apparently devoted family.  Even allowing for the slowness and general chanciness of mail delivery in the Far West-where letters came addressed simply to "So and so, west of the Rocky Mountains" how could two years and five months have passed before a single word from loved ones reached Marcus and Narcissus.<br>
<br>
Yet she, though so singularly neglected, went right on generously sending detailed accounts of her strange new life something for which all historians of the Pacific Northwest should forever offer their grateful thanks.  Early in the Waiilatpu days we find her writing in desperation, "Who will come over and help us? Weak, frail nature cannot endure excessive care and anxiety any great length of time, without falling under it.  I refer more particularly to my husband.  His labor this spring has affected his health considerably.  His old complaint in his side affects him occasionally."<br>
<br>
And in truth there was no end to the sheer drudgery.  First off, there was their own house to make, from the simplest of materials
and with the crudest of implements.  Domestic stock had to be purchased from the Hudson's Bay Company, and the Indians instructed in the feeding and care of pigs, chickens, and cows.  They must also be taught, for the first time, the most elementary principles of agriculture; for instance, how to employ such a simple tool as a hoe.<br>
<br>
The Whitmans had also to set about learning the Cayuse language to ease the problem of their personal relations.  They must immediately set up a school -without books or a building-and they must, above all, establish a pattern of divine service for the Indians.  All this they must do against an increasingly resistant wall of laziness, abysmal ignorance, and indifference, hardening slowly into active antipathy.<br>
<br>
At the end of two years, to the great surprise and joy of the Whitmans, nine missionaries arrived at Waillatpu, coming on from the East to establish other teaching centers among the various Indian tribes.  Their arrival swelled to thirteen the number of Presbyterian workers in the Oregon mission field.  It was never to grow any larger.<br>
<br>
However, although they had prayed for this reinforcement, the arrival of so many people to crowd the inadequate living quarters at Waiilatpu became a source of strain and irritation-particularly to overburdened Narcissa, already beginning to show the first evidence of the frayed nerves that the hard life and unbroken strain were to produce in her delicate and sensitive nature.<br>
<br>
While the somewhat ill assorted missionary brothers went scouting for their separate mission sites, guided by Whitman and Spalding the sisters, left behind at crowded Waiilatpu failed to steer an unvaryingly serene course in their dealings with one another.<br>
<br>
Mary Richardson Walker, from Maine, waiting in natural anxiety for her first children to be born, was irked by her living quarters, a little lean to room with no heat in it.<br>
<br>
Without any opportunity whatsoever for "collecting herself" among the six white families and the eternal presence of the inquisitive Cayuses, Mary characteristically took to her journal and has left us some pithy comment, not only on her own shortcomings but on those of Narcissa as well: of the latter . . . "in a worry about something, cross with everyone; went out and blustered around and succeeded in melting over her tallow.  Mrs. W. has dealt . largely in powder and balls of late."<br>
<br>
There is touching evidence that poor, beset Narcissa was often repentant and tried to make amends.  So much did she deplore her own faults that on one occasion she wrote a letter home that seems excessive in its self-condemnation: "Perhaps never in my whole life have I been led to see so distinctly the hidden iniquity and secret
evils of my heart. . .. Of all persons I see myself to be the most unfit for the place I occupy on heathen ground."<br>
<br>
Narcissa, alas, was quite right in this statement of her essential unfitness for the life she had chosen, but entirely wrong in her diagnosis of the reasons for her small dally failures.  She was already <B>asking of her</B> nature <B>something that it</B> could not supply.<br>
<br>
To anyone who reads Narcissus intimate revealing letters and journal, it becomes almost unbearable to face the great tragedy that now visited her-the loss of her only child, the one bright and shining spot in a deprived and burdensome existence.<br>
<br>
The day of Alice Clarissa's death was the Sabbath, which to one of Narcissa's faith must have seemed a special grace, helping her to bear the agony.  On that Sunday, Alice had been playing in and out of the open door, but when it came time for dinner and she was not around, Narcissa sent Margaret, the young Indian housemaid, to get her ready for the meal.<br>
<br>
The little Indian did not find her but, without coming back to say so, went on into the garden to get vegetables for dinner.  While she was gone, Mungo, a Hawaiian servant at the mission, came into the kitchen to report the odd fact that he had seen two cups floating in the river.  Marcus, intent on his Bible-reading, said only: "Let them be and get them out to-morrow because of the Sabbath." But Narcissa suddenly remembered her child taking two cups from the kitchen some time that morning..<br>
<br>
She cried out <B>in </B>terror.  Where was Alice. Where was the Indian girl who had been sent to find her;! So great was Narcissa's sudden fear that everyone ran from the house at once in a frantic search. Finally an old Indian entered the stream and found the child's body under a root.<br>
<br>
Narcissa, in a letter to the grand parents, recreated the full<br>
horror of the moment:<br>
<br>
I ran to grasp her to my breast, but husband outran me and took her up from the river, and in taking her into his arms and pulling her dress from her face we thought she struggled for breath, but found afterwards that it was only the effect of the atmosphere upon her after being in the water.<br>
<br>
Narcissa made the child's shroud herself.  Some have it that she made it from her wedding dress, but the truth seems to be that it was made from the same gray dress she wore for the long journey west.  Narcissa confessed to her parents that they kept the child for four days before burial.<br>
<br>
She did not begin to change in her appearance much for the three first days.  This proved to be a great comfort to me, for so long as
she looked natural and was so sweet and I could caress her, I could not bear to have her out of my sight.<br>
<br>
Narcissa was never to bear another child, and it is clear that some heart for the evangelical enterprise went out of her after <B>she sustained this</B> loss.  True to their unquestioning faith, however, both Whitmans accepted the inscrutable will of God.  They even found ways to justify it, in believing that their loss had "softened" them so that they could take into their lives unwanted children born to others, a little Indian boy and two neglected half-breed daughters of the mountain men, Bridger and Joe Meek.  Later they adopted seven orphaned emigrant children who had lost both father and mother en route to Oregon.<br>
<br>
After Alice Clarissa's death, eight difficult years were to pass before the end at Waiilatpu.  Within the mission frequent disa-
greements arose, born of divergent viewpoints on policy and procedure toward the Indians.  Some of the missionaries wanted more prayer and formal worship, longer seasons of soul-saving.<br>
<br>
Others felt that it would be wiser to emphasize practical matters: growing crops, weaving cloth, milling grain, raising sheep and cattle, teaching the English tongue.  Throughout this time there is little doubt that Henry Spalding was getting in his licks at the Whitmans.  In a letter to her father in 1840 Narcissa wrote to say of Henry, "Every mind in the mission that he has had access to, he has tried to prejudice against us."<br>
<br>
Trouble with the moody and insolent Cayuses was constantly increasing-a situation quite unlike that of the Spaldings among the intelligent Nez Perces, or the Walkers and Eells among the more tractable Spokanes.  Marcus' patience and Christian forbearance often seem remarkable.  He has left a description of one encounter that shows the length to which he was prepared to go in demonstrating a humble and Christ-like spirit:<br>
<br>
He [the Cayuse] then took hold of my ear and pulled it and struck me on the breast ordering me to hear -as much as to say, we must let them do as they pleased.... When he let go I turned the other to him and he pulled that, and in this way let him pull first one and then the other until he gave over and took my hat and threw it into the mud.  I called on the Indians who were at work . . . to give it to me and I put it on my head -when he took it off again ... and threw it in the mud and water, of which it dipped plentifully.  Once more the Indians gave it back to me and I put it on all mud as it was, and said to him "Perhaps you are playing."<br>
<br>
To be sure, the Whitmans were not always so forbearing.  That invaluable and analytical Mr. Perkins, who appraised Narcissa's character so shrewdly for her sister, did not feel that either of the two Whitmans was a natural "missionary" to the Indians.  They
were, he thought, too civilized, too proud, too aware of their own superiority.<br>
<br>
The Reverend Mr. Perkins, in his long letter to Jane Prentiss, used an interesting modern word to explain the Whitmans' failure and final tragedy.  They did not "identify" themselves with their Indian charges.<br>
<br>
Within Marcus Whitman there was a constant conflict between his vision of an Americanized Far West and his Christian duty to the original inhabitants of this lovely land; Narcissa too was forever torn between her natural yearnings for the companionship of her equals-for "something exalted-communion with mind," as Perkins put it-and her earnest, fervent wish to start an ignorant race on its long, slow climb to the civilization she so greatly valued.<br>
<br>
Parson Perkins summed her up quite adequately and honestly when he wrote that she "was not a missionary but a woman, a highly gifted, polished American lady."<br>
<br>
Eventually the recurrent internecine strife among the missionaries died out, thanks to earnest sessions of repentance and forgiveness among the persons most concerned, with renewed pledges of better behavior on Henry Spalding's part.  What was more, the first emigrants had begun to trickle past the Whitmans' door, and Marcus rightly judged this to be a hopeful sign of that great flood of settlers he had for so long anticipated.<br>
<br>
By this <B>time, </B>however so many divergent reports of trouble among the isolated missions had reached the mission board in Boston that one day, out of the blue, to the dismay of them all-the Whitmans and Spaldings in particular-an official letter was received, ordering Henry and Marcus to dissolve their missions, Spalding to return at once to the States, and Whitman to join the Walkers and Eells at Tshimakain.<br>
<br>
Marcus bravely volunteered to go back across America in the dead of winter to plead the mission cause, to save Henry Spalding from expulsion, and to set the board straight on the real state of affairs in distant Oregon.<br>
<br>
While he was gone, ailing, distraught Narcissa, now rapidly declining in strength, though only in her thirty-fifth year, was able to enjoy another brief period of comparative comfort and peace -her last.  After an attempted assault on her by an Indian who tried to enter her bedroom at night, every white "neighbor" at Fort Walla 25 miles away and at the scattered missions insisted that she leave Waiilatpu for the duration of her husband's absence.  She finally agreed to spend the winter at The Dalles with a congenial family of Methodist missionaries.
Narcissa herself, n her letters, begins to admit to increasingly poor health: "My eyes are almost gone ... writing is very injurious to me.' She had an internal growth of some <B>kind.  T</B>hough she had stoutly urged on Marcus the necessity of the journey, she missed him cruelly.  It was impossible for her to keep from vivid imaginings of the dangers of a wintertime journey overland and the final outcome of his conference with the mission board in Boston.<br>
<br>
She began to suffer at this time too from melancholy fears of the future: "I am restless and uneasy, numbering the past, anxiously looking forward, struggling between hope and fear." She lived in the vain hope that her adored sister Jane and her husband would accompany Marcus back to Waiilatpu.<br>
<br>
Marcus, after an exhausting journey, succeeded in persuading the board to extend the western mission venture until it had more time to prove its worth.  He returned safely-and <B>in </B>comparatively good health-in the spring of 1843, having hastened his departure in order to join, and thereby lend valuable aid and counsel to, the first great train of emigrants crossing the plains to Oregon.  This was the Great Migration of <B>1</B>843, an important signpost on the widening road of western expansion.<br>
<br>
Sister Jane and her husband did not come to Oregon with the doctor.  We do not know why.  Together, thankful to be reunited once more, the  Whitmans returned to their mission. Although everything seemed peaceful, the charred ruins of their gristmill which had been burned before Narcissa had left for The Dalles, must have spoken to them both of the turbulent, unplumbed depths of the Indian suspicion and malice.<br>
<br>
The Cayuses were, in fact, further than ever from a state of grace.  Disturbed and agitated by the increasing number of white people, they were quite ready to listen to the propaganda of one or two "eastern educated" half-breeds who circulated among them telling them what was, in fact, the bitter truth-that their days as free men were numbered.<br>
<br>
The measles epidemic was the fuse that lit the powder keg.  Not only did Dr. Whitman not cure the sick-virtually an impossibility, no matter how he wore himself out in the attempt, since the Indians had no immunity to this white man's disease but also an ugly rumor had begun to circulate among the Cayuses that he was actually causing deaths by administering poison instead of medicine.<br>
<br>
Whitman had been away from home tending the sick in his own parish and outside it, visiting Spalding, even calling on some<br>
Catholic Missionaries to discuss the growing tensions not only
<br>
between white and red  but also between Protestants and Catholics, both contending for the souls of the aborigines in their respective ways.<br>
<br>
The twenty-ninth of November, <B>1</B>847, dawned cold and foggy.  It began like every other normal day among the regular mission group, grown somewhat larger now with volunteers and hired hands and swollen besides with emigrants stopping over at this welcome oasis on the long, exhausting trail to the gentle valleys of lower Oregon. (So strategically located was the Waillatpu mission that it had, in fact, become almost a hospital for sick and weary travelers, thus adding immeasurably to the Whitmans' already heavy burden.)<br>
<br>
On this gray early-winter morning people were coming down with measles only slowly recovering from them, just as were the Indians in their nearby lodges.  Men were at work as usual in the re-built gristmill.  John Sager, one of the seven emigrant orphans adopted by the Whitmans, was winding twine in the kitchen to be made into brooms.  Others were studying, sewing, cooking, caring for the sick.<br>
<br>
The school had just reopened after an enforced vacation due to the measles epidemic. A tailor was making a much needed suit of clothes for Dr. Whitman. A floor was being laid. They were preparing to butcher beef.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Whitman had not appeared for breakfast that morning, and when one of the young girls took her meal to her room, she found her weeping terribly with a handkerchief pressed against her face.<br>
<br>
In silence she motioned the girl to leave.  She did not touch the food.  Word had come at dawn that another child had died the night before in the lodge of Tilaukait.  The doctor had already gone to perform the burial service.  Did Narcissa sense the impending doom?<br>
<br>
The midday meal came and went.  It was in the afternoon that Tilaukait and Tamahas appeared at the mission house.  On a pretext of securing medicine, they tomahawked the doctor without warning.<br>
<br>
As always with first hand accounts of shocking experiences, the stories vary, but it seems likely that Marcus tried to escape - at least he managed to get outdoors - perhaps hoping thus to save the others from harm.  After striking him several deadly, mutilating blows that he vainly tried to dodge, and after having killed the only male witness, the two Cayuses fled.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Whitman, who had been bathing one of the convalescent children in another part of the mission, rushed to her husband at the news of the assault, and with the aid of two women managed to drag the doctor indoors, where they lifted him to a settee and tried vainly to stanch his bleeding.<br>
<br>

Almost at once, from all sides, the Indians began to attack.  One mission worker, who had been shot and tomahawked near the river, managed to make the house to give warning, but by the time he burst into the room where the doctor already lay bleeding to death, the massacre had begun.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Whitman went to the door to look out.  She was immediately shot in the side under her left arm, and though she fell to the floor with a scream, she managed at once to stagger to her feet and take charge of the terrified group that by now had gathered in the sitting room.  Forced to leave Marcus behind-still breathing but now unconscious and plainly beyond hope-she herded them all up the stairs to a second-story bedroom.<br>
<br>
They had hardly reached this room when the Indians burst in below.  The broken end of an empty gun, held strategically at the top of the narrow stairwell at Mrs. Whitman's suggestion held them temporarily at bay.  And then a friendly Indian  named Tamsucky appeared and urged them all to come down, offering them full protection <B>and </B>safe guidance to the nearest fort.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Whitman was not immediately reassured.  She urged Tamsucky to come upstairs and after some hesitation, for fear that he might be shot, Tamsucky mounted the stairs.  He was able then to persuade her of his good intentions; so much so that she cried, "God has raised us up a friend!" It was arranged that the adults would leave first, while some of the children, promised full protection by Tamsucky, remained behind for the time being, perhaps to spare them exposure in the wintry fields.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Whitman, by now too weak to walk from loss of blood, was carried from the house on a settee.  Hardly had she appeared in the open than the shooting began again.  Tamsucky had been a traitor.  The men carrying Narcissa were shot at once, and a number of bullets entered her body as the settee dropped to the ground.<br>
<br>
An Indian rushed up, overturned it, and thrust her down into the thick November mud, while another Indian lifted her head by its long, pale hair and struck her face viciously with his leather quirt.  No one knows how long it took her to die.  For her, however, death came sooner than for Marcus.  Some of the terrified occupants of the mission house, still in hiding, heard the doctor's groans far on into the night.<br>
<br>
When the Indians had fully satisfied their thirst for revenge and apparently the murder of the Whitmans served as some appeasement, since Narcissa was the only woman they killed they withdrew to their own lodges.  The next day and on days thereafter they returned, however, to feast on the mission stores, forcing the remaining white women to cook for them.<br>
<br>
To what other indignities these women were subjected the record is
not clear.  Altogether, fourteen people had been killed at the mis-
sion; 47 were taken captive and later had to be ransomed.<br>
<br>
The first outsider to reach this hideous scene was a Catholic <B>priest</B> named Brouillet.  On November 30 he visited Tilaukait's camp and heard of the massacre at Waiilatpu. He went to the mission and helped one of the few survivors wash and bury the dead, still lying in the open in all their ghastly mutilation; he read the burial service with quaking knees, the Indians standing at a little distance, painted and armed.<br>
<br>
It was Brouillet also, on his way back from Waiilatpu, who probably saved Spalding's life, for he encountered Henry en route to the Whitmans to pick up his little daughter, Eliza, and warned him to return with all speed to the friendly Nez Perces.  Although Eliza Spalding's life had been spared by the Cayuses, Henry, uncertain of his daughter's fate, did go a little later to Waiilatpu, and it was there that he sat down and wrote in its full horror a detailed description for Narcissa's parents of her last hours on earth.<br>
<br>
The anxious settlers in lower Oregon were quick to pursue the murderers.  The Cayuses, who had looted all they could loot and seemed now to be intent on running the mission plant for their own use, fled into the mountains at the coming of fifty avenging riflemen.  After two years of desperate wandering, five of them voluntarily gave themselves up to justice, among them Tilaukait and Tamahas.<br>
<br>
It was reported that Tilaukait, when asked why he had surrendered answered :"Did not your missionaries teach us that Christ died to save his people? So we die to save our people."<br>
<br>
Perhaps he hoped to save himself death by hanging-the most terrible of all deaths for an Indian.  If so, the hope was vain.  He, Tamahas, and three others went to the scaffold.  In the end the fate they had feared overtook the Cayuses.  They not only lost their land and their freedom, but they lost standing with other Indians like the Spokanes and Nez Perces and were for a long time thereafter anathema to all far western whites.<br>
<br>
It was following the flight of the Cayuses from Waiilatpu that Joseph Meek, along with other riflemen from the Willamette<br>
Valley, undertook the task of removing the dead from their shallow grave, where wolves had already been making their grisly meals, and reburying them.<br>
<br>
Shortly after, Meek set off for Washington as a one-man embassy from Oregon to plead with his cousin, President James K. Polk, for government protection for the settlers and for the admission of Oregon as a territory.<br>
<br>

The massacre of the Whitmans, when made public through Meek's mission, horrified the nation.  Polk determined to settle the matter of Oregon while he was still President.  This was not too easy, for England still had certain claims.  Moreover, Southern interests in Congress had long been blocking the territorial admission of this distant land, hoping to delay until Oregon would enter the Union with the status of another "slave state."<br>
<br>
It was not until the very day before Polk's term expired that Oregon was officially proclaimed a territory.<br>
<br>
Undoubtedly the martyrdom of the Whitmans helped settle the fate of this portion of the American West.  Today, historical museums treasure not only Narcissa's remarkable letters, and other documents from early mission days, but even locks of her bright hair, cut from the mangled body that poor Joe Meek had to help rebury.  The mission precincts have been made a national monument supervised by the National Park Service.<br>
<br>
The site of the ruins has been carefully excavated and plainly marked for all to see, and there is even a small museum that houses artifacts excavated from the site.  Every year thousands of visitors come out from Walla to climb the hill of the rye grass and gaze down at the shaft that marks the grave of the victims.  Perhaps they wonder, as they stand there in the clear bright light, where on the green plains below lie the bones of little Alice Clarissa Whitman, that "treasure invaluable" who briefly gladdened the daily cares of the first white woman to cross the Rocky Mountains.<br>

WHITMAN MURDERERS<br>
<br>
Camilla G. Summers, "The trial and hanging of the Indians accused of the  Whitman murders," <B>Go to the Cowlitz Peter Crawford.</B> Longview, Washington: Speedy Litho Press, 1978, p. 173-175.<br>
<br>
Back on the Cowlitz, Peter planted his one hundred apple trees among the stumps.  He had also bought some sacks of seed potatoes in Oregon City so he got them planted in a cleared strip running southward down the hill from his nouse.<br>
<br>
Now he was ready to do more surveying.  He took a schooner to Portland and went to Israel Mitchell's.  As always, Mitchell was happy to see Peter and had some work he could share.<br>

While there, Peter heard that the Indians accused of the murders during the Whitman massacre were going on trial May 21, in Oregon City.  Their tribal chiefs had some time ago turned over to the Americans five who were blamed for the killings.<br>
<br>
The accused were kept in a building on the island at the tip of the fast-spilling waterfall in Oregon City.  Settlers were afraid no jail in town could be built that would be safe from raids or burning.<br>
<br>
The trial was the talk of the day.  All of the atrocities and horrible incidents during the raid were told and retold among the people even though two years had passed since the November 29th raid.  There was still so much bitterness and hate among the immigrants that the court felt it would be almost impossible to find <B>a </B>fair-minded jury from among the settlers.<br>
<br>
They finally passed a rule that only those persons who had come to Oregon by ship, or those who were American traders, or seaman, or recent Californians would be eligible for <B>jury </B>duty.<br>
<br>
Peter, being acquainted with some of those murdered and some survivers, wanted to attend the trial of the five Indians.  Fifty horses had been offered by the tribes for the services of an attorney to defend the accused.  This was accepted and an attorney appointed.<br>
<br>
Upon entering the court-room on the trial date, Peter recognized Orville C. Pratt, the presiding judge.  For a moment Peter's mind flashed back to the day Judge Pratt arrived in Astoria.  He had been rescued from his grounded ship in the middle of the Columbia entrance and brought by Indians in a canoe to Astoria.  The room quickly filled and soon the attorneys took their places.  During the trial Peter was much impressed with the twenty-five year old prosecuting attorney, Amory Holbrook.<br>
<br>
Among the witnesses called were Mrs. Eliza Hall, Lorinda Bewley Chapman and Josiah Osborn, who had survived the massacre.  Also called were Doctor John McLaughlin, the Reverend H.H Spaulding, and Sticcus, the friendly Indian who worked for the Whitman's at Waiilatpu and often aided American immigrants by showing them shorter routes.<br>
<br>
F.W. Pettygrove was foreman of the grand jury which brought in a verdict of "guilty of murder in the first degree whereupon sentence was pronounced by Judge Pratt that "the convicted shall be hanged at Oregon City on June 3rd, 1850".<br>
<br>
The interpreter told the pronouncement to the Indians and they were led back to their island jail to await their doom.<br>
<br>
Many people felt that Five Crows who had kept Lorinda Bewley (now Mrs. Chapman) a prisoner, should also have been tried, but Five Crows had not taken part in the massacre.
During the ensuing two weeks before the public hanging Peter continued survey work around Milwaukee and did an addition to Portland.<br>
<br>
On the day of the hanging, Peter, in the company of some friends, went to Oregon City by schooner.  They arrived well before the hour of execution-one o'clock.  They milled around with the crowd and from time to time glanced up at the larg6 scaffold that had been built near McLaughlin's Mill.  Five rope nooses hung from the supporting structure.  It was a hushed, tense group of people whose numbers increased as the hour approached.<br>
<br>
At exactly the hour of one o'clock Marshall Joe Meek, a man of prompt habits, brought forth the five Indians: Kloakamus, Tilaukit, Tsuachalkis, Quiamasouskin and Tanahas, who were followed by a Catholic priest.  They ascended the steps of the scaffold, the priest  said  the  final prayer, the ropes were placed around each neck and five black caps (made especially for the occasion) were put over their heads.<br>
<br>
In a distinct and booming voice Joe Meek uttered, "May God have mercy on your souls." The bolt was drawn out and instantly the five men were dangling in the air! The smallest fellow struggled while the other four never kicked.  Marshall Meek looked down and noticing that the slip-knot had failed to draw tight, put his foot upon the knot and held it there until the Indian ceased to struggle.  In a few minutes the bodies were cut down and placed into wooden coffins, provided for the purpose.  The crowd dispersed.  The massacre had been avenged!<br>
<br>
Miles away Indian widows and children wailed their sorrowful chants for their brave husbands and fathers who had tried to strike down the source of the pestilence that was killing their families.<br>

<br>
The Whitmans and Spaldings, Presbyterians, exemplified those who sought to lead, or push, the Indians down the path of divine grace.  Marcus Whitman, handsome and well built, dedicated, hard-working, was a medical doctor turned missionary.  On the eve of facing west from New York in the service of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, he married Narcissa Prentiss, an attractive, lively, likable school teacher of good
intellect.<br>
<br>
In the same small group with the Whitmans came Henry and Eliza Spalding, he a hypersensitive, embittered complainer, she a severe, colorless soul.  They traveled in the American Fur Company caravan of 1836 up the Platte and through the Rockies at South Pass; then they continued down the Snake and Columbia.  In so doing they traced what would soon become the Oregon Trail, and Narcissa and Eliza compel led the curiosity and admiration of mountain men and Indians alike as the first white women to cross the Rockies.<br>
<br>
The Whitmans and Spaldings decided to settle along the fertile meadows and forest lands of the Columbia and Snake River basins, the home grounds of prosperous, semi nomadic Indians who traveled by horse and subsisted on fish and roots as well as game.  These tribes, the Yakimas, Walla wallas, Nez Perces, Cayuses, and Flatheads, among others, tended to be well knit politically and had a strong warrior tradition-not people to be pushed around casually.<br>
<br>
The Spaldings established their mission at Lapwai, near the mouth of the Clearwater River, among the Nez Perces.  The Whitmans erected theirs among the Cayuses, a small tribe of the upper Walla River, at Walilatpu, "the place of the rye grass."<br>
<br>
Though the Spaldings' personal problems suggested an uncertain future for their ministry, Marcus and Narcissa at least superficially seemed an ideal pair to carry out a successful mission to the heathens.  "Perfectly fearless and independent," in the commentary of a coworker, Whitman set about his work with single-minded devotion.  But with Whitman "It was always yes or no.  "<br>
<br>
He never had time to discuss matters.  "What would such a man have in common with an Indian? How could they sympathize with each other?" The answer was, not much, in large ways as well as small.  Narcissa insulted the impulsive, hot tempered Tilokaikt, head chief of the very Cayuse band the missionaries hoped to proselytize, by brusquely rejecting a pair of coyote paws offered as a gift for her newborn daughter.<br>
<br>
On another occasion, observing that among the Indians the women did all the heavy labor, the missionaries put pressure on a chief to change his bad ways.  Their efforts were rewarded, and before long the chief, according to a triumphant diary notation, "did his part of the labor." But in Indian culture labor was the role of women.  By taking that role, the chief had been publicly humiliated-bad business when dealing with an important warrior on his own home ground.<br>
<br>
About this time other missionaries, most notably Jesuits, were arriving in various corners of Oregon country.  The greatest of
the Jesuits was the Belgian Father Pierre Jean De Smet, who in more than three decades touched most of the tribes of the plains and mountains and is said to have traveled 180,000 miles.<br>
<br>
The Jesuits were more tolerant of Indian ways than the Protestants.  Nevertheless, their basic purpose was to make Christians of the Indians, which meant fundamentally changing the institutions, customs, and beliefs the fur men had left intact.  Indian ways proved durable but not totally resistant.<br>
<br>
What the missionaries mainly accomplished-most notably the Spaldings among the Nez Perces-was to create "Christian" and "heathen" factions.  These divisions later took on the additional connotations of "treaty" and "non treaty" and "progressive" and "non progressive." And they contributed importantly to the origins and outcomes of nearly every war between Indians and whites.  Thus the well-intended tampering with another people's culture turned out to be a deadly process-as Marcus and Narcissa Whitman ultimately would discover.<br>
<br>
For a decade after their arrival, however, the Whitmans and Spaldings, the Jesuits, and other zealots went about their work in relative peace, inflicting on the Indians minor irritations and inconveniences that no doubt accumulated and rankled but brought no notable explosions.  Meanwhile, however, far off, forces were building that would loose waves of whites on the West and bring the two cultures into massive confrontation.<br>
<br>
James K. Polk was elected to the White House in 1844 on a platform of territorial expansion, in which he promised to fulfill the nation's "manifest destiny" to overspread the continent.  He began, in 1845, with the annexation of Texas.  Then a year later,<br>
rattling sabers and twisting the British lion's tall, Polk forced a settlement of a long-festering boundary dispute in the Northwest and raised the American flag over the Oregon country.<br>
<br>
Finally, he fought a war with Mexico that ended with United States sovereignty not only over Texas but also the vast Mexican provinces of New Mexico and California.  By 1848 Polk's crusade had added one million square miles to the national domain, planted the western boundary on the shores of the Pacific-and given the United States the ultimate responsibility for dealing with every single Indian west of the Mississippi.<br>
<br>
In that same year of 1848, scarcely two weeks before diplomats in Mexico concluded the treaty ending the Mexican War, a sawmill hand named James Marshall caught a glint of yellow in a newly built millrace among the western foothills of California's Sierra Nevada.  Shouted in the streets of San Francisco, the cry of "Gold! Gold from the American River!" reverberated across the continent and electrified a people already looking west.  
First by ship, and then overland, forty-niners by the thousands raced to California.  They were the vanguard of eight million Americans who in the next four decades would seek adventure and opportunity in the West-and in the process destroy the Indian way of life.<br>
<br>
The first to go were California's Diggers-Indians so called because they subsisted largely on roots and berries-who had the misfortune to be standing squarely in the way when the forty-niners burst into their fragile little societies in the gold country of Sierra Nevada.  The effect was sudden and catastrophic.<br>
<br>
Those who did not scatter were simply annihilated.  "That a war of extermination will continue to be waged until the Indian race becomes extinct, must be expected", declared the state's governor in 1851.  And indeed it was.  Ten percent of the Diggers met death violently.  The rest fell to disease, malnutrition, and starvation.  From almost one hundred thousand comfortable tribesmen in 1846, California's Indian population dropped to thirty thousand impoverished and thoroughly subjugated souls.<br>
<br>
Oregon Indians proved far more formidable adversaries than those <B>in </B>California.  The first hostilities burst from resentments built up among the Indians by the Whitmans and Spaldings.  By 1847 the Cayuses near Waiilatpu nourished a deep hatred of the dogmatic doctor and his unbending wife.<br>
<br>
Neither had ever established rapport with their intended neophytes, <B>and </B>both had continued to offend them with intolerant or patronizing treatment.  Also, competition from Catholic missionaries confused the Cayuses and helped turn them against the Presbyterians.<br>
<br>
Most serious, the Indians believed the Whitmans responsible for the procession of covered wagons that early in the 1840s began to pass their mission bearing settlers.  The Cayuses feared that these Bostons would steal the Indians land as they had in the East.<br>
<br>
In 1847 a passing immigrant train set off an epidemic of measles that killed perhaps half the Cayuse tribe.  Whitman tried to treat the stricken, but the Indians, watching him fuss over their sick friends and families, came to suspect him of poisoning them as part of a plot to seize their land.  That suspicion sealed the fate of the missionaries.<br>
<br>
On November 29, 1847, Chief Tilokaikt and a companion named Tomahas appeared at the Waiilatpu mission to ask for medicine.  As Whitman turned to get it, Tomahas felled him with a tomahawk, then beat him repeatedly.  Other Indians swarmed over the mission
complex, which contained seventy two people, mostly transients.  A bullet wounded Narcissa in title arm; later the Indians carried her from the house and shot her full of bullets.<br>
<br>
Tilokaikt, Tomahas, and other Cayuses killed twelve more men and took five men, eight women, and thirty four children as captives.<br>
<br>
Two days later Catholic missionary Father John Baptiste Brouillet rode into the mission grounds.  The Indians supposed him sympathetic to their deed, and for sheer self-preservation he had to steel himself against the entreaties of the prisoners and the horror of the massacre scene.  "What a sight did I then behold!" he wrote.<br>
<br>
"Ten bodies lying here and there, covered with blood, and bearing the marks of the most atrocious cruelty some pierced with balls, others more or less gashed by the hatchet.  Dr. Whitman had received three gashes on the face.   Three others had their skulls crushed so that their brains were oozing out.  " Brouillet was able to disengage from the Cayuses long enough to warn the Spaldings, also marked for massacre, and they fled their Lapwai mission.<br>
<br>
Oregonians reacted with shock and outrage.  The provisional legislature voted a force of 550 citizen soldiers to march against the Cayuses, and a three-man peace commission to<br>
<br>
try to calm neighboring tribes.  To head the commission the governor appointed Joel Palmer, a man of ability, integrity, and tolerance.  But heading the militia as colonel was Cornelius Gilliam, a bigoted fundamentalist clergyman who had fought Indians back east and regarded extermination as the proper policy for Oregon.<br>
<br>
At the same time the British Hudson's Bay Company, still influential and anxious to prevent a general uprising that would destroy profits, dispatched veteran fur man Peter Skene Ogden to negotiate the release of the hostages.  Fearful that the Bostons and the British might unite against the tribes, the Indians ac-
cepted Ogden's proposed ransom: 62 blankets, 63 cotton shirts, 12 guns, 600 rounds of ammunition, 37 pounds of tobacco, and 12 flints.  By January 1848, therefore, Gilliam was free to advance his army up the Columbia without concern about endangering the captives.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, neither was he concerned about distinguishing between guilty and innocent Indians.  By no means all the Cayuse tribe condoned the course of Chief Tilokaikt and his lieutenants.  In fact, bubbling factionalism, a recurrent theme in Indian history, now raised the prospect of a peaceful resolution of the issue.  But instead of pausing to negotiate, Gilliam blundered
ahead in a belligerent advance that united the squabbling villagers in an alliance to fend off invasion of their homeland.<br>
<br>
Early in February Gilliam attacked and nearly destroyed a camp of innocent Indians, killing twenty or thirty of them.  The survivors turned on Gilliam's troops, killing three and wounding two others.  Palmer and the other peace commissioners, aware that Gilliam's intemperate actions threatened their mission, vainly sought a softening of the colonel's stance.<br>
<br>
Gilliam even refused to provide a small armed escort for the peace emissaries and instead insisted upon accompanying them with his full force, causing the Indians to doubt the sincerity of the peace mission.  After an inconclusive talk with members of the powerful Nez Perce tribe, one of the peace commissioners wrote that "Col Gilliam left the council in a huff and declared he has come to fight and fight he will."<br>
<br>
By March even the persistent Palmer had become so disgusted with Gilliam's blustering interference that he resigned, leaving the field entirely to Gilliam.<br>
<br>
Within the next week 250 Palouse warriors attacked Gilliam's men as they rounded up a few head of cattle they thought belonged to the Cayuses.  In an all-day running battle, the troops retreated to Waiilatpu.  Ten white men had been wounded, and, more important, another Columbia Basin tribe had been turned against the whites.<br>
<br>
Four days later, however, fate removed Gilliam from the field.  While pulling a rope to tether his horse, he caught the rope on the trigger of his gun and was killed instantly.<br>
<br>
Under Gilliam's second-in-command the militia continued to march about the Cayuse country, but their quarry had largely faded into the Nez Perce territory.  Besides exhausting themselves, the Oregon soldiers succeeded mainly in exasperating the Walla wallas, Umatillas, Palouses, and Nez Perces.  Finally it occurred to the whites that they were on the verge of uniting all the Columbia Basin tribes in war, and in June 1848, showing rare common sense, the troops went home.<br>
<br>
For reasons still unclear the ringleaders in the Whitman massacre, Tilokaikt, Tomahas, and three others, gave themselves up early in 1850.  If they supposed the Bostons would be forgiving, or even grant an unbiased hearing, they miscalculated badly.  Tried for murder and convicted, they went to the scaffold on June 3, 1850. The Reverend Henry Spalding offered them Presbyterian comforts, but they rebuffed him in favor of Catholic rites.<br>
<br>
The legacy of the Cayuse skirmishes proved more significant in the
Northwest than the war itself Gilliam's uncompromising course exposed to all the northwestern tribes a side of the white man they had not observed in the firm but reasonable agents of the Hudson's Bay Company.<br>
<br>
Worse yet, frustrated at repeated failures to run down Whitman's murderers, Oregon officials declared Cayuse lands forfeit, thus seeming to confirm the fear of the perpetrators of the massacre that all those white-topped wagons bore people bent upon seizing their lands.  If further notice were needed, the Oregon Donation Land Law enacted by Congress in 1850 opened all land to homesteading without regard to Indian title.<br>
<br>
In future troubles the distrust of Bostons planted in Indian minds by the Cayuse affair figured importantly, and in those crises, too, citizens responded more often in the spirit of Cornelius Gilliam than of Joel Palmer.<br>

Joseph and the Walla Walla Treaty<br>
<br>
Russell Blankenship, "Joseph, and the Walla Walla Treaty," <B>And there were men.</B> New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1942, p. 54-58<br>
<br>
On May 20, 1855, a body of whites was in camp on Mill Creek in the center of the Walla Walla Valley.  The whites were a small escort of soldiers and two official dignitaries, Isaac I. Stevens and Joel Palmer.  The officials wore an air of expectancy.  The Walla Walla Valley, stretching out around the camp, was a favorite place for Indian gatherings, but on this day not a single native could be seen.<br>
<br>
This fact would have been unusual enough at any time, but on this particular May 20th it was all the more surprising in light of the expressed willingness of the chiefs to gather on Mill Creek and go into council with the commissioners appointed by the President to treat with the tribes of that region.  Earlier in the year an emissary from the commissioners bad visited the chiefs and extracted a promise from the leaders to confer with the representatives of the Great White Father about the establishment of reservations.<br>
<br>
By 1855 the missionaries had come and gone.  Their spiritual work with the Indians had not been abundantly fruitful, but in one sense the Protestant zealots had done their work well.  They bad fully advertised the fertility of the soil, the salubrious climate, and the lush pasturage of the Inland Empire.  
To this advertising Americans bent an attentive car.  But before settlers could come into the country something had to be done with the nomad Indians whose land it was by right of immemorial occupation.<br>
<br>
The Protestant missionaries may not have been successful in garnering Indian souls by the thousand, but they clearly saw why their labors were profitless, save as a blessed assurance of their own eternal salvation.  The governing board which sent and controlled the missionaries refused to consider the application of an unmarried man for work in the Western field.<br>
<br>
The reasons for this refusal are nowhere stated, but unfortunately they may be deduced.  The Indians were nomads, and a missionary burdened with a white wife could not keep up with the wandering bands.  Sending married men was not a good policy.  A white teacher established a fixed home, fenced a spring, and proceeded to plow up the land.  His wife, his cattle, and his crops forced him to stay at home.<br>
<br>
Curiosity might bring the Indians in droves to look at the pale-faces, married to blonde women, and while the natives near the mission the teacher could strike a few were camped<br>
blows at Satan.  Not even curiosity and greed, however, could bold the Indians when camas was to be dug, berries gathered, and game killed against the rigors of the approaching winter.  When the redskins went to the hunting grounds, they easily relapsed into comfortable indifference to sin. it is to be feared that this relapse was aided by the medicine men who were mindful of the competition offered by white teachers.<br>
<br>
It was all very discouraging.  Eells and Walker, with their<br>
wives, labored at Tschimakain in the Spokane country for nine years and converted two Indians.  This, it must be admitted, was not a great in gathering of souls.  The work of Whitman at Waiilatpu and of Spalding at Lapwai is a matter of controversy, but these men were only slightly more successful than their confreres in the north.  Then came the vastly over-discussed Whitman massacre.<br>
<br>
Innumerable reasons have been adduced for the massacre, some of which are based more on prejudice than on fact.  Whatever may be the sum total of the reasons, two or three inciting causes would have been sufficient to bring about the tragic event.  Dr. Whitman bad fenced land belonging to the Indians and with true Yankee economy sold the natives produce raised on their own land for which they received neither price nor rental.<br>
<br>
Selling land was an act totally incomprehensible to the Indian, but only slightly less comprehensible and enormously irritating was the missionary's habit of securely fencing the Indians out of desirable camp grounds.  The matter of land occupation alone would
have been sufficient to cause trouble, but other reasons were present.<br>
<br>
Dr. Whitman hired the Indians to work.  However attractive the remuneration might be, the native was unaccustomed and disinclined to manual labor.  By way of admonishing the slothful the doctor used the lash.  Now any experienced mountain man could have told Whitman that a lash laid on the shoulders of a Cayuse brave would ultimately mean revenge with compound interest.<br>
<br>
In the next place, Whitman was a physician.  Unwearied he ministered to sick Indians with marked success.  To the untutored mind of the native this only meant that the doctor was a potent medicine man, heavily endowed with medical skill.<br>
<br>
One trivial incident was conclusive proof to the Indians of the doctor's occult powers.  At Waiilatpu Whitman raised watermelons which attracted the Indians.  To discourage depredations on the melon patch, one of the associates at the mission plugged some of the melons, leaving them on the vines, and inserted a powerful emetic.<br>
<br>
Shortly thereafter a group of young Indians stole the melons and took them to a shady spot to enjoy a surreptitious treat.  In a few minutes the violently retching culprits were firmly convinced that the doctor possessed " heap big medicine."<br>
<br>
When came an epidemic of measles laying whole villages low.  The Indians sent to Whitman for aid, which was not refused, but they also insisted upon employing their traditional therapeutics.  An Indian treated all ailments by the water-cure.  He would build out of reeds or evergreen branches a closely-woven, low, rounded cubicle, which looked like half of a ball standing beside a stream.<br>
<br>
Into his little hut he would carry hot stones.  Then he would crawl in, close the opening, and pour water slowly over the stones.  After sweating himself weak he would totter out and plunge into the cold water of the stream.  A patient suffering from measles who adopted this treatment was dead as soon as he hit the water.<br>
<br>
Mounting fatalities simply proved the contention of the Indians that the doctor was a powerful medicine man, and moreover that he was in league with the powers of evil.  The native practice was to kill instantly any medicine man whose powers became malignant.  They saw no very good reason for not taking the same course with a white sorcerer.<br>
<br>
Any one of these reasons would have caused the death of Whitman.  In combination they brought about the dreadful calamity of November <B>11th, </B>1847.  A punitive expedition of whites did little
except chase the natives back into the hills, but a number of Indians were banged for participation in the murders.  Walker, Eells and Spalding escaped with their families.  The missions were deserted, and the upper country and its people went back to primitive ways.<br>
<br>
But the missionaries had labored to better advantage than they realized.  Their lavish praise of the country bad awakened the sensitive avarice of Americans.  Settlers, fearful of other massacres and alarmed at the fixed hostility of the Indians, demanded that the government place its reluctant wards on reservations.  This was the original suggestion of the mission-
aries.<br>

WHITMAN MASSACRE<br>
<br>
Dorothy Fay Gould, "The Whitman Massacre," <B>Beyond the shining mountains.</B> Portland: Binfords and Mort, 1938. p. 133-139.<br>
<br>
The Indians at first welcomed Marcus Whitman and his wife, especially after a tiny golden haired daughter was born to them, the first American white child born in Old Oregon.  For a time the mission of Waiilatpu on the Columbia, near where Walla Walla is today, attracted their interest.<br>
<br>
They watched the Doctor, with furious energy, start a farm in the wilderness; plowing, fencing, planting an orchard, and building both a saw mill and a flour mill.  Besides holding services, Dr. Whitman learned the Indian language, taught school and practiced medicine.  He truly believed white civilzation would be good for the Indians and he tried to set them the best example of an American home.<br>
<br>
Soon the Indians became restless as they saw other immigrants coming over the mountains) first a few, then thousands.  More and morc of their land was being fenced off by the white men.  There was also an eastern half-breed Indian, Joe Lewis, educated at Dartmouth, who kept warning the Indians to fight before it was too late.<br>
<br>
After Dr. Whitman had demonstrated that a white woman and at least a part of a wagon could make the overland trip to Oregon) he helped lead a thousand im migrants from Fort Hall (Pocatello, Idaho) to La Grande where the Indian guide could take them across the Blue Mountains.  "Oregon or Bust" was their slogan.  
When they reached the Mission at Waiilatpu, Dr. Whitman supplied them with food and Mrs. Whitman helped care for the children.  Many children came to live at the mission so that they could attend school under Mrs. Whitman.  A deacon's daughter, she had been educated at the -famous Emma Willard Academy ill New York.  "She sang like an angel", the immigrants said.<br>
<br>
A few Indians, some half-breeds and many immigrant children went to her school.  Those who could, pay for these privileges did so.  Some malcoiiteiits complained because the Whitmans obtained money in this way as well as for their farm products.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, these first settlers brought with them the white man's maladies: measles, smallpox,    tuberculosis and worse.  Because the Indians died of these diseases much more often than the white people, they accused the Doctor of poisoning them with his medicine that he might take their land for himself.  The Indian method of curing measles was to crawl into a sweat bath and then to jump into a cold river.<br>
<br>
In time of illness medicine men would jump up and down on the sick man to drive the "sickness devil" out of him.  Inevitably such treatment killed many patients and the Indiaiis muttered and blamed Dr. Whitman for the deaths tliat resulted.  A friendly chief advised the angry natives to send two sick men and one well man to the mission for treatment.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, all three Indians died.  Also one of the mission men objected to the thieving lndians who stole garden produce.  To protect a melon patch, he impregnated the outer row of melons with some of the Doctor's ipecac.  Poison was also put in some meat and set out to kill -wolves.  Indians ate the melons and the meat with unfortunate results.<br>
<br>
The next day, Sunday, November 29, 1847, upon the pretense of getting medicine, some Indians came to the mission.  While the Doctor was bent over his medicine chest, To-ma-kus drew a tomahawk from under his blanket and dealt him two blows, the first on the back of his head and the second on top, the latter causing his death.<br>
<br>
Upon a promise of safety Mrs. Whitman and a number of children who were upstairs, many of them sick with the measles, were led down amid the yells of the fiends and the groans of the dying.  Despite the promise, Mrs. Whitman was shot through the breast as she stood in the doorway, and later dragged by the hair into the yard and beaten to death.<br>
<br>
Twelve of the boys and men were killed.  Eleven persons were sick in bed, some of whom were clubbed to death, and many were carried off to Indian villages.  It was Christmas before the Hudson's Bay factor at Fort Vancouver, Peter Skene Ogden, succeeded in ransoming them. <B>lii</B> spite of hostility toward the Americans, the British fuitraders felt that it was most unsafe to permit the
Indians a victory over the whites.<br>
<br>
Peter Skene Ogden felt sympathy for the sufferers, too.  The ransom paid for the captives was sixty-two blankets, sixty-three cotton shirts, twelve guns, six hundred load of ammunition, thirty seven pounds of tobacco and twelve flints,<br>
<br>
For years the graves at Waiilatpu were covered onlv by a pile of stones.  Wolves scattered some of the bones and skulls.  Then Dr. Penrose, a young minister, came out from Williams and Yale as president of a college, in the nearby town of Walla Wallay which was named as a memorial to the Whitmans.<br>
<br>
He tells that fifty years after the tragedy he gathered up the seven skulls and attempted to identify them before the human remnants of this terrible massacre were finally and properly buried.  He decided that the only woman's skull must be that of Mrs. Whitman.<br>
<br>
Another had a prominent jaw bone and a gold-filled tooth.  It was well known that Dr. Whitman had a firm protruding chin and that he had been exceedingly proud of a gold tooth.  Both skulls were sawed across with one of the martyred Doctor's instruments, and one bore two tomahawk marks, one on the top and one on the back.  Some think that the Indians cut Dr. and Mrs. Whitman's heads open to let out the devils they believed were bent on the destruction of the Indians.  It was by such bits of information that Dr. Penrose identified the bones.<br>
<br>
A ptortralt was painted of this famous first American woman to live in what is ii6w the State of Washington.  Taking Mrs. Whitman's skull, which had a wide forehead aild deep set eye-sockets; a few strands of golden hair that had clung to the sagebrush after the massacre, as well as facts mentioned in her letters home, Mrs. Allen, the artist, set to work.  Mrs. Whitman mentioned in a letter that she fluffed out her hair upon hearing that her husband was approaching home after a journey.<br>
<br>
A sample of the gray dress she took West with her was obtained from her family and the old embroidered sleeves she left behind when she started West were sent to the artist.  Even the pink cameo broach she wore at her throat was painted in.  The picture is as like her as these facts made it possible to be.  It now hangs oii a wall of Whitman College, that institution which so eagerly carries on in the Far West the missionary traditions of plain living and high thinking.<br>
<br>
The story of the massacre of Marcus and Narcissa Whitman lighted a flaring torch, calling such attention to the Far West that it seemed to beckon thousands to the new promised land.  In the Indian wars, the Cayuse tribe, some of whose members were leaders in the massacre, was almost exterminateds either in battle or by
the measles.  Today the word "cayuse" survives as the name of a particularly hardy pony.<br>

THE WHITMAN MASSACRE.<br>
<br>
Edgar I. Stewart, "The Whitman Massacre," <B>Washington Northwest Frontier.</B> New York: Lewis Historical Publishing Company, 1957, Volume I, p. 371-391.<br>
<br>
The month of August, <B>1838, </B>saw a great program of reorganization forced upon the missionaries who had been sent out by the American Board.  Thirteen missionaries were felt to be too many for the two stations that were in operation, so it was decided that new ones should be established.<br>
<br>
The Reverend Samuel Parker had been particularly impressed with the prospects among the Spokanes so it was only natural that a new station should be planned in that region.  Here Cushing Eells and Elkanah Walker were to be located.  They accordingl selected a site about twenty-five miles north of the present <B>city </B>of Spokane, and near the village of Ford, which was known as Tshimakain or "the place of springs."<br>
<br>
But the-necessity of having adequate buildings before the onset of winter made it impossible to establish the mission that year, and so both families stayed with the Whitmans until spring.  Two or more families under one roof generally leads to consider-able friction, and this winter at Waiilatpu was no exception.  The Smiths and Mr. Rogers were also there as it had been intended that this would be their principal station.<br>
<br>
Congestion was too mild a term for the situation that existed.' the existing residential facilities were not only crowded but there were personality conflicts within the group, and even missionaries under certain circumstances can get on each others' nerves, as was conclusively demonstrated in this instance, and a great deal of friction developed.<br>
<br>
Of this Mrs. Whitman seemed to be the focal point or storm center.  Possessed of many admirable qualities and in every sense of the word truly a dedicated person, Narcissa Prentiss Whitman was certainly a woman with whom it was not easy for others to get along.  In fact it is extremely doubtful if either she or her husband was re-ally qualified in the emotional sense for the work that they had undertaken.<br>
<br>
On the twenty-third day of June, 1839, Alice Clarissa, only child
of the Whitmans, lost her life by drowning.  It was a Sunday and since the Whitmans, in common with many others of that day and generation, believed that only the most essential tasks should be performed on the Sabbath, there was an astonishing, lack of supervision of the child's activities.<br>
<br>
Even when she was first discovered to be missing little alarm was felt and it was not until some time later that a search was organized.  By then it was too late, although it is extremely doubtful if an earlier search would have saved the little girl's life since she had fallen into Mill Creek and had been swept away downstream where she had been caught by the projecting root of a tree, the current then pulling her under and holding her fast.@<br>
<br>
That there was a certain amount of carelessness and neglect on the part of the Whitmans seems to be beyond doubt, but it was mitigated by the stupidity of some of the servants and that it was obviously impossible to keep a check on the child's activities every moment of the day.<br>
<br>
Although the grief of both Mr. and Mrs. Whitman was great, the most important thing about the incident as far as future developments were concerned was the effect that it had on the Indians.  Alice Clarissa had been a great favorite with many of the chiefs; they had regarded her in some ways almost as one of them since she had been born on land claimed by the Cayuse tribe.<br>
<br>
In a sense they regarded her death as an indignity, as a studied insult to the tribe, and at least professed to believe that Whitman could have averted it if he had so desired. ne@ reasoned that if Whitman were the great medicine man that he claimed to be, he would not have allowed his own daughter to perish in this way.  While a philosophy of this sort is difficult for a modem person to understand, it was a typical Indian reaction.<br>
<br>
While we cannot safely assert that had it not been for the tragic death of Alice Clarissa the Whitman tragedy might have been averted, the relations between the natives and the missionaries would certainly have been better than they were.  By this incident Whitman lost face with the natives, and from this time on there is a progressive deterioration of relations between the two groups that was certainly one of the most important factors in bringing on the final tragedy.<br>
<br>
The death of Alice Clarissa had a temporary effect in that it drew the Spaldings and the Whitmans closer together and for a time there was a marked decrease in the rancor and active dislike that each seems to have entertained for the other.  But this respite was not destined to be permanent for within a year the old discord had returned -and the other missionaries were sending letters back to the American Board which were highly critical of Spalding.<br>
<br>
In reading the records of those days one cannot help but be
impressed by the display of pettiness and maliciousness that seems to have affected everyone connected with any of the missions.  Spalding was the center of the controversy and was the subject of most of the complaints that found their way back to Boston.  For this Spalding's personality seems to have been largely at fault, he was probably too aggressive and was too ready to find fault with what he regarded as the derelictions of the others.<br>
<br>
He seems to have expected his fellow laborer in the Lord's vineyard to come closer to perfection than he did himself, without being aware of his own imperfections.  Although Spalding was criticized for spending too much of his time on secular matters, and in attempting to bring about the settlement of the Indians on the land, these were projects in which all of the others were at least somewhat interested so that the differences between them would be of degree rather than of kind.<br>
<br>
On the tenth of October, Mrs. Whitman, in a letter to her father, placed the blame on Spalding, who apparently could neither forgive nor forget the fact that he had been Narcissa's unsuccessful suitor, and she said pointedly that Spalding's jealousy had nearly broken up the mission.<br>
<br>
That summer several things of importance happened.  The year before Joe Meek and party had reached the mission, having achieved the distinction of being the first emigrants to bring wagons across the Blue Mountains.  This incident, insignificant in itself, was the symbol of what was to come; for Meek and his fol-
lowers had demonstrated that it was not only possible but feasible to bring wagons all the way from Independence to the mission at Waiilatpu, and the years which followed were to see more and more white-topped wagons thronging the trail that led westward.<br>
<br>
There were hundreds and even thousands of these wagons crowding down into the valley of the Columbia River.  Nor were the possibilities inherent in the situation lost upon the Indians into whose lands these newcomers were moving.<br>
<br>
Also Pierre Pambrun, who had been in charge of the Hudson's Bay Company post at Fort Walla Walla, was killed while breaking a wild horse- and had been succeeded by Archibald McKinlay, a son-in-law of Peter Skene Ogden.  Pambrun was a Catholic and while he had always been friendly to the Protestant missionaries, Whitman had been greatly disturbed by the fact that the Catholic priests had been holding meetings at the fort, but since McKinlay was a Scotch Presbyterian, Whitman felt that the change was decidedly for the better.<br>
<br>
In the same summer members of the Wilkes expedition visited the fort and provided the variety of fresh faces of people from both strange and familiar places with whom to converse.  But probably the most important happening of that event-filled summer was the fact that Spalding finally learned of the great body of complaints against him and that they had been sent to the headquarters of the
American Board.<br>
<br>
To say that he was shocked and dismayed by the news is to state the case too mildly.  But -at a meeting of the missionaries there was a frank exchange of opinions which did much to "clear the air." It was decided that any action taken by the Board as a result of the complaints would not be honored until after the Board had been informed of the changed situation and given an op-
portunity to rescind its action.<br>
<br>
But harmony was not completely restored nor the scars of battle entirely healed, and the missionaries still continued to mistrust one another.  T,heir- disagreements had another unfortunate result.  <B>The</B> Indians could not have helped but know of them and to contrast the quarrels of the Protestants with the quite uniform zeal and fidelity of the Catholics.<br>
<br>
That fall, Dr. Elijah White, the newly appointed sub-Indian agent for Oregon Territory arrived at the mission on his way to the Willamette.  Among other things he carried an order from the American Board, based on the complaints which had been sent east two years before.  The time lapse in this case offers an excellent illustration of the difficulty <B>in </B>carrying on almost any kind of an activity at any distance in a period of such poor communication.<br>
<br>
A report or an order would be sent, but before it could be received the situation might have changed so completely that the order or instructions would be equally incongruous.  This was the case with the order which Dr. White carried.  Two years before it would have been applicable; now it was hopelessly out of date.  It directed that the missions at Waiilatpu and Lapwai be closed since the fewest and least promising of the Indians were those located near Whitman's station while Spalding at Lapwai was the subject of most of the complaints, and the most of the mission force was to be concentrated at Tshimakain, among the Spokane Indians who seemed the most promising of the Eastern Washington tribes.<br>
<br>
The order which was dated the twenty-fifth of February also directed that Spalding should return east, travelling by way of the Oregon Trail instead of by the sea route.<br>
<br>
Inasmuch as Spalding was the man at whom most of the criticisms had been directed, it would seem that the others should have expected something of the sort in view of their earlier action, but they seem to have been genuinely surprised at the broad sweep of the Board's directive.<br>
<br>
They may have also been experiencing at least a few twinges of conscience at the havoc that had resulted from this exhibition of a lack of Christian charity.  They knew that the order was totally unrealistic since there had been such a great change in conditions at the various missions.  But they realized full well the
difficulties inherent in securing a modification of the order, in light of the conditions of communication of which they had just received such an example.<br>
<br>
It was this that led to Whitman's suggestion that one of them should make the journey east and explain the changed situation to the Board.  From the beginning Whitman apparently planned to make the trip himself.<br>
<br>
Since Spalding obviously could not go,-the Board simply might order him to stay there-someone else had to be chosen and Whitman apparently volunteered when no one else suggested his name.  To this the others were somewhat reluctant to agree since he was the only physician in the region, and in the light of the existing situation he probably should not have gone.<br>
<br>
But Whitman, who seems to have had a very high sense of drama and of destiny, and who no doubt was anxious to get his side of the controversy before the Board, finally carried his point and Eells and Walker at last agreed to his going, although apparently, with -considerable reluctance.  But he took his departure with such precipitancy-leaving nearly two weeks ahead of the time planned-that he left some of the letters behind and also departed without a number of very essential articles that he would need on the trail.<br>
<br>
This action, which no doubt resulted from a desire to get through the mountains before the passes were closed by winter snow, had one serious result in that he left without making adequate provision for the care of his mission during his absence, nor for the personal safety and protection of Mrs. Whitman who was practically left alone and unprotected in the untamed wilderness and surrounded by savage foes.<br>
<br>
Gray, who was still at Waiilatpu, was asked to find someone in the Willamette Valley who would come up and look after the mission until Whitman's return, but it was not until a considerable time later that a caretaker was arranged for.  Whitman rode off apparently assuming that the matter would be taken care of and never giving it a second thought.<br>
<br>
And that Mrs. Whitman was exposed to real danger is apparent from the fact that only three days after her husband's departure she was made the victim of an attempted assault by one of the natives.  At about midnight on the sixth of October, she was aroused by what she thought was someone trying to enter the room.  Noticing that the latch had been raised she went to the door land closed it and again fastened the latch.<br>
<br>
But the door was then pushed partly open and Mrs. Whitman called for one of the friendly Indians; at which the attacker fled.  The next day Mrs. Whitman discussed the incident with some of the Cayuse chiefs, including the attacker who is supposed to have been an Indian by the name of Tamsucky, but whom she apparently did not
suspect.<br>
<br>
Whitman left Waiilatpu on the morning of Monday, the third of October, 1842, accompanied by a young man named Asa Lovejoy, who had been travelling for his health and had accompanied White's party west.  In those days a western trip with the accompanying life in the open was a standard prescription or recommendation for the cure of tuberculosis, or consumption as it was then known.<br>
<br>
Lovejoy had, however, stopped off at the Whitman mission -and he now agreed to accompany the Doctor east.  The two men followed what was later to become known as the Oregon Trail as far east as Fort Hall.  Then, apparently because of the heavy snows as well as the reported hostility of the tribes of the plains, they turned south.  White, who had been guided on the westward trip by Thomas Fitzpatrick, had been stopped west of Independence Rock by the Sioux, and had been warned that the emigrants must keep out of the Sioux country.<br>
<br>
So Whitman and Lovejoy made a long detour to the south, ultimately reaching St. Louis by way of Taos, Santa Fe and Bent's Fort.  From there Whitman went on to Washington, where he. apparently spent only a few hours, New York and Boston, where his reception was cool, unwelcome, and even hostile.<br>
<br>
In all of these places his uncouth frontier garb attracted con-
siderable attention and called down on his head the displeasure of some of the more narrow-minded members of the American Board.  The Board also reproved him for leaving his mission station without having secured its advance approval!<br>
<br>
In view of the attitude adopted by some of the men in charge it is somewhat surprising that Protestant missionary activity should have succeeded as well as it did.  The Board, after refusing to rescind its order of the previous year for Spalding's dismissal and the closing of the two stations, finally reversed itself and decided to allow them to remain as they were for at least a while longer.-<br>
<br>
In Washington Whitman may possibly have talked to some highly placed American officials.  He seems to have discussed with Mr. Porter, the Secretary of War, the subject of fortifying the Oregon Trail, and also the practicability of taking wagons over the trail as f-ar as the Columbia River.<br>
<br>
But it is uncertain if he ever even saw President John Tyler or Secretary of State Daniel Webster, let alone talking to them, although the distinct possibility is there.  The oft-repeated story that he kept Oregon Territory from being traded off for a cod-fishery and the well known picture showing Webster,  Tyler, and Whitman together, the latter wearing a coon-skin cap, and pointing to a large map, and exclaiming "Don't give it up," rests upon no valid historical evidence.<br>
In fact there is no historical foundation whatsoever to show that he had anything to do with the decision to fix the boundary of the Oregon country where it was later established.  Nor is there any valid reason to suppose that he made his famous ride for any other reason than to attempt to secure a modification of the Board's order closing the two mission stations.<br>
<br>
In short there is no reason to believe that his trip east had the slightest effect upon any governmental policy in regard to Oregon.<br>
<br>
When the emigration of 1843-generally known as the Great Migration started west, Whitman was with it, as a member of one of the parties, but not as the leader or organizer of the migration itself.  Whitman was not an original member of any one of the various groups that made up the great migration but he probably found little difficulty in -attaching himself to one, since as a physician and a person experienced on the trail he would be a valuable member of any group.<br>
<br>
This great migration, the largest that had ever crossed the plains up until that time, left Independence and made the westward journey without experiencing anything more than the normal hardships and vicissitudes commonly associated with such a journey.<br>
<br>
Following the attempted assault on the person of Mrs. Whitman, McKinlay, at Fort Walla Walla, had become increasingly concerned for her safety, and on the eleventh of October had gone to the mission and insisted that she return to the fort for protection.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Whitman went along willingly at his insistence, although McKinlay was apparently prepared to use force had he considered it necessary since he felt that he could not assume the responsibility of allowing her to remain where she was without protection and he could not guarantee adequate protection anywhere except at the fort.<br>
<br>
That McKinlay was correct in his assumption is shown by the fact that after her departure several acts of vandalism around the mission were committed, and -the Indians later admitted that these, including the burning of the grist-mill, were deliberate; the mill being destroyed because of the fact that it was used t? supply flour and meal to the immigrants.<br>
<br>
The Indians were very much disturbed over the great number of settlers that were coming in and professed to believe that Whitman had gone east for soldiers.  Dr. Elijah White, in his capacity as subagent for Indian affairs, investigated the situation and attempted- to quiet the Cayuse by getting them to agree to a set of rules and regulations, which they refused to do.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Whitman, after spending some time at Fort Walla Walla went down the Columbia and visited the Methodist mission stations at The Dalles and in the Willamette Valley.  She also spent some time
at Fort Vancouver.  This was the only real vacation, the only real period of rest and relaxation, that Narcissa Whitman enjoyed while in the Pacific northwest.<br>
<br>
Events now hastened toward their tragic climax with all the inevitability of a Greek tragedy.  The Indians, fearful of being dispossessed of their land by the ever growing tide of white settlers, were intensified in their fears and hatreds by the efforts of agitators and trouble-makers from the outside.<br>
<br>
One of these was Tom Hill, a-Delaware Indian who had settled among the Nez Perce,.and who told both the Nez Perce and the Cayuse what had happened to his tribesmen in the east ' Although he lived among the Nez Perce his influence was greatest among the Cayuse, who seem to ha@e reasoned that their turn would ,come next unless some form of preventive action was taken.<br>
<br>
He spoke English fluently and even made a trip to the coast, making speeches and telling the Indians in no uncertain terms what the final result would be if the whites were permitted to take over any of the Indian lands.  His knowledge of English was such that he was able to argue with the missionaries as to the way the Indians had been treated in the eastern part of the United States and to bring                                                   forward arguments which were often difficult to answer.<br>
<br>
He was especially critical of the Protestant missionaries although on good terms with the Catholic fathers of whose influence Whitman was becoming increasingly fearful.  In 1845 McKinlay was transferred from Fort Walla Walla to have charge of the Hudson's Bay Company store at Oregon City and was succeeded by William McBean, a Catholic.<br>
<br>
From this time on Whitman seems to have come more and more to the conclusion that the task of saving the souls of the Indians and making them over into copper-colored replicas of the white men<br>
was impossible and that greater attention should be given to those measures which would bring about the colonization of the region by American Protestant settlers.<br>
<br>
Accordingly he became less and less concerned with the religious and more and more concerned with the secular affairs of the mission.<br>
<br>
But in 1845 a significant change occurred, for many of the people in that great emigration followed the Umatilla River to the Columbia-which was a more direct route and which did not even come near the Whitman mission station at Waiilatpu.  From this time on his station was little more than a detour on the Oregon Trail.<br>
<br>
The souls of the Indians were not being saved, they were continuing their old practices and incantations; the school which had been intended for the education of the Indian children was
largely unattended except for the children of the people stationed at the mission, plus a few other children.<br>
<br>
After 1844 the direct emigrant route missed the mission so that it lost a great deal of its importance as a way station on the road to Oregon.  But a good many of the emigrants did continue to make use of the mission, especially the indigent, the sick and  the  unfortunate, who had to postpone the final stage of their journey.<br>
<br>
At the mission they could rest and recuperate, and put everything in order for the trip down the river.  In the summer of 1845 Whit-
man had visited Fort Vancouver and discussed with the Hudson's Bay Company men his troubles with the Indians.  Many of the company employees had warned him of his danger, so that there is not the slightest doubt that Whitman knew of the risk that he was taking in remaining where he was.<br>
<br>
And the fact that he was in danger was also brought to the attention of the officials of the American Board i; Boston by no less a person than Peter Skene Ogden, who apparently visited Boston for that specific purpose.<br>
<br>
Although Whitman was a doctor of medicine, he had practiced the healing art very little among the Indians because of their well-known belief that if a person died while under the care of the medicine man, the family of the deceased was entitled to take revenge on the person of the medicine man even to the point of taking his life.<br>
<br>
Both of the Whitmans had been very careful and very reluctant to treat any of the natives since each realized the chances that they would be taking, but they had gradually broken down this reluctance and begun to treat a few individuals who had requested treatment.<br>
<br>
The chief afflictions from which the Indians suffered were sore eyes, from the glare of the sun on snow and water, from gastrointestinal disorders induced from gluttony and the fact that with them it was either feast or famine; and from respiratory ailments caused from their constant exposure to all kinds of weather.<br>
<br>
The situation was one made to order for a demagogue and he appeared about the middle of October, 1847, in the person of Joilewis, a half-breed who had come in sick and destitute with the emigrant train of that year from Fort Hall.  Whitman soon learned that he was stirring up trouble among the Cayuse and attempted to get rid of him by getting him a job with some of the emigrants who were bound down the Columbia.<br>
<br>
Lewis left the mission but in a few days was back spreading his demoralizing propaganda among the Indians, a task in which he was
aided by one Nicholas Finley, another half-breed, who had once been an employee of the Hudson's Bay Company and who had been hired by Whitman to work at the mission during the winter along with Joe Stanfield, a French-Canadian.<br>
<br>
The immigration of that year had brought in a great deal of disease -and sickness, particularly dysentery and measles, both diseases to which the Indians were particularly susceptible since they had never had the opportunity to build up an immunity or resistance.<br>
<br>
These caused a large mortality among the Indians-and also among the whites-and prepared the ground for the statements of Joe Lewis that Whitman was deliberately and systematically poisoning the Indians in order to acquire their lands for the white settlers.  Drury says that all accounts of Joe -Lewis picture him as a "treacherous, unprincipled scoundrel" and it is probably an understatement rather than an exaggeration.<br>
<br>
But the Indians knew that smallpox had been introduced among some of the tribes in order to decimate and control them-the<br>
threat of introducing this dread disease had been made at Astoria-so that Joe Lewis' argument had plausibility.  In addition Whitman had used poison in meat to destroy wolves and other four-footed marauders, and the Indians often found the meat and ate it, with disagreeable although not fatal results.<br>
<br>
Gray had often used a cathartic on melons since the Indians usually ate them rind, seeds, and all, and they got violently sick as a result.  To all of these things Joe Lewis could point as instances to support his argument.<br>
<br>
On the twenty-seventh of November, Whitman and Spalding made the journey to Umatilla where they visited the Catholic mission.  The day before, at Fort Walla Walla, Spalding had protested the use of the "Catholic Ladder" which he said endangered the lives of all the Protestant missionaries in the region.<br>
<br>
At Umatilla, Whitman, who was very much discouraged, and who may have known that his life was in danger, talked of selling Waiilatpu to the Catholics.  On the way down, Spalding's horse had fallen with him and injured Spalding's leg so that when Whitman left to return to his mission that night, Spalding remained behind.<br>
<br>
Before departing Whitman was told that he was going to be killed -and may have been told who was the potential assassin.  After arriving at Waiilatpu he apparently told Mrs. Whitman and Mr. Rodgers of what he had been told, but he- made no effort to warn the immigrant families who were there.<br>
<br>
There were several of these families at the mission and enough men
among them to have waged a desperate resistance if they had any intimation of the coming tragedy.  That Whitman did not warn them and thus give them a chance for their lives must be one count of the indictment against him, although it may very well be that he felt that the enmity of the Indians was directed at him alone and that the others would not be harmed.<br>
<br>
During the day the natives gradually infiltrated the mission yard where a beef was being butchered, always a matter of interest to the Indians.  The exact circumstances of the murder itself are, naturally, not definitely known.  Whitman may have been struck down with a tomahawk or he may have been shot, the weight of probability would seem to be in favor of the former.<br>
<br>
As one early writer has observed, since there were nearly one hundred persons present it would have been impossible for any one to have seen all or nearly all of what transpired.,, Some of the others in the house, including Mrs. Whitman, were wounded in the attack that now developed, and took refuge in the attic.  They were persuaded to leave this place of refuge under a safe conduct promise, a promise that their lives would be spared but that since it was the intention to burn the house, they would have to leave.<br>
<br>
Once outside the Indians began firing at the little party and several persons were killed including Mrs. Whitman.<br>
<br>
Two of the immigrants escaped and while one, by the name of Hall, made his way to Lapwai, the other, Canfield, carried the news of the massacre to Fort Walla Walla. At the latter place, McBean, who was fully aware of some of the potentialities inherent in the situation, immediately started a messenger downstream to Fort Vancouver with the news of the tragedy.<br>
<br>
That evening Father Brouillet arrived at the Cayuse camp and learned of what had happened.  Consternation is too mild a term with which to describe his reaction.<br>
<br>
The next morning he baptized several sick Indian children whose recovery was doubtful and then went to the Whitman mission where he helped inter the bodies.  Shortly after leaving there, en route to Umatilla, he met Spalding who was on his way to Waiilatpu.  It was due to this warning from Father Brouillet that Spalding was able to make his escape.<br>
<br>
Although pursued by the vengeful Cayuse, he succeeded in making his way to Lapwai.  On the journey he suffered many hardships including the loss of his horse and arrived to find his home in flames.  His family however was later discovered to be safe, having been given protection and shelter by friendly Nez Perces.<br>
The latter were much more realistic than the Cayuse and Spalding's teachings had had much greater effect among them than Whitman's had had among their neighboring tribesmen.  The Nez Perce felt that the white man was too strong to be. successfully resisted, and although a few of the younger warriors, in their quest for excitement joined the hostages, the great majority of the tribe remained studiously -aloof and refused to take any part in the Cayuse campaign to drive the white man out of the country.<br>
<br>
Their point of view was that the Cayuse were responsible for any misfortunes that came to them, that they should accept that responsibility and not attempt to bring in other tribes to share in their trials and troubles.<br>
<br>
The news reached Fort Vancouver on the sixth of December.  Of the seventy-two persons who had been at Waiilatpu, the Indians had killed fourteen, all of them men with the exception of Mrs. Whitman.  The remainder, mostly women and children, were held captive and it was to rescue these that the Hudson's Bay Company immediately@ launched a rescue expedition.<br>
<br>
Although the Americans were in political ownership of the region, the real authority was still exercised by the British corporation- At Vancouver James Douglas -and Peter Skene Ogden were the Chief Factors, and responsible for the decision that was made.  There was apparently no hesitation in making that decision, and Ogden who had a great deal of experience among the natives of the northwest, and knew their temperament and character as no other man of the day, was decided on as the man to lead the expedition.<br>
<br>
The alacrity with which he acted, and probably for the reason that fie felt that speed was the essence of the problem, is shown by the fact that the news arrived at Fort Vancouver on the sixth, and that early the next morning Ogden was on his way.<br>
<br>
In the meantime the Cayuse chiefs had become very much alarmed at the consequences of what they had done.  It was simply another case of performing an act in haste and then having plenty of leisure in which to repent it.  They had apparently expected that both the Nez Perce and Spokane Indians would join them in a war of extermination against the whites and to drive out the missionaries, and now belatedly discovered that neither tribe had the slightest intention of doing so.<br>
<br>
The Cayuse were to be allowed to face the vengeance of the American settlers single handed and alone.  In their consternation and fear they sought the counsel of Bishop Blanchet and at their request he prepared a statement requesting a peace conference and offering to surrender the captives, an idea which also was suggested to him by the Nez Perce.  In this communication the chiefs requested:
First.  That the Americans may not go to war with the Cayuses.<br>
<br>
Second.  That they may forget the lately committed murders, as the Cayuses will forget the murder of the son of the great chief of the Walla Wallas, committed in California.<br>
<br>
Third.  That two or three great men may come up to conclude peace.<br>
Fourth. That as soon as these great men have arrived and concluded peace, they may take with them all the women and children.<br>
<br>
Fifth: They give assurance that they will not harm the Americans before the arrival of these two or three great men.<br>
<br>
Sixth: They ask that Americans may not travel any more through their country, as the young men might do them harm'.<br>
<br>
This communication, which was dated the twentieth of December, 1847, at the place of Tauitowe, was signed by Tiloukaikt, Camaspelo, Tauitowe and Achekala. It was addressed to Governor Abernethy.<br>
<br>
Spalding, who apparently was frightened almost out of his wits, had written a letter to Bishop Blanchet in which he suggested that instead of troops a peace commission be sent to negotiate with the-Indians.  Blanchet, in a letter of his own, made the same suggestion on the ground that to send troops might precipate -a general Indian war, which was something that everyone hoped to avoid.<br>
<br>
These people all acted as they did and came up with the same suggestion for a whole variety of reasons, which although different were in essence a part of the Same reason, that they were individually and collectively "on a spot" of one kind or another, and were full y aware of the fact.<br>
<br>
The Cayuse knew that they had done something for which they deserved to be punished, but quite naturally they were anxious to avoid it entirely or to mitigate it as far as possible.  Spalding was a hostage and not a free agent and was anxious to escape from his captivity at almost any cost; he did not want a war to start until he was beyond the reach of the Indians.<br>
<br>
Bishop Blanchet must have realized, in fact could hardly help but realize, that public opinion would assign a real share of the responsibility for the massacre to the rivalry and <B>thee </B>comparatively bad relations- existing between the different groups  of missionaries, and that' since the Catholics were Popularly identified with the British and the Hudson's Bay Company party in the dispute over Oregon, they would, despite the fact that the
boundary controversy had already been settled, be held by many to have been directly responsible for the tragedy.<br>
<br>
In the meantime the party led by Peter Skene Ogden had left Fort Vancouver on the seventh of December in a boat with sixteen paddlers, packed with a large quantity of trade goods, their purpose being to ransom and secure the release of the hostages held by the Cayuse: For fear of alarming the Indians along the river, McBean's messenger had been instructed to give the news to no one before reaching Fort Vancouver, and now for the same reason, Ogden's party made no unusual attempt at haste.  There was no appearance of being in a hurry, they stopped overnight at the usual places of a brigade bound upstream, and they paid the usual tribute to the Indians at the various portages.<br>
<br>
After a completely  uneventful voyage, they  arrived at Fort Walla Walla on the nineteenth and Ogden immediately sent word to the Cayuse chiefs asking them to meet him in council, and also requesting that Bishop Blanchet attend.  The meeting at Umatilla had just broken up and the Indians were in a mood to listen to anyone who they thought would be able to help them out of the predicament that they fully realized that they were in.<br>
<br>
They knew and respected Ogden, who at this time was at the height<br>
of his fame and reputation as a fur trader, and they were willing to listen <B>to </B>what he had to say.<br>
<br>
Known among the Indians as "the Old Whitehead," and among the canoe men and servants of the company as "M'sieu Pete," from al-
most any point of view no better person could have been selected for the difficult task of ransoming the captives than he.-<br>
<br>
Speaking of the Hudson's Bay Company, Ogden, in his speech to the Indians, is reported to have said:<br>
<br>
We have been among you for thirty years without the shedding of blood; we are traders, and of a different nation from the Americans, who are of the same color, speak the same language and worship the same God as ourselves, and whose cruel rate causes our hearts to bleed.<br>
<br>
Why do we make you chiefs, if you cannot control your young men? Besides this wholesale butchery you have robbed the Americans passing through your country, and have insulted their women. if you allow your young men to govern you, I say you are not men or chiefs but hermaphrodites who do not deserve the name.  Your hotheaded young men plume themselves on their bravery, but let them not deceive themselves.<br>
<br>
If the Americans begin war they will have cause to repent their rashness; for the war will not end until every man of you is cut off from the face of the earth! I am aware that many of your people have died; but so have many others.  It was not Doctor
Whitman who poisoned them; but God who has commanded that they should die.<br>
<br>
You have the opportunity to make some reparation.  I give you only advice and promise you nothing should war be declared against you. The company has nothing with your quarrel. If you wish it, on my return I will see what can be done for you, but I do not promise to prevent war. Deliver me the     prisoners to return to their friends, and I will pay you a ransom; that is all.<br>
<br>
To this Tiloukaikt replied:<br>
<br>
Chief, your words are weighty, your hairs are gray.  We have known you a long time.  You have had an unpleasant journey to this place.  I cannot keep the families back.  I make them over to you, which I would not do to another younger than yourself.<br>
<br>
The ransom paid by the Hudson's Bay Company consisted of sixty-five blankets and twelve guns, besides supplies of shirts, handkerchiefs, ammunition, flints, and tobacco, some of the articles going to the Nez Perce because they had charge of Spalding and his party at Lapwai.<br>
<br>
On the twenty-ninth the white captives who had been held at Waiilatpu were taken to Fort Walla Walla, and on the first day of January of the new year, Spalding and his party arrived, escorted by the Nez Perce.<br>
<br>
The next day at noon the boats left for the voyage downstream.  Ogden later wrote: "For two nights I have not slept, but, thank God, they are all safe and none have been molested. The trip consumed six days and was without significant incident.<br>
<br>
Bishop Blanchet went with them.  Two days after their arrival Ogden turned over the captives to the officials of the American Provisional Government and the Hudson's Bay Company ceased to have any official connection with the affair.  It might be noted in passing that the company was never recompensed for the<br>
expense that it incurred rescuing the captives.<br>
<br>
No compensation was ever made for the trade goods that had been furnished to the Indians, nor for the wages of the men involved @n the relief expedition, men who had been diverted from their regular tasks and occupations in order to participate in the rescue.<br>
<br>
Not only was the Hudson's Bay Company never compensated for any of the expense which it had incurred, it never even presented a bill.  It is simply another illustration of the fact that the company considered that blood was thicker than water.<br>
<br>
While there was certainly some self-interest involved since the Company officials at Fort Vancouver knew that in an incident such
as this, with the white women -and children allowed to remain as the prisoners of the Indians, that no white settler or trapper would ever be safe in the interior of the country.<br>
<br>
Since they represented law and order to the Indians it was incumbent upon them to bring about a rescue.  The rescue of the captives was a noble humanitarian act and one performed without the slightest hope of compensation or reward.<br>
<br>
Ogden apparently got his passengers away from Fort Walla Walla just in the nick of time.  Rumors had reached the Indians of the military preparations that were being made against them by the American settlers in the Willamette Valley, in fact Ogden had not been too far ahead of the first company of volunteers when he went upstream.<br>
<br>
The Indians were very much disturbed by these rumors, and shortly after the departure of the boats a force of Cayuse warriors rode up to Fort Walla Walla and demanded the surrender of Spalding, only to find that he had escaped a short time before.  The apparent idea was to hold him as a hostage against any punitive action by the Americans.<br>
<br>
Spalding, who seems to have been willing to promise almost everything and anything in order to gain his freedom (he had even given his word to the Cayuse that there would be no reprisals for the murder of the Whitmans)- recovered his courage in exact proportion as the distance between him and Fort Vancouver lessened.<br>
<br>
The farther he got from the scene of the massacre the more belligerent he became, and by the time that he reached the mission at ne Dalles, he was demanding that the government embark on a war of extermination against the whole Cayuse tribe.<br>
<br>
In view of this, as well as his earlier utterances and actions, his later statements <B>in </B>regard to the work of the mission, the massacre, its causes, and all things connected with it, are to be taken with a much larger grain of salt than is customary.<br>
<br>
The way in which the captives were treated by the Indians is a subject that is hotly disputed, and on which there is little possibility of agreement.  Spalding's later account's, which furnish the basis of most accounts, were extremely hysterical, and apparently designed to.gratify the sensations of a thrill-seeking audience rather than to present a picture of historical truth.<br>
<br>
It should be remembered that the lot of a prisoner of war is seldom a happy one and that this is especially true when the captor is of a different race and of a lower decree of civilization than is the captive.<br>
The women captives were annoyed but probably the fear of molestation was greater than the actual experience of it.  At least one marriage between a captive woman and an Indian resulted, and there probably would have been at least two more had it not for circumstances which had nothing to do with the massacre or the fact that the women were captives.<br>
<br>
While, for none of the women was the experience a pleasant one, it was not -as unpleasant or as degrading as it could have been, or as that endured by captive women in the hands of soldiers of more civilized countries, both before and since.<br>
<br>
At the time of the massacre Oregon Territory was still controlled by the Provisional Government since Congress had taken no steps to organize the territory, although the boundary dispute had been settled the year before.<br>
<br>
On the seventh of December the legislature met at Oregon City, and the next morning its seventeen members listened to the message of Governor Abernethy in which he called their attention to the need of curbing the depredations of the Indians if the territory was to be made attractive to white settlers.  It was a singularly appropriate message for that afternoon the Governor had the un-
pleasant duty of communication to the legislature the news of the massacre at Waiilatpu, news which he had just received from Sir James Douglas who was in charge at Fort Vancouver.<br>
<br>
But the legislature acted with alacrity and by noon of the next day a company of riflemen had been raised and equiped, .<br>
and was ready to march.- It moved upstream only a few days behind Peter Skene Ogden and his rescue expedition, but it went only as far as the mission at The Dalles, where it was expected that a further attack might be made and where the news of its presence was to be a complicating factor in Ogden's efforts to rescue the captives.<br>
<br>
Additional volunteers were enrolled, in all five companies being recruited, including one of French-Canadians under Thomas McKay, who later were to take a cannon around Mt.  Hood in a furious snow storm.  The system then in vogue in the United States for volunteer troops was followed in Oregon, each recruit supplying his own horse, arms, and equipment, privates and non-commissioned officers being paid one dollar and a half per day.  The troops also chose their own company officers.<br>
<br>
The Colonel was Cornelius Gilliam, who had been born in North Carolina but raised in Missouri and had had a varied military career.  He had served in both the Black Hawk and Seminole Indian wars and had been a captain under Zachary Taylor.  He had also been a member of the Missouri legislature and had also served as a captain of volunteers in the fighting that had culminated in the expulsion of the Mormons from the state of Missouri.  In 1844 he had led a large group of settlers to Oregon in the migration of
that year.<br>
<br>
At the time of the Whitman massacre he was serving as the minister of a Baptist Church in Polk County where he had established a farm.  Like many others of his day he was bigoted and narrow -
minded in religious matters and was ready and willing to believe that the Indians had been incited by the Catholics and by the Hudson's Bay Company.<br>
<br>
The news of the massacre had to be sent to Washington, and also to California since Oregon Territory had no finances or resources for fighting any kind of a war.  On the ninth of December, the Treasurer had submitted a report which showed $43-72 in the treasury, and scrip, representing obligations outstanding against the Territory, to the amount of $4,123-46.31 The outfitting of the various companies of riflemen had been done with money and supplies raised from a variety of places.<br>
<br>
The Hudson's Bay Company could not make any -advances to the Territory as such, but it did advance about one thousand dollars on a note given by the Governor of the Territory and two of the commissioners as private individuals.  About twenty-six hundred<br>
dollars was advanced by the merchants and citizens of Oregon City while the Methodist Mission contributed another one thousand dollars.<br>
<br>
But the major portion of the military stores and subsistence needed for the campaign was raised by requisitions on the settlers themselves, and the war was brought to a successful conclusion on that basis.  No additional or higher taxes were levied.  It has been pointed out that this policy of financing a war solely on credit, by a government already deeply involved, was not disastrous solely because of the patriotic spirit of the settlers, who recognized what needed to be done, and who proceeded to do it."<br>
<br>
As previously related Joe Meek was selected to carry the news to Washington and he accompanied the troops when they moved up the Columbia, When they arrived at Waillatpu on the fourth of March, he left with a few companions travelling over the Oregon Trail arrayed in caps and coats furnished by the Hudson's Bay Company, since British subjects were a great deal safer in crossing the plains than were Americans.<br>
<br>
Governor Abernethy had suggested that Meek make the trip east by way of California thus serving a double purpose and acting as messenger to both California and the national capital, but Meek had refused to do this, so the southern trip was assigned to Jesse Applegate and several others, who were stopped by the deep snows of the Siskiyou Mountains and who did not get through to California until spring.  Meek reached St. Louis on the seventeenth of May after a difficult and hazardous trip.
But before any significant aid was forthcoming from the national government, the settlers of Oregon had fought the Cayuse War and succeeded in. bringing some of those responsible for the murder of Whitman and the others to justice.  The task was not an easy one for there were divided councils and the Provisional Government had attempted to carry water on both shoulders.<br>
<br>
For this attempt there was, however, considerable justification since the settlers knew only too well the consequences of a general Indian war and hoped to avoid one if possible.  As far as they were concerned the single purpose of the expedition was to apprehend the murderers.  This was made official in the form of orders which Colonel Gilliam received on his arrival at The Dalles on the journey upstream.<br>
<br>
Surrender of the murderers and restitution of the stolen property was all that they hoped to accomplish.  Had these two things been accomplished early there would have been no war.  To the end of bringing this about, a Peace Commission was appointed to accompany the army.  This commission was headed by General Joel Palmer, United State's Superintendent of Indian Affairs for Oregon and Commissary General, and also included Robert Newell and Major H. A. G. Lee.<br>
<br>
They were to go along with the troops, and carry on negotiations with the Indians if such were at all possible, to the end that the objects of the campaign might be accomplished with as little actual fighting as possible.  This Commission had been appointed before the suggestion of Bishop Blanchet that such a course of action be followed had been received, all of which illustrates how desirous nearly everyone concerned was of avoiding an Indian war.<br>
<br>
Operations in the field were extremely difficult  owing  to  the   distance of the theater of operations from the settlements and the difficulties of transportation.  The Cayuse country was some three hundred miles from the settlements in the Willamette Valley and the only means of transport and communication was the Columbia River which had several portages.<br>
<br>
The first company to move out consisted of about fifty officers and men who were on the way to The Dalles within twenty-four hours after the receipt of the first news of the massacre.  Since it was believed that another attack-if it came, would come there,-the troops were ordered to hold that place and resist attack -and await reinforcements.<br>
<br>
The other companies were started upstream as soon as their organization and outfitting had been completed.  A base of operations was established at the Cascades which was named Fort
Gilliam, but which consisted merely of a few cabins and was neither a blockhouse nor a stockade.  Farther upstream at The Dalles a stockade was constructed and given the name of Fort Lee.<br>
<br>
There were a few inconclusive skirmishes with the Indians in which casualties were suffered on both sides.  The instructions given to the Peace Commissioners did not fit in with Colonel Gilliam's some what belligerent disposition.  The Colonel, who was a good hater and violently anti-Catholic and anti-British, is said to have threatened <B>to pull </B>Fort Vancouver down around the heads of its inmates, and there seem to have been those among his associates who feared that he would attempt to carry his threat into execution.<br>
<br>
The expedition seemed to have two varied objectives and no one was exactly.sure just which one did have precedence.  But the Peace Commission was insistent that the Indians must be informed that the only objectives of the campaign were to punish the murderers, to secure a restoration of all property stolen and the assurance from the Indians that American emigrants would be allowed to pass through the country and down the Columbia River  without being made the object of molestation and attack.<br>
<br>
Given the anxiety of the settlers to avoid a general war, and the well-known character of the Cayuse Indians for chicanery and double-dealing, these instructions opened the way for some interesting developments, for trickery and deceit, for temporizing and delay.<br>
<br>
Taking, advantage of the discretion allowed him by his orders, Colonel Gilliam decided to move his entire command to Walilatpu with the exception of a small detail of about twenty men which was to be left at The Dalles.  So, with the Peace Commission in advance, the army moved forward with the Cayuse hovering on both flanks but not daring to make an open attack.<br>
<br>
The Peace Commissioners had sent letters to Mr. McBean at Fort Walla Walla, and one to the Nez Perce from Spalding in which they set forth plainly the reasons for the troops advancing up the river.  But the Cayuse had captured the messengers, and although they sent the message on to McBean, they confiscated all the presents that tad accompanied it.<br>
<br>
Spalding's letter was not sent on, but two Nez Perce chiefs happened to be at Fort Walla Walla when McBean received his communication and they carried the news to their tribe.  To this the neutrality of the Nez Perce may have been due.  The replies from McBean were also intercepted and confiscated, and but for that the murderers would probably have been surrendered early in the conflict.
Arriving at Fort Walla Walla the troops found that things were not nearly as bad as they might have been.  There had been no further attacks on any of the mission stations; Walker, Eells, and the Catholic missionaries were all safe, and no other tribes had as yet joined the Cayuse- Arrived at Waaiilatpu the troops were appalled at the evidences of the senseless vandalism of the Cayuse tribe.<br>
<br>
The sight of the bones of the dead which had been dug up by the wolves and scattered about, sickened even experienced campaigners and made the troops more determined than ever to exact vengeance.  Colonel Gilliam was particularly incensed by what he saw.  Papers, letters, books, and other miscellaneous materials were scattered about, and much of the farm equipment of the station had been burned along with the buildings.<br>
<br>
Most of the documents were merely looked at and then destroyed, which beyond doubt was a great mistake for their preservation would have added to our knowledge of the causes of the Whitman massacre.- Here Colonel Gilliam constructed another fort to which he gave the name of Fort Waters, after the Lieutenant Colonel of the regiment, but intended movement against the hostiles was delayed  by trickery and by stalling tactics on the part of the Indians.<br>
<br>
They asked for a council and then introduced suggestions which they knew were unacceptable  and  which  were brought forward merely for the purpose of starting an argument.  Finally in the field, Colonel Gilliam pursued the hostiles, but they always succeeded in escaping.<br>
<br>
The army was now running short of supplies so Gilliam left half of his force at Fort Waters while with the remainder he started for The Dalles to  procure supplies and to acquaint Governor Abernethy with the progress of events to date.  Not far from the Umatilla River he was killed by the accidental discharge of a gun, and was succeeded by Major Lee, who was given the appointment by the Governor over the head of Lieutenant   Colonel  Waters.<br>
<br>
An additional three hundred volunteers were called for and sent on to Fort Waters.  Arriving at Waaiilatpu, Lee, recognizing that the over-all command properly should have gone to Lieutenant Colonel Waters, resigned his new appointment and turned over the command.<br>
<br>
Another campaign failed to catch the Cayuse for the plain and simple reason that they were much better acquainted with the country and so were able to keep out of the way of the troops.<br>
<br>
There was also the fact that the members of other tribes 'while
not a aiding the Cayuse, were reluctant to furnish any information about and generally remained silent until the Cayuse were well out of reach of the soldiers.<br>
<br>
Although not actively siding with the Cayuse, they at least gave the latter aid and comfort by keeping them informed of where the troops were and what they were doing, and in general of what was going on.<br>
<br>
It was the recognition of these many advantages which the Indians possessed, plus the fact that crops were maturing ' g at home and that the presence of the volunteers was needed to take cars of their homes and farms' that brought the government to the -conclusion that the campaign must be ended.  But there was no intention on the part of anyone to allow the murderers to escape.<br>
<br>
The Cayuse lands were declared forfeited, and arms and ammunition were to be withheld from all Indians, even from the friendliest lest it find its way to the outlaws.  In this way it was kept from the hostiles who were forced to remain in hiding in the mountains, and who could as a result never remain long in one place, being kept constantly on the move.  A force of volunteers also remained at Waiilatpu in order to guard against any attempt of the Cayuse to return.<br>
<br>
And they were told that they could expect no rest until the murderers had been surrendered and the other demands of the settlers complied with.  The missionaries were not to operate missions without the specific permission of the United States government.<br>
<br>
This was the situation when Governor Joseph Lane arrived -and took over the political supervision and administration of Oregon Territory.  In May, 1849, he went to Fort Nisqually, north of the river, because of an outbreak of the Snoqualamie tribe under Chief Patkanim, and had other affairs to distract his attention.<br>
<br>
But the matter of the Whitman murderers was always unfinished business, and the policy of keeping the pressure on the tribe finally paid off when five of tie Cayuse Indians wanted for the killing finally came in voluntarily and surrendered.<br>
<br>
These five were Tiloukaikt, Tamahas, Klokamas, Isaiachalakis, and Kiamasumpkin;s, and they apparently acted as they did in the hope of securing peace and freedom from wandering for their people.<br>
<br>
Judged by even modern standards the trial, which was set for the 22nd of May, seems to have been eminently fair, although there might be a question as to whether the Court which tried them really had jurisdiction over their case.<br>
Considerable care was shown in the selection of the jury, and the accused were given adequate counsel.  Amory Holbrook, the United States District Attorney, prosecuted while Kintzing Pritchard, the territorial secretary, R. B. Reynolds and Thomas Claiborne, Jr., appeared for the defense.<br>
<br>
The latter had been captain of one of the rifle regiments. Old settlers and others who might be expected to have an ingrained prejudice against Indians were barred from the jury, and the counsel representing the accused were allowed to present their case competently and adequately.<br>
<br>
The defense based its argument chiefly on the ground that on the day of the massacre the laws of the United States had not been extended over the territory of Oregon.  This legal technicality was ruled out by Judge 0. C. Pratt, who then proceeded to deny a defense motion for a change of venue.<br>
<br>
In its argument to the jury the defense contended that the massacre had been brought about by a combination of circumstances-which was certainly true-and that due to the confused and even contradictory evidence given by the witnesses for the prosecution there was no positive proof that the accused were the actual murderers, and that the death of their wives and children, by what the Indians believed <B>to</B> be the deliberate intention of Dr. Whitman, constituted at least a small degree of extenuation.<br>
<br>
But the jury brought in a verdict of guilty and Judge Pratt sentenced all five to be put to death by hanging, a sentence which obviously was somewhat excessive in at least one case.<br>
<br>
None of the witnesses had testified to seeing Kiamasumpkin kill any of the victims of the massacre but it was<br>
felt that his giving himself up was at least the equivalent of a confession so he was convicted and ordered executed along with the others. (This was at least an early example of guilt by association.)<br>
<br>
Attempts to secure a new trial failed and while there was some talk of a reprieve while an appeal was taken to the Supreme Court of the United States, nothing came of it with the result that the execution was carried out as ordered.<br>
<br>
A gallows was erected and Joe Meek, whose daughter had died at the Whitman mission before the captives were ransomed, acted as executioner.  Many persons came armed on the day of the execution, which was apparently a public spectacle, in the fear that an attempt at the forcible delivery of the captives might be made, but the condemned went to their death quietly.<br>
<br>
The prisoners received the last rites of the Catholic Church from Father Veyret just before they were launched into eternity, a fact
that probably confirmed many of the Protestant settlers of the Willamette Valley in the belief that the massacre of Whitman and his associates had been a Catholic plot.  Hanging was especially abhorrent to Indians.<br>
<br>
They considered it an especially degrading way to die and seem to have surrendered in the belief that the death penalty, if inflicted, would be by shooting.  On the scaffold one of them, Kiamasumpkin, is said to have begged Meek to stab him but the latter's only answer was to release the trap.  So perished the murderers of Marcus Whitman, and the ends of justice were held to have been satisfied.<br>
<br>
But <B>in </B>many ways it was an empty victory for the American settlers, since neither Tamsucky, who many believed to have been the actual murderer of Whitman, and who certainly was a focal point in the organization of the discontent that culminated in the massacre, or Joe Lewis, who might be termed the catalytic agent that set off the whole explosion, and who probably killed  Narcissa Whitman,  had  been  apprehended  or  punished.<br>
<br>
Indeed  the  latter seems never to have been heard of again.  But within five years the once proud and insolent Cayuse tribe had surrendered its lands in Eastern Washington and moved to the Umatilla Reservation, where it disappeared as an important factor in Indian affairs.<br>
<br>
Whitman not only was avenged in the of the five conspirators, but more fittingly in the fact that the cause of which he had dedicated himself and for which he had given his life, that of seeing the country fill up with American settlers, was being rapidly advanced.<br>
<br>
Although by no stretch of the imagination can Whitman be credited with saving Oregon, since that was the accomplishment of a good many men working over a period of many years, his position in history is secure, as his selection for the Hall of Fame indicates.  He does not need to be given credit for something that he did not do.<br>
<br>
Whether he actually made his famous ride to save Oregon for the United States is immaterial.  His services to the region of the Pacific northwest are real and tangible, and of the kind that neither moth nor rust can corrupt or blemish.<br>

MOUNT HOOD TRAGEDY OF 1986.<br>
<br>
Jack Broom and Steve Bovey, "Pointing fingers in the Mount Hood Tragedy. Panel blames leader, parent blames school," <B>The Seattle Times.</B> July 25, 1986, p. A-1.<br>
<br>
Investigators say poor decisions by a faculty climbing leader led to nine deaths in a school-sponsored climb of Mount Hood in May _<br>
but one angry parent says top school administrators can't escape blame for the tragedy.<br>
<br>
``This was a school event. . . . This was the school's death<br>
march,'' Richard Haeder of Portland said last night. His 17-year-old son, Richard Jr., died on the mountain.<br>
<br>
Haeder's comments came after a five-member investigative<br>
committee said the Rev. Thomas Goman, his judgment impaired by cold and fatigue, pressed climbers from Oregon Episcopal School to continue far beyond the point where they should have turned back.<br>
<br>
``The prudent course of action'' would have been for the<br>
students to turn back at the 8,600-foot level _ about eight hours before they did, according to the committee.<br>
<br>
The report accused Goman of ``unsafe mountain practices'' in<br>
urging the group on despite general fatigue, illness and bad weather.<br>
<br>
Goman, along with one other faculty member and seven students,<br>
perished in the second-worst climbing disaster in the country's history.<br>
<br>
The five-member investigative committee, appointed by school<br>
officials, recommends a two-year moratorium on the school's Mount Hood climb, and lists a number of measures to improve the program's safety.<br>
<br>
But Haeder said the school is unfairly trying to place the blame<br>
on Goman instead of accepting responsibility for the incident.<br>
<br>
``No matter how many fingers you point at the dead, there's no<br>
way you're going to erase the school's responsibility,'' said Haeder.<br>
<br>
``It's almost criminal, the lack of supplies the school had them take,' he said, and also blamed school officials for not providing more trained guides for the outing.<br>
<br>
Haeder said he holds the school ``four-square responsible for
everything that happened on the mountain'' but would not say if he plans a lawsuit.<br>
<br>
Parents of some of the other victims were supportive of school<br>
officials and Goman.<br>
<br>
The priest was ``a seasoned leader of novice climbers, and very<br>
conservative,'' said Don McClave, father of Susan McClave, 18, whose body was found huddled with others in a snow cave on the mountain.<br>
<br>
Asked if a lawsuit may result from the incident, McClave said, ``I certainly hope there will not be. I don't know what purpose that<br>
would serve.''<br>
<br>
Another parent, Dick Sandvik, whose 16-year-old son, Eric, died<br>
after being found outside the snow cave, said, ``I'm certainly not<br>
inclined to harm the school. It provided my son with a lot of excellent benefits.''<br>
<br>
Goman's wife, Mar, said she doesn't dispute the committee's<br>
findings, but said, ``If Tom made decisions which reflected poor<br>
judgment, they were entirely out of character and inconsistent with his decision-making history. Everyone who knew Tom will remember him as a clear thinker, a committed friend and a conscientious leader.''<br>
<br>
The Mount Hood climb was an annual event for sophomores at<br>
Oregon Episcopal School and was part of the school's ``Basecamp''<br>
wilderness-experience program.<br>
<br>
Of the 19 climbers who started the hike at Timberline Lodge at 3<br>
a.m. on May 12, six turned back early because of illness or exhaustion.<br>
<br>
The rest climbed to above the 10,000-foot level by about 3 p.m. when they were turned back by poor weather conditions.<br>
<br>
At night, the climbers dug a snow cave for protection. The next<br>
day, one student, Molly Schula, and a guide, Ralph Summers, walked down the mountain to summon help.<br>
<br>
The following day, May 14, search parties found three climbers<br>
who had died from hypothermia. The other eight were found on May 15 in the snow cave. Only two, Brinton Clark and Giles Thompson, survived.<br>
<br>
After the incident, school officials appointed five committee<br>
members, including nationally recognized climbing experts, to<br>
investigate the tragedy and the Basecamp program.
<br>
Among its findings, the committee faulted the expedition's:<br>
<br>
Timing. ``One of the primary culprits in this accident was the<br>
need to try to adhere to a schedule,'' the report said. It said time pressure made the climbers unwilling to delay the expedition, even though the forecast called for bad weather.<br>
<br>
Equipment. The report says the climbers should have had better<br>
boots and clothing, more shovels and bivouac sacks and should have<br>
carried an altimeter and a topographical map of the mountain.<br>
<br>
Supervision. Investigators found a conflict between Goman's<br>
role and that of Summers, a trained guide whose job with the group was to be a ``technical assistant.'' The report says Summers knew some students wanted to turn back, but he deferred to Goman's leadership.<br>
<br>
The report also says that the ratio of two trained guides to 17 other climbers was insufficient.<br>

<br>
The Oregon Episcopal School has suspended its Basecamp<br>
Wilderness Education Program pending the outcome of an investigation into last spring's accident that killed nine climbers on Mount Hood.<br>
<br>
The school will resume the program early next year under a full-time director.<br>
<br>
Malcolm H. Manson, headmaster of the small private school in<br>
Portland, said yesterday that while the school will continue its<br>
commitment to wilderness education, it will suspend the wilderness<br>
program for six months. One goal of that program is for sophomore<br>
students to at least attempt to climb Mount Hood.<br>
<br>
Last spring, a climbing party became stuck in a snowstorm. Nine<br>
students and faculty members died of exposure on the mountain.
Following that accident, the school formed a committee of<br>
climbing experts to investigate. Findings are to be released July 31.<br>
<br>
Manson said the school was suspending the program now because it<br>
is too close to the start of the new school year to act on the<br>
committee's recommendations.<br>
<br>
`We want to take the most responsible and conservative approach<br>
to making any necessary changes,'' Manson said in a press release.<br>
Manson said the school will conduct a nationwide search for a<br>
full-time director for the Basecamp Program. He said the job description will be drafted based on the committee's findings.<br>

"Guide says leader pushed for summit in Hood tragedy," <B>Seattle  Times.</B> July 17, 1986, p. B-3.<br>
<br>
The guide on a climb up Mount Hood that ended in nine<br>
deaths has told the victims' families that the group's leader decided to push for the summit despite early problems, according to a report by a  Portland television station.<br>
<br>
In a copyright story broadcast last night by KGW-TV, the station<br>
narrated excerpts of a report on the ill-fated climb. The report was written by professional mountaineer Ralph Summers, who accompanied the group.<br>
<br>
The report, dated June 9, was issued by the Oregon Episcopal<br>
School to the families of seven students and two faculty members who died in Oregon's worst mountain-climbing accident. It has not been publicly released.<br>
<br>
The television station quoted Summers, 30, as saying he discussed<br>
with the Rev. Thomas Goman the option of turning back early in the May 12 ascent because another adult adviser, Marion Horwell, was having difficulty breathing.<br>
<br>
``She was not an experienced climber,'' Summers said. ``I<br>
discussed with Father Tom Goman the possibility of turning back or going on. It was Tom's decision to move on. Tom at least wanted to make a token effort to the summit.''<br>
<br>
Summers' report said the group finally turned back as one of the<br>
students, 15-year-old Patrick McGinness, began suffering from
hypothermia.<br>
<br>
In a raging spring blizzard, the group wrapped McGinness in a<br>
sleeping bag and another climber got inside to help warm him. Later, the boy was taken out of the sleeping bag, but he could not walk on his own.<br>
<br>
By early evening, Summers' report said, Summers had made the decision to spend the night on the 11,235-foot peak.<br>
<br>
Summers and 17-year-old student Molly Schula were able to reach<br>
help, but rescuers found only two survivors.<br>
<br>
Horwell's brother, Don Penater of Pacific City, was the only<br>
person to comment on Summers' report.<br>
<br>
Penater said today he still has some questions about what<br>
happened on the climb but will wait until the end of the month _ when the school is scheduled to release the results of its investigation into the accident _ before coming to any conclusions.<br>
<br>
That investigation is being conducted by four climbing experts, and Penater said he is confident that it will provide a detailed explanation of what went wrong on the climb.<br>
<br>
``I'm not an expert, and right now I only have my opinion,'' said<br>
Penater. ``But when the report comes out, it might stir up some stuff.''<br>
<br>
As in past years, Summers is again working for the Pacific Crest<br>
Outward Bound program in Portland.<br>
<br>
Vic Walsh, executive director of the program, said that Summers<br>
was hired before the Mount Hood accident to supervise two programs this summer. After the fatal climb, Walsh said he and Summers agreed that he should limit his involvement with Outward Bound to non-supervisory activities until all the facts are in on the Mount Hood tragedy.<br>

"SCHOOL FORMS PANEL TO PROBE MOUNT HOOD CLIMBING DISASTER," <B>The Seattle Times.</B> June 10, 1986 p. B-3.<br>
<br>
The school that sponsored the Mount Hood climbing expedition<br>
that claimed nine lives last month has formed an independent committee to investigate the disaster.<br>
<br>
The five-member committee, which will include mountaineering<br>
experts from around the country, has been asked to issue a report by July 31, Mariann Koop, spokeswoman for Oregon Episcopal School, said yesterday.<br>
<br>
Seven students and two faculty members died after a spring<br>
blizzard on the mountain east of Portland on May 12.<br>
<br>
``We all want to know what happened. The investigation will<br>
establish the facts and we will know,'' Koop said at a news conference.<br>
<br>
The committee will be headed by Jed Williamson of Hanover, N.H.,<br>
a board member of the American Alpine Club and a consultant in outdoor education, Koop said.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, the two 16-year-old climbers found alive in a snow<br>
cave continued to recover in Portland hospitals.<br>
<br>
Giles Thompson of Longview, Wash., remains in serious but stable<br>
condition at Providence Medical Center, but shows signs of improving, spokesman Dan LaGrande said.<br>
<br>
Brinton Clark of Portland remains in good condition at Emanuel<br>
Hospital's rehabilitation center, spokeswoman Shoshana Blauer said. No date for her release has been set.<br>

"CLIMBING EXPERTS RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT HOOD CLIMB," <B>The Seattle Times.</B> May 22, 1986, p. A-1.<br>
<br>
Even as students and faculty from the Oregon Episcopal School eulogized their dead today, some of the most respected mountaineers in the Northwest were questioning the circumstances and decisions that led to the deaths of nine climbers on Mount Hood last week.<br>
<br>
 
The mountaineering expert say accounts they have read of the<br>
hike don't square with what they think should have been done when the group encountered the snowstorm. They say the storm had been forecast and that the group should have been able to see it coming. They also question the wisdom of trying to wait out a storm in a shallow snow cave without food or heat.<br>
<br>
John O'Neill, general manager of Timberline Lodge, says a lodge<br>
employee warned one of the school hikers that the group shouldn't try to climb the mountain on Monday, telling her that they'd have to come rescue them the following day.<br>
<br>
Contrary to reports that the storm came up suddenly, weather<br>
forecasts had predicted a severe, extended storm. The top of the<br>
mountain was shrouded in clouds all day, and that the temperature was in the low 30s with 30 mph winds, O'Neill said.<br>
<br>
He said a two-man work crew from the lodge watched the climbing<br>
party hike into the clouds, and that they had made ``very slow<br>
progress'' during the early hours, and easiest portion, of the hike.<br>
<br>
The two questions mountaineers are asking most often are: Who<br>
was actually leading the climbing party, and why didn't they turn back earlier?<br>
<br>
A guide for Lou Whittaker's climbing school, Rainier Mountaineering Inc., canceled a trip up Mount Hood the day before the Oregon Episcopal School's climb because of bad weather and the extended<br>
forecast.<br>
<br>
Mike Volk, who operates Timberline Mountain Guides on Mount<br>
Hood, also canceled a scheduled climb because of the weather. Volk was also critical of the group's decision to dig into the side of the mountain rather than hike to safety.<br>
<br>
``I personally would not have done that,'' said Volk. ``I'd personally beat them down the mountain to get them out.''<br>
<br>
Ralph Summers, a guide who hiked down the mountain for help, and<br>
school officials could not be reached for comment, but he has said the school group stopped on the mountain because one of the hikers developed hypothermia. Summers has also said that the storm came up suddenly.<br>
<br>
Both Volk and Whittaker said they couldn't be too critical of<br>
Summers without actually knowing the conditions he was working under, and whether he or another adult member of the group was actually the person in charge.<br>
<br>
Whittaker, while refusing to place blame for the accident, was<br>
particularly critical of the explanation that the climbing party got hit by a surprise storm and was slowed down by a hiker with hypothermia.
<br>
Whittaker said bad weather is never a good excuse for accidents in the Cascade Mountains, and that experienced guides should always be watching for hypothermia.<br>
<br>
``I don't want to shoot anyone down without knowing all the facts, but there is no such thing as a surprise storm,'' said Whittaker.<br>
<br>
``There were indicators. And you don't get hypothermia real fast. It's no excuse to slow a party down because you don't extend yourself that far. You only climb with the strength of your weakest member.''<br>
<br>
Summers appears to have been the person in charge of the hike,<br>
and he appears to have had considerable experience on Mount Hood. He is a ski instructor there and is considered an experienced mountaineer by the Pacific Crest Outward Bound School in Portland.<br>
<br>
Vic Walsh, director of the school, called Summers ``a very<br>
skilled and high-quality instructor.''<br>
<br>
All of the mountaineers questioned say they hope the Oregon<br>
Episcopal School will investigate the accident. If they don't, said<br>
Walsh and Volk, mountaineering groups probably will investigate on their own.<br>
<br>
The small, private school was closed today for the memorial<br>
service, and officials could not be reached for comment.<br>
Walsh said Summers had come to the Outward Bound school to talk<br>
privately with friends there about the accident.<br>
<br>
``We've done some counseling with him in terms of talking to<br>
Ralph last week,'' said Walsh. ``There's no way he's not going to carry the brunt of this, and he knows that. It's a fact of life, and it's a tough one.''<br>

<br>
Marsha King, "A student who turned back reflects on Mount Hood climb," <B>The Seattle Times.</B> May 16, 1986, p. D-1.<br>
<br>
From the moment she set foot on Mount Hood in the early dark<br>
Monday morning, 16-year-old Courtney Boatsman had a weird, nagging<br>
feeling she should get off the mountain.<br>
<br>
 
``It was something that was bugging me all the way up. Kind of<br>
like a voice saying `Go down,' '' she said yesterday in the office at Oregon Episcopal School, which sponsored the fateful climb.<br>
<br>
Eventually, Courtney listened to that voice and became one of<br>
the five young climbers and a parent to turn back before the cloudless sky suddenly turned white with blinding snow and wind.<br>
<br>
That night she would be among the first to notify school authorities that the climbing team still on the mountain must be in trouble. In the end, only four of the climbing mates she tried to help _ two who walked out and two among those found in an ice cave by rescuers _ would survive.<br>
<br>
But for a few hours that sunny Monday morning, the athletic<br>
teen-ager resisted the urge to quit. ``You're just feeling lazy,'' she told herself. It was beautiful climbing weather and she felt warm and strong. Then, halfway up, her back began to hurt, the result of hours of throwing the javelin and discus at school. And her friend, Lorca Fitschen, unexpectedly became sick, hunched over and crying from a previous injury aggravated by the strenuous climb.<br>
<br>
The Rev. Tom Goman, teacher at the school and leader of the<br>
19-person party, asked Courtney to consider quitting to take Lorca back down the mountain. Hilary Spray, also ill, already had descended with her mother and would leave for home.<br>
<br>
``I wasn't sure. I just had this feeling that it was important<br>
that I go down,'' Courtney said yesterday.<br>
<br>
She and Lorca left their schoolmates, who were exuberant, an<br>
optimism fed by feeling prepared and by knowing that the trek had been successful 36 times before.<br>
<br>
``They felt pretty good about it because of the training. They<br>
felt that was all they needed to know,'' the young woman recalled.<br>
The climb by sophomores is part of Basecamp, a four-year,<br>
high-school-level program required for graduation from the small private school. If a student elects, for good reason, not to make the climb, he or she must complete 40 hours of community service. Most choose Mount Hood.<br>
<br>
No one is forced to reach the top. But they must complete the<br>
training courses and then climb far enough to get a taste of the<br>
mountain with a pack on their back.<br>
<br>
Oregon Episcopal School has fostered this wilderness education<br>
because ``it teaches leadership skills, responsibility and preparedness and instills the spirit of adventure,'' said Mariann
<br>
Koop, school spokesperson, last night. ``Students learn safety and gain a real sense of community and shared experience.''<br>
<br>
Training includes several hours of conditioning climbs, and<br>
lessons in how to conserve energy on the mountain and the use of<br>
climbing equipment. Students get hands-on experience with ropes,<br>
carabiners, harnesses and slings, plus instruction on different ways to save oneself using an ice axe.<br>
<br>
Goman, head of the sophomore Basecamp program for the past nine<br>
years, was an expert climber, and insisted everything about an<br>
expedition be ``right to the tiniest detail,'' said Lynn Boatsman,<br>
Courtney's mother. Two weeks ago Goman climbed the mountain, to<br>
determine how and where winter weather might have made the trek too<br>
difficult.<br>
<br>
``He told the kids how their boots should feel when they left<br>
home and how they should feel when they got to the mountain to climb,'' said Lynn Boatsman.<br>
<br>
If the boots slipped on easily at home, they weren't wearing<br>
enough socks, she said. Though this was to be only a day climb, Goman's list of what to take was extensive: ice axes, helmets, slings, carabiners, harnesses, all kinds of clothing and lots of food. Each climber had to wear three pairs of wool socks, layers of clothing and carry an extra pair of gloves.  Students were checked for this equipment before boarding the bus Sunday night, said Boatsman.<br>
<br>
Later, she was told, Goman would give up all his extra clothing to the kids on the climb.<br>
<br>
When Courtney and Lorca left the group Monday morning, Goman<br>
told them they could expect the rest of the climbers back by 6 p.m. A few hours later, the young women were joined by two other climbers: John Whitson, who seemed sick with indigestion, and Michael Garrett from Entiat, Wash., who accompanied him.<br>
<br>
That afternoon the four fooled around at the lodge, occasionally<br>
going outside to view their classmates in steady ascent.<br>
<br>
At 3:30 p.m., clouds suddenly ``started moving in really fast,'' said Courtney, and by 3:45 p.m. the teen-agers at the mountain's base couldn't see anything above.<br>
<br>
At 9 p.m., Courtney and the group's bus driver went to the Mount<br>
Hood day lodge and anxiously began the series of calls that finally<br>
brought help.<br>
<br>
Yesterday, as the tragedy unfolded, anxiety-filled parents and<br>
students milled around the school's administrative building,
occasionally clustering at the TV hoping for a positive recent report.<br>
<br>
Courtney, her close-cropped, curly-haired head held high, calmly<br>
stood in the lobby offering strength and comfort to kids who often<br>
approached her near tears. A tragedy like this, she explained, must be dealt with gently.<br>
<br>
Later that evening _ when those who waited knew the party had<br>
been found but didn't know how many would live _ the school sponsored a counseling session to teach parents to help their children deal with grief.<br>
<br>
This morning, Lynn Boatsman said she still has such faith in the<br>
school and the climb that she would send either of her daughters up<br>
again.<br>
<br>
Courtney calls the accident ``just one of those things that<br>
happens. I would still go up again, I'd still feel safe.''<br>
<br>
Her attitude, too, was positive today. ``That there were<br>
survivors at all was excellent; was really, really good.''<br>

Eric Nalder, Jack Broom and Dave Birkland, "Mount Hood tragedy, three critical, search continues for missing eight as doctors try to revive climbers," <B>The Seattle Times.</B> May 14, 1986 p. A-1.<br>
<br>
Three climbers stranded during a school-sponsored climb on Mount Hood were found this morning, and doctors were attempting to revive them, authorities said. Eight others from the party stranded on the mountain since Monday remained missing.<br>
<br>
The three climbers, one female and two males, were airlifted to<br>
Portland's Emmanuel Hospital, where attempts were begun to revive them, said hospital spokeswoman Paula Anderson.<br>
<br>
Dr. Jonathan Hill told Anderson the three had body temperatures<br>
of about 45 degrees Fahrenheit when they were brought in. They were<br>
being slowly warmed and kept alive on life-support systems.<br>
<br>
The climbers were found at the 8,200-foot level of the 11,239-foot mountain, said Clackamas County Sheriff's Deputy Russ Williams.The climbing group was from Oregon Episcopal School in Portland.<br>
Williams said it was not known if the three hospitalized climbers
<br>
were adults or teen-agers.<br>
<br>
He said it's believed the three had been trying to hike down to<br>
get help.<br>
<br>
More than two dozen relatives of the missing people had gathered<br>
in a day lodge at Timberline by late morning today, waiting for word of those still missing.<br>
<br>
Hospital officials said there is a chance the three climbers<br>
could be revived. The climbers, whose names were not released, were officially listed in critical condition.<br>
<br>
``It is difficult to know their condition. They have to be warmed<br>
up first,'' David Long told United Press International. Long is director of the hospital's Life Flight helicopter service, which brought two of the climbers to the hospital.<br>
<br>
``The doctors have to take it step by step and very slowly and<br>
warm them up and hope that their life lines will follow,'' Long said.<br>
<br>
The search for the missing climbers focused on the southeast<br>
flanks of the mountain where 45 people and two helicopter crews searched through the day, authorities said.<br>
<br>
The remaining members of the climbing party have been stranded<br>
since Monday when hazardous weather enveloped the mountain.<br>
Searchers found no trace of a snow cave where the climbers were<br>
thought to be staying, Williams said.<br>
<br>
Two others in the ``wilderness experience'' group were able to<br>
hike out early yesterday and alert authorities.<br>
<br>
Foul weather and winds gusting to 60 mph made it impossible last<br>
night to locate the stranded group.<br>
<br>
The climbing party that left Portland in the early hours Monday<br>
included 11 sophomores, three adults from the school and four advanced climbing-team members with extensive experience.<br>
<br>
Five people _ three of the students and two of the professional<br>
climbers _ turned back during the day Monday for various reasons, such as altitude sickness and wetness,  according to Mariann Koop, a spokesman for the school.<br>
 
The rest of the group was expected back about 6 p.m. Monday, but<br>
were caught in bad weather that forced them to seek refuse in a snow cave.<br>
<br>
The entire group spent about two hours digging the cave by hand,<br>
according to Molly Schula, 17, one of the two who walked out, according to The Associated Press. She said the cramped cave was cold and wet inside, but provided enough shelter that the climbers were able to sleep off and on.<br>
<br>
Schula said the climbing party decided to dig in when whiteout<br>
conditions got so bad ``there was no distinction between the sky and snow.'' She said the group was within 14 feet of the summit when the storm struck.<br>
<br>
Schula walked off the peak with professional mountaineer Ralph<br>
Summers, 30, yesterday morning. They found help at a ski resort 16 miles from their starting point at Timberline Lodge.<br>
<br>
They had hiked down to get help and pinpoint the location of the<br>
cave, Koop said.<br>
<br>
Summers and Schula left because he was an experienced guide and<br>
she was one of the strongest members of the group.<br>
<br>
``I told them we would keep walking until we found help or until<br>
we died,'' Summers said.<br>
<br>
``I was not prepared for something like this,'' Schula said. ``I<br>
kept thinking I would never get home and see my mother again. All I wanted to do was go home.''<br>
<br>
The climb of Mount Hood was a routine outing for high-school<br>
sophomores in the school's ``wilderness experience program,'' Koop said.<br>
<br>
``This is the 36th year, and we've done the climb every year. It<br>
teaches preparedness, responsibility and leadership,'' she said.<br>
Some classes were cancelled today at the private school in<br>
southwest Portland, which has an enrollment of 576 students in preschool through high-school grades. ``Right now we have people doing everything they can to offer support to our students who have relatives on the trip,'' Koop said.<br>
<br>
The names of the two adults who remained with the group are<br>
Thomas Gorman and Marion Horwell, but their ages were not known,<br>
Clackamas County deputies said.<br>

The names and ages of the teen-agers are: Richard Hader, 15;<br>
Eric Sandvick, 15; Pat McGuinness, 15; Giles Thompson, 15, of Longview, Wa.; Erwin O'Leary, 15; Tasha Amy, 15; Alisa Litzenberger, 15; Briton Clark, 15; and Susan McClave, 17.<br>
<br>
Mount Hood, one of the Pacific Northwest's most climbed<br>
mountains, has been the scene of several spring climbing tragedies.<br>
<br>
The worst accident on the mountain occurred the same day as the<br>
worst climbing accident in the history of Mount Rainier, four years ago.<br>
<br>
Five climbers died on Mount Hood on June 21, 1981, as the result<br>
of a fall during high winds and blowing snow conditions. In all, 10<br>
climbers were involved in the fall. That same day, 11 climbers were<br>
crushed by an icefall on Mount Rainier.<br>
<br>
Two Eugene, Ore., men survived for five days burrowed deep into<br>
the snow during a vicious storm on Mount Hood in January 1971. The men huddled in a snow cave in a single sleeping bag under subzero<br>
temperatures and winds up to 80 miles per hour at the 10,000 foot level of the mountain.<br>
<br>
Two climbers in March 1979 survived two days in a snow cave at<br>
8,000 feet. But in July 1980, doctors worked unsuccessfuly for more than four hours to save the life of a 28-year-old Oregon man who was nearly frozen when an Air Force Reserve helicopter pulled him from the mountain in April 1980.<br>

<br>
The bodies of three climbers stranded on Mount Hood were found<br>
this morning, but there was no sign of eight other people missing since Monday, authorities said.<br>
<br>
The bodies were found at the 7,500-foot level of the mountain,<br>
said Clackamas County Sheriff's Deputy Russ Williams. He said it was not known if they were adults or teen-agers.<br>
<br>
At least two helicopters and an expanded ground team were searching the southeast side of the mountain for the other members of a group of two adults and nine teen-agers who were reported missing when
hazardous weather  enveloped the mountain.<br>
<br>
Searchers found no trace of a snow cave where the climbers were<br>
thought to be staying, Deputy Sheriff Russ Williams of Clackamas County said this morning.<br>
<br>
Whiteout conditions that limited visibility to less than 2 feet<br>
and winds gusting to 60 mph made it impossible to locate the stranded group last night.<br>
<br>
The party of 13 climbers left Timberline Lodge early Monday. A<br>
search began early yesterday when the group failed to return as expected at 6 p.m. Monday.<br>

Mutiny and Murder<br>
<br>
Carol J. Lind, "Mutiny and Murder," <B>Western Gothic.</B> Seattle: C.J. Lind, 1983, p. 30-31.<br>
<br>
In the year of 1841, a Spanish bark put in for water off the Oregon coast of what is now known as Columbia City.  The ship was said to have carried gold, which might account for the unruly behavior of the crew, along with poor diet, too long at sea, and harsh discipline.<br>
<br>
Fresh water was needed, which forced the captain to anchor briefly along the little known coastline.  The mood of the crew was such the ship's officers were forced to watch the mutinous-mnded crew.  Even so, the anchor chain had barely ran out before the sailors fell upon the officers, murdering them.  The crew seized all the valuables they could carry and packed it ashore.<br>
<br>
What happened after that is unclear.  Possibly there was a quarrel over the distribution of the plunder.  When it was over, several of the claimants had been slain.<br>
<br>
In addition, the Indians did not welcome the bad tempered evil-reputation sailors engaged in a bloody fight, thus far, among themselves.  The still remaining crew recognized an increasingly hostile reaction fran the natives, so agreed to bury the loot.<br>
<br>
This was allegedly done on a tract that eventually became known as Hez Copler Is farm.  Hardly had the talk been completed before the Indians,who had been passing through, now set up their lodges in a display that they intended to stay.  The mutineers scurried back to the ship and sailed away.<br>
<br>
Several years of wandering, fighting, and mayhem passed before what remined of the crew returned to claim the gold.  To their relief the Indians had moved their camp years earlier.<br>
<br>
The sailors searched frantically for the gold, but in vain.  Disgusted, they returned to the beached longboat, and gathered together.  They discovered the man who had supervised the burial of the loot in 1841, had now disappeared.  The search for him was as frustrating as the search for the gold.  Eventually, they returned 
to the anchored <B>ship </B>without the gold or the man who had known its location.<br>

Forty years passed.<br>
<B><br>
<br>

The </B>town of Columbia City had sprouted not far from the burial site of the mutineer's gold. There in that coastal town, a group of spiritualists held a meeting.  Amng them a medium announced she had had a vision of the exact location where the mutineers' treasure was concealed.  Anxiously the spiritualists went to the chosen spot.  They searched for several days and found a quantity of broken stones under the soil.  When they lifted out the fragments, one of the party literally dropped dead.<br>
<br>
The medium quickly declared, "The spirit of the departed murdered captain has claimed victim. "<br>
<br>
That amouncement so frightened the Searchers they quickly abandoned the search.<br>
<br>
Not until March 8, 1890 did another party resume the search.The remaining stones were removed.  Human skeletons lay scattered in the opened grave.  But whose? The bones of the mutineers who had been killed or possibly of Indians?<br>
<br>
The discovery was such, one of the party was said to have fallen "into a fit of raving madness." Again the searchers abandoned the site.  From those incidents grew the story of a curse.<br>
<br>
Questions remain: If the only man who knew where the buried gold was hidden had returned with the surviving mutineers and actually stayed away until his companions-in-crime departed, how did he transport the gold out? The gold was heavy, an impossible weight to move in country that lacked roads.  And they had no horses.<br>
<br>
If the story is true, then perhaps the gold is still there.<br>

<br>
Testimony of Earl Ross, First witness in the famous North river "night rider" case referred to in this colum Saturday, opened the way for a flood of evidence of unbelievable conditions in the wilderness north of Willapa harbor.  There was testimony of the hardships of women who followed their men through jungle-like un-
derbrush in the heavily timbered area in the north part of Pacific county.  The lure was the promise of fortune when the logging railroad should reach the timber.<br>
<br>
Women helped bring in the supplies.  They walked 10 to 15 miles to the nearest settlement and back, carrying packs of groceries on their backs, while the men stayed at home doing the work required under the homestead law.  Women also helped with the clearing and were lucky if they did not have small children to care for.<br>
<br>
With the usual hardships incident t & king a timber homestead liveable, there was the menace of the cl jumper who knew enough about law to ra-'e a doubt in the mind of the homesteader.  Sometimes the man who had first claim to the land would be bluffed and alarmed for the safety of his family until he moved out voluntarily.  Others remained to contest for their claims and it was one of those contests which made the basis for the "night rider" case.<br>
<br>
          There were laws, of course, to protect the homesteader, but the "North river country" was far from the seat of even local goverment.  The department of the interior at Washington was 3,000 miles away in distance and much farther in understanding of the homesteaders' problems.  So they made their own laws to fit the occasion and they were for the most part unjust laws and adminis-
tered by might.<br>
<br>
For instance, one of the witnesses for the government testified that when several armed men called at the cabin of Mrs. @largaret Ross and advised her to get out, she asked: "Isn't there any law in the North river?" To which one of the men replied: "Yes there's plenty of law in North river.  This shot gun's a big bunch of law."<br>
<br>
Ot,'-ier t@estimony related to cutting down trees that would fall on<br>
<br>
AFTER MANY YEARS<br>
<br>
the cabin of a settler whose homestead was desired by another.  Bridges were wrecked and trails blocked.  There were mysterious fires and cattle disappeared.  A settler going to the settlement for supplies would find on returning that a fence had been built across his trail and posted with a tresspass sign.<br>

Through the three weeks of the trial testimony favored first one side and then the other.  Each side had its sympathizers.  Attorneys became acrimonious and indulged in personalities and accused each other of unethical methods.<br>
<br>
The defense consisted mostly of character witnesses.  Most of the alleged conspirators had lived in Pacific county more than 20 years.  A Pacific county superior court judge, prosecuting attorney and she'liff testified that they were law abiding and peaceable.  Government attoi.-neys, Clay Allen and George Fishburne t-.he officers of coloring their testimony to favor the defendants but couldn't prove anything.<br>
<br>
Then came the instructions of the court which pointed out some fine distinctions in the federal law.  If the evidence proved that the defendants conspired to defraud Mrs. Ross of her homestead rights a verdict of guilty would be justified.  On the other hand, if it appeared that the attacks on the Ross family were inspired by a desire for revenge for real or fancied wrongful acts on the part of Mrs. Ross and her sons, then the verdict under the federal law would have to be not guilty.<br>
The jurors deliberated about five hours,<br>
<br>
then took the latter horn of the dilemma<br>
and aquitted the defendants.<br>
<br>
That ended the case as far as the conspirac@ charges was concerned but litigation in Some form or ot er has been continued.  Appeals were made to the department of the interior and there was one federal court action in 1919 in which title to one of the North river homesteads ivas attacked.<br>
<br>
AFTER MANY YEARS<br>
<br>
Then Mrs. Ross began a fight in congress for the bill giving her authority to sue the government.  That's the status at present, brought about because a woman wouldn't quit even when she was beaten.<br>
<br>
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br>
<br>
One of the most noted battles in the history of the federal court in Western Washington, the "night rider" case, is recalled by the announcement from Washington, D. C., that Mrs. Margaret M. Ross of Tacoma has been given legal right to sue the United States government for loss of her North River homestead in Pacific county.  The case had dragged through the Pacific county superior court and the federal court for several years when Mrs. Ross lost the action instituted in her behalf by the government.
After the long fight in Pacific county, the case was made a federal court issue through the insistence of Tacoma club women.  Balked in the superior court, Mrs. Ross made an appeal to the club women of the state.  Tacoma women, particularly those connected with the Sunshine society, took an active interest in the case and demanded that Mrs. Ross be given a hearing.<br>
<br>
The federal court case began when 13 Pacific county farmers and homesteaders in Pacific county were indicted by the federal grand jury in May, 1916.  The charge was conspiracy to deprive Mrs. Ross and her two sons and three other homesteaders-Alma DeLong, George Wheaton and Frank Martin-of their homestead rights .<br>
<br>
The thirteen defendants were Ralph and John Howard, Claude Vanderpool, Homer Blaine, Ernest and Walter Burke, Joseph Oxford, Virgil Dolan, Enoch Dillard, Mike Hanrahan, James C. Simmons, Trenton Tidwell and Earl Timmons.  The indictment was returned on evidence that they had threatened the lives of the four homesteaders, had burned the Ross cabin and committed other depredations.<br>
<br>
Clay Allen, now a King County superior judge, and George Fishburne, Tacoma postmaster, were the attorneys for the government.  The defendants were represtented by W.H. Abel, Montesano; T.J. Welsh, South Bend, and the late A.R. Titlow.<br>
<br>
On the jury were Frank McNett, Centralia; C.B. Lyons, Amboy; Thomas Irving, Cathlamet, and George @n er, 1704 So. Yakima ave.; R.C. Hubly, 3019 No. 2.4th Walter S. Sessions, 3410 No. Madison; Fred Pentecost , Regents Park (Firerest); Van E. Williams 3911 No. 34th st.; C.A. Foss, 423 Dock st.; W.C. Babcock, 1915 No. Cedar; John Donahue, 1601 No. Eighth st.<br>
<br>
In examining the jurors, defense attorneys inquired as to the affiliation of members of their families with womens clubs which had taken an interest in the case.  Several heads of families failed to qualify because their wives or daughters were members of such groups.  During the interrogation of one member of the venire, Judge Allen protested what he declared was frivolous questioning by Attorney Titlow.<br>
<br>

"It's ridiculous," said Judge Allen, "to think that an intelligent business man cannot be an impartial juror because his wife belongs to some club."<br>
<br>
"That only goes to show, your honor," replied Titlow, that the attorney for the government doesn't know anything about women."<br>
<br>
Judge Cushman, with judicial discretion, smiled and told Titlow to proceed with the examination of the juror.<br>
<br>
Up to the time trial opened, Dec. 7, 1916, all the sympathy had been with the Ross family and the three other homesteaders, but when the defendants came into court a division of sentiment set in.  Instead of resembling the yellow novel type of "night rider," they looked like ordinary farmers or business men.  Before the trial ended, public opinion was pretty well evenly divided, because some of the government's testimony was so conflicting.<br>
<br>
Most of the women, however, remained with Mrs. Ross, and deeply resented efforts of the defendants' attorneys to break down the testimony of the government witnesses.  Several of them, meeting Attorney Titlow in the corridor at the conclusion of a particularly hectic session, expressed their opinion of an attorney who would try to take advantage of a "helpless woman struggling for her rights." Titlow did not try to argue the matter.<br>
<br>
First of the government witnesses was Earl Ross.  He told of a terrorizing experience one night in July several years before when a group of masked men armed with rifles and shotguns took Mrs. Ross and the two boys from their cabin, escorted them to the home of a settler several miles away and told them to leave the county.<br>
<br>
Their cabin, he said, was burned by the raiders and other property destroyed.  He was unable to identify all of the raiders, but recognized several by their voices.  One, he said, was a Montesano business man, declared they were "going to drive all the troublemakers out of the North river country."<br>
<br>

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br>
THE NIGHT RIDERS.<br>
<br>
Edward W. Allen, "The Night Riders," <B>The Sou'wester.</B> III (Winter, 1968) p. 71-72.<br>
<br>
In 1914 Pacific County became notorious throughout the Pacific Northwest for harboring a gang of night riders.  It was but natural that ifew people knew the whole truth about the matter; that the very normally law abiding farmers involved acted under extreme provocation and though they did take the law into their own hands, showed considerable restraint.<br>
<br>
A big, strong, vigorous woman named Mrs. Ross, mother of two bad boys, was contesting the land claim of a Mrs. Vanderpool to a tract of timberland in the North River area of Pacific County.  I said "bad boys," for only a few months prior to the event in question, Henrv Ward Beecher Hewen, then Prosecuting Attorney of Pacific County, and I, his deputy, had successfully prosecuted the two boys for way-laying and beating up an old man.<br>
<br>
The conviction later was upheld by the State Supreme Court.  To show Hewen's high standing it might be mentioned that a few years later he was elected judge of Pacific and Wahkiakum counties and held the position for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Vanderpool had built herself a small cottage- at the foot of a fairly steep hill where she and her son were living.  One night in January 1914, I believe it was the 11 th, a large tree which had been growing near the edge of the hill crashed down the hill seemingly directed toward the cottage.  It appeared fortunately to bave been slightly diverted as it came down so that, although it did some damage to the side of the cottage, it did not hit it squarely.  If it had done so, it would have demolished the house and probably have killed the occupants.  There was little doubt in the minds of the farmers round about as to who had felled the tree.<br>
<br>
This was the last of a series of incidents which bad aroused the community against the Rosses and this was felt to be just too much.  So a group of the farmers put on hoods, grabbed Mrs. Ross and the two boys, blindfolded them, took them to the boundary line- between Pacific and Grays Harbor Counties where they had hung three nooses over the road.  They took off the blinders, pointed to the nooses and told the Rosses <B>in </B>no uncertain terms that if they ever showed up around there again, the nooses would
be waiting for them.<br>
<br>
As above indicated, Mrs. Ross was a verv vigorous woman.  She came to South Bend and demanded immediate arrests and prosecution of the farmers and roundly berated all the county officials when this was not done without investigation.  She also threatened the newspapers as to what she would do to them if they published anything against her.<br>
<br>
All this was followed up with complaints to the United States Senators from Washington, the Attorney General, the Governor and others, charging the Pacific County officials with neglect of duty.  Of course, they had only one side of the story until later.<br>
<br>
Governor Ernest Lister called a meeting of the Attorney General, Federal Judge Clay Allen and a few oth(!.rs. He decided that the situation demanded that the Attorney General assist the Pacific County Prosecuting Attorney, which practically meant taking charge of the prosecution.  Assistant Attorney General John WiIson was assigned the case.  A more able selection could hardly have been made, as he previously had served as Prosecuting Attorney of Thurston County, had a fine record and later became an excellent judge.<br>
<br>
But when I was advanced to Assistant Attorney General, I warned Wilson that there were two sides, and he would lose, his case.  As he left Olympia, I reminded him of the warning.  "But," he said, "they are guilty and I have the absolute proof." I had great admiration as well as friendship for Wilson, but laughed at him, mockingly sympathetic for the licking I assured him he would get.  He got it.  On the very first ballot, I understand, it stood unanimously for acquittal.<br>
<br>
These poor farmers were subjected to prosecution after prosecution all arising out of the same facts-burglary, arson, coercion, assault.  John T. Welsh of South Bend represented most of the defendants in most of  the hearings and trials.  Every jury found for the defendants.<br>
<br>
When John I. O'Phelan became Prosecuting Attorney, he moved the Court to dismiss the last case pending.  He called the Court's attention to the fact that cases had been brought against these people by three different prosecuting attorneys, had been heard before three different judges, that there had been verdicts of acquittal by four different juries.  The Court agreed with him that that was enough.  These were Just the state cases, but a Federal prosecution bad the same result.
So the Night Riders were finally cleared, but only after terrific harassment.  The costs were enormous.  The prosecution approached being persecution.  Mrs. Ross wholly falled to clear herself or her boys, but she did get revenge.<br>

R. C. BRENNAN AND THE PIRATES.<br>
<br>
R.H. Calkins, "Captain R. C. Brennan's battle with pirates," <B>High Tide.</B> Seattle: Marine Digest, 1952, p. 151-154.<br>
<br>
One of the sensational stories of Seattle's waterfront more than 40 years ago, in which I had a part, coneemed my good friend Capt.  R. C. Brennan, who quelled a daring attempt of two modem-day pirates, armed with a sawed-off shotgun and a pistol, to seize the steamship Buckman and steal a consignment of gold they believed was aboard.<br>
<br>
Enroute from Seattle to San Francisco, the Buckman was steaming in calm weather August 21, 1910, when two young men, French West and George Washington Wise, who boarded the vessel as passengers, killed Capt.  Edwin B. Wood and took charge of the ship off Eureka, Califomia, intending to beach her.<br>
<br>
Captain Brennan, one of the bravest men I ever knew, was mate of the Buckman.<br>
<br>
Three o'clock in the morning, when all of the passengers and some of the officers of the ship were asleep, was the hour chosen by the pirates to loot the vessel.<br>
<br>
Captain Brennan was off watch and in his cabin.  He heard the shooting and rushed to the scene, fighting a revolver duel with West who had killed Captain Wood in the pilothouse.  Wounded in his battle with Captain Brennan, West seized a life preserver, jumped into the sea and was drowned.<br>
<br>
Wise, who attempted to take charge of the engineroom, was over-
powered by the crew and placed in irons.  He was tried in San Fran-
cisco, found insane, and sent to a Federal institution near Wash-
ington, D. C.<br>
<br>
Captain Brennan's heroism won rapid promotion for him and he became master of important units of the fleet of the Pacific Steamship Company, the Admiral Line.  He served as agent at Hong Kong and finally was appointed operating manager.  In 1927, he became superintendent of Ocean Terminals in Portland, and in 1935 went into the stevedoring business in that city.<br>
<br>
The attempt to hold up the Buckman at sea created an intemational sensation and was one of the big stories of Seattle's waterfront.  When the news was received in Seattle, newspaper offices were swamped with telephone calls from friends and relatives of the pas. sengers, who included a number of tourists.<br>

<br>
One eight-column streamer headline said: "Pirates Attempt To Hold Up Seattle Passenger Ship Off The Oregon Coast."<br>
<br>
West and Wise evidently planned to force the purser to open the safe at gun-point, obtain the gold and other money and valuables, and then line up the passengers and rob them.  Part of the plot was to put the Buckman ashore and there make their escape with the loot.<br>
<br>
I made a vacation trip on the Buckman, which later became the Admiral Evans, and seated at the captain's table, received a first-
hand account of the daring operations of modem-day pirates off the coast of Oregon.<br>
<br>
At the outbreak of the First World War, Captain Brennan was given command of the former coastal steamship Yale, once the pride of the passenger trade between San Francisco and Los Amgeles.<br>
<br>
Equipped with deluxe accommodations, the speedy Yale was a popular ship, not only for excursionists, but business people travelling be-
tween the two cities.<br>
<br>
Commandeered by the Navy for transport service, the Yale left the Pacific Coast in March, 1918, for England.  From July of that year, until May 1919, the famous vessel operated between Southampton, England, and Le Havre, Cherbourg and Boulogne, France, carrying troops across the English Channel.<br>
<br>
It was a hazardous service through one of the most dangerous areas of war-zone waters and the speedy vessel ran at night without lights.  She transported American, British, Portugese and Italian troops from England to France and on the return voyage carried wounded soldiers and prisoners.<br>
<br>
In the same service was the Yale's sister ship, the Harvard, com-
manded by Capt.  Martin F. Tarpey, hero of the Valencia wreck, who later was port captain of the Admiral Line in San Francisco.  The two vessels operated at an average speed of from 22 to 23 knots.<br>
<br>
Under command of Captain Brennan, the Yale, during the First World War, carried 255,000 soldiers, wounded men, prisoners and nurses across the English Channel.  The outstanding service of Captain Brennan won for him the Navy Cross and a citation from President Woodrow Wilson.<br>
<br>
The Yale was sold by the Matson Navigation Company to the Navy for use by Siems Drake Puget Sound, naval contracting firm, and was used as a floating hotel by national-defense workers at Kodiak, Alaska, during the Second World War.<br>
<br>
After the war, the Yale was brought to the Puget Sound Naval Station
at Bremerton where she was idle for three or four years.  The Navy turned the vessel over to the Maritime Commission which sold her to the Walter Johnson Company of Stockton, California.  Then Puget Sound Tug & Barge Company tugs towed the famous old vessel to Stockton where she was scrapped.<br>
<br>
The Yale's sister ship, the Harvard, after escaping submarines and other war craft during her colorful English Channel service, went aground in a murky fog May 30, 1931, four miles North of Point Ar-
guello, near Santa Barbara, California, and became a total loss.  It<br>
was near this point that seven Navy destroyers crashed on the rocks in 1923 with a loss of 22 lives.<br>
<br>
Captain Brennan's ancestors were shipowners and ship masters.  Some of them served in the old East India Company, the historic cor-
poration which opened that country to foreign trade and it was natural that he could not resist the call of the sea even as a small boy.  When he was eleven years old, he ran away from home to join the navaltraining ship Mohican.  It was several months before his parents obtained his discharge and took him back to his home in Oakland.<br>
<br>
When he was 14 years old, Brennan shipped in the British square-
rigger Scottish Moor of Dundee, Scotland, while the vessel was in<br>
San Francisco.  During the next three years, he roamed the seas in<br>
sailing vessels.<br>
<br>
In 1898, Brennan joined the Naval Reserve, expecting that itq members would be called to service in the Spanish-American War.  They were not called and later Brennan signed on as a seaman aboard the transport Meade, operating between San Francisco and Manila.  He remained in that vessel seven months and was promoted to quar-
termaster.  Brennan also served in the transports Buford and Thomas, which gave him valuable experience in his climb from the forecastle to the bridge.<br>
<br>
Captain Brennan always was ready to serve his country.  During the Second World War, he became master of a new Liberty ship, built in Portland.  The vessel disappeared in the Atlantic while en. route to Europe in November, 1942.  The Liberty, not named because she was in war service, was believed to have been sunk by a German submarine.  There were no survivors and no trace of the vessel.<br>

PIRACY
James P. Hagarty, "The modern menace of piracy on the high seas," <B>The Marine Digest.</B> LXIV (November 2, 1985) p. 22-25.<br>
<br>
The recent hijacking of the Italian cruise ship ACHILLE LAURO was perhaps the most notorious act of piracy in modern times.  Although the incident was shocking and unique in many ways, as an act of piracy it was neither very shocking nor at all unusual.  Piracy has again become commonplace in many parts of the world, and today's pirates are often as brutal as any of their fabled predecessors.<br>
<br>
<B>A Big Business</B><br>
<br>
Piracy has been big business around the world for the last five to 10 years.  Unlike the terrorists who hijacked the ACHILLE LAURO for political reasons, most pirates are motivated by greed.<br>
<br>
Pirates stand to make fortunes by commandeering large cargo ships and selling their cargos.  Even when the cargos are sold for far less then their market values, profits in the millions of dollars are easily earned.  In many suspected cases of piracy, ships have simply disappeared, the result of a secretive face-lift involving repainting and renaming the ships.  Sometimes they are simply scuttled.<br>
<br>
Most acts of piracy today and in the past few years have occurred on waters off Asia, Africa, the Caribbean, Persian Gulf and South America.  The 1985 Edition of the Lloyd's Nautical Year Book states piracy at sea has reached alarming levels, noting that pirates around the coasts of Thailand have killed 1,376 people, raped 2,283 and abducted 592 since 1980.<br>
<br>
Because United States-flag vessels sometimes trade in the high-risk areas, the growth of piracy has received considerable attention from U.S. officials.  In September 1981, Burton T. Kyle, the director of the Office of Ship Operations of the Maritime Administration in Washington, D.C., sent out an advisory to international fleet managers warning mariners to use caution in the waters adjacent to Singapore, particularly the Strait of Malacca in the vicinity of Phillip Channel, because of recent attacks on vessels by pirates.<br>
<br>
The Office of Ship Operations of the Maritime Administration has confirmed that the advisory issued in September 1981 is still in effect, as piracy remains a most serious problem.  That office says U.S. nag vessels account for very little trading in the affected areas, but that they will keep U.S. vessels advised as long as the danger persists.<br>
<br>

Although piratical acts are comparatively rare in U.S. waters, they do occur.  For example, in June 1979, a Panamanian-registered freighter was seized by pirates and eventually set on fire and abandoned at the mouth of the Mississippi River.  The pirates, who apparently used the freighter to transport marijuana, had disguised themselves as seamen aboard a shrimp boat in distress.<br>
<br>
The master of the freighter had invited them on board his ship after responding to their distress signal, only to have them seize control of his ship and set him and his crew adrift.<br>
<br>
Recently, the master of a U.S. flag vessel and his crew had to beat off pirates with bats and small arms, but these defenses are rarely successful against today's pirates, who sometimes brandish long knives and cutlasses, but more often wield revolvers, submachine guns, grenade launchers, and other deadly weapons.<br>
<br>
<B>Legal Issues</B><br>
<br>
In spite of the alarming rise of acts of piratical aggression, legal concepts have fallen behind.  Pirates have been declared enemies of all civilized nations, and indeed of the human race, and piracy is viewed everywhere as an offense against the law of nations and against the security of commerce on the high seas.<br>
<br>
The United Nations' Convention on the Law of the Sea (December 1982) declares that "all states shall cooperate to the fullest possible extent in the repression of piracy on the high seas or in any other place outside the jurisdiction of any state."<br>
<br>
Notwithstanding the universal declarations against piracy, there is no generally accepted legal definition of piracy, thus giving rise to a potential conflict between the definitions under international law and the law of each individual country.  Under international law, -piracy is defined as sailing the seas for private ends without authorization from the government of any state, with the object of committing depredations upon property or acts of violence against persons.<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, it is generally accepted that any country may define piracy as it sees fit, to respond to crimes affecting or involving its own citizens, vessels, and territorial waters.<br>
<br>
In the United States, piracy has been defined variously as robbery on the high seas or forcible depredation upon property without lawful authority done with intention to steal.  However, there are many statutes on our books defining specific acts of piracy in very diverse ways.<br>
<br>
Aside from the problem of inconsistent definitions, problems often
arise over the exercise of legal jurisdiction in cases in which pirates have been arrested.  Under international law, pirates committing crimes on the high seas may be subjected to adjudication and punishment by any nation, notwithstanding that the acts may have had no direct effect on that nation.  Additionally, the sovereign nation within whose territory piratical acts were committed clearly has jurisdiction to punish the criminals.  It is also logical that the country of the vessel's flag has jurisdiction in these cases, as is true for the country against whose citizens piratical acts were committed.<br>
<br>
Of course, the ACHILLE LAURO incident has generated much discussion on this question, as both Italy and the United States have sought to try the terrorists for their crimes.  As a practical matter, jurisdiction seems to lie with the country which has physical control over the pirates or their vessels.<br>
<br>
To state that the law does not provide an entirely clear and co-
herent response to the challenge of piracy is not to suggest that the law is the main culprit.  On the contrary, in most nations it is probable that the laws provide an adequate framework for dealing with the problem.  Unfortunately, it is apparent that many of the parties who would seem to be most affected by piracy, including the big shipping companies, the major insurance underwriters, and the banks, have done very little to stop its spread.<br>
<br>
In connection with many acts of modern piracy, banks have released money to people holding fraudulent  documents of title to nonexistent cargo.  It has been suggested by some that banks have been very lax in their examination of shipping documents.  Indeed, fraud has become one of the most common kinds of modern piracy, the victims of which are usually developing countries that do not have the means or experience to combat sophisticated international fraud.<br>
<br>
Additionally, because most Third World nations require that their traders buy shipping insurance locally, the losses remain within their countries.  As a result, the giant insurance companies in such financial centers as London have suffered fewer losses, although they have not escaped entirely the effects of piracy.<br>
<br>
For piracy to be controlled in the 1980's, it is essential that all of the nations of the world, and the key actors in the maritime industry, present a united and aggressive front against piracy in all its forms.<br>

PIRACY<br>
<br>
Gordon R. Newell, "Scuttled by Puget Sound Pirates," <B>SOS North Pacific.</B> Portland: Binfords and Mort, 1955, p. 21-25.<br>
<br>
For more than half a century after the Boston was captured and driven ashore by the piratical Indians of Nootka Sound, red skinned buccaneers were among the navigational hazards of Pacific Northwest waters.  The first steamer on the Pacific, the Hudson's Bay Company's Beaver, was equipped with a battery of brass cannon, small arms, and boarding nets to repel Indian attacks.  Even after the Puget Sound country became fairly civilized, with newspapers, a university, and regular steamboat service, Indian pirates remained a real menace.<br>
<br>
During the Indian War of 1855-1857, any unprotected vessel was fair game for marauding savages.  This continued to be a seasonal occupation with them for many years after the close of hostilities.  The squat and lazy canoe Indians of Puget Sound were seldom if ever the culprits.  They might steal a ship's best bower anchor-if they  got a chance-and trade it to some noble white man for rotgut whiskey, but they were neither violent nor warlike.<br>
<br>
They were not the type to take the anchor by force and arms.<br>
A different breed were the fierce, proud Haidas of the Queen Charlotte Islands to the north.  For generations they had been accustomed to sweep down in their great seagoing war canoes to raid the defenseless natives of Puget Sound.<br>
<br>
These pillaging expeditions provided sport and a certain amount of killing practice for the Haida warriors, besides paying dividends in loot, slaves, and the more desirable women.  The Haidas saw no good reason to discontinue their amiable jaunts after the white men came to the Pacific Northwest.  If the opportunity occurred, they were entirely'willing to kill and rob the newcomers.<br>
<br>
The   Puget   Sound   Herald   at   Steilacoom   warned   its<br>
readers in the Spring of 1858 that "...the northern Indians....<br>
those troublesome and unwelcome neighbors" were on the prowl again, adding that a party of Haidas had made an attempt to take the U. S. Surveying Steamer Fauntleroy in Birch Bay.  The news item concluded with this bit of sage advice: "It becomes the inhabitants to be on their guard."<br>
<br>
The wisdom of the Herald's counsel was borne out by further flagrant and unlawful deeds on the part of the Haidas, whose contempt for the whites extended even to United States Government ships and Federal reservations.<br>
<br>
Late in the summer of 1858, a band of the northern raiders landed at
the New Dungeness Lighthouse, broke open the storehouse, and got away with all the oil for the lamps, the whitehall boat, and a quantity of sails and other supplies.  As keeper Captain Bayling had only one assistant at the station, he wisely barricaded himself in the lighthouse and let the savages depart in peace.  He let it be known, though, that if they had dared to attack the lighthouse he would have chastised them severely.<br>
<br>
The brig Swiss Boy, outbound from Port Orchard to San Francisco, sprang a leak off Cape Flattery and. put into Nitinat Lake on the west coast of Vancouver Island.  The plan was to beach it for repairs, but the crew found the bay occupied by a large band of Haidas.  Like a plague of locusts, several hundred of them swarmed over the little brig, stripping her of all that was movable, in cluding every shred of rigging, the mainmast, the cargo, and the sailors' clothes.<br>
<br>
The unhappy crew were imprisoned, but managed to escape after a few days.  Reaching Victoria, they notified Canadian officials, who dispatched H. M. S. Satellite to round up the Indian pirates that had robbed the honest Yankee mariners of their ship and pants.  Most of the loot was recovered and the chief of the band with several of his lieutenants was taken to Victoria in chains.<br>
<br>
There, to their amazement, they were thrown into jail.  The Canadian Indians had felt that the George's Men as they called the British would be pleased to have them do away with a "Boston Ship."<br>
<br>
Such events convinced the Pacific Northwest skippers of 1858 and 1859 that a canoe full of northern Indians was as potentially dangerous as a lee shore.  Within a few weeks the schooner Blue Wing had the misfortune to fall afoul of both perils.  In her case the Indians proved the more disastrous.  Late in December of 1858, a heavy gale tossed the litle Blue Wing, inbound from Semiahmoo (to-
day's Blaine) to Steilacoom, ashore on Point Wilson.  She was badly damaged but was repaired and refloated.<br>
<br>
In January, 1859, she left Steilacoom on another voyage north in company with the Ellen Marie, also a little fore-and-after.  The two small ships never reached port.  After several months had passed <B>it </B>was assumed that they had sunk or been blown ashore on some remote Vancouver Island beach.  But in April of that year a Puget Sound Indian showed up at Steilacoom with the true story of the schooner's fate.  He said that a small vessel had been destroyed at Vashon Island and her crew murdered.<br>
<br>
An investigation of his story brought out the particulars of the bloody affair.  As the Blue Wing was drifting slowly past the wooded shore of the island, a big canoe came slashing out from a cove,
driving fast for the little ship.  Ten braves and five squaws swarmed over the schooner's low rail to make short work of the surprised, unarmed crew.<br>
<br>
There were no more than four or five men on the schooner and none of them lasted more than four or five seconds after the Haidas hit the deck.  Then the Indians quickly tossed bundles of loot from the ship's blood-stained boards into the big canoe, opened the seacock and departed.<br>
<br>
Five minutes later the war canoe and the killers were out of sight in the dark shadows of the island's tidal forest. The Blue Wing with her dead crew, slowly settled to the bottom of the Sound.<br>
<br>
Later the Haidas fell on the Ellen Marie, but her skipper, Captain McHenrie, was armed and the crew more alert.  The Captain fired on the canoe when the Indians tried to board, killing the pirate leader, Haida Jim.  Though the war canoe swiftly withdrew out of range, the Captain's victory was short-lived.<br>
<br>
At midnight the Indians paddled stealthily into the cove where the schooner had anchored for the night.  The Captain and most of the crew were asleep and the Haidas drifted over the rail as silently as swooping gulls.  A strangled cry or two, the flash of knives in the starlight, and it was all over.  Another load of booty was tossed into the canoe, a jug of oil was broken on the cockpit deck, and a torch was flung.<br>
<br>
The Ellen Marie and her crew were disposed of as neatly and even more completely than the Blue Wing and her cargo of dead men.  No Barbary pirates ever did their work more efficiently than the Indian freebooters of the Northwest Coast.<br>
<br>
The arrival of steam revenue cutters and warships after the Civil War finally put an end to these pirate raids, but not until the majesty of the Federal Government had received a final insult from the savages.<br>
<br>
One day the whole crew of the Tatoosh Island Light Station came ashore, announcing that they had resigned.  Inquiries brought out their reason.  The Indians had taken over the island, declaring with simple dignity that it had always belonged to them and, since the Great White Father had never paid them for it, they considered it still their property.<br>
<br>
They would make a potlatch house of the hyas long house with the great fire on the roof.  The white men had better vacate.  The white men did, and until the government got the ownership question straightened out -with the aid of a gunboat-Tatoosh Light had the distinction of being the only station of the U. S. Lighthouse Service to be owned and operated by Indian pirates.<br>

PIRACY.<br>
<br>
Barry M. Gough, "Indian piracy in the Queen Charlottes," <B>Gunboat Frontier. British Maritime Authority and Northwest Coast Indians, 1846-1890.</B> Vancouver: University of British Columbia Press, 1984, p. 79-81.<br>
<br>
As in the Queen Charlottes along the west coast of Vancouver Alsland the British faced difficulties in protecting settlers and traders and property  and in maintaining order among fiercely independent Indian tribes. In the deep arms of the Pacific Ocean that penetrate far into the Island and in the interlocking channels and numerous coves that were the natural habitat of these vigorous seafaring peoples, the west coast Indians possessed a maritime environment that provided wealth, prestige, and security.  North and west from Fort Victoria, the shore is virtually unbroken except for Port San Juan opposite Cape Flattery at the entrance to Juan de Fuca Strait.<br>
<br>
But at Cape Beale, Barkley Sound and its annex Alberni Canal affords a vast, navigable highway into the Island's heartland.  From Amphitrite Point to Lennard Island the shore is again relatively unbroken, but at Lennard Island Clayoquot Sound begins-a maze of channels and islands not as spacious as Barkley Sound but still a domain unto itself.<br>
<br>
Farther northwest again, beyond Hesquiat Harbour and Estevan Point, lies legendary Nootka Sound, another extensive marine access into the Island's interior.  Northwest once more the mariner finds in turn Esperanza Inlet, Kyuquot Sound, Quatsino Sound, and the Island's northwesternmost tip, Cape Scott, which points to the broad reaches of the North Pacific stretching across to Asia.<br>
<br>
Barkley and Clayoquot, Nootka and Quatsino-these were the seats of empire of peoples who differed as much from each other as Latvians do from Russians or French from English -with different languages and modes of behaviour that they prized and defended.<br>
<br>
From the  time  of  earliest  European  contact,  especially  after  James Cook's 1778 visit, whites had shown a preference for the Nootka, who were skilled diplomats and traders.  The Kyuquot to the north were more difficult to deal with, as they were reluctant to welcome foreigners.  So were the Clayoquot, including the Ahousat tribe to the south, who acquired a reputation as aggressive and dangerous.<br>

They were regarded as such by their native enemies, the name Clayoquot having been given them by their neighbours.  The term meant that they were different from what they had been; and the Indian oral tradition held that the Clayoquot had once been quiet and peaceful but that later they had grown troublesome and treacherous.' Even their appearance frightened some intruders: one trader thought some of these tribes "really looked as if they had escaped from the dominions of Satan himself."<br>
<br>
From the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, this maritime frontier had a violent history of white-native contact. Such events as the captivity of the English carpenter John Jewitt in 1803 and the loss of John Jacob Astor's Tonquin in <B>1811 </B>among the natives were celebrated stories at Victoria.<br>
<br>
In these inshore waters, piracy had been frequent.  Captains and crews of trading vessels on the coast sought to avoid the tribal rivalries and relentless warfare that existed among the west coast Indians, particularly the Clayoquot and Ahousat peoples, that continued through the 1850's- "They are a most treacherous, thievish lot of rascals that cannot be trusted out of sight."<br>
<br>
The master of H.M.S. Hecate there on survey in <B>1861 </B>wrote of the Ohiet Indians living near Port Effingham on the outer reaches of Barkley Sound, "altho' civil enough for us being man of war's men; but poor lost away ships crews have been dreadfully maltreated by them."<br>
<br>
He held similar views of the neighbouring Sechart and Uclulet, remarking of the latter that "they would be only too glad to murder all the boats crew for sake of the utensils in her; only knowing us to be a man of war- of which they have a wholesale dread, are afraid of the consequences."<br>
<br>
Moreover, these Indians' concept of property contrasted sharply with that of the whites.  The American trader John Boit claimed that these Indians would pilfer whenever they had the chance.' They did not acknowledge rights of salvage of wrecked vessels;- Vice Admiralty courts were unknown to them.<br>
<br>
Any whiskey trader or sealer sailed this coast at his own risk, aware of the consequences if his vessel ran aground on a hidden rock or was dashed to ruin in a gale.<br>
<br>
Captain Vancouver's surveys, though important, had actually given navigators only a modicum of data on the Island's waters.  The jagged shoreline remained largely unsurveyed until Captain [George Henry] Richards examined Barkley Sound in 1859 (the Admiralty published his chart of the area in <B>1861) </B>and completed the rough features of a cartographic outline as far north as Cape Scott in 1862.<br>
<br>
Thus in the late 1850's these largely uncharted, unlighted, and
unbuoyed waters were a veritable graveyard of ships ready to entice to destruction the ignorant or distressed mariner.<br>

<br>
In 1977 the OMER added a strange incident to her history and to the annals of the Foss Company.  It wasn't a calamity, but <B>it </B>was mysterious and could have been tragic.  On a Sunday In November the OMER was stolen from her berth at the Foss float!<br>
<br>
Ocean freighters, while waiting for a berth, usually anchor in Tacoma Harbor and Foss tugs often provide shipto-shore launch service for the crew.  During this particular Sunday afternoon, the DONNA and OMER were providing transportation from and to a Greek freighter.<br>
<br>
Several of the ship's crew had been taken ashore during the day and by late evening all but four had returned to the ship.  About midnight, the remaining four men staggered up to the Foss float, in need of transportation for one thing.  The Mate on the DONNA FOSS informed them that the DONNA had to leave for Seattle immediately, but the CATHERINE would be available within an hour to run them out to their ship. (The OMER was also at the float, but without a crew.)<br>
<br>
The first report that all was not well came from a call to the night dispatcher in Seattle from the CATHERINE FOSS at about 0100, stating that a tug looking like the OMER was running, without lights, on an erratic course toward the anchored Greek ship.<br>
<br>
The CATHERINE was tied up on another job and could not break free to check on the situation.  The question was whether <B>it </B>was a regular pleasure boat or the OMER-turned into a pleasure boat.<br>
<br>
The only vessel in Tacoma available to check on the OMER's whereabouts was the Crowley tug, BARBARA S. She made a quick run up the waterway to the Foss float and verified that indeed the OMER had disappeared.  The BARBARA S. began a search in Tacoma Harbor for the missing tug.  There was no sign of the OMER.  Eventually, a report from an outbound freighter leaving Tacoma Harbor complained of narrowly missing a small tug running without
lights at the outer boundary of the harbor.<br>
<br>
The BARBARA S. headed out and found the OMER with no one aboard running at slow speed and turning on circles The Barbara's crew stopped the Omer, put the rudder admiships and towed her to the Foss dock<br>
<br>
Upon inspection she was found to be no worse for the escapade.  There was a whole case of empty beer bottles scattered around the wheelhouse so the OMER no doubt did some strange maneuvering.  But sending the boat out to run around the area with no on aboard and without lights was the height of recklessness-a serious collision and possible loss of life could easily have occurred.  Fortunately, the harbor traffic at the time was light.<br>
<br>
After a general cleanup on  Monday,  the  OMER  was  ready  to  assume  her  normal  duties,  with  an  American  crew. Foss made a claim against the ship's local agents for the expense involved and in time the claim was paid, but the identity of the four sea-going hijackers was never divulged.<br>

PIRATES OF THE BUCKMAN.<br>
<br>
Gordon Newell, "Maritime Events of 1910," H.W. McCurdy Marine History of the Pacific Northwest. Seattle: Superior Publishing Company, 1966. p. 178.<br>
<br>
A remarkable case of murder and piracy on the high seas occurred in late August of 1910 aboard the steamship Buckman of the Alaska Pacific Steamship Co. The pirates of the Buckman came aboard innocently enough as passengers at Seattle.<br>
<br>
One of them, French West, had served as quartermaster in the Navy and was a graduate of Capt.  Marshall's navigation school on Colman Dock, Seattle, having made several voyages as mate of the coastwise barkentine Echo.  His partner was a saloon hanger -on named George Washington Wise.<br>
<br>
At about 2:00 a.m. on August 21 the steamship was off Eureka, with West and Wise prowling the deserted decks, one carrying a shotgun, the other a Navy revolver.  After a whispered consultation amidships, West, carrying the shotgun, headed for the cabin of the vessel's master, Capt.  E. B. Wood.<br>
<br>
Wise moved stealthily toward the engine room; their plan was
simple.  West was to take over the bridge, Wise the engine room, forcing the ship's officers at gun point to beach the liner on the California coast, after which the two desperados would loot the purser's safe, rob the passengers, and escape ashore.<br>
<br>
Capt.  Wood, at the age of 37, was a veteran of 24 years at sea.  At the turn of the century he had been second mate of the Roanoke in the Nome trade.  James McIntyre had been first officer and Capt.  Harry Weaver master.  Capt.  Weaver was stricken with pneumonia at sea and died  shortly after making port at Seattle.  McIntyre was killed in the sinking of the Bristol, and Capt.  Wood had been known to make joking remarks referring to the old superstition that deaths usually come in three's, he being the only survivor among the Roanoke's ranking deck officers.<br>
<br>
When he was confronted by the armed West, Capt.  Wood reached for his revolver, and was instantly killed by the blast of the would -be robber's shotgun.  As the slayer dashed toward the bridge he was intercepted and overpowered by Chief Officer R. C. Brennan and a quartermaster, but wrestling himself free, the slayer leaped over the rail and into the sea.<br>
<br>
The Buckman was then 20 miles offshore, and West's body was never recovered, although the steamship President, informed of the tragedy by wireless, made a thorough search of the adjacent waters shortly thereafter.<br>
<br>
The surviving pirate, Wise, was overpowered by the engine room crew and placed in irons.  He went violently insane during his subsequent trial at Seattle, ending his days in the criminal ward of a state asylum.<br>

POACHING.<br>
<br>
John Harrison, "Poaching cuts run sizes  on rivers and high seas," <B>Northwest Energy News.</B> January-February, 1992. p. 33-39.<br>
<br>
On the lower Snake River between little Goose and Lower Monumental dams, there is a marina that displays a photograph of a fisherman holding a 20-pound chinook salmon.<br>
<br>
It's a recent photo, but that part of the Snake River has been closed to salmon fishing for years.  The chinook may have been taken illegally.  Washington state fisheries agents hope to find the fisherman and question him.<br>
<br>
A thousand miles to the west, on the gray, rolling seas of the North Pacific <B>Ocean</B>, Asian drift-net fishers reel out 30-mile long nets.  Their quarry: squid.  Their catch: squid, sea mammals, birds and Columbia River Basin salmon.<br>
<br>
Statistics compiled by the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans suggest the illegal take of all Pacific Coast salmon by drift-net fishers was 6,000 metric tons in 1990, and that is only for fish that were canned.  The estimate does not include the number that were frozen and smuggled whole to Asian nations, where raw salmon is a delicacy.<br>
<br>
If the Snake River fisherman caught his salmon illegally, he'll have something in common with ocean drift-net fishers: piracy.<br>
<br>
From the high seas to the Columbia River Basin, illegal fishing is exacting a toll on salmon that can't be measured in dollars alone.  In the case of Snake River sockeye salmon, illegal fishing may be contributing to the extinction of the species.  In November, the National Marine Fisheries Service listed Snake River sockeye as an endangered species.  Only four adults-three males and a female-returned to spawn last year at Redfish Lake in central Idaho.<br>
<br>
Efforts to stop illegal fishing are as wide-ranging as the fish themselves, from surprise sweeps of fishermen on the Columbia and Snake rivers to sweeping resolutions adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations.<br>
<br>
Last September, the Bonneville Power Administration announced plans to spend  $9.7 million through 1995 to increase enforcement of salmon and steelhead regulations in the Columbia and Snake systems.  The same month, the Northwest Power Planning Council, which authorized the Bonneville-financed crackdown on illegal fishing, approved a resolution supporting the United Nations'
effort to end drift-net fishing in the Pacific Ocean.<br>
<br>
The Council's resolution said the destructive practice must stop, and the United States should pursue sanctions against nations that continue to fish with ocean drift nets.  The Council expressed similar sentiment in a letter to Congress two years ago.<br>
<br>
There have been results<br>
<br>
In late November, after three years of United Nations pressure to end drift-net fishing, Japan's Cabinet approved a compromise that bans the practice by December 31, 1992.  It was a remarkable decision.  Japan has the world's largest drift-net fishing fleet, and the country had been lobbying hard to convince the United Na-
tions to bypass a drift-net moratorium scheduled to go into effect on June 30, 1992.<br>
<br>
Under terms of the compromise, Japan will cut its drift-net fleet by one-half by June 30, 199Z and then cosponsor a United Nations' resolution with the United States that will phase out drift nets, with no exceptions, by December 31, 1992.<br>
<br>
Ted Hallock, chairman of the Power Planning Council, said he welcomed Japan's decision. Right now we are amending our Columbia River Basin fish and wildlife program to improve salmon survival and increase the runs, and we can't expect success if Asian nations are allowed to continue this indiscriminate slaughter of salmon on the high seas," Hallock said.<br>
<br>
After learning of Japan's decision, Curtis Bohlen, U.S. assistant secretary of state, told the Oregonian newspaper of Portland, Oregon: "We think it's the best possible thing that could have happened for the ocean environment of the North Pacific.  It re-
flects a growing recognition by the Japanese of the importance of the marine ecosystem."<br>
<br>
The newspaper also quoted an unnamed official of the Japan Fisheries Agency who said: "It's too bad we have to stop.  Unfortunately, world opinion has not been so sympathetic to our position as we had expected."<br>
<br>
International treaties are in place to protect salmon in the Gulf of Alaska, but pirate driftnet boats sneak north from their customary fishing areas.  The pirates, some of whom conceal the identifying numbers and flags on their vessels, and the legitimate<br>
drift-net fishing fleet wreak an incredible toll on marine life.  Collectively, they are suspected of drowning IM,000 dolphins, 
whales and seabirds each year <B>in</B> the relentless hunt for squid.
<br>
Washington Congresswoman Jolene Unsoeld, Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon and other lawmakers campaigned against the drift-net fishery and helped push for the United Nations' ban.<br>
In a recent news article, Unsoeld said: "This pirate fishery is just too easy and too profitable.  And the international agreements on drift nets have too many loopholes."<br>
<br>
Problems on the river<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, surprise sweeps of fishers in the Columbia Basin began in October.  Fisheries agents and law enforcement officers from Washington, Idaho, Oregon and Columbia River Indian tribes used aircraft, boats and land vehicles to make unannounced inspections of fishing parties.<br>
<br>
During a three-day sweep, the agents contacted 250 fishers and issued 12 citations for various violations.  No illegal fish were discovered, but state and tribal officials estimate that 50,000 to 250,000 of the adult salmon migrating up the Columbia are caught illegally each year.<br>
<br>
That is between 2 percent and 10 percent of all the salmon and steelhead in the Columbia and Snake system.<br>
<br>
"There are enforcement needs from one end of the river to the other," said Lieutenant Andy Meriweather, lower Columbia en-
forcement chief for the Washington Department of Fisheries.  "Primarily, poaching has a commercial aspect, but it can be done<br>
by either sport or commercial fishermen."<br>
<br>
Meriweather said fall probably is the heaviest poaching season because there are plenty of salmon in the rivers, and the eggs of adult females can be sold for a good price.  Poachers often leave behind the flesh of adult spawners, he said.  In the spring, it's just the opposite.  The firmer flesh of spring adults means a good market for whole fish.<br>
<br>
"In the past, we've had big operations in which we have recovered tons of fish," Meriweather recalled.  "In fact, whenever we have initiated an operation, we've always been able to buy out-ofseason fish."<br>
<br>
Illegal fishing is a misdemeanor, but it can be a felony if the value of the stolen fish exceeds $250.  Law enforcement officers typically seize a fisherman's gear as well as the fish, and conviction can bring a fine and jail time.<br>
<br>
But the Columbia is a big river. Even with the additional en
-
forcement being financed with the Bonneville money, illegal fishing is difficult to discover.  Meriweather's approach is to "...create an expectation of being caught."<br>
<br>
Bob Schafer, who works for the Washington Department of Wildlife in Yakima, agreed that it is important to create that expectation and to educate law-abiding fishers that they should release the big fish they catch out of season.  Schafer took part in the re-
cent surprise inspections on the Snake River.<br>
<br>
"They might be so excited because they've just caught the biggest fish of their lives, and now they're going to go home and have a party.  But they need to understand that by keeping that fish they are damaging the resource," Schafer explained.<br>
<br>
He said poaching "isn't the biggest problem we have on the river, but it's significant." Poaching also isn't a localized problem, he added.  It takes place up and down the river.<br>
<br>
"It's a lot of little operations, and that's just the problem," he said.  "Cumulatively, it adds up to a hell of a lot of fish."<br>
<br>
"A publicity stunt"<br>
<br>
To many commercial fishermen, the recent crackdown on illegal fishing is nothing more than a big budget for a small problem.<br>
"We view it as a publicity stunt by Bonneville," said Frances Clark of Chinook, Washington.  She and her husband, Les, are longtime gill-net fishers.  "There just isn't that much going on, at least with gill-netters."<br>
<br>
She said State and sport fishers, who often crowd tributaries in search of salmon and steelhead, take more fish illegally than commercial fishers.<br>
<br>
Steve King, program leader for Columbia River management at the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, said poaching was a greater problem in the 1970s than it is today.<br>
<br>
"In the 1980s, there was some big enforcement," he said, recalling the 1982 "Salmonscam." In that sting operation, fisheries agents infiltrated a fish poaching ring in the Columbia River Gorge and arrested a number of people for catching and selling tons of fish illegally.<br>
<br>
Now enforcement increased, including stronger enforcement of Indian fishing by the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission.  In addition, the growing public recognition of the critical problems with some runs has increased peer pressure to halt illegal fishing and changed public attitudes, he reasoned.
Mark Doumit, a gill-net fisherman and Wahkiakum County, Washington, commissioner, said more enforcement is needed, es-
pecially of recreational fishers.<br>
<br>
"There needs to be more enforcement of the Buoy 10 fishery [in the lower Columbia River], particularly," he said.  "Some of those people go back several times a day.  There's a lack of ac-
countability on punch cards." Doumit recalled that the Washington Department of Fisheries once had an enforcement officer stationed at Cathlamet, the county seat, but no longer does.<br>
<br>
Fred Johnson, the Wahkiakum County prosecutor, said he has seen stiff penalties imposed for fishing-a year in jail in one recent case-but that prosecutions are too few and far between.<br>
"Once, a district court judge saw a set net in the river and re-
ported it to the fisheries department, but it took three days to get an officer here.<br>
<br>
By then, it was gone," he said.  "I know a lot of sport fishermen are fishing year round and selling the fish illegally. I have heard anecdotal stories about people coming up here from Arizona in motor homes to catch and can salmon.  They come up here with orders."<br>
<br>
What's needed, he said, is a commitment from the state to step up enforcement.<br>
<br>
Chasing pirates<br>
<br>
More enforcement appears likely as a result of the Bonneville financing, but the problem won't be approached as easily on the high seas.  That is because policing the drift-net fishery in the vast expanse of international waters is much more difficult than policing fishing in the Columbia River Basin.<br>
<br>
Japan, South Korea and Taiwan all appear willing to go along with a ban.  But Hong An, a lobbyist for the Korean Deepsea Fisheries Association, told the States News Service in June 1990 that Korean fishermen resent international agreements that force them to buy locating devices for their boats and allow foreign observers on board.<br>
<br>
"This is still the high seas," he said.  "Most fishermen consider it a freedom, a right, to harvest anywhere in the sea."<br>
ong An and other spokesHmen for the Asian drift-net fleet either deny their vessels catch salmon or say the salmon catch is very small as a percentage of the squid catch.  However, in 1989, a sting operation caught a single Taiwanese merchant with 3.3 million pounds of illegal salmon.<br>

<br>
In 1990, observers from the United States and Canada were allowed on board 45 Japanese drift-net vessels - 10 percent of the fleet.  During the squid fishing season, the nets from those boats killed thousands of sea birds, mammals and fish, including 9,747 salmon and steelhead.  About one-third of the salmon and steelhead were identified by species, and of these, a fraction bore tags marking them as Snake River steelhead.<br>
<br>
If 10 percent of the Japanese fleet killed nearly 10,000 salmon, then the number killed by the entire legal drift-net fishery prob-
ably is in the hundreds of thousands.<br>
<br>
Then there is the problem of pirate drift-net vessels-the iHeFal fishery-which ignore all fishing regulations.  The number of sea creatures-salmon included killed by pirate vessels can only be estimated.<br>
<br>
In 1990, 10 pirate drift-net vessels flying North Korean flags were caught in Soviet waters fishing for salmon.  Most of the crew members were Japanese.  They were arrested and taken to the Soviet Union to stand trial.<br>
<br>
Patrolling the legal drift-net fleet and the shadowy pirates across the vast Pacific is a difficult task, to say the least.  Political pressure directed at driftnetting nations may prove to be more effective at controlling the slaughter.  To that end, Congresswoman Unsoeld said she was pleased by Japan's decision to phase out drift-net fishing by the end of 1992.<br>
<br>
A week before the decision was announced, she made a lobbying trip to the United Nations with Charles Gauvin, executive director of Trout Unlimited, and Billy Frank, chairman of the Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission.<br>
<br>
In a statement released at the time, the three wrote, "The world's marine resources simply cannot withstand the onslaught of a technology that-counting Japan's 1990 take-killed more than 41 million marine animals as 'bycatch,' to say nothing of the tens of thousands of U.S. salmon and steelhead stolen each year."<br>
Unsoeld called the Japanese decision "a very gratifying step," but she noted much work remains to be done.  For example, the U.N. General Assembly has not approved the compromise, and the problem of pirate vessels remains.<br>
<br>
"Even our own State Department acknowledges that these vessels will be on the high seas after the new U.N. resolution is in place," she said.<br>
<br>
Unsoeld said the U.S. Coast Guard needs help in patrolling the
ocean for pirates.  Currently, the Coast Guard has only one cutter to patrol the entire North Pacific.<br>
<br>
However, she added, "I am very pleased with this progress to ban the use of these curtains of death.  It is gratifying to see our State Department and the world community understand that our worldwide marine resources, abundant as they may be, cannot withstand the onslaught of these 30-mile-long nets." -@@o<br>

ROY GARDNER.<br>
<br>
Hollis B. Fultz, "Roy Gardner, professor of escape," <B>Famous Northwest Manhunts and Murder Mysteries.</B> Elma, Washington: Fulco Publications, 1955 p. 217-229.<br>
<br>
On the afternoon of April 16,1920, the driver of a mail truck in the city of San Diego, Calffornia, found himself suddenly gazing into the muzzle of an automatic pistol, held in the hands of a smiling, curly-headed young man, who somehow seemed familiar through his mask.  In a few minutes seventy-eight thousand dollars in cash and negotiable securities had been transferred to an old car standing nearby, and the robber sped away.<br>
<br>
It was a smooth job, with little commotion.  And yet, within three days the bandit was under arrest and nearly a]Ll the loot had been recovered.  The robber had been recognized by the truck driver as a railroader with whom he had once worked.<br>
<br>
The name of Roy Gardner, was rather a new one to the police, but before many months had passed it was almost as familiar as that of Harry Tracy or Jesse James.<br>
<br>
Nevertheless it was the young man's second offense, and the judge gave him no mercy.  He was sentenced to twentyfive years in McNeil's Island Federal Penitentiary, in Puget Sound, near Tacoma, Washington.<br>
<br>
"I'll never serve it," Gardner muttered as sentence was pronounced and he was being led away.<br>
<br>
"Nobody ever beat McNeils yet," responded the guard.<br>
<br>
"No?" queried Gardner.  "Then maybe I better not go there.<br>
<br>
Despite his boast, by June 5, the mailbandit, in custody of deputy U. S. marshals, was on his way.  Being docile and a pleasant conversationalist, the guards were soon disarmed of any suspicion that he intended to try an escape.<br>
<br>
Just before the train rolled into East Portland, Oregon, Gardner and two Chinese dope peddlers, were being returned from the diner to their compartment.  The five men, including guards, had just gotten inside the drawing room when the prisoner leaned forward and
grabbed a gun from the holster of an officer. ,<br>
<br>
"Stick 'em- up," Gardner ordered.  "Get their keys Ah Wing and handcuff them to their berths."<br>
<br>
A few minutes later as the train slowed down for the stop at the station, Gardner and the Chinamen dropped off.  Now he became a much sought fugitive; he was real newspaper copy; a celebrity.<br>
He made good on his immediate getaway.  But early in May, 1921, the railway detectives and the postal inspectors got a rumor that Gardner had contacted his family in Napa, northern California.<br>
<br>
The officers tapped his telephone and heard him talk with his wife, who told him there was no hope for clemency, even ff he surrendered.  Gardner dearly, and that is the truth, loved his wife and family.  She made a date to meet him in a canyon north of town.<br>
<br>
The officers threw a cordon around the gulch, but the mail-bandit had become suspicious, and had phoned his wife after the tap was off.  He met her elsewhere.<br>
<br>
Gardner called his sentence a "bum rap"; he was particularly bitter about the length of his sentence.  Now he conceived a plan whereby he thought he might make a deal for clemency.  He telephoned the postal authorities and told them he would soon give them something to really want him for.  He also wrote this same threat to a San Francisco newspaper; they thought he was kidding.  What Gardner really meant to do was make himself such a pest in robbing the mails, that the authorities would be glad to make a deal with hir-q for clemency.<br>
<br>
On the evening of May 19, 1921, Gardner boarded the mail car of a Southern Pacific train when it stopped at Newcastle, California.  He tied up the clerk, Ralph Becker, and alighted from the car at Roseville, California, with one hundred and eighty-seven thousand dollars in cash and securities, in two hand bags.<br>
<br>
Two days later Gardner was taken into custody while playing a game of cards in a Roseville, California pool-hall.  He made no attempt to resist arrest; as a matter of fact he acted as though he rather expected it.  He told the postal inspectors he had robbed the mail in the hope that he would now have something with which to dicker for his freedom.<br>
<br>
"If you ever expect to see that money again you'll have to help me get that excessive sentence reduced," he said, and offered, for certain guarantees of assistance, to lead the officers to the
cache.  However, he must have decided he did not have a clemency offer from sufficiently high authority.  After leading the officers on a circuitous drive over the surrounding hills, he announced, "I guess I have forgotten where I buried that money."<br>
<br>
Roy Gardner again pled guilty to robbing the U. S. 'Mails and was given an additional twenty-five years at McNeill's Island.  On June 10, Deputy Marshals Mulhall and Rinckell set out from San Francisco with their prisoner.<br>
<br>
"You fellows will never get me to McNeil's," Gardner contemptuously remarked.  "I don't like that place and the sentence is too long.  I'll be leaving you somewhere along the line between here and Tacoma."<br>
<br>
The marshals' turn to smile now.  One escape was enough; they wouldn't be caught napping again.<br>
<br>
On the evening of June 12, the train having just crossed the Columbia River from Portland, Oregon, the scene of his previous escape, the guards were returning Gardner and an old-time convict, Norris H. Pyron, from the dining car to the sleeping compartment.<br>
During the meal Gardner had been in a jovial mood.  Next to him in the diner sat a pretty young lady he had been informed was a movie actress on her way to make some "shots" in the Northwest forests.<br>
<br>
"Keep your eyes open," said Gardner, without any attexnpt to keep the guards from hearing, "and you raay get soine real color for your next pilcture-if you want something sensational.  I'm leaving the train shortly.  These dicks don't believe me, but you watch; you won't be disappointed."<br>
<br>
The guards got a great kick out of the manner in which Gardner was kidding the showgirl.<br>
<br>
"Well, Roy" asked Mulhall, when they reached the compertinent, "when does it come off?"<br>
<br>
"It won't be long now," replied Gardner.  "Are you in a burry?<br>
<br>
You'll have to wait until I get back from the lavatory."<br>
<br>
"Going out the window?" asked the marshall.  "Better not try it; I know that old trick."<br>
<br>
Mulhall and Gardner had entered the compartment somewhat ahead of
Rincker and Pyron; the old convict had purposely made an excuse which detained the second guard.  Thus M@ and Gardner were alone as they stepped into the lavatory.  The convict bent over the wash basin; he was handcuffed but in such a position as he stood he could reach a weapon hidden beneath his clothing without attracting the marshal's attention.  As he straightened up Gardner stuck a gun against Mulhall's ribs.<br>
<br>
"Put 'em up, Mulhall!" he commanded.  "This is it!"<br>
<br>
"Quit your kidding, Gardner," answered the officer, without raising his arms.  "This isn't going to get you anywhere."<br>
<br>
"Put 'em," Gardner repeated forcefully.  "I mean it; I'm not fooling.  I was just waiting until we got across the Columbia River."<br>
<br>
Gardner, although handcuffed, disarmed the marshal and herded him !Lnto the compartment and waited for Rinckell; as he stepped through the door Gardner covered him.  Pyron took the deputies' keys and both convicts were soon free of their shackles; these were placed on Mulhall and Rinckell.<br>
<br>
The train had reached the yards in Vancouver, Washmgton.  Pyron was getting nervous.  Gardner bade him go through the window first.  Then following him over the ledge, he dropped to the ground. There he paused to remove the cartridges from a pistol which he threw into the compartment.<br>
<br>
"There's a souvenir for you, Mulhall," called the bandit, "and give my regards to the movie star."<br>
<br>
Roy Gardner had done it again! The newspaper's had his name across the top of the page in big letters that day. The marshals had made the fatal error of taking the word of local officers in San Francisco that the bandit had been carefully searched.  It looked as though McNeil's, the impregnable, was never to hold the slippery mail robber.<br>
<br>
Pyron was captured two days after the escape, at Kelso, fifty miles north of Vancouver.  He claimed he had helped Gardner make the break because Gardner had told him he had a gun, and would shoot him if he would not assist.<br>
<br>
Within the next few days rumors came in from many points that Gardner had been sighted, but it remained for a city patrolman Louis Sonny, to gather the authentic information of the escaped
man's whereabouts.  This came to the officer through the keen-eyed vigilance of Mrs. Myron Howell, proprietress of the Oxford HoteL in the railroad town of Centralia, Washington, a hundred miles north of Portland, Oregon.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Howell mued Patrolman Sonny's attention to a roomer who remained in quarters most of the day, and who had his head and arms swathed in bandages.  The <B>man</B> claimed he had been severely burned, but when Mrs. Howell purposely bumped against the severely injured arm and noted there was no cry of pain, she became more than ever suspicious. The roomer was about the mm height and build of Gardner, about whom she had been reading much in the newspapers.<br>
<br>
Sonny sent for Marshal Mulhall; together the two men went to the hotel.  A man stood m the hallway as they came up the stairs; he had plenty of time to prepare a defense as the marshal approached him, if he cared to do so.  Instead he walked into his room and sat down on the edge of the bed.  Mulhall followed him and accused him of being Gardner' The swathed man tried to convince Mulhall that he was mistaken, but it was of no use.  Mulhall knew his man, so again the mail robber was in custody.<br>
<br>
This time there was no escape.  Heavily ironed, wearing an Oregon-boot, Roy Gardner reached Tacoma, Washington, on June 17, 1921, and just as the sun was setting over Puget Sound he stepped onto the Federal launch which was to convey him to McNeil's, that island prison surrounded by an expanse of icy water and swfft tidal currents which made escape seemingly im ossible.  Up to this date McNeill's Island had never been beaten by a prisoner.<br>
<br>
"I'll never serve it," Gardner grimly reiterated to Mulhall, as he was turning him over to Warden Maloney's care.  "I have never so much as fired at a man in my life, and if the government had played square with me I would not be here now."<br>
<br>
A few days later Gardner's wife arrived in the Northwest and began a campaign to get sympathy for the lessening of her husband's time.  He was an enigma, she said, even to her, and really needed hospitalization.  People were amazed when they learned the curious pattern of his life.<br>
<br>
Roy Gardner, was born the son of a prosperous Detroit merchant-capitalist.  He had a college education and his youth had been spent in training for a career as a college professor.<br>
Drifting away from home he went to Mexico, and was sentenced to death as a revolutionist.  He escaped from prison and made his way to the west coast.<br>
<br>
Under the name "Young Fitzsimmons" he fought in the prize ring in
Oregon, Washington, Nevada and California.  As "Ben Lomond" he was one of the sparring partners of James J. Jeffries while the ex-champion prepared for his battle with Jack Johnson, at Reno, Nevada, in July of 1910.<br>
<br>
Not long after this chapter in his Iffe had closed, he was convicted of robbing a jewelry store in Californa, and under the name Sam Cox, sentenced-to five years in San Quentin.  Toward the end of the first year of his incarceration a riot occurred, and while defending a prison guard, he was severely stabbed.  VIhen he recovered he was released as a reward for his services in the disturbance.<br>
<br>
Now he married and was doing fairly well when he got a letter from a sister who was badly in need of assistance.  He had saved some money, according to his wife, and he sent her two hundred dollars by registered mail, but when she got the letter the money was gone.  Gardner tried to recover from the government, but, because he was an ex-convict, he said, he received scant sympathy; the authorities didn't believe his story.<br>
<br>
It was while angered over the rejection of his claim, according to his wife, that he stole the maflpouch in San Diego.  Following his escape at East Portland, Oregon, he returned to the East, and under the name C. E. Patterson<br>
<br>
He took up the vocation for which he had been trained, becoming a professor in a college at Davenport, Iowa.  When a train at Centervflle, in that state was robbed of $54,000, whether guilty or not, Professor Patterson disappeared.<br>
<br>
He never admitted his gufft in this robbery, but authorities say he robbed the train, and escaped from the scene in an airplane.<br>
A month later Roy Gardner was back in Calffornia.  Then came the Newcastle robbery, the capture in Rosevflle, and his escape at Vancouver, the recapture at Centralia, and his final incarceration at McNeils.<br>
<br>
"Will McNeil's hold Gardner?" was a question asked by many after he began his sentence.  "No," said civilans, "Yes," said officers.  The answer was not long in coming.<br>
<br>
On the afternoon of Labor Day, September 5,1921, Gardner sat in the back row of the bleachers at the prison athletic field watching a baseball game between two prison teams.  On one side sat Lawardus Bogart, and on the other Everett Impyn, soldiers from nearby Fort Lewis, who had been sentenced for a criminal assault on an army
nurse.<br>
<br>
It was three-thirty o'clock.  The score was six to four.  Two men were on bases and twp were out.  A heavy hitter was at the bat; If he hit it meant at least a tie and possibly a one-run lead for the team behind.  But it meant far more than that to Roy Gardner and the two desperate lifers who sat beside him-it could mean freedom.<br>
<br>
"Strike one," called the umpire, and the crowd yelled.  Gardner, having dropped to the ground behind his comrades, snipped away with a pair of stolen phers at the strands of the barbed-wire fence.<br>
"Strike two," was called, and again the convicts cheered.  This time Gardner completed his snipping.<br>
<br>
The pitcher delivered the ball, and the batter connected; far out into center field the sphere soared-everyone was screaming madly.  The guards in the towers had their eyes on the ball and the runners.<br>
<br>
"Now," said Gardner and the three men crawled through the hole in the fence; they were on the other side before a guard in a tower spotted them.<br>
<br>
Gardner's plan of escape was as simple as it was daring; ff he could make a nearby pasture lot he could mingle with the livestock and use them for -shelter as he ran for the timber, five hundred yards away. Before any of the trio could reach the prison herd bullets were kicking up the dirt about their heels.<br>
<br>
Following the fence until they reached the southwestern corner of the field, the trio made a dash across the pasture lot toward the timber.  Before they had gone twenty steps Impyn fell.  Gardner returned and knelt beside the fallen lad. He was dead.<br>
<br>
Gardner arose, and in a veritable rain of lead, raced for the cows.  Once among them he placed a hand on the back of a gentle bomy, and urged her toward the timber.<br>
<br>
He had almost reached his coveted goal when a bullet from a Springfield tore through his left leg and he went down.  At almost the same tixne he saw Bogart fall, waving weakly for him to go on.<br>
Gardner, with blood streaming down his pants leg, found he could stand.  One last dash and he was in the woods;<br>
<br>
where he fell on his face as the fire of the guards raked the timber above him.  Darkness fell and still no one had found his
hiding place.<br>
<br>
Within ten minutes after the break prison launches carrying guards scoured the beaches and confiscated every boat on the shoreline; there seemed no hope for escape by water.  When daybreak carne, Gardner was still at liberty.<br>
<br>
Warden Maloney believed Gardner was still on the island, but as September 6-7 passed, and not a single trace of the escapee had been found, he began to doubt his conclusions.<br>
<br>
McNeil's Island is not large four miles long and two miles wide.  Pitts Passage on the west was the narrowest body of water, but there the tide flowed like a millrace, and was icy cold.  Drayton Pass on the south was wide and commanded by a view from. the prison towers, and if the bandit should negotiate that point he would still be on Anderson Island, some distance from the mainland.<br>
<br>
North and east, Fox Island was two and one-half miles from Mc-
Neil's, but about halfway across was a solitary rock Imown as Mosquito; here a man might pause.  Is seemed improbable a wounded convict would choose that long route.  And, in any event all these passages were patrolled and guarded every minute of the day and night.<br>
<br>
Two more frantic days of search slipped by.  On the third night, @n Guard Charles McLean fired six shots at a hen-house robber at the ranch of Bert Hammer.  The next day a blood soaked piece of prison cloth was found.<br>
<br>
"He's still on the Island," Warden Maloney declared.  "He couldn't have made it to the mainland." Yet it seemed impossible for one man on such a small island to have so long eluded the pursuing forces.  The theory that he had escaped was strengthened when on September 14 a Seattle newspaper received a letter, which read:<br>
<br>
"I am in Seattle today; Yakimama tomorrow, then East.  Come and get me you sleepy dicks.  I paid for my getaway.  Charge it to Maloney.-Roy Gardner.<br>
<br>
There was evidence to support the authenticity of this letter.  A week before Gardner's escape Federal officers had been called in to investigate the cashing of certain bonds stolen in the Newcastle robbery which were showing up in Olympia.  These bonds, they learned were being disposed of through a certain Olympia, Washington, bank, (now defunct).<br>
<br>
Trailing the source of the bonds, a few of them were found buried beneath the "Log Cabin," a bootlegging joint, five miles north of Olympia.  The cabin was but a short ways from the shores of the
Sound, and less than fifteen miles from the Federal penitentiary on McNeil's.<br>
<br>
These bonds were supposed to have been brought to the "Log Cabin" by a confederate of Gardner's who had recently arrived from California.  Despite a different story of his escape, which Gardner later told, officers believe the bonds were given in return for a midnight boat ride and automobile ride which the mail bandit took about the time of his escape.<br>
<br>
Two more weeks passed and the authorities had to admit the Gardner had probably gotten off the Island.<br>
<br>
Remembering Gardner's preference for small cities, police of towns in Washington, were very vigilant.  Particularly so was Chief of Police George Shumway, of Raymond, a saw-mill port, one hundred and fifty miles south of Tacoma.<br>
<br>
Living in Raymond was a man known to have worked with Gardner when he was a railroader; this information was relayed to Chief Shumway, but, although he immediately began to cheek, by the time he had definite information of where Gardner was hid out in Raymond, the bandit had disappeared.<br>
<br>
In the room where Gardner had been secreted by his friend, Chief Shumway found a pad of paper on which a letter had been written.  Imprints of the words remained on the top sheet of the pad; a pencil had been used with considerable pressure.  This letter was addressed to the San Francisco Examiner, and a copy of it appeared on the next day.<br>
<br>
The letter, from Gardner, addressed to President Harding, appealed for clemency, if he would give himself up and return the money he had stolen from the mails.<br>
<br>
Gardner claimed he had hidden in the brush until night on the first day of his escape, and had then sneaked into the prison barn.  The bullet had drilled cleanly through the bone of his left leg, but had not broken it.  The wound was painful, but he could walk.  He slept in the barn loft and milked the cows for sustenance.<br>
<br>
On the night of Thursday, September 8, he sneaked out of the barn, and made his way half across the island by crawling more than walking.  The next day he lay motionless in one spot; that night he reached the northeastern shore of McNeill's opposite Fox Island.<br>
<br>
"I swam from McNeill's to Fox Island that night, drifting part of the time with the tide.  It took me a long while to make that two
and one-half miles, but the cold water felt good on my wounded leg, and I held out," Gardner said in the letter.  It appeared that by performing the seemingly impossible Gardner had left the Isand at the most unlikely and least guarded point.<br>
<br>
The next night Gardner swam from Fox Island to the mainland.  Then he made his way to Raymond, just how, none will ever know.  He left that city in a stolen automobile, and intimated he was on his way to Mexico.<br>
<br>
Nothing more was heard from Gardner until November 3, 1921, when a lone bandit held up the Southern Pacific train at Maricopa, Arizona.  Was it Gardner? The mail clerk thought so, judging from appearances and action.  No loot was taken in this attempt.<br>
<br>
The night of November 15 rolled around.  Mail Clerk Herman F. Inderlied stepped off the train at Phoenix, Arizona, to post a 
letter.  As he crawled back into his <B>car </B>he faced a man with a gun, and was told to back against the wall.  The bandit ordered Inderlied to raise his hands, but the clerk dived head-first.  In the struggle which ensued he got a good hold on the bandit's wrist, and although the gun was discharged no one was hit.<br>
<br>
Inderlied was a powerful man; he disarmed the robber and held him for the police.  He had captured Roy Gardner, whose gun had been loaded with wooden bullets.<br>
<br>
This time there was no escape.  Another twenty-five years was added to Gardner's sentence and he was taken to Leavenworth (Kansas) Federal Penitentiary.  Later he was removed to Atlanta Federal Prison, persisting that pressure at the base of his brain was driving him mad.<br>
<br>
No one seemed to believe his statement and the prison surgeons did not operate.  Gardner once again decided to take matters into his own hands.  With Joe Urbaytis, serving life for mail robbery, each man carrying a .25 caliber automatic pistol, they tried to place a wooden ladder against the prison wall, using unarmed Captain John Parker for a shield.<br>
<br>
The ladder was too short, and the men decided to go through the gates.  They demanded the keys of the guard who pulled them from his pocket and threw them on the opposite side of the iron bars.<br>
<br>
Urbaytis fired, or tried to fire, but the pin clicked on a defective cartridge and the guard's life was spared.  Captain Parker continued to talk to Gardner, urging him to give up the attempted escape.  Finally, seeing the uselessness of the thing,
Gardner tossed the gun to the pleading captain.<br>
"You win," said the smiling bandit, as he surrendered.<br>
<br>
Roy Gardner spent twenty months in solitary confinement for that frustrated attempt to escape.  He came out of the "hole" a living skeleton, and almost a maniac, still babbling about a pain in the back of his head.<br>
<br>
"Professor" Gardner was for sometime confined in the government's St. Elizabeth Hospital for the Insane, at Washington, D. C. and was then removed to Alcatraz to complete his sentence.<br>
<br>
Thus ended a criminal career which has no counterpart in American bandit history.  And somewhere, probably, approximately $250,000 of 
his loot still lies hidden.  Certainly he disposed of only <B>a </B>small part of it himself, for he had neither the time nor the opportunity 
to do <B>so, </B>and he had no partners to share it with; none, except in 
his sensational escapes, where <B>he </B>had to have help.<br>
<br>
He made many futile appeals for clemency, but was not released 
until 1939.  He ended his own life in a <B>small </B>hotel room in San Francisco, executing himself with cyanide gas, dropping the pellets 
into the wash basin in a tightly closed bathroom.  He left <B>a </B>letter in which he explained his act:<br>
<br>
"All men who have to serve more than five years in prison are 
doomed, but they don't realize it .... There <B>is</B> a barrier between the ex-convict and society that cannot be leveled.<br>
<br>
"Please let me down as light as possible, boys.  I have played ball 
with you all the <B>way, </B>and now you should pitch me a slow one and let me hit it.<br>
<br>

"I am checking out <B>simply because </B>I am old and tired, and don't care to continue the struggle.<br>
<br>

"I hold no malice toward any human being, and <B>I </B>hope those whom I 
have wronged win forgive me <B>for </B>it."<br>
<br>
"Good-bye."<br>

Two inmates who piloted a prison boat to escape from McNeil<br>
Island Corrections Center Friday remained at large yesterday, a<br>
corrections-department spokesman said.<br>
<br>
John Carter, 31, and Wallace Krahn, 35, were discovered missing<br>
Friday, said prison spokesman Veltry Johnson. Corrections Department officials contacted police agencies to assist with a search after Tacoma police reported at 7 p.m. that a prison boat had been found near the eastern side of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge.<br>
<br>
Carter was convicted of forgery in Lewis County and of auto<br>
theft in King County. Krahn was convicted of assault in Clark County.<br>
Both should be considered dangerous because they are fleeing,<br>

TACOMA - A convicted rapist apparently slipped into a semi-trailer<br>
loaded with furniture, was carried on a barge bound from McNeil Island Corrections Center to the mainland, then squeezed through a 14-inch hole in the floorboard.<br>
<br>
After crawling from the truck when it stopped south of Tacoma,<br>
Timothy Webb apparently made his way onto the campus of Steilacoom<br>
High School, where he found an unlocked school van with the keys in the ignition and a purse with cash inside, said prison officials who were still piecing together the Wednesday escape.<br>
<br>
Webb, 34, was serving a 54-year sentence for rape and other crimes<br>
and is considered extremely dangerous, the state Department of<br>
Corrections said.<br>
<br>
"He's not a nice guy based on his record. He's exactly the kind of<br>
guy we don't want escaping," said Corrections Secretary Chase Riveland.<br>
<br>
The escape marked the fourth time Webb has broken free of custody in Washington state:<br>
<br>
--  In 1977 Webb escaped from the Spokane County Jail, where he was<br>
being held in connection with a car theft. He was recaptured and<br>
sentenced to 2 to 10 years in prison for auto theft and jail break.<br>
<br>
--  He was convicted in Benton County in 1982 of theft, possession<br>
of stolen property and attempting to elude police. He was sentenced to 3 3/4 to 10 years.<br>
<br>
While serving that term, he escaped on Jan. 3, 1987, from the Tacoma pre-release center near Western State Hospital. He was recaptured just 24 hours later, but not before he went on a violent crime spree that led to charges including the rape of a 24-year-old Kirkland woman, attempted kidnapping, possession of stolen property and burglary.<br>
<br>
--  While awaiting trial for those crimes, Webb escaped from the<br>
King County Jail. He was recaptured in Pierce County, convicted and<br>
sent to McNeil Island in November 1987 to serve a 54-year sentence.<br>
<br>
He was held in medium security at the island west of Tacoma, prison<br>
officials said.<br>
<br>
Webb was discovered missing from the prison at a 4 p.m.<br>
Wednesday head count. He is believed to have left the island several hours earlier, on the 11:30 barge, said McNeil Superintendent Eldon
<br>
Vail.<br>
<br>
The boat arrived at the mainland shortly after noon, and the truck<br>
drove to a Corrections warehouse south of Tacoma where furniture<br>
manufactured by convicts is held for shipment. The school district van was stolen at about the same time.<br>
<br>
A man matching Webb's description was seen driving the van at about<br>
12:45 p.m. Wednesday. Pierce County sheriff's deputies found the<br>
vehicle abandoned at about 5 p.m. in the Tacoma suburb of Lakewood.<br>
<br>
Authorities are urging citizens to call police immediately if they<br>
spot Webb. He is about 5 feet 11, 141 pounds. He also has a two-inch scar on the left side of his face and a tattoo on his back that reads " Mouse."<br>
<br>
Webb's escape was the third at McNeil Island since June. A violent<br>
offender was at large for several weeks after escaping in June, and a convicted drug dealer was plucked by corrections officers from Puget Sound within five hours of his escape July 15.<br>
<br>
Johnson said security procedures were changed at the prison after<br>
the first two escapes, but he declined to give specifics.<br>
<br>

"McNeil Island escapee has violent record," <B>The Seattle Times.</B> October 15, 1992 p. B-2.<br>
<br>
Authorities are on the lookout for an inmate with a record of<br>
violence who escaped yesterday afternoon from McNeil Island<br>
Penitentiary.<br>
<br>
The inmate was identified as Timothy Webb, 34, who was not<br>
scheduled to be released until 2026, according to Nedra Reed, a<br>
penitentiary administrator.<br>
<br>
Webb was sent to prison in 1982 after convictions for rape,<br>
burglary, assault and attempted kidnapping in Benton County, Reed said.<br>
<br>
He had been at McNeil since 1987. He may have escaped by hiding in a
freight van, Reed said.<br>
<br>
Webb was discovered missing at 4 p.m. yesterday,  He has brown hair<br>
and brown eyes and was wearing a khaki shirt and pants. Anyone with<br>
information should call 911.<br>

RUSTLING<br>
<br>
Elgin V. Kuykendall," Cattle Rustling," <B>History of Garfield County.</B> Fairfield: Ye Galleon Press, 1984, p. 78-79.<br>
<br>
Cattle rustling and horse stealing were common offenses in Garfield County in the early nineties, as well as in other parts of Eastern Washington.  The vigilante days were on the wane at that time, and while many offenders were detected and punished, a goodly number were never apprehended.<br>
<br>
A bold gang of rustlers was organized, apparently in Dayton, in the early nineties and operated successfiilly for a considerable time, though beef steers were selling at that time at ten to fifteen dollars per head.  They carried on their criminal trade with a type of efficiency worthy of a better cause.<br>
<br>
One member of the gang, George Young, established a slaughter house on the Patit Creek above Dayton, and operated a retail meat market at Dayton.  Cattle were stolen by other members of the band in Columbia, Garfield and Asotin Counties, and many of them were taken to Youngs slaughter house, where they were butchered, the tell-tale hides, bearing the brands of the owners, were boxed and the meat retailed at Young's shop.<br>
<br>
When a considerable number of cattle were stolen, the cows, calves and range stock, as well as the beeves in excess of the local demand at the Dayton market, were assembled and shipped, usually at Lewiston, Idaho or Dayton, Wash.<br>
<br>
Young was finally trapped convicted, and served a term in the penitentiary.  He failed to implicate any of his associates, as the code of the outlaw gangs provided that any member who "squealed" on any other member was to be hunted down and shot on sight.<br>
<br>
I have read and heard so many different versions about the capture of the remainder of the gang that it seems impossible to glean facts from fiction.  I have never read or heard any two accounts that were even similar as to details. However, from the best information available, the main facts are about as follows: A.H. Weatherford was Sheriff of Columbia County at the time, and Albert Allen was his Deputy.<br>
<br>
Billie Lloyd was working in Sheriff Weatherford's livery stable and one day indiscreetly remarked to Deputy Albert Allen that he had quit work and that he was going to wear diamonds or shackles.<br>
<br>
Allen replied, "You'll probably wind up wearing shackles." Lloyd answered, "If I do, you'll not put them on me." This reckless talk of course, made Lloyd a suspect.  For some tune the farmers and stockmen of Columbia, Garfield and Asotin Counties had suffered
seriously from the depreciations of cattle rustlers.<br>
<br>
As a result, the officers had been quietly investigating and discovered facts which convinced them that a well-organized gang of cattle thieves composed mainly of men residing in and around Dayton had been operating with skill and efficiency.  Clues seemed to point to Billie Lloyd, Bud Pettijohn, Chan Taylor and John Long.<br>
<br>
In the summer of 1894, these men made arrangements to deliver a car-load of cattle to John Church at Dayton, whenever Church was ready to make shipment.  It appears that the cattle were to be delivered to Church at the Fred Gritman ranch on the Tucannon.<br>
<br>
Whether Church knew the men were rustlers and was helping to trap them, or whether he believed them to be on the square at the time seems uncertain.  At any rate, Lloyd, Taylor and Pettijohn were seen driving 30 head of cattle belonging to John Powell of Asotin County, toward the Tucannon.<br>
<br>
One version is that Church joined them on the drive to inspect the cattle and assist in moving them, and that he became suspicious that the cattle were stolen and went to the Lee place on the Alpowa (now the Ralph Stemlier Ranch) and hired Ed Munch, who was at the place to carry a note to Gilbert Dickson, Sheriff Tom Burlingame, Lew Tidwell, Sam Shawley and Peter Sutter, who were joined by Deputy Allen from Dayton.<br>
<br>
These officers were apparently uncertain whether the rustlers would take the upper road through the Peola Country, or take the main road up the Alpowa, past the Lee place.  The account of the capture of the rustlers given by Deputy Allen after he refumed to Dayton August 5, 1894, as published in the Columbia Chronicle was about as follows:<br>
<br>
In company with the sheriff of Garfield County, two deputies and four citizens, we went to a place at the head of the Alpowa, as we expected the gang to come along that evening.  They did not appear, but last evening just as we had finished supper, at the Freeman [Lee] place, Lloyd and Pettijohn came riding along.  Knowing Lloyd well, I called him by name, told him to throw up his hands and consider himself under arrest.<br>
<br>
He pulled his gun, dropped over on the other side of his horse and commenced shooting.  We fired three shots at his horse, and he started to run, firing at me continuously.  Lloyd had previously told others that if hc and I ever came together that way he would have to kill me.<br>
<br>
Pettijohn also dismounted and started to run, firing at the officers.  Twice Lloyd came near hitting me, shooting once under my left arm, and once just to the right making this hole.<br>

Here Allen pointed to two holes in his left pantaloon leg, just below the knee.  One bullet made both holes and cut the underclothing, but did not touch the flesh.  Allen continued:<br>
<br>
After a 200-yard chase, Lloyd and Pettijohn surrendered.  Lloyd had two flesh wounds, below and above the left knee.  Pettijohn was shot twice with a Winchester in the left thigh.  The wound is a bad one and the leg will probably have to be amputated.  None of the officers were hit.<br>
<br>
We then went on down the canyon several miles and captured Chan Taylor, another of the gang who was driving the cattle.  I rode up along side of him and shoved a pistol under his nose.  He saw there was no chance to escape and threw up his hands.  We took the prisoners to Pomeroy, where they could receive medical attention, arriving there about 2 o'dock this morning.<br>
<br>
It is claimed that in addition to the 30 head of John Powell's cattle, they had stolen 30 others which they were driving.<br>
<br>
Judge M.F. Gose of Pomeroy was employed to conduct the prosecution of the rustlers by the county commissioners of Asotin County, as this herd of cattle was stolen in that county.  Lloyd was tried and convicted at Asotin in April 1895 and was sentenced by judge R.M. Sturdevant to three years in the penitentiary.<br>
<br>
Chan Taylor entered a plea of guilty at the same term of court and was given a like sentence.  Pettijohn was tried at the same term and, strange as it may seem, was acquitted.  Since he was crippled for life by his wounds, from which he nearly died and had served several months in jail, perhaps the jury concluded he had been sufficiently punished.<br>

<br>
There was a time when strangers, viewing horses walking in the middle of the Columbia River, thought they were witnessing an unbelievable phenomenon.  What they really saw were seiners at work on the submerged sand bars.<br>
<br>

Commercial fishing was done in three different ways, with <B>-Vii</B> nets traps, and horse-drawn seines copied after the long fiber drag nets of the Indians.  The traps and the seines brought activity to the river shoals.  The men working these types of gear lived in bunkhouses erected on stilts.  Horses that pulled the seines likewise were lodged in stables high up on piling, at Desdemona Sands and Sand Island.<br>
<br>
Oregon owns most of the low sandy spits and bars, including Sand Island in Ilwaco's harbor, close to the Washington shore.  It took a Supreme Court decision to settle which state controlled it.  Older residents remember when Sand Island was farther out in the stream, but channels and shoals have shifted constantly since the Columbia was first charted.  These changes have, in turn, resulted in fresh hazards to navigation.<br>
<br>
The shoals were marvelous places for catching salmon.  White men fashioned their drag seines six times longer than those of the Indians, holding them upright with lead lines along the bottom and cedar floats on the upper side.<br>
<br>
Where Indians held one end of the seine on shore and took the other end into the current by canoe, white fishermen used a stout boat to lay the net and a towline, pulled by teams of horses, to drag it in.  The boatman would bring the line to the driver and the horses did the rest.  Each year some animals drowned when the strong current pulled them into the river beyond their depth.<br>
<br>
Men and horses worked in water two to three feet deep, and it appeared as though the teams were being driven where no land existed.  Drag seines brought in about sixteen per cent of the Columbia's salmon catch.  The fish were of top quality, with no damage to gills or marks from nets, and they sold for high prices on the frozen-fish and "mild-cure" markets.<br>
<br>
Mild curing, a German method, was developed on the Oregon side of the river, beginning in 1897.  Large, fat, unbruised salmon were selected and scored slightly to permit the pickle to <B>penetrate; and they were not so heavily salted as</B> other salmon.  The pickled fish were then shipped to Europe, where they were smoked before being, offered to consumers.<br>

They are the fish served at cocktail buffets and smorgasbords.  The height of seining was reached in 1926, when this type of gear caught 5,802,069 pounds of salmon.  The greatest number of drag seines ever to operate at one time was fifty seven.  As soon as the season was over, the surviving horses were moved from the seining grounds and turned out to pasture for the other eight months of the year.  Many showed no ill effects from working season after season.<br>
<br>
Gill nets reached the Columbia with the first American fishermen, who employed the gear familiar to them on the east coast.  They learned to adapt the mesh to the type of fish they wished to catch.<br>
<br>
Most of Ilwaco's fishermen were gill-netters whose working hours depended upon the tides, for at slack water the salmon were most easily caught.  Because the best fishing ground was close to the bar, it was customary to take a station out in the river, let the net run over the stern at ebb, and drift down toward the mouth.  The boats returned on the flood tide.  Danger lay in reaching the bar too quickly@r in venturing too far out when the salmon were extra plentiful.<br>
<br>
To row a heavily laden twenty-four-foot boat against a tide rushing seaward at the rate of eight knots taxed the strength of the fishermen, and accidents occurred constantly.  The season of 1880 was an especially unfortunate one, with many scattered drownings and a loss of at least nineteen men in a sudden tragic storm which blew up on the night of May 3-4.<br>
<br>
Between 100 and 150 gill-net boats left the cannery slips on both sides of the river that evening, with small triangular sails hoisted.  Low tide was due just before midnight.  Some boats were lined up at the outer end of Sand Island, and others were off 
Chinook Point when a southwest gale struck, accompanied by <B>snow 
</B>squalls.<br>
<br>
Fishermen had just put out their nets and the intervals between gusts were so brief that they could not haul in again.  AH they could do was attempt to reach shore.  Boat after boat overturned, spilling men.  Weeks passed before au the bodies were recovered.<br>
Exaggerated reports of the number of drownings persisted.  It was believed at first that a hundred men had been lost.  By the following year the figure had doubled in the telling and retelling of events taking place that night when so many vessels swamped or were overturned.<br>
<br>
Almost as many fishing boats as men were casualties, the number of craft being placed at around fifteen.  A boat puller, presumed dead, reappeared a year later, having been picked up outside the bar by a vessel bound for Australia.  He was carried to the South Pacific and found his way back as a sailor on another ship.<br>
<br>
On May 4, the storm calmed and the treacherous lull enticed many fishermen to venture forth again, only to put in another frightful
night.  Two fishing vessels turned upside down, but the lifeboat from Cape Disappointment followed them to sea and picked up the men near a buoy.<br>
<br>
A man who lived on Sand Island during that stormy season remembered how thickly nets were strewn there after blows, sometimes with bodies tangled in them.  Throughout the <B>summer</B>, dead fishermen floated in on peninsula beaches because of the unusually high number of drownings.  Some were the result of the fatal windstorm; others occurred when men fell overboard under normal weather conditions.  The captain of the Cape Disappointment lifesaving crew was often kept as busy on a good day by distressed fishermen as when storms raged.<br>
<br>
Gill-netting was not only a risky means of making a living but also a source of hazards to navigation.  The steamboat General Canby, carrying the mail, spent so much time dodging nets that, in 1881, a false bow was built on her so that she could pass over them.  In that year approximately five hundred gill-net boats fished between Astoria and the bar.<br>
<br>
In heavy runs, such as in 1883, on the first day a typical boat brought in eighty-five salmon, paid for at seventy-five cents apiece.  By mid-July the supply of cans ran short; canneries were accepting only as many fish as they could pack and companies that lacked cans had their crews spend part of every day making more.  The run never diminished but the price dropped to thirty cents a fish, with boats bringing in as many as a hundred big salmon in a day.<br>
<br>
Already wise heads were wondering how long these riches could last.<br>
<br>
An even greater threat of extermination reached the river in 1879 when Oliver P. Graham initiated another way of fishing, constructing a trap in Baker Bay similar to ones he had seen on the Great Lakes.  A difference of opinion exists as to exactly where the first trap was erected.<br>
<br>
Graham's nephew said it was between Fort Canby and Ilwaco, but another informant said it was opposite the present Gile's barn at Chinook.  The nephew was probably right because, while the trap was under construction, men arrived at work one April morning to find<br>
the steamship Great Republic wrecked directly in front of the site-and the vessel went aground on Sand Island.<br>
<br>
The following spring of 1880, other members of Graham's family erected three more traps, one of them on Sand Island.  They all proved successful and, by 1889, the traps in the bay totaled 121.  By 1900, approximately five hundred were strung out between Fort Canby and Point Ellice.<br>

In the beginning, piling to hold the webs was hand driven and much of it was removed before winter.  Later, power operated pile drivers did the work, and the timbers were left in place.  The traps reached out from shore, leading upstream bound fish into a heart and finally into a pot, from which they were lifted with a spiner and dumped into the holds of cannery pick-up boats.<br>
<br>
Having been on the river earlier than the trap men, gillnetters resented these monster contrivances for catching the salmon horde.  In 1884, they organized to drive out the big webs, declaring they were being robbed of their livelihood.  The traps were at choice locations where usually the best drifts (with gill nets) had been made.<br>
<br>
This marked the beginning of night raids, when mooring lines of pile drivers were cut, setting them adrift and damaging the traps.  Each trap had a watchman living in a shack either on piles or on shore; therefore efforts were directed toward terrorizing him.<br>
Many gill-netters lived in Ilwaco, and the town's rough reputation grew out of their part in the gill-net wars, which lasted from 1884 well into the 1900s.<br>
<br>
Among the first of these episodes was an attack on a watchman named Miller, who was employed on Fred Colbert's pile driver.  Colbert, a Swede, had arrived on the Lower Columbia in 1866.  Miller, recently from Kansas, was terribly frightened one night when gill-netters boarded the fish trap, put a rope around his neck, and threatened to hang him to the gins-the big rigs that held the driver.<br>
<br>
Miller talked them out of the hanging but they took him in a gill-net boat to a freight scow moored near Sand Island, saying they were shanghaiing him.  The scow had two large masts, and in the darkness Miller was convinced it was a ship and that his assailants really were intent on the nefarious business which thrived on Astoria's waterfront.<br>
<br>
They ordered him on board the "ship," then pulled away quickly to<br>
cut the Colbert trap, undisturbed by a watchman.<br>
<br>
Will Graham, who owned the freight scow, went on deck to investigate the commotion.  Miller demanded the name of the vessel and her destination.<br>
<br>
"When I enlightened him," Graham said, "he was tickled to death to find he wasn't headed for a long sea voyage.  After that night he never went back on the water again."<br>
<br>

The Graham trap was slashed and some of the piles were chopped off the same night, but the Grahams <B>didn't scare eas</B>ily<br>
<br>
"Nobody at the traps was prepared for trouble," Graham said.  "The gill-netters always tried to surprise us and we never knew how many would attack at one time.  The trap owners patrolled the rest of the season, using a boat, the Sea Foam, that did towing for the pile drivers.  A gun was borrowed from Fort Canby and mounted on deck, with railroad ties piled on either side.  The patrol went on for a couple of weeks, but all was quiet, although up river, around Rainier, several men were shot during attacks on traps."<br>
<br>
Graham told another story of Tom Tilson, an Indian employed by Fred Colbert to guard quantities of tarred web spread on racks in front of his Ilwaco home.  It was rumored that Astoria gill-netters might attempt to destroy them.  At the time, Colbert owned six fish traps.<br>
<br>
"If anyone molests you, shoot to kill," Colbert instructed Tilson.<br>
<br>
While having a drink that night, John King-the bookkeeper at the Aberdeen cannery-Archie Ross, and another friend decided it would be good sport to see how alert Colbert's watchman was.  Another version is that they were all friends of the owner and wanted to see if the nets were still unharmed.<br>
<br>
It was a dark night and they made the mistake of lighting matches@r perhaps they did it to worry Tilson.  The latter had taken Colbert's instructions seriously and when he saw flares in the vicinity of the tarred nets he opened fire immediately.  Three or four buckshot struck King, shattering an arm.  Ross was killed and the third man escaped.<br>
<br>
Colbert, hearing shots in front of his house, thought the Astoria crowd had arrived, and raced up the hill to borrow Whealdon's rifle.  When he got back the excitement was over.  The Pike family down the next block had taken in King and were trying to help him.  Everyone was shocked at what had happened to the cannery bookkeeper was a respected citizen and his friends were equally well thought of.  King lost part of his arm and his relish for practical jokes.<br>
<br>
The Colbert house, where the tragedy occurred, is one of the oldest and most picturesque residences in Ilwaco.  Two additions have been made to the original structure, which was built in 1883.  The house still belongs to the original owner's daughters.<br>
<br>
Trap troubles continued for years.  In 1887, seven traps were destroyed, representing a loss of more than fifteen thousand dollars.  The raid was made, as usual, at night, gill netters spreading word that they intended to destroy all of the traps on Baker Bay.  One man was killed and another was wounded.<br>

In April, 1896, Sand Island was fortified, the First Infantry of the Washington National Guard having been ordered to Ilwaco by Governor McGraw because of a strike by gill-netters and some trap men.  They were demanding five cents a pound on all salmon delivered at the canneries.<br>
<br>
Rumors spread that the cannery men were paying soldiers fifty cents a day and that they were on duty to enforce a four cents a pound rate on the fish.  Feeling ran high and Ilwaco citizens were convinced that only the presence of the troops averted destruction of the traps.<br>
<br>
Three forts were set up on Sand Island, the two outer ones being nicknamed Finstopper and Starvation.  The central fortification looked toward the sea and the tip of Clatsop Spit.  At low water, the soldiers could see the wreck of the steamer Great Republic whose boilers and upper works had been targets for Fort Canby gunnery practice.<br>
<br>
Another outpost, dubbed Paradise, was established close to Chinook, where the striking trap men lived.  A telephone line connected this camp with ]Ilwaco and Fort Canby, which relayed messages to other places, using code, in case conversations were intercepted.  A bicycle courier and the telegraph line from Cape Disappointment 
light house to Ilwaco extended the <B>line of</B> communications and surveillance.  The lighthouse commanded a broad view of the entire scene as far as Astoria.<br>
<br>
The soldiers were ordered to stop all boats going in and out of Baker Bay, and to ascertain the names of the passengers, the boat number, and its destination.  Any person landing on Sand Island was to be held for inspection by Sheriff Thomas Roney.  Three steam launches carrying six soldiers each were employed for night patrols.<br>
<br>
Striking fishermen were equally militant in their tactics.  Every troop movement was under close surveillance and was reported to union headquarters in Astoria, where the local press branded the militia "curs, cowards and tin soldiers." The more passionate strikers in Astoria clamored for an opportunity to visit Sand Island and annihilate the "hoodlums and bloodthirsty villains."<br>
<br>
A schooner-rigged boat, the Pathfinder, equipped with steel plates, loopholes in the bulwarks, and steam power for driving piles, was employed several times by the fishermen in committing depreciations along the river.  On May 8, it drew piles as a warning to one of the canneries which started operations.<br>
<br>
By then the militia had gone home to Seattle and federal troops had
taken over, because the ownership of Sand Island and the right of Washington to patrol Oregon territory was questioned.  The commander at Fort Canby enlarged the breastwork at Fort Starvation, using ties loaned by the railroad.<br>
<br>
After the piles had been pulled and the trap was destroyed at Desdemona Sands, a howitzer was set up, in case a similar attempt was made on the Washington shore.<br>
<br>
Salmon were running and Seaborg's cannery was operating in spite of the fear that Oregon strikers might prevent fishing in Baker Bay-as they had succeeded in doing on the Oregon side.  While Ilwaco escaped casualties, it was estimated that at least twenty persons lost their lives elsewhere on the river during the season's trap war.<br>
<br>
Oregon had to call out a full regiment of infantry and a light battery on June 16, and the guards in Washington finally were able to relax their vigilance.  Though the strike ended June 21 by secret union ballot, bitter feeling against the Baker Bay traps was not eradicated.  The gin-netters still were determined to destroy them, and the very next night a suspicious looking sailboat was sighted by the patrol vessel.<br>
<br>
Though shots were fired by the patrol, it was unable to overhaul the boat because of the gusty weather.  Patrolling continued until the salmon run ended, and 1896 was remembered on the river as its season of greatest lawlessness.<br>
<br>
Two years later the Seaborg cannery burned and for the next five years all trap fish caught by Ilwaco men were carried to Astoria for canning.  Then in 1903, McGowan built at Ewaco, in addition to his cannery at McGowan.<br>
<br>
In Seaborg's day, Chinese did afl the canning and making of cans, his thirty Orientals occupying an old building on a site west of town near the waterfront-which was often pointed out to visitors.  December, 1900, and February, 1902, brought heavy storms which wrecked mess houses along the river and uprooted large trees.  The "China house" at McGowan was undermined and had to be moved farther back into the meadow, out of reach of high water.<br>
<br>
"From all appearances it is to be feared that in a few years we shall all be obliged to take our last stand back upon the hills," was the Chinook Observer's comment on the extent of the erosion.  "A few old stumps are all that is left to remind our better halves of the places where they had their wash fines in the sweet long ago."<br>
<br>

A number of gill-netters who had taken refuge at the Fort Canby dock in the 1902 storm were out of luck, forty of them turning bottoms up.  The high wind that day around Chinook inspired a local jokester, Chris Olsen, to invent some original folklore.  He had a barrel of tar standing at the back of his house, he said, and the gale blew the hoops off both ends; and his brother's pet cat, left out all night, was shorn of her hair as neatly as though shaved.<br>
<br>
"I tried to take a chew of tobacco," Chris related, "but just as I opened my month a sudden squall struck me, turning my face inside out.  I had a horrible time getting it straightened out again."<br>
<br>
Traps continued to multiply until the north shore was so thick with them that there was barely room for steamships to enter the channel.  They extended from the mainland and from the south side of Sand Island.  The only restriction on them was a legal requirement that they be spaced six hundred feet apart.<br>
<br>
Most of Chinook's seven hundred inhabitants were earning their living from traps.  On the first day of the big July, 1901, run, an owner of five traps took ten thousand pounds of salmon.  The figure rose to twelve thousand pounds on the fifth day.  His average daily haul brought him five hundred dollars that season.  The fish were likened to free gold; as soon as a salmon was lifted from the water it turned into coin on the spot.<br>
<br>
A feature of the bay front in this era was the hundreds of tar tanks and net reels strung along the beach.  Nets had to be dipped to preserve them and dark color was important.  White mesh in the water would frighten the fish.  At first tan-bark peeled from hemlock was employed by the gill-netters for coloring; later blue stone was introduced.  Modern nylon gill nets need no dipping except a rare dunking in blue stone.<br>
<br>
Trap nets were the heaviest of all and these went into hot tar had to be drained and dried.  It was a blistering job handling them.  The men wore gum boots and slickers while they worked and usually returned home as black as the tar iq their 150-gallon cooking pots.  It required care to keep the giant kettles from boiling over and burning the net as it was being dipped.<br>
<br>

The web wound around a shaft, which let the excess tar drain into a trough before the mesh was spread on the ground to dry.<br>
<br>
The work was unpleasant, the fumes were almost unbearable, faces became peeled from the heat, and eyes stung from hot dust.  The men greased their skin with lard to prevent splashing tar from sticking.<br>
<br>
This was all part of the business, and smoking tar pots heralded preparations for the salmon season.  In years of big runs, the canneries could not pack all the fish that were caught at peak times and many salmon that were paid for had to be thrown overboard
because they could not be put into cans fast enough.<br>
<br>
Fights between gill-netters and fish-trap men resumed in 1905, but arbitration by a U. S. Army Engineers officer settled the trouble promptly.  In September of that year another disagreement broke out above Point Ellice, where piles were being driven for eight new trap locations.  Shots were fired and excitement prevailed until it was discovered that the rifles were carried by men who were ashore on an innocent bear hunt.<br>
<br>
Though ownership of Sand Island was settled in 1908, when the United States Supreme Court awarded it to Oregon, the land remained property of the federal government, which leased trap sites on bid.  Traps were banned in Washington in 1935 and in Oregon in 1948.<br>
<br>
Drag seines went out the same year and, with these changes, the picturesque barns and bunkhouses on stilts vanished.  Ilwaco citizens used to go dancing on Saturday nights at mess halls which stood where now there are only a few piles as reminders of once-busy summer communities surrounded by water.<br>
<br>
Ilwaco's young men do not like gill-netting and many have become deep-sea trollers.  Those with smaller boats have turned to charter trips for sports fishermen, taking clients several miles into the ocean in all directions.  Sometimes the fishing is especially good off Seaside, Oregon; and to go there they  must obtain a temporary fishing license required by Oregon law for salmon taken inside the three-mile limit.<br>
<br>
The Columbia River salmon harvest is dwindling, due to dams, trollers and sports fishing.  Nearly all of the commercial catch goes, not to canneries, but the fresh market.<br>
<br>
Back in 1900 the editor of the Chinook Observer wrote that nothing could stop the salmon from coming into the river or could increase or decrease their number.<br>
<br>
"As long as salmon run and there are stomachs to feed," he said,<br>
<br>
"the Columbia River fisherman will have a mine of wealth far surpassing in intrinsic value any gold mine on earth."<br>
<br>
How wrong he was!<br>

REPORT ON THE BAKER BAY (ILLWACO) FISHERIES INCIDENT<br>
HON. JOHN H. MCGRAW, GOVERNOR OF WASHINGTON<br>
Illwaco, 7 April 1896<br>
<br>
The undersigned, sheriff of Pacific county, in the State of Washington most respectfully represents:<br>
<br>
That on Friday, the third day of April, 1896, while about twenty fishermen, citizens of the State of Washington, were lawfully engaged in driving piles to be used in fish traps in the waters of Columbia River at a place called Baker's Bay, in Pacific County, Washington, a large number, to wit, between two hundred and three hundred men, most of whom are residents of Astoria, Oregon, armed with knives, hatchets and other deadly weapons, came with a steamboat and a large number of fish boats to the place where said men were so driving said piling, and forcibly violently and unlawfully by intimidation, threats and actual force and violence, compelled said men who were so lawfully engaged in driving piling, to pull piling from a number of lawful fish traps, which had been lawfully operated prior to 1896, and which owners intended to lawfully operate during the fishing season of 1896;<br>
<br>
That said men driving piling were working from three steam pile drivers, each of which consists of a boat about eighteen feet in width and about forty feet six inches in length, with steam pile driver and gear, and each of which is worth from $1,500 to $2,000; that said assailants, in large numbers, gathered in fish boats around about said three pile drivers and in large numbers boarded the same and by force overcame the men lawfully thereon;<br>
<br>
That said assailants attempted to and did do great damage to said pile driver boats, and did cut the ropes belonging to the same and cast overboard the anchors, and otherwise broke, injured and destroyed various parts of said pile drivers;<br>
<br>
That said assailants compelled said men to continue to pull said stakes as long as the pile drivers were in a condition to be used, and until the gearing to said pile drivers became broken by reason of rough usage at the hands of said assailants; that after said drivers could be no longer used, by reason of their broken condition, said assailants cut the ropes which held them in place and set said pile drivers, three in number adrift over the Columbia river bar, into the ocean, in order to destroy the same;<br>
That as two of the drivers were about to go over the bar a steamer belonging to P.J. McGowen & Sons caught them and towed them to a place of safety;<br>
<br>
That one of the drivers was cast upon the beach of said island at the mouth of the Columbia river; that on Monday the sixth day of April, 1896, said driver had not been saved although a large force
of men had been at work attempting to get the same off the sand and to a place of safety;<br>
<br>
That as to whether or not said driver or any part thereof has since been saved the undersigned is uninformed, but it is the opinion of the fishermen of said county that said driver cannot be saved, thereby causing a loss of about $1,500 to the owner who is a citizen of the state;<br>
<br>
That at same time and place, 3 April, said assailants knocked down, kicked and bruised and otherwise maltreated a number of said citizens of the state, and threatened to hang some of them to the said pile driver and set them adrift over the bar; that said assailants refused to allow any of the said citizens to return to the town of Illwaco (which was about three miles away) until after said drivers had been set adrift as aforesaid; that at said time and place said assailants informed said citizens that the fisherman's union, a powerful organization of the State of Oregon, composed of many hundreds of gill netters, was supporting them in said depredations, and that it was the intention of said assailants and of said union to prevent, by force and violence, the operation of any fish traps in Baker's Bay during the season of 1896;<br>
<br>
That they would come over in large numbers and destroy the drivers as often as our citizens attempted to use them, and that they would destroy the web, lawfully placed on the trap piling, as fast as they were placed thereon; that after said depredations had been committed a number of fish boats containing a large number of Oregon fishermen were lying in wait, near Sand Island in Pacific county, to destroy the property of our citizens as they would attempt to complete their traps;<br>
<br>
That said Oregon gill-netters have threatened to, and the undersigned and the fishermen along Baker's Bay believe they will, destroy and attempt to destroy the fish traps of our citizens in Baker's Bay; that on account of the peculiar situation and the character of the defense, the undersigned is unable to adequately or at all protect the property of the citizens of said county;<br>
<br>
That said Oregon gill-netters can and undoubtedly will make frequent incursions into the waters of said bay, and to a great extent destroy the fishing industry of the state, unless assistance is immediately rendered by he state;<br>
<br>
That the fishing season opens on 10 April 1896, but our fishermen, on account of the violence heretofore committed, and the threats made by said Oregon fishermen, and the inability of said sheriff to render adequate protection, dare not place their webs on the fish trap piling and dare not expose their property to the violence of said Oregon fishermen; that unless our fishermen are able to operate their traps during the whole season, they will be greatly and irreparably injured;<br>
<br>
That in Baker's Bay there are about 400 fish traps belonging to<br>
citizens and residents of the State of Washington, of the aggregate value of about $40,000;<br>
<br>
That the value of the pile drivers and the boats used in the construction and operation of said traps is about $50,000; that the approximate value of the fish caught per season is $400,000; that the fishing season is of only four months duration, from 10 April to 10 August; that for each trap a license of $10 is paid to the State of Washington;<br>
<br>
That great fear prevails among not only the fishermen of said county, but among the cannery men as well; that the fishing industry, which is the greatest industry of said country, is almost at a standstill, and the fishermen are now idle, whereas, except for the matters above stated, they would now be engaged in placing the web on their traps preparatory to the commencement of fishing on the 1Oth of April.<br>
<br>
WHEREFORE by reason of the matters and things herein stated the undersigned, as sheriff of said county, most respectfully calls upon the commander-in-chief for such aid as in his discretion is just, proper and adequate.<br>
<br>
(Signed) Thomas Roney, Sheriff of Pacific County.<br>

BRIGADE HEADQUARTERS, NATIONAL GUARD OF WASHINGTON<br>
Seattle, 15 April 1896<br>
<br>
Adjutant General, N.G.W., Olympia, Washington<br>
<br>
Sir:  I have the honor to report that in accordance with Special Orders No. 9 from general headquarters, dated 8 April 1896, I left Seattle at 12:20 P.M. of 9 April 1896, with a detachment of the First Infantry Regiment ordered to Illwaco, Washington, by Special Orders No. 9 from general headquarters, and proceeded to Illwaco, arriving there at 2 o'clock A.M. of Friday, 10 April 1896.<br>
<br>
No fishing was being done by the Illwaco fishermen and no preparations for fishing were being made by them, and there seemed to be some uncertainty as to what course should be pursued by them.  I learned that previous to my arrival a committee of the local fishermen's organization had been sent to a meeting of the fishermen's union at Astoria, and that at such meeting resolutions were adopted to the effect that members of the union would not engage in fishing the Columbia river until the price of five cents per pound for all fish delivered at the canneries on the river was assured.<br>
<br>
I was further informed that upon the return of this committee to<br>
Illwaco a meeting of the local fishermen was held and that the committee made a report to this meeting in favor of joining the Astoria fishermen in the strike which had then been inaugurated, and that the report was approved by the meeting.<br>
<br>
In a conference with Sheriff Roney regarding the situation on Saturday, April 11th, I was informed by him that the storm then prevailing prevented the fishermen from establishing their traps, and further, that the meeting to which the report of the committee had been made regarding the strike, was not a meeting of the local organization, but only of some of its members, and that the local organization would speedily define its position and prepare for active fishing operations on Monday.<br>
<br>
I informed Sheriff Roney that unless the local fishermen proposed to begin work as soon as the weather would permit, the force would be withdrawn.<br>
<br>
On Saturday night a meeting of the local fishermen's organization was held at which resolutions were adopted which have been published in the press.<br>
<br>
On Monday a number of fishermen began to work upon their traps and on Tuesday morning a large number were at work and it was evident that at least a large majority of the local trap fishermen would go to work without further delay.<br>
<br>
The Illwaco merchants and citizens generally are firmly convinced that only the presence of troops prevents the destruction of the traps in Baker's Bay, and I am of the opinion that there is good ground for this feeling.<br>
<br>
By noon of Tuesday, 14 April, Captain Adams of D Company, First Regiment, had established a very efficient patrol of the entire bay.<br>
<br>
I left Illwaco at 4 o'clock P.M., Tuesday, 14 April 1896, arriving at Seattle at 8:15 A.M., today.<br>
<br>
I expect to receive tomorrow or the next day a detailed report from Captain Adams of the manner in which he has established his patrol, which report will be at once forwarded to general headquarters.<br>
<br>
During all my stay in Illwaco the weather was very stormy and rain fell almost constantly.  The behavior of the detachment on the journey and after getting into camp has been commendable in the highest degree.<br>
<br>
E.M. CARR, BRIG. GEN., COMDG, N.G.W.<br>
<br>
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br>
The following are extracts from the report of Captain Frank E. Adams, commanding the detachment of two other officers and forty enlisted men of Company D:<br>
<br>
The arrival of the detachment found a division among the trap men on the price of fish, and the gill netters determined to hold out for five cents a pound; thus when expected that all on the Washington shore would be peaceful, a strong feeling against the troops was apparent, owing to a misunderstanding as to the reason for the presence of the troops, some ignorant ones insisting that they were employed by the cannery combine, for 50 per day, to force the fishing at four cents per pound.<br>
<br>
In contemplation of internal, as well as external violence, it became immediately necessary to establish efficient patrols on land and water, for the protection of those desiring to proceed with pile driving and setting of trap nets; a call was made upon the sheriff for patrol boats, and the steamer Sea Foam was placed at the disposal of the commanding officer, who in the meantime had prepared a map of the entire situation, upon which appeared range dolphins, which marked the channel lines in Baker's Bay, proving very convenient in designating positions of boats and reporting locations as each dolphin consisted of a pile bearing a cross board with the letters "U.S." and a number.<br>
<br>
A complete circuit was then taken of the entire field, and a plan of operations formulated, resulting in the establishment of an outpost at the east end of Sand Island, consisting of a boat house, designated on the map as Fort Finstopper; at the same time a detail was dispatched to Chinook, the headquarters of the striking trap men, where a camp was established, afterwards known as Paradise.<br>
<br>
From this point a telephone line followed the beach for about eight miles to Illwaco, and instant communication was obtainable between camps.  After a thorough overhauling of the line by Dr. Parks, the owner, and Lieutenant Bryan, commissary of the department, a code was prepared permitting of communications without divulging the contents of the message to those unfamiliar with the key.<br>
<br>
To effectively cover the eight miles of rough shore line intervening between Illwaco and Chinook, or Camp Paradise, a mounted patrol was established consisting of two night patrols, meeting at a point midway the camps and returning, each to their respective stations; during the day, this shore and the movements of the numerous inhabitants scattered along the beach, were discernable from the day patrol boat, Camp Paradise and Fort Finstopper, the latter being so named by reason of its being the point from which the first shot was fired upon a passing sail boat, to emphasize and enforce the order of "come ashore."<br>
<br>
It was apparent that every movement of the troops was closely watched and reported by agents of the fishermen's union of Astoria to that organization, which consisted of between two and three thousand men, comprising all nationalities, the majority being<br>
either Russian, Finns or Italians; this union apparently controlled the actions of these men through the officers, who seemed to take a great interest in the approaching political contest to be held in June for the election of county officials, and it seemed their desire to maintain a feeling of animosity for the purpose of keeping the fishermen upon shore until after election, and later developments indicated the truth of this belief.<br>
<br>
Investigation as to a possible resumption of trap driving upon the disputed territory heretofore mentioned indicated renewed operations upon the settlement of the weather, and in consequence the question arose as to the ownership of Sand Island and a request was made of the commanding officer at Fort Canby for permission to patrol the island, and upon consent thereof a plan for erection of a small fortification commanding the locations in question was adopted and a detail transferred to erect a breastwork thereafter known as Fort Starvation, made necessary by reason of rough and shallow water which prohibited the establishment of water patrols and thereby avoiding unnecessary details of men, which was an essential point all through the campaign by reason of the limited force operating over such a large expanse of territory.<br>
<br>
Sand Island consists of a barren strip of land some four miles long, formed in the shape by the current of the river and tides and covered with driftwood and logs; consequently, upon the establishment of Fort Finstopper at the other end and Starvation at the point of the "L", it became necessary to provide means of communication for transmittal of messages, and a patrol to maintain diligent watch along the outer shore, to avoid the possibility of a large force landing between the stations during the night; to accomplish these ends two horses were transported to the island and a camp established at the lower end, and signal apparatus communicating with the outer end of the long dock, leading from headquarters three-quarters of a mile into Baker's Bay, and such signals as were received by the operator at the end of the dock reached headquarters by means of a bicycle courier or telephone to the telegraph office, where an operator was detailed to communicate with a detail established at Cape Disappointment light house, from which point a commanding view of Astoria, 15 miles distant, and the intervening waters was obtainable and from which point a telegraph line connected with Illwaco.*****<br>
<br>
To complete the circuit, a wire from Chinook telephone line was run to the telegraph office and the operator was in direct communication, with the end of the long wharf, Camp Paradise and Cape Disappointment Light, or Camp Searchlight, as it is called.<br>
<br>
Up to this time (15 April) the patrol by boat was rendered vary uncertain by the reason of impossibility to make proper arrangements for service by the boats, which consisted of the steamer Sea Foam and gasoline launches Iris, Ida Hazel and Hattie Hawthorn, which were at the disposal of Sheriff Roney, when not engaged otherwise; it seemed impracticable to endeavor to maintain control of the situation with such uncertain boat service, and<br>
though every effort had been made to charter two steamers, the result had been fruitless up to this time, and it was determined to withdraw all outposts, as developments indicated a desire on the part of the more passionate of the strikers, at Astoria, to visit Sand Island and annihilate the "hoodlums and bloodthirsty villains", as troops were repeatedly termed in the Oregon papers, after it had become necessary to enforce the orders issued, by the use of the rifle.  The orders up to this time had been to stop all sail boats going in or out of Baker's Bay, ascertain the names of the occupants, number of the boat and destination, and on Sand Island to hold all landing for inspection by the sheriff.<br>
<br>
These orders kept the outposts busy, and the scarcity of boats for patrol caused worry, by the inability to respond to signals from the island; at this time however the steamer "Wenona" came into the bay, subject to the orders of the Sheriff and served as flagship during the entire service.<br>
<br>

<br>
Subsequent communications between the commander of the fort and the commander of the department of the Columbia upon the subject of control resulted in the withdrawal of the national guard and the establishment of a detail of regulars, composing one lieutenant and eighteen men.  This relieved the command of a very disagreeable portion of the work.  It is needless to remark that this change was effected without any of the exciting and warlike proceedings so elaborately portrayed in the daily newspapers*****<br>
<br>
*       *       *       *       *       *       *       *<br>
<br>
About the first report received regarding the fishermen's union was a description of their schooner rigged boat, Pathfinder, which was reported as steel plate lined, with loopholes in the bulwarks, and provided with steam boiler for drawing piles.  This boat had been used several times in committing depredations along the river, and in consequence the excitement was intense among the citizens of Illwaco, on Sunday, 19 April, when this famous boat was sighted approaching Sand Island**.  However, the Pathfinder remained outside the limits established by the detachment patrols and appeared searching or dragging for something on the bottom of the river, but information received later indicated an intent on the part of the strikers from Oregon to draw troops on to commit some act of violence, which was happily averted by their remaining where they belonged, outside the limits of the patrols.  Nevertheless, the day was one of excitement.<br>
<br>
*       *       *       *       *       *       *       *<br>
<br>
Owing to the withdrawal of all outposts, and the consequent increase duty of patrols, it became apparent that the service was too constant for the number of men comprising the detachment, and to maintain the efficiency it became necessary to devise means for keeping a lookout from some promontory readily accessible from<br>
headquarters, and after a careful investigation Cannery hill was chosen as a location for this post by reason of its close proximity, accessibility and the commanding view therefrom.  The camp was established on 28 April and was continued through the entire service.<br>
<br>
*       *       *       *       *       *       *       *<br>
<br>
Trap nets were now dotting the bay, requiring increasing vigilance to cover the expanding territory, and owing to reports received as to the intended action of the strikers, it was deemed advisable to re-establish the camp at Paradise and also at Finstopper.  These were continued until the trapmen, desiring to fish from Chinook, had set their nets, and were able to watch them by day; and seining crews established on Sand Island maintained a watch from that point.  At this time the outposts were again withdrawn and the work of guarding the nets at night and the pile drivers during their operations, was the sole work of the detachment.<br>
<br>
*       *       *       *       *       *       *       *<br>
<br>
The starting of the cannery and catching of fish, resulted in uneasiness on the part of the strikers, and open threats were made to burn the cannery, and on 8 May the Pathfinder was employed, by the strikers, to draw some trap piles on Desdemona<br>
Sands, on the Oregon side; the proceeding was carefully watched from Camp Bay View, and every preparation made to receive the gentlemen did they relish the lawlessness to such an extent that a trial at the obnoxious Washington traps would be the result but their appetite seemed to be satisfied after spoiling one man's living for the season, and they towed their formidable craft back to the harbor in Young's River, close to Astoria.<br>
<br>
As a result, Captain Adams wired Adjutant General Boutelle to forward a howitzer for use in case a similar action was attempted on the Washington side.  The gun arrived on 7 May.<br>
<br>
Fish were now running and were being caught and canned at Illwaco and an attempt was made to start a cannery in Oregon some distance above Astoria; this caused a demonstration on the part of the striking fishermen on 13 May, resulting in an exchange of shots and the destruction of some fish, and it was reported that several men had been wounded; this was the first of a long series of lawlessness on the part of the strikers, resulting in the loss of a great many lives on both sides.<br>
<br>
*       *       *       *       *       *       *       *<br>
<br>
Depredations were now being committed almost every night along the river, though outside the jurisdiction of the detachment, and not knowing what time the strikers might attempt to stop fishing in Baker's Bay it was considered judicious to barricade the patrol boats, and the requisite number of railroad ties were loaned by the Illwaco Railroad and Navigation Company for the purpose, and as it
was now necessary to do considerable patrolling in small sail and row boats, where the rifle was as best a very clumsy weapon to handle, a requisition was made upon general headquarters for revolvers, and upon their arrival each man was furnished therewith.<br>
<br>
Without attempting a detailed report regarding the loss of life and destruction of property upon the river, outside the patrol limits of the detachment, it might be advisable to mention that eight people were murdered in rapid succession while endeavoring to pursue their lawful vocation of fishing; and some of those committing these acts of violence undoubtedly met with just deserts; it was estimated that at least twenty persons met their death as a direct outcome of the agitation.<br>
<br>
*       *       *       *       *       *       *       *<br>
<br>
On the Oregon side matters were assuming a serious aspect, resulting in a call for troops, and the establishment of a full regiment of infantry and one light battery, manning two 12-
pounders, and two gatling guns, at Astoria, on the 16th of June; these troops, scattered over the river on the Oregon side, permitted a slight relaxation of the diligent duty heretofore performed by the National Guard of Washington, and resulted in partial rest for a few days, though the night patrols were still maintained, and a watch kept from Camp Bay View.<br>
<br>
After the arrival of the Oregon Guard, some of the Oregon fishermen who desired to fish, were afforded protection, and fished in the main channel, and the canneries at Astoria were started, though those up the river at Megler's, Cook's and other points had been running for some time though operating under difficulties by reason of the attitude of the strikers; while in Baker's Bay and McGowan's, just outside the bay, the canneries were running full time and had experienced no difficulty whatever, and fish caught in Baker's Bay had been shipped to the canneries at Astoria.<br>
<br>
On Saturday, 21 June, a meeting of the Union fishermen was held at Astoria, and a secret ballot taken, which terminated the great strike, but did not eradicate the bitter feeling against the traps of Baker's Bay which the gill netters were determined to destroy.<br>
<br>
On this day a visit to the Oregon Guard resulted in an exchange of ideas and information, which indicated trouble for the Washington traps, and on the night of the 22nd the patrol boat ran across a sail boat among the traps, but the weather was very rough and the wind strong, and though shots were fired, the patrol was unable to overhaul or capture the boat."<br>
<br>
On the 26th of June, 1896, Captain Adams received instructions from Adjutant General Boutelle to relieve one officer and nineteen enlisted men and return them to Seattle via Kalama.  Upon receipt of the order, Lieutenant Skinner and his detachment left on the steamer <B>Wenona</B> for Kalama at 5 P.M. that day, arriving in Seattle the following day at the same time.In the meantime the balance of the detachment continued to maintain patrols until the 1st day of July, when instructions were received that the Commander-in-Chief desired the relief of the detachment and the immediate return to Seattle.<br>
<br>
With reference to the departure of Captain Adams and the remainder of his detachment, the following was published in the Pacific Journal on Friday, 3 July 1896 at Illwaco:                                                                                      MILITIA GONE<br>
<br>
Last Saturday a telegram was received by Captain Adams of the militia company here to send home twenty of the militia boys; accordingly, for a short time things were lively around camp, and in a couple of hours twenty of the boys were on the Wenona and steaming up the river for Kalama, where they took the train for Seattle.  It was supposed that the balance of the boys would remain here until the fishing season closed, but a dispatch was received Wednesday evening recalling them all.  Without recognizing the fact that the boys were only fulfilling their sworn duty, and with them coming here was not a matter of choice, they have been grossly insulted by some of the Oregon press, which called them "curs" and "cowards", besides the opprobrious epithet of:  "tin soldiers."<br>
<br>
If any of their "dago" pets, however, had undertaken any of their dirty work, they would have found that the boys were a long way from being cowards, and it was only their presence here that has saved us thousands of dollars of property, and should their presence again be necessary they will return as quickly as they come in the first place.<br>
<br>
As for the boys themselves, they are, without exception, a fine body of men, of which the state may be proud.<br>
<br>
Every one was sent to the front in the great railway strike a couple of years ago and proved their mettle and that they were to be depended on in a tight place.<br>
<br>
The first few weeks following their arrival the weather was most disagreeable  raining every day, but not a murmur escaped the lips of a single man.  The duty they performed on Sand Island until relieved by the regulars was no picnic, and they leave here carrying with them an increased respect for the National Guard of Washington by every citizen of Illwaco, who fully recognized the fact that by their presence they have been permitted to exercise the liberty granted them by the Constitution of the United States, which was threatened by a horde of foreigners from another state.<br>
<br>
Appreciating the call for their services, the citizens of the town, before the militia left, presented the company with a large sized photograph of Illwaco and Baker's Bay, showing the scenes of their Labors.  Mayor Howerton made the presentation speech in a few well chosen words, which were responded to by Captain Adams, who accepted the souvenir on behalf of the company, and which will hereafter be kept in the armory at Seattle.<br>
Rev. Atkins and others made a few remarks, and the boys were dismissed by giving three cheers and a "tyee" for Ilwaco, and the citizens echoing in like manner for the boys present and the National Guard of the State of Washington in general."<br>

SASQUATCH.<br>
<br>
James Halpin, "The Sasquatch," <B>Seattle Magazine.</B> p. 31-34, 58-59.<br>
<br>
To     hear some of the unlikely stories, the whole business sounds like a collection of tall tales, legends or just plain superstition: A shaggy humanoid roams the alpine heights of British Columbia, the coastal wilderness of Washington and even the lonesome reaches of California's Sierras.  For over a century, however, these stories of Sasquatch, Biofoot or the Abominable Snowman, as the creature has been variously called, have continued to flourish, and wherever such an elusive and romantic quarry abides, there, too, will be modern-day Jasons in hot pursuit-dogged adventurers who are bent on capturing the prize.<br>
<br>
Rene Dahinden is such a man.  A native born Swiss, Dahinden has spent the last 14 years in quest of the Sasquatch.  Recently he came to Seattle to drum up financial backing for a safari to take scientists and marksmen, armed with tranquilizer guns, through the mountain wilds of the West Coast, wherever the Sasquatch has been reported.<br>
<br>
A dour, compact man with the corded muscles of a mountaineer, Dahinden failed to raise the money.  One reason is that the most he has to show for his own years of searching is a briefcase full of newspaper clippings and some intriguing photographs, plus the plaster cast of a gargantuan footprint.  His lack of evidence does not dismay him, however, and as he talked to SEATTLE, fresh conviction came to his voice, for this past summer had brought him, once again, within tantalizing reach of his quarry.<br>
<br>
"I have yet to see a Sasquatch," Dahinden admits, "and I haven't even come across the tracks of one on any of my own expeditions.  But I've talked to too many people who have seen the beast.  I may be stupid, but I don't think I'm so stupid that I been letting my<br>
leg get pulled for 14 years."<br>
<br>
The list of the dozens of people who claim to have seen a Sasquatch is indeed impressive, and includes doctors and scientists, as well as a Portland newspaper editor.  Although many of these sightings have been reported in the last decade or so, the legend of the Sasquatch actually predates the arrival here of the white man.  
Indians from Alaska to California claimed to have had many encounters with the humanoid, and it was they who christened him Sasquatch-a name that means "wild man of the mountain." There are several reports of Indian maidens being kidnapped by Sasquatches, and there were recognized Sasquatch hunting grounds to which the Indians gave wide berth.<br>
<br>
The earliest report by a white man was recorded in 1846 when A. C. Anderson, a Hudson's Bay Company employee, referred in official correspondence to "the wild giants of the mountains." The most 
detailed <B>of</B> these references appeared in 1884 when <B>a</B> writer for the Daily British Colonist flatly stated that a gorilla-like creature, about 4 feet, 7 inches high and weighing 127 pounds, had been captured by a train crew in the Fraser Canyon.<br>
<br>

The creature, according to this <B>report, </B>had long, black, <B>strong 
hair </B>and <B>resembles a</B> human being with <B>one exception, his en</B><B>tire 
body </B>is <B>covered with glossy hair about</B> one inch <B>long. . . . He 
possesses extra</B><B>ordinary strength, as he will take hold</B> <B>of a </B>stick 
and break it <B>by wrenching or</B> twisting it, <B>which no man living could</B> 
break <B>in </B>the same way.<br>
<br>

Its keeper, the report went on, was <B>a</B> man named George Telbery, who 
<B>"proposes</B> shortly starting <B>for </B>London, England, <B>to</B> exhibit him"-and 
that was the last <B>word</B> on "Jacko," as the beast was dubbed.<br>
<br>
Not all reports are quite so convincing.  Some 40 years later, Albert Ostman, a recluse presently living in British Columbia, claimed that he was abducted by Sasquatches and held captive for 
six days <B>above</B> Toba Inlet near Lund, B.C. Ostman said he was not mistreated by either the Sasquatch couple or their two children, and that they even fed him some of the roots they gathered.  In return he gave the Sasquatch father some snuff -which made the creature so sick that Ostman was able to escape.<br>
<br>

One of the eeriest encounters with <B>a </B>Sasquatch may have taken place in 1950.  One warm Sunday on Mt.  St. Helens, a well known Seattle mountaineer named Jim Carter disappeared in an area where so many Sasquatch sightings have occurred that it has been named Ape 
Canyon.  Carter's <B>ski</B> tracks indicated he had careened down the mountain, taking chances, as one searcher said, "that no skier of his caliber would take, unless something was terribly wrong or he would take unless something was terribly wrong or he was being pursued."<br>
<br>
In his wild descent Carter jumped several yawning crevices before going right off a steep canyon wall.  Neither he nor his equipment were ever found, and several members of the search party reported they had a weird feeling of being watched all the time they were there.<br>
     

Among the searchers was Bob Lee, <B>a</B> mountaineer who subsequently led a 1961 climbing expedition into the Himalayas.  Reminiscing about Carter's disappearance, Lee admitted that both he and Dr. Otto Trott, the surgeon for Seattle's Mountain Rescue Council, came to the same conclusion: "The apes got him."<br>
<br>
An even more recent report of an actual sighting comes from William Roe of Edmonton, Alberta.  He made a notorized oath claiming that, in 1955, he was hunting near Tete Juane Cache, B.C., when he 
stumbled upon a 300-pound female anthropoid eating leaves from <B>a 
</B>tree only 20 feet away.  Roe described it as having a broad frame, straight from hips to should@r, with arms reaching almost to the 
knees.  It was covered with brown, silver-tipped <B>fur </B>and had 
breasts.  When it walked, he could see grey-brown skin <B>or </B>hide on 
the soles <B>of </B>its feet.  Its ears were human, but it had almost no neck.<br>
<br>
"Finally the thing must have gotten my scent," stated Roe.  "Still 
in <B>a </B>crouched position, it backed up three or four short steps ... 
and started to walk rapidly <B>away,</B> again turning its head in my 
direction.  <B>I</B> lowered the rifle.  I felt now that it was <B>a</B> human being, and I knew I would never forgive myself if I killed it."<br>
<br>
Dahinden finds nothing remarkable about the Sasquatch's success in evading capture.  He points out not only that there are more than 160,000 square miles of wilderness in the Northwest for these creatures to hide in, but that man is a long way from having identified all the creatures on the planet.<br>
<br>
He  cites, for instance, the research of Ivan T.  Sanderson, an explorer-scientist-author, .who for many years has been collecting all sorts of man-ape reports.  The conclusion 'reached by Sanderson is that yet-to-be discovered animals include at least a half-<br>
<br>
nents.  He maintains these animals are well known to the natives of the regions they inhabit; in Mongolia, for example, there is even one variety which is said to engage in primitive trading with nomadic herdsmen.<br>
<br>
As for the so-called Abominable Snowmen of the Himalayas, Sanderson stresses that natives, responsible scientists and explorers have sighted them.  For example, A. N. Tombazie, fellow of the Royal Geographical Society of London, reported watching through field glasses in Sikkim as such a creature dug for roots, and, making his way to the spot, Tombazie found its footprints.<br>
<br>
Humanoid sightings have been taken seriously as far afield as the Soviet Union, where two scientists, A. J. Pronin of Leningrad University, and Professor V. K. Lentieve, chief of the Conservation Department of the Dagestan Republic, claim to have seen Snowmen. 
Lentieve, in a 40-page monograph, states that from a distance of only 50 paces he saw one that was seven feet tall, clothed in shaggy hair, and walking on widetoed feet.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, claims Lentieve, when he fired a shot at its feet, the creature raced off up a steep slope with unbelievable speed.  On the basis of this and other reports, the Soviet Academy of Sciences has appointed a special investigative commission.<br>
<br>
But by far the most famous Snowman incident occurred in 1951, when Eric Shipton, a world-renowned mountaineer, came across a set of tracks while on a Himalayan expedition with Edmund Hillary, the 
conquerer of Mount Everest.  Photographs <B>of</B> these clear tracks started a world-wide controversy and led to a number of subsequent Snowman expeditions.<br>
<br>
Dahinden's own obsession with Sasquatches is closely tied in with these Snowman reports.  Indeed, the start of his quest dates from 
the day, back in 1953, when he read <B>a</B> newspaper article about a group searching for this species in the Himalayas.  "I was working for a farmer in Calgary at the time," recalls Dahinden, "and I mentioned to him that I'd sure like to go on an expedition like that. He told me I didn't have to go to the Himalayas to look for Snowmen, because there were supposed to be lots of them right in British Columbia."<br>
<br>
A glint comes into Dahinden's eyes as he goes on: "Something clicked inside me then, and, looking back, it seemed that maybe I'd been searching all my life for a chance like that-a chance to really accomplish something."<br>
<br>
Dahinden's search for a cause-any cause -had been a long and troubled one.  Born illegitimately, he was placed in a Swiss or-
phanage and remained there until his adoption by an elderly Swiss stationery wholesaler and his wife.  The foster mother died a few years later, and soon the widower remarried.  His new wife took an instant dislike to Dahinden who, when he was 11, was sent to boarding school for a year and then placed in the care of a farming family.<br>
<br>
"Life was hard on the farm," says Dahinden without bitterness.  "There was absolutely no time allowed for play.  As soon as I got home from school, I had to start the chores, and I worked at them untit bedtime.  It wasn't that these people were cruel.  They just had no time for affection."<br>
<br>
Dahinden left the farm when he was 15 and started wandering through Europe.  "I know now," he says, "that I was looking for a big enough challenge to spend my life on." At 23, he decided to
emigrate to Western Canada, and, soon after his arrival, he took a wife.<br>
<br>
Once Dahinden had set his beart on proving the existence of the Sasquatch, neither marriage nor the birth of two sons could keep him off the scent.  Faced with the problem of providing for bis family and still baving time enough to hunt Sasquatches, he came up with an ingenious solution.<br>
<br>
"At the time, my wife Wanja and I were operating a boat rental service at Harrison Hot Springs in B.C.," he explained.  "One day, when I was watching the skeet shooting, I noticed that all the lead pellets were falling in the lake.  I got an option from the hotel to recover the lead, took out ten tons with a dredge, and made a profit of $2,500."<br>
<br>
Since that time, Dahinden has extracted lead from gun-club lakes and ponds all over the U.S. and Canada.  In fact, he might well have made his fortune by now had he devoted all his energy to this curious enterprise.  However, working only enough to meet living expenses, Dahinden devoted much of bis time to trekking in the wilderness for his furtive prey.  His most extended search occurred during the early 1960's when he took part in expeditions which, on and off for two years, fruitlessly combed the Humboldt-Del Norte region of California.<br>
<br>
The jaunts were financed by Tom Slick, an oil multi-millionaire who had collected a large amount of "Biofoot" material, including analyses of the creature's supposed fur and droppings.  The quest took a major setback in 1962 when Slick was killed in an airplane crash, and all his material inexplicably vanish. (Sasquatch buffs theorize it was simply thrown away by Slick's family, which did not approve of his search.)<br>
<br>
Inevitably, Dahinden's long absences from home put a great strain on his marriage.  "One day Wanja just told me I was going to have to stop this Sasquatch thing or else," recalls Dahinden.  "I answered that if it came to choosing between her and the Sasquatch, then she was the one who would have to go.  So we split up.  Of course I miss her and our two sons, but I couldn't knuckle under to an ultimatum like that.  If you're not doing what you like to do, you're a prostitute, not a man, and your kids will realize it."<br>
<br>
Now, with all his time free for his quest, Dahinden is busy fund-raising and keeping in touch with the half-dozen or so other huntsmen in North America who share his monomania.  Taken in sum, the growing weight of evidence is becoming harder and harder to ignore, but even so, Dahinden is subject to almost as much ridicule as before.<br>
     
"Of course the whole thing seems crazy," he admits, speaking in a heavy Swiss accent and puffing methodically on a cigarillo.  "An 800-pound, half-human creature walking around practically in our backyards? But you can't just turn your back on the facts.  Take those tracks I was looking down at last week......<br>
<br>
The tracks in question had been discovered late this summer by Bud Ryerson, a building contractor, in California's Bluff Creek area between Reading and Eureka.  Imbedded in the soft dirt of a logging road, they looked much like the prints of flatfooted human beings - except that some were 15 inches long and seven inches wide.<br>
<br>

In describing his find to <B>SEATTLE, </B>Ryerson spoke over a radio phone from his roadbuilding camp in Bluff Creek.  "I'd seen sixnilar tracks before, but never in this quantity," he said.  "There were more than 1,000 of them, and the different sizes suggested they were made by at least three separate creatures.  Their depth indicated they weighed more than 500 pounds.  Whatever it was that made them had picked up some of my crates containing tractor parts.  These crates weigh about 50 pounds, and the creatures had carried them several hundred yards into the brush before dropping them."<br>
<br>
Alarmed because his equipment had been disturbed, Ryerson called in a sheriff's deputy who found large fingerprints on the cases, but, unfortunately, the prints proved too smudged to be conclusive.  Meanwhile, Ryerson had also called John Green, the publisher of a British Columbia newspaper called the Agassiz-Harrison Advance, who is one of the continent's foremost believers in Sasquatches.  Green, in turn, informed Dahinden, who talked the Vancouver Sun 
into chartering <B>a </B>small plane to take both men to Bluff Creek.<br>
<br>
Arriving the day after the tracks were discovered, Dahinden took one look at them and telephoned the Provincial Museum in Victoria.  Convinced that the tracks were no simple hoax, the museum authorities promptly dispatched Donald C. Abbott, the Provincial anthropologist, to study them scientifically.<br>
<br>
Abbott frankly concedes that what he saw when he got there shook him.  "I was laughing at the whole idea all the way down," he remarks.  "Now I don't think it's a subject for mirth anymore.  You realize that a scientist could ruin his reputation by going out on a limb and saying the creatures exist.  So I won't say I believe in them, but I am genuinely puzzled."<br>
<br>
One of the most perplexing aspects of the prints was their clear indication that whatever made them had a five-foot stride.  Taking all possibilities into account, the Sasquatch hunters briefly wondered whether a practical joker on stilts might have been responsible, but a stiltwalker, they conluded, would have had to
carry about a quarter-ton of weight to have made such impressions.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, the tracks went up high grounds that a stiltwalker could never have negotiated.  "Those prints," says Abbott, "were not made by any known animals.  That leaves only two possibilities.  Either someone is pulling one of the most complicated stunts ever, or the prints were made by a large bipedal primate that has never been described before.  Both alternatives are close to being impossible."<br>
<br>
Abbott's report to his superiors led to a change of heart that Dahinden has been trying to achieve for a decade.  At last the Provincial Government officials admitted to he possibility that the Sasquatches really exist.  Shortly after the Bluff Creek finding, he recreation minister of British Columbia, Kenneth Kiernan, went further, and announced that the Provincial Museum was seeking all tangible Sasquatch evidence.<br>
<br>
But despite their apparent open-mindedess, Provincial officials believe the evidence far is insufficient to warrant launching a full-scale Sasquatch hunt.  This attitude infuriates Dahinden.  "There are at least 300 people who have reported seeing either Sas-
aatcbes or their tracks," he says angrily, is voice rising and his eyes flashing.<br>
<br>

"What <B>in the  </B>hell more do they need? I suppose they will never really believe until someone brings them back a dead one."<br>
<br>
Then Dahinden pauses and his mood turns pensive.  "You know," he says quietly, in spite of all I've been through looking for the bloody things.  I wonder if I could shoot them. When I finally come face to face with Sasquatch, as I know one day I shall, perhaps I'll figure to hell with what the world thinks.  I'll have proved to myself that was right, and I may just turn around and walk away."<br>

Kicked around for 50,000 years, mocked, driven into exile and pursued by eager bounty hunters how much more can the Sasquatch endure?
Most Sasquatch stories end with a wild-eyed camper who runs screaming into town, but my own favorite is the one about a self-possessed man in Oroville, California.  He recently spotted one of the gigantic, hairy ape-men (called Bigfoot in that state) sittingjust across the slough in the man's back yard.  The monster was holding his head in his hands, as if downcast over something.  After watching the creature for a moment, the man went inside to catch the news on television.<br>
<br>
It is heartening to see the Sasquatch, who now shows up along the West Coast about 100 times a year, becoming so commonplace he cannot compete with the evening news.  And I was happy to see the Calffornian comport himself with all the aplomb of the husband in James Thumber's parable, "The Unicorn in the Garden." In Thumber's story, which recounts one of those small, satisfying victories of imagination over empiricism, the man notices duing breakfast one particularly fine morning that there is "a white unicorn with a gold horn quietly cropping the roses in the garden."<br>
<br>
When confronted with this story, the man's wife eyes him coldly, then summons a policeman and a psychiatrist.  After she de@bes the unicorn carefully, the two men cart her away to the booby hatch; the man lives happily ever after.<br>
<br>
Not so happy is the Sasquatch.  Indeed, I imagine that the creature sighted in Oroville was most likely sunk in melancholy reflection over the coming demise of his race.  And when he dies, the last great monster of the civilized world dies, too.<br>
<br>
Of course, doom has always surrounded the Sasquatch during the hundred orso years of his recorded life, much like the thick fog of the coastal mountains in which he hides.  To some of the Indians in British Columbia, the Sasquatch are the last of a race of giant# who have nearly exterminated themselves in warfare.  To a Mercer Island doctor who became one of the several Sasquatch scholars in this area, they are the pathetic, last descendants of the Neanderthalers, a race rudely pushed aside during the last Ice Age by Cro-Magnon man (who has always felt guilty about the whole affair).<br>
<br>
I'm beginning to wonder how much longer the shaggy Sasquatch can hold out, pursued as he is from Nonhem Califomia to Alaska.  Not content to leave our hoariest myth well enough alone, the hunters have lately pulled o'ut all the stops in their attempts to bring a Sasquatch back-dead or alive.  An Oregon man, convinccd that the
Sasquatch are superior beings who confound scientific detection methods, is trying to convince them of his sincerity by using only meditation, love and ESP.<br>
<br>
Near Hoquiam, a Seattle man is spending his weekends in a Sasquatch patch; his method is to remain unperturbed when a beast is crashing around in the woods nearby, thus building trust.  Among standard wc*aponry are mace, grenade launchers and tranquilizing guns, along with such lures as salt pork, electronic noise-makers, and even used sanitary napkins.<br>
<br>
A laudable humanitarian concem has grown up of late, in particular in Skamania County, where Sasquatch killing has now been made punishable by five years' imprisonment.  Numerous hunters have balked before pu@g the trigger, unnerved by the human expression and darting, terrified eyes of the giant. (More poetic woodsmen explain that any other Sasquatch within whistling distance would descend on a hunter who bags a solitary one.)<br>
<br>
But I haven't noticed any society for the preservation of myths taking its stand.<br>
<br>
The agency most likely to transform this richly embroidered tale into cold fact is a Seattle orgam'zation recandy formed by a 51-year-old investment developer named Gil Chandler.  An organizer and past president of the Seattle Zoological Society, Chandler, I'm sorry to report, is finally going to the heart of the matter in the right way.  Almost all the expeditions now in the field are made up of people convinced the Sasquatch exists and eager to cash in on their findings.  The result is that practically nobody, especially the scientists, takes them very scriouslyfihns, footprints, hair, and droppings to the contrary notwithstanding.<br>
<br>
Chandler's non-profit organization is delving into the matter with considerable skepticism.  Although its members will feed into a computer the data regarding all sightings back to 1909, Chandler expects the number of "strong" sightings to be only about 30.  "I will be almost as happy to prove the Sasquatch doesn't exist as to fmd one," he says.<br>
<br>
If Chandler, who is a whiz at fund-raising, is able to enlist museum backing and a budget he puts at "more than $100,000," his team will head for a computer-selected site in Canada sometime next month-to start a year's search effort.  This approach should produce the first truly rigorous inspection of evidence so far.<br>
<br>
One piece of evidence that has already been carefully inspected is the film purportedly taken in October, 1967, of a female Bigfoot in
northern Califomia. Like most of the experts who have studied it, Chandler is willing to rule out trick photography, "but not a mas-
querade."<br>
<br>
Most other experts admit, however, that if the creature shown is indeed a man in a monkey suit, the hoax is quite a skillful job.  It would have been easy to know what features the creature should have, since the Sasquatch has been so well publicized, but it would have been hard to make its long arms, heavy buttocks, blunt neck, long, loping stride on massive, human-like feet, and above all, its great bulk, all seem so authentic.<br>
<br>
In other words, the masquerade would have been rather expensive, and the photographer, Roger Patterson of Yakima, was downand-out at the time, after years of two-bit promoting.  Shortly after the film was first shown, Patterson, a former rodeo rider who is now 37 years old, was even tossed into jail for failure to return or pay for a camera he rented to film Sasquatch. (The camera was immediately returned.)<br>
<br>
To be sure, the irrefutable evidence, such as bones or fossils, has never materialized-a glaring omission for a creature that has supposedly been around for millions of years.  About the only such evidence we have to go on is some bones found in China and India which are thought to be those of a suitably large ape (now assumed to be extinct), called the gigantopithecus.<br>
<br>
According to one hypothesis, this ape migrated to North America, eschewed trees and developed a human foot (but without developing other human features, a most unlikely pattem), and then laid low for eons.  "You could count on one hand the number of scientists who believe this happened," says Dr. Darius Swindler of the U.W. Regional Primate Research Center, one of the open-minded anthropologists who has interviewed people who claim to have sighted a Sasquatch.  According to Dr. Swindler, the altemative explanation of a primitive man who grew very large and shy around 30,000 years ago when the diminutive Neanderthal man bowed out, is even less likely.<br>
<br>
Faced with these odds, it is little wonder that some believers claim that the Sasquatch arrived from outer space.  "I am getting reports now from a lot of other places in the country, particularly from the South," reports Roger Patterson, whose mail runs to 200 letters a day.  "Sometimes," he adds, "the sightings are said to coincide with landings of flying saucers." (The possibility that Sasquatch are being exported from the Northwest via flying saucer has a nice irony to it, since the saucer craze started when nine UFO's were spotted over Mt.  Rainier in 1947.)<br>

The explanation I prefer, however, is inner space-mixed up with a few hoaxes like the "ape-attack" in 1924 (now pretty well deflated) that supposedly drove five prospectors from Ape Canyon, on the east slope of Mount St. Helens. (Grisly tales about that area have circulated for years, owing to the lost gold mine supposed to be located there; the Greeks knew the same ruse, and they invented the griffin-the lion-cagle-to guard their mincs.) The West's mythic imagination, now deprived of its tradition of tall tales, has seized upon the Sasquatch and fattened him up well.<br>
<br>
Most of the stories involve only brief encounters, such as the recent one near Copalis, Washington, in which three teenage girls were out driving at night when one of them spotted a Sasquatch jumping up and down in a ditch.  Sometimes, touches of character emerge.<br>
<br>
One Sasquatch was glimpsed wearing tattered old clothes.  Another, speaking an Indian dialect, rebuked a man who had clubbed a 12-foot Sasquatch who lived in a tree.  Others, in a role very engaging to modem environmentalists, pitch road-building equipment around or overturn camper trucks.<br>
<br>
Out of these brief encounters, however, mythmakers of various sorts have managed to construct elaborate stories, creating a range encompassing the various ages of man.  The Indian stories focus on children.  Sasquatch believers claim that the old Indian tales prove that the giants have been well-known for centuries, but a U.  W. anthropologist, Melville Jacobs, inclines to the view that "the Sasquatch is entirely a white man's myth, deriving from the European's greater anxiety about father figures."<br>
<br>
Similarly, George Quimby, curator of the Burke Museum, suspects the Sasquatch could be traced to loggers' tales and pranks.  Nevertheless, the Indian stories have certainly kept things alive.<br>
Don Smith, an Indian from Ariel, Washington, who is a close student of the tales as well as a carver and singer, says the oldest story pattem concerns a cannibal woman who likes to roast children.<br>
<br>
She is called Tsunoqua (DZU-na-kwa) by the Kwakiutl people of northem Vancouver Island, who, together with the more northem Tlingits, seem to have developed the most elaborate stories.  The majority of these are variations on a single theme: the giant kidnaps some children (on occasion by disguising herself as their grandmother), seals up their eyes with red chewing gum, tosses them in a basket which she carries on her back (where Sasquatch have a big hump of fat for winter hibemation), and heads for her cabin in the woods.<br>
<br>
The Tsunoqua people, according to the late George Boas, the
distinguished Columbia University anthropologist, are black, twice the size of man, possessed of very deep-set eyes and loud voices, and are inland dwellers.  All these traits correspond to those of the Sasquatch (a Chehalis word meaning "hairy giants").  Their characteristic noise is "u, u, u, u,"-hence they are usually carved with puckered lips.  At night, they imitate bird noises by means of a chain of whistles worn round their necks.<br>
<br>
In the stories of other tribes, the giants are often merely renegades who have gone wild-"Stick Indians." But the Tsunoqua is more supernatural, a kind of earth-god matched against the heroic sky gods, like the Thunderbird, who sometimes turns Tsunoqua into giant stones.  They cannot be killed-the name derives from a word meaning "to be alive"-because their source of life is hidden in a secret spot in the woods or sometimes in one ankle.<br>
<br>
(Perhaps this explains why the three dozen hunters who have shot at Sasquatch have all failed to bring one back.) Nevertheless, says Don Smith, Tsunoqua is "a terrible dum-dum who is usually just about falling asleep." (Although a Sasquatch is able to hypnotize his prey, he can himself be put to sleep by circling a pointed finger in his face.) So Tsunoqua is usually thwarted, often by the hitherto despised youth who figures heroically in numerous folk tales of all nations.<br>
<br>
In one Kwakiutl tale, a crippled boy whose warnings went unheeded cuts a hole in the basket, allowing all the captured children to escape.  Tsunoqua then appears at a village feast, where her vanity and her desire for human beauty usually prove her undoing. (In stories of the Abominable Snowman of Asia, mimicry is a common feature.) She wishes to wear carrings like the pretty girls and asks to have her cars pierced-whereupon spikes are driven into her thick skull.<br>
<br>
The body is then invariably shoveled into a large pit-as jack the giant killer did with his first victim-where a fire is started by hot rocks.  A hollow voice sings from the ashes:<br>
I have the magic treasure,<br>
I have the supernatural power,<br>
I can retum to life.<br>
<br>
When the ashes are stirred, they fly up and metamorphose into lesser, but far more bothersome, cannibals-mosquitoes.<br>
Potent and pathetic, attuned to nature and yet a stumblebum around the village, the Tsunoqua, like the Sasquatch, is a marvelous image of shaggy old humanity left behind, the natural way, strong but stumped.<br>
<br>
The lore surrounding the creature is properly ambivalent: to hear the Tsunoqua brings good fortune; to see one is calamitous.<br>
Don Smith does not quite believe in the physical existence of
<br>
Sasquatch; for one thing, he remembers that he once carved a pair of gigantic wooden feet for some practical jokers.  But he suspects the myth goes very deep, if only because so many Indian mothers use the story to get their children inside at bedtime.  A few years ago, he was at Neah Bay, looking at some Sasquatch tracks.<br>
<br>
At dusk, Smithor Lelooshka, to use his Kwakiutl name-watched a father position his young son's feet in the giant prints.  Then the boy put his palms in the track and rubbed them on his chest, "to get the power."<br>
<br>
Among the longer stories told by white men, several recount an atavistic return to the family, where the teller lives again as a well-protected child.  Probably the most detailed Sasquatch adventure on record is that of Albert Ostman, a recluse who went gold-prospecting 100 miles north of Vancouver 45 years ago.  One night, while lying in his sleeping bag, he was picked up by a Sasquatch and transported to the creature's lair in a box canyon.<br>
<br>
Much of Ostman's story details his Crusoe-like concern with mstung up a good cup of coffee in the mornings, but he also pauses to admire the "very practical and warm" blanket which the Sasquatch had made of cedar bark and moss, and to play some games with the two shy children.  The old lady, he recalls, wore bangs and baffly needed a brassiere.  The story ends when Ostman cut short his courtship with the daughter of the family (reasonhig that she would hate city hfe, as he does) and tricked the old man into swallowing an overdose of snuff.<br>
<br>
Then he flew the coop as the father, squealing like a pig, downed a pot of coffee, grounds and afl.<br>
<br>
A similar story comes from Warren Scott, a 37-year-old Seattle man who works as a building superintendent.  It was June of 1961, and Scott, who grew up in a tough ncighborhood in New York City and spent several years bumming around after his release from the Army, was camping alone, 30 miles northeast of Vancouver.  Late at night, a Sasquatch kidnapped him and carried him 70 miles.  During the journey, Scott was almost suffocated by the creature's vice-like grip and uremic odor.  Eventually, he was carried through a long tunnel and dumped in a cave.<br>
<br>
Most of Scott's ordeal was spent in this hot, fire-lit enclosure.  The mother took care of him, bringing him food (greens and inedi%le chunks of raw meat); the old man was seldom around.  "I was treated like a pet," Scott recalls.  He endured some good-natured whacking on the rump; he was watched intently when pass@ wastes, and he engaged in some rock-rolling with the kids.  The noise and the
smell were terrific.  At night, father, mother and son Sasquatch would hold each other tightly, rock for 10 minutes, and then drop off to sleep on bough beds.<br>
<br>
One day, Scott wandered out of the momentarily unguarded cave and was terrillied to sce 50 or 60 Sasquatch wandering about in the canyon.  "The female who fed me came up to me, grabbed me and held me to her bosom until I was calm.  Then she put me down." Soon thereafter, Scott's protector took him, tog@er with her own son, on a tour of the other caves, one of which proved to be a very busy nursery.<br>
<br>
A few days later, Scott located the densely curtained tunnel opening and made his escape.<br>
<br>
These tender tales seem rather chaste m view of the fact that they deal with apes, which have been a symbol for male sexuality at least since the time of the phallic baboons of Egypt.  Thus, I was pleased to discover a collection of robust stories collected by a Fairbanks contractor namcd Fred Clarke.  For 12 years, CIarke, who is 50 and the father of four, has been collecting Sasquatch tales, mostly en route between Alaska and California.<br>
<br>
"You can pick up 100,000 of these stories on such a drive," says Clarke, who seems to find a thriving oral tradition at every remote town.  This June, for instance, when he rushed off to check out the Gray's Harbor County story, an old woman at a service station told him that the local Sasquatch had been breaking pigs' backs for years.<br>
<br>
A second woman topped that story with one about the day her husband, out cutting shakes, got slammed into the mud by a Sassy.<br>
Clarke's Sasquatch are gypsies at heart-one Indian name for them is "Wanderer"-who love to take long walks.  They are guided by nose-radar, which explains why they swing their bodies (they have no necks) when they walk, as well as why people within range of the radar feel a prickling sensation.  Supposedly, there are about two dozen Sasquatch left (othcr estimates go into the thousands), divided into four tribes: the Northern Californians, the Vancouver Islanders, the Tonpssers, and the Tweedsmuir Parkers (in this B.C. park, Clarke once sat alone for three weeks until he finally saw one).<br>
<br>
When they visit one another, the main activity of the men is combing each other's long hair, which falls to the shoulders and is colored either black, brown, camel or off-white.<br>
<br>
Some of Clarke's tales are little episodes of stark terror, the kind that end up with a prospector taking to the bottle, and which recall the old tall tales of mutilated bodies and haunted valleys.
(Sasquatch scholars have dug up one harrowing story told by Teddy Roosevelt in 1893, as well as reported sightings which date back to 1846.  But that's nothing: Grendel was also a Sasquatch, and legions of them once fought for the Persians.)<br>
<br>
Clarke's best stories concern the coming-of-age of the young Sasquatch, an event which takes place at age 50. (This seems about right, since the life expectancy is 200 and breeding takes place only every 100 years.) Armed with an eight-inch penis, the young buck is sent on his first solo excursion.  He normally warms up with an Indian squaw, who might pass a winter's hibernation with him, nestled against his warm breast and soft downy hair, or enjoying his low, ainorous hooting.<br>
<br>
Then it is on to the Yucatan Peninsula, where the gods of fertility forepther in a lovely jungle park laden with huge mushrooms.  Without the mushrooms, the Sasquatch cannot breed; with them, his lovcmaking sets off earthquakes.<br>
<br>
This version of the sexually fulfilled Sasquatch is contradicted by another expert, Richard Beyer, a Seattle sculptor who specializes in rough-hewn carvings of the beast.  Sexual perversion has set in, dead-pans Beyer-witness those dalliances with construction machinery.<br>
<br>
Beyer confines his belief in the Sasquatch to his imagination, where the creature displays a captured and defeated countenance, a bit like that of the downcast fellow in the CaIifomian's back yard.  Beycr's first carving of the creature (a man-sized statue which stands near Neah Bay) was not intended to represent a Sasquatch at all, but merely to, portray animal aggression as a protest against the bombing of North Vietnam.<br>
<br>
Later, someone told Beyer the carving reminded him of a Sasquatch, and eventually the artist camc to agree.  In subsequent carvings, Beyer began to express the pathos of the hunted, lonely outcast.<br>
<br>
"Some animals become alienated from life, "he explains.  "They get disgusted, they clear out, driven to the barren grounds.  Wolves, ravens, and Sasquatch are@ among those that withdrew."<br>
<br>
I once listened to a recording of a simulated Sasquatch cry.  It starts like the gruff laughter of a baboon, rises to a Tarzan wail, and then sinks like a siren back to the coarse grunting.  I heard it at night on Roger Patterson's little farm near a remote creek where white Sasquatch occasionally fish.  The recording had the desired, creepy effect.  But Beyer hears a more clegaic melody:<br>
<br>
"Their music heard in a wild canyon on a quiet evening can be quite
beautiful, though sad."<br>
<br>
The best study I've yet found on the subject of Sasquatch takes an approach similar to Beyer's, defining the Sasquatch as an exiled brother.  The book is an unpublished monograph which, until his death last year, a Mercer Island physician named Howard C. Eddy was preparing for submission to the Carl jung Institute in Zurich.<br>
<br>
The work starts out with a review of the surprisingly abundant evidence for the existence of the Sasquatch, much of it deriving from the remarkable similarity of the descriptions of the beast, and from those pesky footprints.  Even Chief Seattle tums out to have been a believer; he used to claim that Sasquatch hung out on the north end of Bainbridge Island.<br>
<br>
Dr. Eddy also stresses the enormous expansc of virtually unexplored wilderness in this area, pointing out that until 200 years ago, the Northwest was considered the most remote of all the habitable regions of the earth.<br>
<br>
Then Dr. Eddy discusses the possible origins of the Indian myths.  First of all, he says, many of the stories could have been brought here firom northeastern Asia, whose tribes have very similar tales.  Dr. Eddy's own theory, however, postulates the evolution of a gigantic "Glacial Man" who, rather than evolving during the Ice Ages into the more socialized modern man, simply grew big (to produce more body heat) and shaggy, and developed his animal instincts to the highest degree-"one who took a rcgressive biologic road to survival."<br>
<br>
Even if this lost cousin does not exist' writes Dr. Eddy, he has an unshakable place in a universal myth that suggests an ancient parting of the race: the myth of the disadvantaged brother.  Dr. Eddy interprets this myth according to Jun * gian psychology, in which the personality struggles for completeness by incorporating its "shadow" or darker aspects, which wcll up in man's middle age.<br>
<br>
The many stories of the disadvantaged brother, writes Dr. Eddy, simply re-enact this psychological phenomenon.  The dark brother is driven from the house, burdened with one's own devilish attributes and then set wandering (like Ishmael, Isaac's half-brother, or Cain, who like the Sasquatch was marked by God to be unkillable); later he returns to mock the falsely pure ideals of the favored brother.<br>
<br>
The best Biblical parallel is the story of Isaac's twin sons, Jacob, the smooth man of the tents, and Esau, the hairy man of the
forest. In the story, Jacob deceitfully deprives Esau of his inheritance by dressing up in his brother's animal skins.  After a long period of warfare, the two brothers are reconciled.  It is this ancient pattern of guilt, repression, confrontation and struggle which makes the sighting-or even the rumors-of a Sasquatch "very upsetting to the psyche."<br>
<br>
An ominous passage in jung's works may suggest why the myth is so prevalent now.  In all his German patients after World War 1, jung noticed recurrent mythological motifs which were not attributable to individual personality traits.<br>
<br>
These were "in the form of collective mythological symbols which expressed primitivity, violence, cruelty; in short, all the powers of darkness." jung attributed this occurrence to feelings of defeat and social disaster following the war, and added that they lead to a strong desire on the part of the individuals to join with others who have experienced the same thing. just as flying saucers started appearing at a time of anxiety over Russian nuclear attack, so the Sasquatch might reflect anxiety about an assault from within, about an age of mounting unreason.<br>
<br>
The demise of the Sasquatch, then, may not be so certain.  Science has dealt cruel blows to the imagination, but that old crime against our gigantic progenito rs may be harder to extirpate.  The voice from the pit grows louder:<br>
<br>
I have the magic treasure,<br>
1 have the supernatural power,<br>
I can return to life.<br>

There were no schools in the days of which I speak, but there was a spot near the forest, a playground, where children used to play.  One little boy that played there had a knife-what kind I don't know; it happened a long, long time ago.<br>
<br>
The other children wanted to borrow that knife but the boy told them, "My mother and father won't allow me to lend it.  My mother said you might cut yourself with it, then blame me. My father said you might lose it and never return it.  That is what my parents told me."<br>

Well, you know what kids are like.  The children decided they would not play with the little boy with the knife.  "Let him go by himself," they said to one another.  They taunted the boy and teased him.  Their backs were to the forest.<br>
<br>
Suddenly the boy with the knife cried, "Hey! I see a big figure in<br>
the trees!"<br>
<br>
The children did not turn around and look but kept their backs to the forest.  "You're just saying that because we won't play with you," they shouted.<br>
<br>
"No, I'm not," argued the boy.  "There it is again! A big figure.  It's watching us."<br>
<br>
But the children would not listen.  "You're just trying to fool us but it won't work," they chided.  "We're not going to have anything to do with you."<br>
<br>
"It's coming!" screamed the boy.  "It's coming!"<br>
<br>
The children saw it then.  It was a big, big man, bigger than any other.  He had hair all over his body and his eyes were set deep in his face.  He carried a large basket on his back.  The children's strength drained out of them in fear.  They were helpless.<br>
<br>
The woods giant grabbed the boy that had the knife first and threw him in his basket.  Then he threw all the rest of the children on top of him.  He set off through the forest while the children peeked through the cracks of the basket, trying to see where he was taking them.<br>
<br>
The boy with the knife was right at the bottom of the basket and could hardly move with all the children on top of him.  Finally he was able to cut a slit in the basket big enough to squeeze through and he dropped to the ground.  The man did not notice, and the boy ran back to his village crying, "Big Figure has taken all the children!"<br>
<br>
The men of the village gathered together.  They asked the boy to lead the way that Big Figure had gone.  They traveled over roots and under logs.  At the place the boy had fallen through the basket the trail became harder to follow.  They could see where something big had gone through the bush and followed that till eventually the trail ended at a large cave.<br>

The men of the village could dimly see some of their children hanging by the feet in the dark cave.  A huge figure of a man was tying up the other children's feet and putting pitch in their eyes.  His wife and children were helping him.<br>
<br>
"What are you doing with our children?" the villagers cried.<br>
<br>
"We're going to smoke them," answered the giant.<br>
<br>
"Those are our children! We want to take them home with us, said the villagers.<br>
<br>
"We're going to smoke them and eat them," replied the big man.  He and his wife finished tying the children's feet and started hanging them up, one by one, with the other children.<br>
<br>
"Don't do that, the fathers of the children pleaded.  "Let us take them home with us."<br>
<br>
The big man started building a fire under the children.  Then he said to the men, "Why are your faces so nice and smooth and not rough like mine? You have nice eyes.  They don't sink way in your head like mine do."<br>
<br>
The villagers thought fast.  One of them said, "You can have a face just like ours.  We can fix you up.  Go outside and get a big flat rock and another smaller rock with a sharp end."<br>
So the big man did what they asked.  It was easy for him to carry the big flat rock because he was so strong.  Then the men of the village said to the giant, "Lie down and use this flat rock for a pillow.  We're going to fix you up just like us."<br>
<br>
"How long will it take?" he asked as he lay down and put his head on the flat stone.<br>
<br>
"Just four days," they answered.  "Close your eyes.  Close your eyes tight." Then they took the rock with the sharp end and sunk it between the big man's eyes.  He was dead.<br>
<br>
"How long is he going to lie there?" asked the giant's wife.<br>
<br>
"Oh, about four days," answered the men.  They took their children, untied their legs and removed the pitch from their eyes.  Then they went home to their village where the people were very happy.<br>

BIGFOOT.<br>
<br>
James Wallas, "Big figure and the smoked salmon," <B>Kwakiutl Legends.</B> Blaine: Hancock, 1981, p. 158-161.<br>
<br>
A family was camped by a river so that they could put up salmon for the winter.  The salmon they had caught were hanging in a split cedar smokehouse.<br>
<br>
One day before he went to bed with his family in the shelter they had made, the eldest boy went into the smokehouse and noticed some gaps between the fish that were hanging there.  "Some of our smoked salmon seems to be missing," he told his father.<br>
<br>
"We're the only ones here," his father replied.  "Our family is camped all alone.  Just forget about it-we'll get some more."<br>
<br>
The next morning when the boy built the fire in the smokehouse, he noticed even more of the smoked salmon was missing.  "Tonight I am going to hide in the smokehouse and find out who it is that is taking the salmon," he announced.  "I will have my bow and arrow with me, but if it is a man that comes I will not use it."<br>
<br>
That night they did not bank the fire very high and it soon burned out.  The boy hid in a corner of the dark smokehouse and waited.  Except for the rush of the wind in the cedar trees and the voice of the river, the camp was quiet.<br>
<br>
It was not long before the boy heard a new sound-footsteps.  Heavy footsteps were approaching the camp.  They came closer and closer and stopped just outside the smokehouse.  The boy was frightened but he had his bow and arrow ready.<br>
<br>
Slowly the roof of the smokehouse lifted up.  The boy pulled his bowstring taut.  He dimly saw a huge hairy arm reach in toward the salmon and sent his arrow where the arm was coming from.<br>
<br>
There was a terrible cry that woke up the others.  "I think I got it! I think it's the woods giant!" shouted the boy to his parents.<br>
<br>
"Let's go after him."<br>
<br>

"We will wait till morning," said his father.  "He will be a lot easier to trail in the daylight and if you wounded him he might be dead by then."<br>
<br>
The family rose early the next morning.  The boy, his father and younger brother headed out on the trail of the giant.  The trail 
they found it had a few drops of blood on it.  It led deep into the forest and ended at a cedar bark house.  A pool of fresh. water was 
nearby with a tree leaning over <B>it.</B><br>
<br>
"You wait here," the father said to his elder son, and your brother and I will skirt around the back of the house.'<br>
While he was waiting, the elder boy climbed up the tree, as it was a good place to see from.  Soon a large hairy girl came out of the cedar bark house with a bucket in her hand and walked to the pool of water that the tree leaned over.<br>
<br>
When she stooped to scoop up some drinking water, she saw the boy's reflection in the pool.  "My, I didn't know how pretty I was," she exclaimed.  "I'm different from the rest of my family.  Their eyes all sink in their heads and mine don't.  They are hairy and I have smooth skin."'<br>
<br>
The boy above her moved in the tree, and a branch broke and fell to the water.  The gi.@l jerked her head up and saw him.  "Oh, it is you that I see in the water," she cried.  Then she paused and added, "My father has been terribly sick since he came home last night.  Can you come and help him?"<br>
<br>
"I'll get my father," the boy answered.  "This must be where the person lives who was stealing fish from us," he said when he reached his father and brother.  '(I think he is very sick<br>
<br>
from my arrow.  His daughter wants us to help him."<br>
<br>
"Okay," said the father, "let us go in."<br>
<br>
They went in the cedar bark house and a big hairy man more than six feet tall lay almost dead with an arrow deep in his chest.  His wife and children were standing around him.<br>
<br>
The boy who shot the arrow walked up to the big man and tried to pull the arrow out.  It would not come out straight, and he had to twist it this way and that way.  Finally it pulled free.<br>
<B><br>

"I </B>feel better already," said the giant weakly.  "You have helped me, so I will give my daughter to one of you to marry."<br>

"No!" cried the elder boy.  "I do not wish to marry your daughter."<br>
<br>
"I do not wish to marry your daughter either," exclaimed the younger son.<br>
<br>
("'Have you another offer then?" asked the father of the two boys.<br>
"Yes, my offer is this.  You may use us on your totem pole and face mask.  No one else can make our likeness, only you.  You can make the mask just like our face."<br>
<br>
The father and his sons accepted the giant's offer and went home.  They took their arrow with them.<br>
<br>
No one else had a mask like theirs.  It was a frightening mask with the eyes sunk deep in the head.<br>

<br>
One day, Hunter was deep in the wilderness hunting for deer, elk or young he heard  a   noise   that   sounded   like   someone<br>
working with an adze.<br>
<br>
"That sounds like a canoe maker," he thought, "But who would be working this far back in the woods?" He knew that it was no<br>
one from his village.<br>
<br>
Hunter moved noiselessly toward the sound of the worker, and it led him to a clearing where a big figure was hollowing out a large cedar tree with an adze.  Her back was to him, but he could see that it was a huge figure of a woman.  Her baby was seated behind her in the hollowed-out tree.<br>
<br>
Hunter did not wish to startle the giantess, so he crept up to the back of the canoe and pinched the baby's little toe.  The infant cried out.  Without turning around the mother said, "That could be Hunter, who pinches you-the one who hunts on water and on land."<br>
<br>
The hunter pinched the baby's toe again and it started to cry.
"It's just that hunter teasing you, don't cry," said the giantess again without turning.<br>
<br>
Finally the hunter came around to the front of the woods giant's 
woman.  <B>"'Yes, </B>it is I," he said.  "'What are you making that canoe for?"<br>
<br>
"We live beside a long lake," said the giantess.  "'We will use it there.  Why have you come to me?" she asked him.<br>

<B>"I </B>followed the sound of your adze," he replied, "and now I have found you I want something from you."<br>
<br>
"What is it that you want?"<br>
<br>
"I am a provider of food for my people and I have not had much luck lately in hunting.  Can you help me?"<br>
<br>
"I will help you," responded the lady.  "I will use my power to bring elk, deer and bear to you.  When you are hunting in the water, seal will come to you."<br>
<br>
The hunter was pleased at the big woman's generosity, yet he asked her for one more favor.  "I want to use your features in a dance mask," he said.<br>
<B><br>

"If </B>you use me, you must use all of me and <B>my four children too," 
she replied.  "This baby</B> <B>is the youngest of the four.  You may 
use </B>us <B>all</B> in a <B>dance."</B><br>
<B><br>

LIMPETS<br>
<br>
James Wallas, "Big figure and the limpets," <B>Kwakiutl Legends.</B> Blaine: Hancock, 1981, p. 165-66.<br>
<br>
There were four or five children laughing and having fun on a beach.  Their parents had taken a canoe and gone to a good place for digging clams.<br>
                                                  
The children were playing on the sand near a pit in which they had built a fire.  They put rocks in the fire and, when the rocks were red hot, they baked limpets on them and ate them.  The little limpet shells fitted perfectly on the children's fingers, and they were having fun playing with them.<br>
<br>
At first they did not notice a big figure creep slowly out of the woods and advance on one of the children.  It looked like a big, big man with sunken eyes and covered with hair.<br>
<br>
Finally one child spotted him but made no outward indication that he had noticed.  He whispered to the others, "It's Big Figure.  Don't scream, don't run away.  Pretend you are not afraid."<br>
All the children put limpet shells on their fingertips and circled around to the other side of the huge figure so they were between him and the forest.<br>
<br>
The giant turned toward them, his back to the fire.  The children were trembling but the eldest bravely said, "We are ones that can scare people too - " They opened and closed their fingers as if they were blinking.  Slowly they advanced on the giant, continuing to blink their fingers with the limpet shells on the tips.<br>
<br>
Big Figure started backing up as the children advanced.  He took several steps and suddenly tumbled backward into the pit with the red hot stones in it.  The big creature was badly burned, and the jack-knife position he found himself in made it hard for him to get up.<br>
<br>
"Cover him up! Cover him up!" screamed the children, and they quickly buried him with sand and gravel.<br>
<br>
When the parents returned to the beach where they had left their children, the giant was dead.  "We might not have been here when you came back," the eldest child cried, as all the children ran down to meet their parents'canoe.  They -all spoke at once.  "Big Figure was here!" they said.  "We buried him in the cooking pit."<br>

<br>
One  by  one,  the  strange-looking  pieces of plaster are
removed  from  the  shelves of a specimen cabinet and laid ever so gently on a nearby tabletop.  There is a mysterious sort of 
drama to all of this, a solemn formality with which these objects are presented that seems to demand a hushed respect, as if the Shroud of Turin were being placed before us by some mystical keeper of church secrets.<br>
<br>
But Dr. Grover S. Krantz, the tall-bearded man making this presentation, is an anthropologist.  And the curious display offered here in his cluttered second-floor research lab at Washington State University is not one of ancient theological artifacts but of modem scientific evidence.<br>
<br>
Arranged side by side on the tabletop are six chalk-white plaster castings of footprints.  At first glance, they appear as if they might have been made from human tracks, but their enormous size quickly rules that a preposterous conclusion.  No man could have made these tracks-at least, not with his own feet.<br>
<br>
They measure up to 18 inches from heel to toe and seven inches across at the ball of the foot.  A person belonging to feet this big would stand eight feet tall and weigh in at a monstrous 750 pounds.  He would wear a size 28 shoe.<br>
<br>
Unusual? Highly so.  But, quite frankly, so is this scientist and the subject to which he has devoted nearly two decades of profes-
sional research.<br>
<br>
An associate professor of physical anthropology at WSU, Krantz is a specialist in the study of human evolution.  For the past 19 years, he has been working to scientifically document and iden-
tify a creature that he believes may be the missing link between man and ape.  There is no doubt in Krantz's mind that such a being exists.  He is equally certain that it inhabits our own backyard.  As evidence, Krantz offers these plaster footprint castsproof, he insists, that a species of giant bipedat primates dwells undetected in the mountainous wilds of the Pacific Northwest.<br>
<br>
"Does the creature we call Sasquatch actually exist?" Krantz asks rhetorically.  "Absolutely.  Any reservations I have about it are along the order of whether the sun will rise in the east tomorrow.  "<br>
<br>
Krantz's belief that these huge hairy beings have life beyond the pages of the supermarket tabloids has made him something of a toner in academic and scientific circles, where Sasquatch gener-
ally enjoys about as much credibility as the theory that Mars is populated by a race of little green men.<br>

One WSU official describes Krantz's dogged devotion to the pur-
suit of Sasquatch as "an embarrassment to the university." Many scientists say his theory has been bulk on hearsay and evidence supplied to him by kooks and crazies.  Some portray him as a well-intentioned dupe taken in by a patently ridiculous hoax.<br>
<br>
Krantz himself is well aware of his isolation from the mainstream on this matter.  The school supports his research "only to the extent that I have not been fired," he says.  Krantz admits that the professional slurs do sometimes sting, but they have not driven him from the creature's trail.<br>
<br>
"Believe me, this is not a distinction I sought," Krantz booms, a sharp edge of irritation cutting through his deep voice.  "My life would have been much simpler if I had just dismissed Sasquatch out of hand as everyone else does.  The problem is, I have examined all of the evidence, considered the variety of possible explanations, and finally I have reached the conclusion that there is a valid scientific basis for this.  Sasquatch is not an apparition from the bottom of a whiskey bottle.  It is as real as you or 1. "<br>
<br>
It is the WSU professor's studied opinion that Sasquatch is a direct descendant of the Gigantopithecus, a prehistoric primate that some evolutionary theorists have held out as an answer to the missing-link puzzle.  Scientific knowledge of this creature, too, is sketchy, based on two skull fragments found in China.  In the summer of 1982, Krantz traveled to China for a firsthand look at these ancient skull fragments.<br>
<br>
After carefully examining them himself and comparing notes with others, he has determined that these skulls encased the brains of primates that walked the earth between one and four million years ago.<br>
<br>
Krantz's estimate closely matches those of other scientists, and it fits the Gigantopithecus into the general time frame associated by many with the evolutionary split that marked the beginning of man's rise above other primates.  The most common theory on Gigantopithecus, however, is that it became extinct a few thousand years after this split occurred.  Here is where Krantz deviates from the accepted thesis.<br>
<br>
The species did not die, he says.  It has survived, evolved and migrated.  At the contemporary end of this line, he maintains, is the North American Sasquatch.<br>
<br>
Whether it is descended from Gigantopithecus, as Krantz the-
orizes, or sprang whole from the imaginative human mind, Sas
-
quatch has made its presence fek here in the Northwest for as long as man himself has inhabited this part of the world.  Such a creature can be found in the tribal mythology of virtually every native people from coastal British Columbia to Northern California.<br>
<br>
Puget Sound tribes shared a knowledge of a race of hairy giants that came down from the mountains to steal salmon from their nets and drying racks.  They called these creatures tse-at-ko.<br>
<br>
The Indians of the Blue Mountain region of southeastern Washington told of the frightening stiya-hama-tall, smelly, manlike monsters that lurked deep in the mountain forests.  The very word Sasquatch is an anglicization of sas-kets, the term used by the Salish-speaking tribes of southwestem British Columbia's lower Fraser River Valley to describe the hairy, manlike giants they believed lived nearby and communicated among themselves with shrill screams and whistles.<br>
<br>
Perhaps the earliest recorded mention of Sasquatch can be found in a letter written in April 1840 by the Reverend Elkanah Walker, a Protestant missionary to the Spokane Indians.  Preserved today in the archives of the Holland Library on the WSU campus, Walker's letter offers a skeptical but detailed interpretation of the Indians' lore:<br>
<br>
...I suppose you will bear with me if I trouble you with a little of their superstition, which has recently come to my knowledge.  They believe in the existence of a race of giants which inhabit a 
certain mountain off to the west of us <B>.... </B>The account that they give of these Giants will in some measure correspond with the Bible account of this race of beings.<br>
<br>
They say their track is about a foot and a half long.  They will carry two or three beams upon their back at once.  They frequently come in the night and steal salmon from their nets and eat them raw.  If the people are awake they always know when they are coming<br>
very near, by their strong smell, which is most intolerable.  It is not uncommon for them to come in the night and give three 
whistles and then the stones will begin to hit their houses.  <B>The 
</B>people believe that they are still troubled with their nocturnal visits.  We need the prayers of the church at home ...<br>
<br>
John Green, a retired newspaper publisher who now makes his home in Harrison Hot Springs, BC, is an amateur Sasquatch researcher who has written five books on the subject.  Although he has never seen one, Green believes that these creatures exist.  The reason that conventional science doesn't agree, he says, is that "scientists have never been willing to took at this thing with open minds.  They just dismiss it as a quaint bit of Indian lore," much as Elkanah Walker did in his letter nearly 150 years ago.
For the past 25 years, Green has been keeping a systematic record of Sasquatch sightings and footprint discoveries in the United States and Canada.  He has files on more than 2,500 reported sightings, about half of which predate his record keeping and were found in books, old newspapers and other sources.<br>
<br>
Since the 1960s, Green has been classifying new reports by state or province of origin, as well as other geographic and climatic categories.  Washington, with 347 Sasquatch sightings in the past 25 years, leads his list, followed by California, with 325, British Columbia, 274, and Oregon, 199.<br>
<br>
Perhaps the most intriguing of Green's statistical categories is the one dealing with precipitation.  Eighty percent of the sight-
ings and footprint finds he has noted have occurred in areas receiving more than 17 inches of rainfall annually.<br>
<br>
The Northwest, of course, is widely known for its rainy climate, yet large portions of the region's interior are quite desertlike.  In such parched areas, Green has found, the Sasquatch is rarely seen.  He offers no explanation for this, just the numbers.  "I'll leave it to someone else to say why man's need to imagine these monsters should mysteriously dry up where it doesn't rain," he says.<br>
<br>
There is considerable evidence to suggest that indeed there might be something stomping around out there in the woods.  The best of it has been collected by Krantz for scrutiny in his lab.  A small network of Sasquatch enthusiasts scattered through0 ut the Northwest supplies him with a steady stream of materials for study, and although the purported hair samples they send him sometimes tum out to be chunks of black moss, he looks at everything that comes his way.  That, Krantz says, is what a 
scientist <B>is </B>supposed to do: examine and analyze the evidence available to him.<br>
<br>
Among the dozens of plaster footprint casts he has collected over the years, Krantz has only a few that carry any significant weight as evidence.  Two of them were made from footprints found in 1969 near the town of Bossburg, in northeastern Washington's Colville National Forest.  What makes these tracks so important is a crippling deformity found in the right foot.<br>
<br>
It has only four toes-the middle one is either missing or somehow raised above the other four, which have spread to fill the gap.  More significant is the distortion of the entire foot, which is bent radically inward from the heel.  Krantz calculated the natu-
ral adaptations in foot structure and stride necessary to enable
a large, heavy animal with such an anatomical deformity to walk.<br>
<br>
"It was right on," he says.  "Such an animal would have had to walk exactly as this one did: stride, angle of foot placement, dis<br>
tribution of weight-it was all exactly as it had to be."<br>
<br>
These footprints, in fact, were what converted Krantz from a Sasquatch skeptic to a believer.  "Before I examined these prints, I would have given you ten to one odds that the whole thing was a hoax," he says.  "But there is no way that everything could have been tied together so perfectly in a fake."<br>
<br>
Perhaps even more important to Krantz's argument are two sets of footprints cast in the Umatilla National Forest southeast of Walla Walla.  Both were discovered by the same man, a former US Forest Service ranger, one set in 1982 and the other in the summer Of 1987.  These casts show remarkably detailed dermal ridges, the swirling skin patterns that make up toe and fingerprints.<br>
<br>
Krantz convinced the head of the Lakewood, Colorado, police department crime lab, a fingerprint expert named Doug Monsoon to examine the older of these casts.  Monsoon who says he cmsiders the existence of Sasquatch "highly unlikely," nonetheless concluded after his 1983 analysis of the prints that they were genuine.<br>
<br>
In a written report, Monsoor said: "The size, distribution and orientation of the ridge pattems are consistent with those found on the human foot.  However, these appear to be casts of original impressions of a primate foot of a creature different from any of which I arn aware .... If hoaxing is involved, I can conceive of no way in which it could have been done."<br>
<br>
Monsoor stands by his conclusion, but admits that it troubles him.  "I have 28 years in law enforcement," he says.  "My credibility as an examiner is paramount to my career.  The last thing a man in my position can do is leave himself hanging out on a limb.  Yet after examining the casts provided to me by Dr. Krantz, I can reach no other conclusion than that they are authentic."<br>
<br>
There is other testimony and evidence supporting Krantz's theory on Sasquatch.  Even dismissing the crackpots and kooks, one is left with a number of honest, sober individuals who claim to have seen the creature.  Many of these people have fat more to lose than gain by stepping forward with eyewitness reports of bizarre monsters.  
Among those who claim to have seen a Sasquatch are Virgil Herrington, who was on duty as a Grays Harbor deputy sheriff at the time of a sighting, and Dr. Don Hepworth, holder of a doctorate in equine science and the director of the Ontario Humane Society, who says he saw two Sasquatches while vacationing in the Northwest.<br>
<br>
Then there is the Patterson-Gimlin film, shot in 1967 in the mountains of Humboldt County, California, by two Yakima men.  Of all the Sasquatch evidence that has come to light over the years, this 24-foot cellutoid strip is considered by many to be the most tangible piece of documentation ever produced.  The film shows a large, fur-covered, humanlike creature walking along a creek bed.<br>
It takes giant strides, swings its arms in natural rhythm<br>
and twice twists its massive torso to peer toward the camera, revealing what appear to be female breasts.  Krantz, who has seen 
this <B>ttim </B>countless times, says he can detect subtle muscle movement in the creature's shoulders and buttocks.  Bob Gimlin, the Yakima rancher, who was there that day, still denies that the<br>
movie is a hoax.<br>
<br>
Even if substantial weight is given to this evidence, the real problem here is that no one has yet managed to produce the goods: a Sasquatch in the flesh, either alive or dead.<br>
<br>
Until a genuine specimen is brought forth, conventional science-and perhaps most laymen as well-will continue to regard Sasquatch as nothing more than an imaginative bit of<br>
Northwest folklore.<br>
<br>
"Science is not something that is built upon anecdotes, however colorful," says Philip Haldeman, a Redmond writer who is cochair-
man of Northwest Skeptics, an organization that seeks out and challenges claims of paranormal activity.  "We aren't here to poke fun at people who claim that they have seen something like Sasquatch.<br>
<br>
It's very possible that they did see something.  A bear? A tree in the wind? A shadow in the forest at dusk? But the more a claim goes beyond the bounds of common experience, of common,sense be, nevability, the more evidence you're going to need to convince me that it's true - "<br>
<br>
Krantz admits that eyewitness reports are often unreliable, and he acknowledges that it is impossible to prove that the star of the Patterson-Gimlin film is not just a big man in a well padded fur suit.  But  the  footprints,  he  insists, are not so easy to dismiss.<br>
<br>

"Without the footprints, we could probably dismiss this whole thing as a mixture of legends and lies, with perhaps some hallucination thrown in," he says.  "There are only two Possi-<br>
ble explanations for the footprints.  One is that a well-organized, well-financed and secretive group dedicated to leaving fake tracks all over western North America, from California to Canada, is responsible.  The other is that the tracks were made by a creature that science tells us does not exist.<br>
<br>
Now, both of these explanations seem pretty ridiculous, right? So I guess the only logical conclusion is that the tracks do not exist.  Trouble is, they do exist."<br>
<br>
Krantz aside, there aren't many legitimate scientists who have given more than a smiling nod of amusement to the subject of Sasquatch.  "I don't know of a respectable scientist who would waste the time," says a colleague of Krantz's at WSU- "It's a dead end, from a researcher's point of view.  You have nothingno bones, no blood, no DNA material-that could undergo an objective analysis in the laboratory.  It's as pointless a pursuit scientifically as the man in the moon."<br>
<br>
But is it? For the scientist who could prove the existence of a new and unknown species such as Sasquatch, the rewards would be great.  Krantz understands this perhaps better than anyone.  So he has gambled $9,500 of his own money on a computerized aerial sensor made to detect heat emanating from the ground below.  The device is similar to those used by the Forest Service to find hot spots in burned-over areas that might threaten to rekindle forest fires.<br>
<br>
Krantz believes this high-tech tool might enable him to locate the decaying body of a dead Sasquatch from a helicopter.  It should work especially well in late March or early April, when a frozen body would thaw and put off heat against a cold high-country backdrop of Northwest snow.<br>
<br>
Krantz had hoped to find a financial backer to pick up the $400-an-hour tab for chartering a helicopter last spring.  A Japanese television producer had exhibited interest in the project, but then backed out.  Unable to line up another backer, Krantz was forced to alter his plans.  Rather than renting a helicopter, he decided to build his own ukralight model, using a $2,500 mail-order kit.<br>
<br>
He expects to have the machine finished and flying by September, which will give him several months of practice air time before putting into the field next spring on an actual Sasquatch search.  Krantz isn't saying where he plans to look.  That would only
bring more people into the area and doom an already difficult mission, he says.<br>
<br>
If his aerial search fails to tum up the specimen that would change his life just as surely as it would alter the thinking of scientists the world over, Krantz has one last recourse.<br>
<br>
"If I could come up with the money," he says, "I would hire a team of expert trackers and hunters and send them off into the mountains with very specific instructions: Bring me a Sasquatch, dead or alive.<br>

<br>
John Green, "Meet the Sasquatch," <B>On the Track of the Sasquatch.</B> Agassiz, British Columbia: Cheam Publishing Ltd, 1969. p. 1-8.<br>
<br>
(Please note: The following is the first chapter in Mr. Green's book which contains a total of seventy-eight pages of information. Other chapters include information about physical evidence, footprints, the Roger Patterson movie, sightings at Bluff Creek, Blue Creek Mountain, and Ape Canyon. A "news" account quoted by Mr. Green which was written by humorist Eric Nicol and published in the Vancouver Daily Province has also been omitted).<br>
<br>
Early on an evening in mid August of this year-(1968) two men from Stewart, British Columbia were driving down an old mine access road.  They had been hunting grouse but were also on the lookout for bear.<br>
<br>
Still above 4, 000 feet when the daylight started to wane, they rounded a corner and jumped from the truck as what they thought was a bear started to move off into the bush above the road.<br>
<br>
Guns in hand, they stopped short as they realized that their quarry was walking up the hill on its hind legs, then gaped in
astonishment when the hairy beast swung to look back at them, twisting its wide shoulders around because it had no neck to twist.<br>
<br>
They had a brief glimpse of a dark face with a wisp of beard, a flat nose and a "What the Hell are you doing here" expression.  Then it turned again and quickly vanished among the trees.<br>
<br>
It left behind an impression of great height and weight, and an overpowering stench.<br>
<br>
One of the men later estimated its height at well over seven feet and its weight at over 300 pounds, it did not look fat,. but its build was very heavy.  It stood straight, yet its arms swung several inches lower than its knees.  Once it grabbed a tree with its left hand as it went uphill, but its hands never touched the ground.<br>
<br>
On the body the hair looked thin, but on the head it was quite long, hiding the ears.<br>
<br>
What can you make of a story like that'? Not much perhaps, because there's no way to prove it true or false.  But there's one thing you definitely can not make of it. It is not a legend. It's a matter of fact, an account of something two ordinary people claim to have seen just the other day.<br>
<br>
Perhaps that's the only point there's any real hope of making in a book about the " legendary" hairy giants of the Pacific Coast, they are not a story out of the past.  The evidence of their existence, whatever it may be worth, is concentrated overwhelmingly in the present.  Right here, right now.<br>
<br>
I call giants "Sasquatch" because that is what they are called by the Indians living near my home at Harrison Hot Springs.  Up and down the coast they have other names, and most of those names are also of Indian origin.  But that doesn't make the Sasquatch an Indian legend.... the Indians had words for all the other animals too.<br>
<br>
The difference is that for the other animals the white man brought his own names with him.  He has never named the Sasquatch because no matter how often he sees them he refuses to accept that they are there.<br>
<br>
Among Indians there are other names with much wider distribution than "Sasquatch", which seems limited to the south, western corner of British Columbia, and <B>is</B> an Anglicized word at that.  But "Sasquatch" has gained wide acceptance in the white community rivaled only by the "Bigfoot" of Northern California---because it
was under that name that the creatures received their first press notices, back in the 1920's and 1930s<br>
<br>
The man who did the writing was J. W.Burns, who was for many years a teacher at the Chehalis Indian Reserve, on the Harrison River near Harrison Hot Springs.  His articles achieved wide circulation in newspapers and magazines in the United States and Canada.- Like most native British Colombians, I read some of his stories as. a child.  Burns got his stories from his Indian friends, and some of them smacked heavily of the supernatural.<br>
<br>
Thus Burns deserves not only the credit for introducing the Sasquatch to the general public, but also the blame for affixing firmly to it the label of "Indian Legend."<br>
<br>
When I bought a weekly newspaper at Agassiz, B. C. 14 years ago, I was aware that I was in the area occupied by Mr  Burns' Sasquatch; in fact I once wrote an "April Fool" story for my paper<br>
about one of the hairy monsters kidnapping a beautiful guest from the Harrison Hot Springs Hotel.<br>
<br>
Of course I never took the subject seriously. Mr. Burns had left the area so many years before; the Sasquatch Days held at Harrison Hot Springs were a thing of the past and about the only reminder of the old stories was the "Sasquatch Inn" a small hotel on the highway No. 7 near the Harrison River.<br>
<br>
That situation continued for four years until Rene Dahinden, a Swiss immigrant is mid 20's- turned up at my office in Harrison<br>
with the announcement that he intended to go in to the mountains and look for the Sasquatch.  I tried to persuade him that the whole thing was just a tall story and referred him to a couple of veteran woodsmen whom I knew would assure him that there was no such thing to be found.<br>
<br>
He declined to be discouraged, but another man he had brought with him from his home town of Lumby, B. C. backed out, and after a few days Rene went home.<br>
<br>
The following Year the subject came up again when the Village council at Harrison Hot Springs was discussing what to do with about  $600 available for a "permanent project" to mark British Columbia's hundredth birthday.  Not much of a permanent nature<br>
can be built for $600,  and one of the council members suggested using the money for a statue of the Sasquatch.<br>
<br>
The next suggestion was that the money be used for a- " Sasquatch hunt".  This was greeted with enthusiasm , but since it was not the type of thing authorized by the provincial government for a project, permission had to be sought from the British Columbia
Centennial Committee. It was, of course, a bid for publicity, and it was tremendously successful. Papers all over Canada played the story on the front page.<br>
<br>
There were numerous offers from would be Sasquatch hunters, even from young ladies prepared to act as bait....<br>
<br>
Perhaps never before has a tourist resort achieved such publicity without actually doing anything.  Rene Dahinden came back to lead the search. Newspaper and radio reporters flocked around, and a tide of delighted stories rolled round the world touching Sweden, India, New Zealand and points between.  No matter that the prov-
incial Centennial Committee turned down the whole project and the "hunt" never took place.<br>
<br>
Public attention remained focussed on the Sasquatch for months, with the news media doing their own digging to come up with fresh angles to keep the subject alive.  In the process they dug up some stories that didn't  fit the accepted pattern.<br>
<br>
The Sasquatch with which Mr. Burns' readers were familiar were basically giant Indians.  Although avoiding civilization, they had clothes, fire, weapons and the like, and lived in villages.  They were called hairy giants it is true, but this was taken to mean that they had long hair on their heads, something along the lines of today's hippies.<br>
<br>
William Roe, of Cloverdale, B. C. , claimed to have seen something quite different.  He described a six-foot female weighing somewhere near three hundred pounds and covered from head to foot with dark brown, silver-tipped hair less than an inch in length.<br>
<br>
This creature, which he had encountered in a <B>mountain</B> clearing in the Fall of 1955, made <B>a</B> meal of leaves which it stripped off a bush with its teeth.  It wore no clothes.<br>
<br>
Following its tracks, he could find no sign that it had any tools or weapons. It slept on the ground without shelter.He was left in doubt whether it was animal or human.<br>
<br>
Publication of his story brought him a letter from Albert Ostman, of Port Langley, who claimed to have been carried off by one of the creatures, and to have spent several days with four of them in an alpine valley.  He described in detail a mature male -and female, a young male and an adolescent female.<br>
<br>
All were clothed only in short hair and the big male was eight feet tall and very heavy.  He thought that they were some sort of humans, but they lived on roots and leaves.  Certainly these were not the Sasquatch of the earlier newspaper and magazine stories.  Nor were they characters from Indian legends.  
The men concerned were not Indians and they claimed to have been personally involved in the events they described.- Mr. Roe's experience had taken place only two years before.<br>
<br>
<B>The Ruby Creek Incident</B><br>
<br>
The Roe and Ostman stories were interesting, but they were only stories.  There was no one else involved with whom they could be checked, and no records from the time and place where they were supposed to have happened.  It was another incident altogether that forced me to begin taking the-subject seriously---one in which there were plenty of supporting witnesses and even a certain amount of documentation.<br>
<br>
The events had taken place some 13 years before, and had been brought to public attention, as was usual in those days, by Mr. Burns.  The story, <B>in </B>the Vancouver Province, October 2l, 1941, was inconspicuously placed on Page l2, under the heading-.<br>
<br>
"Huge Bear Terrorizes Indians"<br>
<br>
A child's scream, the uproar of dogs and a frightened woman's hurried glance led to tales among Ruby Creek Indians today of a huge hairy monster preying on their encampment.<br>
<br>
"It turned out to be a bear--but a huge one.<br>
<br>
"Rosie, small daughter of Mrs.George Chadwick, an Indian, was playing in her garden, half a mile east of Ruby-Creek when she suddenly looked up to see the enormous beast approaching.  She screamed for help.<br>
<br>
"Her mother rushed to her, got one glimpse of the monster, swept the children her arms and dashed into the bush, where she remained for three hours before venturing home again.<br>
<br>
" On her return she found the racks of salted salmon scattered in every direction, but nothing else about the premises was touched.<br>
<br>
"In describing the animal, Mrs.Chadwick declared it was 10 feet tall, hairy, with a human face.<br>
<br>
"Little credence was given to the story until the beast returned.  This time it left tracks revealing it to be one of the largest
bears ever known in the vicinity. Its hind foot marks measured eight inches across and eighteen inches long.  The span between the strides was five feet.<br>
<br>
"The Indians have requested the assistance of a game warden to destroy the monster.<br>
<br>
That isn't a Sasquatch story, of course.  No mention of a Sasquatch anywhere in it.  In the first paragraph it started off promisingly enough, talking of "a huge hairy monster", but in the next line "it turned out to be a bear.  "<br>
<br>
Still, a little study makes it look like a doubtful sort of bear story.  "Ten feet tall,. . . with a human face" cannot successfully be applied to any bear.  Then we come to the tracks "revealing it to be one of the largest bears ever known in the vicinity.  " It had hind feet "eight inches across and eighteen inches long.  The span between the strides was five feet.  "<br>
<br>
No bear on record could account for that set of statistics.  Presumably the reporter and editors responsible for the story were city-bred and not observers of nature.<br>
<br>
In some ways this story is typical of newspaper accounts dealing with this subject.  It uses words packed with excitement, playing up to the readers' taste for the exotic and mysterious yarn, but on the other hand it makes a point of emphasizing the commonplace explanation.  It was only a bear after all.<br>
<br>
Four days later, this time on Page Two, the same newspaper carried another story, headed "Heres That Sasquatch Again", with an overline reading "hairy monster stalks".<br>
<br>
"Chilliwack--The Sasquatch giant monster of the Harrison Lake area is on the rampage.<br>
<br>
"Three canoes of Indians who arrived terror-stricken at Harrison Hot Springs after a flight from Port Douglas at the head of the lake are prepared to swear to that.<br>
<br>
"According to Indian officials here a Sasquatch, probably the biggest ever seen by man, turned up at the historic village this week and sent the Indians fleeing for- their lives.<br>
<br>
"The huge, hairy monster had not appeared for several years, and his sudden arrival struck terror into the hearts of the Indians.<br>
          
"Jimmy Douglas and his family were among those who saw the almost legendary man-beast.  They report that it was almost 14 feet high, almost double the height of the average Sasquatch.  The Indians fled to their canoes and paddled furiously down the lake.<br>
<br>
"J. W. Burns, one of the world's most eminent authorities on the Sasquatch reports that it is entirely probable that the huge beast is the same one which appeared a week ago at Ruby Creek, forty miles or so away.  Subsequent investigations into the Ruby Creek incident have definitely established that it was a Sasquatch and not a giant bear that terrorized the Indians there.  "<br>
<br>
Now things are beginning to look a little complicated.  It would be much simpler, and much more in the usual pattern, had the order of these stories been reversed.  The Sasquatch giant and the fleeing canoes should have been in the first story, then the matter-of-fact explanation about the bear could have tidied the whole thing neatly away.<br>
<br>
As it is the reader is left with two conflicting stories, both sounding rather unbelievable in themselves, and the final flat statement that the cause of the excitement was a Sasquatch, not a bear.  To most readers, however, this would be unlikely to cause any problem.  Introducing the bear at any stage would give the reader an acceptable explanation- -in fact had the bear never been mentioned he would probably have supplied it himself.<br>
<br>
In any event the editors cannot have been under any illusion that there really was a Sasquatch at Ruby Creek, since they did not have the story followed up in any way.<br>
<br>
Until the Harrison Sasquatch Hunt hit the headlines I had never heard of this incident, although Ruby Creek is only twelve miles up the Fraser River from Agassiz.  But with-all the publicity going on, the subject of Sasquatches tended to come in many conversations, and it did so when my -wife and I were visiting Jack Kirkman, game guide at Harrison Hot Springs, and his wife Martha, who is an Indian.<br>
<br>
Martha Kirkman told us the story of the Sasquatch at Ruby Creek as it had been told to her by her cousin Jeannie Chapman, (not Chadwick), the woman who saw the creature.  Mrs. Kirkman also said that when she was young there were places, in the woods the children were not allowed to go because the Sasquatches were there.<br>
<br>
She did not say that she herself believed such creatures existed, but she did impress on us very strongly that Mrs. Chapman was serious in telling her story, and indeed had suffered a shock that changed her whole life.
On the same weekend, Bill Rae, a printer who worked for me, was told the same story by Esse Tufting, the head custodian of Agassiz High school, who had lived at Ruby Creek at that time.  He had not seen the creature itself but was one of many local people who had studied the footprints it left behind, and had found that the tracks confirmed Mrs. Chapman's account of the creature's movements.<br>
<br>
Thoroughly intrigued, I went to see, Mr. Tufting, who repeated his story and drew an outline of the footprint for me on the floor of a room he was building.  His story, and the size of the print he-drew, were impressive. He was a man whom I already knew, and whom I knew to have a good reputation in the community.   When he said that he had actually seen these huge footprints I had no grounds to doubt him.<br>
<br>
Through him, I was also able to locate half a dozen more people who had been present at that time and had seen the prints.  Their recollections varied considerably, but all but one agreed that the prints could not have been made by any man or known animal.  The lone exception insisted it must have been a bear, but he agreed with the others that it had walked on- its'hind legs and had stepped over a four-foot fence.<br>
<br>
I also went to see Mr. and Mrs. Chapman, and talked to them on two occasions, and I visited the Chapmans' house--which had stood abandoned since that time.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Chapman told me that one of her children hid come to the house shouting about a "big cow coming out of the woods." She looked out the window and saw a  manlike creature about eight feet tall and covered all over with fairly dark hair.  It was walking across a field towards the house.  She did not see its face from close up, but she was sure it had a flat nose not a snout like a bear.<br>
<br>
Bears were very common  around Ruby Creek At that time, and she was thoroughly familiar with their appearance.<br>
<br>
Although terrified, Mrs. Chapman was still able to think clearly.  She took the children and led them out the front door, keeping the house between her and the creature.  They crossed a stretch of field and got down to the river, where a high bank shielded them from view.<br>
<br>
She didn't know if the Sasquatch saw them but it did not try to follow.  The tracks later showed that the creature had circled the house and entered a shed where there was a barrel of salt salmon.<br>

He sampled this- there was some disagreement about whether he had lifted and-dumped it, but in any event there was torn fish scattered around.  Then he went down to the river, perhaps to wash the salt out of his mouth , and returned to the mountain.<br>
<br>
I did not consider her story reliable as to detail, particularly as it was not entirely consistent, and I have since read accounts in which she is quoted as having said things that do not agree with some of the <B>things </B>she said to me.<br>
<br>
I have noticed since that time that some people with scientific training tend to reject an entire story if they can find fault with something in it--even a detail that has nothing whatever to do with the subject at hand.  Several years as a reporter covering court cases have given me a more realistic view of the average person's ability to remember.<br>
<br>
No two witnesses, however impartial, ever have the same recollection of details of the same event, and it is rarely that a witness who is testifying at any length gives precisely the same information at the trial that he gave at the preliminary examination.<br>
<br>
On the other hand most people (some politicians excepted) do not lie very convincingly under questioning, and I was quite certain Mrs. Chapman believed what she told me.<br>
<br>
Later I talked to a son of the late Joe Dunn, a deputy Sheriff of Whatcom County in Washington, who had investigated the Ruby Creek incident at the time.  Apparently Sheriff Dunn was already inter-
ested in the subject through experiences of his own.  At his home I found a report written by him generally confirming-what I had learned myself and was able to copy a tracing of a footprint.<br>
<br>
But that time I had also been in touch with  William Roe and Albert Ostman, and had heard two or three more reports of sightings of something that was more like an erect ape than the giant hairy Indians of the Sasquatch stories.<br>
<br>
Interviewing people and gathering facts is my regular occupation, and if I were being fooled very  often my readers would be bringing it to my attention.  'These stories <B>rang</B> true to me, but I took  the additional step of having them legally sworn to.<br>
<br>
In the case of Albert Ostman. and the people involved at Ruby Creek, I even had them cross-examined by the local magistrate, formerly a trial lawyer of considerable reputation.  I took what I had gathered to the University of B. C. , expecting that
scientists would want to investigate the matter.  I still had a great deal to learn.<br>

SASQUATCH.<br>
<br>
Sidney Warren, "Sasquatch--sort of," <B>Farthest Frontier. The Pacific Northwest.</B> New York: The Macmillan Company, 1949. p.159-
62.<br>
<br>
The people who came to the Northwest found a land of enormous reaches, of towering, crag like mountains and gigantic trees.  Everything was on a vast scale.  And the fanciful stories, the folklore, the legends, and the tall tales that they brought with them were made even taller, as though in keeping with their new surroundings.<br>
<br>
As early as the fifties, newspapers entertained their readers with amazing stories-not the pseudoscientific kind popular in the later, more sophisticated societies-but tales fabricated out of whole cloth and the more incredible the better.<br>
<br>
There was the story, for instance, published on the front page of the Statesman in 1857, which began: "A most wonderful and thrilling adventure has recently occurred in the southern part of this county. . . ." It seems that a few weeks "since," a man and a boy started out in quest of some lost cattle and, being<br>
overtaken  by  night,  lay  down  to   sleep.   Toward   midnight-the   witching hour-the boy was awakened by a loud plaintive cry.<br>
<br>
He jumped to his feet, without disturbing his companion, and ran but a few yards when he saw before him-but let the narrator continue in his own inimitable words and style:<br>
<br>
He observed an object approaching him that appeared like a man about twelve or fifteen feet high ... with glaring eyes which had the appearance of equal balls of fire.  The monster drew near to the boy who was unable from fright, to move a single step, and seizing him by the arm, dragged him forcibly away towards the mountains, over logs, underbrush, swamps, rivers and land with a velocity that seemed to our hero like flying.<br>
<br>
They had traveled in this manner perhaps an hour, when the monster sunk upon the earth apparently exhausted.  Our hero then became aware that this creature was indeed a wild man, whose body was
completely covered with shaggy brown hair, about four inches in length; some of his teeth protruded from his mouth like tushes, his hands were armed with formidable claws instead of fingers, but his feet, singular to relate, appeared natural, being clothed with moccasins similar to those worn by Indians.<br>
<br>
Our hero had scarcely made these observations when the "wild man" suddenly started onward as before, never for a moment relaxing his grip on the boy's arm.... They had not proceeded far before they entered an almost impenetrable thicket of logs and undergrowth, when the "wild man" stopped, reclined upon a log, and gave one shriek, terrific and prolonged, the reverberations of which seemed to continue for the space of five minutes; immediately after which the earth opened at their feet, as if a trap door, ingeniously contrived, had just been raised.<br>
<br>
Entering at once this subterranean abode by a ladder rudely constructed of hazel brush, they proceeded downward, perhaps 150 or 200 feet, when they reached the bottom of a vast cave, which was brilliantly illumined with a peculiar phosphorescent light, and water trickled from the sides of the cave in minute jets....<br>
<br>
Above, the cave seemed slightly arched, the ceiling apparently composed of sea shells . . . the bottom was ... thickly strewn ... with the bones of many kinds of animals....<br>
<br>
As our hero thus closely observed the interior of this awful cave, the "wild man" left him. . . . Presently the huge monster returned by a side door, leading gently by the hand a young and delicate female of almost miraculous grace and beauty, who had doubtless been immured in this dreadful dungeon for years....... The young lady fell upon her knees, and in some unknown language..... seemed to plead for the privilege of remaining forever in the cave.......<br>
<br>
This singular conduct caused our hero to imagine that the "wild man" conscience stricken, had resolved to set at liberty his lovely victim, by placing her in charge of our hero, whom he had evidently captured for that purpose.  As this thought passed through [his] mind his ears were greeted with the strains of the most unearthly music....<br>
<br>
The "wild man" wept piteously ... and sobbing like a child, his handkerchief moist with grief, he raised her very carefully from her recumbent posture, and led her gently away as they had come.<br>
<br>
A moment afterwards, the damsel returned alone, and advanced toward our hero with lady-like modesty and grace, placed in his hands a beautifully embossed card, upon which appeared the following words, traced in the most exquisite hand evidently the lady's own, "Boy, depart hence, forthwith, or remain and be devoured." 
Our hero looked up, but the lady had vanished.... He acted at once upon the hint . . . and commenced retracing his steps towards the "ladder of hazel brush" which he shortly reached and commenced the ascent.  Upon arriving at the top, his horror may be imagined when he found the aperture closed! The cold sweat stood on his brow, his frame quivered with mental agony, when ... he bethought himself of a small barlow knife ... with which he instantly commenced picking the earth....<br>
<br>
After laboring in this manner ... he was rejoiced to see daylight through the earth, and he was not much longer in working a hole large enough through which he was enabled to crawl.<br>
<br>
The adventure ends with our hero wandering around for a day and a night until he met a small party of miners, prospecting on the headwaters of South Umpqua River, to whom he told his story.  They listened in silence, apparently not believing a word, but they were unable to account for his presence in that desolate region and, after feeding him, directed him home.<br>
<br>
He related his tale to his father, who called in the neighbors and the circuit preacher.  "At first they smiled, then doubted, then believed; and the whole neighborhood are now prepared to make affidavit to the principal facts.  The boy is a mild, modest, moral boy . . . his parents are moral and religious people, and it is hoped that out of respect to their feelings, the story will not be disbelieved as a general thing, although many parts are truly wonderful."<br>

HAIRY  GIANTS<br>
<br>
C. P.Lyons. "The hairy giants of Laidlaw, "Milestones on the Mighty Fraser, Toronto: J. M Dent and Sons, 1950. p. 28-30.<br>
<br>
Laidlaw  is  a  small  station   on   190-0 the Canadian National Railroad.  Close to it is an Indian Reserve.  There are many such small reserves along the Fraser River, but this one had the doubtful honor not long ago of playing unwilling host to a fearsome hairy giant.<br>
<br>
Indian lore has it that a mysterious race of giants, known as the Sasquatch, live in the high mountains around Harrison Lake.  Over the years, various Indians have reported brief encounters with these individuals.  Such stories are not easily discounted, for the Indians have a remarkable memory for detail and find little purpose in distorting the facts as they know them.
Various people in close contact with the Indians have no doubts that, at least, the remnants of such a race do exist in the hidden fastnesses of the Coast Mountains.  One or two expeditions have even attempted to investigate, but were forced back by extremely rough and hostile terrain.<br>
<br>
The following instances are only two of the many stories told by the Indians.  They were related in all seriousness by an Indian woman living near Laidlaw.<br>
<br>
"Over a hundred years ago, when the Indians were berrypicking, one woman who liad strayed from the others was suddenly confronted by a giant.  Too paralyzed with fear to scream or run, she was quickly carried up the steep mountain side.  After a long climb, during which time she remained in a semicoma and so did not note direction or length of time, she was carried through a rough door into a large rock cave.<br>
<br>
"Two other Indian women were crouched in the cave and, when left alone with the new arrival, told her they had been captured in a similar manner years ago.  They had been brought as wives for the giants and had since borne children.<br>
<br>
"The men would disappear for months at a time and then return with food.  For the new woman they brought flour and smoked fish that they knew she was accustomed to eating. (The fact that there was flour dates the story as taking place after the arrival of the Hudson's Bay Traders, 1827-1840).<br>
<br>
"Although the woman had been a captive for over a year and had borne a child, she was determined to escape.  The other two women told her they would help and when the hairy giants left on one of their seasonal hunting trips she was told to prepare all the food she could.  She made bread, or bannock, (suggesting that these people or the Indian women at least used fire) and with a heavy pack of food set out across the mountains.<br>
<br>
"After almost unendurable hardships she became exhausted and was carried and helped along by the other two women who possessed the giants' strength in some measure.  She was left in a stupor near where she had originally disappeared.<br>
<br>
"The villagers saw her but she suddenly became afraid of them and fled.  She was pursued and carried to her father's house where she fainted and remained under a spell.  The Indians believed that the giants held some mental power over her but with careful nursing she eventually recovered."<br>
<br>
The second episode is still fresh in many of the Indians' memories.<br>
"Several years ago, in the vicinity of Laidlaw, a hairy giant entered a house and caused a woman and her two children to flee in terror.  Later, footprints approximately 20 inches long were found
<br>
clearly imprinted in the mud along the route the woman had taken.  Although she was not captured, she has since refused to live in the house.<br>
<br>
"Hair caught in the door-jamb was reported reddish in color.  A 40-gallon barrel of salted fish had been picked up and dumped over, and the retreating footprints showed that the "Sasquatch" had merely stepped over the railroad fences and returned directly to the steep mountain slopes."<br>

Alaska's Bigfoot<br>
<br>
Mary J. Barry, Alaska's Ghosts, Enigmas, Outlaws and Things That Go Bump!  Anchorage: MJP Barry.  1994., p.73-5.<br>
<br>
Bigfeet have been reported in several parts of Alaska. The Tlingit Indians of Southeastern Alaska called it "Kushtaka." The Den'aina Indians of Southcentral named it "Nant'ina." The Eskimos of southwest Alaska call it "Urayuli" or "Hairyman."<br>
<br>
John Active, a Yup'ik story teller from Bethel, has gathered a large number of accounts told by the Yup'ik people of Southwest Alaska concerning their encounters with Urayuli.  This being was described as standing ten feet tall, covered with hair, with glowing eyes.  Its arms were so long, they reached to the creature's ankles.  It was said to roam the tundra and cry out its loneliness with a voice resembling that of a loon.<br>
<br>
Although its appearance terrified the persons confronting it, the Urayuli never harmed anyone, according to the accounts gathered by Active.  However, lore has it that children who disappear while in the woods are transformed into Urayuli.<br>
<br>
The Southeastern Kushtaka has a less benevolent reputation.  The Natives feared the creature and avoided its habitat.<br>
<br>
Harry D. Colp described a miner's encounter with the Kushtaka, in an account which was later published as "The Strangest Story Ever Told." Colp and three other prospectors teamed up in 1900 at Wrangell.  They sent Charlie, one of the four, to Thomas Bay to look over a gold prospect, while the others sought grubstakes to pay their expenses.  Charlie went about 50 miles up the coast to this location. There the rains kept him confined to his tent for several days.  He then went out, trying to locate the landmarks given to him by an Indian.<br>
<br>
By chance, he found a gold-flecked quartz ledge and loosened a
piece with his gun, breaking his gun stock in the process.  As he was taking his bearings, he said, a troupe of creatures he called "devils," that looked like both men and monkeys, swarmed after him.  These shaggy beasts, with long, coarse hair, stinking and covered with sores, pursued him back to his canoe.  During the chase, they screamed and scraped his back with "long clawlike fingers."<br>
<br>
Charlie said he came to in his canoe, which was drifting at sea.  He was cold, hungry and thirsty.  He returned to his comrades with nothing but the clothes on his back, his canoe and oars, and the chunk of gold quartz.  He declared he had enough of Alaska.  In exchange for his passage back to Seattle, he told his tale to the other three.<br>
<br>
Two more of Colp's partners returned to the site of the gold-speckled quartz ledge.  Once again, they returned with strange tales of "devils." One of the partners was said to have gone mad.<br>
<br>
Other prospectors who scouted the same area were reported by Colp to have suffered frightening experiences and to have behaved in a strange manner afterwards.  Mysterious happenings occurred as late as 1925, when a farmer reported losing a dog in the hills there, but finding strange tracks, with the hind feet resembling a cross between a bear's and a human's footprints.  A trapper in the area disappeared.  Searchers found his outfit and tracks, but no trace of the man.<br>
<br>
The Iliamna region not only has a fish monster, but also is a home to Big Man, as the Natives call him here.  For years, Big Man has been blamed for stealing fish from the villages and for mysterious disappearances of people.<br>
<br>
More recently, Federal Aviation Administration worker Jim Coffee said an eight-foot humanoid almost ran him off the road in Newhalen, near Lake Iliamna.  That same night, a woman living nearby reported that a Bigfoot left watermelon-sized footprints in her yard and tore down her laundry.  Investigators found huge footprints along the side of the road.  At 24 inches long, they were the largest Bigfoot prints ever found.<br>

GIANTS<br>
<br>
Marian Smith, "Giants," <B>The Puyallup-Nisqually.</B> New York: AMS Press, 1940 p. 129-130/<br>
<br>
i.     A race of tall Indians, called "wild" or "stick" Indians, was said to wander through the forests.  In general conversation they were referred to as tsia@tko although another term, steta"t, from ta't, spear, could also be applied to them.<br>
<br>
The tsi'a'tko lived by hunting and fishing.  Their homes were hollowed out like the sleeping places of animals and could not be distinguished as human habitations.  It was largely because of this lack of any houses or villages that they were characterized as "wild".<br>
<br>
They wandered freely through the wooded country, their activities being mainly confined to the hours of darkness.  As has been said, they were abnormally tall, always well over six feet.  Their language was a sort of whistle and even when people could not see them they often heard this whistle in the distance.  They had no canoes nor did they ever travel by water.<br>
<br>
The giants played pranks on the village Indians, stealing the fish from their nets at night, going off with their half-cured supplies under cover of darkness, etc.  Sometimes pranks on the persons of individual men, such as removing their clothes and tying their legs apart, were made possible by a sort of hypnotic helplessness engendered by the sound of the giants' whistle.<br>
<br>
The giants " were dangerous to men if the latter interfered with them or caused hurt to one of their members.  Under these conditions their hatred was implacable and they always tracked the culprit down until finally they killed him with a shot from their bows.  Occasionally also, they stole children or adolescents and carried them off to act as wives or as slaves.<br>
<br>
For this reason children were mortally afraid of going about alone at night and the tsia@tko threat was used in child discipline.  During the summer camping trips when mat houses with loose sides were used for shelter, children always slept in the center surrounded by their elders for fear that the tsi@tko would lift the mats and spirit them away.  Men avoided conflicts with the giants and women retained the fear of them throughout their lives.  Thus, one informant, a woman approaching seventy, broke her habit of rising before dawn and going to an outhouse at some distance from her home because she heard the whistle of a giant one morning.  This happened during the winter of 1934-5.<br>
<br>

Actual killing or capture of giants was said not to <B>hav-</B> been infrequent.  Two of the more detailed of such accounts follow:<br>
<br>
In my grandfather's time (salt water, around i850), his people captured a tsijtko boy and raised it.  The child slept all day, then went out nights when everyone else was asleep.  In the morning they would see where he had piled up wood or caught fish or brought in a deer.  Finally, they told him he could go back to bis people.<br>
<br>
He was gone many years and then came back once.  He brought his tsidtko band with him and the Indians could hear them whistle all around.  He said he came just for a visit to see them.  Then he went away for good.<br>
<br>
A man from Skykomish who was a little older than I am told me that he and some of his friends killed a tsijtko once.  There were several of them but the others got away.  It was in the daytime and maybe they couldn't see so well.  The one they killed had a bow and arrow and was dressed in some kind of skin.  Cougar, I guess.<br>

TACOMA SEA MONSTER<br>
<br>
Carol J. Lind, "Tacoma's Sea Monster," <B>Western Gothic. </B> Seattle: C.J. Lind, 1983 p. 13-15.<br>
<br>
This fish story allegedly happened on July 2, 1893, and was reported in the July 3 issue of the Tacoma Daily Ledger.<br>
<br>
The fisherman who told the tale preferred to nameless, and confided only that he and his friend were from the East.  The other three men who had been part of the three-day fishing excursion around Puget sound were from Tacoma.<br>
<br>
"The party was supplied with the necessaries of life as well as an abundance of its luxuries, though it must not be inferred from this fact the luxuries played any part in creating the sights seen on that memorable morning."<br>
<br>
"We left Tacoma July 1, Saturday, about 4:30 P.M, and as the wind was from the southeast we shaped our course for Point Defiance."<br>
He said fishing was fair until a change of wind forced them to try a trout stream which emptied into Black Fish Bay on Henderson Island.  There they made camp for the night.<br>
<br>
Sometime after midnight, the sleeping campers were startled by a terrifying noise.  A stinging sensation like thousands of electrified needle points suddenly stabbed through their clothing.<br>
<br>
The Easterner related, "The air was filled with a strong current of 
electricity that caused every nerve <B>in </B>the body to sting with pain, and a light as bright as that created by the concentrate on of many arc lights kept constantly flashing.<br>
<br>
"I turned my head in that direction,, and if it is possible for fright to turn one's hair white, then mine ought to be snow white" (the reporter taking notes indicated the Easterner's hair was still black) "for right before my eyes was a most horrible looking monster.<br>
<br>
"The monster slowly drew in toward shore and as it approached, its head poured out a stream of water that looked like blue flame."<br>
Hesitantly, the stranger described the creature as 150 feet long and thirty feet in circumference.  He confided, "Its shape was somewhat out of the ordinary insofar that the body was neither round or flat but oval.  It had coarse hair on the upper part of the body.<br>
<br>
At about every eight feet fran its heat to its tall a substance that had the appearance of a copper band encircled its body.  Blue flames came from two horn-like structures near the center of the
head.  The tail was shaped like a propeller.<br>
<br>
"Sir, I tell you, in the electrically charged atmosphere birds and insects died.  Two of my fellow fisherman became paralyzed when licked by the blue flame.     They lay on the beach until eventually recovering.. At last, the monster submerged into the dark waters and a telltale luminous light betrayed its course.<br>
<br>
"I hardly need tell you we were not long in getting underway for Tacoma, declared the Easterner, and I can assure you I have no further desire to fish any more in the waters of this bay.  There are too many peculiar inhabitants in them.<br>
<br>
The reporter wrote  the  human  interest  feature,  much  to  the  delight  of  the <B>Daily Ledger</B> readership.<br>
<br>
Was the hairy sea monster the result of ample libation among fishermen, a drunken dream enlarging the ordinary sea dwelling creature teasingly swimming in the dark beyond the campfire and the deeper dark of imagination? or did they really see something?<br>
<br>
(The Tacoma News Tribune for August 14, 1960 has a drawing of the "sea monster" by Wayne Zimmerman.).<br>

SEA SERPENTS.<br>
<br>
Paul H. LeBlond, "Sea Serpents of the Pacific Northwest," <B>Montana Magazine.</B> XLIII (Autumn, 1993) p. 44-51.<br>
<br>
The Pacific Northwest stands in sharp contrast to other parts of the American West. There are no cactuses or parched deserts in this land of rain and fog, towering forests and meandering fjords. When Lewis and Clark wintered near the mouth of the Columbia River in 1805, their foremost concern was to keep dry. They noted in their diary on Boxing Day, 1805, "...a continuation of rain, accompanied by thunder, and a high wind from the southeast. We were therefore obliged to stay in our huts and endeavored to dry out wet articles before the fire."<br>
<br>
Water plays an all encompassing role in the Pacific Northwest and it is not surprising to find that its coastal seas and wet forests continue to this day to hide unresolved mysteries.<br>
<br>
The economy of coastal tribes of the area has long rested on the rich bounty of sea and forest.  Abundant resources have left leisure time for artistic creation, and native peoples have left an artistic legacy of the region's creatures. ne sea life, in particular sea
otters with their lustrous pelts, drew English, Spanish, Americas, and Russian fur traders in keen competition for the resources of the region.<br>
<br>
European and eastem North American explorers marveled at the rich sea life, many species of whales, playful otters, seals, and birds.  They soon heard from the Indians about other, rarely seen creatures that vied with orcas for strength and speed and occasionally even ventured on land.<br>
<br>
The Manhousat people along the west coast of Vancouver Island, for example, spoke of the hiyitl'iik, or sea serpent, a semilegendary creature.' This animal was seven or eight feet long, moved quickly on land as well as on water, and could grow wings at will.  It was very rarely seen.<br>
<br>
Sea serpents remain a persistent and unsolved Pacific Northwest mystery.  Reports continue to trickle in of sightings of large, unknown marine animals in coastal waters and some large inland lakes.  Despite wide public interest in such mysterious creatures, scientists hesitate to draw conclusions or even involve themselves in the search.  Observations of sea monsters are sparse and fleet-
ing, and many scholars would rather dismiss them than seek a rational explanation.<br>
<br>
Questions regarding the existence and nature of mysterious, undiscovered animals do, however, attract some scientific attention.  Crypto zoology, a term coined by scientist Bernard Heuvelmans that derives from the Greek cryptos (hidden) and zoology (the lore of animals), describes the activity of those (crypto zoologists) who apply scientific methods to the study of hidden animals, or cryptids.1 Crypto zoology remains on the margin of the scientific mainstream.<br>
<br>
The time has passed when the discovery of new animals motivated zoological research.  There may yet exist animals unknown to science, and some of them might occasionally be glimpsed, in Scotland's Loch Ness, for example, and elsewhere.  Concern about the existence of such crypteds now attracts mostly amateurs and hobbyists.  Classically trained French zoologist Heuvelmans is a rare exception: A professional who has devoted his scientific life to the exploration of this challenging topic, scouring old manuscripts and virgin forests for evidence and writing extensively on the subject.<br>
<br>
The International Society of Crypto zoology, with offices in Tucson, Arizona, and presided over by Heuvelmans, serves, through its publications and meetings, as a focus for approximately one thousand members, divided about equally between curious amateurs and equally curious scientists from many disciplines.<br>
<br>
News of the existence of marine crypteds in the Pacific Northwest
first arose from native legends, and designs on native crafts have preserved their likenesses.  The Skagit River atlatl is one of the best known and most solidly authenticated of the prehistoric Northwest Coast artifacts.  The yew wood spear-thrower, now in the collection of the Museum of Anthropology, University of British Columbia, is crowned by a carving of a rampant sea monster with white inlaid eyes.  The artifact was dredged near the mouth of the Skagit River, and carbon-14 dating has shown that the atlatl was carved circa AD 200.<br>
<br>
Depictions of sea serpents also are common in native petro glyphs seen along the coast of the Pacific Northwest. A creature in one of the petro glyphs at the Monsell site near the Nanaimo River on Vancouver Island, bears some resemblance to the sea monster carved on the atlatl.<br>
<br>
Reports by European eyewitnesses support the native legends, drawings, and pictographs.  A classic early sighting and description by nonnatives of a sea serpent was that of prospector Osmond Fergusson and his partner, identified only as Walker, in the Queen Charlotte Islands in January 1897.  "I saw ahead of us what I thought was a piece of driftwood," Fergusson wrote,<br>
<br>
"On getting closer I noticed it was moving towards us. When within 50 yards I said to Walker, What is that? What we could see was,an object sticking out of the water about two feet.  When within a few feet of it the end uncoiled & raised a long neck out of the water with a head like a snake on it."<br>
<br>
When the animal submerged and passed near them, Fergusson wrote, they "could see a body 25 feet long tapering with a fish like tail."'<br>
Others spotted similar long-necked creatures.  One Sunday in September 1905, Philip Welch and a friend were fishing for trout in Johnstone Strait off northern Vancouver Island.  In 1970 he wrote that on that day sixty-five years earlier, an enormous salmon run at the mouth of the Adams River made it impossible to catch trout.<br>
<br>
Although it was only 9 A.M., the disappointed fishermen were re-
signed to returning home when they saw a long neck appear some two hundred yards astern their boat.  The animal submerged.  Alarmed, they rowed for shore as quickly as they could, hitting salmon with their oars at every stroke.  The creature reappeared about one hundred feet astern.  It was gaining on them when once more it submerged, and they did not see it again.<br>
<br>
The animal, Welch wrote, had a long neck, six to eight feet of which protruded above the water.  The neck, about the size of a stove pipe, tapered from a twenty-inch diameter to about ten inches at the head, which looked somewhat like the head of a giraffe.  'Me creature looked up and down Johnstone Strait, turning its head this
way and that, giving the men a good view of it.  Welch noticed two bumps on the head, about five inches high and rounded on top.  Nostrils were plainly visible but eyes were hard to detect.<br>
<br>
No mane or hair of any sort were visible.  The animal was brown in color.  Welch's report did not include a sketch; his description of the animal, however, resembles a creature observed many years later on the Oregon coast.<br>
<br>
Although stories of sea serpents continued to appear in the press and to attract public interest through the early years of this century, many scientists refused to take the evidence seriously.' The views expressed by David Starr Jordan, the first president of Stanford University and a prominent zoologist and ichthyologist, were widely shared.  Commenting in 1893 on a sea serpent sighting in the North Atlantic, Jordan insisted that<br>
<br>
the sea-serpent is a myth.  It does not receive the attention of scientific men because they have real things to attend to.  If people were not telling marvelous tales of the sea-serpent, they would find something else to tell marvelous tales about and somebody to believe them.<br>
<br>
Turn-of-the-century scientists were too busy with more readily verifiable phenomena to pay attention to fleeting eyewitness reports of hypothetical creatures.  Observers, often subjected to ridicule were hesitant to disclose findings.  For many years, the cultural climate was not favorable for the reporting of sea serpents.<br>
<br>
This changed, however, after 1933 when the British press began to pay serious attention to reports of a large "monster" in Scotland's Loch Ness, beginning with a sighting by John Mackay in April of that year.  Mackay was the innkeeper in Drumnadrochit on the north side of Loch Ness.<br>
<br>
He and his wife were returning from Inverness along the recently opened north-side road when they spotted a giant creature in the Loch.  Their report in the Inverness Courier started the interest in a Loch Ness "monster."<br>
<br>
Exactly one year later Lieutenant Colonel R- K. Wilson, a British army surgeon, captured Nessie on <B>film </B>while he was grouse hunting near Loch Ness.  By the time Wilson took his photograph in April 1934, Fleet Street journalists had transformed "Nessie" into an international celebrity.  Following the example of the British press, the former colonies assumed a similar interest in sea monster sightings.<br>
<br>
Major W. H. Langley, clerk to the British Columbia legislature, announced to a receptive audience that on Sunday, October 1, 1933, while sailing near Chatham Island, just east of Victoria, he and his
wife had heard a very loud noise, "something between a grunt and a snort accompanied by a huge hiss.  We both saw a huge object about 90 to 100 feet off ... and on the edge of the ke p just off the Chatman Island shore," he told the Victoria Daily Times.  "It was every bit as big as the back of a large whale, but entirely different in many respects.  Its color was of a greenish brown. ... It had markings along the top and sides. They seemed to be of a serrated nature."<br>
<br>
The animal was visible for only a few seconds before it dived quickly, and they saw it resurface in the distance.<br>
<br>
Encouraged by Langley's report, F. W. Kemp, an officer of the Provincial Archives of British Columbia, revealed that he and his family also had seen a strange animal in the same area the previous summer.  On August 10, 1932, they had observed a "huge creature with head out of the water travelling about four miles per hour against the tide." Kemp reported that the creature,<br>
<br>
swimming to the steep rocks of the island opposite ... shot its head out of the water on to the rock, and moving its head from side to side, appeared to be taking its bearings. nen fold after fold of its body came to the surface.  Towards the tail it appeared serrated with something moving flail-like at the extreme end.... Around the head appeared a sort of mane, which drifted round the body like kelp."<br>
<br>
Kemp and his family came back the next day and measured logs on the beach against which they had compared the creature.  One log was more than sixty feet in length.  The Kemps also drew a picture, which tallied with Langley's description (Figure 3).<br>
<br>
Archie Wills, news editor of the Victoria Daily Times, gradually developed an active interest in the strange creature.  He soon had a dozen letters from people who said they, too, had seen the sea serpent but had refrained from talking about it for fear of ridicule.<br>
<br>
Wills organized a contest to name the animal, which was dubbed "Cadborosaurus," after Cadboro Bay near Victoria, where it had been repeatedly sighted.  The name was soon abbreviated to "Caddy," a more. manageable form under which later sightings were reported.  Since then, about fifty sightings of Caddy at close range have been reported by eyewitnesses in the protected waters of the Puget Sound-Strait of Georgia system, as well as on the outer coast from Oregon to Alaska . From among the fifty reports a sampling is noted here to suggest the nature of the evidence.<br>
<br>
Mrs. E. Stout of Klamath Falls, Oregon; her sister-in-law Mrs. Fred Parson; and their two small sons, ages four and five, were walking along sandy Dungeness Spit, watching ships travel in and out of Juan de Fuca Strait.  It was the middle of March 1953, and the weather was overcast and drizzly, as it so often is on the coast during
winter months.<br>
<br>
They were watching a large freighter, about a quarter of a mile offshore, moving eastward toward Port Townsend, when they saw what appeared to be a tree limb.  Mrs. Stout wrote that the object disappeared abruptly beneath the surface and in a few seconds appeared again, much closer.  The two women made out the form of a creature and distinctly saw a large, flattish head turned<br>
away from them and toward the ship.  Mrs. Stout continued:<br>
<br>
"I think all of us gasped and pointed.  We could distinctly see three humps behind the long neck.  'Me animal was proceeding westward and at an angle toward us.  It sank abruptly again and reappeared closer, almost due north of us.  In the dim light, we could distinctly make out color and pattern, a long floppy mane, and the shape of the head.... We estimated that the length of the exposed neck was at least 6 ft. and the head probably at least twenty inches long.<br>
<br>
"As a trained biologist, I simply could not accept that long floppy mane or fin.  Yet, we all saw it.  It was a limply hanging thing.  We deduced that the humps were at least five feet.  Again, I simply could not accept their arrangement. They were close together with no visible curve .... The animal was rich deep brown with large reticulations of a bright, burnt orange.  The pattern wasn't unlike that of a giraffe except much larger. ne fin appeared to be drab or colorless.<br>
<br>
"We could see no body movements, except that the neck lowered and moved backward with grace and the head swivelled, raised and lowered.  Its forward progression was smooth, like a swan's.  It sank and rose almost perpendicularly; although there was no indication of effort, it progressed westward, toward Pt.  Angeles at a fair rate of speed.  The whole episode lasted about eight minutes."<br>
<br>
Another close-range sighting, which clearly involved an unidentified creature, was reported by David Miller and Alfred Webb, two fishermen from Victoria.  The observation occurred in midafternoon in late November 1969 about one-half mile off the Discovery Island Lighthouse in eastern Juan de Fuca Strait.  Miller wrote:<br>
<br>
"I observed this strange creature surface roughly 80 ft. on our port beam.  It started to move rapidly away from us so we speeded the engine up and gave chase.  We got within 30 ft. when it suddenly submerged, not in the method seals or sea-lions do but as though something pulled it under.  A few moments later we arrived at its place of submergence and there was a tremendous turbulence, suggesting a creature the size of a 30 ft. sea whale.<br>
<br>
"Its speed under water was also astounding as it surfaced a few minutes later over a hundred yards away.  It stayed up while we took
after it again but this time it never let us close again. ne first encounter was so close that both of us remarked about its large red eyes and short ears visible at that range .<br>
<br>
He included a sketch with his report and emphasized that of all the many kinds of marine creatures he had seen in his years at sea, none looked even remotely like that one. Marine crypteds seen along the outer Pacific Coast include one reported in 1934 by L A I-arson, first mate on the Columbia River lightship.  The animal, later described for the press as "Colossal Claude," was "about 40 feet long," Larson said.<br>
<br>
"It had a neck some eight feet long, a big round body, a mean looking tail and an evil, snaky look to its head." Claude broke into the news again in 1937 when Charles E. Graham, skipper of the troller Viv, reported sighting a "long, hairy, tan-colored creature, with the head of an overgrown horse, about 40 feet long, and with a 4-ft. waist measure."<br>
<br>
One of the best documented West Coast sightings occurred around New Year's Day 1937 about two miles south of Yachts, Oregon, just south of Cape Perpetua near a chasm in the rocky shoreline known as the Devil's Churn." The weather was stormy and the sea very rough.  The witnesses, a couple who insisted that their names be kept confidential to avoid ridicule, were sitting on a landing about thirty feet above the sea along the switchback trail that leads from the parking area near the highway to the Churn.<br>
<br>
They were watching the spectacular breakers when they saw the creature about two hundred feet due west of the mouth of the Churn.  It came directly toward the Churn, swimming slowly without any visible propelling motions and stopped for fifteen to twenty seconds close to the entrance of the chasm, about one hundred feet from the observers.<br>
<br>
The couple remarked that "the heavy breakers did not seem to toss it around one bit." A truck came by on the highway   during   that   time,   and   the   animal turned its  head  to  look  at  it,  then  looked   back   at   the witnesses,  then  again  at  the   truck.<br>
<br>
Afterwards,   it swam  south  along  the   coast,   moving   rapidly  at   a speed  the  man   estimated   to   be   twenty-five   knots.<br>
The  two   witnesses   followed   the   animal   along   the<br>
shore  highway  in  their  car.  At  an  observation   point about  a  mile  south  of  the  Churn,  they  saw  it   veer off from the coast and swim out to sea.<br>
<br>
The couple sketched the creature showing a neck,   approximately   fifteen feet long, surmounted by a head described by one witness  as  like  that  of a  horse  or camel and by the other as  similar  to  a giraffe's head.  One witness   observed   small,   "incessantly 
fluffering"  ears  while  the   other   did  not notice the ears  but thought  that the animal had I small,  straight  horns  on its head, eight to ten inches high and the size of a small water pipe. A     mane the color  of seaweed was visible along the neck all  the  way down to the  body.  The body itself     was  about six feet across,  the   "size   of a steam boiler,"  although not rounded, with a ridge along the  back.<br>
<br>
About three feet of the body emerged above the  water  surface.  While the animal was in a  low  wave  trough  after  a  breaker  had  passed, one of the witnesses,  who  observed  a  tail  as  long  as  the rest  of  the  body,  estimated  the  total  length  of  the animal to be fifty-five feet.<br>
<br>
Are such stories true?  Have people seen sea     serpents  or merely  glimpsed  real and  elusive  animals  yet  unknown  to science?  Or are their reports akin to the sensational  offerings of tabloids?  Logic suggests three possibilities:<br>
<br>
(1) Witnesses were lying;<br>
<br>
(2)  they  were   honest   but   deluded;   or<br>
<br>
(3)     they actually observed what they described.<br>
<br>
The veracity of witnesses is not readily testable. Undoubtedly some hoaxes have been reported.<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, the surprise and disbelief expressed by many people at what they have seen, plus the reluctance of several individuals to speak of their experience for fear of being ridiculed, suggest that they might be telling the truth.  In some cases multiple witnesses have corroborated each other's descriptions.<br>
<br>
Many skeptics acknowledge that the observers have encountered some strange animal.  The interpretation of what witnesses saw is most often not accepted by scientists, who suspect some error of observation and are wary of jumping to conclusions on the basis of irreproducable evidence, and by laymen, who feel threatened by novelty.'Mus, a plethora of alternate explanations has come forward: 'What you must have seen is an oarfish," insists the dismissive critic.<br>
<br>
Others are equally sure that a pod of leaping dolphins or belugas were seen, or a leopard seal, a family of sea lions, a tangle of giant kelp, and so on.<br>
<br>
Most cases of misinterpretation tan be eliminated by admitting only the best evidence such as sightings at close range, under good conditions, by sober and (preferably) numerous witnesses who provide detailed and consistent information.  The eyewitness accounts
reported here are among the best.  None of the "monsters" is reconcilable with any known living marine creature, which indicates that perhaps witnesses saw a creature thought to be extinct.<br>
<br>
This possibility has gained respect since 1938 when Marjorie Courtenay Latimer identified a bluish, man-sized fish captured in the Indian Ocean off South Africa as a coelacanth, previously known only as a fossil fish with stubby, leg like fins, thought to be ancestral to land vertebrates." The last known living coelacanth had lived eighty million years ago! The prospect of discovering more "living fossils" has fired both public and scientific imaginations.<br>
<br>
Numerous marine crypted sightings have been explained in terms of extinct animals such as Staller's sea cow, a sluggish sirenian hunted to extinction by starving Russian fur traders soon after its scientific discovery in the Bering Sea in the eighteenth century; the zeuglodon, a serpentine, primitive whale known from shallow seas of the Miocene Period (twenty-five-million years ago); and long-necked plesiosaurs, marine reptiles from the Jurassic Period (more than sixty-five-million years ago)." Each of these hypotheses has its proponents, but none draws universal approval.<br>
<br>
The final possibility is, of course, that the animals observed are entirely new and unknown to science.  Most oceanographers readily concede that the ocean may yet have secrets to reveal.  New animals continue to be discovered, usually by accident.  For example, the megamouth shark, a fifteen-foot-long filter feeder, was found tangled in the anchor chain of a United States Navy ship near Hawaii in 1976. It had never been observed before, and only five other specimens have been seen since.<br>
<br>
What unknown animal hides in the coastal waters of the Pacific Northwest? A creature with a long neck, whiskers, a mane, and a large body with lumps on its back.  An animal that makes noises and hisses when it surfaces; by all appearances an air-breather and a mammal.  But why would a large air-breather be seen so rarely at the surface? Where would this unknown, presumed mammal, perhaps even Heuvelmans's hypothetical "merhorse," breed? Heuvelmans has attempted to classify marine crypteds according to their character-
istics and has hypothesized a variety of new animals to fit the observations.<br>
<br>
One of them is the "merhorse," a long-necked, horse-headed marine mammal with large eyes, whiskers, and a mane, similar to many of the observations of Caddy.  Seals and other pinnipeds congregate in gregarious rookeries; whales engage in musical frolics.  How could such a large, unknown marine mammal be so elusive?<br>
<br>
The mystery is not likely to be solved in the near future.  Sightings are rare and apparently random. The development and funding of a research program that embraces review of evidence, formulation of hypotheses, search strategy, and instrument design in
what is, after all, a legitimate scientific question tends to be thwarted by the stigma of "frivolity" that mars the subject, as well as by the absence of any obvious practical application.<br>
<br>
Crypto zoology, without a clear prospect for the betterment or enlightenment of humankind, remains a science that seems too "pure" for most oceanographers to pursue seriously.<br>

Marge Davenport, "Caddy, northwest sea serpent and other fishy stories, " <B>Afloat and Awash in the Old Northwest.</B> Tigard, Oregon: Paddlewheel Press, 1988, p. 201-208<br>
<br>
Loch Ness can have " Nessy, " its sea monster, the Northwest has its own sea serpent, witnessed in Northwest waters by at least 200 persons over a period of years!<br>
<br>
"Caddy," short for Cadborosaurus, is the name given the Northwest's widely discussed sea serpent which has been investigated by University of British Columbia oceanographers.<br>
<br>
First reports of the Northwest sea monster came from Indian legend.  Sightings persisted through the days of the great sailing ships and reports became more frequent in the 1930's and 1940's.<br>
In 1969, the UBC investigators compiled a report summarizing the history of "Caddy.  " Most of the sightings have been off Vancouver Island in the Pacific Ocean, or the island's bays.<br>
<br>
The first recorded observation of "Caddy" was September, 1905, during a big salmon run at the mouth of the Adams River in British
Columbia.  The fishermen said the creature's long brown neck and head broke the water.  It submerged and came up again about 100 yards from their boat.<br>
<br>
Then it disappeared.  They said the neck was six to eight feet and the head resembled a giraffe's head.  It had large eyes and on its head were two bumps, like small horns.  Needless to say, the creature terrified the fishermen and they forgot the salmon and made for shore.<br>
<br>
The next report recorded came from Neah Bay in Washington in the 1930's.  A 20-foot long animal with an eight foot neck and a horse-like head was sighted.<br>
<br>
In 1933, two respected historians - one an official of the British Columbia Provisional Library, and the other a clerk of the legislature - reported seeing an 80-foot monster that had thrust its great head and neck 10 feet out of the water near their boat before it swam away.<br>
<br>
The New York Times and the Illustrated Living News carried the news of this sighting as a front page banner with a full-page story.<br>
In 1934, two duck hunters gave a sworn statement that they had seen a large snake-like creature with a horse's head that had swallowed a downed duck that the hunters had shot.  Later, about 12 residents of South Pender saw the animal when about 12 feet of the body appeared above the water.<br>
<br>
By 1937 "Caddy" had headed south and was sighted at Yachats, Oregon.  The observers reported the same horse like head, long neck, and an estimated length of 55 feet.  In the spring of 1939, "Caddy" returned to British Columbia.  Two employees of the local telephone company watched as "Caddy" and a baby Caddy cavorted.  This time, as once before, reports said the animal made a cow-like bellow.  After a March 2 sighting the same year, observers said a huge eel like animal had been tossing seals into the air before devouring them.<br>
<br>
An organized hunt that spring sponsored by the Prince Rupert Chamber of Commerce turned up no additional sighting.<br>
Carcasses of sea animals resembling "Caddy" have washed up on West Coast shores.  The first one was at Henry Island, British Columbia, in November 1934.  It was reported to be about 35 feet long and serpent-like in shape.  In 1936, a 12-foot carcass with a goat-like head washed onto the beach at Aberdeen, Washington.  A Baltimore scientist at the scene said it looked like a reconstructed prehistoric animal.<br>
<br>
In 1947, a 40-foot skeleton was found near Vernon Bay, B.C. Parts of it were put on display in Alberni.  A sea-serpent was said to have washed up on a beach near DeLake in Oregon in 1950.  The body had a long tail, but it washed back out to sea before it was identified.<br>
<br>
Is "Caddy" a prehistoric creature that lives in the depths and infrequently appears along the shore?
The UBC researchers reached no conclusions.  They said eyewitness reporters suggest the possibility of three kinds of strange animals.<br>
<br>

<br>
Peter Ciams, "Colossal Claude and The Sea Monsters," <B>The Oregonian.</B> September 24, 1967.<br>
<br>
Until about 20 years ago Oregon also seemed to be wonderful country for serpent seekers. The following story by Peter Caims appeared in the September 24, 1967 edition of the Oregonian:<br>
<br>
Colossal Claude hasn't been seen for some time, but Marvin the Monster is reportedly alive and well.  He's even appeared on television.<br>
<br>
Claude was first seen cavorting near the mouth of the Columbia River in 1934.  Over the years he was often sighted by Columbia River lightship crewmen and by passing fishermen.  But the once-familiar sea serpent hasn't shown up since the mid-1950s-<br>
Marvin is a comparative newcomer.<br>
<br>
He was first discovered swimming off the Oregon Coast by Shell Oil Company divers in 1963.  His presence was recorded by video tape cameras, later screened for study by the nation's leading marine biologists.<br>
<br>
In addition to Claude and Marvin, the watery denizens have been sighted off Newport, Bandon, Nelscott, Waldport, Empire, Delake and also in Crescent and Crater Lakes.<br>
<br>
They come in several varieties and sizes.  Some are shiny and some have scales.  Some reportedly have coarse fur.  There is even a variety of mini-monster, for the compact minded.<br>
<br>
One thing they usually have in common is the shape of their heads.  Observers say they are most often found to be like those of the camel, or horse.<br>
<br>
L.A. Larson, mate of the Columbia River lightship, was probably the first to see Claude.  That was back in 1934.  Other members of the crew confirmed the sighting as did the captain and members of the crew of the lightship tender Rose.<br>
<br>
"It was about 40 feet long," and Larson.  "It had a neck some eight feet long a big round body, a mean looking tail and an evil, snaky look to its head."<br>
<br>
A news story of the day reported: "Members of the crew (of the
lightship) after studying the monster for some time with field glasses, wanted to lower a boat and go after it, but the officers discouraged the plan for fear it would swamp the boat."<br>
<br>
Claude next popped into the news in 1937, when skipper Charles E. Graham of the troller Viv raced back to Astoria with the story of sighting a "long, hairy, tan colored creature, with the head of an overgrown horse, about 40 feet long, and with a 4-foot waist measure."<br>
<br>
Veteran fishermen gazed out over the Columbia bar and said: "It's Claude.<br>
<br>
Claude was repeatedly sighted through the years that followed.  Once by Captain Chris Anderson of the schooner Arpo.  He said he got a face to face look at Claude.<br>
<br>
"His head was like a camel's," he said.  "His fur was coarse and gray.  He had glassy eyes and a bent snout that he used to push a 20-pound halibut off our lines and into his mouth."<br>
<br>
Other Oregon monsters that have competed for the headlines over the years include:<br>
<br>
Bandon's mini-monster, a 12 1/2 foot animal with a bulbous nose and a cow-like body covered with brownish hair.<br>
<br>
--a 30-foot serpent with "a slender neck, a snake-like head, and a fan-shaped tail" seen by more than 30 people at Nelscott.  The "thing" splashed around the Nelscott reefs on several occasions.  One group of observers was considered extremely reliable--its members were on a WCTU outing from the Willamette Valley.<br>
<br>
Proximity of Whiskey Run reef apparently had nothing to do with the sightings of a sea monster off Empire a few years ago.  Ben Tanner, skipper of the troller Gold Coast, said the creature approached his fishing boat, "smacked its mouth, rolled its long lashed eyes at the crew, then pointed its tail in the air and dived straight down."<br>
<br>
Oregon Indians, of course, believe there is a monster in just about every fair-sized pool of water in the state.  Their legends are full of such stories.<br>
<br>
There is a paleface corroboration, however, for monster sightings in both Crater and Crescent lakes.  The latter, in particular, is said to have an unusual inhabitant that has been sighted several times.<br>
<br>
One day Henry Schwering and Bert Vincent were fishing on the lake.  Henry later reported: "I suddenly noticed that the <B>fish </B>had stopped biting.  Then I noticed fish scooting away and the water started boiling.  Then I saw a huge, round head break water not far from the boat.  " The next day Bert also saw the "thing" himself, as did
others on the lake shore.<br>
<br>
Reports that a 22-foot hairy-chested monster had been washed up on the beach at Delake brought people hurrying to the spot on March 4, 1950.  What brought them running was Old Hairy (as locals quickly dubbed him.)<br>
<br>
"It had the body of a cow, approximately nine tails, and is covered with hair all over the body and legs," ran one enthusiastic account.<br>
<br>
Pretty teen-ager Marybell Allum of Delake was the first to stumble on Old Hairy.  Then her dad, town marshal Andy Allum, had a look.  He said the monster weighed all of 1,000 pounds.<br>
<br>
"It's a whale shark, undoubtedly," said Dr. E. W. Gudger, of the American Museum of Natural History.  "A harmless critter with the body shaped like a tadpole."<br>
<br>
"Whale blubber," said an Oregon Fish Commission biologist.<br>
<br>
"It's an elasmobranch," said Prof.  Fred J. Kohlruss of the University of Portland.  "It's a sea inhabitant whose bones remain in the cartillage stage."<br>
<br>
Despite all of this leaned thinking, the who and what of Old Hairy was never satisfactorily explained.<br>
<br>
And so it is with Marvin, Oregon's youngest monster.<br>
<br>
Marine biologists have examined the Shell Oil Co. video tapes, which show Marvin in detail.  The footage was shot during the company's search for off-shore oil.<br>
<br>
Marvin shows up as being about 15-feet long.  He has barnacled ridges along his body, and he propels himself in corkscrew fashion in waters about 180 feet in depth.<br>
<br>
The University of California believes Marvin is a etenaphor Oelly fish); Scripps Institute of Oceanography thinks he's a salpida: the University of Washington plumps for a siphonophore (another jelly fish,) the University of Texas believes simply that he is a creature left over from prehistoric times.<br>
<br>
But the fishermen hunched over their beer glasses in Astoria taverns know otherwise.  Misty-blue eyes strained seaward, with not a little affection, they say: "It's probably Claude."<br>

WALLOWA LAKE MONSTER<br>
<br>
Mike Helm, "The monster in Wallowa Lake," <B>Oregon's Ghosts and Monsters. </B> Eugene, Oregon: Rainy Day Press, 1983, p. 89-97.<br>
<br>
My father saw the monster in Wallowa Lake.<br>
<br>
He was a child at the time, fishing from the bank.  From his description, I've always pictured it as a huge snake with a head like a Chinese dragon, a regular medieval sea serpent, rippling across the surface of the lake, pausing momentarily to look at the little fisherman on the shore and then vanishing Serenely into the lake.<br>
<br>
Irene Wiggins saw it, too.<br>
<br>
"I've seen the darn thing a couple of times," said Mrs. Wiggins, who has owned the lodge at Wallowa Lake since 1945.  She was on horseback, on the moraine which forms the east side of Wallows Lake, when she saw it.  "Its head was a big, black thing, like a hog's head," she said, estimating its weight at loseveral hundred pounds".  The monster swam across the lake, away from her, bobbed up and down a few times, and then, near the far shore, disappeared.  "I wished I had a camera," she said.<br>
<br>
The story of the Wallowa Lake monster originated with the Nez Perce Indians, who roamed the northeastern corner of Oregon and much of what is now southeast Washington, Idaho, and Montana, and who made their summer home on the shores of WalIowa Lake before the white man arrived in Oregon.  George A. Waggoner heard one version of the story from Chief Joseph while passing through the Wallows country 
in the 1860s.  He included it in his book, <B>Sto</B><B>ries of Old Oregon, 
</B>published in 1905 by the Statesman Publishing Company in 1905 in Salem:<br>
<br>

A <B>Legend of Wallowa<br>

Lake.</B><br>
<br>
At Boise City I purchased a couple of mule teams of eight mules each, and proceeded on the way to Wallula for a load of freight.  As my mules had come across the plains that season, I concluded to stop in Grande Ronde Valley, where the grass was good, and let them recruit.<br>
<br>
I made camp about ten miles down the valley from where the old immigrant road enters it, and to employ the time, went elk hunting.  Three of us in the party, we rode about twenty miles north and camped on the mountain near Wallowa
Valley.  The next morning, near our camp, we met six Wallowa<br>
Indians going after a band of elk they had seen the evening before near our camp.  We accepted their invitation to go with them.<br>
<br>
One of them was a young chief named Joseph, afterwards to cause much trouble as the leader of an insurrection against the whites in 1878, and generally known as the Nez Perce War, although few Nez Perce Indians were in the outbreak.  Chief Joseph was quite an intelligent Indian, and was recognized then as a leader among his people.<br>
<br>
He said we must observe great caution in approaching the elk, and be sure to kill all we wanted first, for elk, when frightened, will 
travel ten or twelve miles before they stop, and then will keep pickets out behind and be on the lookout for several days.<br>
<br>
We kept under cover as much as possible, and approached cautiously until, emerging from a strip of timber, we were within thirty yards of the game we sought.  All unconscious of our presence, they were taking their ease, about forty of them.  Some were feeding, some were lying down, and one old fellow nearest us appeared to be asleep standing on his feet.  His eyes were closed and he lazily flapped his long ears to drive away the gnats that hummed about him.<br>
<br>
Joseph gave the signal by raising his rifle, and nine shots rang out almost as one report.  Four elk dropped in their tracks, and the rest, instead of running away, turned startled eyes upon us and stood still.  We had muzzle loading rifles and nine powder horns were raised at once for another charge of powder.  Before we were ready to fire again the herd started to run; As they plunged down the hill we gave them another volley.  When it was all over, we had thirteen fat elk for our morning's work.<br>
<br>
The Indians were delighted, and returned to their village for help to take care of the meat.  We prepared to dry or jerk some of it.  We drove four forked sticks in the ground, about ten feet apart in a square.  Across these we laid poles, and then smaller sticks on which to lay the meat, after it was cut in thin slices.  Under this scaffold we built a fire to keep the flies away and to assist the sun in drying the meat.<br>
<br>
We were several days thus occupied, and during this time I went with the Indians down the Wallowa Valley, a most beautiful one, lying along the south side of Wallowa Lake.  On the north of the lake the mountains rose several thousand feet, rather abruptly.  Joseph's village was an ideal one; it occupied the site on which now stands Enterprise City.<br>
<br>
While the Indians were taking care of -the elk killed, Chief Joseph was several times at our camp.  On one of these occasions he
related the following incident in the history of his people:<br>
<br>

"A long time ago," he said, "I don't know how long, but think it was as long as two men can live (meaning 260 years), our tribe was very strong, and we had many warriors, and went every summer out into the buffalo country to hunt.  Once our people met a band of Blackfeet warriors and had a great battle.  There were a great many Blackfeet, and we had only a few warriors.  Red Wolf was the chief, and he lost nearly all his braves.  There was great sorrow in the village when he returned almost alone and told what the Blackfeet had done.<br>
<br>
"All that winter our people made bows and arrows, and when the spring came, Red Wolf gathered all his warriors and went to fight the Blackfeet.  They did not go to the Blackfeet country, for that is a long way off, but found a large band of them in the buffalo country, and had a great battle.  Nearly all the Blackfeet were killed, and Red Wolf got 2000 horses and many scalps, and none of his warriors were killed.  When he came back home our people were glad, and danced many days.<br>
<br>
"Every year Red Wolf went to the buffalo country and fought the Blackfeet; sometimes we lost many warriors.  Red Wolf got old and died, but still our people fought every summer, and took many scalps.  Young Red Wolf, the old chief's son, led the warriors, and we were a great people.  Every boy went to the buffalo country as soon as he was big enough to fight.<br>
<br>
Once, when Young Red Wolf and a great many braves were out hunting buffalo, the Blackfeet came on them while they were all asleep and killed a great many and followed the rest.  Every day they fought, but the Blackfeet were so many, as many as the blades of grass on the hills.  When Red Wolf crossed the lake he had only a few braves and he could fight no more.  The Blackfeet camped on the other side of the lake, and built great fires and shouted and danced; but no fires were in our village, and the women wailed for our lost braves.<br>
<br>
"Red  Wolf  had  one  child,  a   daughter,   Wahluna.<br>
She was very sorry for  her  people  and  loved  her  father, who could fight no more, but said they would all be killed when the Blackfeet came around the lake.  At night, while they were all wailing for the dead, WahILna went down in the willows by the lake, and when everyone had gone away from the water, she got in her canoe and paddled across the lake to the camp of the Blackfeet.<br>
<br>
Her paddle made no sound, and they did not hear her until she stood by the fire and said: 11 am Wahluna, Red Chief Is child.  I want to
talk to the great chief of your people.'<br>
<br>
"Then the great chief said: 'What words has the daughter 6f Red Wolf to speak? My ears are open.' I'Wahluna said: 'Our warriors are nearly all gone, only a few are left, and our women and children are wailing for our dead.  It is dark in our village, and we have no fires, for we are afraid of the great chief of the Blackfeet.  Red Wolf says tomorrow all will die.<br>
<br>
"When you come you will only find old men and women and children; you can kill the old people and take the young girls and children for slaves; but an when you come to your own village your women d young girls cannot hear your warriors shout, for we will wail loud for our dead braves, and your women will wail with us, and there will be no joy in your village.  You have many scalps of our young warriors, and do not want the scalps of old men and women.  If you go to your own country and do not come to our village, then our fires can burn again.  We can never fight the great chief again, for our braves are all dead.<br>
<br>
"Then Wahluna laid her face in the sand, and did not move.  Then Tlesca, a young chief, the son of the great chief, laid his robe upon her shoulders and said: 'My heart is sore with yours, and i will not kill any more of your people.'<br>
<br>
"Then the great chief was angry and said: 'Her people are dogs.  Let the brave Chief Tlesca take his robe from her shoulders that she may die.'<br>
<br>
"But Tlesca said: 'The daughter of Red Wolf, who has fought our bravest warriors along the trail for a thousand miles, is not a dog.  For one whole moon he has fought our braves by day and by night.  He had nothing to eat, and his knees were weak; we could see him stagger when he ran; but when he turned to f ight for his people, his heart was great.  I am the only one of all our warriors who would fight him alone; my shoulder is broken by his war club.  My robe is on the maiden's shoulders; I will not take it away.  I have spoken.'<br>
<br>
"Tlesca was a great warrior, and the Great Chief loved him and said: 'The great warrior Tlesca has spoken and his words are good.  I will lay my robe on his.' Then Wahluna knew her people might live, and went back to her canoe.<br>
<br>
"When she took her paddle, Tlesca was standing there, and said: 'When twelve moons are passed Wahluna will listen in the middle of the night and she will hear a great owl down by the lake.  Come when you hear the owl and I will speak.'
"And Wahluna counted the moons, and when twelve were passed, she listened, when all in the village were asleep, and she heard the great owl down by the lake.  Then she put her robe on and went through the village.  Her feet made no sound, and no one saw her.  At the edge of the lake she found Tlesca. He said: 'The maidens of the Blackfeet are fair, and many look on Tlesca, for he is a great warrior; but his heart is with Wahluna, and he wants her for his wife.'<br>
<br>
"Wahluna said: 'My people would kill you, for their hearts are sore, for the wolves have gnawed the bones of their young men.'<br>
"Tlesca said: 'When six moons have passed, Wahluna will listen in the middle of the night, when all are asleep, and she will hear a grey wolf across the lake.  Let Wahluna come, and Tlesca will speak.'<br>
<br>
"Wahluna counted the moons, and when six were gone and all were asleep in the middle of the night, she heard the grey wolf across the lake.  Then she took her canoe and went across the lake and found Tlesca.  He said: 'When the sun is over the great mountain I will come to the Red Wolf's village with my father, the Great Chief of the Blackfeet, and all our chiefs and many great warriors, and we will smoke the peace pipe together, and the Blackfeet and Red Wolf's people will be brothers, and Red Wolf can come to hunt the buffalo, and we will catch fish<br>
from your lake.'<br>
<br>
Wahluna went back to the village and told her father that when the sun was over the great mountain the Great Chief and his warriors would come and smoke the pipe of peace with the Wallowas.  When the Blackfeet came, they smoked together and were brothers.  The Great Chief said: 'Tlesca is a great warrior, and his heart is with Wahluna, and he wants her for his wife.'<br>
<br>
"Red Wolf sent runners to all his friends, the Nez Perces, the Kiyouses, and the Yakimas, and they came, and there was a great wedding, and Wahluna said she would sit in Tiescals lodge.  The young men bought deer, bear, and elk from the mountains, and the girls caught fish in the lakes, and they had a great feast, and all were very happy.<br>
<br>
"Tlesca and Wahluna got into a canoe, when the sun went down, and went out on the lake, for it was very fair to look at.  All the people stood on the shore and watched their canoe.  Then they saw a great serpent come out of the water, and the canoe was turned over, and Tlesca and Wahluna were never seen again.<br>
<br>
"Then the Blackfeet went back to their country and said the Great
Spirit was angry because they had made peace with Red Wolf and his people."<br>
<br>
After a few moments, I asked the young chief if t,he story was a true one, or just a story told to please the children.<br>
<br>
"O," he said, "it is all true; I have heard my people tell it many times, and have heard some of the Blackfeet warriors tell it, too."<br>
<br>
"But," I asked, "do you believe that a great snake came and swallowed Tlesca and Wahluna?<br>
<br>
"No," he answered, "one big wind, one big wave; that's all."<br>
<br>
A fisherman from Walla Walla, now dead, told Mrs. Wiggins that the monster, as long as a rowboat, surfaced right near his boat.  "He probably got the best look at it," she said.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Wiggins believes that the monster is still in the lake.  "I'll swear there's a big one in there," she said.  "You can see it when the lake's quiet and the light's right."<br>
<br>
According to a story published in The Oregonian in 1950, Mr. and Mrs. H. C. Wicklander, of Joseph, and Joe Tatone, of Portland, saw two creatures, one about 16 feet long," and the other about eight feet long, feeding on bluebacks at the head of the Lake.<br>
<br>
"Sideways it (the largest of the pair) presented the outline of a great trout or perhaps a shark, but rather blunt-nosed and with no dorsal fin visible.  The head-on view of the thing gave the impression of a wide buffalo head, perhaps two feet across with eyes about 14 inches apart"<br>
<br>
In the same article, Mr. and Mrs. Bob Reesey residents of Wallowa<br>
County, reported having seen a similar "monster fish" in 1932, from their boat, about 300 feet from the west shore.  "Near what seemed the bottom they saw a great fish as long or longer than<br>
their 11-foot boat.  They crossed and recrossed the monster, which seemed not to be bothered by them."<br>
<br>
Wallowa Lake is home to other legends, too.  When we were children we were told that the lake is bottomless, and that it is connected to the Great Lakes by a subterranean river.<br>
<br>
An article published in 1951 in the Wallowa County Chieftain stated, "The lake yields up none of its drowning victims, who pre-
sumably are carried away by this strange creature who lurks hundreds of feet below the surface." My sisters told me of a fisherman who drowned in Wallowa Lake.  His body washed up on the shore of Lake Erie.

Howard McKinley Corning, "Indian Slavery," <B>Dictionary of Oregon History.</B> Portland: Binfords and Mort, 1956, p. 266.<br>
<br>
In the years prior to white settlement slavery was prevalent among Oregon tribes and was largely the result of war and not a cause. The Shastas and the Klamaths, continually at war, enslaved all women and children captured in raids against each other, and although tribal braves were sometimes enslaved, the practice was not common due to the difficulty of retaining them in captivity.<br>
<br>
Slaves taken in raids or battle by southern tribes were bought by northern tribes; a horse, six beaver skins or two blankets were common payment for a slave.<br>
<br>
Although wars and incursions were the most usual mode of making slaves, these were not the only causes; Indians sometimes gambled away the parts of their anatomy until they put their whole body in bondage to another tribe or camp for a specified time or in some extreme cases for life.<br>
<br>
Slaves among the Indians usually received very cruel treatment, poor food and miserable quarters. They did most menial tasks and when sick received no treatment whatsoever, but were lift to die.<br>

<br>
Marian Smith, "Slavery," <B>The Puyallup-Nisqually.</B> New York: AMS Press, 1940 p. 52-53.<br>
<br>
With slavery is introduced a category more nearly approaching a true social class.  Slaves were captured during raids upon strange groups.  Adult men were never taken.  The choice fell upon children in their teens, old enough to take care of themselves and likely to fit more readily into their new social role.<br>
<br>
After slaves were once fitted into the new family group 1 they made no attempt to run away.  They were in the position of individuals whose old ties had been irremediably broken and they had, perforce, to take up new affiliations.  So long as he remained within the family group a pleasant and industrious slave was as well off in his daily contacts as any other member.<br>

He was called and had the right to call others by regular terms indicative of family ties, grandchild, nephew, and their reciprocals, and friend, according to relative age.  The term "slave", stadak, was used only as a reproach, an action which recalled to the slave's mind his social status and was, consequently, regarded as unkind.<br>
<br>
The one great difference in their status lay in the fact that slaves were outside the social struggle for prestige.  They could be respected as individuals but they could not translate that respect into influence over other members of the society.  Their word was forever without authority.<br>
<br>
Status belonged to adults only.  Class names were not applied from their early years of traits by which their future might be prophesied, marriage was the first step in their career.  Every effort was made, therefore, to marry a child well, a fit mate being always considered in terms both of family connections and personal promise.<br>
<br>
Until individuals had established their own right to status they might be referred to as "born of high class", "born of nothing" or "born of a slave".  The cards were stacked in favor of the child of high class parents, but every child with ambition so regarded himself and he looked about for other means of promotion if he had no important family connections.<br>
<br>
The only child really at a disadvantage was the child of a slave.  He was not himself a slave, yet he was always open to insult.  If he had no ambitions no one bothered to apply the insult.  On the other hand, if he spoke with authority and assumed a right to do so, the insult could be applied-at the risk of open enmity as an invitation to conflict which was fought on the same basis as any other struggle for prestige.<br>
<br>
If two men with the same degree of individual prestige spoke contrary to each other, the fact that one was related in the direct line to a slave would be sufficient to have the advice of the other accepted.  In such cases "his mother married a slave" was an equal blemish on his name and, although like most open criticisms it would remain unspoken, it would suffice to turn public opinion.'<br>
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br>
<br>
     I Slaves did the routine and heavy work, work which would otherwise have fallen upon some member of the family.  But they were additional persons to be fed and clothed, any inadequacy in either reflecting directly against their owner.  Children received no training in special skills but they were not ill treated.  It was possible for relatives to buy a slave back but no information could be gathered on the procedure.  Although one of the four slaves remembered had come of a wealthy Snohomish family, no attempt had been made to redeem him.  Slaves could be gambled or sold but here, again, no instances were known.  In each of the four
cases they had been fitted as new members into the family group.  Female slaves frequently had children by their masters, in which case they became permanent members of the family and were never gambled nor sold.  "In his heart she was no longer a slave."<br>
<br>
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br>
<br>
The genealogical memory of the Puyallup-Nisqually covered only four generations and slavery, which formed the only real blotch- on the family tree, seems to have been relatively scarce.  The whole attitude toward slavery, however, tended to conceal it.  Even today accusations of slave ancestry are never made of Irving persons nor of persons with Irving descendants.<br>
<br>
One informant admitted freely that his grandfather, who later became village leader because of his personal characteristics, "was captured when he was young by the Lummi, maybe it was the Tulalip.  Anyway he got away and finally got home.  That shows how good he was.  Some people around used to say when he was old, 'don't listen to him: he's a slave."'<br>
<br>
This same man was described as noble by other informants for he was undisputed leader of his village.  The case brings out clearly the distinction between individual prestige and authority backed by both talent and family which came to light only upon occasions of competition.<br>

<br>
This existed all over the Sound, most of the slaves having been taken in war.  When the treaties were made, one article stipulated that this should be abolished, and hence there has been very little of it since I have lived among the Indians.  One Twana had three slaves twenty years ago, who remained with him because they preferred to do so, and were treated about as any other person would have been.<br>
<br>
One was a girl, and the old folks apparently thought as much of her as they would have done had she been their own child.  It was, indeed, a common remark that she ruled them.  Twelve or fourteen years ago two left, and have since been married, and the other
stayed with his master until he died about four years ago when he was about sixty years old.<br>
<br>
Dr. Gibbs says that some of the Indians told Col.  M. T Simmons that the first slave was made as follows: at a feast a man criticized the cooking; the Indians deemed it an insult, and deliberated on a punishment; some wished to kill him, but it was decided to make him a slave, so that he might always serve the man whom he had insulted.  He also added that the people were often made slaves when they were unable to pay their debts.<br>
<br>
Dr. Gibbs also says that in 1855 they probably constituted one tenth of the population, and the system was the cause of much trouble among them, both in trying to procure more, and in attempting to recover those who had escaped.<br>
<br>
When a master died, a part at least of his slaves were killed.  The children of slaves were always disgraced, even if they were half free.  Even within six years one girl was refused as the wife of a man, because some of his relations remembered that some of her ancestors were slaves.<br>

Verne F. Ray, "Lower Chinook Ethnographic Notes," <B>University of Washington Publications in Anthropology.</B> VII (May, 1938), p.51-54.<br>
<br>
Slaves were held by the Chinook in considerable numbers and played a large role in the economic life.  To them fell most of the laborious and disagreeable work though they often worked side by side with their masters.  Emma Luscier said that there was no distinction in general type of work but that the most difficult tasks in oyster gathering, wood cutting and fishing were assigned to slaves.<br>
<br>
Thompson states that "they appeared as well off as their masters, except their paddling the canoes, and hauling in the seine nets, in all which their masters take a share of the labor. Concomly is pictured by Henry as sitting idly in the middle of his canoe while the slaves around him paddled, but then he was always fond of ostentation, especially when visiting the whites.<br>
<br>
Ross speaks of each free woman as having two, three, or more slaves in constant attendance, thus relieving her of all drudgery.  He adds that in trading activities a woman was commonly followed by a "train of slaves." ' 
Mrs. Luscier estimated that the average upperclassman owned two or three slaves, with chiefs possessing perhaps double that number, or even more in exceptional cases.  Concomly owned ten or twelve slaves; this may represent a customary maximum.  Commoners were permitted to hold slaves as well as their social superiors but of course it was seldom that a lower class man possessed more than one or two.<br>
<br>
Most slaves were obtained by purchase from surrounding peoples.  It is uncertain from what direction came most of the slaves so acquired.  Apparently the Puget Sound region and the Willamette river valley in Oregon were particularly well represented.  Both Swan and Mrs. Luscier emphasized a general northern source.<br>
<br>
Slaves were an important item in trade, representing the maximum of unit value.  There is no doubt that the Chinook not only possessed more slaves per capita than any surrounding people, but that their eminence as traders was largely responsible.  Ross' statement that slaves were regularly bought and sold m the manner of any other article of trade was substantiated by my informants.<br>
<br>
That is, slaves were not only purchased when manual assistance was needed but often merely as a "good bargain" or as a stable unit of value.  In recent times the price of a slave varied between one and five hundred dollars or sometimes more.<br>
<br>
"Not infrequently a valuable canoe is added to the bargain."" A young female slave from Nisqually was purchased by qe-'walaptc about 1875 for two hundred dollars plus a considerable amount of property.  The possession of a slave or slaves thus enabled one to meet any economic emergency.  They might serve as payment of bride price, payment of blood-money, or might be exchanged for goods with which to give a great feast.<br>
<br>
Second in importance as a source of slaves was raiding.  One Lower Chinook village never raided another; all such activities were directed toward "outside" groups.  Here the evidence as to locale is a little more specific.  The Chinook, Mrs. Bertrand said, took slaves from the Quinault "whenever they felt like it." This exaggerated statement is nevertheless instructive.<br>
<br>
According to Kane, slaves usually were procured from the Umpqua river (Oregon) region where they were "sometimes seized by war parties, but the children are often bought from their own people. Thompson is less definite: "These people had many slaves, they were prisoners taken in their marauding expeditions along the seashore, most of them youths when taken."<br>
<br>
When encounters occurred with foreign groups slaves were invariably
taken, if possible.  Thus the sources of slaves secured by force would also indicate the directions in which offensive warfare was waged.  On the defensive side, the Chinook seemed to fear most the Quilleute.<br>
<br>
The latter sometimes were led in their travels by Chinook slaves taken many years before, since the dangerous sand bars of the Columbia river and Willapa Bay rendered an experienced guide almost indispensable.  In slave raids an attempt was always made to take captives of twelve years of age or less.  No effort was ever made to enslave adult men, though women were occasionally carried away.<br>
<br>
There existed several minor sources of slavery.  Inability to pay debts or blood money led to temporary, or sometimes permanent, slavery of debtor to debtor.  The murderer of a chief [upperclassman] automatically became a slave, according to Mrs. Bertrand.  Blood-money in such a case was never accepted [a sufficient amount rarely being available?].<br>
<br>
A desperate gambler sometimes wagered his own body, beginning with hands, then limbs, and finally head, and with its loss came slavery.  Sometimes a specified number of years was involved after which the person regained his former status."'<br>
<br>
In other cases a quantity of goods was named which should be considered the equivalent; if, then, by a lucky chance at gambling or through the aid of his friends the enslaved man was able to amass that amount he might immediately gain his freedom.<br>
<br>
Enslavement because of inability to pay blood money seems to have been not uncommon.  In such a case the chief called the persons involved before a gathering of villagers, where the defaulter was assigned to the complainant, and was publicly called "slave." In common with all slaves, such a person might later buy his freedom.  Or some times the enslavement was for a stated number of years only.<br>
<br>
A final source of slavery was the marriage of an upperclassman to a slave.  Such an act degraded the freeman to the status of slave and all of the offspring of the union likewise.<br>
<br>
Local orphans were sometimes seized by chiefs and sold as slaves, but always to some outside group.  A <B>man</B> facing inability to pay blood-money often did likewise if an orphaned child were available among his relatives.  Such action frequently caused deep resentment on the part of other persons and may have led to feuds.<br>
<br>
This practice extended to the Kalapuya.  A Kalapuya slave at Bay Center had reached there in such fashion.  A Kalapuya shaman had been accused of witchcraft by the doctor attending a patient supposedly the former's victim.  
In order to satisfy the claim of the relatives of the deceased the accused shaman seized an orphaned niece and turned her over as a slave.  The girl was twelve years old at the time.  The recipients sold her and after several exchanges she reached qwatsalmts.  Her owner died some time later, leaving her free.  She married a white man and moved to Bay Center before she died.<br>
<br>
She carried a great resentment for her uncle to the time of her death.  At that time she was known as xo xo (old) Maggie; formerly she had been known by the slave name, kalapu'da.<br>
<br>
This introduces two new points, freedom for slaves upon the death of masters, and distinctive slave names.  With regard to the former, a number of specific examples were furnished by informant s but it would be dangerous to generalize from these because all relate to a time when Chinook culture was rapidly being eradicated by white encroachment.<br>
<br>
It is certain that a master had the privilege of freeing a slave at any time that he pleased, but it is almost equally certain that this was rarely done.<br>
<br>
Quite to the contrary, slaves often were killed at the time of the master's death.  This was especially true if the deceased were a chief; seldom more than one slave was killed, however, regardless of the number owned.  A slave purchased as a companion for a child was almost certain to be killed if the child died.  In this-case both bodies were placed in the same burial canoe.<br>
<br>
Parker relates that "the wife of Calpo, a very influential chief of the Chinook village near Cape Disappointment, on losing a daughter in the year 1829, killed two female slaves to attend her to the world of spirits, and for the particular purpose of rowing her canoe to the far off happy regions of the south."<br>
<br>
Gibbs states that slaves were starved to death when their masters died, and more specifically, that Toke attempted in 1853 to lull a slave after his daughter's death, in pursuance of the girl's request.<br>
<br>
Slaves were characteristically named after the group or locality of their nativity. Both men and women were subject to such designation, but sex identifying suffixes were used.  Naming according to this pattern was not invariable practice; owners followed their own desires.<br>
<br>
On the whole, slaves seem to have been well treated.  As stated above, they worked together with their masters.  Also they lived in the same quarters and shared very much the same food, though they ate separately.  Their opinions were often sought; their ridicule
was deeply felt."<br>
<br>
The fact that they dared ridicule freemen is significant in itself.  Ambitious and enterprising slaves were rewarded by being placed in charge of others.  There was even one way by which a slave might gain freedom (in addition to the seldom achieved purchase of liberty).  This was through the acquisition of shamanistic power.<br>
<br>
Such an accomplishment removed the formal stigma but the person might even afterward be taunted with the name.  All slaves were allowed to seek guardian spats and some met with marked success.  Owners purchased mates for slaves reaching marriageable age.<br>
<br>
Franchere states that slaves were treated with humanity while their services were useful, but as soon as they became incapable of labor, they were neglected and allowed to perish of want, whereupon their bodies were thrown without ceremony under the stump of an old decayed tree or dragged into the woods and left.' "<br>
<br>
Kane decries the position of the slave, emphasizing the "power of life and death at pleasure" of the master but he was little acquainted with Lower Chinook life.  Slaves were sometimes bet in gambling but there was an equal chance in an exchange of masters that it would be to the slave's advantage.<br>
<br>
As an example of especially ill treatment Mrs. Luscier told of a female slave from Puget Sound named nu'tc who was owned by m(zte'll at OysterviUe.  The latter not only worked the slave long and hard, even though she was very old, but beat her and threw ashes in her farce when annoyed.<br>
<br>
The punishment for a runaway slave was to have his ears cut off.  If the fugitive reached his home people, seldom or never was an attempt made to bring him back.  But successful escapes were rare and when the return occurred after several years there was a high probability that no welcome would be forthcoming.  Most groups from which slaves were taken, themselves kept slaves; thus the stigma remained, even at home.  When it was feared that a slave might run away, he was usually sold.<br>

Edward S. Curtis, "Slavery," <B>The North American Indian.</B> Curtis, 1913. Volume IX p. 74-75.
Slavery was firmly established  among  the  coast  Salish.  But   the harrowing  pictures  which  that  word  brings  before   our   mind  have little connection with the institution as it existed among the Indians of this region.  Slaves were captives taken in war and traded from tribe to tribe, and a most always the Prisoners were women or children.<br>
<br>
They wielded paddle's in their masters' canoes, fished, gathered wood, cooked, and made baskets and other utensils, but they labored no more strenuously than the free members of the lower class, and in return they were well treated' as members of the household.  It was not unusual for them to join their masters in the gambling games.<br>
<br>
As concerns his labor the slave was no great asset, and the principal reason for the existence of the institution of slavery was that the possession of these captives reflected honor and dignity upon their owners.  A chief's influence was in direct proportion to the number of his slaves.<br>
<br>
A male and a female Slave owned in the same family were permitted to marry, and their offspring were slaves.  Women of this class bore many illegitimate children, WhO Of course took the status of their mothers.  Among the Cowlitz, the bands at Shoalwater bay, the Quinault, and the Cowichan, slave women not infrequently married native-born men, even men of rank, and ceased then to be slaves, and in the first two groups the heads of all children born in slavery were flattened.<br>
<br>
On Puget sound and adjacent waters westward and northward, when a slave woman bore children by her master, although he accorded her and them the same treatment his other wives and children received, nevertheless a certain disgrace attached to these half-slave children and to their offspring so long as the blood taint could well be traced, for the descendant of a slave would be twitted with the fact of his base on whenever he fell into a dispute.<br>
<br>
In the same region also slave children were not permitted to have e head flattened.  In general it may be said that slaves were very well treated.  Instances of cruelty, such as slaying a captive at the funeral of a favorite child, were sporadic, and cannot fairly be charged against the institution itself.<br>
<br>
Few families of the common people held slaves, but many a chief possessed as many as ten.  Tok, chief in the middle of the nineteenth century of a village on the north side of Shoalwater bay, had twelve slaves, and, which is more noteworthy, only one wife.  Generally about one-tenth of the population were bondmen.<br>
<br>
The slaves of the Cowlitz were obtained by the barter of canoes at the annual native gathering at the Dalles of the Columbia, or at
Fort Vancouver, and were usually Kalapuya from Willamette river in Oregon, or Klamath and Shasta from southwestern Oregon and northern California.<br>
<br>
The Kalapuya slaves were mostly children sold by their parents, but the Klamath and Shasta slaves were bought from the Walamt (Willamette) and the Klackamas, who had purchased captives of one tribe from warriors of the other, the Klamath and the Shasta being constantly engaged in raids against each other.  From the Cowlitz some of these Oregon and California captives passed northward into the hands of the Puget Sound tribes.<br>
<br>
Prisoners taken by the Quilliute from the Makah were traded to the Hoh, whence they passed successively, ever southward, to the Queets, Quinault, Humtulips, Hoquiam, and finally the bands of Shoalwater bay, and a few even came into the possession of the Chinook.<br>
<br>
The Clallam, Sooke, Songish, Sanetch, and Cowichan organized frequent raids against the Skagit, Snohomish, and the tribes of Puget sound, who of course retaliated in kind.  The Cowichan of Vancouver island also made slaves on the west coast of the island and among the Lekwiltok, and, occasionally, the Clallam.<br>

<br>
Slaves were an important item of wealth of the Tsimshian and the possession of them added to the prestige of their owners.  Since there was no leisure class entirely dependent upon another class for support, slavery was not of fundamental economic importance to the northwest coast tribes.  While slaves did add to the wealth of their masters through their labor, the keeping of them for what they could produce was not a well developed concept.<br>
<br>
All the members of a household shared in the necessary labor involved in providing for themselves and for the household head and tribal chief.  In this labor the slaves and even the chiefs took part.  Slaves were often assigned to the more monotonous and menial tasks, but as often they and their masters worked side by side.<br>
<br>
There are two different aspects to slavery among the northwest coast tribes.  On the one hand slaves, from the southern tribes mainly, were bought, sold and given away at potlatches as property and
regarded as copper shields or any other wealth.  Slaves reached the Tsimshian from as far south as Puget Sound, though the larger number were from Vancouver Island and the mainland opposite the Island.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, the Tsimshian captured members of their own and neighboring tribes for the express purpose of holding them for ransom or to avenge an insult or injury.  To capture a member of a wealthy or influential lineage was to inflict a deeply resented injury on that kinship group and to have a member of one's own lineage so captured was a disgrace that must speedily be removed.<br>
<br>
Thus the Bella Bella captured a chiefs mother and tortured her in revenge for the same treatment accorded their chief's son, and to humiliate not only the chief but his whole tribe.  They also knew that they would receive a handsome reward for her return.<br>
<br>
Sqa-gwe-t, Gttancb' chief, once used the humiliation of slavery to humble <B>a</B> rich and powerful lineage in his tribe, a lineage of which he was jealous.  He approached the head of the house and asked for one of the women in marriage.  His request was granted, but as soon as he was married he sold his wife as a slave to <B>a</B> Stikine (Tlingit) chief.<br>
<br>
Her relatives redeemed her and again Sqa-pwe-t asked for her in marriage.  Her maternal uncles dared not refuse the chief's request and again she was sold as a slave.  Her lineage relatives redeemed her a second time.  Sqagwe-t again sent word that he wanted her for his wife.  Before she went to her husband the third. time her uncles gave a feast and announced that, so far as they were concerned, she was now dead.<br>
<br>
Should she again be sold into slavery they would not redeem her, nor would they ever use her name.  Sqa-gwe-t sold her the third time and she never returned to her own people.  Neither have they used her name since her enslavement.  The chief was successful in impoverishing and humiliating her family, since he forced them to use all of their accumulated wealth to pay for the woman's release from slavery and then left them with a permanent stigma of slavery on the family record.<br>
<br>
That slaves were not bought or captured primarily for their productive labor is attested by the frequent accounts of adoption of the children of captive women and by the marriages of such women, when of high rank, to men in the tribe.  A man now living at Metlakatla is the son of a Tlingit woman who was captured by the Tsimshian and who became the chief's wife.<br>
<br>
While the woman lost her captive status by this marriage, her son is still spoken of as of slave origin.  A captured person must be redeemed by his family and then must have had a potlatch given for him before the stigma can be entirely removed.  Even then village gossip win recall the fact of slavery to mind, especially if the one
descended from a captive attains any wealth or aspires to an influential position in the village.<br>
<br>
Slaves or captives were allowed no participation in the social life of the captors.  They could own no wealth, but were themselves wealth, to be disposed of as their masters wished.  Reports of the killing of slaves at a potlatch are not rare.  Sometimes the body of a slave was placed in the hole before a totem pole or house post was erected and one was sometimes killed to honor an initiate acquiring a supernatural power.  There are also accounts of kindly treatment of slaves.<br>
<br>
Dzi'basa had favorite slaves who were his constant companions, and Nias-nawa freed a woman slave to honor his daughter when she received a new name.<br>
<br>
Slaves were sometimes granted privileges by their masters.  Thus a slave man in the house of Ale-'m-laxha' was allowed to attend potlatches.  At any one given by a member of his master's tribe he had the privilege of lauding the person who was taking a new name by calling out, "Dear man, dear man, go ahead, go ahead, you will be foremost among the tribes." For this the host gave him a small gift.<br>
<br>
This man and his slave wife were well liked in the village, and, when the missionaries forced the Tsirnshian to free their captives, this couple stayed in the household of  their former master . Ale-'maxha' had a son by his slave woman whom he adopted as his nephew and who was raised by his sister as her son.<br>
<br>
Tsimshian men seldom married slave women from the south, since the latter lacked all clan affiliations and their children were outside the social structure.  Children by slave women had to be adopted ff they were to be absorbed into the tribe; otherwise they remained slaves.  Dzilbasa, Gttxala chief, had the largest number of slaves from the southern tribes and the various men holding the name were reported to have married their slave women, though there are stories of marriages the captives from the other Tsimshian tribes and with those from the Haida and Ingit.<br>
<br>
In such cases the children took the clan affiliation of their mothers.<br>
<br>
Slaves were not distinguished by dress from members of the tribe.  Those coming from the south were usually recognizable by their different physical appearance, particularly flattened heads.  The Ntsqa once made the error of mistaking a chief's daughter for a slave woman because she was plainly dressed.<br>
<br>
Wi-se-ks' daughter was sent to the Ntsqa village to purchase food. During the bargaining the Ntsqa became angry and threw refuse from
the salmon kettle on her.  Her father was so angry that he chased them up the Nass River, killing many before they escaped.  Since then, so the story goes, the Ntsqa address strange Tsimshian men as chiefs and women as princesses, in order to avoid a petition of their error.<br>
<br>
The different Tsimshian tribes were often involved in raids on each others villages .Often captives were taken and held until redeemed by their relatives.  If the lineage was too poor to pay for the captives return and too weak to recapture them by force, they became slaves, Halmas is said have bought a number of Tsimshian captives from the Tlingit and returned them their lineage relatives, receiving compensation for each.<br>
<br>
In the following account We-s received a number of his captive fellow tribesmen from a Haida chief in return for a favor.  Those who were not redeemed by their clan relatives continued live in his house as slaves.<br>
<br>
One day two half-starved young men came into the camp where We-s was living.  He learned that they were the nephews of the Haida chief from Skidegate and that they had escaped from a Gttxala raiding party.  We-s was a Gttxala, but he helped the young men return to their village.<br>
<br>
The next year the Haida chief gathered together a war party and set out to avenge himself for the wrongs done him.  The party surprised the village of the and too many captives, among them members of the chiefs' families and many prominent people.  On their way home the Haida stopped at the village where We-s was living and the Haida chief said to him, "For the aid you ave my nephews I want you to choose from among these captives the ones who are your own lineage relatives.  " We-s then took all the members of the chiefs' families  as his relatives.<br>
<br>
When he was through the Haida had only few captives left.<br>
<br>
The captives given to <B>We-s </B>by the Haida chief, with the exception of his own clan relatives, became his property, even though they were his own tribesmen.  He released his clan relatives though all of those not of his own house or lineage gave him gifts for saving them from slavery.<br>
<br>
No one would keep a captive or buy a slave belonging to his own clan, except to liberate him.  Clansmen of a captured<br>
person often aided him in  regaining  his  freedom.  The captives   received by We-s  were ransomed by relatives with the exception of two.  Later We-s built a new dwelling and named two house posts for the captives left in his hands, to let everyone know that these two names were still in his possession, and that the owners could not use them until he had been compensated.<br>

Just as the Haida chief in effect freed the clan relatives of We-s by turning them over to him so slaves were sometimes given their freedom as a mark of favor or to honor some relative. Freeing a slave at a potlatch was not often done for the slave's benefit, but was comparable to destroying property.<br>
<br>
Debt slavery or bondage for the payment of debts seems to have been rare but not unknown.  The more usual way of collecting a debt was to ridicule the debtor but at a potlatch or to seize property belonging to him or his lineage. Thus there are accounts of seizure of land rights, names and privileges to settle unpaid debts. Capture of a member of the offending lineage was also resorted to.<br>
<br>
According to informants slavery was abolished much later among the Gttxala than among the Tsimshian living at Old Metlakatla and Port Simpson, due to earlier and more thorough missionization of the mainland, natives. one informant whose father was a Gttxala and who spent his boyhood there, reported that Dzi'basa had many slaves in his household at that time, when they had been freed in the other two villages.<br>
<br>
The liberation Of slaves did not seriously disrupt Tsirnshian economy or social Structure.  The chief damage was done when potlatches were prohibited and with them the incentive for the accumulation of all kinds of property, of which slaves were only one item.<br>

<br>
At the other extreme of society, slaves did not have the rights even over their own bodies, since they were articles of property, chattels bought and sold (Ross 1849: 92; Swan 1857:166), cast off into a makeshift grave or into the water when dead (Franchere in Thwaites 1904-1907, 6:324; Ross 1849:97; Henry in Coues 1897, 2:825-826), and destroyed at a burial of the owner (Bishop 1967:127; Parker 1838:245; Lee and Frost 1844:233; Wilkes 1845, 5: 118; Gibbs
1877:189, 204; Minto 1900:300; Curtis 1907-1930, 8:89), like any other property.<br>
<br>
While it has been reported that slaves were well treated in the household (Lewis and Clark in Thwaites 1904-1905, 4: 120-121; Franchere in Thwaites 1904-1907, 6:324), to them fell the heaviest work, the division of labor being the usual one according to sex.<br>
<br>
They could be punished for attempting to escape.  Their lowermost position in society made their ridicule keenly felt; it was the worst loss of face to be made fun of by the slaves or be publicly called 'slave" (Franchere in Thwaites 1904-1907, 6:325; Ray 1938:53; Jacobs 1958-1959:528).<br>
<br>
The slaves, in distinction to all others, did not have their heads flattened from birth (Ross 1849:99; Lee and Frost 1844:102; Swan 1857:168), symbolizing an inherited status as alien.<br>
<br>
The majority of slaves were obtained by multiple sale or trade from the north down the tributaries of the Columbia and also along the coast to Willapa Bay (Seouler 1905:196; Swan 1857:166-167), and from far south (Lewis and Clark in Thwaites 1904-1905, 4: 120-121; Lee and Frost 1844:103; Kane 1857:20; Gibbs 1877:188-189), though Bishop in 1795 (1967:127) records a Chinook slave-gathering expedition of some six years previous, to what seems to be southern interior Oregon.<br>
<br>
Slave raiding increased during the maritime fur trade period.  Toward the mid-nineteenth century, it appears that the Oregon settlers in the Willamette Valley regularly bought slaves from the Chinookans and kept them for farm work (Lee and Frost 1844:133; Wilkes 1845, 4:348).<br>
<br>
Among the Chinookans themselves, in the early period, display of slaves paddling canoes (obvious from their round head) is noted by Casino, chief of the Multnomah who displayed six; Coalpo, who displayed eight, and Concomly, who outdid them all with 12 (Coues 1897, 2: 797, 794, 838), which was far above the average nobleman's two or three.<br>

<br>
The work <B>of Her Majesty's Ships</B> in British Columbia waters ex-
tended to certain social questions that played on the Victorian conscience-slavery and liquor.  Neither the anti-slavery patrol
nor prohibition enforcement was easy work, for Indian slave owners and sellers and liquor vendors and producers were difficult to locate and even harder to stop.  The gradual abolition of slavery was achieved by stopping intertribal marauding, but controlling the liquor traffic proved beyond the power of gunboats already taxed by other duties.<br>
<br>
For thousands of years slaves had been an integral part of Northwest Coast Indian life, ideology, and mythology.  Slaves were of high economic and prestige value to their owners.  The Tsimshian, for instance, used non-Tsimshian slaves captured in battle for gathering and canoeing.  In most if not all tribes, slaves were valuable items of property, but they themselves were outcasts (their heads sometimes shaved to identify them) and subject to their owner's disposal.<br>
<br>
Slaves were acquired by raiding parties or by purchase, and certain tribes-the Chinook, the Makah Nootka, the Newitty Kwakiutl, and the Tsimshian-were well-known slave traders.  At various places, particularly The Dalles on the Columbia River and Port Simpson, slaves were bought and sold "after the fashion of dogs and horses," and prized dentalia or "money-shells," blankets, food and other property were used to pay for them.'<br>
<br>
Slavery was widespread for in <B>1845, </B>by the estimate of two British army lieutenants, 5,146 persons lived in slavery in Hudson's Bay Company territories west of the Rocky Mountains, about one in every fifteen Indians.<br>
<br>
Other surveys record the percentage of Northwest Coast Indians enslaved as between four and six, perhaps higher.'<br>
<br>
The slave traffic could not be ignored by British officials who came to colonial British Columbia.  Parliament had abolished the British slave trade in 18O7 and legislated the end of slavery everywhere within the Empire in 1833.  The Foreign Office had conducted an international campaign to rid the world of the institution.  In New Caledonia and Oregon, the Hudson's Bay Company tried to eradicate slavery by denouncing it as illegal, by giving runaway slaves protection, and by considering all persons residing in company forts as free British subjects with absolute and legal rights.<br>
<br>
A "forcible emancipation," trader James Douglas wrote ]n 1838, was out of the question owing to native feelings.  But the "immoral system" of slave traffic could be suppressed by "moral influence." In other words, he trusted that the gradual voluntary extension of British law would eliminate slavery.<br>
<br>
Douglas's policy of non-interference in an indigenous institution, and of trusting to the moral influence of law, and presumably of
Christianity, for the eventual eradication of slavery showed an appreciation of the strength of Indian societies. Even as late as 1859 the Company did not attempt to free slaves by coercion.<br>
<br>
Rather, as is shown by the case of a Nanaimo Indian woman who had been captured in a foray by some Fort Rupert Kwakiuti, the Company engaged in the native custom of paying a reward for her return.  By British practices this was indeed, as the British Boundary Commission naturalist who witnessed the transaction wrote, "a strange purchase."'<br>
<br>
The coming of missionaries and legal institutions brought important moral suasion.  Missionaries provided much of the remedy, preaching the equality of souls and establishing new native economies free of slavery.  They had the support of the Crown and its representatives, who had to at least acknowledge civilly the powerful Aborigines Protection Society and other British humanitarian groups.  They had the support of some naval officers, many of whom like Admirals Moresby and Denman had served with distinction on the African slave patrols, and were themselves committed abolitionists.<br>
<br>
On the British Columbia coast, Royal Navy officers were obliged to act to free slaves.  Direct action could not be undertaken for a variety of reasons.  But they did attempt to stop endemic intertribal warfare, an effort which officers believed would eventually check both slave-taking and slave-trading.  And they sought to end these practices by extracting two promises from influential Indians: that they would cease to take or hold slaves and that they would end their marauding ways.<br>
<br>
Sometimes the mere presence of whites hindered slave-taking.  Com-
mander Mayne wrote that the existence of a white party at Fort Rupert prevented hostility between local Kwak'utl and some hundred Haida. On another occasion, at Fort Rupert, Captain George Henry Richards of H.M.S. Hecate, assisted by the presence of H.M.S. Alert, forced the ransom for one hundred blankets of a Nanaimo female slave named Husaw-i, whose husband had appealed to the authorities for redress.<br>
<br>
The Indians had sternly resisted, revealing "the attachment with which they cling to this among other habits of their restless, predatory lives."On the other hand, the chiefs promised that they would willingly abandon their ancient custom of killing and taking slaves if other tribes would do the same.'<br>
<br>
And during Navy patrols or expeditions to the Queen Charlotte Islands, the Nass River, and elsewhere, slaves or captives were freed usually one or two at a time, given protection, and frequently returned to their home tribes. It was not heroic work but one that went on in the usual course of gunboat activities.
In the process of following Douglas's guidelines, Navy officers provided a significant influence in changing native cultural mores.  Douglas believed that the abolition of slavery and the security of the settlements could best be achieved by telling the Indians, especially those at or near Fort Rupert, in the Queen Charlottes, in the Nass-Skeena area, and on the west coast of Vancouver Island, that they must stop fighting one another and that they must live by British law.<br>
<br>
Thus in 1860, when the Indian "danger" had reached its apex, H.M.S. Plumper, Termagant, and Alert, all under the command of Captain Richards, undertook to take the governor's message to the various warring tribes and to extract promises from their chiefs that they would live according to the law and stop fighting each other, especially during their annual voyages to Victoria.<br>
<br>
The vessels sailed from Esquimalt on 31 July, proceeded to Fort Rupert, and then, each taking a section of the coast, visited all the main Indian villages north of Vancouver Island as well as those on the Island's west coast.<br>
<br>
Everywhere the Indians received them very favorably.  At Laskeek <B>in</B> the Queen Charlotte Islands, for instance, the old chief Konyil came on board the Alert and got an explanation for the ship's visit.  His tribe, he was told, must stop its ancient habit of molesting other tribes.  Officers took pains to explain to Konyi] the advantages that would accrue to his tribe if they would live in peace and trust to the white man' s laws for redress in case of wrong when any of his people should be living in Victoria.<br>
<br>
The chief, visibly nervous because of the ship's presence, promised compliance and even offered to restore all slaves stolen from Vancouver island.  He agreed to stop any further marauding expeditions, a promise given in order that authorities would permit the Haida to make their annual excursion to Victoria.  Konyil's tribe, like others, was undergoing extensive social changes, owing in part to the numerous seductions of Victoria and the relentless process of acculturation.  This exchange between officials and the chief reveals that Konyil wanted to enlist the governor's aid in behalf of his people.<br>
<br>
At Skidegate, one of the largest and most important Haida villages, the Alerts officers learned just how severely these annual migrations were upsetting the Indian economies.  There Chief Nestecanna, himself a onetime slave, told of his sincere desire to live under British rule.  "You tell me King George sends you here to talk to all the Indians," he proudly told the British.  "I am all the same as King George.  Good you write down and tell Mr. Douglas and the Man of War to send all my people home.  I wanted to build a large house this summer and nearly all my people
are away at Victoria.""<br>
<br>
Near Masset the story was the same.  The fact that Edenshaw and the whole of his village were spending their summer in Victoria meant that they would not have put in a stock of provisions, particularly of dried fish, for the coming winter.<br>
<br>
Again, at Port Simpson naval officers explained to the Tsimshian "that our visit was friendly and that the British Government was anxious and indeed solicitous for their welfare, that it would be much more to their  interest and happiness to live peaceably and orderly among themselves, and of the greatest importance that they implicitly complied with the white man's laws when living among them, and this they were given clearly to understand would be vigorously enforced." They were told that the English "great chiefs" were angry at their ceaseless drinking, a vice which would destroy their whole race.<br>
<br>
They were also told of the British hatred of slavery, which could not exist wherever the British flag was unfurled.  They were instructed to stop molesting other tribes, to be cautious during their excursions to Victoria, and to obey English law.  Otherwise, retribution would follow.  They were also notified that the "evil deeds" of the Indians and those of their fathers would be forgotten, although as British subjects the Tsimshian would henceforth be held accountable in British law.  Lastly, the officers told the Indians that a warship would visit them periodically, it was hoped only on friendly terms.<br>
<br>
For their part, the chiefs promised obedience.  They blamed their troubles on liquor and appealed to the officials to adopt strict measures to check "spirit sellers" from going among them.  Young Tsimshian men and women promised to abstain from drinking, and "this marked expression of good intentions on the part of the Indians was a subject of mutual congratulations." At other coastal encampments captains of the warships announced that the government sought peace with and among the tribes, wanted to abolish slavery there as in other parts of the Empire, desired to end the liquor traffic, and, in general, intended to extend English law to the Northwest Coast.<br>
<br>
As a further step in this type of forest diplomacy, captains displayed their ships' firepower by exercising their gun crews, firing shot, shell, grapeshot, and canister to impress on the natives the force and utility of Her Majesty's guns."'<br>
<br>
This cruise helped to put an end to marauding expeditions among Northwest Coast Indians.  Governor Douglas's strategy of sending three warships at one time to win the accord of the natives was particularly adroit.  By extracting promises of mutual agreement
among the Haida, Tsimshian, Kwakiutl, and other chiefs, the British acted as peacemakers.<br>
<br>
The chiefs seem to have been more concerned with economic realities and the social consequences of their situation than with the moral implications of slavery as perceived by the British.  Nonetheless they apparently agreed to the terms presented.<br>
<br>
Thus gunboat diplomacy served to reduce internecine tensions and violence, helped achieve security for settlers, and weakened the tendency towards slave-taking and thus slave-trading.  After this cruise the Navy continued to investigate cases of slavery and to free slaves."<br>

THE RUSSIANS<br>
<br>
Edwin Van Syckle, "The Russians," <B>The River Pioneers.</B> Seattle: Pacific Search Press, 1982, p. 19-24.<br>
<br>
The Russians were thirty-three years behind the Spanish in their ill fated probing of the Northwest Coast.  But they did give <B>Grays Harbor a flicker of history</B>.  The year was 1808, just six years after the Tlingit massacre of the Russians at Sitka, then called New Archangel.<br>
<br>
On September 28, 1808, the Saint Nicholas, reportedly a "fine little brig acquired from the Yankees," sailed from New Archangel for an exploration and fur-trading expedition along what is now the coast of Washington.  She was under command of Nikolai Bulagin, a Russian naval officer.<br>
<br>
With him was his eighteen-year old wife, attractive and venturesome Anna Petrovna Bulagina, who was to have the distinction of being the first white woman to set foot on the West Coast.<br>
<br>
Aboard the Saint Nicholas were twenty people-seventeen men, four of them Aleuts, and three women, two of them Aleuts.  Timofei Tarakanov, the supercargo, had been with the garrison building the first fort at Sitka and was one of the few survivors of the Tlingit attack.  He had been captured and taken to a Tlingit village, and had been the last man rescued by Captains Ebbets and Barber.<br>
About the time the Saint Nicholas left New Archangel, so did another vessel of the Russian-American Company, the Kadiak (Kodiak) under Ivan A. Kouskov.  She was scheduled to put into Grays Harbor for a rendezvous with the Saint Nicholas, take aboard Timofei Tarakanov, and then proceed to probe the coast just north of California.<br>
<br>
The  Russian-American  Company,   organized   in   1799   by   Czar Paul, with Alexander Baranof as leader, was under heavy pressure to cast southward.  From the time the survivors of Vitus Bering's second and tragic expedition had returned in 1741 to Kamchatka with furs, to the establishment of the first Russian settlement of Bering's "Great Land" in 1784 at Three Saints on Kodiak Island, and the move of the Russian capital at the close of the eighteenth century to New Archangel, the Czar's people had exhausted the natural resources of the Aleutians.  They had to seek elsewhere.<br>
<br>
Baranof, although a capable leader, was also a tragedy maker.  In the Aleutians he made slaves of the more peaceful Aleuts, but when he attempted the same thing with the Tlingits-a more warlike people-he met resistance.  The Tlingits in 1802 overran Sitka and massacred the garrison, forcing the Russians to rebuild a short distance away.  This virtually denied Russian trade<br>
in Tlingit territory.<br>
<br>
Even more dangerous to Russian ambitions was the encroachment of American and English traders upon what the Russians claimed as their exclusive trading territory.  The Spaniards were already established at Nootka on the west coast of Vancouver Island.  The task of the Kodiak was to search out a California trading site to neutralize the inroads of Spain.<br>
<br>
So it was that the Saint Nicholas sailed from New Archangel that September day in 1808.  She sighted Cape Flattery at the entrance to the Strait of Juan de Fuca on October 10, but became bedeviled by calms and light winds, working northward along the coast of Vancouver Island.  There the ship's officers mapped the shore, while Bulagin tried to trade beads, cloth, and iron for sea otter pelts, deer, and fish.<br>
<br>
The Indians, however, would trade sea otter skins only for cloth like that in the jackets of the Russian sailors, or firearms, which the Russians would not sell.<br>
<br>
After working as far north as Clayoquot Sound, the Saint Nicholas sailed south to the vicinity of Destruction Island to begin surveying the shore in latitude 47 degrees 33  north.  She had hardly begun her survey when the wind fell calm and the heavy
Pacific ground swell swept her inshore, dangerously near the rocky coast, a short distance south of the mouth of the Quillayute River.  Captain Bulagin put out his anchors, but the cables chafed and parted.  The ship was thrown upon the rocky beach by a stiff on-shore wind.  She struck at high water to become a total wreck in latitude 47"56' north on November 1, 1808.<br>
<br>
The crew reached shore without losing a man.  Some arms, ammunition, tents, sails, provisions, and other goods were saved.  While they were salvaging what materials they could, the Quileute Indians stood around on the beach watching and stealing small articles when the opportunity afforded.  The Indians finally attacked the Russians with stones and spears, but faded into the underbrush when the Russians opened fire with muskets, killing two natives.<br>
<br>
Knowing the Russian ship Kodiak was to follow them south for a meeting at Grays Harbor, the survivors of the wrecked Saint Nicholas decided to attempt a journey down the coast on foot.  Accordingly, after throwing the ship's cannon and other equipment into the sea, the crew, taking their arms, ammunition, and<br>
small amount of food started  along the shore over a path pointed<br>
out to them by the Indians.<br>
<br>
After three days of stumbling along the rocky beach detouring around promontories through almost impenetrable masses of wind-matted salal, salmon berry, and dwarf spruce, and harassed by the natives, the crew reached a river (the Hoh) too deep to ford.  On the shore was an Indian settlement of bark "shalashes" or huts.<br>
<br>
The Russians hired some of the natives to take them across in canoes.  The Indians selected two canoes, into one of which nine Russians were loaded, while into the other canoe went Anna Petrovna, wife of the captain, an Aleut native of Kodiak Island, and a young Russian.<br>
<br>
In the middle of the river the Indians pulled a plug from the bottom of the larger canoe, then jumped overboard to swim ashore.  Indians on the opposite shore attacked the canoe with spears and arrows, wounding several of the Russians, one, a man named Sovasnikof, so severely he soon died.  The canoe drifted back toward the bank from which the party had embarked.<br>
<br>
The smaller canoe was landed close to the bark huts, where Anna Petrovna, the Aleut, and the Russian boy were made prisoners.  The Russians from the larger canoe fired on the Indians with such arms as had not gotten wet in the river, killing two natives and wounding several.
After the encounter the Russians withdrew to  a  small  hill  to<br>
make camp, fearful of their lives, for there were some 200 Indians opposing them.  Bulagin was overcome by the loss of his wife.  Adding to their misery, rain fell incessantly, all the muskets and ammunition were wet, provisions were exhausted, and stomachs growled with hunger.  The men searched for woods fungi, plant roots, and anything else that might serve as food.  They even ate pieces of their leather boots.<br>
<br>
In despair, Bulagin resigned leadership to Tarakanov.  On November 14, two weeks after the wreck of the Saint Nicholas,<br>
<br>
Tarakanov-also in desperation-decided to descend upon the village and fight the Indians.  The Russians found the Indians had departed.  From the huts they took as much dried salmon as they could carry and returned to the camp.<br>
<br>
A day or so later, attempting to find a route toward the mountains, Tarakanov, a hunter named Ovchinnikov, and an<br>
Aleut were ambushed by the Indians, the Aleut and Ovchinnikov being wounded by arrows.<br>
<br>
The three, however, were able to fight off the attack and return to camp.  They now gave up the idea of meeting the Kodiak on Grays Harbor, determining instead to make their way into the mountains for a winter camp.  Hampered by the rain and dense forest, the party made way slowly, but the few Indians they met proved friendly and offered salmon for beads and other trifles.<br>
<br>
After several days of exhausting travel, the Russians were overtaken by a native from the village at the river mouth.  He came with a proposal for the ransom of Anna Petrovna, to which Bulagin readily acceded, offering virtually all the remaining property the party possessed.  But the Indians demanded four muskets in addition to the offering.<br>
<br>
This the Russians refused, whereupon Bulagin asked to see his wife.  The interview was granted.  Following an emotional meeting, Bulagin begged for her return, but the Indians would not abandon their demand for the muskets and took Anna Petrovna away.<br>
<br>
After fighting their way upriver over gravel bars and through dense woods for a few more days, the Russians built a makeshift fortified camp with a log house and sentry boxes.<br>
<br>
During the winter they also built a boat, with which on February 8, 1809, they went downriver under the guidance of an old Indian.  At the mouth of the Hoh they camped opposite the Indian village.<br>
<br>
A large number of Indians gathered around the Russians, who as a
precaution captured two Indian women and a young man and held them as hostages for the release of Anna Petrovna and the others.  After a few days more natives appeared, bringing Anna Petrovna.  However, she refused to leave the Indians when the exchange was demanded.<br>
<br>
She said she had been well treated and that if she rejoined the Russians she would be compelled to wander through the forest half starved with but faint hope of rescue.  Bulagin became so enraged at her refusal to return that he threatened to shoot her, but later went away dejected and grieving.<br>
<br>
Tarakanov, hearing Anna Petrovna's story and Teaming that the other Russian captives had also been well treated, proposed to surrender to the Indians, hoping for rescue by some European ship along the coast.  Four other Russians joined him.  The rest attempted to cross to Destruction Island, but their boat was destroyed on the rocks with all the provisions lost.  The men barely escaped with their lives, only to be captured by the Indians.<br>
<br>
Tarakanov, who had surrendered himself to the Indians, was taken by a chief named Utramaka to his home near Cape Flattery, called by the Indians "Koonistchat." Bulagin was claimed by Utramaka, but was finally exchanged to the chief who held Anna Petrovna.  As was often the custom with Coast tribes, the prisoners were exchanged from hand to hand among the Indians.<br>
<br>
Anna Petrovna died in August 1809; her Indian master at the time threw her body into the forest, as was the Indian custom.  Bulagin, hearing of her fate, sickened and died of consumption the following February.<br>
<br>
Tarakanov was well treated by the natives, largely because of his resourcefulness, his knowledge of tools, and his capability to amuse the Indians, even to constructing and flying a kite.  In September 1810 the Indians, with Tarakanov, went eastward along the Strait of Juan de Fuca, but during the winter suffered severely for want of food.  On May 6, 1811, a brig came to anchor near the Indian camp.<br>
<br>
Tarakanov and his Indian master went on board, where they learned the vessel was the American Lydia under command of a Captain Brown, who soon set about ransoming the Indians' prisoners.<br>
Among the prisoners brought aboard was an Englishman, John Williams, who was ransomed for five measures of cloth, a locksmith's saw, two steel knives,. a looking glass, five packages of powder, and five bags of shot.<br>
<br>
The Indians accepted the same ransom for each of the Russians except for Bolotof and Kurmachof, for whom higher ransom was demanded.  Refused, the Indians took them away.  Captain Brown
then seized a chief who came aboard, and held him hostage for delivery of the remaining Russian captives.  All were brought within a few days.<br>
<br>
Thirteen captives were successfully ransomed; seven had died in captivity, while one Aleut was later ransomed on the Columbia River by the American ship Mercury. One Russian named Philip Kotilnikof had been traded away so far he could not be found.  The Lydia sailed May 10, 1811, from the Strait to Sitka, arriving June 8, 1811.<br>
<br>
There is no record of the Kodiak's calling on Grays Harbor, whether because of a change of plans, or because her master Kouskov had teamed of the Saint Nicholas disaster and reasoned that it would be useless to attempt the rendezvous.<br>

CHINOOKS AND THE SLAVE TRADE.<br>
<br>
Edward Harper Thomas, "The Chinooks and the Slave Trade," <B>Chinook, a history and dictionary. </B> Portland; Binfords and Mort, 1970. p. 12-13.<br>
<br>
The Chinooks were one of the most powerful tribes on the Pacific Northwest Coast and by virtue of numbers and warlike qualities held sway over much of the region.  They were surrounded by such immediate and lesser tribes as the Clatsops, Cathlamets, Wahkiakums, Chehalis and numerous others extending far up the river to the Klickitats, Nez Perces and Walla Wallas.<br>
<br>
Among the tribes along all this coast and far into the interior, slavery was an established and time-honored institution.  Taking and selling slaves was a commercial pursuit.<br>
<br>
The Chinooks dignified it by making it the one great business in which they engaged.  They were the profiteers in this particular trade.  They made raids upon their neighbors, conquered tribes and villages and sold the victims to other warlike masters living in the wildernesses to the north and northwest.<br>
<br>
The Nootkans were among the Chinooks' best customers.  That was because they had a monopoly on the shell money supply.  In certain comparatively shallow waters of their tribal territory, on sub-
merged shelves and banks known to them and controlled by them,<br>
certain small but beautiful shells were found.  
The supply was limited, which added to their value.  The method of fishing for them was one known in those early times only to the Nootkans and favored related tribes.  The wealth of the Nootkans lay in these shells.  They were the money of all the tribes.<br>
<br>
The Nootka coveted slaves and used them for all the labor of the villages, fisheries and camps.  The Chinooks could furnish an unfailing supply of slaves.  Both these tribes grew rich exchanging shell money and slaves.  The Nootka resold the men and women bought from the Chinooks.  It is said that often a slave lost his identity completely and finally had no recollection of his former home or people.<br>
<br>
This business required some vehicle of communication.  The Noot-
kans learned some of the simpler and easier words of the Chinook dialect, and the Chinooks picked up a bit of Nootkan.<br>
<br>
This interchange of a very few words capable of conveying the simpler ideas of barter and exchange became the nucleus of <B>the </B>jargon.  It was gradually added to by the acquisition of easy Salish and Kwakiutl expressions.  A Cathlamet word is broadly Chinook, as the Cathlamets are a Lower Columbia people and rather closely related tribally to the Chinooks.  Any Chehalis word is Salish, as the Chehalis belong to that family.<br>
<br>
The Makahs are entirely surrounded by Salish stock, but are an isolated group of Nootkans, separated from the parent tribe by the straits of Juan de Fuca.  A Bellabella word is Kwakiutl since the Bellabella are an important tribe of the Kwakuitl family, as are the Heiltsuq and Nimpkish.  The Nootkans live on the west coast of Vancouver Island and the Kwakiutl on the east coast and the contiguous mainland of British Columbia.<br>
<br>
All of these tribes traded among themselves, using this trade lan-
guage for the purposes of their commerce.  Consequently there are words of all these tribal dialects and family stock tongues to be found in the jargon.<br>
<br>
The theory of this work is that the Jargon had its beginning in the trade necessities of the prehistoric, centuries-old slave and shell money commerce carried on primarily between the Lower Chinooks and the equally powerful, intelligent and enterprising Nootkans; that it slowly developed by accretion in their increasing contact with other Indian nations, taking a word here and a word there from the dialects of other tribes; and that it was finally used by all of the Indians of the Northwest Coast in their commercial relations.<br>
<br>
The vocabulary was very limited then, and still is; but the words were flexible and capable of conveying many meanings, depending for that upon emphasis, stress, tone of voice and gesture.<br>
<br>
After the traders came, in the early years of the last century,
words of French and English origin were added and the jargon grew into a trade language, comprehensive enough for all purposes of intercourse between all the tribes and all the whites within the territory extending from what is now southern Oregon to southeastern Alaska and from the shores of the Pacific east to the Rocky Mountains.  It finally developed into its present-day form.<br>
<br>
At one time the Chinook jargon was spoken by approximately a hundred thousand persons, Indians and whites and mixed bloods.  Nearly all of the early settlers of Oregon, Washington and British Columbia, miners, loggers and traders, too, spoke it as fluently and as constantly as the Indians, finding it indispensable because of their intimate and close relations with the natives.<br>
<br>
The jargon probably reached its maximum popularity and usefulness in the seventies and then began to go into decline.  With the advent of the transcontinental railroads and the consequent inrush of an immigration that wholly submerged the native population, it fell into disuse.<br>
