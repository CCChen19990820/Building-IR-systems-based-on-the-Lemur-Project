From Edupage, 27 Dec 1994:

GOV'T RECOMMENDS ELECTRONIC COPYRIGHT RESTRICTIONS 
The draft report on copyright law issued last July is drawing fire from
some academics and librarians, who say it gives copyright holders too much
power and "ought to maintain the balance that is maintained in the print
world," according to a law professor who moderates an Internet forum on
copyright law. One particular sticking point is U.S. Patent &amp; Trademark
Office Commissioner Lehman's opposition to allowing libraries to ship books
electronically to patrons, because an extra copy would show up in each
recipient's computer. "To me, the burden on those who would say that ought
to be a fair use is extraordinarily high. You would see massive dislocation
of the market for that work," says Lehman. The draft report was used to
represent the U.S. position in recent meetings of the World Intellectual
Property Organization, and Lehman says a basically unaltered final report
will be ready in the spring. (Wall Street Journal 12/27/94 B5)

An Open Letter to Our Colleagues In the Online Communications Community:

The announcement by CompuServe and Unisys that users of the GIF image format
must register by January 10 [1995] and pay a royalty or face lawsuits for
their past usage, is the online communications community's equivalent of the
sneak attack at Pearl Harbor.

The announcement of the CompuServe-Unisys GIF Tax on December 29, during the
lull between Christmas and New Year's Day, was clearly timed to cause
maximum damage while an unsuspecting public celebrated the holidays.

We at TeleGrafix Communications have no quarrel with those who seek to
protect their intellectual property and profit from it.  Indeed, we are in
business to do the same.  We believe those who develop software are entitled
to reap financial rewards from their labors.

But in our opinion, the timing and circumstances of the CompuServe-Unisys
action indicates this is a shakedown of the online communications community
by two powerful corporations, rather than a reasonable effort to protect
intellectual property.

The GIF format has been in widespread public use since 1987.  Its widespread
use and royalty-free licensing has been encouraged by CompuServe for years.
Neither CompuServe or Unisys have made any significant improvements to GIF
or its underlying LZW algorithm and compression process to justify charging
for what has been free.

Giving GIF users only 14 days to comply with sudden, unexpected demands to
pay the private CompuServe-Unisys GIF Tax or face prosecution for past usage
of what had been promoted for seven years as free, open standard software is
unconscionable. It is especially outrageous since CompuServe and Unisys
admit in writing that they decided to require licensing SIX MONTHS AGO in
June, and didn't announce it to the public until now.

According to the CompuServe-Unisys GIF licensing agreement, the settlement
of the patent dispute was executed on June 21, 1994.  CompuServe agreed to
implement the agreement "as soon as reasonably practicable and in no case
later than six (6) months after the date this Agreement is executed..."
That six month period ended on December 21, 1994 -- but CompuServe did not
make the licensing terms public until December 28.  Indeed, CompuServe
appears to have violated the terms of its own settlement agreement with
Unisys.

While many of the messages we have read online in reaction to the
CompuServe-Unisys GIF Tax decree express both dismay and disbelief,
virtually none have analyzed the actual provisions of the licensing
agreement.  It is in this area that TeleGrafix Communications wishes to
contribute to the dialogue.

In our opinion, the CompuServe-Unisys licensing agreement is both illogical
and overly broad.  Let's examine some of its key provisions. All quotes
cited are directly from the agreement.

1. CompuServe will license Developers who want to use GIF technology.  The
term "developer" is defined as "the other undersigned party to the
agreement," and it seems to apply to ANYONE who contemplates distributing
any product that uses the GIF format.

2.  Developers will be licensed to sell or distribute "Products" that "use
and exploit GIF...solely within the Field of Use."  The term "Field of Use"
is defined as "primarily for accessing the CompuServe Information Service
and for manipulating and viewing data received through the CompuServe
Information Service."  The licensing agreement further defines the term
"Products" as being "software that is developed or distributed...which is
designed for and used primarily for accessing the CompuServe Information
Service and for manipulating and viewing data received through the
CompuServe Information Service."  IT APPEARS THAT THE ONLY LAWFUL USE OF GIF
WILL BE FOR COMPUSERVE-RELATED PRODUCTS.  Using GIF images in any other
manner, such as on CD-ROMs or bulletin board systems, is prohibited.  Most
of the thousands of products that have used GIF in some manner are
henceforth contraband.

3. Developers may no longer "use, copy, modify or distribute the GIF
specification, except as expressly permitted by CompuServe."  This states
that the GIF specification can no longer be shared, published or uploaded in
any manner without the express consent of CompuServe.

4. Members of the public are prohibited from using any software product
containing GIF until they have become a REGISTERED user of the product.  The
customer also must agree to use the product "primarily for accessing the
CompuServe Information Service and for manipulating and viewing data
received through the CompuServe Information Service."  This virtually
eliminates the concept of freeware or shareware containing GIF capabilities,
since prospective customers can no longer try out these software products
without registering them first.

5. Software developers must pay $1.00 for a license to use GIF, PLUS a fee
equal to the GREATER of 1.5% of the selling price of the product, or $0.15
per "Disposition."  Disposition is defined as "the sale, lease or license or
any other grant of rights to a Product or any new Product."  All royalties
must be paid quarterly.  Noncommercial and freeware usage of GIF technology
is NOT exempted from the royalty requirement.  Because the royalty
provisions and definition of "Disposition" are so broad in scope, it appears
that a GIF Tax payment may be due to CompuServe-Unisys each time a GIF image
is transmitted via BBS or Internet.  The operators of a BBS or World Wide
Web site with hundreds or thousands of GIF images online could easily be
bankrupted by these licensing requirements.

6. CompuServe must be notified of ANY new product using GIF when it is first
offered to customers.

7. Persons using GIF must keep records of its use, and CompuServe has the
right to audit those records every year upon seven days notice.  Persons
using GIF must pay the cost of the audit if a royalty underpayment of 10%
or more is discovered, along with 12% interest on any underpaid royalties.

8. Even if the patent is later found by the courts or the U.S. Patent Office
to be invalid and unenforceable, or if the patent expires, any developer must
"return all copies of the GIF specification and any confidential information
of CompuServe then in its possession or control to CompuServe, (ii) stop
using the Licensed Technology, and (iii) stop distributing Products."  This
states that EVEN IF THE PATENT IS OVERTURNED OR EXPIRES, YOU MUST STOP USING
OR DISTRIBUTING GIF.

9. Even though CompuServe has publicly disseminated the text of the
agreement it wants GIF users to sign, the terms of the agreement are to
remain confidential.  This is illogical, to say the least, since they have
posted it for public download on their own system.

10. Developers have to indemnify and hold CompuServe harmless for any
damages if their CUSTOMERS somehow use GIF technology in a way not permitted
by the licensing agreement.

11. Unisys has the right to enforce the agreement, as well as CompuServe.
Further, Unisys has the right to pursue legal action or seek damages against
Developers even after the agreement has terminated.

TeleGrafix Communications Inc. will not sign such a licensing agreement.  We
think most other software developers, BBS sysops and Web site operators also
will refuse to sign.

We encourage our colleagues in the online communications community to
evaluate the CompuServe-Unisys action, and to lodge appropriate protests
directly with those companies.

We believe that the CompuServe-Unisys GIF Tax drives a stake through the
heart of Internet development.  It will cripple the World Wide Web, NCSA
Mosaic, and other Internet multimedia technologies that rely heavily on GIF
imaging.

Fortunately, we at TeleGrafix Communications do not depend on GIF imaging in
our new RIPscrip 2.0 online multimedia technologies.  We chose to implement
the JPEG image format and only recently decided to add GIF support as a
convenience to our customers.  Due to the restrictive conditions of the
CompuServe-Unisys GIF Tax and licensing agreement, we must now reevaluate
our plans for supporting GIF use in the upcoming release of RIPscrip 2.0.

While our company hopes to profit financially from our advanced RIPscrip 2.0
technology, we will not demand royalties from those who have used the
freeware versions of our earlier RIPscrip 1.54 products and/or technical
specifications.  The RIPscrip 2.0 specification also will be made public for
third-party use after it is finalized.

We expect that the CompuServe-Unisys action will spell the death of GIF
as a commercially viable technology, shifting the attention of the online
communications community to JPEG imaging.

 "You are invited to discover Wired magazine - free"

 I received a pretty snazzy advertisement for Wired magazine 2 weeks
 ago and I decided to order the "free sample copy".  I have placed the
 postage paid reply card in the mail 3 times,  and 3 times a day or so
 later the same reply card has returned.  It turns out that the reply
 card has my name and address on the flip side in the same position
 as the address of Wired magazine on the "correct side."   Additionally
 the postal service 5+4 bar coding is on both sides of the card - once
 for Wired magazine and once for "me".  I'll toss it in the mail once again.

I am currently using a fourth-generation language called NOMAD2.  NOMAD2
stores dates internally as the number of milliseconds since a date in the
1580s when the Gregorian calendar was first put into use.  At least the
version of NOMAD2 that I use does (1).

For the most part, this seems to work out very well.  Much of the fears
about what happens with computer-stored dates on January 1, 2000 are
groundless for NOMAD2.  But perhaps not all of them.  Using an appropriate
date data type may have led to a false sense of security.

Most years are entered in the application system I'm working with as two
digits.  NOMAD2 allows this and effectively adds 1900 to years entered as
two-digit years.  When the system date changes to 2000, I'm not sure whether
NOMAD2 will start adding 2000 to the years entered.  (There may even be a
system variable for setting this.)  Regardless, on 1-Jan-200, it will still
not be appropriate to add 2000 to years from the now previous century or
1900 to years from the now current century.  Any arbitrary scheme to treat,
say, the entered years 30 through 99 as 1930 through 1999 and 00 through 29
as 2000 through 2029 would lead to problems (2) since the system I'm working
with could involve birthdates of 1929 and before.

Since the department I am working in has chosen to stay with the current
version of NOMAD2 (1), any new schemes for handling this problem may be lost
to my application.  The whole topic of staying with a stable release of a
system and not getting improvements or fixes to existing errors versus going
to new releases that have improvements, may fix existing faults, but may
introduce new ones is a rich risk management topic.

NOTES:

1.  A new application system in another operating environment is replacing
the one I am maintaining.  As a consequence, no further upgrades are being
planned for NOMAD2 in our operating environment.  The vendor of NOMAD2
continues to make upgrades.  The vendor's most release dealt with a date
problem from one its clients.  The client was storing uninitialized dates on
its DB2 database as something like January 1 of the year 0 which DB2's date
data type allows.  NOMAD2 can map DB2 databases, but its date data type did
not allow dates before the introduction of the Gregorian calendar.  (I
assume they haven't had any clients who wanted to store archaeological
data.)  The client was stubborn and the new release of NOMAD2 contains a fix
for the problem.  I'm not aware of the implementation details.

2.  As Brian Hayes noted in "Waiting for 01-01-00" on p. 14 of
January-February 1995's _American Scientist_.

There is no way to obtain the system date and time in one statement in
COBOL.  A program could get the date just before midnight and then get the
time relative to the day after the date it got.  A timestamp of 31-Dec-1994
00:00:01 indicates just after midnight between 30-Dec-1994 and 31-Dec-1994,
but it could have been obtained from a COBOL program running around midnight
between 31-Dec-1994 and 1-Jan-1995.

The only way in a COBOL program to assure that the time obtained is for the
date obtained is to loop getting the date, then the time, and then the date
again until both dates match (as would usually be the case).

No one knows how often such a check is performed in existing COBOL code, but
I would guess it is very rare.  No one knows how likely such an error would
occur or what consequences it might have.  But it certainly is not
desirable.  (It's a little like the Pentium FDIV bug.)

I haven't heard of any problems actually caused by this, but the potential
risk is there as it is in any language that makes accessing the date and
time simultaneously impossible.  (I believe BASIC shares this problem with
COBOL.)

Application software typically draws the current date and time directly from
the system.  Not using data hiding, that is, drawing the current time from
another application module, may cause problems with testing and could lead
to faults due to the difficulty of testing if it is not possible to change
the system date and time during a test.

A realtime financial application may want to close the books for the now
previous day when the time goes past midnight.  I've heard of such an
application and the developers did not use data hiding.  As a result they
had to run their tests when the system (and actual) time changed to
midnight.  Therefore, only one test could be run each night and in this case
they had to rearrange their normal 8-5 working hours to center around
midnight.  Introduction of changes and fixes were more easily introduced
when the programs were modified to access the "current" date and time
through a common module that could shift the time during a test.

However, as with most things, the tradeoff of using data hiding instead of
directly accessing the system date and time opens up the potential risk of
accidentally using test times in a production environment.  (This risk might
still be present if a test was allowed to alter the system date and time
thereby moving data hiding to another level.)

In a few IBM 1401-based programs at the insurance company I was working at
in the late 1960s, the year was stored as a one-character field!
Fortunately the problem of going from 1969 to 1970 in these programs was
recognized in time, the programs were few in number and modest in size (our
1401s had a maximum main memory of 8K), and the programs were corrected in
time.

Stating the fact that COBOL has a default date format used in its
special-registers bypasses the fact that COBOL has no date data type for the
storing of fates (Freudian-slip, make that dates).

This has left the coders of the billions of lines of existing COBOL code
free to invent as many date formats as human creativity will allow.  In my
reading, use, and maintaining of COBOL code in over twenty-six years of
information system programming, this is a surprisingly large number.

This is one of the reasons "dusty deck" COBOL systems are such a problem as
the year 2000 draws near.  No assumptions can be made as to how dates are
stored in COBOL-based systems and files.  Also, the manipulation of a given
format varies from one COBOL program to the next.  There is no guarantee
that any installation-wide modules are used for date manipulation.
(Installation-wide is pretty much the best you can hope for; COBOL itself
has no date manipulating modules.)

Actually, there is no guarantee that date routines will even be concentrated
and re-used within a given COBOL program.  Date processing is often
scattered throughout the program, with each date variable having not only
its own unique processing but different code for the same operations on a
given date at different points in a program.

Obviously, some of this date code may contain errors.  In many cases the
errors are compensated for, consciously or unconsciously, by the program's
developers or maintainers.  So correcting a date computation at one point
may lead to an error because the next use of the date has an existing
correction for the previous error.

   [Thanks to Fred, who also pointed out an error on Page 88 of my RISKS
   book, which should have read "COBOL uses a two-character YEAR field"
   (instead of DATE).  Sorry!  PGN]

			   CALL FOR PAPERS
                             COMPASS '95

10th Annual IEEE Conference                     June 26--30, 1995
on COMPuter ASSurance (COMPASS)                 Gaithersburg, MD USA

Sponsored by IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Society
         and IEEE National Capital Area Council
In cooperation with The British Computer Society

The purpose of this conference is to bring together researchers,
developers, integrators, and evaluators who work on problems related
to specifying, building, and certifying high-assurance,
high-consequence computer systems.  What distinguishes COMPASS from
similar conferences is its emphasis on bridging the gap between
research and practice.  For researchers this provides an opportunity
to present new results, theories, and techniques both to other
researchers, and to practitioners who can put them to use.  They can
also learn from practitioners of issues and problems encountered in
building real systems.  Practitioners have an opportunity to share
lessons learned, to hear of new research, and to influence future
research directions.

The conference will be held at the National Institute of Standards
and Technology in Gaithersburg, Maryland, which is a suburb of
Washington DC (4 miles from the Shady Grove Metro Station).
The proceedings will be published by the IEEE.

Papers should present advances in the theory, design, implementation,
evaluation, or application of high-assurance systems, or report on
experiments, evaluations, and open problems in the use of new
technologies for computer assurance.  Special consideration will be
given to presentations (either single papers or paper pairs) by
practitioners and researchers who have worked on the same problem.
There will also be a tools fair and the conference will be preceded by
one or two days of tutorials.  Papers, panel session proposals,
tutorial proposals, and tools fair proposals are solicited in

In 1987, CompuServe designed the Graphics Interchange Format (GIF)
specification for graphics files.  The GIF specification incorporated the
Lempel-Zev-Welch (LZW) compression technology on which Unisys Corporation
was independently pursuing a patent filing.  In early 1993, Unisys notified
CompuServe of patent rights granted to LZW.  At that time, CompuServe began
negotiating with Unisys to secure a licensing agreement.  This agreement was
reached in mid-1994, and CompuServe then initiated a process to secure a
similar license that would benefit its GIF developer community.

Following the agreement reached between CompuServe and Unisys, CompuServe
announced the Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) Developer Agreement, shortly
after its completion, on December 29, 1994.  This agreement is aimed at GIF
developers who are developing programs and shareware primarily for use in
conjunction with CompuServe.  The service offers a license to these
developers to use LZW technology in programs written to the GIF
specification.

CompuServe remains committed to keeping open the GIF 89a specification both
within CompuServe and in areas outside CompuServe.  CompuServe continues to
strongly support the use of the GIF specification in the entire online
community including the Internet and World Wide Web.  This agreement will be
transparent to end-users and will not result in any charges for people using
viewers or transmitting GIF images.

The agreement offers software and shareware developers who use the LZW
technology in their GIF programs protection under a software license that
CompuServe is authorized to grant under the agreement with Unisys.
Developers who choose to take advantage of this service would acquire the
rights to use the LZW technology in certain software and shareware developed
primarily for use in conjunction with CompuServe.  Developers who choose to
participate in this agreement within the implementation period will also
benefit in that Unisys has agreed not to pursue royalty claims for past use
of the LZW technology in GIF.  The implementation period has been extended
to January 31, 1995.
 
CompuServe has presented this new agreement as a service to its GIF
developer community.  Cost to developers will be a $1.00 one-time licensing
fee and a royalty payment of 1.5 percent or $0.15, whichever is greater, per
registered copy of a program containing the LZW technology.  CompuServe will
not profit from this service.

CompuServe encourages developers to work with Unisys directly if the GIF
Developer Agreement does not meet their needs.  Unisys is continuing to make
the LZW technology available to any interested parties under reasonable and
non-discriminatory terms.  Developers are not required to register with
CompuServe.  Registering with CompuServe is simply one option for addressing
the Unisys LZW patent issue.  Developers may want to consider consulting
with legal counsel.

CompuServe is committed to keeping the GIF 89A specification as an open,
fully-supported, non-proprietary specification for the entire online
community including the World Wide Web.  Whether they choose to register
with CompuServe or not, developers are encouraged to continue use the GIF
specification within their products.

A copy of the GIF Developer Agreement is available in the Library section of
the CompuServe Graphics Support Forum (GO GRAPHSUP) and will shortly be
posted to CompuServes World Wide Web page (<A HREF="HTTP:\\WWW.COMPUSERVE.COM)">HTTP:\\WWW.COMPUSERVE.COM)</A>.
Developers who are not developing software primarily for use in conjunction
with CompuServe should contact Unisys directly at: Welch Patent Desk, Unisys
Corp., P.O. Box 500, Bluebell, PA 19424 Mailcode C SW 19.

Sincerely, 

Tim Oren,  CompuServe Vice President,  Future Technology

The Reuter newswire reports on last year's Datastream case:

	RTw 94.01.03 05:55 EST
	Teenage hacker taps into U.S. defence secrets

	LONDON, Jan 3 (Reuter) - A British teenager allegedly hacked 
	into sensitive U.S. government computers and was able to 
	monitor secret communications over the North Korean nuclear 
	crisis last spring, the Independent newspaper reported on Tuesday.
 
	The boy tapped into several defence computers for seven months 
	in what U.S. officials conceded was one of the most serious 
	breaches of computer security in recent years, the paper said.

The article continues with the following key points:
 
* The youngster posted the data on the Internet and was labelled
"Datastream" because of the volume of information he supplied.

* He "was finally caught by special U.S. investigators because he left 
  his terminal on-line to a U.S. defence computer overnight."

* The child was arrested in July in Britain.

* "...[P]rosecutors are expected to decide this month whether he can 
  be charged, the Independent said."

* "...[T]he U.S. Air Force Office of Special Investigations acknowledged 
  the hacker could have accessed and read the Korean files.

German Information Security Agency (GISA, in German: Bundeasamt fuer
Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik, BSI) has prepared a CD-ROM containing
the draft (version 0.9) of the Common Criteria presently being issued by a
committee of experts from USA, Canada and European Union. This
(unclassified) version will be sent to every interested person together with
accompanying material guiding comments (deadline of comments: March 1,1995).
Interested experts should send a fax to

                   German Information Security Agency

Most regrettably, the CD-ROM is designed for PC work. When trying to mount
the CD-ROM in the mode usually adapt to read PC CD-ROM formats, we succeeded
to crash our SUN OS 4. As our SOLARIS systems have no CD-ROMs, we could not
test whether this may work. (Nice to crash insecUNIX with INFOSEC material :-).

Klaus Brunnstein (Dec.30,1994)

PS: I asked BSI whether we may offer the CDROM material via our ftp-site. BSI 
    informed me that they wish to be sure that the letter with guidance to
    the comment process accompanies the CD-ROM so I cannot offer this material 
    via ftp :-)

The Associated Press newswire (via CompuServe's Executive News Service)
reports on addiction to computers on an article datelined 94.12.26 @ 00:00
EST:

  Computer Addiction

  By PATRICE GRAVINO, Associated Press Writer 

  KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- It answers immediately and makes few demands. It
  can introduce you to new friends and lovers, entertain you, organize your
  bills and provide expert information about almost any topic.

  It's the nearly perfect companion: your computer.

  But many people, from industry experts to social scientists, are
  beginning to ask -- and debate -- whether there's such a phenomenon
  as "computer addiction" and whether it's becoming a problem.

The author goes on to cite several anecdotal cases:

o	A "former computer instructor in Kansas City" explains the breakup
of his 16-year marriage in part to the time he spent at his computer.

o	"[F]uturist Andre Bacard, a physicist and author based at Stanford
University in California, where he researches the social impact of
technology," reports several acquaintances who spend an inordinate amount of
time online.  Some "belong to a half-dozen computer networks, and they
log-on to one after another. Their entire social world is vicarious."  He
adds, "I think it both encourages and cultivates psychosis in many people."

o	Some psychologists report having to help parents pull their children
away from their computers because they are neglecting schoolwork and
withdrawing from social interactions not mediated by computers.

o	"Steve Spaw, a computer graphics consultant in Kansas City,"  reports
that he has to force himself not to spend _all_ his time with his system.

o	"Dr. James Donley, medical director of outpatient psychiatry at the
University of Kansas Medical Center in Kansas City, Kan.," reports few
obvious cases of computer addiction so far, but feels that there's certainly
a potential.  He draws parallels with the potentially excessive involvement
in the world of pets that some enthusiasts display.  He also points to the
"inherently self-centered" activity where "people have a fairly simple
relationship, where you can kind of predict or dictate what happens....  It
can be used as an avoidance of social relationships."  He argues that
susceptibility to computer addiction "more to do with their personalities
than with computers."

&lt;&lt;Comments by M.K.: As I have mentioned before, computer addiction, if it
exists, conforms to what University of Chicago Professor Mihaly
Csikszentmihalyi has defined as "autotelic" behaviour.  He describes this
complex of behavioural cues in his book, _Flow: The Psychology of Optimal
Experience_ (1990).  Harper &amp; Row (New York).  ISBN 0-06-016253-8.  xii +
303.

Basically, his research suggests that highly enjoyable activities share certain
attributes (p. 48 ff):

o	Challenging activity that requires skills
o	Merging action and awareness
o	Clear goals an feedback
o	Concentration on the task at hand
o	Sense of control
o	Loss of self-consciousness
o	Transformation of time.

Flow is certainly not inherently dangerous; however, as in any human
experience, some outliers will cross the fuzzy boundaries from wholesome
involvement and commitment into crazy excess.  Perhaps it would be
appropriate for such people to glue timers to their computers!  I can
imagine someone writing a TSR which alerts them with a voice warning:
"Susan, it's time to stop using your computers now: you've been working
steadily for [fill in appropriate time limit] hours." &lt;grin&gt;

Have any RISKS readers experienced such involvement with computer programs
that they worry about the possibility of harmful effects on their relations
with others?  Do social relations through network communications supplant
live interactions?  Is there any reason to be any more concerned about
spending, say, three hours online in a multi-user dimension than three hours
chatting on the phone or--for that matter--three hours in one's own living
room serving a friend tea?&gt;&gt;

I recently bought a copy of a book called "The Virus Creation Labs" by
George C.  Smith (American Eagle, ISBN 0-929408-09-8) and it contains
material, bulleted below, which may be of interest.

----The hiring of a hacker called Priest (who programmed the Satan Bug and
    Natas viruses) by Norman Data Defense, the developer of anti-virus
    software.  The author writes that the initial job offer was carried
    by US Secret Service agents questioning the hacker after the agency's
    network was trashed by Satan Bug in 1993.

----A look back at the AIS Security Branch bulletin board system and the
    bruhaha surrounding its archive of hacker utilities and virus code.
    The coverage by the Washington Post and Associated Press is reviewed,
    and there are some interviews and comment from some of the people involved.

----A revealing look at the cozy relationship between some virus writers
    (who were looking for a little press) and some anti-virus software
    producers (who were looking for even more press and copies of the 
    viruses in question).

The AP newswire (via CompuServe's Executive News Service) for 94.12.30 @ 20:02
EST reports on a murder plot ruined by use of a cordless phone:

	Scanner Plot

	MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- A woman listening to a police scanner
	she had gotten for Christmas picked up a conversation over 
	cordless telephones and heard what turned out to be a murder 
	plot unfolding, investigators say.

The article explains that Donna McGee heard a woman and her boyfriend plotting
to kill the woman's husband and then collect insurance money.  As the family
gathered around in horror, "Mrs. McGee's daughter recognized a playmate's name"
and the family figured out "the identity of the intended victim."

Law enforcement officials said that because Mrs McGee was not purposely
zeroing in on a specific conversation but only scanning across the bands,
she had broken no laws in listening to the murder plot.

&lt;&lt;MK:  People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw binoculars.&gt;&gt;

&gt;From the Reuter newswire 94.12.29 @ 15:07 EST (via CompuServe's Executive News
Service):

	JERUSALEM, Dec 29 (Reuter) - The Israeli army has taken its 
	best shot at a formidable new foe -- an insatiable craze for 
	cellular phones, which have fast become an essential extra 
	in soldiers' kit.

The article explains that cell phones have become a problem for the army because
"soldiers, especially reservists, have begun taking them on army duty, vexing
commanders by making stock market deals and chatting to loved ones even during
live-ammunition exercises."

It is now forbidden to carry cell phones on duty and officers may "forbid a
soldier from having a cellular phone at all."

&lt;&lt;Comments from MK:  The article did not say, but RISKS and NCSA Forum readers
will agree, that using unencrypted cellular phones for _military_ matters would
be a serious mistake.&gt;&gt;

&gt;Would English speakers have reacted equally strongly to a -- no pun intended
&gt;-- comparable bug in the instructions for comparing and branching?  I think
&gt;they would not.

On the contrary, it would be far worse: the computer would be accused
of not being able to make up its mind!

I'd like to respond to a few statements made in <A HREF="/Risks/16.69.html">RISKS-16.69</A>.

Fred Ballard pointed out the risk of a COBOL program running near midnight
and retrieving the system date and time as two separate operations.  He
suggests looping, getting the date, the time, and the date again, to make
sure the date and time came from the same day.  I have used that technique
in all the code I have written, and have wondered whether anyone else
worried about such things.

The good news is that the COBOL language now provides a way to get the date
and time in a single statement.  The ANSI COBOL 1985 standard was officially
updated in 1989 with the Intrinsic Function module, which I believe many
vendors have implemented.  There is now a CURRENT-DATE function that
provides, with a single function reference, the system date, time, and local
time differential from Greenwich Mean Time (if known).

Several other of Mr. Ballard's concerns were also addressed in the same
addendum to the COBOL standard.  The CURRENT-DATE function returns the date
and time in a standard 21-character format that includes four digits for the
year.

Addressing the multiplicity of date formats in use, the updated standard
defines three: standard date form (YYYYMMDD), Julian date form (YYYYDDD),
and integer date form (a numeric value representing the number of days
counting from January 1, 1601, of the Gregorian calendar).  The standard
addresses date processing by providing functions to convert between integer
date form and the other two forms.

In summary, the COBOL language has addressed the problems.  Now it's up to
COBOL programmers to learn and start using what the language provides.

&gt; There is no way to obtain the system date and time in one statement in COBOL.

Because most operating systems separate the request for time from the 
request for date.  I can't think of any system where the date and time 
are returned in a single request; there probably are but I can't think of 
any.  OS/MVS on IBM mainframes, Decsystem 20 on Digital Mainframes, RSTS/E 
and RT11 on Digital Minicomputers, MSDOS, VS/9 on Univac Mainframes, none 
of these returned date in the same call as time.

&gt; The only way in a COBOL program to assure that the time 
&gt; obtained is for the date obtained is to loop getting the date, 
&gt; then the time, and then the date again until both dates match 
&gt; (as would usually be the case).

I guess it's because with the exception of batch jobs being run at that
time, most jobs run at some time other than exactly midnight - usually it's
during business hours - and thus the problem only exists for two minutes of
the day, e.g. during the one minute before midnight and the one minute
after.  The other 1438 minutes of the day, it's not a problem.  Actually
it's less than that.  The problem is during the last one second of the last
minute of the day and the first second of the first minute of the next day,
since unless the call for date and time occurs exactly at that precise
instant, and that one of them occurs just before 00:00:00 and the other just
after.  This means, that during 86,398 seconds of the day this isn't an
issue, and is during "alpha and omega, the first and the last", is when the
problem occurs.

This sort of issue pops up so rarely that it's not something one thinks
about much.  In fact, a lot of reports print date only, so the time doesn't
matter one way or the other.

&gt; I haven't heard of any problems actually caused by this, but the potential
&gt; risk is there as it is in any language that makes accessing the date and
&gt; time simultaneously impossible.  (I believe BASIC shares this problem with
&gt; COBOL.)

I captured a print out from running GW Basic:

  Ok
  PRINT TIME$
  22:33:44
  Ok
  PRINT DATE$
  01-03-1995
  Ok

The question is how fast is the timing here.  Just how many date and time 
requests can a basic program issue in one second.  Using an MSDOS version
of BASICA under MSDOS 6.0 running on an AMD 386 DX 40 with turbo on, I wrote 
the following program, called "TICK.BAS":

110 REM FIRST START WITH A NEW SECOND
120 T1$=TIME$
130 IF T1$=TIME$ THEN 130
135 REM NOW COUNT NUMBER OF ACTIONS IN ONE SECOND
140 J = 0 : T1$=TIME$ : D1$=DATE$
150 T$=TIME$ : D$=DATE$
160 J = J+1 : IF T$=TIME$ THEN 160
170 PRINT J

When I ran this program, twice, the printed result was:

3023

Basica typically isn't fast, yet in one second, this program, running in
Interpreted basic, issued 3023 date and time requests.  Actually, it
issued 3023 date requests and 6046 time requests.  This means that, for
example, on a computer such as mine, it has to be issuing a request for
the date and the time during the 1/3023rd of one second between the last
second of one day and the first second of the next.  If there is even
2/3023rds of a second before midnight, there would be enough time to get
both date and time in the same second: 

A#=1/3023 : PRINT USING "##.##########";A#
0.0003307972

Or a 3 in 10,000 chance of this happening in the cases of someone running 
a program in Basic which would hit within the time required to cause an 
error of this type.  And in a compiled language the chance is even less 
since the time to do two MSDOS calls.  

Using Turbo Pascal 6, I wrote the following file called "TICK.PAS":

uses dos;
var yr,mo,day,dow,
    hr,min,sec,tick,
    hr2,min2,sec2,tick2:word;
    I:longint;
 
BEGIN
   getdate(yr,mo,day,dow);
   gettime(hr,min,sec,tick);
   repeat
       gettime(hr2,min2,sec2,tick2);
   until sec2&lt;&gt;sec;
   I := 0;
   repeat
       gettime(hr,min,sec,tick);
       inc(i);
   until sec &lt;&gt; sec2;
   writeln(i:1);
end.

The results I got for this were: 6767, 6229, 6229, 6575, 6571, 6201, 
6205, 6202, 6228, 6575, 6229, 6228, 6229, 6574, 6229, 6575, 6229, 6571.

Figuring worst case at 6200 tests, it means that there would have to be 
less than 2/6200 of one second before midnight for the possibility of 
this happening.  1/6200 of one second means that if a program of this 
type was executed every day in such a manner as to cross midnight, during 
the moment the date and time were collected, the chances are an error of 
this type happening would strike one execution every 16.9 years, since 
it can only happen once a day, and it can only happen during the 1/6200 
of a second before midnight.

No wonder I never thought about such a thing.  It may be crass to put it
this way, but how many people worry about an error that *might* happen
once every 16.9 years?

As too many people have informed me, in regards to the message regarding
dates and times, Unix (and the C language) return the number of seconds
since 1970 as the date field.

  [... and POSIX and Standard C systems, etc.  This was noted, in many
  messages NOT included in RISKS, including those by (among others),

  Just for kicks, I surveyed the 30 messages that were candidates for
  this issue, and 10 of the DATE: fields had two-character fields.  PGN]

Someone else informed me that under VM, one can issue a form of the DIAG
instruction and get the time since a certain epoch.  (There is an issue
here which the person who pointed it out to me may be unaware of;  DIAG is
a privileged instruction if you were running under anything EXCEPT VM, so
the only place you can use that instruction is for stuff that runs in
machine emulation.)

Someone else informed me that in assembly language on a Decsystem 20, you 
can get the date and the time in a single call.  I neved used assembly on 
a DEC 20, so I was unaware of this.

Someone else pointed out that my comparison on a 386 DX 40 isn't quite the
same as conditions on other computer systems because a 386/40 is a
relatively recent development in what is available for the average person,
e.g. the old mainframe computers used to only accept batch jobs and a job
might take hours or {days} to run.  I remember my days of punching jobs on
cards some twelve or fifteen years ago, and waiting 20 minutes to 1/2 an
hour for a job to complete.  Cheap terminal access made card punch access
obsolete.

I just wanted to point out that this system of time storage will differ
from World Time (UTC) by the number of leap seconds prior to the stored
time.  Currently this is 10 or 11 seconds.  The most recent leap second
was added the end of June 94.  I expect that most non-real-time
applications don't care about 10+ seconds.  However it's interesting to
note that the internal storage is in milliseconds.  This difference can 
become quite critical in real-time applications.

&gt;This sort of issue pops up so rarely that it's not something one thinks
&gt;about much.  In fact, a lot of reports print date only, so the time doesn't
&gt;matter one way or the other.

And this is exactly why we discuss this sort of issue in RISKS: because
people don't think about this sort of issue much.  As a buyer of computing
services, are you happy to have a bug report answered with "Aw, that almost
never happens!"?  Or maybe "Nobody cared much thirty years ago; why worry
now?"

In a recent RISKS, Paul Robinson makes two points I'd like to disagree with.

The first is minor.  Mr. Robinson lists a variety of operating systems, all of
which he says return the date and time separately, thus leaving programs open
to the danger that, if they sample across a midnight boundary, they may get
a time from one day and a date from another.  All the OS's he lists are rather
old.  All versions of Unix since the very beginning have returned, on request,
a unified date/time value, represented as the number of seconds since a fixed
time (in 1970).  Even the usual ASCII converted date/time routine returns a
string containing both time and date.

Similarly, VMS, since it was first introduced, has used a unified date/time
value, this time a (64-bit) value indicating 100-nanosecond "ticks" since a
fixed time (in 1858).

While I don't have the appropriate documentation here to check, I'd bet that
such recent designed systems as Windows NT and OS/2 also use a combined
offset.

He is right about MSDOS, however.  Once a toy, always a toy.

The second point is more significant, even if the particular application is
trivial.  He points out that the problem can only arise if the program happens
to execute the first of the call in a short period of time just before mid-
night - a period determined by the time needed to issue the two calls one
after another.  He estimates, then measures, this interval, and computes the
fraction of 24 hours that it represents.  This fraction he claims is the
probability of seeing the bug.

Probabilistic arguments can sound very convincing, but are all too often very
poorly made - so poorly made as to be essentially meaningless.  This argument
is an example of that class.  What Mr. Robinson has calculated is the proba-
bility that a program which runs at times evenly distributed throughout the
day will happen to get caught by such a bug.  However, I submit that there are
almost no programs with this property.  Many programs are much more likely to
run during the day than near midnight; many never run at midnight at all.
They will have essentially no chance of seeing a problem.  On the other hand,
there exist programs that regularly run near midnight - programs that roll
files over for the new day, for example.  Their probability of seeing the
problem are much, much higher - though without more information, it's impos-
sible to estimate the real probability.

Probabilistic arguments look strong because they look so objective.  However,
there's often a great deal of subjectivity in estimating the underlying dis-
tributions on which the calculations are based.  We need only recall the
orders of magnitude that distinguished the Intel and IBM estimates of the
probability of running into the Pentium divide bug.  Intel assumed the divi-
sors and dividends were chosen at random from all possible 64-bit values.  IBM
made various assumptions, such as that the divisors and dividends were the
best representations of numbers that, in decimal, had one digit before and
two digits after the decimal point.  There are completely different distribu-
tions, and the resulting "objectively calculated" probabilities are wildly
different.  Which is "right"?  Both, and neither.  Both correctly describe a
possible use of a Pentium.  Neither exactly describes any likely real set of
calculations performed by any real Pentium user.  Which one is more useful?
Ah, well that all depends on what you are trying to do.

Finally, I'll point out that the underlying problem - of accurately reading a
field that cannot be accessed atomically - recurs at multiple levels.  Many
contemporary chips provide a 64-bit hardware-updated clock, but can only
access its value 32 bits at a time.  Reading such a clock requires care!
Leslie Lamport published an algorithm a couple of years back - essentially
the trick that others have mentioned, of reading high order, then low order,
then high order again, and retrying if the high order bits changed - that can
be proved to get the correct time without requiring interlocking.  The proof
is non-trivial.
							-- Jerry

  [And don't forget the delightful old SRI stuff, which Lamport, Shostak,
  Pease, Rushby, and others have contributed to, showing that the
  old-faithful three-clock fault-tolerant algorithms do not work under
  Byzantine fault modes; you need FOUR clocks!  PGN]

  Fred Ballard pointed out the risk of a COBOL program running near midnight...

I used it in 1969 in assembly code written under ITS, which had separate
Date and Time calls.  I think I read about it in Datamation.

At the hardware level, the manual for the IBM 360 discussed (in 1965) the
64-bit clock, a new feature of the architecture.  The clock was represented
as two 32bit words in memory, and was automatically updated by the hardware,
every X microseconds.  The application programmer might read the clock value
while the hardware was propagating a carry to the high word, and the program
would see mismatched upper &amp; lower data.  The manual promised that, if you
used a certain Move instruction to read the clock, the hardware would hold
off clock ticks while the Move completed.  Moreover, the same promise applied
if you were Moving a new value into the clock memory.

This problem's been around a long time.

I have to interpret this line of reasoning as having been intended to draw
flames--if not by Mr. Robinson, then by our beloved editor/moderator.  I can
make the Pentium analogy as well as most folks, and this one is far easier
to understand.

One of the big reasons for the RISKS list effort is to allow us to
understand what we're buying in to when we allow machines to do our work for
us.  To the extent that we trust machines to do the right thing, we had
better see to it that they do.  To the extent that we cannot trust such
machines, we need to be aware of the likelihood of problems, and adjust our
trust accordingly.

There are so many time-based calculations going on all the time, that it
boggles the mind to imagine the impact of this carelessness.  So many of
these calculations are embedded so deeply that you'll never bother to
verify them.

So what if you're charged for another day of rent, even for an expensive
object?  So what if you're charged another day's interest on money?  Or
so what if it happens, as long as it's not likely to happen to you but
rather to somebody else? 

(What is wrong with this attitude?)

I'm reminded of a story told me by a buddy some time around 1974, wherein he
had labored hard and long to isolate the cause of a machine freeze-up that
hit his timesharing system (a Sigma, I think) once every few days.  He had
finally traced the problem to a race condition that would have been solved
by inverting the order of two machine instructions.  Upon reporting this to
the manufacturer's engineers, they answered with ``but that problem will
almost never happen, so it's not worth fixing,'' regardless of the periodic
machine freezes that it had in fact caused.

A lot of Pentium users were pretty upset about a bug that was purported
to turn up only every 27,000 years.  Paul's blase attitude about this
problem is particularly ironic in light of the fact that his BASIC
benchmark program contained a bug:

Once ever 16.9 years *per computer*.  That means that with just 17
computers, the error *might* occur once per year.  17000 computers, and it's
probably happening once a day somewhere in the world.  Obviously it's not,
though, otherwise we would've heard about it sooner, but that's not the
point.

The point is program correctness.  This is a trivial problem to fix, and so
it should be fixed.  The low probability of it happening will be little
consolation when your VISA card gets 2 months worth of interest rather than
just 1, or the life support system issues an overdose because it finds a
discrepancy of 86,399 seconds between two readings occurring 1 second apart,
at midnight.

IBM's MVS and its predecessors (at least for the last 20-25 years) have always
returned the date and time in a single system call.  Whether the COBOL
compiler has made that information available in one call is another question.
But when the system's TIME service is used, you can get both the time and the
date with one invocation.

Paul further detailed some experiments he ran to see how severe the problem
might be of having a program running that makes two requests, one just
before midnight and the other just after midnight.  His conclusion, for a
program written in Pascal, was that:

&gt; ... but how many people worry about an error that *might* happen
&gt;once every 16.9 years?

I'm afraid this conclusion ignores the multi-programming aspects of today's
systems.  When multiple programs are running, one program may be suspended
by the operating system to service a program with a higher priority.  It's
conceivable that a program might be suspended for several seconds (or even
minutes if it has a very low priority and the system is running many
programs of higher priority) such that the first request could occur well
before midnight, then the program would be suspended until after midnight.

You're using a reasonably modern PC, which is, relatively speaking, a really
fast machine.  I've used timesharing machines which were so overloaded that
simple jobs took hours.  I wouldn't be at all surprised to find out that
seconds or even minutes elapsed between "consecutive" date and time
requests.  This is still unlikely, but I wouldn't stake my million-dollar
application on it.

1/6200 is also substantially more likely than the 1/10^9 which is
often cited for "critical" applications.

The Rexx programming language includes separate built-in functions for
obtaining the date and time.  However, the defined semantics for these is
that the first call to either within a clause (informally: statement) causes
a record to be made which is then used for ALL calls to these functions
within that clause.  Hence, if multiple calls to DATE and/or TIME are made
in a single clause, they are guaranteed to be consistent with one another.

Paul Robinson suggested in <A HREF="/Risks/16.70.html">RISKS-16.70</A> that COBOL has separate statements
for getting the date and time "[b]ecause most operating systems separate the
request for time from the request for date".

To me, this indicates that most operating systems have not been designed
with reliability in mind (or if they have, then they are buggy in this
regard).  One example of an operating system that does provide the date and
time of day in a single call is Unix; it's interface has been copied to the
C language.  Even when the operating system does not provide an atomic time
call, it's not a good idea for a language to _mandate_ the split calls,
since this always puts the burden on the language user.  In C, for instance,
if the operating system does not support an atomic call, the time() function
can hide this by using a "do { get date1; get time; get date2; } while
(date1 != date2);" loop as suggested by an earlier RISKS entry.  The C
programmer then gets an atomic operation anyway.  This is the approach to
take for all systems and languages, and I'm glad to hear the COBOL now does
take it.

In addition to the race condition introduced by separate date and time of
day calls in an operating system, remember that if the operating system
returns the date, then it must know something of calendars.  A very simple
understanding of the Gregorian calendar is simple to code (one needs a table
containing the lengths of months, and a simple formula that tells whether a
year is a leap year).  Even so, there are a lot of programs that can't
handle it correctly.  A more complete understanding of calendars in general
(not just the Gregorian one) would need a lot more code, which is better
kept outside the kernel.  I think the Unix design, where the kernel keeps
track of some universal time and the programs convert this into dates and
local time as they wish, is the best solution.

One more example: ICL's VME provides them.

Surely that's the whole point about RISKS: Yes, it mayn't happen very often,
but will do so and in safety critical situations will probably do so at the
most dangerous time. (Sodd's law aka Murphy's law)

Anyway, Mr Robinson's analysis overlooks one important fact - jobs do not
always run randomly. If I set a job to start at 5 minutes to midnight to do
some housekeeping or such and it tends to run for 4 min 59.9 secs +/- 0.1
sec before reading the date and time it is probably much more likely to fall
over this problem than if I set it off to run randomly after I go home. It's
a problem with reliability calculations - they tend to assume life is
random!

The Unix gettimeofday() and AmigaDOS CurrentTime() calls return both time
and date.  Both these systems combine time and date into a single 32-bit
number (which has other problems, which I'll get to later).

He then goes on to estimate the probability of a time/date rollover error
by running tests on GW-BASIC on a MS-DOS machine.  This environment allows
reasonably well-controlled execution time behavior.  In contrast, heavily
loaded Unix systems short on real memory may swap your program out between
the time and date instructions, leading to a window of vulnerability much
larger than the 1/3023 s window that he gives.

Unix isn't completely off the hook.  Most systems use a signed integer for
time/date values.  The highest value that can be stored in such an integer
is 2^31-1, which corresponds to Mon Jan 18 22:14:07 2038 EST.  So Unix gives
us another 38 years.

From the start, the UNIX concept of time has been the elapsed time since
January 1, 1970, the "UNIX system time".  Any UNIX program which needs to
get the current time or the current date from the system does so by first
asking for the UNIX system time (using time(3) (time(2) on older systems) or
gettimeofday(2) and then using a UNIX library function to convert it into
the appropriate human-interpretable data (current date, current time, etc.).
The operation of getting the UNIX system time is atomic, and always has
been.

Just so that people don't think I'm claiming that UNIX was the first to get
this right, I'll point out that Multics had similar functionality -- a
function for getting the current system time as a 72-bit binary number,
functions for converting that number into human-readable representations,
and a function for converting a human-readable date string into such a
72-bit binary number.

Just so that people don't think I'm claiming that no one has gotten it
right since UNIX, I'll point out that MacOS uses the same concepts,
although it has the different problem of assuming that the system time
is always local time (i.e., it has no concept of time zones).

The fact that the current date and the current time are intertwined
and should not be treated separately by an operating system trying to
achieve reliability is not new knowledge, and the technology to "do it
right" is not new technology.  Just because COBOL and DOS got it wrong
doesn't mean that we should live with it being done wrong.

Regarding Fred Ballard's suggestion of bracketing the time of day inquiry
between two date inquiries.

In the various large organizations I have worked for I have never seen a
"production" "batch" program that relies on the system date for any
processing decisions or calculations.  Nearly all programs use a "run date"
which is entered as a parameter or is in a common file read by all programs
that need a date.

Besides addressing the "after midnight" problem it also allows retroactive
processing when problems happen or anticipatory runs to spread out workloads
or compensate for postal delays.

Of course there is the problem of entering the wrong control date. A clever
approach is to utilize the system date as a reasonableness check on the
entered control date (this would be especially likely to catch the common
error we all commit of not incrementing the year digits in our head until
sometime in February :) )

As we replace these old systems with real time client-server
systems then the use of system date and time becomes more
enticing - but then we confront the headache of which clock to
use on a network of processors.

Also a potential risk in relying on programming language
facilities that return the date and time in a single request -
how do we know that the language implementors have applied Fred
Ballard's carefulness to the extraction - as Paul Robinson points
out: most of the underlying operating systems would require
separate calls.

[...]

Paul is missing one of the basic lessons of RISKS (even though he states the
source of the problem): the coupling of seemingly unrelated events.  The
probability distribution of the time of day at which jobs run is not flat.
There are a LOT of batch jobs out there in the world that run automatically
at "midnight."  This bug will almost certainly occur eventually, probably
already has, and with a frequency much higher than once every 16.9 years.
Maybe it will even happen on the A320 he is flying in...

MS-DOS certainly has the problem, but OS/360 and its successors (including
MVS) don't.  I can't speak for the other systems cited.

In the OS/360 world, the time and date have always been available in the
single operating system call SVC 11 (optionally through the TIME macro).
Time is returned in GPR0; date in GPR1.  Optionally, on S/370 and later
systems the program can use the SVC 11 call to obtain the 64-bit TOD clock
and do its own conversion to date-and-time.  (The TOD clock, maintained by
the hardware, gives time from 0000 hours 1 January 1900 and is the datum
from which all time and date information on the system are derived.)

Of course, none of this makes any difference if the language in use doesn't
provide a mechanism for the application to retrieve both time and date
returned by the same OS invocation.

As much as the various contributors who have worked to show that the chances
of a problem with the time/date at midnight are less than 1 in 10*6 in any
one day, I am afraid that if one was depending on the software to fly a 747,
that would not be a great comfort!

However I have seen a wonder example of such a problem with a large VAX
cluster of six machines. The batch subsystem and job controller runs on all
the CPUs. Jobs set to run at midnight will be started by the first machine
to reach midnight and to schedule the job. However the job may well not run
on that machine, but on another. If the clocks are not in step and they
_never_ are, that machine may resubmit the job to run the next midnight. The
result - well as opposed to one job running once at midnight, you can end up
with lots of them and unless the code handles this, the data files can
become interesting. As machines get faster, the jobs can run quicker, so the
window for such a problem becomes more significant. With an old 11/750,
getting the job to start might take seconds, while a 6660 it might take less
than 1/100th of a second. So with the 11/750 cluster. the clocks can be a
few seconds adrift, while with 6660's, that margin is much smaller.

There was a big flap recently over Fidelity's Magellan fund estimating in
November that they would make a $4.32/share distribution at the end of year,
and then not doing so.  A letter of explanation was sent to the shareholders
(including me) from J. Gary Burkhead, the President of Fidelity, including
the following pertinent items:

"During the estimating process, a tax accountant is required to transcribe
the net realized gain or loss from the fund's financial records (which were
correct at all times) to a separate spreadsheet, where additional
calculations are performed.  The error occurred when the accountant omitted
the minus sign on a net capital loss of $1.3 billion and incorrectly treated
it as a net capital gain on this separate spreadsheet.  This meant that the
dividend estimate spreadsheet was off by $2.6 billion....

"Some people have asked how, in this age of technology, such a mistake could
be made.  While many of our processes are computerized, the requirements of
the tax code are complex and dictate that some steps be handled manually by
our tax managers and accountants, and people can make mistakes.  The error
in this case was not caught in the initial review, but was detected in our
normal process--which includes a review by outside auditors--as we prepared
to make the actual distribution calculation.

"We have taken several steps designed to ensure that this error should not
happen again.  We will subject initial estimates to the same rigorous
verification process that we use in preparing the distributions that the
funds actually pay.  This will include a thorough review not only by our own
fund accountants by also by the fund's treasurer and independent auditors.
In addition, estimates will be reviewed by each fund's portfolio manager."

I'm still not clear as to exactly why a spreadsheet or other program
couldn't be developed to make the estimation calculation, since the problem
seems to have been a transcription error and not a failure to understand the
complexities of the tax code.  It also occurred to me to wonder what sort of
testing the software they do use undergoes, and whether those procedures
will also be upgraded in the wake of this mistake.  

I see two RISKS: The implication that this mistake only happened because
manual steps were involved, and the risk of having infrequent but highly
important tasks that require non-standard procedures (like "manual"
calculations in a largely computerized environment).

   American Statesman*, p D8 (omitted here), with the following comment.  PGN]

Even after reading risks all these years, I am still amazed that these kind
of errors can slip by.  The last time I entered a $1.3 billion check as a
deposit in my checkbook, it was only a short time before I was bouncing
checks left and right.  It also was quite apparent when I balanced my check
book at the end of the month.

&gt;From the January 4, 1995 Albuquerque Tribune front page:

Hello? Hello? Phones go haywire in Roundhouse

  Your state government has been disconnected. Please check the
number and call again some other time.
  As if Gov. Gary Johnson's call for the mass resignation of about
350 state officials weren't enough to confuse citizens in search of
bureaucrats, the state's phone system on Tuesday began to arbitrarily
shifting many 827-prefix calls to an erroneous recording that declared
the number was not in service.
  The 827 prefix is state government's main prefix in Santa Fe.
  "I'm quite uncomfortable about the current situation," John Dawson,
deputy director of the state Office of Communications, said Tuesday.
"It's manifesting itself very seriously today for some reason. But
I'm hopeful that it will be over in the next 24 hours."
  Dawson said a glitch in the software that controls the state office
phone system was at fault for the complications.  He said it appeared
to be affecting only Santa Fe offices with the 827 prefix.
  The state was aware of the computer problem a year ago, and removed
the software because of it, he said.  But two weeks ago the state
allowed its contractor, Fijitsu Business Communication Systems, to
reinstall the software because the glitch supposedly had been removed."


The article went on to describe the confusion, and the fact that our new
governor was not getting calls.  As might be expected, this happened right
when a new administration was moving in to Santa Fe. So, if it was broken
once, try to break it again at the most critical time possible. Sigh...

  [A longer message from Tim is floating around the well.  This one seems
  quite succinct, and helps to clarify further the situation discussed in
  <A HREF="/Risks/16.69.html">RISKS-16.69</A> and .70.  PGN]

Because the RISKS list gets pretty wide distribution, I wanted you to know
that the original posting contains some pretty serious misinterpretation of
a messy situation.  Briefly,

- CompuServe is asserting no proprietary rights in the GIF spec, and couldn't
even if we wanted to, since it has long been openly published.

- The LZW algorithm was incorporated from an open publication, and without
knowledge that Unisys was pursuing a patent.  The patent was brought to our
attention, much to our displeasure, after the GIF spec had been published and
passed into wide use.

- We found it necessary to take a license to the patent from Unisys, and
since a number of our developers had used GIF in good faith, we also
negotiated a pass-through license for their benefit.  Clawson has
distributed parts of this license, with a poor interpretation, outside of
its original context, which was to developers of CompuServe-related products
alone.  GIF is included in this license because we are unable to pass
through a general license to practice LZW.

- It is not the intent of CompuServe to attempt to enforce proprietary
rights in GIF against users or developers, including those of Web
technology.  We cannot and do not speak for Unisys' intent in this matter.

- Having and transmitting GIF images is not an infringement of the patent,
since 'practicing' LZW means running code which accomplishes the compression
of the graphics.

The recently announced patent restriction by UNISYS/COMPUSERVE on the
use of GIF files poses a potentially serious problem. The Internet
community needs to protect itself from such arbitrary constraints by
establishing a new public domain standard for graphics interchange.

This standard needs to:

1) Be compact
2) Decode fast
3) Be free from patent/copyright restrictions
4) Be rapidly available

JPEG is certainly a candidate as it is a public standard. The only
drawback is the slow decoding time.

However there is an alternative based on existing 'standards'
that should give similar performance to GIF files.
We can do this by:

a) Representing the picture using the Portable Bit Map (PBM) format

b) Compressing using the Free Software Foundation GZIP method.

I have being trying this idea out to see if the performance is OK.
Unfortunately I do not have PBM support on my machine, but I have
been testing the approach using the Windows bitmap format (BMP).
The tests were done on an PC 386/DX33 machine using 8 bit (256 color)
files. The GIF and JPEG measurements were based on the LVIEW 3.1
public domain graphics package. Standalone DOS GZIP and PKZIP v1.1 packages
were used for the other measurements.

Results:

Test file Cathedra.bmp

Format	Size (bytes)       Encode (secs)      Decode (secs)

BMP     307,994                -                  -
ZIP     185,866               14                  6
GZ      173,314               15                  6

GIF     197,548                8                  9
JPEG     56,167               25                 30


Test file simba.bmp

Format	Size (bytes)       Encode (secs)      Decode (secs)

BMP     265,398                -                  -
ZIP     109,760               15                  5
GZ       99,748               14                  4

GIF     113,895                9                  8
JPEG     34,638               21                 20

Assuming that BMP and PBM formats are of similar size, it would seem that a
compressed PBM file format (GZF?) has advantages over the equivalent GIF
file since it is smaller and decodes faster. The encoding time is slower -
but this is a 'one-off' operation so it is not too important.

It is also interesting to note that GZIP gives better compression than my
rather elderly V1.1 version of PKZIP, and I think that GZIP will stand up
pretty well against current compression methods such as those in PKZIP 2.04.

I hope this starts a useful debate on defining a 'rapid hack' to provide a
substitute for GIF format files.

Obviously it is important that we get something that people are happy with -
but quickly. One option is to set up a forum of current GIF providers and
users who would hammer out a new format.  The other more direct (and rapid)
approach is to nominate a volunteer to define the format and provide the C
sources so that the new format can be readily incorporated into existing
graphics tools.

The obvious choice here is the Free Software Foundation.  It is part of
their remit to provide good quality free software, and they are the authors
of GZIP, so they should be in a good position to define the format and
publish it via the usual GNU distribution channels (together with a GIF to
GZF converter).

Along with the historical-interest postings on hardware math errors, it may
be interesting also to consider software math errors.  Here's one:

The built-in BASIC on the TI 99/4A computer uses a certain shortcut for
boolean calculations: it uses * for and and + for or.  Operations such as "&gt;"
return numeric values, and the IF statement tests for zero or non-zero.
Here's the problem: the 'numeric values' mentioned above are 0 for false,
and -1 for true.
 So `` 10 IF (((1 &gt; 0) * (1 &gt; 0)) + (1 &gt; 0)) PRINT "It Works" ''  won't print
anything, since -1 * -1 is 1, and 1 + -1 is 0.

While resolving a problem involving interactions of multiple systems we
found we had a set of failure conditions which had a very low probability of
happening, lacked any work around or avoidance strategies, and had very
unexpected results when one occurred.  We gave the name "Rutherford Effect"
to such situations.

The reason for the name "Rutherford Effect" comes from the experiment
Rutherford and two of his students, Geiger and Mardsen did.  They made a
beam of particles project onto a thin metal foil.  Most particles when
through with no problem.  However, a few hit the nucleus in of a atom in the
foil and bounced back.  According to legend, Rutherford said, "I would not
have been more surprised if I had shot a cannon ball at tissue paper and it
bounced back."  The similarity of a computer mostly working but having a
very small number of unpredictable and unavoidable failures inspired us to
say it suffered from a "Rutherford Effect".

The Pentium also suffers from a Rutherford Effect.

The excerpt from the _Wall Street Journal_ about this incident reproduced in
<A HREF="/Risks/16.67.html">RISKS-16.67</A> is inaccurate.

This incident involved Michael Wolff posting nearly 150 virtually identical
messages to different newsgroups.  (Actions of this kind are called
"spamming", where "spam" is defined as the posting of 20 or more
substantially identical messages to Usenet.  The content of these messages
is irrelevant.)  These messages were cancelled by Cancelmoose.

After the cancellation, the issue of these messages was discussed at
length in alt.current-events.net-abuse, and a vote was taken, which
was overwhelmingly in favour of the cancellation.  There was nothing
special about the Wolff postings; all mass postings to Usenet that fit
the criteria of spam are cancelled.

Cancelmoose is not a "vigilante", as he does not act alone; there is
substantial agreement amongst the Usenet administrators that have
contributed to this debate that these actions are necessary.

Wolff claims to be an expert on the Internet; if this were true he
shouldn't have been "stunned and amazed" by the response.

Cellular phones, when powered up, periodically transmit to the nearest cell,
even when someone is not talking on them.  For soldiers, that represents a
risk that enemy troops will be able to locate them using direction- finding
equipment and attack them, or call in artillery fire or air strikes on their
position.  That, I presume, is why the Israeli command structure is
concerned about their troops carrying cell phones - and should be -
notwithstanding the issue of time being spent on non-military tasks.

Actually, there was (and perhaps still is) such a product for the Apple
Macintosh called LifeGuard.

It was reviewed in the February 1991 issue of _MacUser_ magazine. According
to the reviewer, the memory-resident program produced an audible and visual
alarm on the Mac after a length of time that the user specifies. It then
reminded the user to take a break:

  "You control the frequency of breaks as well as the interval allowed before
  it's time to resume work."

It also provided the user with a "snooze" function to temporarily override
the alarm. It even offers suggestions for exercises and basic information on
ergonomics, according to the reviewer.

LifeGuard's  publisher was Visionary Software, Inc., P.O. Box 69447,
Portland, OR 97201 (800-877-1832 or 503-246-6200). I have never actually
seen the product, just read the review. I wonder if it caught on and
whether it is still available today (version 1.0 was reviewed).

Such things already exist.  Coffee Break, a program for the Mac by Thomas
Reed, was written to help reduce repetitive stress injuries.  It allows you
to set how much time you want to work between breaks and how long your
breaks should be.  It will then come to the foreground when you have
exhausted your work time and will not relinquish control of your computer
until after the break time has passed.  I haven't used the program myself
and can't speak in any detail about its features.  It is available from the
typical Mac ftp sites (I downloaded it from the umich archives:
/mac/util/organization/coffeebreak1.1.sit.hqx.)

   Leslie Lamport published an algorithm a couple of years back - essentially
   the trick that others have mentioned, of reading high order, then low order,
   then high order again, and retrying if the high order bits changed - that

   The proof is non-trivial.

  [This is admittedly a bit long, but I thought this experience might be of
  some interest to RISKS readers.  -matt]
    [Matt, Struggling as we are with export controls in the NRC crypto
    policy review, this is quite interesting.  Thanks.  PGN]

Under an obscure provision of US law, devices and computer programs
that use encryption techniques to hide information from prying eyes
and ears are considered ``munitions'' and subject to the same rules
that govern the international arms trade.  In particular, taking such
items out of this country requires the approval of the State
Department, which decides whether exporting something might endanger
national security.  In the past, these restrictions were of little
concern to the average citizen; encryption found most of its
application in military and diplomatic communications equipment.
Today, however, growing concern over electronic fraud and privacy
means that encryption techniques are starting to find their way into
more conventional commercial products like laptop computers and
portable phones.

Mostly to find out what the process was like, I recently applied for a
temporary export license for a portable telephone encryption product
that I wanted to take with me on a business trip to England and
Belgium.

The item in question is more properly called a ``telephone security
device.''  This is a little box that scrambles telephone conversations
to protect them against eavesdroppers; this sort of protection is
sometimes important when discussing confidential business matters from
faraway places.  The particular model I bought was already approved
for export; it employs a cipher algorithm that the government has
already decided is not a threat to national security even should it
fall into the hands of some rogue government.  This model is aimed
primarily, I presume, at international business travelers who want to
communicate in a reasonably secure manner with their home offices in
the states.  In other words, a typical user buys two of them, leaving
one at the home office and carrying the other when traveling abroad.
The options that came with my device included a James Bond-ish looking
acoustic coupler and handset to facilitate its connection to the
hardwired phones that are still common in European hotel rooms.

It turns out that there was recently some discussion in the government
about exempting products like my secure phone from the licensing
paperwork requirements.  Unfortunately, however, this exemption never
actually took effect.  So even though the device I had was already
approved for sale abroad, I still needed to get a temporary export
license before I could take it with me.  But I was assured that ``this
is an easy, routine process''.  Well, sure enough, about two weeks
before I was to leave I got back my official US State Department
``license for the temporary export of unclassified defense articles''.
So far, so good.

&gt;From what I was able to figure out by reading the license (and having
a few conversations with an export lawyer), I'm required to leave from
an international airport with a Customs agent present (no problem
there, although Customs is geared to arriving, rather than departing,
travelers).  At the airport, I'm supposed to fill out a form called a
``shipper's export declaration'' (SED) on which I have to declare that
``these commodities are authorized by the US government for export
only to Belgium and the United Kingdom.  They may not be resold,
transshipped, or otherwise disposed of in any country, either in their
original form or incorporated into other end-items without the prior
written approval of the US Department of State''.  Then I'm to present
the SED and export license to a Customs official at the airport before
I leave.  The Customs officer is supposed to take my SED and endorse
my license to show what I'm actually taking out of the country.

On the way back in, I'm supposed to ``declare'' my item at Customs
(even though it was manufactured in the US) and show them my license,
and they're supposed to endorse the license again as proof that I
have, in fact, returned the ``defense article'' to the safety of the
United States.

The first hitch I ran into was that no one could actually tell me
where I could get an SED form.  But when I called Customs they assured
me that this was no big deal.  ``Just come by when you get to the
airport and we stamp the license.  I guess you can just fill out the
SED there,'' they said.

I made sure to get to the airport early anyway.

Although there was moderately heavy traffic near the airport, I made
it to JFK two and a half hours before my 10pm flight.  I was flying
United, which has their own terminal at JFK, so Customs has an office
right there in the same building from which I was to depart (JFK is
awful to get around, so I was glad for this).  I checked in for my
flight (and got upgraded to first class, which bolstered my
expectation that everything was going to be really easy from here on).
Then, luggage, license and phone in hand, I made my way downstairs to
Customs, expecting to fill out the SED form and ``just have my license
stamped'' as they had assured me earlier on the telephone.  I
explained my situation to the security guard who controls entry to the
Customs area, and he led me to ``the back office'' without much
argument or delay.  The head uniformed Customs guy in the back office
(which I think is same office where they take the people suspected of
being ``drug mules'' with cocaine-filled condoms in their stomaches)
looked approachable enough.  He had a sort of kindly, grandfatherly
manner, and he was playing a video game on a laptop computer.  I got
the impression that most of the people he encounters are suspected
drug smugglers, and he seemed pleased enough to be dealing with
something a little different from the norm.  When I explained what I
was doing he looked at me as if I had just announced that I was a
citizen of Mars who hadn't even bothered to obtain a visa.

He explained, carefully, that a) I really do need the SED form; b) not
only that, I should have already filled it out, in duplicate; c) he
doesn't have blank SED forms; d) he, like everyone else in the entire
US government that I had spoken to, has no idea where one gets them
from, but people must get them from somewhere; and e) it doesn't
really matter, because I'm in the wrong place anyway.

I asked him where the right place is.  ``The cargo building, of
course,'' he told me, patiently.  I remembered the cargo building
because I passed it in the taxi just as the traffic jam began, about
half an hour before I got to the United terminal.  The airport shuttle
bus doesn't stop there.  I'd have to call a taxi.  ``But I think
they're closed now, and even if they were open you'd never make it
before your flight'' he helpfully added, saving me the trip.  He also
complemented me for going to the trouble to get the license.

I must have looked hurt and confused.  Eventually he called in some
fellow in a suit who I presume to have been his boss.

``Are you the guy who wants to export the fancy gun?'' the fellow in
the suit asked me.

``It's not a gun, it's a telephone,'' I responded, with a straight
face.

``Why do you have a license to export a telephone?''  Good question, I
thought.  I explained about the export law and showed him the thing.
He agreed that it looked pretty harmless.

The fellow in the suit reiterated points a through e almost verbatim
(do they rehearse for these things?) and explained that this isn't
really their department, since my license was issued by the State
Department, not Customs, and my situation doesn't come up very often
because exports usually go via the cargo building.  He'd love to help
me, but the computer in which these things get entered is over in
Cargo.  ``That's how the records get made.  But you do have a valid
license, which is nice.''  He also suggested that I would have had an
easier time had I shipped the device instead of carrying it with me.

I asked what I should do, given that my plane was scheduled to leave
in less than an hour.  Neither was sure, but the fellow in the suit
seemed willing leave it to the discretion of the uniformed guy.  ``How
does this thing work, anyway?'' he asked.  I explained as best as I
could, trying to make it sound as harmless as it is.  ``You mean like
that Clipper chip?'' he asked.

At this point, given that he has a computer and knows something about
the Clipper chip, I figured that maybe there was some hope of making
my flight.  Or maybe I was about to spend the night in jail.  In my
mind, I put it at about a 90:10 hope:jail ratio.

Then he asked, ``Do you know about this stuff?''

So we chatted about computers and cryptography for a while.  Finally,
the two of them decided that it wouldn't really hurt for them to just
sign the form as long as I promised to call my lawyer and get the SED
situation straightened out ASAP.  They assured me that I won't be
arrested or have any other trouble upon my return.

I made my flight, validated license in hand.

An aside: Throughout my trip, I discovered an interesting thing about
the phone and the various options I was carrying with it.  Under X-ray
examination, it looks just like some kind of bomb.  (I suspect it was
the coiled handset cords).  Every time I went through a security
checkpoint, I had to dig the thing out of my luggage and show it to
the guard.  I almost missed the new ``Eurostar'' chunnel train (3hrs
15mins nonstop from London to Brussels, airport-style checkin and
security) as the guards were trying to figure out whether my telephone
was likely to explode.

Coming back to the US was less eventful, though it did take me an
extra hour or so to get through Customs.  Expecting a bit of a hassle
I didn't check any luggage and made sure to be the first person from
my flight to reach the Customs line.  The inspector was ready to
wordlessly accept my declaration form and send me on my way when I
opened my mouth and explained that I needed to get an export license
stamped.  That was obviously a new one for him.  He finally decided
that this had to be handled by something called the ``Ships Office''.
I was sent to an unoccupied back room (a different back room from
before) and told to wait.  I thought about the recent Customs
experiences of Phil Zimmermann.  (Zimmermann, the author of a popular
computer encryption program, was recently detained, questioned and
searched by Customs officials investigating whether he violated the
same regulations I was trying so hard to follow.)  After about half an
hour, an officer came in and asked me what I needed.  I explained
about my export license that had to be endorsed.  She just shrugged
and told me that she had to ``process the flight'' first.  As best as
I could tell, her job was to clear the airplane itself through
Customs, that being, technically speaking, a very expensive import.
It would take a little while.  She was pleasant enough, though, and at
least didn't look at me as if she intended to send me to jail or have
me strip searched.

Finally, she finished with the plane and asked me for my form.  She
studied it carefully, obviously never having seen one before, and
eventually asked me what, exactly, she was supposed to do.  I
explained that I had never actually gone through this process before
but I understood that she's supposed to record the fact that I was
re-importing the device and stamp my license somewhere.  She told me
that she didn't know of any place for her to record this.  After some
discussion, we agreed that the best thing to do was to make a Xerox
copy of my license and arrange for it to go wherever it had to go
later.  She stamped the back of the license and sent me on my way.  It
was a little over an hour after I first reached the Customs desk.

My conclusion from all this is that it just isn't possible for an
individual traveler to follow all the rules.  Even having gone through
the process now, I still have no idea how to obtain, let alone file,
the proper forms, even for a device that's already been determined to
be exportable.  The export of export-controlled items is ordinarily
handled by cargo shipment, not by hand carrying by travelers, and the
system is simply not geared to deal with exceptions.  Technically
speaking, everyone with a laptop disk encryption program who travels
abroad is in violation of the law, but since no one actually knows or
checks, no mechanism exists to deal with those who want to follow the
rules.  While (fortunately) everyone I dealt with was sympathetic, no
one in the government who I spoke with was able to actually help me
follow the rules.  I was permitted to leave and come back only because
everyone involved eventually recognized that my telephone was pretty
harmless, that my intentions were good, and that the best thing to do
was be flexible.  If anyone had taken a hard line and tried to enforce
the letter of the law, I simply wouldn't have been able to take the
thing with me, even with my license.  Had I just put my telephone in
my suitcase without telling anyone instead of calling attention to
myself by trying to follow the rules, chances are no one would have
noticed or cared.

Unfortunately, however, these absurd rules carry the full force of
law, and one ignores them only at the risk of being prosecuted for
international arms trafficking.  While it may seem far-fetched to
imagine US citizens prosecuted as arms smugglers simply for carrying
ordinary business products in their luggage, the law as written allows
the government to do just that.  At the same time, anyone who is aware
of and who tries to follow the regulations is made to jump through
pointless hoops that are so obscure that even the people charged with
enforcing them don't know quite what to make of them.

The *Wall Street Journal* has a couple of articles about work monitoring:

  Amy Stevens, Clients second-guess legal fees on-line, The Wall Street
  Journal, 6 January 1995, page B1.

This article discusses several law firms whose clients get daily updates on
their bills, including explanations for each billed bit of time.  Not all
lawyers are happy about this, as one might imagine.  They probably won't get 
a lot of sympathy, but imagine a world in which everyone billed by the minute
in real time and had to explain any given minute to the customer on demand.

This trend may be relevant to another article on the same page:

  Barbara Carton, What's up doc?: Stress and counseling, The Wall Street
  Journal, 6 January 1995, page B1.

It's about the growth of stress management programs for doctors who can't
handle being made to see a new patient every fifteen minutes regardless of 
the nature of the cases.

GREetings!  Just over a year ago *The New York Times* reported that the GRE
would be (partially) administered with the use of computers. The system was
to be "adaptive" (i.e., questions were selected by the computer based on
previous answers by the person tested).  I pointed out some RISKS in the use
of computers for this in general, and the "adaptive" strategy in particular.

I overlooked a simpler RISK.  According to a story by Alice Demnner in
today's *Boston Globe* (1995 Jan 6, p.4), the computerized GRE has problems
because of *recycled questions*.

Apparently questions repeated so frequently that they could be memorized
and given to other test takers. 

The Educational Testing Service (ETS, the private entity that administers
GRE) is "eliminating about three-quarters [!] of the test dates scheduled in
the next five months;" ETS is also "adding questions to the exam."  [Which I
interpret to mean that they won't change the length but will add more
questions to the pool from which the program draws its questions--CPM]
[Well, I interpreted an earlier article to suggest merely that they would
cut down on the opportunities for people to reuse the same answers!  PGN]

The problem was identified by Kaplan Educational Centers, which expressed
doubts that the ETS would be able to cope with the demand for testing with
their reduced schedule.

I guess the lesson is to never underestimate the simplest risks. The 
other lesson, not to base a lot on the GRE scores, was always there.

&gt;From the german newspaper "Starnberger Merkur", January 4th, 1995:

[Sorry, my translation and spelling may be inadequate. I try to get the
meaning across.]

    Pizza in the fields

    Cellular phones make it possible: Israeli soldier's like to order pizza
    delivered even on delicate duty at the lebanon border. [...]
    Almost every night they order food at pizza places and restaurants in
    the neighbourhood. [...] Some pizza joints can already find out about
    troop movement by analyzing the orders.

Even if this currently an exaggeration, it might definitely be a risk for
some.

Heinz Wrobel   <A HREF="mailto:heinz@hwg.muc.de">heinz@hwg.muc.de</A>

   [Ah, yes, the old pizza inference strikes again.  We have had
   various reports in the past relating to increased late-night
   activities in the White House, the Pentagon, etc.  The intelligence
   term for preventing this kind of inference is OPSEC.  I guess in the
   old days it was the apple vendors rather than the pizza parlors that
   were being watched.  This of course led to OPSECing the apple cart.  PGN]

In <A HREF="/Risks/16.71.html">RISKS-16.71</A> Fred Ballard &lt;<A HREF="mailto:72400.1525@compuserve.com">72400.1525@compuserve.com</A>&gt; discussed the
problems with getting programmers to use new features of programming
languages in their code.  He commented that the example of surgeons learning
to wash their hands before surgery suggested that we should expect long
delays between the introduction of a feature in a language, for example, the
ANSI COBOL solution to the date problem, and the utilization of that feature
by "front line" programmers.

I believe that there's a sound engineering reason for many programmer's
failure to adopt new features of programming languages.  It's more than just
ignorance and cussed stubbornness that keeps some of us writing in, for
example, Kernighan and Ritchie C instead of newer versions of the language!

If I am writing software for a specific system, I have no reason not to
use the full language that happens to be supported on that system.  On
the other hand, if I am writing software intended to be portable, I have
every reason to avoid new features and language extensions.  Each such
feature I use will add to the complexity of the instructions I must give
for porting the program, and each such feature may prevent some potential
user from running my code.

For example, if I want to write code using a sophisticated GUI on UNIX,
you'd probably advise me to use C++ and Motif, or some similar combination
of tools.  On the other hand, not all UNIX systems have C++, and not all
have Motif.  If I want to minimize the work needed to port my code to
new systems, I'd better stick to the older, more universally available
standards, the Xt widget set and K&amp;R C.  Anyone with a UNIX system
supporting X will have those!

Not all system administrators are technophilic, in the sense that they rush
out to get the newest implementation of every language or toolkit as soon as
it's released, and as system administration is decentralized, with each
workstation user responsible for upgrading their software, more and more
people will be running ancient compilers and toolkits simply because it's
too much of a hassle to keep installing the newest versions of every
language on their system.

&gt; This standard needs to:
&gt; 1) Be compact
&gt; 2) Decode fast
&gt; 3) Be free from patent/copyright restrictions
&gt; 4) Be rapidly available
&gt; 
&gt; JPEG is certainly a candidate as it is a public standard. The only
&gt; drawback is the slow decoding time.

I'm not saying that replacing GIF is the best solution, but I should point
out some additional factors that would be useful in a generalized image
format:

* The image format should allow for commentary text.

* The image format should be able to contain arbitrary binary data.

* The image format should support "partial retrieval" where the image data
can be used to construct a low-res version before the entire image is
received. Currently I am only aware of one application, Netscape, that can
make use of this feature, but it is invaluable on low-bandwidth connections.

GIF supports all of these features, although they aren't heavily used.
Various applications make use of the comment field. Fractint uses custom
"tagged" data to store fractal generation parameters in the image, and
Netscape can use interlaced GIFs to support low-to-high resolution retrieval
of an image.

GIF has turned out to be an extremely important and useful graphics format,
with some of it's features (like interlacing) only beginning to be used.
Before replacement of something is considered, we must fully understand what
it is we already have.

<P>
Although I have seen much in the past week about ETS and its electronic
testing system, I have seen little in the way of first-hand reports by
people who took the test.
<P>
I am one of those people. Here is my report.
<P>
In the fall of 1992, I had the mistaken notion that I wanted to go to
graduate school in the fall of 1993. I got the GRE application and
discovered that it was too late for me to take the standard written test
and still make my application deadlines. It was possible, however, for me
to pay an additional fee (under $100, but more than $20) and take the
electronic version. This seemed like a godsend, so I willingly parted with
my money and awaited my response.
<P>
I got a form back from ETS approx. three weeks later. I was to call up the
local testing center (in Cambridge, a few blocks from MIT), and make an
appointment. I did this.
<P>
On the appointed day, I showed up at the ETS testing center. They seemed
very disorganized. The center was a quarter of the floor of a medium-sized
office building. There was a reception desk up front, a waiting area, and
rows of offices with windows. Across from the offices was the "testing
room" --- a long, narrow room. There were tables along the walls, computers
on the tables, chairs, and windows that overlooked the offices. The
arrangement, apparently, was to make it difficult for people taking the
test to see other people's screens, and easy for people to look into the
room and see if we were cheating.
<P>
I presented two forms of identification, which the receptionist
scrutinized. I then waited in the reception area until the appropriate
time. Three other people showed up. We were then led to the testing area. I
sat down at one machine, and the test began.
<P>
I should say here that I found taking the test on the computer to be a much
more enjoyable experience than taking the test on paper. The test is
self-paced. You have a little count-down timer in the corner of your screen
showing you how many minutes and seconds are left in a particular section.
You can abort the section at any point and go to the next section.
<P>
The test looks much the same as the regular test: diagrams or reading
comprehension paragraphs, with questions. You answered the question by
clicking on a bubble --- just as if you were filling it in with a pencil.
You could also mark questions. You could switch to an outline view that
showed every question  how you had answered it, and whether or not it was
marked. You could click directly to a question.
<P>
Was the test susceptible to cheating? Absolutely. Quite simply, we were
not watched. There was intermittent talking between two of the test takers
on the day of my test. I could see screens of other test-takers. Infact,
one of the students seemed to doing the same questions that I was doing.
<P>
ETS said that one of the advantages of the computer-test is that the exam
will be able to adopt to the student in real-time. This will make the exam
more precise, allowing it to zero-in on the student's exact abilities. In
my experience, though, I didn't see any such adapting. (I vaguely recall
that ETS said that the adapting wasn't being used the year that I took the
test, but it may be online now.)
<P>
Between each section, we were given a short break. At the end of the test,
I was given the chance to cancel the entire test. If I didn't want to do
that, I could view my result. However, if I viewed my result, that made it
permanent.
<P>
I got my score and left. Instead of taking the regular 3 1/2 hours, I was
finished in two.
<P>
As I said, it was a very enjoyable experience.

On Godfrey: My interpretation of the letter was that the complexity of the
tax code is what prevents them from automatic the transcription fully.  It
takes a human accountant to go through the financial records and determine
what should be copied to the distribution calculation.

While I doubt that it's actually impossible to automate this, it's quite

Frankly, I'm surprised at RISKS people flaming Fidelity for this error.
IMHO, this is an example of a company whose procedures *worked*.  As we all
know, no process is infallible, and checks are necessary to catch the
errors.  Of course it would be nice if the checks always occurred before the
failures became public, but the important thing in this case is that the
checks occurred before checks were cut (sorry for the pun).

Maybe there is also a cultural RISK??  Magellan Fund does not expect

error.  Perhaps a computer version of a freudian slip??  So, procedures
for manual entry of data need to take into account the potential

Unfortunately, the disclaimer at the end of Mr. Blaze's posting makes it
impossible to extract the single paragraph I wished to comment on (another
RISK in itself) so I will have to wing it.  <I>[Nice observance!  PGN]</I>
<P>
The RISK a government takes in enacting such laws is that people will try to
act within them. To me one of the most powerful strengths of the USA is that
a large portion of the citizenry feel free to point out just how absurd some
laws are by insisting on their enforcement. If everyone did, whether out of
"creative anarchy" as here or pure fear of the consequences as exists in
unnamed countries (fortunately regimes based on fear never seem to last very
long since stagnation is inevitable).
<P>
IMHO, unenforceable laws are bad laws primarily because they degrade respect
for all laws (look at speed limits for one example). Of course many laws are
broken simply because they are unknown (does everyone have a leash for their
alligator ?), obscure, and/or unenforced.
<P>
Further, where enforced, people quickly learn the right words to say (when
I built a home for my hobby, on my first application I said "garage" and
was told that for the size it needed steel doors and a commercial fire
sprinkler system. It immediately became a "garage/workshop" and so came under
le$$ re$trictive residential requirements).
<P>
The bottom line is that it takes people like Matt to take the time and
trouble to point out the absurdities in order to get them "fixed" - after
all in the best of worlds, that is what bureaucrats are for. IMHO doing
something like this is worth it provided you never have to do it again.

The flap here in Israel regarding cellular phones began when newly inducted
soldiers brought the phones to basic training at boot camp. The concern had
less to do with security risks but rather socio-economic concern: Soldiers
who could afford cellular phones (which are ridiculously expensive in Israel
and serve as status symbols) and those who couldn't. One of the most
important features of the Israeli Army is that it is an army of the people:
many and women from the age of 18 serve two (for women) and three (for men)
years, and then do reserve duty once a month till the age of 55. The use of
cellular phones by new recruits caused concern for the melting pot
characteristic of the army and serves to introduce additional stress between
those who can afford the phones and those who can't. The pizza on the other
hand is another story....

<P>
The problem with cellular telephones in Military/Emergency service use is
that they work too well!  In an emergency people get rather discouraged when
their incredibly expensive radio system is overloaded, and unusable, but a
simple cell phone works perfectly well. If you are in an emergency
situation, and you are reduced to whistling into a microphone in morse code
to try to get your message through an overloaded radio channel, then, if you
have a cell phone, you will use it regardless of security.
<P>
Of course, in some cases the cell phone may be more secure than other means
of communication!

<P>
It is my understanding, based on a conversation with Richard Stallman two
years ago, that the Unisys patent on
<A HREF="gopher://wiretap.spies.com:70/00/Library/Techdoc/Misc/lzwexp.txt">LZW</A>
only covers compression, and not
decompression. This is the reason that the GNU gnuzip compression program
can decompression "compressed" archives without violating any (known)
patents.
<P>
This, of course, means that there is a simple and reasonably transparent
solution to the current GIF crisis:
<OL>
<LI>Adopt a new compression standard for GIF.
<LI>All newly created GIF files will be in this standard.
<LI>Continue to support decompression of GIF files compressed with
<A HREF="gopher://wiretap.spies.com:70/00/Library/Techdoc/Misc/lzwexp.txt">LZW</A>,
because that does not violate the Unisys patent.
</OL>
For a compression algorithm, we could use the simpler compression algorithm
used by programs like PGP (I think that it is straight LZ, rather than
<A HREF="gopher://wiretap.spies.com:70/00/Library/Techdoc/Misc/lzwexp.txt">LZW</A>),
or we could use the algorithm that gnuzip uses (which is better at
compression than
<A HREF="gopher://wiretap.spies.com:70/00/Library/Techdoc/Misc/lzwexp.txt">LZW</A>,
but executes more slowly).

Peter Bishop refers to the recently announced
UNISYS/<A HREF="http://www.compuserve.com">COMPUSERVE</A>
patent restriction and recommends switching over to
use the Free Software Foundation's GZIP.  This may not solve the
problem.  In the same issue of RISKS, Tim Oren of
<A HREF="http://www.compuserve.com">Compuserve</A> pointed
out that the restriction had been imposed entirely by Unisys, and that
<A HREF="http://www.compuserve.com">Compuserve</A>

am not sure what compression algorithm ZIP &amp; GZIP use, but I was under
the impression that they use
<A HREF="gopher://wiretap.spies.com:70/00/Library/Techdoc/Misc/lzwexp.txt">LZW</A>,

<P>
This discussion brings several time-related bugs from my past to mind.
<P>
One of the more mundane was the October bug.  We introduced some new
date/time functions into our code sometime in the spring or summer.
They all seemed to work fine.  When October came around, things started
behaving strangely (obvious "core walks" for you UNIX folk).  The problem?
Months were zero-based (0-11) but were displayed one-based (1-12).  The
code used the zero-based number to calculate the number of digits required
for display.  Simple coding error. The bigger problem was a lack of unit
testers to test all ranges of dates instead of relying on the normal passage
of time.  When the problems first showed up it had been months since we had
worked on the date/time code so it was not immediately suspected.
<P>
A more interesting bug which shows just how likely it is for time to not be
accurate if it's not fetched atomically showed up when we had our product
running on a 286-based UNIX (XENIX I think).  I forget the exact details,
but we had your basic C language MIN() type macro, which looked something
like this:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE
#define MIN(x, y)	(((x) &lt; (y)) ? (x) : (y))
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
Simple enough.  Until someone did something like this:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
least_time = MIN(time((long *) NULL), old_time);
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
[ the time() function in UNIX returns the number of seconds since the epoch ].
<P>
This looks innocent enough, but it expands so that there are two time()
calls -- one during the comparison and one to get the value the expression
evaluates to.  Our expectation was that either the original x or y would be
the result of using the macro.  Instead, some cases evaluated to x plus some
number of seconds -- the number of seconds we gotted swapped out on that
pathetic system between the two calls.

Actually, it's even worse than Dave is saying.  See, UTC was adopted in
1961, but the leap second system was not adopted until 1972.  For at least
some of the years in between, when adjustments in UTC were needed, the *rate
of time* was changed. That is, instead of extra seconds, there would be
*longer* seconds (and proportionately longer milliseconds).  So the true
conversion of a time stored in milliseconds since some time in 1582 is
complicated indeed!

Actually, there are TWO bugs.  The T$ in line 160 [which should be 150]
should be T1$.  The program specification was that it should make N calls to
DATE$ and 2N calls to DATE$, so these really are bugs, not just alternative
interpretations.

<P>
Anyone who has received an itinerary from a travel agent knows that airlines
tend to publish their schedules with departure and arrival times expressed
in local time.
<P>
While this is little more than an inconvenience for travelers who want
to figure out flight durations, it can become a more serious problem
when the airlines use local times in their internal computer systems
(and inflict these files on third-party software developers!).
<P>
A case in point involves an airline who had a flight out of Athens
at 0205 on 25sep94 (local time). Unfortunately, according to the
airline's timezone information, Athens switches from daylight savings
(UTC+0300) to standard time (UTC+0200) at exactly 0300 on 25sep94.
In other words, 25sep94 0205 occurs twice, so when converting this
time to UTC you have a 50/50 chance of being out by an hour.
<P>
In our particular case the only risk was that the system would report
the cabin crew working hours as being one hour less than reality, but
the results could potentially be more serious, especially if the
computers at the airport get confused.

I bought a used 1994 Geo Prizm with a factory-installed Delco radio that
claims to have a "theft deterrent."  The owner's manual says "the theft
deterrent feature ... can be used or ignored.  If ignored, the system
plays normally.  If it is used, your system won't be usable if it's ever
stolen.  The instructions below tell you how to enter a security code
into the system.  If your vehicle loses battery power for any reason,
you must enter the security code again before the system will turn on."
<P>
I was tempted to ignore it, but decided, what the heck, I suppose I'd
better use it.  Well, of course, I discovered that the previous owner had
entered a security code, and had not removed it when the car was sold.
So if anyone were to leave the car headlights on overnight and drain the
battery (why, no, <EM>I</EM>
certainly couldn't be so stupid as to do that :-) )
the radio would become unusable.
<P>
The used-car dealer had no idea what to do, but suggested I call a Chevy
dealer.  The Chevy dealer hadn't ever heard of the situation and wasn't
aware the radio had such a feature, and suggested I call a Chevy 800 number.
The Chevy 800 number know nothing, and suggested I call a Delco 800 number.
At every stage, of course, I had to explain the security feature, which
apparently was new to the 1994 model.  And at every stage I had to endure
further misunderstandings, because at each stage, they were initially
unable to understand why there was any problem given that the radio worked.
<P>
Delco said, "sure, no problem, we'll fax the dealer the directions, a
lot of them don't know about it."  I asked how long the fix took and was
told, "it depends how good they are at following directions.  If the
radio isn't inoperative yet it's easy, otherwise it gets pretty involved."
<P>
I took the car to the dealer.  I had a chance to glance at the faxed
instructions but not read them carefully.  I have the impression that if
the radio isn't inoperative, removing the security code just requires
entering a complicated, but fixed series of digits and button-pushes.
(A savvy radio thief would have to remember to do this BEFORE
stealing the radio).  After it has had power removed and decided to become
inoperative, there is a much longer procedure, involving calling Delco
to get a dealer code, leaving the radio unpowered for a long time, etc.
<P>
Later that morning the dealer called me and said, "We think your ignition
lock security system must be interfering with your radio because we tried
your radio and everything works fine, including the cassette player."  So
I explained the problem once again.  I came by at noon as agreed to pick it
up and was told it would take a little longer, "because we are waiting for
Delco to call us back with a dealer code."  When I picked it up, they HAD
removed the old security code (and installed a new one, but they told me
what it was).  It had forgotten all the station settings.  I suspect that
they either did the complicated procedure when they only needed to do the
simple one, or someone disconnected the radio as part of their
troubleshooting, or someone couldn't resist disconnecting it to see what
would really happen...
<P>
What's the RISK?  Well, given that people do sell used cars, and that
many people may not even bother to read that part of the manual--
especially if the radio is working--what has been achieved overall is
to take a highly reliable car radio and reduce its life expectancy to
the same as that of a car battery.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
     <B>Maryland Delays New Auto Tests</B>
<P>
     A computer glitch has forced the delay of Maryland's tough new
     auto emissions testing program.
<P>
          The state Motor Vehicle Administration announced Friday
     that the start-up of the program would be delayed for several
     weeks to fix the problems in the software used to measure
     emissions.  The MVA had planned to start mailing notices Friday
     to about 25,000 ddrivers to get their cars and trucks tested.
<P>
          "it's not going to start until we're satisfied we can
     give a quick and accurate test."  MVA Administrator W. Marshall
     Rickert Jr. said.
<P>
          The General Assembly passed the tougher testing program after the
     federal government ordered the state to reduce smog.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Comments heard on this topic include the opinion that it might be an
excuse to delay this testing which includes having a state driver test
your car at 55 mph on a dynamometer.  The test will be more costly that
the present test and is expected to result in a high failure rate.

<P>
At work recently we just installed a Vax 4000 with 2 model 100's as our
hosts and numerous model 60's, VLC's, and a few model 90's as our basic
system workstations. Approx 20 workstations total along with an assortment
of LAN Bridge 150's / 200's, local segment repeaters all tied together on
thick wire ethernet and fiber optic cable. Its primary use is being our
plant computer for the nuclear power plant I work at, so it is in constant
use. A vast majority of the extra network equipment is for redundancy
being that we hate to loose any plant info/data in case of a failure.
Anyway, I was curious to see what other system users performed on their
systems as regular preventive maintenance and the such being that we are
new to the system. Defrag HD, cleaning bridges/repeaters/servers, host
cpu's, etc. Right now, we are tied to using built in VMS utilities and  I
would like your suggestions. I have gotten a good bit of info from the
system managers manual, but wasn't sure if there were any other tricks I
may have missed. VMS is totally new to me, so pardon my simple
description. &lt;G&gt; Any help would be appreciated.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
"Telesat Canada engineers have succeeded in a five-month rescue
effort by reestablishing pointing control over the Anik E2
satellite without the use of its failed momentum wheel systems,
thus salvaging a $203-million asset."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
This is the first time that a rescue of a geosynchronous, 3-axis
stabilized satellite without a serviceable momentum wheel on board has
been successful (other satellites with this type of problem have been
abandoned, in the past). No one is certain why the integrated
circuits in the control systems failed, but it is believed that
electrostatic discharge during an intense solar storm is to blame.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"...during the five months that the satellite was out of action,
Telesat Canada lost about $15 million. Engineers devised an
alternative pointing system...and installed two entirely separate
ground-based systems for redundancy. A software program developed
by Telesat Canada engineers...keeps track of the satellite in
three axes and calculates adjustments in pointing."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Anik E2 service life will be shortened by one year because of the
extra fuel used in re-positioning the satellite during it life.

In the Jan. 12 LA Times, Pacific Bell, the US Geological Service, and
CalTech, announced an 18 month trial of a new system for measuring the
effects of earthquakes. The system uses sensors placed around
Southern California that relay data to CalTech's computers during
a 5+ magnitude earthquake. The data is reduced to give emergency
crews the location of large ground accelerations so that they
can tailor their responses. (Large ground motion can occur far
away from the epicenter, e.g. Filmore is about 20 miles from
Northridge yet it was severely damaged in the 6.8 quake.)
<P>
One interesting issue is testing the system: a 5+ quake is required.
A Pacific Bell official said they would extend the test period if
an appropriate quake doesn't occur. Talk about waiting a long time
for test runs...

<P>
Not so many years ago, I needed a certified check from my large Boston-area
bank.  I arrived at my branch office at 9:05am, gave a teller appropriate
paperwork to transfer funds from savings to checking, and then had the
necessary incantations performed to transform my normal everyday check into
a certified check.  Among other things, this caused the check amount to be
immediately debited from my checking account; but since I'd just requested a
transfer of the necessary amount into checking, the teller did not complain
about the apparent overdraft.  So far so good.
<P>
Within a week I received an overdraft penalty notice, because my transaction
at the teller window to do the transfer was not processed until after midnight
thus leaving my checking account short that day.  I had to show my transfer
receipt, with its 9:05am timestamp, to an actual human before the bank would
clear the penalty.
<P>
The incident taught me to avoid teller transactions whenever possible, though,
because the nice human who cleared the penalty told me that all the ATM
transactions were cleared first, before teller transactions, each evening.
A RISK of avoiding new technology??

At the end of January middle of February this year Microsoft will be
introducing Internet Assistant.  A HTML creater and WEB browser for Word for
Windows 6.0.
<P>
The WEB browser will read Word 6.0 documents directly and therefore the risk.
<P>
Word documents can come with programming that will activate on opening.  While
this has always been a problem document distribution hasn't generally been
widespread until soon from now.
<P>
Three types of things I can see happening.
<OL>
<LI>Viral type documents.  These are documents that will change your
normal.dot and copy itself from document to document.
<LI>Trojan Horse type 1 documents.  These are documents that do something on
opening, like delete files etc....And possible even harmless things.
<LI>Trojan Horse type 2 documents.  Really scary documents that communicate
BACK to the web-server without your knowing it and sending additional
information gleaned from your machine and or network.  There are some truly
scary things that could be done with a creative VBA/CGI programmer.
</UL>
It is unfortunate that these risks exist, because otherwise the ability to
have "programmable" documents on the web is a really cool concept.  But
nonetheless risks like these have to be dealt with

You can now read the complete RISKS archives on the World Wide Web (apart

volume.issue.html where issues is always a two digit number:

is the first issue of volume 16. The URL <A HREF="http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks">http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks</A>
gives you an introduction page and leads you to the indices for previous

The translation from RISKS to html is automatic so there may be errors.
Please report any that you find to me so that I can fix them. Currently the
text of messages is left as pre-formatted text. I have hand converted issues

HarperCollins has just released MASTERS OF DECEPTION: The Gang That Ruled
Cyberspace, a new book by New York Newsday journalists Michelle Slatalla
and Joshua Quittner. You might recall the book from a cover story in the
December issue of WIRED. Slatalla and Quittner unravel the story of gang
warfare between the Legion of Doom (LOD) and the Masters of Deception
(MOD), a turf battle fought through the phone system that led to one of
the most high-profile hacker prosecutions ever.
<P>
Slatalla and Quittner followed the Masters of Deception story for five
years at Newsday. When the WIRED excerpt appeared, their phone service was
hacked and their e-mail attacked by a group calling themselves the
Internet Liberation Front, or ILF. A police investigation is still in
progress.
<P>
The authors begin an 8-city tour in New York today. They are planning to
kick off a "cybertour" in February. The book is available for purchase on
Delphi (Online Bookstore) and CompuServe (Go HAR), or at your local
bookstore.The WIRED excerpt is on HotWIRED at the following URL:

CA-95:01                         CERT Advisory
                                January 23, 1995
                IP Spoofing Attacks and Hijacked Terminal Connections
</PRE>
The CERT Coordination Center has received reports of attacks in which
intruders create packets with spoofed source IP addresses. These attacks
exploit applications that use authentication based on IP addresses. This
exploitation leads to user and possibly root access on the targeted system.
Note that this attack does not involve source routing. Recommended solutions
are described in Section III below.
<P>
In the current attack pattern, intruders may dynamically modify the kernel of
a Sun 4.1.X system once root access is attained.  In this attack, which is
separate from the IP spoofing attack, intruders use a tool to take control of
any open terminal or login session from users on the system. Note that
although the tool is currently being used primarily on SunOS 4.1.x systems,
the system features that make this attack possible are not unique to SunOS.
<P>
As we receive additional information relating to this advisory, we will place
it, along with any clarifications, in a <A HREF="ftp://info.cert.org/CA-95:01.README">CA-95:01.README</A> file. CERT advisories
and their associated README files are available by anonymous FTP from
info.cert.org. We encourage you to check the README files regularly for
updates on advisories that relate to your site.
<DL>
<DT>I.   Description 
<DD>
     This description summarizes both the IP spoofing technique that can
     lead to root access on a system and the tool that intruders are using to
     take over open terminal and login connections after they get root access.
     We are currently seeing attacks in which intruders combine IP spoofing
     with use of the tool. However, these are two separate actions. Intruders
     can use IP spoofing to gain root access for any purpose; similarly, they
     can highjack terminal connections regardless of their method of gaining
     root access. 
<DL>
<DT>IP spoofing
        To gain access, intruders create packets with spoofed source IP
        addresses. This exploits applications that use authentication based on
        IP addresses and leads to unauthorized user and possibly root access
        on the targeted system. It is possible to route packets through
        filtering-router firewalls if they are not configured to filter
        incoming packets whose source address is in the local domain. It
        is important to note that the described attack is possible even if 
        no reply packets can reach the attacker.
<P>
        Examples of configurations that are potentially vulnerable include
<UL>
        <LI>routers to external networks that support multiple internal
          interfaces
        <LI>routers with two interfaces that support subnetting on the 
          internal network
        <LI>proxy firewalls where the proxy applications use the source
          IP address for authentication
</UL>
        The IP spoofing attacks we are currently seeing are similar to those
        described in two papers:
	<OL><LI><CITE>"Security Problems in the TCP/IP Protocol
        Suite" by Steve Bellovin, published in _Computer Communication Review_
        vol. 19, no. 2 (April 1989) pages 32-48; </CITE>
	<LI><CITE>"A Weakness in the 4.2BSD
        Unix TCP/IP Software" by Robert T. Morris</CITE>.
	</OL>
Both papers are available by anonymous FTP from

           Morris paper:   <A HREF="ftp://ftp.research.att.com:/dist/internet_security/117.ps.Z">117.ps.Z</A>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
        Services that are vulnerable to the IP spoofing attack include
<UL>
           <LI>SunRPC &amp; NFS 
           <LI>BSD UNIX "r" commands
           <LI>anything wrapped by the tcp daemon wrappers - site dependent; check
               your configuration
           <LI>X windows 
           <LI>other applications that use source IP addresses for authentication
</UL>
    <DT>Hijacking tool
    <DD>Once the intruders have root access on a system, they can use a tool
        to dynamically modify the UNIX kernel. This modification allows them
        to hijack existing terminal and login connections from any user on the
        system. 
 <P>
        In taking over the existing connections, intruders can bypass one-time
        passwords and other strong authentication schemes by tapping the
        connection after the authentication is complete. For example, a
        legitimate user connects to a remote site through a login or terminal
        session; the intruder hijacks the connection after the user has
        completed the authentication to the remote location; the remote site
        is now compromised. (See Section I for examples of vulnerable
        configurations.)
<P>
        Currently, the tool is used primarily on SunOS 4.1.x systems. However,
        the system features that make this attack possible are not unique to
        SunOS.

</DL>
<DT>II. Impact
<DD>
     Current intruder activity in spoofing source IP addresses can lead to
     unauthorized remote root access to systems behind a filtering-router
     firewall. 
<P>
     After gaining root access and taking over existing terminal and login
     connections, intruders can gain access to remote hosts.


<DT>III. Solutions
     
    <DL>
    <DT> A. Detection

        <DD><DL>IP spoofing
	<DD>   If you monitor packets using network-monitoring software such as
           netlog, look for a packet on your external interface that has 
           both its source and destination IP addresses in your local domain.
           If you find one, you are currently under attack. Netlog is
           available by anonymous FTP from 
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
              <A HREF="ftp://net.tamu.edu:/pub/security/TAMU/netlog-1.2.tar.gz">net.tamu.edu:/pub/security/TAMU/netlog-1.2.tar.gz</A><BR>
              MD5 checksum: 1dd62e7e96192456e8c75047c38e994b
	</BLOCKQUOTE>

           Another way to detect IP spoofing is to compare the process
           accounting logs between systems on your internal network. If
           the IP spoofing attack has succeeded on one of your systems,
           you may get a log entry on the victim machine showing a remote
           access; on the apparent source machine, there will be no
           corresponding entry for initiating that remote access.

           connection, users may detect unusual activity, such as commands
           appearing on their terminal that they did not type or a blank window
           that will no longer respond to their commands. Encourage your users
           to inform you of any such activity. In addition, pay particular
           attention to connections that have been idle for a long time.
<P>
           Once the attack is completed, it is difficult to detect. However,
           the intruders may leave remnants of their tools. For example, you
           may find a kernel streams module designed to tap into existing TCP
           connections.

     <DT>B. Prevention

        <DD><DL>IP spoofing
           <DD>The best method of preventing the IP spoofing problem is to install
           a filtering router that restricts the input to your external
           interface (known as an input filter) by not allowing a packet
           through if it has a source address from your internal network. In
           addition, you should filter outgoing packets that have a source
           address different from your internal network in order to prevent
           a source IP spoofing attack originating from your site.
<P>
           The following vendors have reported support for this feature:
	<UL>
             <LI>Bay Networks/Wellfleet routers, version 5 and later
             <LI>Cabletron - LAN Secure
             <LI>Cisco - RIS software all releases of version 9.21 and later 
             <LI>Livingston - all versions
</UL>
           If you need more information about your router or about firewalls,
           please contact your vendor directly.
<P>
           If your vendor's router does not support filtering on the inbound
           side of the interface or if there will be a delay in incorporating
           the feature into your system, you may filter the spoofed IP packets
           by using a second router between your external interface and your
           outside connection. Configure this router to block, on the outgoing
           interface connected to your original router, all packets that have a
           source address in your internal network. For this purpose, you can
           use a filtering router or a UNIX system with two interfaces that
           supports packet filtering. 
<P>        
           NOTE: Disabling source routing at the router does not protect you
                 from this attack, but it is still good security practice to
                 do so.

[The CERT advisory is the <A HREF="#subj1">previous item</A> in this issue.
Also, see John Markoff's front-page story in yesterday's
editions of The New York Times, 23 Jan 1995.  PGN]
</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
There's a great deal of confusion about what kind of attack the recent CERT
advisory is referring to.  Let me try to clear things up.
<P>
The specific attack is a sequence number guessing attack, originally
described by R.T. Morris in Bell Labs Computer Science Technical Report
#117, February 25, 1985.  I generalized (and publicized) the attack in my
1989 paper ``Security Problems in the TCP/IP Protocol Suite'', Computer
Communications Review 19:2, April 1989, pp. 32-48 (URLs below).  Both his
attack and my generalizations are special cases of a more general attack, IP
source address spoofing, in which the attacker illegitimately uses a trusted
machine's IP address in conjunction with some protocol (such as rsh) that
does address-based authentication.
<P>
In order to understand the particular case of sequence number guessing, you
have to look at the 3-way handshake used in the TCP open sequence.  Suppose
client machine A wants to talk to rsh server B.  It sends the following
message:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A-&gt;B: SYN, ISSa
</BLOCKQUOTE>
That is, it sends a packet with the SYN (``synchronize sequence
number'') bit set and an initial sequence number ISSa.
<P>
B replies with
<BLOCKQUOTE>
B-&gt;A: SYN, ISSb, ACK(ISSa)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
In addition to sending its own initial sequence number, it acknowledges A's.
Note that the actual numeric value ISSa must appear in the message.
<P>
A concludes the handshake by sending
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A-&gt;B: ACK(ISSb)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The initial sequence numbers are intended to be more or less random.  More
precisely, RFC 793 specifies that the 32-bit counter be incremented by 1 in
the low-order position about every 4 microseconds.  Instead,
Berkeley-derived kernels increment it by 128 every second, and 64 for each
new connection.  Thus, if you open a connection to a machine, you know to a
very high degree of confidence what sequence number it will use for its next
connection.  And therein lies the attack.
<P>
The attacker X first opens a real connection to its target B -- say, to the
mail port or the TCP echo port.  This gives ISSb.  It then impersonates A
and sends
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A-&gt;B: SYN, ISSx
</BLOCKQUOTE>
B's response to X's original SYN (so to speak)
<BLOCKQUOTE>>
B-&gt;A: SYN, ISSb', ACK(ISSx)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
goes to the legitimate A, about which more anon.  X never sees that message
but can still send
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A-&gt;B: ACK(ISSb')
</BLOCKQUOTE>
using the predicted value for ISSb'.  If the guess is right -- and usually
it will be -- B's rsh server thinks it has a legitimate connection with A,
when in fact X is sending the packets.  X can't see the output from this
session, but it can execute commands as more or less any user -- and in that
case, the game is over and X has won.
<P>
There is a minor difficulty here.  If A sees B's message, it will realize
that B is acknowledging something it never sent, and will send a RST packet
in response to tear down the connection.  There are a variety of ways to
prevent this; the easiest is to wait until the real A is down (possibly as a
result of enemy action, of course).
<P>
There are several possible defenses.  Most obvious is to take advantage of
topological knowledge: don't let packets purporting to be from a local
machine arrive on an outside interface.  That works very well if you only
trust local machines.  If trust is granted to outside machines (say, via
.rhosts files) and if the attacker can identify the patterns of trust (which
isn't that difficult), the topological solution won't work.  In that case,
you have to block all protocols that use TCP and address-based
authentication.  (UDP is a separate can of worms.)
<P>
Best of all, don't use address-based authentication; it's a disaster
waiting to happen.  The only real solution is cryptographic
authentication.
<P>
Firewalls based on tcpd have a special problem: address-based authentication
is their business.  If you have a set of rules that grants special
permission to inside addresses, and you don't use a screening router as
well, you may be vulnerable.  The question is this: can an attacker do
damage by just sending commands and not seeing any output? If the answer is
yes, you are vulnerable.

     [Excerpted with permission from Phil's The Network Observer]
</I>
<P>
  <B>Bouncemail top ten.</B>
<P>
  In running a large mailing list for the past year or so, I
  have become acquainted with a depressing variety of dysfunctional
  mail handling software.  I've gathered here my top ten least
  favorite phenomena in hopes that a Universal Union of Large List
  Maintainers might spring up to force them to get fixed:
<P>
<PRE>
    10.  Mailers that give intermittent "user unknown" messages
         for users who perfectly well exist, perhaps because they
         cannot detect transient local network problems well enough
         to postpone delivering mail.

     9.  The confusion over the Errors-To: field, which sure
         seems like a good idea to me but which apparently is not
         part of the standard.  It is supported by most but not
         all mailers.  If it didn't exist then I'd have to run my
         mailing list from a separate account.

     8.  Mailers that generate messages lacking well-formed
         headers, most commonly addresses like "someone@local"
         without proper domain information.

     7.  Mailers that tell me "Press F1 for help with VNM error
         codes" even though my function keys are unlikely to be
         programmed the same way as they are for users at the
         site that generates the bouncemail message.  In general,
         mailers designed on the assumption that all senders and
         recipients of messages would use that same mailer --
         particularly when the mailer in question does not think in
         terms of standard IP domain formats.

     6.  Mailers that complain that a certain message could not be
         delivered but do not specify who in particular the message
         could not be delivered to.  Also, mailers that complain
         that a forwarded message could not be delivered without
         providing any indication of what address(es) the message
         was forwarded from.

     5.  Vacation programs that respond to bulk or mailing-list
         mail or that do not keep track of who they've replied to,
         with the result that I get batches of spurious vacation
         messages (sometimes in German) as each holiday approaches.

     4.  Mailers that generate mail that cannot be replied to.
         Sometimes a message says "From: Fred_Q_Smith@foobar.com",
         even though the user's account is actually called "fqs".
         Sometimes I have no idea why I cannot reply to a message,
         and the mailer offers me no help in figuring it out.
         This is particularly annoying when the sender in question
         starts sending further messages to the effect of, "you
         should reply to my messages, you rude person!"  It is
         even more annoying when the machine that generated the
         bogus message does not have a "postmaster" alias defined.

     3.  Mailers that take a month before giving up on the delivery
         of messages to a missing user, whereupon they initiate
         a monthlong stream of error messages, individually, for
         every one of the messages I've sent in the last month.

     2.  Mail-reading programs that automatically generate a little
         message to the effect of "so-and-so read your message
         about "routine administrative notes" on December 3rd at
         08:41" -- even when the message was sent to a mailing list
         and not directly to the person reading it.  The people
         whose mail readers generate these messages are usually not
         aware of them, and their site maintainers usually do not
         know how to shut them off.
         
     1.  The astoundingly baroque and uninformative error messages
         that I have gotten from the Novell mailer.
</PRE>
  Of course errors happen.  The basic point here is that the error
  messages are so incomprehensible, so incomplete, so inconsistent,
  and so difficult to adjust or control.  The right way to do this,
  in my view, would be for mailers to be talking to one another and
  maintaining updated status tables for the process of delivering
  (or not delivering) each message.  A reasonable amount of useful
  information could travel over these lines of communication, and
  my mailer could consequently provide me with some significantly
  more useful functionalities.  Imagine a GUI interface with a
  window showing the messages that got bounced, deferred, and so
  forth.  And imagine that I could just click on each one to say,
  in one nice clean operation, "okay, let's just take this person
  off the mailing list, send them a nice explanatory note in case
  they're magically back on-line, and expunge from the system all
  remaining traces of existing messages from me to them or error
  messages from these mailers about them".

<i>Thu, 19 Jan 1995 09:46:39 -0500</i>
<P>
Some readers of RISKS will recall numerous previous articles about
suboptimal behavior of the electronic postal stamp vending machines which
have been appearing in United States Post Offices over the past few years.
I am one of the many people who at one point or another has lost money in
one of the machines.  However, this message isn't about that; it's about a
case I witnessed recently in which the vending machine *almost* got it
right, but still has a few kinks that need to be worked out.
<P>
On the first business day after the recent US postal rate increase, I went
to the Post Office to buy some new stamps.  Of course, it was a madhouse,
because everyone else had the same idea I did.  However, although the line
in front of the service windows was many people long, there were only one
person using the vending machine, with no line behind him.  I therefore
decided to get in line behind him, since I had enough crisp bills (or so I
thought) to buy stamps from the machine.
<P>
The man was standing in front of the machine, whose LED display claimed that
he had a $5.00 credit (presumably because of a five-dollar bill he'd
inserted), trying to get the machine to take a one-dollar bill (he wanted to
buy a book of twenty 32-cent stamps for $6.40).  The bill slot in the
machine wasn't pulling in his bill part way and then rejecting it, as you
might expect it to do if it could not verify the bill.  The slot wasn't
engaging at all, i.e., the man was pushing the bill into the slot over and
over, and nothing was happening.
<P>
He did this five or ten times, then stopped, turned around to look at the
service windows as if trying to attract someone's attention, wavered
momentarily as if contemplating actually going over to the windows to ask
for assistance, and then turned around and started shoving the bill at the
bill slot again.  He repeated this cycle three or four times, with me
standing there thinking, "Look, idiot, if the slot wouldn't take the bill
the first time, it isn't going take it the hundredth time either," and
wondering why he didn't just buy a booklet of ten stamps and come back for
more later.  Finally, he got up the courage to go over to the windows and
ask for help.
<P>
A few seconds after he walked away from the machine, it started beeping,
with the LED display asking if he needed more time, and saying that if he
didn't press the "YES" button he'd lose his money.  Since I'm a nice guy, I
pressed the "YES" button for him.
<P>
Meanwhile, the woman he was talking to at a service window was telling him
something to the effect of, "Well, I don't know anything about the vending
machine.  You'll have to talk to &lt;so-and-so&gt;.  She's in charge of it.  She's
in back right now.  Hold on, I'll send her out.  Go back to the machine and
wait for her."
<P>
So, the man went back to the machine and stood there waiting.  I said to
him, "Why don't you just buy a booklet of ten stamps and come back later for
more?"  He said, gesturing at the sign on the machine which says that change
over a dollar is given in dollars, "Because then I'll lose money."  I'm not
sure what gave him that impression, but I explained to him that what the
sign meant was that the machine issues Susan B. Anthony dollars when it has
to issue change of more than a dollar.
<P>
Once he understood that, he went ahead and pushed the button sequence for
the booklet of ten stamps.  The machine then spit his five-dollar bill out
of the bill slot and informed him on the LED display that it was currently
unable to issue change of over a dollar.  At this point, the woman "in
charge of" the vending machine showed up and asked what the story was.  The
man told her what had happened, and she basically repeated everything he'd
done (putting in his five-dollar bill, trying repeatedly to get the machine
to take the additional one-dollar bill, giving up and trying to buy ten
stamps, getting back the five-dollar bill), at which point she said, "Well,
I don't know what's wrong.  I guess you'll just have to get in line with
everybody else."
<P>
At this point, I decided that trying to use the vending machine myself would
not be a productive endeavor, so I picked up a copy of the USPS
stamps-by-mail pamphlet and walked out.  It was only when I'd made it out of
the Post Office a few steps that I realized what astute RISKS readers have
realized already -- the vending machine's behavior made perfect sense, and
was in reality protecting the user from losing money, although its user
interface needs some improvement.  As I see it, the explanation for the
machine's behavior is as follows....
<P>
Most bill readers, in vending machines, change machines, etc., can only
return to the user the last bill inserted into the machine.  I.e., if I
insert a five-dollar bill into a reader and then a one-dollar bill, the
reader can return the one-dollar bill to me if necessary, but the
five-dollar bill is lost in the innards of the machine.
<P>
The stamp machine in this case was programmed to know that it couldn't give
back more than a dollar in change (presumably because its supply of dollar
coins was exhausted), and also to know that if it allowed the user to insert
more than one bill, it might not be able to give back adequate change after
the user completed his purchase.  For example, if the user inserted two
five-dollar bills and then purchased $6.40 worth of stamps, the machine
would have to issue $3.60 in change, which it couldn't do.  It therefore
refused to accept the second bill.
<P>
So, what are the problems?  I see several:
<OL>
<LI>The machine should have told him on its display that it couldn't
accept any more bills, after he inserted the first bill.
<LI>Instructions should have been displayed on the machine or on a
placard within sight of the machine, explaining the machine's
behavior when it runs out of dollar coins.
<LI>Better yet, there should be a light on the machine, with the words,
"When lit, only one bill per purchase will be accepted, and money
deposited into machine must be less than one dollar above purchase
price of desired item," and it should be lit at the right time.
<LI>The woman "in charge of" the machine should have a clue about how
it works.  I suspect that the USPS just wheels the machines into
Post Offices, sets them down, says, "Here you go, a new vending
machine!" and then periodically comes back to empty the money and
restock them.  Perhaps they should invest a little in training at
least one person at each Post Office to know how the machines work.
<LI>The USA really needs a dollar coin in common circulation :-).

The Manchester Guardian Weekly (week ending 21 Jan 1995) reported that plans
for the UK national ID card system was found in a government surplus store.
The second-hand file cabinet was sold for about 35 pounds.  It contained
memos on investigation into the feasibility of smart-card technology, a
detailed card design, as well as cabinet level letters exchanged on this
topic.  Whitehall has confirmed that the files are authentic.

Did he steal jobs, thanks to call forwarding?
Police say plumber grabbed rivals' calls   <I>[Abstracted starkly by PGN]</I>
<P>
Michael Lasch, a plumber in Levittown, NY, is accused of calling Bell
Atlantic to order Ultra Call-Forwarding for at least five of his company's
competitors, which enabled him remotely to redirect their calls to his
phone.  He was charged with theft by deception, criminal attempt, unlawful
use of a computer, criminal trespass and impersonating an employee.  The
scam was detected when a customer complimented another firm on work
performed over Christmas weekend -- when in fact no one had been working!

  [...]  There is nothing new about this crime - except the use of a new
medium to hijack a channel of communications.  The risks are obvious - as
more such services are available without verification the more this crime
can occur.  I suppose that if Lasch were more sophisticated he could have
kept up his scheme for much longer.  For example, if the ultra-forwarding
were flexible enough he could enable it for the coldest days, in order to
fill up his queue with work orders for frozen pipes, and then disabling the
forwarding while he completed the jobs.

<P>
America Online allows its user accounts to specify up to five "screen
names", which uniquely identify the user.  AOL screen names consist of a
capital letter followed by two to nine alphanumerics or spaces.  The screen
name is not case-sensitive, so "MR SMITH" and "Mr Smith" refer to the same
account, and the AOL software forces uniqueness on new names by appending
digits to the end of the name.
<P>
AOL accounts can also send and receive Internet e-mail.  AOL converts its
screen names to Internet-style addresses by dropping all spaces and
appending "@aol.com", so our "Mr Smith" becomes "<A HREF="mailto:mrsmith@aol.com">mrsmith@aol.com</A>" to the
outside world.
<P>
Which is where I come in.  I was trying to come up with a unique screen name
that did not end in randomly assigned digits -- AOL's membership stands at
1.5 million users, each of whom can reserve up to five names, so most common
English words and names are already taken.
<P>
Idly searching for a name, I requested "root".  (I always put this down as
my first choice when requesting a new account.  It never hurts to ask.)
<P>
The AOL software politely informed me that this name was taken, and said the
same when I requested "postmaster", "webmaster", etc.  In some cases it
suggested an alternative like "webmast236", and in others it simply said
"That name is taken."
<P>
Then I requested "uucp".
<P>
And the software asked me to enter my new password.
<BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
Since then I've been getting a lot of strange e-mail, to put it mildly.
Much of it is private correspondence from external addresses to accounts
on AOL, or vice versa, that has been Cc:'d to uucp.  (I don't know why. 
Is this happening due to user ignorance or carelessness, or is it the
behavior of the mail software?)  In no case so far has the sender
suspected that "<A HREF="mailto:uucp@aol.com">uucp@aol.com</A>" is a live human being.
<P>
The RISK here is the assumption that "uucp" (or, for that matter, "root")
is a trusted e-mail address on the remote machine.  The only required
e-mail address in RFC 822 is "postmaster" -- there is no requirement that
the remote machine use the UUCP transport mechanism, the UNIX operating
system, or that any e-mail address other than "postmaster" route e-mail
to the system administrator.  ("<A HREF="mailto:Postmaster@aol.com">Postmaster@aol.com</A>" does route e-mail to
a person responsible for AOL's mail system, in compliance with RFC 822.)
<P>
AOL reserves certain screen names to prevent this kind of confusion, but
"uucp" was not one of the reserved names.  (Neither was "nuucp", if you
were curious -- I've reserved that one too.  I think I can retire both
addresses permanently by deleting the screen names from my account, but
I plan to make certain before doing so.)  "<A HREF="mailto:Root@aol.com">Root@aol.com</A>" and "webmaster"
are already in use, but I can't say *who* is using them.
<P>
Of course these RISKs apply to any site, not just to AOL -- any site
could have a user account named "uucp" and still be RFC 822 compliant.
But as the net grows, and incorporates more and more diverse machines,
the RISK becomes more dangerous.  Don't assume that mail addressed to
"uucp" or "root" on a remote machine is going to a trusted recipient,
because for at least one large site this assumption isn't true.

Two years ago, i was on sabbatical at a large university, and picked
up some support by teaching a course.  Their division of computing
services managed many computing accounts, and had a pretty reasonable
scheme for class accounts.  They used a 3 letter followed by 3 digit
account names.  The first two letters denoted the department, and the
third letter was a for the first course, b for the second course, etc.
000 was always the instructor's account and 001 was student 1, 002
student 2, etc.  A reasonably sane idea.  I would guess that at the
end of each semester they cleaned student accounts by deleting all
files and reinserting initialization files.  They would then generate
new passwords for all accounts each semester.  What is the risk?
accounts may have state data that does not appear in the account or
that is not normally cleansed.
<P>
The course i was teaching was on a machine i did not use for my
personal work, so i had set up automatic mail forwarding to my machine
here that I normally read mail on (by telnet from there when i was
there).  The between semester cleansing algorithm did not reset that
forwarding address.  Finally, the 5th course in the department again
used that same machine, so account cse000 became the instructor's
account.  That instructor has apparently given the students a "use
e-mail" assignment, and did not test the system with a self mailing.
<P>
Since the forwarding is still in effect, I have been receiving
electronic mail intended for this instructor for the past few days.
I thought of sending him/her email to let him/her know about this,
but realized that such mail would immediately be forwarded to me.
I thought of replying to the students, but if they are just learning
about computers, that would also be fruitless.  I thought of logging
into the account to unset the forward, but the new instructor has
obviously changed the password.  I suppose I could have chosen to just
wait until some interested party finds this in risks, or watch from
the sideline until confusion reigns.  I believe I have identified the
instructor, and have sent her email.  A blind copy of this note to
risks is being sent to a friend at that institution who will, no
doubt, follow up with the instructor and keep me (and perhaps risks
readers) posted on how this shakes out.

This morning I was sitting at my home terminal, reading mail.  I got up for
a few minutes.  When I returned to the terminal, the screen showed a partial
reply to the last message I had been reading.  It looked something like
this:
<BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
It didn't take me long to figure out what had happened.  This particular
terminal has function keys that can be set to store strings.  Once upon a
time I often used a machine named `redbone,' the name of which was therefore
stored in that function key.  Sitting on the table, next to the keyboard,
was one of my two big, fluffy cats.  She had evidently pressed that function
key and the mailer interpreted the `r' of `redbone' as a request to reply to
the message.  After that, she must have spent some time sitting on the `2'
key.
<P>
Oh well, at least she didn't try to eat the mouse.

<P>
My stamp machine story is similar to that of Jonathan Kamens in <A HREF="/Risks/16.76.html">RISKS-16.76</A>
in that the machine was programmed to keep the person using the machine from
losing money.  It is different in that it let me get into a situation where
I could neither buy the stamps I wanted, nor could it give me my money back.
<P>
There is a stamp machine in the basement of one of the buildings in our 
corporate campus, we also have a U.S. Post Office in our backyard, but if 
you're lazy or in a hurry, it's simpler to use the machine.
<P>
Anyway, I wanted to buy a book of stamps (back when they were still a bargain
at $5.80 for the book of 20).  I decided to go to the stamp machine.  Now, I
had $6.00 with me--a five and a one.  There was a sign on the machine saying
that the machine would give back no more than $.50 in change.  I took this 
sign to mean that I could put in more money if I wanted, but the most change
I could get for overpayment would be $.50.
<P>
Anyway, for some reason, I decided that I wanted to get a quarter back, rather
than two dimes.  I would put in $6.05, get $5.80 worth of stamps, and get a 
quarter back.  Most candy vending machines will let you do this, but you have
to put your change in first, before the bills--otherwise they know that you're 
overpaying and won't let you put the coins in.  I started off with a nickel.
I then put the $1 bill in.  So far, so good.  I then attempted to put the five
in.  The machine just wouldn't accept it.  I can't remember what message the 
machine gave me, but it was not enlightening.  After trying 5-10 times to get 
it to take the bill, I reached the conclusion that it just wasn't taking five
dollar bills today (since my bill was in pristine condition).  It also wouldn't
let me get back the money I'd already put into the machine.  Since I was stuck
with either losing my money or getting change and hoping I would finally get 
my stamps, I left the machine and dashed upstairs to our credit union to get 
change for the five.
<P>
Luckily, there was no line, so I got my five $1 bills and ran back downstairs.
The money was still registered in the machine, so I proceeded to feed my $1
bills in.  Everything went fine until I got to the fifth bill--which the machine
refused to take.  Once again, the bill was in perfect shape.  After trying a 
bunch more times, I realized that I would need exact change, so I walked down 
to the change machine in one of the break rooms to get the bill broken into
coins..
<P>
Unfortunately, it took too long to get the coins and I arrived back at the
machine just in time to see it finish telling me I had taken too long and reset
itself, removing all traces of my money from the display.
<P>
As you have probably deduced by now, the machine had been programmed to not 
allow a person to put more than the next highest dollar amount into the machine
from the purchase price of the stamps.  Since all of the denominations of 
stamps were between $(X).50 and $(X+1).00 [books of $.29 stamps were $2.90 and
$5.80 and post card stamps were $1.90 or $3.80], the machine assumed that anyone
putting in more than the next dollar would risk losing money--something they
*clearly* would not want to do, since they would lose money.  (Never mind that
they would also lose the money they'd put in up to this point since once the 
bills go into the machine they don't come back out.)  The sign about getting a 
maximum of $.50 back was misleading since the machine gave no opportunity to 
lose that much.
<P>
Luckily the Post Office refunded my money without any hassle, but I still wish 
whoever programmed the machine hadn't thought they were being so damn clever.

As a frequent reader of the RISKS forum, I was very interested when
"Computer-Related Risks" (our esteemed moderator's new book) was reviewed
here. Using the information from the review, I faxed an order to ACM.
<P>
Two months later, with no book, I discovered that ACM had debited my credit
card for $34.50, rather than the $22.25 + shipping that I was expecting. It
seemed that not only did I not have the book, the book I didn't have wasn't
even the one I wanted.
<P>
I called ACM and discovered that whoever processed my order completely
ignored the title and author information in my fax and went right for the
6-digit order number, which it turns out was incorrect.  (Interestingly
enough, the order number identified a book on software quality.) I hadn't
received the wrong book because it was out of stock (I had received no
notification of this, either).
<P>
The lessons? Overworked order entry people will enter an order number
and simply ignore the accompanying description, even though the
description is much more likely to be correct. And next time I'll be
sure to check the order number directly with ACM, or leave it off.

  For the past 10 years the Annual Computer Security Applications Conference
has been helping the IT community meet these challenges by providing a forum
for information exchange that is unsurpassed.  The Conference will explore a
broad range of technology applications with security and safety concerns.
Technical papers, panels, vendor presentations, and tutorials that address
the application of computer security and safety technologies in the civil,
defense, and commercial environments are solicited.  Selected papers will be
those that present examples of in-place or attempted solutions to these
problems in real applications; lessons learned; and original research,
analyses, and approaches for defining the computer security issues and
problems.  Of particular interest are papers that present descriptions of
secure systems in use or under development, presenting general strategy,
methodologies for analyzing the scope and nature of integrated computer
security issues, and potential solutions.  Papers will be judged for best
paper awards.  A prize will be given for the Outstanding Conference Paper
and the Best Student Paper.  For the Best Student Paper, expenses to attend
the conference will also be awarded .
<P>
  Panels of interest include those that present alternative or controversial
viewpoints or those that encourage lively discussion of relevant issues.
Panels that are simply a collection of unrefereed papers will not be
selected.
<P>
  Vendor presentations of interest should emphasize innovative product
implementations, especially implementations involving the integration of
multiple products.  Vendor presentations that simply describe product
features will not be selected.

appropriateness of the panel for this conference, and should identify panel
participants and their respective viewpoints.  Send 5 copies of your
completed Papers and Panel proposals to Dr. Gary Smith (papers from Europe
should be sent to Klaus Keus) by May 31, 1995.  For panel/forum preparation
instructions, please contact Jody Heaney at (703) 883-5837 or via e-mail at
<A HREF="mailto:heaney@smiley.mitre.org">heaney@smiley.mitre.org</A>.  Send five copies of your vendor presentation
proposal to Steve Rome.  Vendor presentation proposals should include an
abstract that describes the product and example applications.  Send one copy
of your tutorial proposal to Daniel Faigin.  It should consist of one- to
two-paragraph abstract of the tutorial, an initial outline of the material
to be presented, and an indication of the desired tutorial length (full day
or half day).  Electronic submission of tutorial proposals is preferred.
<P>
  Authors will be required to certify prior to June 30, 1995, that all
necessary clearances for public release have been obtained; that the author
or qualified representative will be presented at the conference to deliver
the paper, and that the paper has not been accepted or previously published
elsewhere.  Authors will be notified of acceptance by August 1, 1995.
Camera-ready copies are due not later than September 30, 1995.

<H5>Instructions to Students:</H5>

  Student papers must be authored 100% by students; no faculty authors are
permitted.  Send 5 copies of student papers to Dr.  Gary Smith; please
identify your paper as "Authored by Student."  Contact Ravi Sandu, Student
Paper Award Chair, to ensure that your paper is considered for the Best
Student Paper Award.  This award includes expenses to allow the student to
travel to the conference and present the paper.

<P>
JERUSALEM, Jan 30 (Reuter) - An Israeli rabbi has banned cellular
telephones and pagers from synagogues, saying they interfered
with worshippers' communication with God.
<P>
Rabbi Mordechai Eliahu, a renowned sage and a former chief rabbi
of the Jewish state, published the edict on Monday.

Interestingly, the cell phones are called, "Miracle Phones."

Unknown attackers interrupted, Wednesday Feb.1,1995, 7 glas fibre cables
near Frankfurt/Main airport. As parts of the cables were cut out, about
15.000 telephone lines were interrupted. The cables also carried data for
Lufthansa's booking computers; consequently, new reservations had to be made
manually.  As Lufthansa's main computers (installed at Frankfurt airport)
were cut off for some time, delays of up to 30 minutes were caused.
According to diverse German media, police has no information about
backgrounds of this criminal attack.

<P>
I was recently asked to participate in an opinion survey feedback to
management in order for them to compare their own views, superior views,
peer views, and subordinate views.  This data is then to be used by the
reviewee as a self improvement tool.
<P>
In order to get honest feedback, a commercial P.C. software package
called "2020" was used as a survey tool.  This package is supposed to
protect your anonymity.  It also uses a user supplied password on each
diskette to prevent anyone reading your responses.  The responses are
then collected by a master program and combined with everyone else's
responses.  Only the combined result is seen, individual responses are
not ever seen or tracked.  At least, that's the theory.
<P>
Since privacy and encryption have been a long time interest of mine, I
decided to take a look at the files.
<P>
The first thing I saw was that both my name and my reviewee's name were
embedded in the data area.
<P>
The next thing I saw was that free form comments were stored in clear ascii.
You lose the formatting, but any file viewer could see the comments.
<P>
I used a hex editor to change some of the comments then reinvoked the
program to see if it would detect the changes.  It never noticed a thing.
It obviously didn't use a digital signature or even a simple checksum.
<P>
The cherry on top was the password.  It only uses 0-9 &amp; A-Z (uppercase).
The password was stored encrypted: down-1 and backward.  Thus a password of
"simple6" was stored as "5DKOLHR".  This took me all of the commercial
breaks while watching Star Trek Voyager to find and figure out.
<P>
The net result was that I chose not to participate in the anonymous feedback
survey.

<P>
Today I received an interesting letter from NYNEX (nee NY Telephone, 
the local telephone service provider in NY City):
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  Our records indicate that you requested All-Call Restrict Service on your
  telephone line...
<P>
  During a recent system check, we discovered that All-Call Restrict Service
  was not in place on some lines which it had been requested.  We are in the
  process of checking every All-Call Restrict line and correcting this
  problem where it exists.  As soon as we complete the checking and
  correction process, we will confirm the status of All-Call Restrict on
  your line through a special notification.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
In other words, you might have thought you had Caller-ID disabled when you
make calls from your line, because you ordered it and NYNEX sent you a
confirmation notice six or seven months ago, but unless you independently
verified that it was in place, you might have been sending your number all
this time.
<P>
I can tell whether my line is sending caller-ID because I can call a friend
with a display and ask him.  But as usual, there is no way the local telco
can tell you what your lines settings are.  Call the billing office, and
they will describe what you have ordered and what was reported to have been
installed, but what is actually on the line?
<P>
It would be nice if you could dial a number and have a voice robot read back
to you the settings actually in place -- surely this is possible with
today's digital exchanges, if anyone thought to implement it.  Given how
many different settings you can have with today's phone lines in the USA
(call forwarding, speed dialing, send or don't send Caller ID, choice of
long distance carrier, etc), we already need it.

<P>
So reported the Schenectady, New York Gazette on 2/1/95.  The report said
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   Now, [Nynex] has discovered that All-Call Restrict feature doesn't
   always work.  "The company is indicating to our staff that roughly
   between 10 percent and 15 percent of people who believe they have
   All-Call blocking may have a situation where it doesn't work."
<P>
   That means as many as 82,500 people's numbers are being divulged
   when the think those numbers are being blocked.
<P>
   Nynex officials say they are investigating the problem and
   should have a cause identified sometime next week.
<P> 
   "After this, one of the important things we'll do after we
   identify the cause is implement new processes that will prevent
   this from happening again."
<P>
   New England Telephone, Nynex's subsidiary, is checking to make
   sure its call blocking is working.
<P>
   The problem was revealed by an Albany man who depends on 
   anonymity for hit livelihood.  He tried for weeks to convince
   Nynex that his call blocking was not working, only to be told
   it was.  Eventually [the man] took his story to the local press.
<P>
   The company's routine maintenance tests in its 600 central
   switching offices hadn't discovered this glitch.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
To me the risk here is the arrogance that allows people to argue that such
large complex, distributed systems can ever be built flawlessly.  Any claim
that the system will always protect the customers privacy is fatuous.  It
happened already and it will certainly happen again sometime somewhere.

<P>
This is the first-released of at least three books on PGP (Pretty Good
Privacy), the encryption and authentication package by Phil Zimmerman.  It
covers the concepts of encryption, public key encryption, authentication and
key management, as well as the installation and operation of PGP on MS-DOS and
Macintosh platforms.  There is also some overview of front end shells for DOS
and Windows, plus helpful supplementary information on password/phrase choice
key servers, and where to get PGP.  (The promise of coverage for Windows, UNIX,
OS/2 and Amiga in the promotional literature is overkill, but these interfaces
will be almost identical to those covered.)
<P>
Stallings' material is generally very clear and well written.  Many times,
however, concepts are introduced early in the book but not explained until much
later.  This is particularly true of key management.  In most cases, I can
assure the reader not to worry--all will be made clear, eventually.  (In some
few cases, the explanation may remain confusing until you actually run the
program.)
<P>
The book echoes the assertion by many that PGP has become the de facto standard
in Internet privacy and authentication.  Certainly no commercial product has
anything like the same range of use.  Full acceptance of PGP, though, has been
hampered by the version incompatibilities and the legal difficulties caused by
the US weapons (!) expert control laws.  Given the touchy nature of this
subject, it is not terribly surprising that both Stallings, and Michael Johnson
in the access document, comment only briefly on the subject.  These passages
are somewhat calming, but hardly calculated to inspire confidence.
<P>
Solid background on the technology, if sometimes disjointed.  Terse, but

<P>
I've recently started using the Seyon terminal program to dial in to my
university account from my home Linux system, and have discovered an
interesting risk that is found in Seyon, and perhaps other terminal
programs.
<P>
One thing I use Seyon for is uploading and downloading files using the
Zmodem protocol. To down load a file, you simply enter "sz filename" on the
host machine, and like magic, the file is downloaded. That is the risk.
Apparently, the sz program used to download files sends some special
character sequence that Seyon is set up to recognize, and then automatically
start the download. While this makes downloading nice and easy, it is
entirely possible that this sequence could take place without the user
noticing what was happening - there are no confirmations from the user
required for the download to take place.
<P>
It is not hard to imagine someone building a virus based on sending the
Zmodem startup sequence, and then simply downloading a file to the remote
system. I would imagine this could be even embedded into a regular text
posting. Thus a naive or tired or busy user could have some unknown file
downloaded to their system simply by reading some posting.
<P>
I imagine you can configure Seyon to avoid this behavior, but it is
apparently the default mode -- and one that is likely to be used by bunches
of people.  It is likely that other downloading protocols and terminal
emulation programs allow similar actions.  I think it is important to
recognize the risk in this, and at the least, any program that allows
automatic downloading should by default require the user to confirm that it
is OK to proceed. Power users can turn off the confirmation. New and casual
users would have some protection from unintentional downloads.

<P>
Hello.  My name is Bashir Jiwani and I am a graduate student in 
philosophy at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada.  I 
began looking into ethical issues of information technology for a 
course I was taking this past semester.  I have developed an interest in 
these issues and have decided to pursue this interest further.    
To this end I am pleased to announce that with the help and support of the 
UBC Centre for Applied Ethics a new mailing list that is intended for 
discussion of topics in this area has been created.  
<P>
This list is to be different from existing lists in this area in 
several important respects.  
<P>
Firstly, the list is to be moderated.  That is, all submissions to the list
will not automatically be posted to the list members.  Rather, they will
first arrive at the moderator's mailbox.  The moderator will then put
together the various submissions, screening for length and administrative
content, and then send them out to the list subscribers.
<P>
Secondly, and perhaps most importantly, there will be an established agenda
of topics that will serve to guide discussion on the list.  Rather than just
waiting around for something to happen to get people talking, I have put
together a list of topics that the discussion will progress through.  For
each topic I have tried to gather a few relevant articles as background
reading and have placed them at the list's WWW site.  As well I have
prepared some basic notes for each topic that fleshes out some of the issues
that are thought to be of concern.  In this way I have availed myself as the
presenter of these topics.  I have prepared so far presentations in three
topic areas.  My hope is that the role of presenter will be shared with the
members of the group who are interested in specific issues in information
technology ethics and who are willing to put together a small package of
background materials for the group's benefit.  So as we get to the last of
the topics I have set out, I am hoping someone else will have a specific
area of interest and will present this area to the list by sketching some of
the arguments at issue and by locating various articles that will give
participants some background information.
<P>
The third most significant difference is the WWW site that the list is
associated with.  The web site is to serve various functions.  It is to make
available the presenter's background materials either by providing links to
copies which may be located here or at other sites.  The web pages are also
intended to archive list discussions.  As well, any links that members might
feel may be useful can also be set up on these pages through the
administrative moderator.  As I have mentioned, I will be both
administrative moderator and topic presenter for the duration of the first
three discussion topics after which it is my hope that other members will
take on the role of topic presenter and I will refine myself to
administrative duties.
<P>
I believe that the list will be attractive to all users of information 
technology.  The participation of philosophers as well as business 
professionals is especially encouraged.
<P>
Due to the guided nature of the discussion, the list will officially open as
soon as a critical mass of members have signed up.  This mass has been set
at 40.  So as soon as forty people are subscribed to the list, the first set
of moderator's discussion notes will be mailed to all members.
<P>
To subscribe to the list, send the one-word message "subscribe" in the body
of an e-mail message to "<A HREF="mailto:infotech-ethics-request@ethics.ubc.ca">infotech-ethics-request@ethics.ubc.ca</A>".  For a more
detailed description of the list or to access the articles and moderator's
notes on the various topics or just to surf some interesting waves, visit
the web site at url: <A HREF="http://ethics.ubc.ca/people/grads/bashir/infotech.html">http://ethics.ubc.ca/people/grads/bashir/infotech.html</A>.
<P>
Feedback on or about the list can be sent via the web pages or to the 
moderator directly at <A HREF="mailto:infotech-ethics-moderator@ethics.ubc.ca">infotech-ethics-moderator@ethics.ubc.ca</A>.

Third International Workshop on Feature Interactions<BR>
         in Telecommunications Software Systems<BR>
                   Kyoto, Japan<BR>
                October 11-13, 1995
<H4>Description</H4>
This workshop is the third in a series, whose mission is to encourage
researchers from a variety of computer science specialties (software
engineering, enterprise modeling, protocol engineering, distributed
artificial intelligence, formal techniques, software testing, and
distributed systems, among others) to apply their techniques to the feature
interaction problem that arises in building telecommunications software
systems (see the back page for a description of the problem).  We welcome
papers on avoiding, detecting, and/or resolving feature interactions using
either analytical or structural approaches.  Submissions are encouraged in
(but are not limited to) the following topic areas:
<UL>
<LI>Classification of feature interactions.
<LI>Modeling,  reasoning,  and  testing  techniques  for
        detecting feature interactions.

<LI>Software platforms and architecture designs  to  aid
        in avoiding, detecting, and resolving feature interactions.

<LI>Tools  and  methodologies  for  promoting   software
        compatibility and extensibility.

<LI>Mechanisms   for   managing   feature   interactions
        throughout the service life-cyle.

<LI>Management of feature interactions in PCS, ISDN, and
        Broadband services, as well as IN services.

<LI>Management of feature interactions in various of the
        operations   support   functions   such  as  Service
        Negotiation, Service Management, and Service Assurance.

<LI>Feature Interactions and their potential  impact  on
        system Security and Safety.

<LI>Environments  and  automated   tools   for   related
        problems in other software systems.

<LI>Management of Feature Interactions in various  other
        enterprises, such as banking, medicine, etc.
</UL>
<H4>Format</H4>
We hope to promote a dialogue among researchers in various related
areas, as well as the designers and builders of telecommunications software.
To this end, the workshop will have sessions for paper presentations,
including relatively long discussion periods.  Panel discussions and tool
demonstrations are also planned. The first day of the workshop, October 11,
is devoted to tutorials and discussions on areas related to feature
interactions.
<H4>Attendance</H4>
Workshop attendance will be limited to 100 people.  Attendance will be
by invitation only. Prospective attendees are asked to submit either a paper
(maximum 5000 words) or a single page description of their interests and how
they relate to the workshop.  Proposals for tutorials and discussions are
also requested (maximum 3000 words). About 16-20 of the attendees will be
asked to present talks; a small number of tutorials and/or discussions will
also be selected.  We will strive for an equal mix of theoretical results
and practical experiences. Papers will be published in a conference
proceedings.

<H4>Workshop Statement</H4>
The feature interaction problem is a major obstacle to the rapid
deployment of new telephone services. Some feature communications system.
Telecommunications software is huge, real-time, and distributed; adding new
features to a telecommunication system, like adding new functionalities to
any large software system, can be very difficult.  Each new feature may
interact with many existing features, causing customer annoyance or total
system breakdown.  Traditionally, interactions were detected and resolved on
a feature by feature basis by experts who are knowledgeable on all existing
features.  As the number of features grows to satisfy diverse needs of
customers, managing feature interactions in a single administrative domain
is approaching incomprehensible complexity.  In a future marketplace where
features deployed in the network may be developed by different operating
companies and their associated vendors, the traditional approach is no
longer feasible.  How to detect, resolve, or even prevent the occurrence of
feature interactions in an open network is now an important research issue.
<P>
The feature interaction problem is not unique to telecommunications
software; similar problems are encountered in any long-lived software system
that requires frequent changes and additions to its functionality.
Techniques in many related areas appear to be applicable to the management
of feature interactions.  Software methodologies for extensibility and
compatibility, for example, could be useful for providing a structured
design that can prevent many feature interactions from occurring.  Features
are typically design to suit the purposes of a user or business, hence
Enterprise modeling will play a role in the identification of certain
classes of interaction, in particular the solution of an interaction in one
enterprise may not be desired by another.  Formal specification,
verification, and testing techniques, being widely used in protocol
engineering and software engineering, contribute to the detection of
interactions.  Several causes of the problem, such as aliasing, timing, and
the distribution of software components, are similar to issues in
distributed systems.  Cooperative problem solving, a promising approach for
resolving interactions at run time, resembles distributed planning and
resolution of conflicting subgoals among multiple agents in the area of
distributed artificial intelligence.  This workshop aims to provide an
opportunity for participants to share ideas and experiences in their
respective fields, and to apply their expertise to the feature interaction
problem.

<P>
The "Washington Post" reported in Saturday's edition (4 Feb 95) that the
Virginia legislature is considering a law requiring that companies notify
customers if the software they sell has a self-disabling feature (e.g.,
after some period of time).  The article was sketchy, but it's intended to
head off people developing software and then demanding ransom to prevent the
software from self-destructing.  The law would not *ban* such features, just
require that they be disclosed.
<P>
The RISK?  Does informing people that the software is self-disabling
encourage them to try to subvert the feature?  And if someone did and
that triggered the disable feature, would that come under the law?
And what if it were used in safety critical systems: "I'm sorry, but
the license period on the software in your heart monitor has expired.
Please contact the vendor to reenable."

<P>
Under the heading "CELLULAR PHONE SECURITY", EDUPAGE of 5 Feb 1995 mentions
a *Wall Street Journal* article dated 3 Feb 1995 that states Cellular One of
New York and New Jersey is starting to require new customers to enter a
four-digit security code before placing calls.
<P>
This is in an effort to curtail cellular fraud, which is quoted as being 
$482 million (3.7% of the industry's revenue) in 1994.
<P>
NYNEX began such a program last fall. I spoke with a NYNEX sales
representative who told me the new system changes channels after a user
enters the phone number and presses "Send". The four-digit PIN code is sent
on a new frequency, and would-be ESN thieves now have the added task of
determining which PIN goes with which ESN.
<P>
However, if your cellular telephone is equipped with a recall feature,
pressing "RCL" displays, not the telephone number you've just dialed, but

	RTw  02/05 0107  Japanese bank workers steal 140 million yen by PC
<P>
	TOKYO, Feb 5 (Reuter) - A Japanese bank employee and two computer 
	operators have been arrested and charged with allegedly using a 
	personal computer money transfer system to steal 140 million yen
	($1.4 million), police said on Sunday.
<P>
	Police said the 140 million yen was illegally sent in December 
	last year from Tokai Bank Ltd to an account in another bank 
	using a settlement system operated by personal computers. It 
	was withdrawn the same day.
<P>
	The following day, a total of 1,490 million yen ($14.9 million) 
	was sent from Tokai Bank to accounts in several other banks using 
	the same system. But this time the fraud was discovered before 
	any withdrawals could be made.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
According to the article, the suspects include employees of the bank systems
group and a computer services supplier.  It seems that the scheme was driven
in part by debts owed to organized crime groups.

<P>
The LA Times had an article about road pricing in Singapore:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  Charles P. Wallace, Singapore in high-tech tangle to fight automobile
  gridlock, Los Angeles Times, 3 February 1995, page A5.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The story is that Singapore's streets are rapidly becoming jammed with cars,
and so the authoritarian government is trying to impose a road-pricing
scheme based on automatic vehicle identification (AVI).  "Road pricing"
means that every road, or at least every frequently clogged road, is a toll
road.  "AVI" means that your car carries a device that can be "pinged" by a
radio signal from a roadside beacon, whereupon it broadcasts a number (its
own serial number in most versions, but perhaps the car's identification
number) that allows a charge to be made to an account.  The LA Times article
is basically sympathetic to the government's position despite the
straightforward coercion that the system involves.  It pays no attention to
privacy issues.  The only existing AVI toll-collection system mentioned is
the voluntary Telepass system in Italy.
<P>
The basic argument behind road-pricing is a familiar market argument: when
people can travel on roads for free, they naturally do so at a higher rate
than if they had to pay the actual costs of providing roads.  Road pricing,
on this model, seeks to establish the most efficient level of road usage by
letting people decide how much it's worth to them to drive.
<P>
In practice this argument generally runs afoul of reality in several ways:
<OL>
<LI> Road pricing schemes have generally required the collection of large
amounts of data about individuals' travel patterns.  So long as this data 
is accumulating, pressures to use it for other purposes, from marketing to
repression, are more or less inevitable.  Digital cash payment schemes might
alleviate this problem, but so far as I am aware they have not been seriously
proposed, much less implemented.

<LI>Unless you actually privatize the roads, in practice a "road price" 
is really a tax whose levels are set not by a market but by a legislature.
One might argue that this is fine in a properly functioning democracy, but
people often don't see it that way.  A road-pricing scheme in Hong Kong 
failed a while back due in part to anti-tax sentiments.

<LI> It's very difficult to establish a proper competitive market in roads,
since in most areas it's an industry with extremely high barriers to entry.

<LI> The whole geography of many countries -- maybe not Singapore, but
certainly the United States -- has been shaped by the availability of free
road travel.  Introducing road pricing at this late date would cause great
economic disruption.  The resulting process would actually be very interesting
to watch, and in the very long run might even reverse the flight from cities
into the suburban sprawl.  But it would be very messy.

<LI> When it costs money to drive on roads, the poor cannot legally drive.
When you're looking for a job, free roads are one of those little subsidies
that keep the wolves from the door.
</OL>
Enormous intelligent vehicle-highway systems (IVHS) including AVI-based toll
collection are coming to most of the world.  Singapore is the exception in
declaring that the systems will be mandatory.  But do you really believe
that the IVHS in your region will remain voluntary?  Will your insurance
company require you to sign up for it?  Will the availability of AVI
encourage your local bureaucrats, faced with intractable budgetary woes, to
propose road pricing schemes for the two dozen most overburdened roads in
your region?  Will you still refuse to sign up for the system when the
alternatives are traveling strictly on free roads or stopping to pay
thirteen tolls every day?  These are questions worth thinking about now,
before IVHS technical standards are established and deployment decisions get
set in stone.

	WP   02/06  Dial and Save's Word-of-Mouth Toll;<BR>
	Chantilly Long-Distance Firm Battles False Rumors of 
	Free Service to Cuba 
<P>
	By Kara Swisher, Washington Post Staff Writer  
<P>
	Executives at Dial and Save, a small long-distance company 
	in Chantilly, never thought they would have something in 
	common with corporate giants such as Procter &amp; Gamble Co. 
	and Kentucky Fried Chicken Corp.  But recently the firm became 
        a member of that unfortunate group of companies zapped by 
        untrue rumors that spread out of control.  ... Dial and Save 
        is contending with thousands of angry customers who say they 
        thought that certain calls placed through its network were free.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
According to the author, over 10,000 people in the Miami area thought they
were getting free calls to Cuba--and they placed over $2 million in calls in
a few weeks.  Now people are reacting to unexpected bills (some as high as
$10,000).
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	The furious callers insisted that they had placed the calls 
	only because they had heard they were using free test lines. 
	Customers said they would never have made the calls if they 
	had known the costs; they had believed that Dial and Save's 
	access number was the code for a free ride to reach their 
	relatives in Cuba.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The article continues with an extensive discussion of the public-relations
nightmare caused by the angry customers (or perhaps I should say, "would-be
non-customers") over their unexpected bills.  In addition, the company
has felt obliged to hire 20 extra Spanish-speaking operators to handle
the thousands of angry calls they are currently receiving.
<P>
[Comments by MK:  I don't want to discuss the possible motivations of
people claiming they expected free service by calling an access number.
My reason for posting this fairly low-tech story is to illustrate the
economic consequences of a simple rumour.  Now imagine this rumour
spreading through cyberspace, aided by anonymous postings and repostings
in innumerable news groups, e-mail messages and bulletin board systems.
<P>
This story reminds me of the lament recently posted by an anonymous 
executive in _Network World_ 11(49):41 (94.12.05) entitled, "Ad leads to 
a nightmare on Cyber-Street."  This poor fellow spammed the Net in a
small way and got a slew of nastygrams e-mail and was publicly pilloried 
in many news groups.
<P>
Unfortunately, "someone uploaded a message to most of the alt.sex groups 
that listed my company's two 800 numbers as phone sex lines."  The 
consequences of _that_ rumour were horrendous:  flooded phone lines,
angry and embarrassed receptionists, and complete humiliation of the
naive Internet advertiser.
<P>
Now, such childish pranks have already had expensive consequences, yet
they are as nothing compared to the potential for economic terrorism
posed by anonymity and pseudonymity on the Internet.  As yet, I think, 
only some people on the Net have internalized the appropriate level of
skepticism about _any_ information gleaned from the Internet, let alone
about _anonymous_ postings.  With a growth rate estimated by some at 10%
_per month_ in the number of people using IDs that can access the Internet,
we will see a natural increase in credulous newcomers.  If thousands of
people can believe that a phone-sex service would use an 800 number (or
that a commercial phone service supplier would make free long-distance
calls available), I think millions of people will be prepared to believe
all sorts of other nonsense--and, alas for the victims, act upon those
mistaken beliefs.
<P>
So what are we gonna do, eh?  Even my usual leitmotiv (We need
non-repudiatable identification and authentication for access to the
Internet -- etc. etc. etc.) fails: the people using the "free" access codes
for calls to Cuba were tracked unerringly by their normal phone company
accounts.  No doubt the gullible seekers after, ah, aural sex were equally
traceable--but so what?  The damage was done regardless of non-repudiation.
<P>
I dunno what we're going to do.  Any ideas?]

Two items have recently become news in the PNW. One, we had an earthquake
centered in Tacoma. According to articles in the Tacoma News-Tribune, the
Seattle Post-Intelligencer, and The Daily Olympian, all three counties 911
systems were knocked out due to people calling to see if there had been an
earthquake, or to get information about the quake. All three articles
mentioned very high call volumes; the Seattle article mentioned 350 calls in
the first 10 minutes after the quake.
<P>
The RISKS are obvious. As a denial of service attack, this was perfect.
Hundreds of well-meaning people (like rubberneckers on the information
superhighway?) slowed or stopped vital services from being delivered.  All
three counties exhorted people to only call 911 after you have been hurt in
an earthquake.
<P>
As an aside, I got on the net and hit
<A HREF="gopher://geophys.washington.edu:79/0quake">gopher://geophys.washington.edu:79/0quake</A> and had instant, up-to-date
information. Much better than what was available on the radio or TV.
Perhaps if someone made a VMB that recited the most recent event to
all callers? Then we could lose access to one switch somewhere,
instead of to the 911 switch.

They go on to talk about how he didn't know how to remove himself from

BayBank, a Massachusetts chain, has recently started offering "linked
accounts."  For example, a recent ad shows the former hockey player, Bobby
Orr, using his telephone to transfer money from his account to his son's.  I
figured it would be neat to have something in common with Bobby Orr, so I
had them set up the same thing for me and my daughter who's at U. Mass.
Before setting up the link, my accounts, as shown at ATM machines or over
the phone, were identified as "savings" and "checking."
<P>
BayBank has a feature which they call "custom account names."  You might
think this means you can pick any name you want, but what it actually means
is that you can select from a list of about a hundred names, with highly
personalized choices like "daughter 1" and "son 2."  The BayBank rep who set
up my account suggested the "custom" names "my checking," "daughter's
checking," "my savings," and "daughter's savings," which sounded sensible to
me.
<P>
The first time I tried to be like Bobby Orr, here's what the confirmation
dialog I got over the phone was: "Seventy dollars have been transferred from
your my savings account to your daughter's checking account.  The reference
number for this transaction is one thousand eight hundred and four."  This
caused me to say "huh?" three times.  The (British?) grammar of "seventy
dollars have" isn't bad; I would have preferred that the transaction number
be read as "one eight zero four;" but the phrase "your my savings account"
stopped me cold.
<P>
So, next month my daughter gets her bank statement and, yep, you guessed it:
her statement shows this as "BayBank XP24 Transfer From BB Boston My
Savings."  See, it's my daughter's statement, but it's not _her_ my savings,
it's _my_ my savings.

You think *you've* got problems...
<P>
We have three little furry friends.  The other morning (about 5 am) I was
obliged to remove one of them from my bedroom in response to demands for
food.  Said mammal was carried to the kitchen and fed in an attempt to get
some more sleep.
<P>
On the return trip to my room I was alerted by the distinctive sound of the
dial tone from the `handsfree' phone in my study.  Then I heard it dial...
<P>
It had only rung twice by the time I cancelled the call (it's a long hall,
ok? :-).  It appears that the kitten was asleep in the empty paper box on
the corner of my desk and had been aroused by the sound of cat biscuits
hitting the food bowl.  In the process of heading for the easy way off my
desk (via my chair) he had managed to stand on my phone and take advantage
of the `one-touch hands-off dialing' facility.
<P>
Later that morning I used the redial function to see who had been disturbed
and to apologise profusely for the obscenely early call.  Luckily, the
recipients were somewhat amused and quite forgiving.
<P>
There is now an empty box over my phone whenever I'm not sitting right next
to it...

<P>
There was an article on the business page of the "Tagespiegel" this morning
on the problems plaguing the German railway company. I had meant to post the
problems to risks when it began, but you know how it goes.... So anyway, it
is now the fourth month that the railway has not correctly met its payroll
because of software problems and the natives, er, workers are rather
restless.
<P>
The railway has just recently been privatized and the employees transferred
from civil service to private contracts. Calculating a civil service payroll
in Germany is not for the faint at heart, there are all sorts of little
additions and deductions. The unions had insisted that the pay remain more
or less the same, and worked out a new, different but still complicated
schedule of pay adjustments. Now the fun begins.
<P>
Some people don't get paid at all. One who now longer works for the railway
received a notice that he owes them 1.61 DM. Many people that normally make
3000-4000 DM a month receive only 900. And then there are the apprentices
who normally make just 1000 a month - they seem to be getting somewhere on
the order of 15000 DM a month... interestingly enough, the Bahn manages to
call the overpayments back lickety split. The other direction is not so
easy. Last month they offered to give everyone 2000 DM extra until
everything gets straightened out. That didn't work either, with some being
asked to pay the Bahn money and others having big payroll deductions wipe
most of it out.
<P>
What did the Bahn do? Amazingly, this is being programmed in-house. And since
there is no responsible leader of the programming department (!), they 
have hired someone for that job (probably so that they can fire him next
month...). "It's just a software problem" they say. And the payroll is so
large, it cannot be done by hand. Employees are being asked to keep track of
what they get and what they think they should get.
<P>
[Ah, did I mention, they jacked up the prices for travelling by train the
beginning of February? That's another story, but I think I know what they
need the money for now....]

I noticed an interesting AP newswire story in the LA Times Business section
(p. D2) on January 31, 1995.  The only problem was that it appeared to have
a final paragraph from a much earlier story appended to the end.  The
phrasing matched well enough that it took a while to realize that we did
not, indeed, invade Japan over the issue.  I enclose the last two
paragraphs:
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
   ...<BR>
      Some of the increas in Japan reflects the decline value of the
  dollar against the yen, and the effect of Japan's higher wageds is
  offset by generally higher prices for consumer goods.
<P>
      Indeed, the U.S. forces that begin landing on the island today
  will depend explicitly on Cedras' cooperation for their success.  One
  of the first tasks of the commander of the U.S. expeditionary force,
  Lt. Gen. Henry Hugh Shelton, will be an official call on Cedras.

<P>
The Wednesday, 8 Feb 1995, International Herald Tribune has a very short
item on "Portuguese Plastic".  The AP picture shows a pair of open hands
holding both a few pretty coins and a single less pretty smart card.
<P>
The card has snappy graphics (including a picture of coins) and I count
about 9-electrical contact pads for getting at the smarts.
<P>
Some details:
<UL>
<LI> "Spending limit of $375".  (Presumably 60,000 Escudos.)
<LI> "Does not have a user's name on it".
<LI> "Requires no secret codes".
<LI> It can have new value put in it using an automatic teller machine.
<LI> Written on the card is: "Porta Moedas Multibanco" and "Caixa Geral 
    de Depositos".
<LI> The picture seems to show a dark fuzzy printed serial number, 
    maybe 12-digits long.
<LI> For incidental purchases, merchants' readers will be cheap and 
   autonomous if it really can be used to buy "newspapers, 
    cigarettes, or a cup of coffee".
</UL>
Missing Details:
<UL>
<LI> Is the system publicly documented and secure, or is it security 
    through obscurity?
<LI> Does it have the user's name *in* it?  (Is it anonymous, or not?)
<LI> Who issues it?  (Who will get burned if it is hacked?)
<LI> When will it start running?
<LI> What *is* the underlying system?
</UL>
Risks issues?  I think the most interesting will be the public's sense of
the risks, what they are told, and whether they "buy" it.

  My father is a security investigator for a major national
"Less-Than-Truckload" freight carrier.  Recently a string of major shippers
have been hit by weekend thefts up and down the North Atlantic seaboard.
The most recently pilfered items were $270,000 of long distance prepaid
calling cards.  These apparently are gaining acceptance as both a debit card
and/or collectible item depending upon the picture on the card.
<P>
  When the trucking firm contacted the owner of the shipped cards and told 
them of the theft, they had no way of de-activating the stolen cards.  
Even knowing the lot numbers, etc., they do not have the software in place 
to render the cards obsolete.  So goodbye $270,000 in calls, and assuming 
they are sold for 50 cents on the dollar at the Port Authority Terminal, 
hello $135,000 for the bad guys.

<P>
I'm submitting this to illustrate the RISKS of trying to print a document
from a remote laptop through a network and assuming that it will come out on
the right device.
<P>
I work at a small daily newspaper which uses Macs, PCs, and a mainframe in
its network.  In addition to small laser printers and dot-matrix printers we
have output devices that can produce 13 x 21.5" pages on regular paper, "RC"
paper, or film negative.  The film costs $1 per inch of depth so we're
always being admonished to be careful not to waste it.
<P>
We have two reporters who started a self-publishing project last year, a
fiction zine called _Sludgecone_.  They have been using the newspaper's
facilities to produce their camera-ready pages, although their actual
printing was done at a copy shop.
<P>
The other day one of them decided to print out all the raw, unedited copy
(24 pages) for the second issue.  He was at his house with his laptop, and
logged in to our system intending to print them out on 8.5 x 11" paper on
one of the small laser printers.  Unfortunately for him it did not go there,
but rather to film.  Each page came out on 13 x 21.5" film.  24 pages at $1
an inch, with 4 inches between pages, added up to $600 worth of wasted film.
<P>
At this time I don't know what's going to happen but I'd guess that this
unfortunate person and his partner will be forbidden from using the
newspaper facilities to produce _Sludgecone_, and they might have the $600
taken out of their paychecks.

<P>
The following is a summary of a recent personal experience with PacBell.
While I have not seen this precise RISK mentioned in the digest, it is
a variant on a theme familiar to risk readers.
<P>
While reviewing my January residential local phone bill I noticed an
unfamiliar entry under the heading of "Operator and System-Assisted Calls".
Listed under this heading was a short call, marked as a "system assisted 3rd
party call". Both destination and source numbers were listed, but I
recognized neither.
<P>
This afternoon I called the PacBell billing center for an explanation and 
correction.  The service representative, Brian, was straightforward
and polite. He informed me of the following:
<UL>
<LI>This call was made from another residential number, the person who made
  the call simply requested that it be billed to my number.
<LI>When a 3rd-party-billed call is made from a residential number,
  "9 times out of ten the operator making the call will NOT ASK FOR ANY 
  VERIFICATION (emphasis added)" 
</UL>
Let me stress that this was not a case of a pilfered PIN, or "calling card"
number. I have never requested or received a "calling card" from PacBell, so
there there should be no such account number to steal. It would seem that
PacBell simply allows calls to be billed to other numbers with no
verification at all.
<P>
While PacBell offered to credit the call they did not offer to block such
calls until I explicitly asked whether there was any way to prevent the
situation from recurring.
<P>
While I consider myself to be a reasonably well-informed consumer, prior to
this incident I was neither aware of the procedures used for 3rd party
billing, nor of the blocking service available for such calls (at the time I
initially ordered phone service I explicitly requested all blocks that were
then offered).
<P>
With the plethora of phone calling cards with, at least, weak
authentication, third-party billing seems to be a service of little value.
Making such a service available without verification is unconscionable.
<P>
The RISKS of the situation are obvious.

 &gt; I think millions of people will be prepared to believe all sorts of other<BR>
 &gt; nonsense--and, alas for the victims, act upon those mistaken beliefs.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
One problem is that what constitutes "nonsense" is a floating target.  There
are (or have been) for-pay phone-sex lines which operate from 800 numbers,
much to the dismay of concerned parents who have already blocked 900 numbers
on their home phones with the help of their telco and have no way to screen
for 800 numbers, too.  (It should be noted that many telcos are working now
to eliminate this sort of bait-and-switch.)
<P>
It's not unlikely that a commercial phone service could make free
long-distance phone calls available; I've seen booths in shopping malls from
various long distance vendors encouraging you to try a free phone call to
anywhere to check the quality of their phone line.
<P>
The RISK, as with all urban legends, is that of poor authentication --
either of the purported author or of the content of the message.  
Relying on "common sense" in a rapidly changing age is not necessarily
as easy at sounds (if it ever was that easy...).

In <A HREF="/Risks/16.79.html">RISKS-16.79</A> Phil Agre mentioned Digital cash payment schemes for road
tolls but assumed that such systems have not yet been proposed, much less
implemented. Fact is that in Sweden there is an undergoing major national
road toll project which in 1996/97 will introduce such a system, based of
transponders plus smart cards. Cards may be filled with cash at various
places, gas stations etc. Privacy issues are of concern, so a Digital cash
system is necessary; still there remains the potential (risk) for systematic
tracking of travel patterns. This will be of considerable concern from the
Data Inspectorate. The system will be able to make the recording at speeds
around 80 km/h (50 mph). Cars without the right equipment will be
photographed - unless you pay at the manual gate of course.

Comments are welcomed, and a lively debate is anticipated.
<H4>How does the attack scanning process work?</H4>
	We have collected and written a set of attack programs that
automatically probe systems in the same way as many attackers probe them.
When you request an attack, the computer at all.net launches the attack
against the specified machine, logs the results, and E-mails the results out.

<H4>How do you keep this process safe? &lt;/h2&gt;</H4>
	Since the attacks are launched from all.net, we don't give out the
attack code in the process of testing.  The results are E-mail'ed to
<A HREF="mailto:postmaster@the.attacked.machine">postmaster@the.attacked.machine</A> so that only the systems administrator
responsible for dealing with postal problems at the machine under scan gets
the result.  These results are posted along with the identifying information
about the person and site that requested the attack so that the action is
traceable.  Finally, all.net is identified as the source in a separate
posting to the systems administrator of the machine.  All of the attacks are
well known and the programs we use are widely available in source form for
free over the Internet.

<P>

Thieves broke into a van and stole an Oregon woman's ATM card and
discovered her PIN number written on her Social Security card.
They then made repeated withdrawals, covering 100 miles and visiting
48 ATM machines over a three day period. (Friday night - Monday 2 AM)
<P>
They were able to get $346,700 in cash with the help of some 
questionable computer systems.
<OL>
<LI>Ordinarily there is a $200 daily limit for withdrawals, Howver,
"because of a computer program change at the Oregon TelCo Credit
Union, the limit was not in effect that weekend."

<LI>When the account was down to zero, the thieves fed empty deposit
envelopes into the machine and credited the account with bogus 
deposits of $825,000 -- and then made withdrawals against this sum.
</OL>
Technology did work in at least one repect.  At least 5 of the machines
had taken photos of the people using the stolen card. Three persons
are in custody and are facing Federal charges.

I see a number of mistakes/risks here.
<OL>
<LI> Smith wrote left her purse in a van overnight and wrote down her PIN 
   number.
<LI>The bank's software allowed withdrawals of over $200 per day.
<LI> The bank immediately credited someone's account for a deposit - even a
   huge amount like $820,500.  My bank doesn't credit my account until the
   next business day.
<LI>Only about 10% of the ATM machines had hidden cameras.  Had the crooks 
   been a little more lucky, they may have never been caught.
<LI> Karen Smith isn't liable for the theft even though she left her card and
   PIN number unsecured.  I believe that she should shoulder some of the 
      blame and loss.

From the Associated Press news wire via CompuServe's Executive News Service:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	APn  02/06 1228  Sweden-Pedophiles-Internet<BR>
	By THOMAS GINSBERG <BR>
	Associated Press Writer
 <P>
	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Pedophiles have found a home on the 
	Internet and exchange hundreds of pictures a week through 
	anonymous conduits, a researcher said Monday.
<P>
	The statistics provided a glimpse at the scope of the potentially 
	illegal activity, which police fear can lure kids into sex. It 
	came from a study by Mats Wiklund, a researcher at Stockholm 
	University's Institute of Computer and System Science.
<P>
	During a seven-day period in late December and early January, 
	Wiklund counted 5,651 messages or postings about child 
	pornography in four electronic "bulletin boards."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The author makes the following key points:
<UL>
<LI>Many graphics showed what appeared to be "adolescents engaged in
  sexual acts."  A few showed young children, apparently to attract 
  the interest of other pedophiles.

<LI> The messages tracked and counted were a fraction of the total traffic,
  since Wiklund was unable to track private e-mail and scanned only
  about half of the porn-related groups he knew of.

<LI> Most of the pornographic messages were sent through the anonymizing
  server located in Finland.

<LI> The Internet offers advantages to pedophiles:
<BLOCKQUOTE>  
	"The Internet has become a channel of communication for 
	pedophiles," Wiklund said. "From their point of view, they've 
	found a green technology. You can be anonymous and still be 
	reached."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI> Exchanging pornography electronically is a crime in many areas of the
  world:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	In most countries the distribution of child pornography is 
	illegal. Two years ago, U.S. police raided about 40 locations 
	where people were exchanging child pornography by computer. 
	Two Danes were convicted in 1993 of transmitting child 
	pornography to an estimated 6,000 people worldwide.
 </BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI> 85% of the messages Wiklund scanned were fantasies about sex with
  children or technical tips on how to transmit pornographic pictures.

<LI> Law enforcement officials are still unsure of how to handle this
  traffic:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	Finnish detective Sgt. Timo Laine said it was unclear whether 
	the country's laws would apply to "electronic smuggling" by 
	computer. He said did not know whether police would take 
	action against the computer owner in Finland.
<P>
	"We've never had this kind of case before," Laine said. "If 
	I transmit this information through the Internet, is it 
	considered smuggling?"

There was an announcement in misc.kids.computers yesterday that, at first
glance, appeared to be just what it said: ``a communication playground for
children ages 8-12''.  The full text of the announcement is quoted below:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  KidsCom, a communication playground for children ages 8-12 is up and
  running.  Kids can find key pals, get help with Internet questions from an
  Internet guru, talk about what they'd like to be when they grow up, explore
  links to other children's sites, enter sweepstakes to win prizes, and give
  feedback on what they'd like to see and do on the Internet.
 <P>
  <A HREF="http://www.spectracom.com/kidscom/">http://www.spectracom.com/kidscom/</A>
  For more info, please email <A HREF="mailto:kidscom@spectracom.com">kidscom@spectracom.com</A>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
What they didn't mention, however, was that before you can ``play'' you have
to fill out a form that asks for:  name, address, e-mail address, demographic
information, *and a password*!  Some people are already advising kids against
giving out their names and addresses on the Net; this goes *much* farther.
<P>
There are at least two risks here, the most obvious being the risk (almost a
certainty) of ending up on some direct marketer's mailing list.  The other one
is the usual one of sending passwords in the clear: what if the kid has an
account on a Unix system somewhere (mine does, on our Linux box at home), and
what if they use the same password in both places?
<P>
Now, the folks at SpectraCom may simply not have thought about the potential
consequences of what they're doing; their description of the company as
<BLOCKQUOTE> 
 a full service research, strategic planning and communications company that
 specializes in conveying information in an understandable and <EM>actionable</EM> (sic>
 way.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
would seem to indicate as much.  But the same technique could be used by
someone trolling for easy systems to crack.  It would work even better on
adults, of course, and the next bunch might ask for a 4-digit number instead
of a password...
<P>
Hey, kid, want a free lollypop?  Just fill out this form...

another unexpected technological interference with a religious process:

<P>
	ROME, Feb 8 (Reuter) - Even Italians who religiously carry 
	their cellular phones while dining in restaurants or jogging 
	in forests might draw the line against priests using them in 
	the confessional box.

	An Italian Catholic magazine has told priests who own such

It seems the February editorial in _Vita Pastorale_, a monthly magazine 
for parish priests, cited a case in which a woman complained after her
priest's cell phone rang during her confession.

While you're connected to your favorite Web page, it's also connected to
you, and could be copying all sorts of information off your hard drive, say
industry experts. In fact, it happened last year when Central Point
Software used registration software developed by Pipeline Communications,
and inadvertently also gathered descriptions of the users' systems -- the
type of microprocessor, the version of DOS and Windows, the type of display
and mouse, and the amount of free space available on the hard drive.
Customers squawked, and Central Point had Pipeline change the software.
However, Pipeline reports that at least one of its clients is using the
scanning feature now -- but only after getting the owner's permission. The
lesson? "If you can't trust it, don't connect to it." (Forbes 2/13/95

Personally, I have no use for such an account and did not request it (why 
I did not bother to obscure the account number), just one reason being that 
"Security by Obscurity" has been proven not to work in the long term, another 
being that I would consider certain domestic agencies lax if they were not 
monitoring international gozintas and gozoutas.  Of course, on the gripping

With all the outcry about people not knowing what phone calls cost, this is
somewhat related in that people are assumed responsible for knowledge that
is not readily available.
<P>
In a TV "Shame On You" report, it was shown that an entire area of lower
Manhattan, New York is a "Blue Zone" where the curb is SUPPOSED to be
painted blue and have signs that tell that there's no parking and it's a tow
away zone.  Well, there are entire blocks with NO signs or paint on the
curbs.  The traffic department issued tickets from US $55 to $200 if towed.
Appeals are useless as even a reporter with the parking commissioner was
told that "leaflets were distributed".  Yea - back in 1988.  Traffic court
simply found everyone 'guilty'.  So now the leaflets are being distributed,
along with the parking ticket.  So even when there's no notification or
warning, New York City's Parking Violations Bureau doesn't back down and
gets to keep your money.  At least with the phone companies, folks seem to
be getting refunds.
<P>
Now jump to the computer network world.  There are many newcomers spamming
USENET with posting to EVERY newsgroup (some apparently use some script as
they're too thorough to post to EVERY newsgroup so fast, and some even
crosspost to 8-10 groups at a time).  When informed "you should not do
that", some reply "nobody told me it was wrong, were was I to find out?".
<P>
I'm not sure of the balance of abiding by the rules that you never read vs
"how was I supposed to know?".  (Ex: "I never knew murder was illegal" is no
defense anywhere I know.)
<P>
There are cancel-bots used to filter out internet abusers.  I'm concerned
about a denial of service attack.  Let's say somebody forges my header and
spams the network.  The cancelbots then cancel those postings and I'm
essentially barred from the internet.  Unless I get replies that I'm being
blocked, I have no way to know to appeal (let alone to whom) and I must get
a new network identity to ever reachieve connectivity.  My apologies if the
cancelbot control is already centralized and fair, but I fear that I may be
blocked with no way to appeal, even if wrongly accused.  I guess this boils
down to internet connectivity being a privilege, not a right.

I find that a reader's experience with PacBell's third party billed policy not
uncommon. Living in Vancouver, BC, I've had to call BC Tel periodically
(meaning once every year or two depending on my luck) to credit my bill with
third party calls that I did not make.
<P>
It appears that BC Tel rarely verifies third party calls. In other words,
anybody can pick up a pay (or any other) phone, dial the operator and request a
long distance call to be billed to a third phone number that they make up. The
operator may ask for the caller's name but, again, that is not verified so any
name will do.
<P>
I am not certain but I believe the route BC Tel takes is that if they cannot
collect from the caller (i.e. the person who gave a phony name and third party
number), they will try to collect from the number that was called.
<P>
The first risk is the overall reactive approach to chase down fraud after it
has occurred with no attempt to prevent it. In other words, the onus is on the
customer to check if his/her telco has made a billing mistake. In a large
family with several teenagers, this type of bill checking for erroneous third
party calls is quite impossible.
<P>
The second risk is attempting to collect from the called party. What if the
long distance call is a nuisance call from an ex-spouse? Or a $200 long
distance call from old school mates or friends or whoever (and you thought they
were so nice to call you!)... The list goes on. And what about the legal
implications of asking people to pay for calls that they did not initiate nor
authorize?
<P>
But...there is no outcry so I guess the problem is not serious enough to
warrant drastic action.

In <A HREF="/Risks/16.79.html">RISKS-16.79</A>, Jeremy Epstein describes a proposed Virginia law requiring
that companies notify customers if the software they sell has a
self-disabling feature (e.g., after some period of time).  The law would
apparently not ban such features.
<P>
Mr. Epstein then lists two potential risks:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	a)  Does informing people that the software is self-disabling
		encourage them to try to subvert the feature?
</BLOCKQUOTE>
I'm actually rather surprised that anyone would consider these to be *risks*.
Is it a bad idea to inform people that they are liable for no more than $50
in charges on their credit cards a bad idea because it encourages them to be
careless with their cards?  Does telling them their cars have dual-redundant
brakes encourage them to experiment with their master cylinders?
<P>
There are certainly good arguments for and against banning self-disabling
software to begin with.  But if it's to be allowed, requiring fair notice to
those who receive the software certainly seems very reasonable.  If this
perhaps makes life a bit tougher for those whose view of doing business is
"Well, if the customer doesn't pay up, I'll *really* screw him," isn't that
just too bad?
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	b)  If someone did and that triggered the disable feature, would
		that come under the law?
</BLOCKQUOTE>
It's beyond me what could be in the law that such tampering could possibly
"come under".  Even if the idea is that people could get themselves into
trouble by such tampering, which they would not have been tempted to try
without the required disclosure - is there really any reason why the law
should try to protect those individuals who are not only dishonest but
incompetent to boot?
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	Mr. Epstein continues:  And what if it were used in safety critical
	systems: "I'm sorry, but the license period on the software in your
	heart monitor has expired.  Please contact the vendor to reenable."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
I am at a loss as to what this has to do with the proposed law, vague as the
description we have of it might be.  Is Mr. Epstein upset because the law
doesn't simply ban self-disabling features?  It also doesn't ban murder, but
so what.  A general ban on self-disabling features might require some tough
arguing, but a ban on such features for safety-critical systems would be much
harder to oppose.  In any case, I would think it's hardly necessary:  The
liability if a deliberate action led to a serious injury or death would be
enormous.  I should think any lawyer would quite properly have no trouble
convincing a jury that the installation of code to disable a heart monitor
constituted depraved indifference to human life, among other nasty things -
with or without notice.

Jeremy Epstein (<A HREF="/Risks/16.79.html">RISKS-16.79</A>) sees a risk in a proposed Virginia law
requiring disclosure of self-disabling features in software for sale.  Such
a law is actually an extremely good idea and a reducer of risks.  Many
reputable companies, e.g. the SAS Institute, use self-disablers as a way of
enforcing their license agreements.  Unhappily a small number of
disreputable companies have used the same technique to sandbag buyers in the
event of a contract dispute.  With regard to Mr. Epstein's example of
medical monitoring software (ahem) expiring, aren't the RISKS substantially
reduced of one knows beforehand that this is going to happen on a given
date?

Micah Altman writes about a "risk" of 3rd party calls in <A HREF="/Risks/16.80.html">RISKS-16.80</A>.
However, this has always been SOP as far as I am aware.  It was an oft used
method of making long distance calls when I was in college.  Generally,
since I was calling from a listed number, the operator would "take my word
for it".  My parents would check the phone bill when it came.  If they
protested a call then the charge would be made to the number I called from.
If you call from a pay phone, the operator will verify before charging the
number you request.
<P>
The only risk is the good ol' risk of not checking you bill when it comes in
the mail.  At least we have that, the eight years I lived in Austria I never
got an itemized bill.  You took the Post/Telephone Company's word for it!!!
Now, there was a risk!

You are correct that it is not new.  But practice a few years ago was NEVER
to accept a third-number charge unless it was verified live by the third
party.  With the new automated servers, that has been abandoned.  The
savings in fewer operators seems to offset the losses.

Re: Notification on Self-Disabling Software (Jeremy Epstein)

This leads naturally to the following item:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  (1998): In a surprise move, federal marshals yesterday seized nearly nine
  million parking meters in New York City, citing violation of the Software
  Disability Act of 1996.  Consumer advocates praised the move, saying ``the
  meters all stopped working when the time ran out."  The Parking Violations 
  Bureau issued protests that ``all motorists in NYC on were issued a notice
  on 1 April 1975, along with the courtesy windshield cleaning."  However,
  these protests were not accepted, because the majority of motorists
  ticketed were not old enough to have had licenses at the time.

<P>
The WSJ has a big article on the prison phone call business on Wednesday,
February 15, 1995. The article discusses how the major long-distance
companies court prisons because prisoners have nothing better to do than
spend heavily on phone calls.
<P>
But supplying phone service to prisons is not a risky job, because convicts
have a habit of phone and credit card fraud. They'll call an outside phone
number at random, con the person who answers into giving out a credit card
number, and then use that number to order goodies for themselves.
<P>
So, many prisons require the phone-service providers to provide anti-fraud
measures, which include tape-recording equipment and voice-print
identification. Some prisoners have their access to phones restricted, and
they try to use someone else's access codes.  The voice print identification
can nab these guys.  The technology is now being deployed.
<P>
All of this avoids the question of just what is prison in a world where the
apartments are smaller and telecommuting is more popular.  If prisoners can
dial out, conduct business, and even access the net, the walls seem filled
with virtual loopholes.

Computer Aids in Predicting Death, by Mike Koller, AP, Philadelphia
<P>
[...] Using a new program, researchers say they are able to predict when a
terminally ill person will die with more accuracy than doctors using their
own judgment.  The study could help doctors determine which treatments
should be given to terminally ill patients and help decide when life-support
efforts should be stopped.  ``The computer remembers thousands and thousands
of cases and keeps the different risk factors in perspective," said Dr.
William A. Knaus of George Washington University.  Knaus led the study,
published in the Jan. 31 issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine.  ``And
when we included the survival estimate from the patient's own physician in
the model, the two together predicted time until death more accurately than
either alone," he said.  The program was developed from June 1989 to June
1991, using information from 4,301 patients.  It was tested from January
1992 to January 1994 on 4,028 patients, Knaus said.
<P>
The program, called SUPPORT (Study to Understand Prognoses and Preferences
for Outcomes and Risks of Treatments), focused on nine diseases and
conditions, such as liver disease, colon or lung cancer, heart or lung
disease and multiple organ failure.  Knaus said he was confident that
Support will prove reliable and eventually be expanded to predict death
rates for other diseases.  Seriously ill patients with a projected life
expectancy of six months were entered in the study when they were
hospitalized.  [...]
<P>
``Most adults say that if they are going to die within a year, they want
realistic estimates of their risks, both in the immediate future and during
the next few months," Knaus said.  ``This predictive tool is important for
its use for counseling very sick patients and their families."
<P>
However, not everyone agrees.  Toby Gordon, vice president for planning and
marketing at Johns Hopkins Hospital and Health Systems in Baltimore, said
the program raises questions.  ``Any information that helps us learn how to
better take care of patients -- in quality of care and quality of life --
makes a contribution," Gordon said.  ``But whether patients and their
families will want to use it is questionable."  He also questioned the
ramifications of being able to accurately predict death.  ``In the expansion
of computer-assisted technology we will see a proliferation of these
techniques, bringing into question ethics and rationing of care," he said.
<P>
The authors warned that the project has not been tested outside the strictly
controlled settings of teaching hospitals.  Its reliability in conventional
hospitals settings has not been established, they said.

KCBS Radio (San Francisco) reported tonight that The Well and Netcom
combined efforts, resulting in the arrest of 31-year-old hacker Kevin
Mitnick in Raleigh North Carolina.  Both companies discovered large caches
of data being stored on their systems.  At the same time, "a well-known San
Diego consultant" discovered security breaches in his system.  This led to
vigorous efforts to track the hacker, and after 24-hour electronic
surveillance and at least one cellular phone trace, law enforcement
officials arrested Mitnick.  Mitnick's early escapades are chronicled in the
book _CYBERPUNK_ by Katie Hafner and NY Times reporter John Markoff, and, in
fact, Mitnick is accused of breaking into Markoff's computer.  
<P>
Mitnick, a fugitive from justice, faces up to 30 years in prison for various
crimes, including allegedly breaking into NORAD computers.  Law enforcement
officials are now wrestling with jurisdictional issues, as Mitnick is wanted
for crimes in at least six different jurisdictions.

<I>Thu, 12 Jan 1995 15:09:02 EST [TIMELY!  Yes, we are backlogged!]</I>
<P>

Hello, my name's Rob, and I'm a ... a ... Netaholic.
<P>
They tell me a lot of you have a story like mine.  It started out with a
committee and someone at the local university offered me an account, just to
keep in touch, you know?  Then, somebody introduced me to "Computers and
Society".  I could handle that: it only came every week or so.  Then I got
into RISKS-FORUM and the IBM-PC Digest.  That pretty much guaranteed
something every day!  I was really smokin', man!  I thought I was just King
Modem!
 <P>
In order to feed my habit, I started pushing.  I was porting Info-Mac to
local bulletin boards for access.time.  I started doing unmoderated lists.
Then a friend turned me on to Usenet.  By this time, I was doing about a
half a meg a day.
 <P>
I was hooked, but I wouldn't admit it.  I told myself it was all
job-related.  I only read VIRUS-L in order to flog my book.  But why did I
have alt.best-of- usenet in my .newsrc?  My wife took to asking, "Is that in
real time or computer time," when I said I'd be offline in ten minutes.
 <P>
I didn't recognize the danger signs.  I could tell people the first
alt.adjective.noun.verb.verb.verb group.  My wife left me when I started
introducing myself at parties as, "Hi!  <A HREF="mailto:roberts@decus.ca">roberts@decus.ca</A>.  What's your
group?"  I started talking familiarly about people that my friends in
Vancouver had never met.  I started hoarding accounts.  When I found out I
could never match Bill Murray's two full columns on a business card, it was
a real bad trip.  I crashed for a week.
 <P>
Then, it all fell apart.  My access provider started to go flaky.  I tried
Fidonet, but it just wasn't the same.  I ... I ... started reviewing
Internet books.  It wasn't a pretty sight.  Soon, I had two bookshelves
completely full.  *And* that little pile behind the door where I thought no
one could see ...
 <P>
I finally realized I needed help.  As part of the twelve-step process, I'm
telling my story in public.  And I'm going to bust up my modem ... as soon
as I do this one more posting ...
 <P>
     ___
 <P>
Yes, I'm sarcastic.  It's an addiction, OK?
 <P>
Yes, I believe we can all admit that computers can be very addictive.
Programming, itself, is as "moreish" as salted peanuts--and often has a
similar effect on the waistline.  Computers are relatively inexpensive, give
results with minimal training, are completely under the control of the user
(why else call them "personal" computers?) and don't require any particular
considerations.  But do they *cause* addiction?
 <P>
Our society seems to be not merely predisposed to, but actually encouraging
of, obsessive behaviour.  The evidence is not limited to lone psychopaths,
the drug culture, cults and tragedies such as anorexia nervosa.  Amateur
"athletes" who constantly require medical intervention are considered
normal.  We don't *really* believe that a workaholic is a problem.  We
expect scientists to have no idea of culture and artists to have no idea of
technology.
 <P>
Another newswire report of computer addiction, therefore, adds no new
information to the study.  We all know computers can be attractive--but we
all know that there is a difference between the fellow (usually male, isn't
it?)  who runs up enormous bills on the Compuserve CB simulator, and those
of us whose work or study requires as much online correspondence as we can
afford to give.  In many cases, the computer is not a cause but merely a
means.  If it were not the computer, it would be something else.  Recently a
co-worker happened to drop the comment that he didn't watch much TV--only
about five hours a day.  If that is OK (or even "not much"!) can I spend
five hours a day with the modem?  (Can I add an hour for social utility?  As
long as I promise not to use Mosaic?)
 <P>
I am *not* saying that computer addiction cannot be a problem.  If it is,
however, let us give some thought to isolate and identify the difference.

An AP item on 17 Feb 1995 reported that many businesses in Washington state
and Alabama are having trouble receiving phone calls since new area codes
were introduced last month.  The new area codes, 360 in western Washington
and 334 in Alabama, are the first in the country not to use a one or zero as
the middle digit.  The item reports that PBXs reject area codes that include
anything but a 0 or a 1 in the middle position.  The problem will worsen
when additional area codes are installed in, among other regions, Los
Angeles, Denver, and Tampa.

Most mail programs that I have dealt with share a flaw... they don't 
indicate to whom a message will be actually sent.
<P>
This became particularly evident this Valentine's Day when I received a very
warm personal note thanking me for some beautiful flowers and indicating how
I always knew how to make this women happy. This came as quite a surprise to
my wife (and myself)!
<P>
... Many a sitcom episode has started with a weaker premise than this.
Luckily, my wife would never have fit in with the Three's Company crowd
and all is well.
<P>
Still, this probably happened because of quite a simple error. This women
either typed in an alias/nickname that didn't work or just typed the first
name of her suitor instead of his account name. In either case, the mail
program should have indicated to whom the message would be sent. For local
addresses (as this was), the actual name of the recipient (as opposed to the
account name) should be indicated.

	If a third party triggers the disable feature, or, even under the
right circumstances, the owner of the software (ie: the client has paid, but
you disable it anyway) that is a felony in most states, theft by control; ie
: embezzling.  If you hold the software to ransom through such an act, it's
also a felony.

Cancelbots are not normally being used to cancel spams. The articles are
typically selectively cancelled, often one copy will be left in a newsgroup
in which it is "on-topic". Non-spam posts by the same sender are not
affected.

However, there is now a Call for Discussion (CFD) about reorganization of
the news hierarchy. This could, among other things, create a moderated
newsgroup, news.admin.net-abuse.announce, for the posting of announcements,

announcements a stamp of authority that would lead to attacks on the
apparent abusers.

                     NCSA HTTP Daemon for UNIX Vulnerability
<P>

The CERT Coordination Center has received reports that there is a
vulnerability in the NCSA HTTP Daemon V.1.3 for UNIX. Because of this
vulnerability, the daemon can be tricked into executing shell commands.
<P>
If you have any questions regarding this vulnerability, please send
e-mail to Beth Frank at the NCSA, <A HREF="mailto:efrank@ncsa.uiuc.edu">efrank@ncsa.uiuc.edu</A>.
<DL>
<DT>I. Description
<DD>
     A vulnerability in the NCSA HTTP Daemon allows it to be tricked into
     executing shell commands.

<DT>II.  Impact
<DD>
     Remote users may gain unauthorized access to the account (uid) under
     which the httpd process is running.

<DT>III. Solution
<DD>
     The following solution was provided by the HTTPD Team at SDG at
     NCSA.
     <DL>
     <DT>Step 1: 
<DD>
       In the file httpd.h, change the string length definitions
       from:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
                /* The default string lengths */<BR>
                #define MAX_STRING_LEN 256<BR>
                #define HUGE_STRING_LEN 8192
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
        to:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
                /* The default string lengths */<BR>
                #define HUGE_STRING_LEN 8192<BR>
                #define MAX_STRING_LEN  HUGE_STRING_LEN
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

     <DT>Step 2:

   <DD>     Install the following patch, which performs the functionality of
        strsubfirst (i.e., copy src followed by dest[start] into dest) without
        the use of a temporary buffer.  
        <P>
   <I>----[Lengthy patch deleted for RISKS.  Contact CERT FOLKS.  PGN]----</I>
    </DL>
</DL>
After you apply this patch, recompile httpd, kill the current running process,
and restart the new httpd.

Denver's new high-tech airport appears finally ready for operation later
this month, after four false delays caused primarily by a malfunctioning
computerized baggage handling system.  The system now seems to be working --
but a $50 million conventional baggage handling has been built as a backup,
just in case the computerized systems should fail again.  (_The New York

CommunicationsWeek International reports that computer crackers have been
giving European network managers a hard time recently.  Among their
transgressions are stealing $150,000 worth of international phone calls
from five U.K. companies and causing $400,000 in losses for a Dell Computer
subsidiary that had to shut down a free customer service phone line because
of fraud.  (_Information Week_ 20 Feb 1995, p.63)  [From Edupage 19 Feb 1995]

An annoying, and possibly serious, bug has surfaced in the recent 
release of Novell Perfect Office for Microsoft Windows.  Temporary
files may be left behind in the directory designated as TEMP in the
user's autoexec.bat file.  This is usually C:\TEMP or C:\WINDOWS\TEMP.
Left unchecked, the files could eventually accumulate to the point
where they clog the directory so that Windows applications will not run.
The files take the form ~WT123B.TMP (where 123B is a unique identifier
generated by the system) and are 5888 bytes long.
<P>
Although Novell/WordPerfect installation help is "aware" of the bug
and is "working on it," I was told that at present no user-notification
program is being planned.
<P>
You might think they'd learn from Intel's recent public relations fiasco....

In <A HREF="/Risks/16.82.html">RISKS-16.82</A>, Rob Slade perceptively points out that behavior
some have called `computer addiction' is part of wider patterns,
and notes by his analogy that there aren't simple criteria.
<P>
It may be helpful to distinguish rather than to conflate: firstly, between
compulsive behavior and obsession. I would describe compulsive behavior as
following an urge to do something, often repetitively, without concomitant
reward other than that of appeasing the urge.  We won't count the usual
bodily functions...... but if you find yourself washing your hands a few
hundred times a day, or the citizens of Koenigsberg set their watches by
your daily walk to work, you're probably being compulsive. Obsession is when
your thoughts, feelings, maybe actions orient narrowly towards one thing for
a disproportionate time, whether it's rewarding or not.  Sitting there with
the same thought about Demi Moore buzzing round your head, you are obsessed,
but not compelled (we hope).  If getting rid of mother-in-law is your
all-consuming hobby, you may try arsenic in the cake, running her over with
the lawnmower, spiking her brandy, and rigging the breech of her shotgun.
Your wife might leave you for failing at your single purpose in life, but
no one would convict you of compulsive behavior.
<P>
These descriptions are dependent on social variables. Nevertheless,
excessive obsessive/compulsivity is regarded as one of the 15-20 diagnosable
personality extremes in the DSM (the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual,
Revision IV, of the American Psychiatric Association, is a helpful guide to
the current US classification of human behaviors that may lead to social
problems for individuals).  Most successful academics, writers, musicians,
cooks, winemakers, mathematicians, scientists and sportspeople are more
obsessive than the general population. The way to be better than others is
to do something with more enthusiasm and for longer - and it helps if this
concentration jives with your personality.
<P>
Addiction is a state of the organism, rather than predominantly a
predisposition to certain behavior. A substance addict has highly
goal-related behavior. Being drunk or high for these people is a relatively
comfortable state of mind and body for *very* short periods of time. But it
ruins their health, and causes self and others all sorts of problems.
Addiction may be encouraged or even caused by compulsive behavior, but it is
not itself a personality trait, according to the APA.  If deleting email
sends a thrilling tingle through your fingers, and tickles your corpus
callosum until you can't let go, you may be addicted.
<P>
But the boundaries are blurred.  Whether you call heavy use of computers
addictive, obsessive/compulsive, or simply morally virtuous may depend on
the context, the evident goals of the behavior, and whether you're spouse or
employer. So I won't be too surprised when some misguided soul tries to
enroll all us academics, writers, musicians, cooks, winemakers,
mathematicians, scientists and sportspeople in a twelve-step program.

It has happened to me several times now that I inadvertently knock the
keyboard cable of the Sun SPARCstation 10 I work on these days. Most of the
times, the result is a complete and instantaneous crash of the machine. So I
tried and it seems that unplugging and plugging back in the keyboard cable
at the base of the keyboard always crashes and reboots the host. This can
obviously cause disks and user data to be lost. Other times only the X
Window System dies.
<P>
Maybe it is just this particular machine, but otherwise I can't
think what is so critical about a keyboard's hardware that
could cause the machine crash. No doubt a RISK in my book.

A few months ago I moved into a new apartment.  I have since received a lot
of junk mail for Mary Thompson, the former resident, whom I have never met.
(Name changed to protect the innocent.)  From conversations I have had with
neighbors, I know that she lived alone.  About a month ago, I started to
receive credit card ads addressed to "Scott Thompson".  I wrote this off
as just a database entry error (e.g., only overwriting part of the new
resident's name), until this past week.  A few days ago I received two
identical ads, with one addressed to "Scott Thompson" and the other
addressed to "Mrs. Mary Thompson".
<P>
Yikes!  Married to someone I've never met!
<P>
If only our names were confused (e.g., "Scott Thompson"), it would not be
much of a risk.  However, now that at least one database considers us
husband and wife, what kinds of problems does this open?
<UL>
   <LI>Do I get a free ride on *her* credit card history, or does she get
    a free ride on *mine*?  (Stated the opposite way, do I suffer for *her*
    credit card history, or does she suffer for *mine*?)

  <LI> If I fill out the credit card applications listing my real name, but
    they issue the cards to me as "Scott Thompson", am I liable for fraud?

  <LI> If I never reply to any of these ads, could this "false name" come back
    to hurt me?  (In other words, do I have to *proactively* stop this name
    from circulating, or could it never cause me harm so long as I do not
    use it?)

I use a UPS on my PC at home.  The power switch is on the front.  UPS
sits on the floor (the way it has to for the AC outlets to face the right 
way).  The other day I bumped the front of the UPS with my foot and hit 
the power switch, power went off, and I lost my work.  Now that really 
pissed me off... they SAID it was UNINTERRUPTABLE, but one little nudge 
of the power switch and off it went!  Wouldn't honor the warranty, either.
<P>
Ok...Ok... so I'm a moron.  Moral to the story:  If you are considering a 
UPS for a workstation-sized computer, be sure to get one with appropriate 
protection (like a hinged door) covering the power switch.

I'm playing in a computer-moderated play-by-mail game with a not-to-be-named
company out of Oregon, and I ran into an interesting software logic gap.
In the game, players have locations with soldiers defending it.  Locations
can contain guilds (representing an organization supporting a certain
skill or collection of skills).  A location's owner may be different from
the owners of the guilds within it.  In addition to the location's soldiers,
guilds' soldiers can be ordered to defend the location against attack if both
the location's and guilds' owner agree.
<P>
An amusing incident just occurred, when we captured a location from an enemy
position.  Capturing it required us destroying all of the location's soldiers.
However, one of the location's guild owners tried to take the location back
from us by putting soldiers in his guild and then trying to launch a "guild
coup".
<P>
Unfortunately, the guild which attacked the city was also ordered to defend
the city against attack.  The location's previous owner had set this up with
the guild's owner, and the change in ownership from our conquering the location
didn't affect the guild defense options.  So the guild ended up fighting
itself.  Needless to say, it lost.
<P>
And in another amusing result, it turned out that the defender's ending values
from a battle are written to the database before the attacker's.  So since
the attacker had no troops left, the guild ended up with no troops left -
even though the guild-as-defender had troops survive the battle.
<P>
This kind of problem crops up all of the time in software dvelopment.  At
my previous company, I had a problem attempting to deal with real-time data
when an application which was both a data consumer and a data producer
attempted to request data from itself.  The normal protocol would have been
to send the request out to the network, have the network manager route the
request back to the application, and have the application handle it in course.
But the network manager was "smart" and told the consumer "you're requesting
from yourself", and refused the request.  This protocol forced anyone writing
a producing/consuming application to create its own internal method for
requesting data from itself, in addition to the normal method of requesting
data from the network.
<P>
Both cases come down to developers who pictured a very general model,
without considering some of the specific exceptions to the model which may
very well occur in day-to-day use.  In the game company's defense, this flaw
has existed for several years, and as far as they know this is the first
time players have actually encountered it.

<P>
I hope I'm not the only one who will speak out against this "blame the
victim" mentality.  Granted, the crime could and should have been prevented,
but since it did happen, the blame for the crime falls squarely on the
shoulders of the reprobates who committed it.
<P>
The risk I see here is that if we continue to cut criminals some slack by
placing some of the blame on the victim, we're only going to invite more
crime of this sort.  To me, this is only slightly more palatable than
blaming a rape victim because of how she was dressed.

&gt; Fears of this development have led to the organization of the NetNews<BR>
&gt; Judges (TM) List (this is a reformatted InterNIC resource entry):
<P>
Note that the people who actually do the volunteer work that keep Usenet
running, as well as most long time Usenet readers that know about it,
consider Judges-L to be a crank list. It's a closed list, with rules
about the dissemination of messages outside the official membership. It
periodically produces informational postings that have no relationship
to accepted net behaviour.
<P>
Like any other "authority" on Usenet it has no power but what individuals
grant it. Unlike "authorities" like David Lawrence, who is accepted by the
majority of sites as being the authoritative source of new groups, Judges-L
has no followers except for the people who are actually on the list... and
even then some of the people on Judges-L are only there to keep an eye on
them.

%T   "PGP: Pretty Good Privacy"
<P>
Part one of this guide to Phil Zimmermann's "Pretty Good Privacy" (universally
known by its initials, PGP) contains two rather disjointed chapters introducing
PGP, itself, and cryptography basics.  After that rocky start, however, part
two is both readable and rivetting.  Chapters on the history of cryptography,
the history and development of PGP, privacy, and patents gather both the
technical and social aspects of PGP together in one place.  The conceptual
background for public key cryptography is presented both soundly and in a
manner accessible for non-experts.  The many controversies over PGP are
presented in a very detailed manner.
<P> 
Part three, "Using PGP", has chapters on file encryption, key creation, key
management, email encryption, digital signatures (authentication), key
distribution and certification, and Internet key servers.  The style of the
nutshell books give a very "technical" look to the material, and in some cases
the content is very terse in comparison to Stallings' "Protecting Your Privacy"
(cf. BKPRTPRV.RVW).  In others (such as key management), though, the text here
is paradoxically clearer.  In any case, the examples are straightforward and
easily followed.  (Readers may, however, be excused for failing to follow the
explanation of Diffie-Hellman on page 356.)
 <P>
The appendices cover obtaining and installing PGP for MS-DOS, UNIX and
Macintosh.

While RISKS is ostensibly devoted to the foibles of computer generated bugs,
readers of the list will probably enjoy _The Coming Plague_ by Laurie
Garrett (Farrar Straus &amp; Giroux). The book explores many of the battlefields
between humans and microbes and then concludes that it is only a matter of
time before the microbes score some dramatic victories. Many of the themes
are familar to RISKS readers: the fix causes more pain than it solves; the
bountiful commonweal often comes with a quicksilver lining; and there is no
such thing as the last bug.
<P>
The bestselling _Hot Zone_ covers a small part of the scope of this book
and it is more a movie outline than a book on science. _The Coming Plague_
comes with copious footnotes and is filled with the technical details that
scientists love. I've enjoyed it more and I suspect that others who read
this list might feel the same.  Given that some computer scientists talk of
solving NP complete problems with DNA techniques, I guess that the fields
are effectively merged and this is entirely appropriate for this list.

A symposium is coming up that has tremendous consequences for the privacy of
sensitive personal medical records -- Toward an Electronic Patient Record
'95, 14-19 March 1995 in Orlando, Florida.  The basic idea is to put all of
your medical records on-line in a centralized repository, accessible to any
medical professional who needs them.  This is great when the folks in the
emergency room need your records in a hurry, but it's not so great when your
records are also available to insurance companies and marketers, not to
mention private investigators who are willing to push the law a little bit.
Right now the outlook for serious privacy protections on computerized
medical records is not so good.  As a result, I think it would be excellent
if any net citizens were to attend this symposium and report back to the net
community.
<P>
I would particularly direct your attention to a meeting of the Standards
Subcommittee on Access, Privacy and Confidentiality of Medical Records,
which is to be held on Sunday March 12th and will be open to the public.
It isn't good enough for privacy to be protected by vague principles and
guidelines after the systems have been designed.  Privacy capabilities such
as patients' control over their personal information must be built into the
technical standards, and if you can be in Florida in March then you can help
out by informing the net community about the progress of those standards.
<P>
More generally, the standards for a whole generation of privacy-sensitive
systems are being set right now -- Intelligent Transportation Systems are
another example -- and I think it's important for the net community to 
track the standard-setting process, publicizing problems and intervening 
to make sure that the new generation of standards makes full use of the 
new generation of privacy technologies -- especially technologies such as
digital cash that are based on public-key cryptography.  In the case of
medical records, some of the people designing the systems actually are aware
of the existence of these new privacy technologies.  The hard part is making
sure that real privacy protection is actually built into the standards
despite the probable pressure of various economic interests to the contrary.
<P>
The symposium is organized by the Medical Records Institute.  MRI is on 
the Web at <A HREF="http://www.nfic.com/mri/mri.html">http://www.nfic.com/mri/mri.html</A>   But I particularly recommend 
the 36-page paper version of the conference announcement since it includes
information about the exhibitors -- valuable raw material for research by
privacy advocates.  MRI's e-mail address is <A HREF="mailto:71431.2030@compuserve.com">71431.2030@compuserve.com</A> and

Many vendors' man pages, books, and magazine articles dealing with setting
up an anonymous FTP server recommend something that is a possible security
vulnerability.  The security flaw is a result of old manual pages and new
features being added to ftpd.  They recommend the following:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DL>
    <DT> ~ftp)
<DD>          Make the home directory owned by ``ftp'' and unwritable
          by anyone.
</DL></BLOCKQUOTE>
A new feature added to many ftpd servers is "SITE CHMOD" -- which allows you
to change the permissions on a directory.  If the main directory is owned by
ftp, then an anonymous ftp user can SITE CHMOD the main directory from
unwriteable to writeable.  Once this has happened, they can add certian
files to the main directory that would allow them shell access to the ftp
account, thus to further compromise the system.
<P>
Many sites keep their incoming directory un-readable so that the
administrator has a chance to verify files before allowing others to grab
them.  An intruder could undo all these permissions and even trojan existing
ftp files.
<P>
To fix these problems, make sure the home directory is owned by root and
that all files and directories are not owned by ftp.  Unless you want
anonymous ftp to be able to modify what is on your ftp server.
<P>
For other security concerns, I have written a Anonymous Security FTP FAQ
(Frequently Asked Questions) that is available by sending mail to

More than 200 software developers may have had their computers infected by a
virus after Microsoft, the world's leading software developer, gave them
infected disks at a seminar in London.  Microsoft said yesterday the company
that copied the disks for it had also been responsible for carrying out
virus checks, and had been sacked because it had ``cut corners.''  A
spokeswoman said a developer spotted the virus after the seminar.  ``We
immediately telephoned all the developers who attended and warned them,''
she said.  Microsoft had also written to them all and apologised.  It is
believed only a few disks contained the virus.

               National Policy and Cryptography:<BR>
              A Call for Input and Public Meeting<P>

  Over the past few years, few topics have provoked as much debate
  as the appropriate role of government as it relates to cryptography.
  What is clear is that cryptography is critical to a wide range of
  important civilian and military applications involving sensitive or
  classified information that must be protected from unauthorized
  disclosure and/or alteration.  National cryptography policy --
  however it is construed -- has important implications for future U.S.
  economic competitiveness, national security, law enforcement
  interests, and the protection of the rights of individual U.S. citizens.
  In an attempt to clarify some of the issues involved, the U.S.
  Congress asked the National Research Council to undertake a
  comprehensive study on cryptographic technologies and national
  cryptography policy.  This study began in late 1994.
<P>
  The study seeks broad input from stakeholders affected by national
  cryptography policy.  Thus, the study committee invites interested
  parties to answer the following question:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
        How, if at all, will new telecommunications
        technology, such as encryption, make it easier to
        protect and/or compromise the interests of the
        relevant constituencies?  Some of the constituencies
        might include individual citizens, organizations in
        national security and law enforcement, high
        technology businesses, business in general, and
        non-profit and/or public service enterprises such as
        health care and education.
<P>
        Please use as the standard of comparison the ease
        today of compromising or protecting these interests.
        We are interested in scenarios involving both
        individual users and large-scale impact.  Please be
        sure to tell us the interests you believe are at stake.
        (If your input involves classified or sensitive
        information, contact us to make appropriate
        arrangements.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
  All responses received by e-mail or U.S. mail prior to June 30,
  1995 will be reviewed by the study committee.  In addition, the
  committee will sponsor a public session to receive oral input on
  Friday, April 14, 1995, 8:30 AM to 12:30 PM, at the Lecture Room
  of the National Academy of Sciences, 2101 Constitution Avenue
  NW, Washington, DC  20418.  (No public parking is available.)  In
  the interests of hearing the maximum number of people, speakers
  will be limited to a statement of 6 minutes each.  Anyone who
  wishes to give oral testimony should submit their request
  along with their response to the above question.  (If you plan
  only to attend, please inform us as well.)  Ground rules for oral
  presentation and/or a more detailed description of the study and its
  charge is available upon request to <A HREF="mailto:CRYPTO@NAS.EDU">CRYPTO@NAS.EDU</A>.
<P>
  This is your opportunity to make your voice heard on this important
  subject.   One way or another, cryptography policy does affect you.
  This study is expected to help shape Congressional and
  Administration views on national cryptography policy, and the
  operative question to you is the following: Should this study take
  your views into account?  We hope you answer that question in the
  affirmative.

The Washington Post news wire BYTES column for 95.02.13 
(via CompuServe's Executive News Service) reports that the Washington, DC
Internet provider, CapAccess, has been compromised by criminal hackers.
<P>
The 12,000 users are at risk of impersonation because someone installed
"software that stole users' IDs and passwords."
<P>
The attack was apparently discovered only when CapAccess officials were 
informed by anonymous e-mail apologizing for the trick.

I would like to describe a strange case of file corruption on one of the
largest on-line service providers that cost me a day's work and a lot of
experimentation to chase down.
<P>
Several months ago I used a reliable program with error detection and 
"auto downloaded" several megabytes of programs and text  files. 
<P>
Most of the files were compressed with PKZIP.  After getting a
warning from PKUNZIP about a file being corrupt, I checked all the rest,
about 15, using PKUNZIP -t.  All the files but one were corrupt.
<P>
I've downloaded many megabytes and thousands of dollars of files from the
service, without this problem.  Thinking it was my ..serial port..hard drive
..download protocol..modem..virus.. or the particular directory (security
associated) that had a lot of corrupt files, I changed all the software
and hardware a piece at a time.  Hours of downloads later, there was only
one constant, and it was the on-line service.
 <P>
I determined it wasn't the files as stored on their hard drive, since I
could eventually get a good copy of most files.  On the corrupt ones,
checksums matched over 2,3 or 4 copies downloaded with different computers
and error-detection schemes, including Ymodem, xmodem, and Kermit.  This 
service has a checksum command to match an already downloaded file and 
prevent duplicate downloads, and it matched the files (corrupt) still there 
with the files (corrupt) already on my hard drive.
<P>
I called support, and they admitted they were having a very odd problem with
one of their machines, probably the one with my corrupted files on it.
<P>
Two days later, no file corruption.  Two weeks later, another batch of the same 
type of corruption problem.  None since then.
<P>
With some types of files this kind of corruption would not have been
obvious for what it was - the 32 bit PKZIP checksum saved the day, and
made it easier to determine the real culprit.
<P>
What type of problem, other than malicious programming, could cause these
symptoms?

For the last few months, I have experienced intermittent problems with the
infrared remote controls for my TV, VCR, and stereo.  The symptoms were
difficulty activating the remote buttons, search operations continuing after
they should have stopped, and, very occasionally, spontaneous channel changes.
More recently, a friend's TV totally locked up as if one of the buttons was
stuck in the activated position.
<P>
New batteries had no effect.  Disassembly of remotes found nothing. I even
disassembled the friend's TV found nothing until I noticed it would work fine
on the test bench but not in its normal installed location.  This lead me to
correlate the problem with the recent installation of energy saving compact
fluorescent light bulbs.  Further testing proved conclusively that all of my
infrared remote receivers were adversely affected by these lights.
<P>
The lights in question were manufactured by Lights of America (Models 2004 and
2030TP) but I expect other manufacturers may have the same problem.  The bulbs
advertise a tri-phosphor that produces a soft white light quality.  They also
have instant on, flicker free characteristics produced by a solid state
circuit that replaces the standard fluorescent ballast.
<P>
Based on my observations I can only conclude that the tri-phosphor bulbs emit
light in the infrared portion of the spectrum and that the electronics modulate
the light at frequencies used by infrared remote control devices.
<P>
The manufacturer does include disclaimers about the devices causing
"interference if placed within 10 feet of sensitive equipment.  (T.V.s,
radios, etc.)."   (I experienced IR interference problems at 15+ feet.) There
is also a statement about compliance with part 18 of the FCC Rules indicating
that the device may not cause harmful interference.  I assumed these
references are directed at RF interference as that is what one normally
expects and there is no mention of infrared emissions.
<P>
The real risk deals with possible consequences of these lights causing
interference with existing and evolving applications of infrared technology
such as wireless digital communications, automotive collision avoidance
systems, etc.

<I>Sat, 11 Feb 1995 13:19:59 +0100</I><P>

In December 1994, European Commission's office for "dissemination of
scientific and technical knowledge" distributed a diskette to more than
1,000 European information brokers, patent offices etc containing a CORDIS
News (in German) describing its RTD database etc. This diskette contained a
system (boot sector/MBR) infector which besides displaying a message (on
May 22nd, after noon: ";Galicia contra telefonica!") also overwrites
(unrecoverably) part of a diskette's boot library, and which attempts to
format a disk's cylinder. Though this formatting will likely abort, due to a
programming error, it is possible that formatting may succeed. Indeed, this
virus is malicious and not funny.  (For details, see appended VTC Malware
Catalog entry).
<P>
It is even less funny that this EU office when informed about its malicious
gift to its customers found it very hard to locate the source of the
contamination; they even could not say whether it came from another EU
office or from one of their PCs. Only after some time, they claimed to have
found 2 potential leaks which their expert said they now have closed. This
implies that for some time, EU's information dissemination was a permanent
danger for its customers.
<P>
Even more ironically: this EU office belongs to EU's Directorate General (DG
XIII) "Telecommunications, Information Market and Exploitation of Research",
which (with its branch "B.6 Security of Telecommunications and Information
Systems") is responsible for EU's IT Security Criteria (ITSEC), which also
participates actual in joint US/EU attempts to develop "Common Criteria".
When being informed about the malicious distribution by its sister office,
the head of DG XIII's SOG-IS (Senior Officials Group - Information Security)
informed the author that they dont share responsibility for maintaining a
proper security as this is done by the European Commission's Office of
Security (a typical bureaucratic approach :-). Moreover, this very nice
expert claims that "I recognize that such incidents will happen from time to
time and that the responsibility ***falls equally on both sender and
receiver*** to ensure that the most 'hygienic' procedures are used to avoid
any unnecessary spread of 'infection'"(quoted from a reply of SOG-IS chair;
emphasis added by author). Finally, "controlling viruses is primarily a
procedural rather than technical problem".
<P>
Both an evidently failing AntiVirus policy (if existing) and such expert 
opinion makes it rather likely that similar incidents will follow. If I were
a virus author (being a civil servant, I have NO CRIMINAL energy as I have NO
ENERGY at all :-), I would dream of such a large organisations (several 10,000
bureaucrats) with such "awareness". With their intellectual innocence, they'd 
surely help to distribute my virii if I only succeeded to infect one PC!

Easy Identification.: ID word: V1.
                      Self recognition in memory: 7C B8 (h)  at [0:004C]
                      Self recognition on disk:   56 31 (h)  at [01B3h]
Type of infection...: System: Upon booting from an infected diskette
                              or disk (MBR), virus makes itself memory
                              resident at top of memory/below 640 kBytes,
                              and it hooks Int 13h.
                      Disk:   After booting from an infected diskette,
                              memory resident virus will infect MBR
                              upon trigger condition; original MBR
                              is saved.
                      Diskette: Once virus became memory resident, it
                              will infect any uninfected diskette in 
                              drive A: and B: upon trigger condition; 
                              original boot sector is saved.
Infection Trigger...: System/Memory: booting from infected disk/diskette
                      Disk/Diskette: any read (Int 13) access, when
                         drive is not actual drive. 
Storage media affected: Diskette,Harddisk
Interrupts hooked...: Int 13h/02 (Read)
Damage..............: Transient: At trigger time, virus displays
                         message: "Galicia contra =&gt;telefonica!".
                         This text string is encrypted in virus body.
                      Permanent/Disk: Upon trigger condition, virus 
                         attempts to format 1st cylinder 
                         (track 0/head 0/sector 6); due to a programming
                         error (un-initialised buffer address), this
                         attempt will very probably abort with an error.
                      Permanent/Diskette: Upon infecting a diskette,
                         virus overwrites track 0/head 1/ector which 
                         contains part of root directory:
                            on  5,25" DD: last sector of root dir;
                            on  5,25" HD: 3rd sector of root dir;
                            on  3,5"  DD: 3rd last sector of root dir;
                            on  3,5"  HD: 2nd sector of root dir.
                         As virus does not store this sector elsewhere, 
                         parts of root directory (e.g. entries 16-32 
                         on 3.5" HD) are lost.
Damage Trigger......: Transient: IF (May 22) AND (time &gt; 12:00) AND
                         (access to drive which is not to actual drive)
                      Permanent/Disk: IF (May 22) AND (time &gt; 12:00) AND
                         (access to drive which is not to actual drive)
                      Permanent/Diskette: upon infection of boot sector
Particularities.....: Findviru calls the virus "Telefonica.d", probably
                         due to the displayed text, though the virus has
                         no relation to the Telefonica family. 
Cryptomethods.......: Partly encrypted (XOR with FFFFH from offset 
                         003Ch to 0159h).
Stealth.............: ---
Polymorphism........: --- 
Tunneling...........: ---
--------------------- Agents -----------------------------------------
Countermeasures.....: Good AntiVirus products (detection/cleaning). 
Countermeasures successful: Several actual AntiVirus products detect 
                         Galicia, essentially under its name; at 
                         publication time, only few AV products (e.g.,
                         Kaspersky's AVP) properly clean it from media.
Standard means......: Cleaning diskettes: format infected diskette
                         (MS-DOS &gt;=5.0, DR DOS &gt;=6.0) with /U.
                      Cleaning hard disk: Use DOS FDISK /MBR command 
                         to overwrite the virus.

Twenty-Ninth Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences<BR>
January 3-6, 1996, Maui, Hawaii
<P>
Dr. Raymond R. Panko, minitrack coordinator
<A HREF="mailto:Panko@dscience.cba.hawaii.edu">Panko@dscience.cba.hawaii.edu</A>
<P>
Papers are invited for the minitrack on RISKS IN END-USER COMPUTING as part
of the Information Systems track at the Hawaii International Conference on
System Science (HICSS).
<P>
Risks in End-User Computing
<P>
End users are ordinary computer users, such as managers and professionals,
rather than computer professionals.  End users control a great deal of all
computing.  There is growing evidence that this dominance of end-user
computing creates risks for organizations and perhaps even society.
<P>
We are soliciting research papers in such areas as 1) lab and field studies
on errors in spreadsheeting, query languages, and schema development in
databases, 2) privacy and security issues related to user access to
information, 3) and risks when end users use the Internet.  This is not
meant to be an exhaustive list.

<H3>HICSS</H3>
HICSS is one of the oldest conferences in information systems and computer
science.  The 1996 conference will be the 29th in an unbroken series.  Each
year, the conference attracts about 500 computer research professionals.
The conference is conducted in cooperation with the IEEE Computer Society
and the ACM.  The Proceedings are published by the IEEE Computer Society
Press.
<P>
Making HICSS unique is its organization around minitracks.  In a minitrack,
the minitrack coordinator receives about fifteen to twenty papers and
selects six for presentation at the conference.  Selection is based on
rigorous refereeing, ensuring high quality.  All papers to be presented at
the conference are published in the Proceedings, which is available at the
start of the conference.
<P>
The minitrack focus of HICSS turns each minitrack into a mini-workshop.  It
provides a critical mass of research papers in a target area, providing the
cross-fertilization of ideas.  In addition, the conference activities are
consciously organized to maximize interactions among the participants.  Of
course, minitrack participants also attend many other sessions in
information systems and computer science.
<P>
Please note that HICSS is a research conference.  It is not a place for
publishing the types of articles that would appear in popular magazines.
HICSS papers should be potentially publishable in research journals.

<H4>Instructions for submitting papers:</H4>
<OL>
<LI>	Submit 6 (six) copies of the full paper, consisting of 20-25 pages
double-spaced including title page, abstract, references and diagrams
directly to the minitrack coordinator.  Longer submissions will be rejected,
as will much shorter submissions.

<LI>	Do not submit the paper to more than one minitrack.  Paper should
contain original material and not be previously published or currently
submitted for consider elsewhere.

<LI>	Each paper must have a title page which includes the title, full
name of all authors, and their complete address including affiliation(s),
telephone number(s), and e-mail address(es).  For purposes of anonymous
refereeing, the author(s) name(s) should not appear in the rest of the
paper.

<LI>	The first page of the paper should include the title and a 300-word
abstract.
</OL>

<H3>DEADLINES:</H3>
MARCH 15, 1995: Abstracts MAY be submitted to minitrack coordinators (or
track coordinators) for guidance and indication of appropriate content.
Authors unfamiliar with HICSS or who with additional guidance are encouraged
to contact any coordinator to discuss potential papers.  Abstracts are NOT
required but are strongly encouraged.
<P>
JUNE  1, 1995: Full papers due [...]<BR>
AUG. 31, 1995:  Notification [...]<BR>

<P>
The Risks in End-User Computing minitrack is part of the Information Systems
Track.  There are two other major tracks in the conference: Software
Technology and Digital Documents.  The Information Systems Track itself has
several minitracks that focus on a variety of research topics in
Collaboration Technology, Decision Support and Knowledge-Based Systems, and
Organizational Systems and Technology. For more information contact:

The Computer Emergency Response Team has issued a public warning on a
vulnerability in some 20 commonly used E-mail programs that run on Unix
operating systems.  The advisory said the latest discovery could allow a
hacker to ``read any file on the system, overwrite or destroy files."  The
ultimate solution to these recurrent security problems, says Purdue
University professor Eugene Spafford, is for consumers to demand better
security features from software manufacturers.  In the absence of improved
software, "are we going to continue seeing problems? You bet."  (Wall Street
Journal 2/23/95 B8)

 <P>
This is the third work that I have seen on the PGP (Pretty Good Privacy)
text encryption and authentication system.  (I understand that at least two
more are in the works.)  It is also the first to truly present the general
concept of email security by covering the only other realistic option--the
Internet Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) standard and (Mark) Riordan's Internet
Privacy Enhanced Mail (RIPEM) implementation.  The book divides roughly into
quarters discussing background, practical use, the PGP documentation, and
the PEM RFCs.
 <P>
The work is considerably different, in style, to the Stallings
(BKPRTPRV.RVW) and Garfinkel (BKPGPGAR.RVW) efforts.  Those books, while not
obtuse, were still written with a technical audience in mind.  Schneier's
work, while definitely showing the expertise he demonstrated in "Applied
Encryptography" (BKAPCRYP.RVW), is clearly aimed at the general,
non-technical reader.  (Interestingly, while he *does* tell you where to
find the RC4 algorithm posting, he *doesn't* mention the loophole recently
pointed out in the Clipper "Skipjack" algorithm.)  The straightforward style
lulled me into thinking that chapter one was too long.  It isn't: Schneier
makes the important point that, for it to be *truly* effective, encryption
must be used on *all* correspondence, even trivial items.  So well crafted
is his argument that it would be difficult to reduce the chapter by so much
as a paragraph.
 <P>
Schneier uses this argument to good effect in pointing out some of the major
deficiencies in the two systems.  PGP is awkward to use, and PEM may use
incompatible algorithms.  Surprisingly, he does not emphasize (though he does
mention) what is probably the major problem with each--the inability to use the
same system within and outside of the United States.  The PGP fiasco is too
involved to get into here (see the Garfinkel work for details) and there is not
yet an "international" implementation of PEM (although there may soon be an
"authentication only" version available).
 <P>
This won't help you design your own algorithm, but it is definitely for any
user of email, manager of communications systems, or student of privacy and
confidentiality.

   [And WHAT, might you ask, does this have to do with RISKS?  Well,
   can you think of any bugs in computer systems that have resulted
   from bugs in writing?  We've seen quite a few in RISKS.  And 
   besides, this is a terrific book.  PGN]
</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

*BUGS in Writing*, written with verve and wit, may be the first book on
writing that people read for sheer fun.  Unlike traditional style manuals,
which present huge hierarchical rules bases (and which hardly make for
amusing reading), *BUGS* presents an alternative, intuitive way of looking
at written language that is based on the concept of ear: the ability to
hear, without analysis, whether a given work order, sentence, or term is
correct.  *BUGS* explores problems that writers face, and explains how to
rid your prose of these bugs.
<P>
Designed for easy browsing, *BUGS* comprises 150 independent and easily
digestible segments, resembling a daily newspaper column and presented with
an unusual, appealing, inviting design. Dupre not only tells you about good
writing -- she also demonstrates it for you, conveying simple principles for
lucid writing by numerous, intriguing, and frequently hilarious examples
that are classified with the bugs system: Bad, Ugly, Good, or Splendid.
<P>
*BUGS* was developed for anyone who writes and who works with computers,
including computer and other scientists, students, professors, business
people, programmers, and technical writers.  Rather than subjecting yourself
to the pain and tedium of wading through a reference book on English
grammar, you can pick up *BUGS*; you will immediately find yourself browsing
interesting and amusing material.  While you are enjoying yourself, you will
be tuning your ear.  As a result, you will write lucid prose that
communicates your ideas.

This is a warning about poor distribution of fixes for security holes.
<P>
In several locations on the 'net I have found the warning about the 
security hole in NCSA httpd 1.3.
<P>
The fix they suggested was only to change the default string lengths, but
didn't include the patch to perform the functionality of strsubfirst().
<P>
While this will prevent any current attack programs from gaining access,
only a minor change would be necessary to attack the slightly modified
httpd (I think!).
<P>
This means there are probably a good many httpd daemons out there that are
still vulnerable, yet the administrators think they are now secure.

I read this submission to RISKS with some amusement.  This particular
problem is not new to the WordPerfect portion of Novell's Perfect Office --
in fact WordPerfect is far from being the only culprit in leaving behind
stray ~*.tmp files.  In the course of its operations, Windows and many
Windows applications often write files with a ~*.tmp filename to the \TEMP
directory listed in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file via the SET TEMP= command.
Windows normally removes these files automatically when you exit Windows.
If Windows crashes, or if you turn off your computer before exiting
gracefully from Windows, these files get left behind, and are not erased the
next time you start Windows.  The accumulation of ~*.tmp files not only will
take up hard drive space, but can interfere with the operation of Windows
and Windows applications.  Many a mysterious General Protection Fault I've
run across on other people's computers have been attributed to an
accumulation of ~*.tmp files on their hard drives.
<P>
The best thing to do is to erase these ~*.tmp files from your hard drive as 
often as possible.  Many people throw in a line within their AUTOEXEC.BAT 
files which automatically go to the directory where ~*.tmp files are 
stored, and delete the contents of that directory before launching Windows. 
 This must be done from DOS, rather than from within Windows, as Windows 
does not take kindly to the attempted erasure of ~*.tmp files it is 
currently using.  If you are not sure where your ~*.tmp files are stored, 
type SET from the DOS prompt, and the SET TEMP= will tell you which 
directory to check.  If no SET TEMP= line appears, the ~*.tmp files will 
reside in your \WINDOWS directory.
<P>
My only criticism of WordPerfect (going back to version 5.1 for Windows to 
the current 6.1 release) in this matter is that they consistently leave 
behind more ~*.tmp files than most of the other Windows programs I have 
used.  I still prefer WordPerfect over most other wordprocessors however, 
so I suffer with the problem and just erase the stray ~*.tmp files it 
leaves behind.

Unless Novell is really bad about it, I don't think Perfect Office
is the only guilty party.  We use Microsoft Office here and have the
same problems.  Actually I think that it is a Windows problem.
<P>
One of the things I do when I "tune-up" someone's computer is look for
temp files. I search using File Manager with a Search For: ~*.*.  I
have literally found megs of temp files clogging up hard drives.
<P>
The user is usually to blame.  The temp files should be deleted when the
user closes the application or shuts down Windows *properly*.  If they
just turn off the power switch while Windows is still on the monitor,
temp files won't be deleted.  In other words, tell them not to hit the
power switch until they see C:\. (Another problem with not shutting down
Windows properly is there will be lost clusters all over the place on the
hard drive.  Using CHKDSK /F or SCANDISK, I've recovered up to 50 megs of
hard drive space!).
<P>
If they don't have a SET TEMP=C:\TEMP (or something similar) statement in
their AUTOEXEC.BAT, temp files will just dump all over the place.  Also,
there better be a TEMP (or similar) directory or the same will happen.

&gt; It has happened to me several times now that I inadvertently knock the<BR>
&gt; keyboard cable of the Sun SPARCstation 10 I work on these days. Most of the<BR>
&gt; times, the result is a complete and instantaneous crash of the machine.
<P>
Actually, this is a feature.
<P>
I know, it doesn't sound like a feature. And there are more ways to
come to grief by this feature than just mentioned - most notable being the 
well-intentioned conservationist who powers off an ASCII terminal being used
as a sun server console. The agonized screams from the users down the hall
usually alert the conservationist as to his impending fate. (See also:
	<A HREF="http://pond.cso.uiuc.edu/ducky/docs/jimbo/raptor.html">http://pond.cso.uiuc.edu/ducky/docs/jimbo/raptor.html</A>)
<P>
It doesn't actually cause a crash. Since time immemorial (long before 
I started working with sun serial drivers), a BREAK condition on the 
console line has been an attention signal telling a Sun to jump into 
its prom. Unplugging a serial (async) line generates a BREAK condition.
Usually, you can recover by typing "go" after you plug the cable back in.
<P>
The reason it is a feature; Occasionally a user will do something he regrets 
(certain programs which clobber the keyboard or simply won't exit should 
not be run on the console), and the user needs some way to regain control of
his system. Unlike PCs, UNIX resents being powered off. It wants to be 
politely shut down first. If you forget often enough, UNIX will take it's
revenge on you by eating your file system. Hence this escape into PROM.
<P>
On a normal ascii line, the only safe condition to detect is a "BREAK" -
everything else having been assigned functions by Gnu EMACS. On a keyboard,
where we aren't limited by ASCII, the "STOP-A" combination is normally used.
But "BREAK" serves the same purpose, and will sometimes work when STOP-A
won't (send me email if you want the grody details). Once you have gotten
back into the prom, you can "sync" the filesystems and reboot. 
<P>
If you _really_ want to disable this functionality, you could find the
call to abort_sequence_enter() at the end of zsa_xsint in zs_async.c, and 
NoOp it out. This keeps STOP-A/L1-A functionality (called from kbd.c) while
disabling the "BREAK" functionality. It helps to be handy with kadb.
<P>
But caveat emptor - Murphy's law guarantees that as soon as you disable
this functionality, within the next week you will desperately need it.

Charles M. Preston's story of corrupted files (in <A HREF="/Risks/16.84.html">RISKS-16.84</A>) sounds like a
situation I once saw that was traced to a flaky disk controller.  Sometimes
one or more bits would be cleared somewhere in the file.  Since it was the
"0x20" bit, we first noticed it when random scattered letters were
capitalized in text files.  Sometime later, presumably after buffers had
been flushed, the affected files would be back to normal.
<P>
The service tech didn't quite believe us, but he replaced the disk controller
board, and the problem went away.

from a DOS shell while Windows is running.  This problem goes away if I
close Windows first.  (No this isn't a fix or an explanation, but my
temporary work-around).

Charles Preston asks "what type of problem, other than malicious
programming, could cause these symptoms?", in regards to an on-line service
occasionally serving up damaged files.
<P>
The possible reasons for such behaviour are numerous, and it aids no-one to
call up the specter of a rouge programmer or "hacker", if such a thing is
not known to be true. This is a risk that is now being run by everyone
providing an electronic service: an accusal of being "hacked", or of
"downloading the users hard disk in secret", or of "damaging files for
unknown purposes", (just to name a few,) carries a large weight in the
press, and is potentially difficult to fight.
<P>
I believe Charles is talking about the CompuServe Information Service, which
I have heard some small comments about infrequent damage to downloaded
files. The behaviour is supposed to be quite uncommon, and goes away on a
repeat of the transfer. Of course, Charles could be talking about any large
service that provides files for download.  Anything from a damaged disk
drive to a fluky controller card to a out-of-tolerance CPU to a buggy
program could cause these problems, and I know of no company that is immune
to such things.
<P>
Lastly, yes, since the file-transfer checksums matched, having a secondary
checksum (in this case, actually a CRC provided by PKZIP) would certainly
prove useful. That's why PKZIP does it, and why CRCs are in common use.
This also points out the risk of not verifying data integrity on all levels.
Presumably a CRC check used at some stage in the service's computer would
have detected the problem earlier.

Looks like Peter da Silva was confused by the "Cancel Messages: 
Frequently Asked Questions Part 2" post, a forgery meant as a joke. 
The List has released a single informational post, a single time. It
was developed with contributions from leading Usenet administrators,
some of whom have chosen to remain anonymous. When the latest version
was approved, via a consensus decision making process, there were
about a dozen leading administrators subscribed, and under the rules,
anyone of them could have blocked its release, or tried to, thus 
precipitating a vote. This did not occur. It was a consensus document. 
(The forgery was, unfortunately, taken seriously by all too many, 
including the Italian EFF. This perhaps is an indication of the need 
for informational posts on this topic.) The authentic document starts 
with a summary:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    Cancel Messages:  Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ). Ver. 2.0
    Summary:
<P>
    You can protect your reputation as a information source by cancelling
    articles posted under your name as soon as you discover that they are
    erroneous.
<P>
    Cancelling other's articles, however, can expose you, your site, and the
    Net as a whole, to serious threats.  The sender should be notified when
    articles need to be cancelled.
<P>
    Disputes or doubtful cases can be directed to the Judges' List for
    resolution.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The List is open to anyone who agrees to follow the rules adopted through
the List's consensus decision making process. The List is not confidential,
that is, it can be located by a LISTSERV search.  It is also open to review
by the public. A review command to <A HREF="mailto:LISTSERV@UBVM.cc.buffalo.edu">LISTSERV@UBVM.cc.buffalo.edu</A> will yield
the settings and membership of the List. This will show, among other things,
that anyone may send mail directly to the List: There is no editor who must
approve messages. Since the List now offers confidential dispute resolution,
the continued dissemination of messages via mail-to-news gateways, etc.  was
deemed inappropriate. This question, however, continues to be debated.
<P>
Information about the NetNews Judges (TM) List appeared in the _New
Scientist_ magazine at the end of last year. It is also discussed
in the most recent issue of _Matrix News_. I was also interviewed 
recently by a reporter from _The Chronicle of Higher Education_ about 
the List.

Flaws were reported in the PC and Mac versions of TurboTax and MacInTax
1040.  These flaws are triggered when transferring tax data to the tax
package from other software, such as Quicken.  Intuit estimates that the
flaws would affect only about 1% of the users.  Intuit Chairman Scott Cook
apologized that the flaws had been known for a few weeks and had not been
publically acknowledged until 1 Mar 1995.  He also indicated that new
versions can be obtained for free by calling 800-224-0948 (in the US).

Eight weeks into the first such lawsuit to go to trial, Apple Computer has
settled with the plaintiff who claimed her repetitive stress injuries were
incurred as a result of Apple's failure to warn about the potential for
RSI. One of the requirements in the settlement is that the terms be kept
secret. IBM, also named in the suit, has asked the judge to declare a
mistrial, saying that news of Apple's settlement was prejudicial.  The
judge has rejected that motion.  IBM says it does not intend to settle.

Apple Computer's recent move to settle the repetitive stress injury lawsuit
brought by a former high school secretary in Minnesota was prompted by
"errors" its law firm , Saperston &amp; Day, made in not turning over some
documents before the trial.  The judge had threatened to declare a mistrial
or impose sanctions because of the oversight.  Saperston &amp; Day will pay the
settlement.   (Wall Street Journal, 28 Feb 1995, B7)

The Computer Emergency Response Team has issued a public warning on a
vulnerability in some 20 commonly used e-mail programs that run on Unix
operating systems.  The advisory said the latest discovery could allow a
hacker to "read any file on the system, overwrite or destroy files."  The
ultimate solution to these recurrent security problems, says Purdue
University professor Eugene Spafford, is for consumers to demand better
security features from software manufacturers.  In the absence of improved
software, "are we going to continue seeing problems? You bet."  (Wall

A graduate student at the University of California at Berkeley has filed a
lawsuit against the federal government, charging it with unfairly limiting
his ability to discuss his research on encryption software.  The plaintiff
developed an equation for encrypting information, and wishes to publish a
paper on his work, as well as software based on his equation.  He would
also like to discuss his findings at professional meetings.  The federal
government's export-control laws restrict the publication of cryptographic
software and documentation.  The Electronic Frontier Foundation is handling
the plaintiff's case.  (Chronicle of Higher Education 3/3/95 A19)

Sen. James Exon (D-Neb.) has introduced legislation calling for two-year
prison terms for anyone convicted of sending obscene or harassing e-mail.
Commercial providers have protested, noting their service is more like a
telephone company, which is not held responsible for the conversations
carried over its conduits, but Exon remains unmoved: "If I were against
this, if I didn't want to be bothered with it, if I felt it might
complicate my ability to make money on the superhighway, that's the
argument I would make." Meanwhile the Center for Democracy and Technology
is pushing for more sophisticated filters that users could customize to
block specific types of messages. "You could have the Pat Robertson rating

the Center's founder.  (*Wall Street Journal*, 8 Feb 1995, p. B6)

gambling:
<BLOCKQUOTE>

	The Home Gambling Network:<BR>

	a Good Bet?

<P>
	NEW YORK--Surrounded by a sea of techno-suits discussing the 
	future of media convergence in a bidirectional world of 
	system-neutral platforms, the guy with the shaved head and 
	black leather jacket had to smirk.  "What's funny to me,"
	John Bates said, "is how tremendously clueless most of these 
	people are."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The author makes for the following key points:
<UL>
<LI> Gambling in the U.S. is a $400 billion industry.

<LI> A hundred people paid U$595 to attend a one-day conference in NYC
  entitled, "Interactive Gaming:  What's the Payoff?"

<LI> Thirty-one year old Bates is "on-line service director" for the
  Virtual Vegas company, which is proposing "cyberspace casinos 
  where real and computer-generated players interact in 3-D."

<LI> US federal law currently makes betting across interstate borders 
  using telecommunications illegal.

<LI> In practice, gamblers have been making off-shore bets on U.S. sports
  events over the phone using their bank credit cards.

<LI> The prospect of unlimited access to credit cards for gambling alarms
  some observers of addicted gamblers: "Give some people a 
  credit-card-reading device with a keypad hooked into their phones or 
  home computers--models of which were exhibited at the conference--and
  you're bound to have suckers blowing their life savings.  And minors 
  will find a way to log on to parental accounts."

<LI> In Quebec, an interactive TV show lets people order up to C$15 (~U$11) 
  of tickets a week (the limit is spelled out in legislation).

<LI> The UBI (Universal Bidirectional Interactive) Consortium based in 
  Montreal is working on a consumer-oriented electronic network which will
  include gambling services.

<LI> Some observers predict "a family-values backlash" against such
  computer-mediated gambling.

The story of the young trader who brought down Barings Bank captivates me as
much as it captivates the headline writers at the NY Post. James Glassman
wrote in the Washington Post (March 1, 95), "I don't mean to paint him as a
romantic hero, but he has reminded us-- in this age of huge financial
institutions guided by high-speed computers-- that one little guy can still
move the world." RISKS readers, though, should be intrigued because I
suspect that deep below all of this may be an intriguing datapoint on the
value of anonymity in the modern, electronic marketplace.
<P>
The Osaka Exchange publishes a weekly digest of the position. The Financial
Times quoted someone saying, "everyone knew of the trades" and "no one could
quite understand what Barings was doing with that sort of position."
<P>
This fact leads me to have some fun speculating on what happened. The
futures and options markets are quite different from the stock market.
Whenever someone loses a dollar, then someone else makes it. Value just
doesn't evaporate into smoke like it does on the stock market when everyone
decides a stock isn't worth it anymore. So every dollar that Barings lost
was gained by someone else.
<P>
What does this have to do with anonymity? Everything. There aren't many
people playing at these levels in the market so people can gang up on one
and other. It's much like games of bridge or hearts where everyone can work
together to stiff one player who might be in the lead.
<P>
If everyone knew that Barings was so deeply in the hole, they knew that it
might not take much to push Barings into bankruptcy. Just a bit more
selling in Tokyo and whammo, the firm is theirs at a huge selling price. No
need to negotiate payment terms or other factors. If the firm doesn't have
enough assets, the futures exchange might make up the difference from an
insurance fund.
<P>
The strategy that might have been in play was similar to the one that lead
to the table stakes rule in poker. The rule limits bets to the smallest pot
still in the hand. This prevents the richest player from winning every hand
by merely outbidding everyone. Don't play poker against Bill Gates without
it. (If you want to see what it could do to a marriage, check out the film
"Honeymoon in Vegas.")
<P>
There is no such rule in these markets and Barings should have known better
than to expose themselves to this risk. I suspect, though, that they might
have been much safer if their action was kept anonymous.
<P>
Of course this theory is just a theory. As Glassman would like to believe
that a little guy can still move the world, I want to believe that large
cabals can gang up on the little guy.

 [Source: COMPUTER HACKING AND THEFT RIFE IN WHITEHALL, by CHRIS BLACKHURST
 Westminster Correspondent, The Independent, 1 Mar 1995.]
<P>
Hacking into Whitehall computers soared last year, with a 140 percent rise
in the number of reported incidents.  An investigation by the National Audit
Office, the public finance watchdog, found that Government departments
reported 655 hacking incidents last year, of which 111 were successful.  Most
hackers were internal staff exceeding their authority to obtain unauthorised
information to leak to outsiders, and got oral or written warnings.  Twelve
percent of cases ended in legal action.
<P>
The report includes these items:
<UL>
<LI> Civil servants and outsiders conspired to defraud a Government department
of (pounds sterling) 1.5m.  Police are investigating and eight arrests have
been made.

<LI> A civil servant obtained personal details of colleagues to blackmail them.

<LI> A Government official obtained the private address of a married couple,
possibly to assist in the kidnapping of the wife.

<LI> Two staff members were prosecuted and fined (pounds sterling) 3,750 after
leaking computer data.
</UL>
Government computers are also increasingly prone to viruses and programmes
designed to harm data and other software. Last year, Government departments
and agencies reported a 350 percent rise in virus incidents, to 562. Over
half of these cases, NAO points out, were detected by anti-virus scanning
software.
<P>
Two outbreaks were labelled "significant" by the NAO:
<UL>
<LI> Thirty-eight viral infections were traced to one PC hard disk, loaded with
pirated computer games. Civil servants had been exchanging games by floppy
disks or through e-mail. The viruses were the games manufacturer's own
anti-bootlegging devices.

<LI> Four PCs in a Government typing pool had been infected with a virus which
took two days to eradicate.
</UL>
If hacking and viruses were not bad enough, theft, reports the NAO,
"continues to be a major problem, with portable computers, printers and
laptop computers being the main targets."
<P>
There were 433 reported incidents of theft of Government computer equipment
last year, a rise of 60 percent. In all, equipment costing (pounds
sterling) 1.2m was taken. This included two break-ins to the same office
within three months and the loss of equipment worth (pounds sterling)
102,000.  The thieves, who have not been caught, were thought to have been
"stealing to order." Likewise, the culprits behind the theft of 11 PCs and
other hardware, worth (pounds sterling) 55,000, have not been found.
<P>
In one of the more bizarre incidents, somebody went to the trouble of
taking a computer desk from a room and replacing it with an old one. The
locked drawers of the desk were broken into, and information, mostly
concerning the personal details of 300 staff, was scattered about.
<P>
The report also noted that The National Computing Centre's 1994 IT Security
Breaches Survey, covering a cross-section of industry and commerce, found
that 25 percent of businesses had suffered theft of computer equipment in
the previous two years.

&gt;  In other words, tell them not to hit the power switch until they see C:\.
<P>

Surely this relates to the previous RISKS discussion on power switches, and
Apple's deliberations on how best to implement them.
<P>
As Apple has realised, a few dollars spent on a software controllable power
switch largely solves the problem. Surely this is better than blaming users
for their entirely natural impatience with a machine which demands that
they wait while it closes itself down, before they are "allowed" to switch
it off. One of the major risks of the use of computers is that we end up
with computers controlling people rather than  vice versa.

In this case, it was stated here that there was supposed to be a limit on
the amount of money that the ATM card could withdraw, but an error in the
bank's computer allowed the thieves to steal $346,770. The victim had left
her ATM card, with the PIN number on it, in or near the ATM machine.
<P>
It makes sense to me that the victim should be responsible for her own
losses, to the limit of the card, since she gave away the number. (I
wonder, would I feel differently if she had been robbed and the PIN number
found hidden in her belongings?)  She should not be responsible for more
than the limit. The bank gave her the card and told her it was good for up
to $50 or $300 or whatever; the bank should be responsible if an error on
their part allowed more than this to be taken.
<P>
I wonder if any personal theft insurance policies cover losses from ATM
cards?

San Jose Mercury News' Action Line section, 15 Feb 1995:

<H4>SORRY, WRONG NUMBER</H4>

Q.  In October 1993, I received a statement from Medicare that my wife had
medical attention in Healdsburg from a Dr. John Fries.  I notified Medicare
that this was incorrect.  Neither of us had ever been in Healdsburg.
Medicare answered, thanking us.  The other day we received another letter
from Medicare showing that Fries had submitted another claim for treating my
wife.  It appears someone is using my wife's name and Medicare number to
obtain care.  Or maybe the doctor is making up these visits.  Could you
check into it?   C.E.F., San Jose
<P>
A. No one is using your wife's Medicare number; nor is the claim submitted
in a fraudulent manner, says Claudette Ballard, office manager for Fries.
The last time this happened and this time, too, Medicare's scanners misread
one of Fries' patients' Medicare number and picked up your wife's number.
Ballard says the scanner is somehow reading the fifth digit in the number
incorrectly and billing the service as if your wife received it.  Ballard
has contacted Medicare again and was assured steps would be taken so it
doesn't happen again.  She is writing you a letter to explain the problem in
more detail.

The press is starting to notice some of the serious privacy problems with
the rapidly advancing proposals for "Intelligent Transportation Systems" in
the United States.  Here are a couple of relevant articles:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  Richard Simon, Camera gains more exposure as a device for traffic control,
  Los Angeles Times, 20 February 1995, pages B1 and B3.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
This one is about the accelerating use of video cameras on roads in Southern
California.  In the near term they're mostly to identify the causes of traffic
jams.  But the Blue Line between Los Angeles and Long Beach will soon have
cameras to detect drivers who attempt to circumvent lowered gates to cross the
train tracks.  And although the state Office of Traffic Safety is concerned
about "a growing problem with commuters eating, reading, changing clothes,
brushing their teeth and generally paying less than full attention to the
road", it says it has no current plans to check up on these things with its
cameras.  
<P>
The cameras, in case you're wondering, are in bulletproof containers.
<P>
Although some of the problems that state traffic officials have identified 
are genuine, the real difficulty is in their basic philosophy for solving
them.  Rather than collect information and circulate it in a decentralized
fashion that is useful to individual drivers and engineering crews without
permitting unlimited accumulation of information that identifies individual
drivers, they have set up a general-purpose centralized observation center 
in downtown Los Angeles.
<P>
The slippery slope here is steep: as technologies of surveillance are put 
in place, new applications will always be available that are only one short
step beyond what they've been used for so far.  I am generally skeptical 
about visual metaphors for privacy problems, but this is one case where the
Panopticon offers a perfectly simple and straightforward model.
<P>
That's not so clear in another, much bigger and more consequential case:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  Don Phillips, Big Brother in the back seat?: The advent of the "intelligent
  highway" spurs a debate over privacy, Washington Post, 23 February 1995,
  page D10.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
This article concerns the "privacy principles" being circulated by the
Intelligent Transportation Society of America, which is the industry group
coordinating the development of a national architecture for transportation
automation systems, including systems that track the locations of vehicles 
for a range of purposes.  Although nobody in the United States is currently
proposing that the use of these technologies be made mandatory for drivers, 
it is very likely that they will become unavoidable as a practical matter, 
since they will probably be used to implement much more widespread roadway
toll-collection.  The most recent version of these principles that I have 
seen is dated December 13th 1994, and they are in fact seriously problematic.
For example, they only place very loose restrictions on secondary uses of the
information by marketers, and they envision no restrictions on the powers of
access to ITS travel information that individual states can confer upon local
police.  You can retrieve a copy by sending a message that looks like this:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  To: <A HREF="mailto:rre-request@weber.ucsd.edu">rre-request@weber.ucsd.edu</A><BR>
  Subject: archive send its-privacy
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Or you can look at them on WWW at:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <A HREF="http://weber.ucsd.edu/~pagre/its-privacy.html">http://weber.ucsd.edu/~pagre/its-privacy.html</A>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
I will probably circulate another message about these principles soon.  The
Phillips article notes that many people are concerned about law enforcement
uses of ITS information; ITS America feels that such use is inevitable and
simply wishes the public to be informed of this fact -- they wish to focus
on knowing "what the rules are" rather than on actual privacy.  The tragedy
is that it is completely unnecessary for these systems to collect information
that identifies individuals.  Profound violations of individual privacy are
not the price of progress.  Rather, they are the price of using old-fashioned
technology, neglecting innovations such as public-key cryptography and digital
cash that protect privacy without sacrificing functionality.

Memoirs of a (coastal) virus researcher
 <P>
Some people may not be aware that, by disconnecting the modem and attaching
a device known as a "telephone", communications circuits may be used for
voice communications.  Unfortunately, unlike email, "telephone" calls must
be synchronous (or, more correctly, bisynchronous) in that both parties must
be active on the circuit at the same time.  With the rise in modern
communications technologies, scenes like the following are becoming more
common:

<LI> The Manchester Guardian Weekly (week ending March 4, 1995) reported
that, in this year's Vienna Marathon, the runners will have to wear
specialized computer chips buried inside (or attached to) their shoelaces.
The purpose is to ensure that the runners stay on course.  Last year, some
took short cuts while an Italian rode some distance on the underground
(subway).  [LG: It is of course easy for one runner to help carry another's
shoelaces, but at least collusion is now required.]  <I>[Or, put your shoelaces

<LI>On a different matter, Cynthia Dwork of IBM Almaden wrote in ACM SIGACT
News 26(1) (March 1995) that the authentication procedure using public-key
systems in Lotus Notes, as described in its "Internals online book", has
security flaws.  Lotus's response is (1) the actual system does not work as
described in the manual and (2) how it actually works is proprietary
information.  [LG: (1) is dangerous by itself, and if (2) is true, then why
pretending to describe the procedure in the first place.]

It's probably old news for RISKS readers, but a very difficult concept for
lawmakers, that the semantic content of bit streams is in the eye of the
beholder, and that the apparent correspondence between bits and semantics is
the result of engineering convention and not an inherent property of the
bits.  Any attempt to legislate the content of digital communications is
therefore doomed to fail because it is trivial to hide the source of
semantic content.  The following is a simple example of how this can be
done; much more sophisticated examples are possible.
<P>
Imagine that Senator Exon's bill has pased, and it is now illegal to
transmit pornography on the net.
<P>
I take a pornographic image file P and encrypt it with a one-time pad.  That
is, I generate a string of random bytes the same length as P, and
exclusive-or corresponding bytes.  The encrypted image I put in a file
called F1 and the one-time-pad key I put in a file called F2.
<P>
F1 and F2 have some interesting properties.  They are both random bit
streams, completely devoid of semantic content.  In fact, there is no way to
tell which file contains the encrypted image and which file contains the
key.  They are mathematically indistinguishable.  All the information in P
is now encoded in the *correspondences* between the two files.  There is
really no information in either file. If either file is lost, P is
absolutely unrecoverable.
<P>
Now suppose that I email F1 to person A and F2 to person B.  Then A and B
exchange F1 and F2.  A and B each can now recover the original image. Has
the law been broken?  Who broke it?  All anyone did in the above scenario
was to send a random bit stream to someone else.  At no time did anyone send
a bit stream with any identifiable semantic content.
<P>
One might argue that I broke the law by sending out two files that I knew
could be combined to produce a pornographic image.  So imagine now that A
sends a random bit string F1 to B, who then uses this as a one-time pad to
encode P, which B then sends back to A.  Has the law been broken?  Who broke
it?
<P>
This scenario has an interesting subtlety.  In order to prove that B has
transferred information to A and not vice-versa it is necessary to prove
that A sent F1 *before* B sent F2 (since there is no way to distinguish F1
and F2).  So B could never be convicted of violating the law, since he could
always claim that he had sent F2 before receiving F1, and that therefore A
had transferred P to him rather than vice versa.  Even if the government had
timestamps to show that F2 was sent after F1, B could claim that this was
simply a retransmission.
<P>
If A and B exchange P in this way, then they can individually publish F1 and
F2, from which anyone can recover P, but both A and B can plausibly deny
having done anything but publishing a random bit stream.
<P>
The DA might try to prosecute both A and B on a conspiracy charge, but it is
not necessary for A and B to have conspired.  The mere knowledge that random
bit streams can be used in this manner might prompt some people to start
sending random bit streams around.  Without reliable time stamps there is no
way to trace the introduction of semantic content.  So as soon as anyone
starts to transmit one-time-pads, everyone can publish anything and no one
can be prosecuted for it.
<P>
The RISK here is that the government will not realize that attempts to
legislate content is a hunt for cybersnarks, and that transmitting random
bit streams may soon become a crime.

This week's Economist (issue of March 4) has an article about the attitude
of the Singapore govt to soc.culture.singapore and the idea of the Internet
in general.  
<P>
The Singapore govt is perhaps not the most liberal in the world, and in
particular is highly critical of "western influence".  On the one hand it
seeks to keep Singapore technologically up to date by wiring the country to
the Internet, on the other hand it seeks to maintain control over what its
population sees, two obviously incompatible goals.  In particular it's
concerned about "incorrect" things written in soc.culture.singapore.  The
information minister, George Yeo, suggests that the youth league of the
ruling People's Action Party should set up some sort of truth squad to
counteract incorrect posts.
<P>
This is a road down which I would just as soon not have a government walk.
Could they resist taking the next step, namely forging cancellations and so
forth (as for instance, the Church of Scientology seems to have done)?
<P>
The Internet _is a threat to any regime that tries to restrict in anyway
what their people see.  My own feeling is that any attempt to control it,
short of disconnecting it altogether, will be doomed.  As The Economist
notes, on the Internet, nobody gets the last word.  However, I imagine there
will be numerous battles before that sinks in.  I wonder how many
intelligence agencies now have separate Internet sections, studying such
things as Internet sabotage methods and the like.

<LI>Denise Bayless' PC found scrambled data and software on the hard-drive.

<LI> ``This year has been the worst, without question,'' said Ken Coleburn,
owner of a computer consulting firm in Tempe.  His company fielded 140 calls
this year, compared with about 30 last year.  He suggested this might have
been due to Michelangelo's birthday falling on a workday this year.

<LI> RG Software Systems in Scottsdale, Ariz., which sells anti-virus software
to large companies worldwide, was contacted by three prospective customers

Suppliers admit to spreadsheet errors [Computing, 2nd March 1995, p.11]
<P>
Microsoft and Lotus Development have admitted that their spreadsheet
products may produce inaccurate results because of an inherent problem with
the design of all computers.  Mistakes can occur in precision calculations,
of the kind required by engineers and users in the scientific, banking and
finance sectors.
<P>
Andy Lees, desktop marketing manager at Microsoft UK, said rounding errors
may sometimes occur in Excel calculations set to a significant number of
decimal places.  He said this was due to the conversion of base 10 decimal
numbers into base 2 binary digits recognised by computers.  Lees played down
the problem, saying the margins of error was `very small' and that few would
come across it.
<P>
However, users in at least one large merchant bank were last week warned to
take extra care over calculations in Excel.  Barry Ward, technical support
manager at Computacenter, which is providing the bank with PC support
services, fears users may be unaware of the problem.  He added that the bank
stumbled across the error when one of its users manually checked
calculations against computer-generated results.  `I've been in the computer
business for 19 years and have never come across this problem before.  In my
opinion, this could throw a spanner in the works for a large multinational
company,' he added.
<P>
The user was adding and subtracting a simple set of figures: 120, 30.8, 20.5
and -120, -30.8 and -20.5.  Instead of zero, the result produced was -1.43
E-15.  Ward claimed changing the order of numbers produced different
results.
<P>
According to Microsoft's Lees: `There is a limit to the level of accuracy
you can get with computers.  In Excel a rouding error will sometimes appear
on the fourteenth or fifteenth decimal place, but it will be very small.
Excel has a high degree of accuracy.'
<P>
Lotus Development acknowledged that some users require high levels of
precision in calculations, but claimed that rounding errors in its 1-2-3
spreadsheet can be avoided by formatting cells.
<P>
[This article reminds me of part of a course during my degree looking at 
the problem of calculations in the Floating point domain (|F).  It is often
wrongly assumed that |F and the Real domain (|R) are equivalent, but because
of limits in the space to store a number, while it is always true that
  a+b-b = a; a,b member of |R, 
it is NOT always true that 
  a+b-b = a; a,b member of |F.  
The course also looked into ways of designing algorithms to try and detect
and prevent errors of this kind occurring.]

We have just finished a working paper on spreadsheet errors.  The working
paper describes our experiment.  It also discusses earlier experiments and
field audits.  The paper also presents a taxonomy of spreadsheet errors.
<P>
The good news is that laboratory spreadsheeters only have about the error
rate per cell as professional programmers do per program statement.  The bad
news is that while professional programmers go on to the next step of deep
debugging, spreadsheet developers do not do this frequently.  Overall, it
looks like a significant fraction of the hundreds of millions of
spreadsheets produced each year have errors.

I recently encountered two RISKS surrounding cash registers. The first
occurred while I was on holiday in Arizona. I was caught in a downpour on
the golf course and decided to buy an inexpensive t-shirt at the drug store.
The shirt was on *special* sale, three for ten dollars. When I went to pay
for the shirt, the clerk had no problem remembering the price, but an
insurmountable problem entering the price into the cash register. No matter
what he tried, the register was beeping and chirping everytime he tried to
enter 1/3 of $10.00 as a price. (Perhaps this was simple human error, but
there is still a RISK here...) After a rather long line was starting to form
in my line, I said to this gentleman, "look, just ring it in as $3.50." He
said he couldn't do that and kept trying to enter the proper price. After
what seemed like ten or fifteen tries, he managed to enter something that
was accepted by the register, and turned and smiled at me and said, ".06
cents please."
<P>
And then, just last week, I needed a shallot for something I was cooking.
The grocery store I went to had some very expensive shallots, something like
16$ a pound! So I took a very small bud and went up to the cash register.
The clerk put the bud on the scale, and it came up as 0.0 ounces, which it
would not accept. (The scale automatically deducted .1 ounce for the plastic
bag.) But I hadn't put a bag on the shallot. Once again, after several
tries, and a line forming behind me, I suggested she just tip the scale with
her thumb. She wouldn't go for it. She let me have the shallot for free.
<P>
The RISKS here seems to be when technological advances do not allow for
other alternatives.These automated registers probably do make balancing the
books a lot easier at the end of the day, but they don't seem to be very
flexible. In the old days, both clerks could have simply entered any price
they wanted in their registers. Nowadays, with their complete reliance on
these automated registers, balancing the register and not the balance sheet
seemed foremost to these clerks. And for lucky consumers like me, sometimes
we end up with .06 cent t-shirts and free shallots.

[Article in Computing, 2 March 1995, front page]
<P>
Risk system comes too late to prevent Barings' collapse
<P>
Collapsed merchant bank Barings was only months away from installing
a risk management system in its Far East offices which was intended to 
alert senior executives to gambles being taken with the company's money.
<P>
Barings, the UK's oldest investment house, was plunged into financial ruin 
last weekend when 28-year old Nick Leeson lost more than UKP 750 million
of clients' funds on the Singapore derivatives exchange.
<P>
In January 1994, the bank began rolling out a communications architecture
called BORIS (Barings Order Routing &amp; Information System) to improve the 
processing of information about deals.  Prior to this, Barings staff had
used paper and fax machines to excahnge information.
<P>
BORIS had gone live in London, Tokyo and New York, with Barings' Far East
offices, including Singapore, set to follow by mid-1995.  An extension to
BORIS, dealing specifically with risk management, went live in London HQ
in the last few weeks and was also set to be rolled out in the Far East
in the near future.
<P>
Dealing in derivatives involves betting on the movement of shares on national
stock exchanges and carries substantial risk of losing vast amounts of money.
<P>
Frank Ranger, a director of City Consultants, said any system intended to 
manage that risk needs access to data from every market involved in the 
transactions.  `There is a clear need to get consolidated informatin from 
products in some sort of control function,' he said.
<P>
Peter Hynd, Barings' assistant IT director, was unavailable for comment,
but sources believe the bank's existing settlement system contributed to
the collapse.
<P>
The Cash Risk Management system was supposed to flag cash positions, but
if settlements were not processed according to the bank's procedures, it
could not do so.

As the Derivative fiasco continues to unfold I keep thinking about how much
it sounds like the typical computer risk though it is an age old financial
fiasco. But the resemblance is not just coincidence and it helps in putting
the computer risks in perspective. The key characteristic of both is that
the effect of an action is out of proportion to the action itself and is not
(easily?) predictable. In both cases, hubris is the killer. Fortune had an
update on article on the issues (pun?). It is a world populated by those who
invest millions or billions on hunches and, even more scary, make bets best
of formulas they do not understand. Perhaps no one understands. Sounds like
software. (Sounds also like the sophomore effect -- a naive belief in the
magic of the new trick one has just learned)
<P>
Like software, used with a reasonable understanding and modest goals, 
derivatives can be effective tools (ironically, to reduce risk). Like 
software, complexity and a lack of reality checking leads to disaster. And 
like software, success can breed disaster by encouraging one to plunge deeper 
and deeper. A billion dollars is a lot to lose, but companies have been 
brought down by software bugs.

``The one thing the Barings episode illustrates is the productivity for
making losses has gone up very significantly in the last 25 years.  You
couldn't write the execution slips fast enough 25 years ago to lose as much
money as was lost by one idividual, aided by terrific technology.''

We use a light box containing four fluorescent tubes for SAD (Seasonal

TV &amp; VCR wouldn't 'control' when the light box was on.  This seems to be the
same symptoms that Suffern noticed with compact fluorescent lights.

I suppose this isn't really a computer Risk, but someone might find it
interesting anyway. Edward S Suffern's report of compact fluorescent lights
causing malfunctions in his infrared remote control devices (<A HREF="/Risks/16.84.html">RISKS-16.84</A>)
reminded me of a related problem that I ran into in my former job as the
chief technician for a cable televison system.
<P>
My installer had reported a problem with a converter that he had just
installed (to aid in converter control, installers were issued only enough
of set top units to complete their scheduled installations for the day. Any
problems encountered were referred to allegedly more trustworthy members of
the technical staff.) This converter was equipped with an infra-red remote
control device. When I arrived at the subscriber's home, the display on the
converter was showing "7" and no matter what channel I attempted to turn it
it to, the converter always changed back to channel 7. I installed another
box, assuming that it would solve the problem--CATV converters are
notoriously unreliable despite what your local cable company might tell you.
The new converter exhibited exactly the same behavior.
<P>
Baffled, I stood next to the TV set scratching my head until I happened to
turn towards the viewer's sofa and noticed sunshine glinting off the
whirling, chrome-plated blades of an electric fan running by the window--and
a lightbulb went on inside my head. Sure enough, when I turned the fan off,
the problem went away. Turning the fan back on caused the problem to
reappear.
<P>
It seems that the moving blades of the fan were pulse-modulating the
sunshine in exactly the right manner to confuse the infra-red receiver in
the converter into thinking it was getting the "change to channel 7" command
from the remote.
<P>
I spent almost another ten years in the industry after that and never ran
accross that particular problem again.

energy saving fluorescent lights affecting TVs and other remote controlled
equipment, suspecting that these type of bulbs emit infra-red enough to
confuse remote receivers. This is slightly inaccurate. Energy saving light
bulbs actually emit less infra-red radiation than a normal incadescent bulb.
However, the light is "strobing" at the 50kHz range, which is about the same
as the pulse frequncy of a common remote control. Some receivers (simpler
designs) get confused by this, and that's what caused the malfunction.

News item from the Detroit Free Press, 8 March 1995.
<P>
A Detroit area woman last week looked at her Caller ID box (manufactured by
CIDCO, Morgan Hills, CA) and was puzzled to notice that it indicated 19
received calls that evening, even though only one person had called.  Then
she checked the names listed.  John F. Kennedy.  Thomas Paine.  Harry S
Truman.  John Hancock.  Ulysses S. Grant.  Samuel Clemens.  Ronald Reagan.
And many others.
<P>
Most of the phone numbers were non-working, but a few were.  Ryan Biermann,
an English student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison has been plagued
with phone calls for Abraham Lincoln recently.
<P>
No definitive explanation has been given.  Ameritech (the Baby Bell
for Detroit and Madison) believes the Caller ID box was probably
a pre-programmed demonstration model.  Dave Glowacz, a telecommunications
consultant in Chicago, suspects the work of a phone hacker.
<P>
Depending on the cause, lots of old Risks here (either a faulty
demonstration circuit with non-fake data or an insecure data system), but
perhaps with a new face to them.
<P>
Addendum: accompanying the article is a photo of the Caller ID box listing
Abraham Lincoln's name and phone number.  I hope Mr. Biermann won't be
getting too many more phone calls because of it ...

  <P>
  Islamabad: The Pakistan government has forced the US telecommunications
  giant, Motorola, to halt mobile telephone service to the country's
  strife-torn city, Karachi. Pakistani officials are demanding Motorola
  hand over sophisticated eavesdropping equipment that would allow
  intelligence agencies to tap into phone calls made on the company's
  cellular network. Analysts are saying the  government's action is not
  encouraging to foreign investors.  The Pakistan government claims it is
  trying to crack down on Karachi terrorists using mobile telephones to
  coordinate attacks and organize violence in the ravaged city.
 <P> 
  In a memo to James Beneda, the president of Mobilink -- Motorola's
  Pakistani joint venture -- the communications ministry demanded
  equipment needed to tap into all calls made by its subscribers be given
  to the government.
 <P> 
  Without these sophisticated scanners, intelligence agents would not be
  able to tap into the cellular network.  It is the first time the
  government has admitted such tapping and eavesdropping is commonplace
  in Pakistan.  Mobilink's service to Karachi was cut by the government
  January fourth.
 <P> 
  According to Mobilink's regional manager, Zahid Hussain, two other
  cellular phone companies presently operating in Karachi have not had
  their service interrupted because their calls are easily tapped. "The
  facility the other two cellular companies have, all you do is buy a
  200-dollar scanner from Hong Kong or wherever, and you can walk the
  streets and just keep tuning into different frequencies and listening
  to people's conversations."
  <P>
  Mr. Hussain says his company will comply with some of the government's
  demands and will deliver the mobile scanning equipment sometime this
  month.  But, there remain other obstacles to resuming operations.  The
  government has also demanded Mobilink not expand its number of
  subscribers from the present 3000 -- a request mobilink officials say
  they cannot possibly honor.
<P>  
  US state department officials and Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown are
  said to have brought the matter to the attention of Pakistan's
  Washington Ambassador, Maleeha Lodhi.
<P>  
  The US-based company has invested more than 32-million dollars in
  establishing its Pakistani operation since last August, and intended to
  invest nearly 20-million dollars more this year.
<P>  
  The scandal has caused many foreign businessmen to rethink their
  investment in Pakistan, where they say licensing agreements are easily
  rewritten and often disregarded.  Mr. Hussain says the government's
  handling of the incident sends a negative signal to foreign investors,
  particularly on the eve of prime minister Benazir Bhutto's trip next
  month to the United States.

|Barry Ward, ... `I've been in the computer business for 19 years and <BR>
|have never come across this problem before.  ...
<P>
I find it difficult to imagine someone who's been in the computer business
for two decades and has never heard of floating point round-off errors.
This should be part of any computer science curriculum.
<P>
Of course, part of the problem is that 20 years ago, virtually all business
software was written in COBOL or PL/I, and that's probably Mr. Ward's
background.  These languages provide fixed-point decimal as a built-in data
type, and require that decimal arithmetic be done accurately.  There may
still be round-off errors (e.g. dividing 100 by 3, or multiplying .01 by
.01 and putting the result in a variable with two digits after the decimal
point), but the programmer has direct control over the level of precision.
<P>
These days, end users use spreadsheets to write "business software", and
the spreadsheet designers seemed to have forgotten how business software
has traditionally worked.  The spreadsheet implementors are simply using
the built-in mathematics that C provides, which is not appropriate for this
problem domain.  Floating point was designed for scientific computing --
it's often not much of a problem that errors are introduced, since there's
an inherent imprecision in the input data (since it's translated from the
analog real world to the digital cyber world).

What about going in the other direction?  If you take an image file or some
other data file (say a core dump file) that appears random, apply some
simple operations (say XOR with various values) to it and run the output
through a program that filters out everything except strings of
alphanumerics (such as the Unix "strings" program), eventually you're bound
to come up with with something that contains some obscene words, possibly
"misspelled".  A zealous prosecutor could use this to "prove" that the
original was an encrypted form of obscene text.

An undeveloped photo becomes evidence of crime when it's developed and

doesn't change this.  Whether a crime was committed wouldn't rest on
mechanisms of imaging, therefore, but on the image transmitted.  If
it's deemed porn, chances are all three of you broke the law (plus
conspiracy to commit same, given the way you went about it.)  Lectures
to judge or jury on the mathematical properties of the tools used will
probably seem to them like lectures on thin film chemistry.
<P>

<P>
That would be the prosecution's argument, yes.

<P>
A has conspired with B to effect the transmission of images deemed
pornographic from B to A.  I wouldn't bet the rent on any judge or

<P>

<P>
Oh?  We couldn't recover P from A or B's storage?<BR>
Or talk to someone who knew where P came from?<BR>
If we do, we don't need to know anything about F1 or F2.<BR>
We know where P came from and where it went to.
<P>
Even without that, if timestamp records conflict with B's claims,
we simply have to choose which one we believe.  B's claims might
be found credible, and might not.  The judge or jury decide.
<P>
On either grounds, B's toast under a variety of circumstances.

| F1 and F2, from which anyone can recover P, but both A and B can<BR>
| plausibly deny having done anything but publishing a random bit stream.
<P>
The key word here is "plausibly"; plausible to whom?  Judge or jury
might find it less than plausible that A and B engaged in the generation
and distribution of random bit streams, which later just happened to
form images in combination.
<P>
| The DA might try to prosecute both A and B on a conspiracy charge,<BR>
| but it is not necessary for A and B to have conspired.  The mere<BR>

<P>
The above discussion should demonstrate why this is a rather
naive view.  However anyone who wants to give it a whirl is
welcome to; it's your nickel.  The danger lies instead in
an equally naive view:

<P>
And therefore we need do nothing.  Wrong.  The fact is that clever
games such as these will not impress the judicial system nor derail
the legislative process.  If the law gets on the books it will work
its damage.  Such schemes as suggested above will be looked on as
what they are, attempts to evade it or confuse its enforcement;
little will be gained; it might even be counterproductive.  No,
if we want to stop Senator Exon's nonsense, we have to do it the
old fashioned way: organizing, lobbying, informing, and persuading.

Erann Gat's article on semantics (<A HREF="/Risks/16.87.html">RISKS-16.87</A>) provides a nice example of
the difficulties of identifying any bit stream with certainty.
Unfortunately it also provides an example of an all too common Risk:
Engineers confusing scientific "proof" with that of a legal nature.
 <P>
Censorship is already enforced on the internet.  In particular, allowing 
transfer of encryption technology out of the U.S. is illegal.  This leads 
to awkward situations for companies who's products include security, but
by Gat's arguments they can get around the problem by simply encoding the
software and sending it as two "random" bit streams.  Anyone who decides to 
try this, please be sure to let us all know...
<P>
Sarcasm aside, I don't think anyone believes that Department of Commerce
(or Defense, or whoever enforces that restriction) would even slow down
on their way to the courthouse because the information was encrypted.  Intent
is far more important than encoding, and I don't believe they'd have any
trouble with a conviction.
<P> 
But back to the basic Risk:  Engineers forgetting the end users and
getting wrapped up in notions of mathematical certainty and "solid" proof.
Remember:  your firewall _supports_ an overall security policy.  Your
automated flight system _supports_ a pilot.  Your software filters _support_
the legal system.  
<P>
In all these cases the software is not the end all be all, but an aid to 
accomplishing some other task.  At some point we may feel comfortable 
replacing humans with software completely for these uses, but RISKS forum
itself is a testimony to how far off that actually is.

Unfortunately, our legal system is not advanced enough to recognize the
subtle differences described above.  The authorities will wait until the two
parts are combined.  They will then seize every piece of hardware which
appears to be associated with the image.  Anyone who happens to be in the
mail header will be arrested.  During the trial, the reconstructed image is
all the jury will see, understand or remember.  They will fall asleep during
the expert witness testimony regarding public key cryptography.  This is the
RISK of living in a society which is heavily dependent on technology, but
whose users are not very well educated.

I would like to take issue with Tarl Neustaedter for saying, in effect,
that Sun's decision to have its SPARC computers go into the ROM Monitor
when you unplug the keyboard is a FEATURE and not a BUG.
<P>
Mr. Neustaedter eloquently says, basically, the following:
<OL>
        <LI>Sometimes you need to be able to interrupt the computer.
        <LI>User software can completely remap the keyboard.
        <LI>Therefore, we need some signal that can't be remapped to get the
           user into the ROM Monitor.
        <LI>The only thing left is unplugging the keyboard and plugging it
           back in.
</OL>
Here are some things to consider:
<OL>
        <LI>First at fault is the ROM monitor itself, which has one of the
most un-user-friendly prompts I have ever seen. The menus are difficult to
read; the commands are not neatly formatted; it's just not clear for
non-technical people what to do.

        <LI>I am sure that more files have been left by some poor secretary
or other non-technical person accidentally unplugging the keyboard and then
plugging it back in (and consequently getting trapped at the ROM prompt),
then have been saved by UNIX weenies who have known that they could trap
into the ROM monitor by playing this game with the keyboard plug.

        <LI>Mr. Neustaedter's note that this functionality can be disabled
by hand-editing the function call to abort_sequence_error() in the function
zsa_xsint() in the file zs_async.c is the typical UNIX weenie response: if
you don't like it, then search through the source-code (or object code) and
fix it yourself.
</OL>
        Yes, it is wonderful that UNIX gives its users such flexibility.
But it's also clear that UNIX was designed for small research labs where
the users want this sort of flexibility, and not for general use. Putting
UNIX into general distribution is dangerous: it's dangerous for the users,
and dangerous for those who have to give support to the users.

This has been a feature of Sun Workstations at least since the Sun-2s. I
worked on a project in 1985 with six rack mounted Suns each supporting 6
diskless Suns. There was a table beside each rack and on the table was a
keyboard. No CRTs of any kind to be seen. I don't know why, but periodically
someone would decide that they needed one of these keyboards.  With the
result that at least six Suns (generally more as NFS mounts to the now hung
server would fail) would freeze up until we could get the keyboard back and
reboot the server.
<P>
Just last year I was stung by this feature. I was to give a demo on a Sparc
10. Some one had connected the mouse off the left side of the keyboard and I
decided I needed it on the right. So I immediately unplugged the mouse then
proceeded to disconnect the cable on the right side, and the Sparc 10
proceed to crash. After reconnecting the cables I attempted to reboot. Well
it failed to reboot and later it was discovered that one key file had been
corrupted (I forget which one).

This is a good topic for a trivia question in the Computer Bowl. I bet SMI
borrowed the break behavior from PDP-11s. I'm not sure when it was
introduced into the PDP-11 family (certainly by the mid 70's), but holding
the break key for a bit on the console caused a "framing error halt". On a
PDP-11/03, this dropped you into the microcode monitor. On machines without
a monitor, you had to restart it from the front panel with all the funky
lights.
<P>
Anyways, it served a useful purpose. On the RSX-11 operating system, you
could schedule a job with a priority higher than the command line
interpreter.  If this job went into an infinite loop, it could not be
terminated.  The solution was to stop the machine with the break key, and
poke around in kernel memory to remove the job (there were various ways to
do this.) Hopefully, when the machine was restarted, it would be back to
normal.

Disconnecting the keyboard is the same as the L1-A interrupt which throws
Suns (since Model 3s) into their monitor program.  Typing "c" for continue
will let the cpu resume unixing.
<P>
This is indeed obscure behavior if you don't know about it :-0 Most
computers have arcane stuff like this mentioned (once) in their voluminous
manuals.
<P>
Computers aren't the only such systems: there are cars you can shut down by
kicking in the right place, where you activate a sensor that shuts off the
fuel pump, for instance.
<P>
The problem with big systems is no one reads (or understands) whatever
descriptions of it there might be.

&gt; There seems to be some confusion over the giant iceberg.  [...]<BR>
&gt; The Reuters news agency reported that the iceberg was 656 feet 2<BR>
&gt; inches thick, implying a tremendous accuracy of measurement.  It<BR>
&gt; is actually 200 m thick and the reporter converted this to English<BR>
&gt; units.  Reuters also reported that this event was the result of a<BR>
&gt; 36.5 F increase in temperature since the 1940's.  It was actually<BR>
&gt; a 2.5 C increase.  The reporter apparently converted this to F<BR>
&gt; as a temperature rather than a temperature difference.<BR>
&gt; I don't know whether this speaks more for the educational level of<BR>
&gt; reporters or more for the fact we should all be using SI units.
<P>
The risks of the transmission of technical information by people who don't
know what they are talking about will be familiar to RISKS readers.  Perhaps
more striking is the risk that something as simple as a Celsius to
Fahrenheit conversion algorithm can be misused by making invalid assumptions
about context.

Headline: Two on net porn charges
<P>
An 11-month investigation by West Midlands police has led to two men being
charged with distributing child pornography on the Internet.  The charges
arise from a raid by police on the metallurgy department at Birmingham
University following information on child pornography passed to them by
federal authorities in the United States.  ...  The prosecution is seen as
[a] test case on what can be legally transmitted globally across the network
from computer hosts.

I was interested to see the examples of optical remote-control systems being
upset by other light sources.  In my student days I worked as a TV engineer
in holidays.  A customer complained that his set would randomly switch
channels.  Several weeks of to-ing and fro-ing to the workshop failed to
find a problem.  Eventually the cause was found.  The customer kept budgies
in an aviary outside the window next to the TV.  The set had an ultrasonic
remote control.  The budgies were setting off the remote.  If you made the
budgies tweet, the set changed its channel.
<P>
These risks are still there 20 years later.

Has anybody heard of consumer electronic stuff being recalled because of
software problems yet?  The reason I ask is that most such products will
have massive amounts of software in them by the end of the decade, (many
tens of thousands of lines in such things as televisions, cars, washing
machines, electric razors and so on).
<P>
As an example:
<P>
In August'94 I rented a Vauxhall Omega car for 1 month.  This car was brand
new and consequently has a number of micro-processor controlled systems.
<P>
In the first week, the sun-roof started to oscillate (in the rain!).  The
sun-roof is a simple rotating switch which you turn to the position you want
the roof and then leave it to move there.  Mildly concerned and alternately
dampened by this, my eldest son figured out that by pushing the button, the
roof reset.  On looking through the manual, in tiny writing at the back,
this featurette was described, "in case of some circumstances when the
sun-roof ...".
<P>
One week later, I discovered one morning that the car was completely without
power - not even the control panel lights came on.  A volt-meter revealed
that the battery was perfectly OK.  A call to the RAC (Royal Automobile
Club, a UK organisation that operates a rescue service like the US. AAA),
brought an engineer out who said it was one of two things, one of which he
could fix.  He moved the drive lever from Park to Drive and back and all the
lights came on and the engine would then start.  (The drive train is also
controlled by a microprocessor in this car).  I asked him what was the one
he couldn't fix.  He said that on this model, the auto immobiliser (the cute
little button on the key ring) could in some circumstances at the edge of
its range so immobilise the car that only the factory could get it going,
(the ultimate theft deterrent!).  I suspect that this is also controlled by
a microprocessor.  In fact on this car, the radio is controlled by two
microprocessors !
<P>
In terms of reliability growth modelling, one person experiencing two
defects and hearing of another in just one month in one car adds up to a
shaky reliability record.
<P>
Hence my question at the beginning.  Maybe its just me, because I'm in the
profession.

<A HREF="/Risks/16.88.html">RISKS-16.88</A> includes a transcript of a Voice of America broadcast describing
Pakistan's hardball play to get access to Motorola's best cellular
eavesdropping technology. The transcript says that Pakistan shut down
Motorola's cellular service until it got the device that would let them
eavesdrop on all conversations.
<P>
I'm not sure if Motorola complied, but I hope that someone asked these
questions:
<OL>
<LI> Can this eavesdropping hardware work in the United States? Many speculate
that Pakistan wants to be (or is) a member of the nuclear club of nations.
When a Princeton undergraduate designed a nuclear bomb for credit, he was
visited by someone who seemed to be a Pakistani intelligence operative. The
goal? Nuclear information.

<LI>Can this eavesdropping hardware work against Motorola? Industrial
espionage is a popular way for countries to do "research." Does Pakistan
want to build up a local electronics company?

<LI> Can this eavesdropping hardware be used against US companies angling for
business in Pakistan?

<LI>Will the technology make its way into the hands of the terrorists?
Several days ago, US citizens were killed in an ambush. The dead included at
least one intelligence operative. Today's Washington Post says that some
witnesses claimed a police car with a submachine gun mounted on the top
stood by idling and let the killers get away. The excuse is that they were
afraid. The ambush was supposedly retaliation for the US capture of
terrorists.
</OL>
Years ago, we only needed to worry about whether we could trust our
immediate neighbors and the other folks in town. Now trust is a global game.

The Sparc10 story reminds me of my 486 PC running BSD/OS; it was configured to
ask for rebooting if you press CTRL+Alt+Delete as default. I immediately 
disabled this feature. I even consider this a bug, although you can fix it
by recompiling the kernel. 
<P>
Think about this. Most MS-DOS users know CTRL+Alt+Delete, and many
of them just do it if they think they have done something wrong with their
PCs. And few of them know the difference between MS-DOS and BSD/OS; what if
they start to use BSD/OS? Rebooting everytime they think they've got crashed?
<P>
BSD/OS has another design flaw on its X server. You can terminate it anytime
by pressing CTRL+Alt+Backspace. This is enabled as default, though you can
turn this off by its configuration file. I respect flexibility of UNIX, but
it's obviously dangerous to enable emergency-stop features to everybody.

Errors in financial calculations are not new.  When I worked at Autex, Inc.
in the early 70's I wrote a program to calculate bond tables.  I was told
that my calculations, right or wrong, had to agree with a certain book that
all the traders used.  Bond prices were given in dollars and cents and I was
told that a difference of one cent was unacceptable.  A one cent error in a
large trade could easily cost more than a Wall Street lunch for two, hence
was significant.
<P>
The bond table book gave the formula used and indicated the method of 
rounding.  It was very easy to duplicate these calculations,  but would they 
agree using a different processor?  By printing out my own version of the 
book and comparing each entry by hand I found only a single error, in the 
amount of one cent.  In the early 70's fancy desk calculators still ruled.  
The one I happened to have had a switch that controlled rounding mode (down, 
up, halfway)  so it could do interval arithmetic. Cranking the calculation 
on this calculator to 15 digits I was able to bound the correct value.  It 
was almost exactly halfway between two pennies, and my rounding was correct. 
(This didn't surprise me as I had used 64 bit floating point,  a large 
number of guard digits indeed for a four decimal place answer.)
<P>
Knowing that I was right and the book wrong was a nice position. I discussed 
this with my boss and we decided to stick with our value.  I secretly hoped 
there would be a dispute someday between two traders over this entry,  
figuring that I could somehow turn this into a nice lunch.  No such chance.
<P>
Do people still use these old tables?  How many have errors?

Flight International, 1-7 February 1995, reports the loss of a
Rockwell-Daimler-Benz Aerospace X-31A enhanced fighter-manoeuverability
research aircraft on 19 January 1995. `Investigations [..] are
focusing on the air-data system, say sources close to the project.
  "There is a possibility that hardware operation of some of the systems
may be involved [and] it cannot be excluded that the instruments were
giving false readings," says one source, adding that there is no indication
that the aircraft's advanced flight control system was involved [..].'
<P>
Flight International, 8-14 February 1995, reports that investigations are
centred on the pitot-static system (which measures altitude and airspeed by
means of pressure differentials, and that pitot icing is suspected by some.
`The aircraft was [...] in straight-and-level flight, when [the pilot]
detected false airspeed readings, followed by pitch oscillations. These
increased and were followed by a violent roll before [the pilot] ejected.'
<P>
So, investigators suspect that false sensor readings caused by icing-up of
the sensors led to inappropriate actions of the flight control system which
led to loss of control.  Generally, airplanes which may fly in instrument
conditions, i.e. clouds, including my Piper Archer, are equipped with pitot
heat to avoid similar problems, but if my pitot ices up, all I lose is my
airspeed indicator, and not my control. A colleague who is a Chief Engineer
at NASA Dryden, where the accident took place, points out that airplanes
such as F4s, which are not fly-by-wire airplanes, have also been lost when
false sensor readings led to inappropriate actions of the flight control
system - but in the case of an F4 it is a mechanico-hydraulic system rather
than a computer.  She suggests that a distinction be made between the flight
control system itself, which implements the control laws, and the system
that sends signals to the actuators to wiggle the control surfaces.
<P>
While we may not be able to ascribe the `fault' to a `computer' in this
case, it does raise the continuing issue as to how one ascribes faults.  It
is always possible in theory to replace a computer control system by wires,
pulleys, hydraulics, bells and whistles - but not to fit all this hardware
in the same airplane all at the same time. For example, Airbus argues that
its computer-controlled airplanes are `evolutionary', that is, the same
control characteristics could be achieved with more traditional control
systems - and the only consequence of computer control is weight savings,
and therefore extended range or the ability to carry more passengers. This
is debatable. The more interconnection between systems contributing to
control (possible when most things are software unless extreme care is
taken), the more opportunity for an inappropriate sensor reading to send
everything haywire. The X-31 would not be able to fly without computer
control. It is true that any individual system fault may be replicated by
means of wires, pulleys and hydraulics. But I doubt that this knowledge
would help anyone to analyse the fault and prevent its reoccurrence. I
suspect that techniques developed by computer scientists for dealing with
safety-critical computers are more useful.  Whereas in the case of my
Archer, only plumbers would be involved ........

<H4>PGP Moose</H4>
by Greg Rose &lt;<A HREF="mailto:Greg_Rose@sydney.sterling.com">Greg_Rose@sydney.sterling.com</A>&gt;
<P>
The aim of this software is to monitor the
contents of consenting moderated newsgroups, and
to automatically cancel messages that appear in
the newsgroup without having been authorised by
the moderator(s) of the group. This has
(obviously) been prompted by the recent spammings.
<P>
PGP, the crux of the cryptographic software, was
written by Phil Zimmermann &lt;<A HREF="mailto:prz@acm.org">prz@acm.org</A>&gt;, who
otherwise has nothing to do with this. The
cryptographic framework was written by Greg Rose
&lt;<A HREF="mailto:Greg_Rose@sydney.sterling.com">Greg_Rose@sydney.sterling.com</A>&gt;. The INN news
system hooks are being provided by Chris Lewis
&lt;<A HREF="mailto:clewis@ferret.ocunix.on.ca">clewis@ferret.ocunix.on.ca</A>&gt;.

<H5>How Does It Work?</H5>
When a moderator wants to protect their group from
forged/unapproved postings, they should register
their interest with one or more of the sites
running PGP Moose, and pick up the submission
script. As part of this process, the moderator
would specify a PGP public key that is allowed to
approve postings.
<P>
When a post comes in, and the moderator wishes to
approve it, they do whatever they would normally
do before actually using inews (or whatever) to
post the message. As their last action, they run
the PGP Moose Approval program "pmapp". This
inserts a special form of Approved: header which
looks like this:
<PRE>
Approved: PGP Moose V0.9 950310 sci.crypt.research
	  iQBVAgUBL1/Kg2zWcw3p062JAQEYIgH/Xyrz6LaGG+fHaSxoexMECovzkIoADrQx
	  l73IXlUQEIoFl5jnDBBdHVvqTMEPS0118ytYVQZoQrdStuXB9Oc9gQ==
	  =azqs
</PRE>
In this example you can see that the approval 
carries a date stamp and the name of the newsgroup
in question. These, as well as the From: and
Subject: lines, and the non-blank lines of the
message itself, are used as input to the PGP
program to generate a signature. The PGP signature
is the inserted into the Approved: header, mostly
so that it won't interfere with, or be confused
with, any signature in the body of the message.
<P>
Anybody can check whether the message has been
modified in any significant way, simply by running
the PGP Moose Approval Checking program "pmcheck".
More importantly, though, the sites running the
PGP Moose Checking Daemon will be doing this
automatically for every posting to the registered
newsgroups. And, if a posting fails the checks, it
will be automatically cancelled and a notification
sent to the moderator.
<P>
This software is made freely available for just
about any purpose, but I've retained copyright so
as to keep some semblance of involvement. See the
last section of this file.

<H5>The Bits:</H5>

PGP Moose consists of a number of Bourne Shell
scripts calling standard Unix utilities and PGP.
I could have used perl more elegantly, but this
stuff is marginally more widely available.  If
there are Unix version dependencies, they should
be considered to be bugs and I'll happily attempt
to remove them.
<DL>
<DT>pmapp	usage: pmapp newsgroup [file]
<DD><BLOCKQUOTE>	
	This script takes the not-yet-posted
	article, specified either by filename or
	from standard input, and creates a
	signature for it, which is then inserted
	in the Approved: header. The article,
	ready for posting, appears on the standard
	output.
<P>
	In the configuration section at the top of
	the script, the moderator may build in the
	PGP User Id to be used for the signature,
	and the corresponding password. This is
	simply for convenience, since spammers are
	not so likely to go cracking the computer
	to get the password, and it is a
	relatively simple matter to generate a new
	user if it is, indeed, compromised. For
	the paranoid, like myself, if the password
	is not configured into the script it is
	read from the terminal instead.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<DT>pmcheck	usage: pmcheck [article]
<DD><BLOCKQUOTE>
	This script takes the article, specified
	either by filename or from standard
	input, and checks that the Approved: line
	is something it considers to be correct
	and that the article has not been
	tampered with. Pmcheck returns
	successfully if everything checks out.
	Otherwise it will return failure and
	issue one of a number of error messages,
	for example:
<PRE>
	  Usage: $0 [article]
	  Posting not approved with PGP Moose.
	  Wrong newsgroup: $6 != $GROUP.
	  Bad signature (altered or damaged file) on $FILE.
	  Signature '$SIG' on $FILE invalid for newsgroup $GROUP.
</PRE>
	Anybody can run pmcheck. It behaves
	slightly differently depending on the
	existence of a file called (by default)
	PGP_Moose_accept. This file, if it exists,
	should contain lines with a newsgroup
	name, some whitespace, and the PGP User Id
	approved by the moderator (usually made up
	specifically for this purpose). For
	example:
<PRE>
	  sci.crypt.pgpmoose       pgpmoose test &lt;<A HREF="mailto:ggr@sydney.sterling.com">ggr@sydney.sterling.com</A>&gt;
</PRE>
	If such a file exists, pmcheck is silent
	if all is well, and issues the last of the
	error messages above if everything else
	was all right but the signature was from
	the wrong person.
<P>
	Without such a file, if the signature is
	otherwise valid you will get a message
	like:
<PRE>
	  Valid signature from '$SIG'.
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE></DL>
A script is being developed by Chris Lewis (who
has more control over news stuff than I do) which
will perform the automatic cancellations. Stay
tuned. There is plenty of prior art, so this
shouldn't take too long.
<P>
Soon, when I get back from my trip in two weeks,
I will create mail server scripts that allow
moderators who are not using Unix to use these
facilities.  The first allows a moderator to mail
a PGP signed copy of the article to be posted.
The server will then verify that the moderator
sent it, and post it with a (different but
corresponding) approval. The second will accept an
article and return something that you can check
the signature on. Either way, any moderator will
still need PGP.


<H5>How Do You Register For The Service?</H5>

Ahhh, this is the hard part. After all, it would
be pretty undesirable if someone, meaning well,
took any old body's word for it that some
important moderated group should start working
this way, before the moderator was able to start
approving postings. A great way to hijack a
newsgroup.
<P>
Another possibility is that someone, having seen
what the valid signature looks like, simply
creates a whole new PGP key that happens to have
the same PGP User ID. Then they can sign and post
stuff too.
<P>
The solution to both of these problems is the
classical one for public key systems. You need
either a certifying authority or the PGP Web of
Trust. We're using the Web of Trust. If you don't
understand about PGP and the Web of Trust, go away
now and come back after you really do understand
it.
<P>
For each newsgroup that wants to utilise this
program, the moderator will have to create a
special PGP key pair (preferably 512 bits to keep
the Approved:  lines short), and sign it. They
must then establish a path of trust to someone
who is running the PGP Moose server. It will be
up to the administrator of that server to make
sure that only trusted moderators' keys ever get
into the server's keyring.
<P>
<STRONG>THERE CAN BE NO SHORTCUTS TO THIS PROCEDURE.</STRONG>
Otherwise we are all back where we started.


<H5>What If You Have Multiple Moderators?</H5>

Simple. Create one PGP key pair which can approve
posting, and share it among the moderators. You
have to exchange it securely, but by definition
you have PGP, so that shouldn't be too hard. You
can still tell which moderator approved a posting
from the Sender: line.


<H5>Possible Problems We've Forseen:</H5>

If an article is mangled e.g. by truncation, it
will fail the authentication and be cancelled.
Until it is demonstrated otherwise, this is
assumed to be a rare and minor problem. When a
cancel is issued, mail is sent to the moderator of
the group telling them, and they can tell us if it
becomes a problem.
<P>
Currently the signature produced is assumed to be
a PGP version 2.6 compatible one.
<P>
The moderated newsgroup in question must be the
first newsgroup on the Newsgroups: line; as a
corollary it is not possible at the moment for an
approved posting to multiple moderated newsgroups.
<P>
Only one PGP User Id can approve postings to a
particular group. This means that that PGP User's
private key must be shared between all of the
moderators, with all of the attendant risks.
<H5>Status:</H5>
These scripts are implemented already, or as noted
above. They are undergoing testing by Chris Lewis
&lt;<A HREF="mailto:clewis@ferret.ocunix.on.ca">clewis@ferret.ocunix.on.ca</A>&gt;, and as soon as they
have settled (within a week for sure) they will be
made available via anonymous FTP and posting to
comp.sources.misc and sci.crypt.research.


<H5>It Really Wasn't That Hard.</H5>

I wish people (other than me and Chris Lewis) had
put as much effort into doing this as they did
into clogging the Moderators' mailing list. It
wasn't hard.
<P>
But you know what was hard? What Phil Zimmermann
did creating PGP in the first place. Phil is in
serious legal hassles over PGP, and if you think
this effort saves you or your company some time or
money, I'd like you to consider donating some of
it to Phil's legal defence fund. Write to me or
Phil's lawyer Phil Dubois &lt;<A HREF="mailto:dubois@acm.org">dubois@acm.org</A>&gt;
regarding how to donate. You can do it over the
net using PGP!
<P>
Share and Enjoy!

A software glitch caused Prodigy's mail system to send 473 E-mail messages
last Friday to wrong members and to lose 4,901 messages on the Internet. 
The mail system was shut down for five hours, and Prodigy apologized to its
members for the malfunction.  (Atlanta Journal-Constitution, 11 Mar 1995, B3)

This is a short piece from *The Boston Globe*, 11 Mar 1995, by Michael
Putzel.  Apparently the Post Office is planning to deploy Iway kiosks. The
prototype appears to be a quick hack, a Silicon Graphics Indy (do I hear,
overkill?)  with a touch scree and, apparently, a web browser for getting
around. The article itself didn't tell which technology was being deployed.
This is a basic simple approach which I approve of. One of the problems was
a standard touch screen problem of having to position one's finger
correctly. More interesting was the attempt to get information from the
Social Security computer. "It seems that the agency had changed the name of
its computer without telling the Postal Service".
<P>
This fits my assumption that it is a web browser. The risk is a standard one 
of deploying a new technology while it is evolving. Many of the initial web 
pages are going to fade from the lack of interest in supporting them. This 
will disappoint those who expect a reliable mature service.
<P>
Beyond disappointing, however, it doesn't seem much of a risk and can be 
handled by setting appropriate expectations. It will be more of an issue if 
(a standard problem with the regulations limiting the Post Office) the 
technology is widely deployed.

From CIO (February 1995):
<P>
Lawrence Livermore Laboratory is working on a system called Lifeguard to
help police (and who knows who else) identify from what direction they are
being fired upon.  The system was apparently developed in response to school
shootings where it isn't always easy to spot the shooter visually.  As
described in 'Government Technology' the system uses a special sensor that
emits "ammunition-identifying" signals and attaches to a rifle like a scope.
A computer tracks incoming bullets and locates the source.  "Anybody who
shoots at you from any direction would be immediately located and subject to
return fire," says Thomas Karr, head of the Lab team.
<P>
I'll leave to everyone's imaginations the risks of hooking a computer to
the trigger of a loaded weapon and using it near civilians.

Seven Internet providers in Hong Kong were raided by the Hong Kong Royal
Police, alleged to be operating without required licence and "hacking" other
computer systems.  All computer equipment was seized, and it was reported
that police was able to look at any file on the systems - all people's
private email and even commercial documents were at risk.  Police may close
down and check any Internet provider out again at anytime, and companies'
information is at risk if someone in police sells the information secretly.

Funny creature this Internet, and the people associated with it, especially
"journalist-researchers", as they call themselves.  Adding to the unusual
mixture recently here in Scandanavia have been the Scientologists and the
Police.  It would be funny to follow the intrigues if they were fiction, but
these are all too real:

<H4>Case  #1</H4>
  A Swedish journalist-researcher "reveals" that an Anonymous Finnish
Internet server has been spreading pedophiliac pictures.  It sounds like a
big Issue, but it is not true.
  The addresses within the pedophiliac-picture files were in fact forged,
and they didn't come via the anonymous Finnish server (owned by Johan
Helsingius).  This part of the news wasn't much publicized.
  It seems that the real pedophiliac-picture distributing server was a
British one.

<H4>Case #2</H4>

  Finnish Police receive a request from U.S. law enforcement authorities to
confiscate (real) user information from the Finnish Anonymous Server.  About
the same time, Scientologists claimed that someone had broken into their
system and was revealing "highly confidential" information via the Finnish
anonymous server.  Well, of course, the Finnish Police carried out a house
search and seizure to obtain real user information from the anonymous
server.  Then they promptly gave the information to the Scientologists!!!
<P>
Lessons, if any:
<UL>
<LI>Negative stories receive more press coverage than positive ones.

<LI>Corrections are rarely seen by the reader, especially readers in other
countries.

<LI>People, even Police officers, will act as if "The Party Which Brings Up
Some Claim/Issue" has been harmed and must be right.  They cannot see, that
some issues might be brought up under "legitimate cover" to serve other
purposes. This "legitimate" cover should be verified etc...and during this
process the Police shouldn't give information to the complainant.
</UL>
Other thoughts:
<P>
Can this affect us?  Most definitely.  What if the Scientologists had made
the same charges against our banking system and had asked the Police to
reveal user information in our files?  And what if we had asked the police
to determine who has tried to break into our systems from this or that
address?  Should we have a right to obtain this information directly from
the Police (similar to your Procter and Gamble case several years ago)?

&gt;Has anybody heard of consumer electronic stuff being recalled because<BR>
&gt;of software problems yet?
<P>
Typically they tend not to be acknowledged or recalled, as it would be
prohibitively expensive for the manufacturers, and they are used to walking
all over the consumers.  A couple of examples:
<P>
An older Sony 5-disk CD player had a shuffle play with a poor random number
generator and no memory of what songs it had played, it merely chose a disk
at 'random' and then a track at 'random' from that disk.  It would, for
instance, play disk 3 track 5, disk 2 track 8, disk 3 track 5, "rinse,
lather, repeat".  The "solution" was to ignore that function and (5 years
later) check carefully that Sony had fixed that bug before buying a new
model.
<P>
Volkswagen had a bug in their Digifant-II electronic engine management
computer for a couple of _years_ that caused cold-start problems on hot
days.  It appeared that the computer was reading the engine temperature
sensor as "hot", so it didn't "put on the choke".  I actually had the
service manager at a VW dealer tell me that I had to keep my foot on the gas
of a fuel injected, computer controlled car for a minute or two after
starting to keep it from stalling[!].  The first-level fix was, after a year
and a half of so called 'service', replacing the computer.  The second-level
fix was switching car brands.  8*|
<P>
In both cases, the manufacturer was highly motivated to ignore the problem.
I would guess that a fair amount of the development of the CD player was
writing the software, and producing new CPUs, recalling the players, and
repairing them would have cost Sony more than developing a new player from
scratch and giving new ones to folks who complained about the old ones.
Volkswagen would have spent a small fortune recalling cars and putting new
computers in each, if only in the currency of opportunity cost (what they
spent in customer good will isn't really a subject for Risks).
<P>
When a software company produces a new product, they test it and run it thru
beta testing and such to ensure that it works properly.  When a hardware
company puts software into their product, they may not understand the
software, and take the developers word for it's quality.

SATAN software (an acronym standing for Security Administrator Tool for
Analyzing Networks), which was developed by Dan Farmer of Silicon Graphics
to scan thousands of host computers on the Internet for security
vulnerabilities, was stolen by Kevin Mitnick, the computer cracker who was
arrested last month by the FBI and is now under indictment for 23 counts of
fraud involving computer use.  Mitnick broke into Farmer's account on the
WELL, a California Internet service provider.  Farmer says he has no way of
knowing whether Mitnick shared copies of SATAN over the Internet.  (The New
York Times, 12 Mar 1995, [City edition?] Sec.3, p.11; 11 Mar 1995, p.30)

Given the prevalence of Unix (aka broken) mail forwarders out there that
believe any occurrence of "From" at the beginning of a line can be "wedged" as
&gt;From (did that arrive at your location as &gt;From?  It left here unwedged.),
we are likely to soon have a new risk on the net: The risk of automatic
cancellation of all messages that happen to have the wrong four characters
at the beginning of some line.  People forwarding messages complete with
headers -- beware!  Any "From:" lines you include are likely Moosebait!
<P>
Oh, yes, there are also some mail forwarders out there that will change any
line consisting only of a single "." to one containing "..".  There are no
doubt some that will make the reverse substitution.  There also appear to be
gateways around that will replace empty lines with lines containing a single
space, as well as gateways that do strange and wondrous things with spaces
at the end of lines.  Finally, there appear to be an increasing number of
programs that, under certain unclear conditions, use MIME's BASE64 encoding
in the midst of otherwise simple ASCII text - you'll see things like =20 at
the end of a line.
<P>
I suppose the underlying idea here is fine, but unfortunately an attempt to
build such a thing on top of the very chaotic and unpredictable world of
today's mail systems is to impose many non-obvious risks on users.

	 Errors in financial calculations are not new.  When I worked
	 at Autex, Inc.  in the early 70's I wrote a program to
	 calculate bond tables.  I was told that my calculations,
	 right or wrong, had to agree with a certain book that all the
	 traders used.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Such problems are even older.  Fred Brooks tells a similar story from the
mid-1950's.  He was assigned to write a program to do billing for petroleum
delivered through a pipeline.  Now -- the actual volume occupied by a given
mass of petroleum varies with the temperature, and there was a standard book
listing the correction factor for each grade and temperature.  To comply
with various contractual and legal provisions, the program had to produce
the same answers.  Today, we might use an array; back then, there wasn't
enough memory to hold such a large table.
<P>
No problem, right -- the expansion had to be a matter of simple
physical laws, so they could just calculate it.  It turned out to be a
simple equation.  But whoever had drawn up the table in the first place
hadn't rounded consistently -- and the program *had* to match.
<P>
They ended up doing the calculation, and storing a compressed table giving
the difference between the calculated values and the legal ones.  Never mind
reality -- custom ruled.

Some of the replies to my article on the source of semantic content indicate
that I have not made myself clear.  I did not mean to suggest that we should
sit back and do nothing, secure in the knowledge that there are
technological tricks that can be played to circumvent the law.  I am well
aware that once the witch hunt for net.pornographers begins in earnest that
logic will provide precious little protection, and the "I only sent random
bits" defense probably won't hold up in court.  That should scare the pants
off you; if it doesn't then you haven't understood what I am trying to say.
<P>
At the end of my original article I wrote:
<P>
"...transmitting random bit streams may soon become a crime."
<P>
I meant this to be taken quite literally.  Once there is precedent for
convicting someone for transmitting porn using the xor trick, then anyone
who sends out a random bit stream for *any* reason can (and probably will)
be convicted for transmitting porn.  Here's one possible scenario:
<P>
Let's say that A sends B a random bit stream F1 for some legitimate reason.
(For example, he might be a cryptography researcher sending sample output
from his latest cryptanalytically secure random number generator for
analysis, or he may be a college student who just wants to thumb his nose at
the establishment.)  If B wants to transmit a pornographic image P and blame
it on A, he uses F1 to encode P into F2, and puts F2 onto his public ftp
server.  To be extra sure, he changes the last-modified date to a week or so
ago.  B then calls the authorities (or maybe B *is* the authorities) and
says, "I have just discovered that A has used my publicly available random
file F2 to encode a pornographic image."
<P>
Here's another scenario.  Let's say that A uses the xor trick to transmit a
legitimate file to B in the form of two files F1 and F2.  B encodes P with
F1 and replaces the content of the legitimate F2 with the result. He then
calls the authorities and says, "A sent me these two files, and when I put
them together the result was P."
<P>
More complex scenarios are possible by observing that the xor trick is not
limited to two files.  An image can be one-time-padded an arbitrary number
of times, resulting in an arbitrarily large number of files that must be
combined to generate the image.  Any combination of these files can be used
as a key to encode some other image.  If freedom-loving people start to use
the xor trick a lot, then there could be a tremendous profusion of random
files out there that can be combined in an enormous number of ways to
produce an enormous number of images.  You might even have pornography on
your disk and not even be aware of it.  In fact, *any* file is just a
one-time-pad encoding away from being a pornographic image.  Your copy of
Microsoft Word has obscenities in it if you just know how to decode them.
<P>
This is not at all the same as an undeveloped image on film.  In the case of
film it is clear that the information content is in the film and not in the
developing process.  In the case of an encoded file there is literally no
way to tell which is film and which is developer, which is encoded image and
which is key.  As with many things in the cyberworld, fundamental
assumptions about the Way Things Work break down here.

IMHO:
<P>
Anyone with the least knowledge of EE (or a subscription to 2600 or Phrack)
ought to be able to eavesdrop on cellular telephone conversations without
resorting to industrial espionage. It's not like these conversations
are encrypted as a matter of course. I suppose it's possible that
the Pakistani cellular network uses some form of encryption that requires
Motorola technology to solve, but I doubt it. In any event, *our*
cellular phone network sends conversations in the clear unless CPE
does something special about it.
<P>
Anyone who thinks radio transmissions of any sort are secure (at least those
which don't employ reasonable crypto protocols) deserves whatever happens to
them....
<P>
I assume that US diplomatic and intelligence personnel abroad do use some
form of encryption in their transmissions, but I also assume (hope) that
they don't rely on it for really sensitive information.
<P>
As far as terrorist action goes, unless and until government turns into a
1984-ish police state, terrorists and assassins will always be able to carry
out attacks. The freedom of information and action in a democratic society
more or less guarantees it.

Regarding Pakistan's requirement that Motorola provide cellular
eavesdropping technology:
<P>
&gt;1) Can this eavesdropping hardware work in the United States?
<P>
Probably not. Most likely the system is the new global spread spectrum
standard, which the US doesn't use and probably won't. That's the good news.
<P>
The bad news is that it isn't needed. Anyone can buy a scanner and modify
it, or buy a downconverter for it, and then listen in on any analog cellular
system today! This is illegal in the US but unenforceable. Recently it has
become illegal to manufacture or import a scanner that is "easily
modifiable" for cellular reception. However, there are millions of scanners
all ready in circulation that can receive cellular or be easily modified for
this purpose.  Furthermore, many scanners pick up cellular as an image
frequency, which means they can be used for cellular monitoring simply by
entering a frequency typically 21.4 MHz below the frequency to be monitored.
<P>
Newer US systems will be digital (spread spectrum or TDMA) and encryptable,
and thus should be relatively secure against foreign monitoring. However, it
is possible that the US Government will force suppliers to make monitoring
equipment and encryption keys available to them, but the US Government also
wants those crypto keys unavailable to anyone else.

&gt;&gt; 1) Can this eavesdropping hardware work in the United States? 
<P>
The cellular phone system in the US uses FM modulation very similar to that
in your radio.  Scanners which could scan cellular frequencies (along with
amateur bands, police, fire, etc) were once available at such underground
shops as Radio Shack.  Scanning cellular was made illegal, so these devices
dried up, to be replaced with scanners which could scan all the frequences
above except cellular.  These scanners could, with the clip of a wire or the
press of a "secret" button combination, begin to scan cellular frequencies,
even though this activity is illegal.  Early in 1994, equipment which could
be "illegally modified" to scan cellular was made illegal (that is, the FCC
would no longer license it).  Older radios (of which I own two) were
grandfathered.
<P>
There are two RISKS here.  One, the US government is deluded enough to
believe that these laws prevent cellular scanning.  Two, the public is not
educated enough to know that this sort of scanning is so easy,
<P>
Oh, and if all of the above isn't enough, every cellphone I've played with
has a diagnostic/repair mode which scans cellular frequences.  There is a
story of a demo for congress, where someone (who had to be granted immunity
for this demo!) took a brand new cellphone out of a box, plugged it in,
pushed a few buttons, and 30 seconds after breaking the shrink wrap, scanned
through some calls to show how easy it was.
<P>
The third risk: Our government is as scared as Pakistan's about widespread
encryption.  This issue has been covered in RISKS and Privacy Digest before.

Why do you expect Pakistan to act different from the USA? Think of Clipper

Maybe the USA does a better job in covering up and might (or is expected to)

The risk is to use communication technology that can be eavesdropped. Even

Well... I trust that this is simply a case of a missing thought that seemed
obvious to the speaker, namely, that the shooter would be subject to return
fire by the human, if there were a clean shot and the situation otherwise
justified returning fire.
<P>
The description is interesting, though.  Makes it sound as though some kind
of active millimeter-wave radar or sonar-like device were in use, as opposed
to passive triangulation of the sound of gunfire.  This presents intriguing
technical problems.  The bullets of common small arms are roughly... oh, for
these back of the envelope purposes let's say they're the size of a pencil
eraser.  They move anywhere from about 800 feet per second (the .45
automatic pistol) to as much as 3000+ fps (the AR-15).  They are almost
always, but not neces- sarily, made of metal.
<P>
Now, consider that they are fired at ranges from 7 yards (which the
conventional wisdom says is the maximum range of most civilian shootings) to
contact.  An exception might be a drive-by shooting at several tens of
yards, or an urban sniper situation at perhaps a couple of hundred yards.
We can probably disregard these because of transmitted power and, in the
case of a sonar, timing considerations.  So this James Bond gizmo might have
as little as .007 seconds in which to do the job.  In an urban environment
it also has to gate out echoes.  And unless it's a slick Doppler job, it has
to get two readings.  Finally, unless it also catches the sound of the
gunshot, it *still* doesn't give you the range, just an idea of where to
look, based on what you hope is the trajectory.
<P>
Meanwhile, in case solving realtime problems in three dimensions isn't fun
enough, the shooter might well have moved and/or hidden his weapon.
<P>
This could well be quite a tactical asset to a police team.  Maybe even an
individual officer, in giving him a clue as to where to look.  It certainly
isn't a cure-all, and, especially in the case of a lone officer, it's easy
to imagine RISKS associated with getting into a "heads-down mode" to run a
technological crutch and forgetting the tactical situation.

   If, as was mentioned in the prior edition, the Finish police handed all
the anonymous ID database to the Scientologists, many of the people who
have used the anonymizing service may RISK exposure to some form of
blackmail attempts.  One has only to look at some of the articles posted
in the Scientology forum on the Usenet to see what they are often accused
of.
<P>
   A few thoughts from a course I once attended at IBM on industrial 
espionage:
<P>
   The typical means of gaining control used by some intelligence services,
(including private ones,) and often cults, is to make a series of minor but
unethical or illegal requests which, once filled, would place the victim
greater and greater conflict with their employers, the law, and/or society
if their deeds were to be made public.  The goal is to deny the victim
access to legal and societal services.  (And in the case of cults, outside
moral support.) Eventually, the victim has no choice but to comply with even
the most hienious of operations, or risk long term incarceration, or worse.
<P>
   One way to avoid this scenario, is to call the would-be blackmailer's
bluff and say "No" at the outset.  A better way, would be to seek out and
cooperate with an appropriate company security or law enforcement agency,
such as the FBI, so as to help them turn the blackmail operation into a
sting. The would-be victim is usually given immunity from prosecution.  In
most cases, the typical minor transgressions spoken of via an anonymizing
service user would be laughed at by the police; but the concept of
blackmail on an organized scale should be taken quite seriously by an
organization such as the FBI. 
<P>
   One should also note, that if the FBI, CIA, etc. are not watching the
anonymizing services, they are sadly in remiss of their duties. It does not
take much to crack such a service!  Thus one may suspect that voluntary
cooperation at the outset might be to one's benefit in most cases; and in
some cases, being blackmailed by a more nefarious organization may actually
turn out to be a relatively opportune event.
<P>
   If the Scientologists begin to fear that many of their potential victims
would turn to the FBI, they may become more reluctant to pursue potential
victims.  Perhaps we should push this concept a bit on the net and

Viral Morality: A Call for Discussion
 <P>
"Computer ethics" has been an ongoing study in the technical world.  On the one
hand is the study of the ethical, moral, or proper use of computers.  On the
other, is the study of computer crime and vandalism.  Lately, I have noted a
rather desperate interest in courses or training in computer ethics, as well as
an increase in the frequency and depth of discussions regarding the ethics of
virus writing.  I would like to address this latter topic, specifically.
 <P>
One problem with current discussions and literature regarding the ethics of
virus writing and distribution is the lack of dialogue between two opposing
camps.  This paper is not intended to present any final answer, nor to add to
the literature in the field, but to open the field for comment.  My purpose in
writing this is to provide an initial overview and to elicit feedback from any
and all concerned with the topic.
 <P>
For those of traditional moral stance, the current situation is discouraging. 
Peter Denning's "Computers Under Attack" (cf. BKDENING.RVW) has a very thorough
survey of the field, but it provides little in the way of answers or hope. 
Deborah Johnson's work "Computer Ethics" (cf. BKCMPETH.RVW) is pre-eminent in
the field, but serves only to clarify the problem.  Sarah Gordon's interviews
with computer students show responses typical of almost all such studies.  The
base attitude appears to be, "If I find it interesting, and I can do it, why do
you say I shouldn't?"
 <P>
The proponents of security-breaking activities often question the traditional
ethical position by asking, "Where's the harm?"  This query is directly
relevant to discussions of the morality of virus writing.
 <P>
I should begin by defining two generally opposed groups in this area.  First is
the "antivirus", or "AV", research community.  Many, though not all, of the
members of this group would be involved in producing antiviral software.  All
would study viral programs with a view to eliminating viral programs in the
normal computing environment.  They take a rather paranoid, and almost
obsessive, position with regard to the sharing and distribution of viral code. 
(They would rejoin this last by pointing out that it isn't paranoia if someone
is *really* out to get you.)
 <P>
The AV community is not really opposed to the writing of viral programs.  It is
seen as a trivial, and therefore pointless, exercise; but not necessarily evil,
in itself.  The communication of viral program code is also a normal
professional and academic activity, as long as it is limited, done for a stated
purpose, and the recipients are known.  It is the unregulated exchange of virus
code and source, providing open access to anyone with a computer and a modem,
that is upsetting.  The opposing group is therefore described as the virus
exchange community, or "vx" for short.  (This designation was first used by
Sarah Gordon.)  For the purposes of this paper, therefore, references to "virus
writing", "virus exchange" or "vx" will mean the uncontrolled or unregulated
exchange or provision of access to virus source and object code.
 <P>
(This does not necessarily mean deliberate distribution of infected programs by
such means as infecting a legitimate program and then posting it, without
warning, to a bulletin board system.  "Trojanizing" of normal software or
malicious invasion of systems is certainly happening in some areas, but it is
not needed in the current computing situation.  While there is debate over the
relative contribution of "natural spread" and virus exchange to the current
virus problem, it is known that code made available only as openly published
material does eventually infect machines in the normal computing environment. 
The term vx does not, therefore, require any imputation of sinister motives or
hidden activity for the purposes of this discussion.)
 <P>
There are some grey areas between these two poles.  Some people have both
written antiviral software *and* contributed to viral spread.  Given, however,
that one could expect a continuum of opinion, those in the middle are
remarkably few.  Either you are for virus exchange, or against it.
 <P>
One other, separate, group should be noted.  Viral programs are often cited as
an example of "artificial life", and the research community in that field, both
professional and amateur, have a legitimate interest in viral programming. 
Work in the a-life field, however, does not justify unregulated code and source
exchange.  For one thing, current viral programs "in the wild" (those which are
to be found in normal home and business computers, as opposed to those which
exist only in a research or laboratory environment) have only the most tenuous
claim to artificial life.  Common viral programs are simplistic snippets of
code without anything like the complexity of the simplest known natural life
forms.  In addition, those who really do work in the artificial life area will
be well aware that it does carry possible dangers, and that research should be
subject to controls similar to those imposed on biological and genetic study.
 <P>
The most common argument for virus-writing tends to boil down to, "You can't
stop me."  Many promote virus writing on the grounds of freedom of speech, a
rather curious position in light of the incoherence of the arguments.  (The
most vocal of these tend to be Americans, who frequently cite "First Amendment
Rights".  This refers to the first amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which
Americans tend to see as some universal law, rather than an arbitrary political
document, however desirable.)
 <P>
Rights, though, carry with them a weight of responsibility.  As is often
quoted, your "right" to swing your fist ceases at the end of my nose.  You have
a "right" to free speech--so long as you are responsible and do not perpetrate
fraud.  You have a "right" to study whatever you like--so long  as you are
responsible enough not to carry out experiments in poison with human subjects. 
No PC is an island--at least, not where viral programs are concerned. 
Therefore, your "right" to study, write and distribute viral programs carries
the responsibility to ensure that your creations do not--ever--run on machines
where they are not authorized.
 <P>
One of the most confusing aspects of the "exchange/no exchange" debate is the
concept of the "good" virus.  There is nothing inherently evil in the concept
of reproduction.  (Dangerous, yes.)  In fact, the very earliest experiment with
self-reproducing programs was the Xerox Worm of Shoch and Hupp.  This was
designed to spawn "segments" of the central program on other machines in the
network, thus bringing the power of many processors to bear on a single
problem.  Thus, in theory, viral programming could represent the same level of
advanced technology in software that parallel processing represents in
hardware.
 <P>
That's the theory.  And it is promoted by no less eminent a researcher than Dr.
Fred Cohen, who did seminal work on the security-breaking class of viral
programs in a thesis, in 1984, and dissertation, in 1986.  Unfortunately, the
theory founders on some rather hard facts.
 <P>
There are three questions to ask of a new, inherently dangerous, technology.
Has it a useful application?  Can it fulfill that application better than
current technologies?  And, can the danger, either inherently, or
effectively, be controlled?
 <P>
To date, no one has answered those three questions.  While a variety of uses
have been proposed for viral programs, there are none which are not effectively
being done by other means.  No viral programs have, indeed, been seen to be as
effective as normal systems.  Operating system upgrades could not guarantee
universal coverage.  Network management tasks could not promise reliable
feedback.  Automated utilities would confuse novice level users, who never run
utilities anyway.  The most useful function is still that proposed by Shoch and
Hupp--and their programs were not, strictly speaking, viral.
 <P>
(Vesselin Bontchev's examination of this question is the most detailed to date,
and is required reading for all who want to join the debate.  His proposals,
while demonstrating good ideas for safety and control, are still primarily an
advanced automated distribution system.  The necessity for viral functions in
this regard is still unproven.)
 <P>
Those in the vx camp will point to two current viral programs which, they say,
do have useful functions.  One of these programs produces compressed executable
files, thus saving disk space, while the other performs encryption on files. 
However, both of these functions are provided by other programs--from which,
indeed, code was stolen for those two "good" virals.  Neither of the viral
programs are as easy to use or control as the original programs, and both have
bugs which must place them firmly in the malware grouping, for nuisance value,
if nothing else.
 <P>
Currently, therefore, the utility of viral programs is very much unproven. 
This would, though, mean only that they are neutral, were it not for the lack
of any demonstrable control.  Methods of control have been discussed primarily
by Fred Cohen, but even he remains unconvincing.  The mechanisms generally are
limited to environmental checks which can either fail, or be easily cut out of
the program.  Some have proposed "hunter" virals, to go after programs which
"turn rogue", but a program which is corrupted will behave in unpredictable
ways and a hunter program would likely consume a lot of resources, fail, or
(most likely) both.
 <P>
(Cohen frequently cites viral "programs which have been running since 1986 with
no ill effects" and speaks of a VCE (viral computing environment).  There are
two points to be noted here.  One is that Cohen has not yet described his viral
programs in anything like the detail he put into his earlier work, so there can
be no independent assessment of his claims.  The second point is that the very
term, VCE, implies that a viral computing environment is substantially
different, and should be kept separate, from the "normal" computing environment
as it is currently known.  A VCE may very well be a powerful entity, but it is
still an unknown and unproven concept.)
 <P>
Computer viral programs have an inherent danger:  that of reproduction and
spread.  If you study explosives, and pass along that knowledge, you also have
to pass along the materials before there is any risk of a blast.  Even then,
the materials do not multiply themselves:  when exhausted, another supply must
be found.  The same is *not* true of viral programs.  These entities are
*designed* to reproduce.  And, unlike the study of dangerous animals, or even
germ warfare, viral programs are built to reproduce, multiply and spread
without the aid of a skilled, or even aware, operator.  If you are careless
with a deadly animal or weapon, it is still only a single danger in a localized
area.  If you are careless with a computer virus, it can spread world-wide.
 <P>
We do not use computers because they are smart.  Computers *aren't* smart. 
Sometimes we use them because they can do calculations very quickly, but even
this is only a special case of the real value of computers.  Computers always
do the same thing in the same way.  They are repeatable.  They are, in this
manner, reliable.  Even a computer error can be useful to us--so long as it
always happens the same way.
 <P>
Consider, then, the computer virus.  In order to reproduce without the informed
assistance of the user, the virus must be, in the computer sense, transparent. 
It must operate without alerting the operator, or interfering with the
operator's interaction with the computer.  If the virus even posts a notice
("Hi! I am infecting object X!"), it has a nuisance value and is, therefore,
not good.  (Vesselin Bontchev notes that even such a notice, by possibly
delaying a process, may have grave consequences far beyond annoyance.)
 <P>
If, however, the virus does *not* notify the operator, then the operator is not
aware of some additional code in the machine.  This extra code will have an
unknown, and inherently unknowable, effect on the computer.  The operations of
the computer are, therefore, no longer repeatable.  This is a Bad Thing (TM).
 <P>
Some will protest that I have overblown the danger of both the notification
messages and the possibility of conflicts.  The point that I am trying to make
is that you cannot predict the harm which may arise from interference either
with the operator or the programs.  Software is digital, and is subject to
catastrophic collapse without prior warning.  For those without a background in
computer risk assessment, an excellent overview for the non-professional is
found in Lauren Wiener's "Digital Woes" (cf. BKDGTLWO.RVW).  An intriguing
compilation of the types of things that can go wrong is to be found in Peter
Neumann's "Computer Related Risks" (cf. BKCMRLRS.RVW).  At the very least, as
Sarah Gordon points out, the virus is an autonomous agent, making decisions and
carrying out activities according to it's own internal constructs and the
intention of its programmer.  This is very likely not in correspondence with
your own intention, and is therefore an invasion of privacy.
 <P>
A number of virus writers will object that their creations simply are not
harmful.  Not only is it impossible to guarantee that your virus will not
conflict with existing systems, you also cannot guarantee that a given system
will not conflict with your virus.  Almost all file infecting viral programs
will interfere with applications which have an internal integrity checksum or a
non-standard loader, and will cause those applications to fail.  (An example of
this is that Windows programs infected with DOS viral programs always fail to
load.)  The "Ohio" virus (a prior version of Den Zuk) was not intended to carry
any destructive payload, but an unusual interaction with a certain network
operating system caused fatal disk corruption.  Since both Ohio and Den Zuk are
examples of the often proposed "virus hunter virus", it should be clear that
the concept of using a viral program to hunt down and disinfect other viral
programs is not a good one.
 <P>
Historically, and statistically, virus exchange people have been careless and
incompetent programmers.  Remember that we are talking vx, here, and those
viral programs which have been released into the wild.  There may be, carefully
hidden in the desk of a virus writer, the "perfect" and harmless virus.  If so,
we haven't seen it yet.  The majority have obvious bugs, sloppy coding and
derivative programming.  Less than one percent are interesting for *any*
reason; only a handful have unique styles of algorithms.  And even these last
have programming pathologies.
 <P>
There are two other reasons often given to justify virus exchange.  The first
is generally described as experimentation and education.  The second is
described as antiviral research, or, more commonly, assessment of antiviral
programs.  These arguments *do* have some validity, and should be examined. 
Ultimately, though, the reality fails to support the claim.
 <P>
The call for experimentation is somewhat tied to the argument for a "good"
virus.  Current viral technology may be crude and ridiculous, but how can it be
improved if there isn't any work or sharing of results?  Quite true.  The vx
community, however, have obviously not read or noted any programming journals
or texts.  Discussions of programming and algorithms are supported by well-
annotated code fragments.  You don't present a whole program to discuss a
specific function any more than you send an entire car with a manual on auto
repair.  You certainly don't use encoded or "DEBUG script" object code:  that
has no explanatory value at all.
 <P>
And I have yet to see, in the vx materials, any discussion of legitimate and
positive uses for viral technology, any discussion of control technology, or
any discussion directed at ensuring that viral programs do not create
conflicts.
 <P>
In regard to education, it is true that a study of viral programs is related to
a knowledge of operating system internals, as well as assembly language
programming.  However, viral study *requires* such knowledge, rather than
providing it.  Giving someone a virus and expecting them to learn from it is
akin to "teaching" a surgeon by handing him a scalpel and pointing at a
patient.  Even the vx "old guard" are beginning to realize this.  Viral
programs use normal computer functions.  If you understand computers, a virus
is trivial.  If you don't, well ...
 <P>
As far as virus exchange tutorials go, well, let me put it this way.  I am a
teacher.  Many of you will also know that I review technical books on a daily
basis.  Some are great, enough are good, many are bad and some are just plain
awful.  Only a few are worse, in terms of tutorial effectiveness, than vx
"zines" (electronic periodicals).
 <P>
Recently, someone who makes his living pushing virus source code promoted a
collection of viral programs by suggesting you could test antiviral programs
with it.  This, superficially, sounds like a good idea--if you don't know what
*real* software testing is like.  What do we know about the quality of this
"zoo" (set of virus samples)?  What do we know about the structure,
organization, documentation and so forth?  How many duplicates are there?  Of
course, we *do* want duplicates in some cases; we want every possible variation
on polymorphs.  (For Tremor, that works out to almost six billion files.)  But
then, this collection was on a CD-ROM.  What a pity.  The most successful viral
programs are boot sector infectors, and you need to have real, infected disks
to truly test for them.  At a minimum, you'd want all seven "common" disk
formats, in both system and non-system versions.  That's fourteen disks--for
*each* BSI.
 <P>
For all the length of this piece, it is still only an overview.  And, for all
it's length, it probably hasn't convinced anyone.  Ethics education (it used to
be called "values education"), in whatever form and however presented, has very
little to show that it works.  There are various theories and models of moral
training, the most sophisticated probably being Lawrence Kohlberg's "Moral
Development" schema.  All, though, basically boil down to sitting around
talking about ethical dilemmas.  They may develop debating skills and
rhetorical sophistry, but there is no evidence to suggest that any of these
programs leads to any significant change in behaviour.
 <P>
While Kohlberg's model of moral development has the most detailed construction,
its utility is questionable.  His system is not so much one of values education
as of values measurement.  It is, therefore, a guideline for evaluating other
ethical training methods rather than a means of instruction and change.  Moral
development is a six stage structure, assessing the type of reasoning which
goes into ethical choices.  The stages range from "fear of punishment" to
"internal ethical principles".  There is great difficulty, however, in
determining the "stage" of a given individual.  Most ethical discussions will
be judged as having reasoning at all of stages three, four and five.  This
entire document, for example, could be dismissed as being level one reasoning
since it mentions the possibility of the danger of virus distribution and could
therefore be seen as a "fear of punishment" (negative consequences) on my part. 
On the other hand, most of Kohlberg's proponents dismiss level six, since even
a psychopath could be said to be acting from internal principles.  Kohlberg,
himself, has stated that he does not know if anyone consistently acts from
stage six reasoning.
 <P>
Probably the major reason for this is that modern society has no fundamental
moral foundation.  The most widely cited (and Johnson gives an excellent
critique of it) is utilitarianism--"the greatest good for the greatest number". 
Leaving aside the difficulties of assessing such a measure, utilitarianism,
along with all the other modern "humanistic" philosophies, has nothing to
support itself.  Why is "the greatest good for the greatest number" to be
chosen over "what *I* want"?  An alternative is deontology; ethical principles
derived from the concept of duty.  (Ironically, this philosophy, while arguably
superior to utilitarianism, is limited to Kohlberg's stage four almost by
definition.)  Again, however, there is no underpinning to the concept of duty,
itself.
 <P>
Ironically, the much maligned "Judeo-Christian Ethic" did have such a
foundation for moral standards--God.  The theistic universe may yet have the
last laugh over the mechanical universe of B. F. Skinner's "Beyond Freedom and
Dignity".  Maybe Jesus *is* the answer--or there may be no answer.

"BC man sentenced for ATM scam"
<P>

     PORT HARDY, B.C. (CP)  --  A Vancouver Island man who used his health 
card to steal $100,000 from a bank machine has been given a year in jail.  
Richard Lee Mose, 22, of Port Alice, B.C., was found guilty of theft in 
Campbell River court.  A Bank of Nova Scotia official said a processing 
problem allowed Mose to use a non-bank card on an automatic teller.  With 
his health-care card, Mose completed several transactions over several 
hours and got $109,000 dollars.  But the bank machine recorded the 
information stored on the health card, and police traced it back to Mose.

The BBC news at 08.30 reported a slight problem which occurred on the
morning of 15 Mar 1995 with the ultra high-tech, packed full of software
and therefore utterly wonderful Airbus A340.
<P>
Apparently on the final part of its approach to Gatwick, both the pilots
screens went blank, to be replaced by a polite little message saying "Please
wait ...".  Somewhat unnerved, the pilots requested that the plane turn
left, but it turned right instead.  They then tried to get it to adopt a 3
degree approach to the runway, but it chose a 9 degree plummet instead.  At
this point, from the report, they appeared to gain manual control and landed
safely.  It is not clear who will pick up the dry-cleaning bill.
<P>
Vis a vis this sort of thing, I was at a talk recently, given by the CAA (UK
Civil Aviation Authority), at which it was stated that in the past
generation of civil aircraft, most of the software problems were reported in
the Flight Management System.  Not surprisingly, this was the most complex
part of the aircraft software system.  Not any more it isn't.  During the
talk, it was also admitted that the newer generation of aircraft such as the
A340, other software systems including active systems were "at least as
complicated".  So what next ?
<P>
 I suppose it follows on nicely from the story in the October 1994 Risks
whereby a Japanese Air Force T-4 jet trainer ejected one of its pilots.
Perhaps it didn't like him.  :-)

One thing that's bugged the hell out of me for several years is the 
failure of many people giving instructions on finding net resources 
to do so in a generic manner.  Here's a great example:
<BLOCKQUOTE><OL>
       <LI>  Get into the WWW.
       <LI>  Enter the letter G so you can enter the address for the
           test site.
       <LI>  At the prompt, enter the following:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
               <A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/jembin/mb.pl">http://sunsite.unc.edu/jembin/mb.pl</A>
</BLOCKQUOTE></OL></BLOCKQUOTE>
This was from an announcement off of the Net Happenings list. Anyone 
following these instructions will get nowhere unless they are using lynx 
(unless there's another browser that uses the same keystrokes to specify 
a URL, which I doubt.)  The first item implies that the instructions are 
generic, for whatever means one uses to browse WWW sites (and, 
incidentally, indicate a fundamental misunderstanding of the technology, 
since the WWW is not a "thing" that one "gets into", but is a method, a 
process, a standard.
<P>
All the author had to do was put:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
       URL:<A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/jembin/mb.pl">http://sunsite.unc.edu/jembin/mb.pl</A>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
At any rate, the application-dependent specificity of the instructions, 
though not a problem for anyone that's been using Internet tools for 
very long, is potentially very confusing and frustrating to less 
experienced users.  And these users exist in ever greater numbers, as 
systems like AOL and Delphi become increasingly Internetly.  I don't 
mean to single out AOL for any more maligning, but as a forum sysop 
there besides my other online services duties, I can say from firsthand 
experience that the technical skill level of AOL users is, on average, 
staggerly lower that that of the typical shell account user, or almost 
anyone else online for that matter.
<P>
Typical questions I receive from AOL users are: "What happened?"  "How do 
I read this file?"  "If I want to download an ASCII file do I have to use 
the ASCII protocol, or can I use ZModem?"  "What do I join?"  "Help!"  
"What is a 'GIF graphics viewer'?"  Those aren't snippets. Those are 
entire message bodies.  Such people, confronted with the site instructions 
I quoted from Net Happenings, are never going to reach the site in question, 
will probably pound people like me with more questions like the above 
example in an effort to figure out what to do, and may eventually give 
up in disgust (a few might actually RTFM and get a clue, but not 
everyone is a born geek.)
<P>
So, there are two RISKS to keep in mind here:
<OL>
<LI> If you use platform-specific instructions, you are doing other readers a
disservice, and should at very least note that they are platform-specific
(or application-specific, or whatever, as apropos).  Better yet, just use
generic instructions that anyone can use.

<LI>If you need help with something, but don't *include enough information*
for them to actually help you, you're unlikely to get a useful response.
Include info such as: what kind of system you have, what it's relevant
configuration is, what went wrong in detail, what all the items (files,
whatever) are specifically that you are referring to, etc.

The Manchurian Printer, (C) 1995, Simson L. Garfinkel<BR>
[The Boston Sunday Globe, March 5, 1995, Focus Section, Page 83]<P>
<P>
Simson L. Garfinkel
<P>
Early this month, Hewlett-Packard announced a recall of 10,000 HP OfficeJet
printer fax copiers. The printer's power supplies may have a manufacturing
defect that could pose an electrical shock hazard. HP says that it
discovered the problem with its printers during routine testing; HP was
lucky: printers can be very dangerous devices. A typical laser printer, for
example, can draw hundreds of watts of power, generate internal temperatures
high enough to burn a wayward human hand, and even, under the right
circumstances, start a fire.
<P>
Most manufacturers, of course, try to design their printers to minimize such
risks. Increasingly, however, there is a chance that companies might
intentionally design life-threatening flaws into their products so that the
flaws can be exploited at a later time. These fatal flaws might be
intentionally built into equipment manufactured overseas, as a kind of
"insurance policy" in the event of a war between that foreign country and
the United States. The flaws might form the basis for a new kind of
corporate warfare. Or the flaws might be hidden by disgruntled employees
contemplating extortion or revenge.
<P>
Indeed, U.S. military planners are increasingly worried about this sort of
possibility, they place under a heading "Information Warfare." Nevertheless,
although the threat of Information Warfare is very real, an even bigger
danger is that the Department of Defense will use this threat to convince
the new Congress to repeal the Computer Security Act of 1987. This would
effectively allow the National Security Agency to declare martial law in
cyberspace, and could place the civilian computer industry into a tailspin.
<P>
To understand what the military is afraid of, imagine the Manchurian
Printer: a low-cost, high-quality laser printer, manufactured overseas, with
built-in secret self-destruct sequence. For years these printers could lay
dormant.  But send them a special coded message---perhaps a long sequence of
words that would never normally be printed together---and the printer would
lock its motors, overheat, and quickly burst into flames. Such an attack
might be the first salvo in an out-and-out war between the two countries.
Alternatively, an enemy company might simply use printers to start selective
fires, damage economic competitors, take out key personnel, and cause
mischief.
<P>
Unlike the movie the Manchurian Candidate, the technology behind the
Manchurian Printer isn't science fiction. Last October, Adobe accidentally
shipped a "time bomb" in Photoshop version 3.0 for the Macintosh. A time
bomb is a little piece of code buried inside a computer program that makes
the software stop running after a particular date. Adobe put two time bombs
into its Photoshop 3.0 program while the application was under development.
The purpose behind the time bombs was to force anybody who got an advance,
pre-release copy of the program to upgrade to the final shipping version.
But when it came time to ship the final version of Photoshop 3.0, Adobe's
engineers made a mistake: they only took out one of the bombs.
<P>
An engineer inside Adobe learned about the problem soon after the product
was shipped, and the company quickly issued a recall and a press release.
Adobe called the time bomb a "security code time constraint" and said that
"although this is an inconvenience to users, the security constraint neither
damages the program or hard drive, nor does it destroy any files."
<P>
It only takes a touch of creativity and a bit of paranoia to think up some
truly malicious variants on this theme. Imagine that a company wants to make
a hit with its new wordprocessor: instead of selling the program, the
company gives away free evaluation copies that are good for one month.
What's unknown to the users of this program is that while they are typing in
their letters, the program is simultaneously sniffing out and booby-trapping
every copy of Microsoft Word and WordPerfect that it finds on your system.
At the end of the month, all of your wordprocessors stop working: Instead of
letting you edit your memos, they print out ransom notes.
<P>
Any device that is equipped with a microprocessor can be equipped with such
a booby-trap. Radios, cellular telephones, and computers that are connected
to networks are particularly vulnerable, since an attacker can send them
messages without the knowledge or consent of their owners. Some booby- traps
aren't even intentional. What makes them particularly insidious is that it
is almost impossible to look at a device and figure out if one is present or
not. And there is no practical way to test for them, either. Even if you
could try a million different combinations a second, it would take more than
200 years to find a sequence that was just 8 characters long.
<P>
* * *
<P>
Information Warfare isn't limited just to things that break or go boom. The
Department of Defense is also worried about security holes that allow
attackers to break into commercial computers sitting on the Internet or take
over the telephone system.
<P>
"This nation is under IW attack today by a spectrum of adversaries ranging
from the teenage hacker to sophisticated, wide-ranging illegal entries into
telecommunications networks and computer systems," says a report of the
Defense Science Board Summer Study Task Force on Information Architecture
for the Battlefield, and issued last October by the Office of the Secretary
of Defense.
<P>
"Information Warfare could pervade throughout the spectrum of conflict to
create unprecedented effects. Further, with the dependence of modern
commerce and the military on computer controlled telecommunication
networks, data bases, enabling software and computers, the U.S. must
protect these assets relating to their vulnerabilities," the report warns.
<P>
Information warfare changes the rules of war fighting, the report warns. A
single soldier can wreak havoc on an enemy by reprogramming the opposing
side's computers. Modern networks can spread computer viruses faster than
missiles carrying biological warfare agents, and conceivably do more damage.
Worst of all, the tools of the information warrior are readily available to
civilians, terrorists and uniformed soldiers alike, and we are all potential
targets.
<P>
Not surprisingly, the unclassified version of the Pentagon's report barely
mentions the offensive possibilities of Information Warfare---capabilities
that the Pentagon currently has under development. Nevertheless, these
capabilities are alluded to in several of the diagrams, which show a keen
interest by the military in OOTW---Operations Other Than War.
<P>
"They have things like information influence, perception management, and
PSYOPS---psychological operations," says Wayne Madsen, a lead scientist at
the Computer Sciences Corporation in northern Virginia, who has studied
the summer study report.  "Basically, I think that what they are talking about
is having the capability to censor and put out propaganda on the networks.
That includes global news networks like CNN and BBC, your information
services, like CompServe and Prodigy," and communications satellite
networks. "When they talk about 'technology blockade,' they want to be able
to block data going into or out of a certain region of the world that they may
be attacking."
<P>
The report also hints at the possibility of lethal information warfare.
"That is screwing up navigation systems so airplanes crash and ships runs
aground.  Pretty dangerous stuff. We could have a lot of Iranian Airbuses
crashing if they start screwing that up," Madsen says. Indeed, says Madsen,
the army's Signal Warfare center in Warrenton, Virginia, has already invited
companies to develop computer viruses for battlefield operations.
<P>
Our best defense against Information Warfare is designing computers and
communications systems that are fundamentally more secure. Currently, the
federal organization with the most experience in the field of computer
security is the National Security Agency, the world's foremost spy
organization. But right now, NSA's actions are restricted by the 1987
Computer Security Act, which forbids the agency from playing a role in the
design of civilian computer systems. As a result, one of the implicit
conclusions of the Pentagon's report is to repeal the 1987 law, and untie
the NSA's hands. Indeed, the Pentagon is now embarking on a high-level
campaign to convince lawmakers that such a repeal would be in the nation's
best interests.
<P>
This argument confuses security with secrecy. It also ignores the real
reasons why the Computer Security Act was passed in the first place.
<P>
In the years before the 1987 law was passed, the NSA was on a campaign to
expand its power throughout American society by using its expertise in the
field of computer security as a lever. NSA tried to create a new category of
restricted technical information called "national security related
information." They asked Meade Data Corporation and other literature search
systems for lists of their users with foreign-sounding names. And, says
David Banisar, a policy analyst with the Washington-based Electronic Privacy
Information Center, "they investigated the computers that were used for the
tallying of the 1984 presidential election. Just the fact that the military is
looking in on how an election is being done is a very chilling thought. After
all, that is the hallmark of a banana republic."
<P>
The Computer Security Act was designed to nip this in the bud. It said that
standards for computer systems should be set in the open by the National
Institute of Standards and Technology.
<P>
Unfortunately, the Clinton Administration has found a way to get around the
Computer Security Act. It's placed an "NSA Liaison Officer" four doors down
from the NIST director's office. The two most important civilian computer
standards to be designed in recent years---the nation's new Escrowed
Encryption Standard (the "Clipper" chip) and the Digital Signature Standard
were both designed in secret by the NSA. The NSA has also been an unseen
hand behind the efforts on the part of the Clinton Administration to make
the nation's telephone system "wiretap friendly."
<P>
Many computer scientists have said that the NSA is designing weak standards
that it can circumvent, so that the nation's information warfare defenses do
not get in the way of the NSA's offensive capability.  Unfortunately,
there's no way to tell for sure. That's the real problem with designing
security standards in secret: there is simply no public accountability.
<P>
In this age of exploding laser printers, computer viruses, and information
warfare, we will increasingly rely on strong computer security to protect our
way of life. And just as importantly, these standards must be accountable to
the public. We simply can't take our digital locks and keys from a Pentagon
agency that's saying "trust me."
<P>
But the biggest danger of all would be for Congress to simply trust the
administration's information warriors and grant their wishes without any
public debate. That's what happened last October, when Congress passed the
FBI's "Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act" on an unrecorded
voice vote. The law turned the nation's telephone system into a surveillance
network for law enforcement agencies, at a cost to the U.S. taxpayer of $500
million.
<P>

=========WHAT FOLLOWS ARE CAPTIONS FOR THE ART===========<BR>
Photo: Box of Microsoft Word 6.0
<P>
Even though it's illegal, a lot of people like to "try out" software by
making a copy from a friend before they plunk down hundreds of dollars for
their own legal copy. Computer companies say that this is a form of software
piracy: many who try never buy. More than 2 billion dollars of software is
pirated annually, according to the Business Software Alliance.
<P>
One way that companies like Microsoft and Novel could fight back is by
booby-trapping their software. Sure, customers wouldn't like it if that stolen
copy of Microsoft Word suddenly decided to erase every letter or memo that
they've written in the past month, but what legal recourse would they have?<BR>
=====================<BR>
Photo: Cellular Telephone
<P>
Is your cellular phone turned on? Then your phone is broadcasting your
position every time it sends out its electronic "heartbeat."  Some law
enforcement agencies now have equipment that lets them home in on any
cellular telephone they wish (similar technology was used recently to catch
infamous computer criminal Kevin Mitnick). Perhaps that's the reason that
the Israeli government recently ordered its soldiers along the boarder to stop
using their cellular telephones to order late night pizzas: the telephone's
radio signal could be a become a homing beacon for terrorist's missiles.<BR>
===================<BR>
Photo: Floppy Disk
<P>
Beware of disks bearing gifts. In 1989, nearly 7000 subscribers of the British
magazine PC Business World and 3500 people from the World Health
Organization's database received a disk in the mail labeled "AIDS
Information Introductory Diskette Version 2.0". People who inserted the
disks into their computers and ran the programs soon found out otherwise:
the disks actually contained a so-called trojan horse that disabled the
victims' computers and demanded a ransom.<BR>
==================<BR>
Photo: A computer with a screen from America Online, and a modem
<P>
Several years ago, users of Prodigy were shocked to find that copies of
documents on their computers had been copied into special "buffers" used by
Prodigy's DOS software. Prodigy insisted that the copied data was the result
of a software bug, and it wasn't spying on its customers. But fundamentally,
if you use a modem to access America Online, Prodigy or Compuserve, there
is no way to be sure that your computer isn't spying on you while you surf
the information highway.<BR>
==================<BR>
HP's recall affects only OfficeJet  printers with serial numbers that begin
US4B1-US4B9, US4C1-US4C9, US4BA-US4BU, or US4CA-US4CK. Worried

Vilkaitis is not correct.  Postings on alt.security.pgp stated that Finnish
authorities secured a warrant to seize the equipment the Finnish Anonymous
Server runs on.  The owner of the Server negotiated a deal with the
authorities where he released the identity of _one_ user of the Server and
the authorities didn't seize the equipment.
<P>
My understanding of the behind-the-scenes goings on is that the Church of
Scientology is bringing copyright charges against one of its former
ministers who is now a vocal critic of the CoS on the Internet.  The
sequence of events, as I understand it, is that someone used the Finnish
Anonymous Server to post allegedly copyright material on USENET.  The CoS
asked the FBI to talk to Interpol who talked to the Finnish Police about
getting the ID information of the anonymous poster.  Once this ID
information was released by the owner of the Server it was immediately
handed over to CoS people.

Nonetheless, this does represent a worrying precedent.  There are persistent
rumours that the entire user base of at least one anonymizing service has
been compromised by covert action by a security agency, and that's just the 
start.  As has been pointed out elsewhere, any agency monitoring
international communications (NSA in the US and GCHQ in the UK, to name two)
should have little trouble matching anon ID with real ID if the message is
in plaintext and the server in another country.  Matching messages where the 
first leg is PGP-encoded (and the server decodes before retransmission) would 
be more difficult, but by no means impossible.
<P>
The only sensible conclusion is that anon remailers provide anonymity from
your peers, not from the law.  If you use them illegally, you may well be
identified.  Them's the breaks.

&gt;Case #1 ...  A Swedish journalist-researcher "reveals" that an Anonymous<BR>
&gt;Case #2 ...  Finnish Police receive a request from U.S. law enforcement
<P>
	There have been suggestions on the net (in alt.privacy.anon-server,
I think) that these two events may well have been related: specifically that
the Church of Scientology might have been indirectly responsible for the
'This anon server is used by pedophiles: shock, horror' stories in the first
place, as an attempt to discredit the anon server in order to make the
police more likely to raid it for them/ get it shut down. This is only
speculation, but it is consistent with their style. It is their standard
policy to attempt to discredit their opponents through character
assassination at the same time as they attack them through legal means.
<P>
	For instance, one of the recent posters of copyright material to
alt.religion.scientology was described in passing in a Scientology press
release as someone who conducted execution-style killings of his pets in
front of his children. Paulette Cooper, who wrote a book entitled _The
Scandal of Scientology_, found a circular (supposedly written by `a
concerned neighbor') circulating around her apartment block suggesting her
`removal from our residence, and if possible, have her put under appropriate
psychiatric care.' Several critics of scientology have been accused (and
sometimes tried) for crimes that they did not commit, after having
(apparently) been framed by scientologists.
<P>
	Many people have used the anon server to post critical articles
about Scientology.  I suspect the church would like it discredited. (Massive
amounts of information about this and the church in general can be found at

&gt;They ended up doing the calculation, and storing a compressed table giving<BR>
&gt;the difference between the calculated values and the legal ones.  Never mind<BR>
&gt;reality -- custom ruled.
<P>
I can beat that.  I recently ported a mess of old FORTRAN meteorological
code to C++, and I extensively expanded the validation suite in the process.
<P>
During the process I learned that a number of my newly ported functions were
returning values a hair off (typically &lt; 0.5%, when the number of
significant digits should have resulted in errors two orders of magnitude
smaller).  I traced the problem to the fact that I was using the best
currently known physical constants, while the standard reference tables were
using values from the 1960s.  Reasonable, since it was published in 1965,
but I had to address the differences in the results.
<P>
After consulting with the working meteorologists, I eventually put the
1960-era physical constants back into the software.  As a practical matter,
the resolution of the available data is still coarse enough that the small
differences won't make any difference, and it is easier for them to compare
the final results than for FORTRAN programmers to understand scientific C++
classes.
<P>
But it still grates.  At least I was able to eliminate a number of duplicate
functions.  Previously, someone had made a token effort to include a
validation suite (with typically &lt;10 test cases per function), but they made
no effort to identify slow and/or inaccurate functions.  A tradeoff of speed
for accuracy is often justified, but who would ever want to use a function
which is significantly slower and less accurate than another one?

The conference on Society and the Future of Computing (SFC'95) will be
held from June 11th to 14th in Durango, Colorado.  This conference is 
an initiative of the US Public Policy Committee of the Association for
Computing Machinery (USACM).  Its focus is on opportunities for socially
beneficial applications of computing technology: visions of what's
possible ten years from now and agendas for computer science research
that can make those visions come true.

German Railway attempted, Sunday March 12 1995 evening, to replace its long
established railway switch tower at Hamburg-Altona station by a fully
computerized system manufactured by Siemens branch on railway technology.
Altona station is one of Germany's large station, with many national and
international lines starting or ending here or passing through. Each day,
about 30,000 travellers arrive or depart here, in addition to more than
100,000 passengers using local rapid (S-Bahn) or regional trains.
<P>
With about 250 rail shunts and an equivalent number of signals, the old
system consisted of 7 major switch-stands, controlled by roughly 50
experienced switchmen. Siemens and German Railway decided to completely
change the topology with now about 18 switch-stands to be controlled by
INTEL-486 based Real-Time systems. The different switch computers are
coordinated by one central operating and display system (BAR 16, for Bedien-
und-Anzeige-Rechner, and 16 standing for 16-Bit connection). PC hardware is
redundant (2 processors, modular RAM, no disk) to enhance availability and
reliability as requested by the certification authority (Eisenbahn
Bundes-Amt, EBA). The new architecture is incompatible with the old one and
it cannot run in parallel to the old; one economic advantage is that the new
system needs about 40 switchmen less which only control the central BAR
site.
<P>
Immediately after starting the new systems, the central computer (BAR 16)
failed. Siemens' experts could not find the cause for hours, so German
Railway decided to close up the whole station, forcing passengers to North
and South to start from locations up to 25 kilometers away. Search for the
fault was difficult as it were very rare. Only on Tuesday afternoon, experts
detected that under certain conditions a stack overflow happened. When
looking into the routine which should handle stack overflows, they found
that this went into a deadloop due to a programming error. Though sufficient
free space was available in principle, the allocation of the stack required
to build a new RAM with 4,000 bytes onstead of 3,500 as foreseen (indeed,
overflow was only with few bytes, so +500 bytes adds some safety :-). Only
on Wednesday morning, the bug (which appeared only 4 times in 2 days) was
fixed, and rail traffic began to return to Altona station on Wednesday 1:59
pm. But as the switchmen are not accustomed to the new system, even days
later allowed restricted traffic.
<P>
In a press conference, the responsible Siemens manager argued that the
"hidden" faults were difficult to find, and that Siemens experts had assumed
that the routine handling stack overflow would NEVER be used! The related
operating system is regarded by Siemens as rather safe RT system :-)
<P>
In German media (you know: Hamburg is media capital of Germany :-), a
discussion on overreliance on computers started. This was stimulated by
statements of Siemens and German Railway that any future computer failure
will require to again stop the whole switching system to avoid any safety
hazard. This is very bad news as the same system is being installed at
another site connecting main railway station (Hauptbahnhof) with Berlin and
controlling all goods transport originating and ending in Hamburg harbour
(Europes 2nd largest container harbour). [Another reason for discussing
overreliance are recent bad news on Airbuses, most of which are finally
assembled in Hamburg-Finkenwerder's Airbus factories, with many operational
Airbuses being maintained in Lufthansa's Hamburg workshops].
<P>
The Altona Railway software glitch is another example where (for purposes of
rationalisation) all customers become fully dependent of a computerized
system.  Moreover, the few remaining switchmen will NOT be able to
understand, in critical situations, why the computer system behaves as it
does, and they will ONLY be able to switch off the whole system as NO manual
mode is foreseen!

Security experts are disdainful of the low level of programming talent
displayed in the pirate program Credit Master, which generates phony credit
card numbers.  The program works by mimicking the simple "checksum"
algorithm that creates the last four digits of a credit card; the checksum
formula was developed merely to prevent data-entry errors and never meant to
be high-tech security screening.  Four college students were arrested last
week in Nassau County, NY, charged with using a program to generate false
credit numbers and order thousands of dollars of goods.  The students then
had the merchandise shipped to addresses staked out by the police -- a
mistake almost as bad as using cheap programs.  (The New York Times, 19 Mar
1995, p.18)

Seen in the Washington Post:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  As part of a war on traffic congestion, Montgomery County Maryland
  transit officials plan to use the satellite &lt;GPS - "one of the same
  satellites the Pentagon used during the Persian Gulf War"&gt; to keep buses
  on time and increase safety for Ride-On's 58,000 weekday riders.  ...
  When the system is begun countywide later this year, county technicians
  will be able to change traffic signals to green as a tardy bus approaches
  an intersection.  When people call to ask for bus information, a county
  transit employee will be able to give them the precise time a buss will
  arrive instead of when it is scheduled to be there.  In an emergency,
  police will know the bus's exact location and will be able ***to listen in
  over a microphone installed in the bus."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
I see two risks here:
<UL>
<LI>If riders become dependent on calling in for information on EXACTLY when
  a bus will be at a particular location, the transit authority will soon
  be overloaded with phone calls and thus probably making it more difficult
  for people calling for other reasons to get through (a relatively minor
  risk given that this is probably not a critical service phone number?)

<LI>What are the criteria for when the police are allowed to listen in over
  the microphone installed in the bus?  Slowly, but surely, 1984 is approaching
  (or is time just flowing backwards :-)

An attribute of the Internet it that it makes one-to-many personal
communication more effective and more resistant to censorship than any prior
form of communication. Therein lies some risks.  I am not sure which are
most real. Consider the following.
<P>
It seems that everyone from Scientologists, to United States senators, to
Swedish journalists, to the National Security Agency, to holocaust
survivors, wants to censor or constrain the net in some way. Indeed, nearly
everyone on this planet seems to believe that we must, at all costs, censor
some other person or group. If net censorship proves to be impossible, then
the logical conclusion is that everyone, ourselves included, will come to
oppose the net. The continued existence of the net must therefore be at
risk; right?
<P>
Can it be that the stability of civilization is dependent on the natural
barriers to effective one-to-many communication?  Without the barriers,
criminals, pranksters, demagogues, exploiters, fanatics, the politically
incorrect, and the religiously incorrect, will all be able to do their thing
more effectively.  Society becomes more vulnerable, to hoaxes, scams, spams,
diatribes, sensationalism, and manipulation. Many laws may become
unenforceable. Is it the net that threatens civilization?
<P>
More speculative, but perhaps more likely, is the eventual development of a
number of object-oriented virus-like agents able to police the net for us.
Call it distributed RoboCop. The risk then will be to prevent it from
becoming RoboSoverign.  :-/

Recently there was an article in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution about an
association of pediatricians (I forget the group's exact name offhand) that
was lobbying for a complete ban on advertising for alcoholic beverages,
citing health and economic benefits.  What makes this issue pertinent for
Risks readers, I believe, is the risk of rampant cost-benefit analysis.  The
problem is not so much with the technique itself, which I have often used
with great success, as it is with the slippery slope people find themselves
on once they try to apply it to social situations and human behavior that
have strong intangible elements.  Alcohol consumption is a case in point.
Even in my surliest moods toward purveyors of political correctness, I would
agree that alcohol can carry a heavy social burden.  So what?  Societies are
good at identifying and labelling (and then castigating!) perceived burdens.
While not a raving libertarian, I am disturbed by forces that trot
"scientific method" out on a leash (e.g. cost-benefit analysis) to determine
social "costs" and "benefits" and use the results to try and dictate
behavior.
<P>
I understand that proponents of the Republican Contract With America
want to use cost-benefit analysis as a tool to determine when environmental
regulation is appropriate.  This is a seductive idea on its face, and
speaks to the same general problem of trying to reduce human value
judgments to the level of dollars and cents.  The yin and yang of
individual right versus social responsibility is ancient and irremediable.
Where one triumphs the other suffers.  Yet the human spirit dwells most
often in the wasteland between libertarianism and communitarianism, in
my humble opinion.  As much as the engineering side of my nature wants to
believe we all benefit from being able to analyze social issues in the
mathematical realm, mathematics is about probing the edges of problems
and not about dwelling in the comfortable middle ground.
<P>
I guess my real beef with cost-benefit analysis, at least as I have seen it
practiced by social policy types, is that it skews in favor of social
benefit, given that quantizing individual liberty is at best an ethereal
exercise.  When confronted with a statistic such as one shouting out that
"alcohol consumption costs the US in excess of $100 billion per year in
illness, disability, and lost productivity", is one to assume that otherwise
rational individuals are wantonly placing some tremendous burden on society
with no commensurate return?  That's a statistic racing away from the center
of any reasoned debate.
<P>
We are shackling ourselves with tautologies, brought on by a desire
to remove judgment from public discourse. Oppression flows from within.

Jon Green says about anon remailers that if "you use them illegally, you may
well be identified.  Them's the breaks."
<P>
Not so fast.  A friend of mine, a political activist of the 1960s, says of
his political activities, that "I've been jailed several times, always for
something I actually did.  But none of it was illegal."  And he points out
that in court all the cases were either dismissed or found in his favor.
<P>
So the risk of abuse is clear: you may be identified, and pursued by
authority (or by the Church of Scientology) even if you have done nothing
illegal.  This has a lot to do with the original point of this thread.

The recent discussions of risks-of-dates (RISK-16.74, etc.) and Pentium
floating point bugs reminded me ...
<P>
Some years ago, I had to write a program to match the accounting
records from the database server with those of the batch system.  The
records were in different formats: the database server used the system
clock and the batch system used day-of-year+hhmmss.
<P>
The database vendor had provided a conversion routine which I happily
used, only to discover that there were discrepancies of up to 3
minutes between the two systems' records.  Eventually I determined
that the database vendor's conversion routine was faulty.
<P>
I quickly wrote some code in PL/I using double-precision floating
point arithmetic (which gave me 55-bit precision, more than enough)
and everything worked fine.  My code was only a few lines, compared
with the pages of convolution that the vendor had provided (it was in
assembler, emulating 48-bit integer arithmetic on a 32-bit system).
<P>
The only reason I caught this error was that I happened to be writing
the program near the end of the year: the conversion routine's error
increased from almost nothing in January to about 3 minutes in
December.  If I had written the code in January, I probably wouldn't
have caught the error.  But the error probably wouldn't have existed
in the first place if the conversion code had been written with
floating point instead of integer arithmetic.

For the last 6 months, people trying to reach my company have been
misdirected to the phone number of some poor woman whose family has had
ever-increasing numbers of telephone calls for a company she has never heard
of.  We finally talked to her today and found out that she has been
inundated over the last few weeks as a result of articles in Newsweek and
the Wall Street journal mentioning my company's name.
<P>
She has been trying to get the phone company information operator to
make the change since December of 1994, but they have repeatedly told
her that her phone number was that of my company and they they could not
change it for her.
<P>
Finally, today, a reporter called me, told me of the problem he had in
finding me, and started me down the path to track down this problem. 
Several operators and phone companies later (two phone companies were
involved here - and they don't talk to each other) I found out that
neither company could change the listing - the other one had it.
<P>
I got desperate and called the information operator (who had told me
previously that they could not change these things).  She told me she
would change it right away in both databases.
<P>
So I called again a little bit later only to find the number had not
been changed and that they could not change it except from the business
office.  The supervisor (it was now after 5PM) tried to find someone in
the business office to authorize the change.
<P>
Meanwhile, my wife had convinced the poor woman whose family has been
traumatized for the last 4 months to give people the new number by
herself - there was a certain telephone company hatred comraderie
between them - they both said that they had no problem believing that
phone companies could screw up this badly.
<P>
It is now the weekend, and I am assured by all parties that if I will
only try this whole thing again next week sometime, it will be fixed in
a jiffie.  I'm getting ready to call my lawyer.

  ... Prodigy insisted that the copied data was the result of a software
  bug, and it wasn't spying on its customers.  But fundamentally, if you use
  a modem to access ..., there is no way to be sure that your computer isn't
  spying on you while you surf the information highway."  [Simson Garfinkel]
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The above is another example of insufficient research.  There was and is no
software bug.  When you delete a file in DOS, all you are deleting is the
location of the file that is stored in the FAT (File Allocation Table).  The
file itself remains on the disk until it eventually gets written over by new
files.  Prodigy software reserves a "space" on your disk, the size of which
is determined by you when you load their software.  They use this "space" to
cache data that your computer needs to display information on your screen.
Use of this space saves large amounts of time because if the data is already
on your disk, then they don't have to waste time transferring it to you from
a distant location.  Initially when this "space" is first allocated, there
will be remnants of your old files in it.  Eventually, as more and more data
is "cached" in this "space" all your old file info will be written over and
no longer viewable.  When people became concerned, Prodigy offered free
software that would erase all the users old files from that allocated space.
They also allowed an independent software auditor to inspect their software
to see if it was being used to upload the users files to Prodigy.  The
Auditor reported that it was not written to do that.  That's not to say that
it couldn't be.  Of course it could be.  But if you don't want to risk loss
of privacy, then disconnect your modem, LAN, or any other comm link you may
have.  Why?  Because any service could "sneak a peek", not just the ones you
mentioned.  You obviously are at risk yourself since your address indicates
that you are connected to the internet in some fashion.

Monday, March 20, 1995                  Subject of 'info' for details
                                        Direct questions to Vinn K. Beigh
</PRE>
The First Bank of Internet, FBOI, is announcing the initiation of
transaction processing services for Internet electronic commerce.  
Purchases over the Internet can now be made without exposing personal
credit card information.  Vendors can now sell products on the Internet
without the restrictions imposed by credit card use.
<P>
Other Internet purchase procedures require personal credit card information.  
Those proceedings will be monitored by thousands of people all over
the world.  Some will attempt to either decode the credit card information
or impersonate the customer in future transactions.  
<P>
The alternative to personal credit cards for electronic commerce is
based on an FBOI procured Visa (tm) Automated Teller Machine (ATM) card.
The card is prepaid, PIN protected, replaceable, disposable, and good 
at over 200,000 Visa/PLUS (tm) ATMs in 83 countries.  
<P>
The safety of FBOI is ensured because access to ATM funds without 
possession of both the ATM card and the Personal Identification Number 
(PIN) is not possible.  ATM cards are also better than credit cards because
their purchase does not require the personal, financial, and employment 
background of the consumer.
<P>
The Visa ATM card is not a credit card.  It is cash.  The ATM card 
will be used as a checking account.  Using an ATM card allows consumers 
to set aside dedicated funds for Internet data purchases.  It provides 
a safe, secure way to transfer cash from consumers to producers.  In
addition, consumers can reclaim their funds at any time using an ATM.
<P>
A check/invoice procedure is used that consumers will find familiar.  
The consumer first places an order with a vendor.  The consumer then 
sends to the vendor or FBOI an e-mail 'check' for the purchase of the 
program/file/data product.  The vendor sends FBOI an e-mail 'invoice'.
FBOI will reconcile the transaction and send e-mail transaction receipts 
to both the vendor and customer.  Cash will be taken from the customer 
ATM account and credited to the vendor for later payment.  FBOI charges 
a 5% vendor commission per transaction.
<P>
Producers of software, information collections, newsletters, graphics, 
and other data products can use FBOI services for the sale of their 
products.   These vendors can sell their products for prices that would 
be too low for credit card transactions.  Subscription services that 
charge an up-front fee for one time access to data depositories and 
services also can participate. 
<P>
Vendors will benefit from a very large consumer base because this 
global solution works just as well outside the U.S. as within the U.S..
The Visa ATM network is worldwide.  Consumers will benefit from a very
large vendor base because software produced in non-North American 
countries can be offered for sale much easier than now.
<P>
The worldwide producers on the Internet can use FBOI services without the
expense of owning or renting a dedicated Internet server or a World-Wide 
Web site.  E-mail is the cheapest and simplest of all Internet services. 
Large Internet commercial services will soon be starting that provide only 
for the on-line purchase of catalog products.  It will not be possible
for the individual producer to sell a data product using those services.  
Those services will collect the consumers credit card information in 
advance because of Internet security problems.
<P>
FBOI transmits no sensitive information over the Internet and prevents
forgery and impersonation by using Pretty Good Privacy, PGP (tm), 
software for all transactions.  This freeware provides excellent 
authentication and anti-alteration security.
<P>
In addition to the unsecured nature of the Internet, consumers should be 
hesitant giving out their credit card information to vendors of unknown 
credibility.  Tracking is much harder on the Internet than magazine 
direct marketing.  Also, it is not the same as mail order merchandise 
since U.S. Postal Service and Federal Trade Commission mail order laws 
do not apply to the Internet.
<P>
For high volume, low cost, transactions directly between producers and 
consumers on the Internet contact FBOI.
<P>
Further information can be obtained from The First Bank of Internet
by sending an e-mail message with the subject "info" to &lt;<A HREF="mailto:fboi@netcom.com">fboi@netcom.com</A>&gt;.

The Deutsche Bahn AG, the German train company, has been working round the
clock for a long time to a) electrify the state of Schleswig-Holstein, which
is just north of the city-state Hamburg, and b) to install a full
computerized train regulation system. The big traintable change is scheduled
for next Sunday (March 26), when the daylight time change takes effect, I
believe.  They went on-line with the regulation system last week and all
h*** broke loose.  It was okay for the first few hours, and then suddenly
went berserk.  I don't have all the details, as I have only listened to
radio news the past few days, but they ended up having to route all traffic
around this major switching point. The train station in Hamburg Altona,
where the diesel locomotives are removed and electric ones put on for
continuing trains, or where most people just have to change trains, was put
out of service. People had to take the S-Bahn or a bus to the main train
station, and ended up missing connections.  (And then we have the problem
with the local trains being fuller than Indian trains because of a special
super-cheap deal on weekends, but that's another and computer-unrelated
story.)
<P>
I do not know for certain if Siemens is the main manufacturer, but I suspect
that it is them together with AEG. They just founded a company together with
ABB in Sweden to combine all their rail knowledge. Yes, they subcontract out
a lot, some to a little company in Kiel, a bunch to Third-World company (but
this is just rumor). How could this pass the testing phase? Well, this is
not the first time Siemens has boo-booed (remember the microphone system in
the Bundestag? There have been many others). My personal opinion is that
Siemens/Sietec does not have control of their Quality Assurance and there
are too many programmers there that believe that they can do no wrong, and
bosses who believe them, because it costs too much to actually do massive
testing. German programmers tend to take it as a personal insult when a
fault is detected in code that they have written. Companies like
Siemens/Sietec exacerbate the situation. I repeat, this is my personal
opinion based on unscientific surveys conducted during drinking and card
playing sessions.... so nothing eminently quotable.
<P>
There should be an article in Computerwoche (German language) soon about it
when the CeBit smoke clears, they enjoy reporting about Siemens/Sietec
disasters. I'll keep an eye out for more details.

   The Canadian government's first attempt at electronic distribution of its
budget last month could have created havoc -- but not because of the
measures it contains.  A virus was discovered about an hour before more than
5,000 disks containing budget information were to be sent to the country's
major financial institutions.  One expert is quoted as saying the situation
could have been catastrophic for banks etc.
<P>
   The RCMP are investigating how the unnamed virus (said to be boot-sector
or FAT destructive) had found its way onto the master disk being used to
make copies. The master had passed two Revenue Canada virus scans but a last
minute check by the company hired to do the copying and distribution turned
up the critter.
<P>
   Given the super secrecy and security surrounding the budget, there are
serious questions as to how this could have happened. The RISKS involved in
the federal government spreading viruses are obvious!

I just heard on the radio an announcement of a new safety project for
farmers. Farming is one of the most hazardous occupations, by usual
measures, with a significant number of injuries and fatalities happening
when farmers get off of a tractor or similar piece of equipment to do a
brief task like untangling something, but leave the equipment running. The
proposed fix? Use the GPS satellite location system, which will be used by a
piece of equipment worn by the farmer and another on the tractor: When they
move apart, the tractor gets turned off.
<P>
I suspect "the risks are obvious", as well as the availability of MUCH
simpler technologies to do the distance sensing if in fact that is a good
thing to do....

Computers have, in most cases, improved the overall quality of life for us.
When a computer process goes smoothly we are amazed at the speed and
accuracy of the machine.  But when something goes wrong, it is human nature
to want to place the blame upon someone or something.  When the problem is
minor we can usually laugh it off or write it off as a "computer error",
whether or not this is actually true.  But, when the problem has caused
severe (life-threatening) consequences we need in depth explanations of
accountability.
<P>
Also, the number of people affected by computer errors can range from one
person who is directly involved in the use of the computer - to many people
who are innocent bystanders.  If the operator is the only one inconvenienced
by a computer error assuming it created a minor problem, blame can be
shrugged off.  While at the other extreme, if large numbers of people are
affected by the error, blame is sought.
<P>
Therefore, there are two determining factors which cause us to want to place
blame for the occurrence of computer errors.  One factor is the severity of
the problem and the other one is the number of people affected.
<P>
With the increasing involvement of computers in our daily lives the number
of errors occurring is also increasing.  Errors seen many times in the past
are still occurring while new errors are cropping up with the use of new
technology.  The dependent relationships between the software, hardware,
data input (whether it is by a person or computer generated), procedures,
and the communication links [<A HREF="/Risks/9.61.html">risks-9.61</A>], create a very complex environment.
The blind trust we have in computers and the people who operate or program
them may need to be reevaluated.  In other words, can and should we always
trust a computer operator or a computer with the ever increasing processing
of data which affect our lives and then look to blame when failure occurs?
Or should we decrease or adjust the trust we place on data input and
computers?
<P>
While I was doing a search for articles at the library on the periodical
database and happen to be short of time one night, the computer froze
suddenly for no apparent reason.  I had already spent 30 of my precious 90
minutes reading abstracts and marking (to print) the ones I thought were
relevant.  I had not yet printed the abstracts when the computer stopped
responding to keystrokes.  I asked the reference librarian if there was
anything that could be done.  He said "Not usually, but try [Ctrl] Z or
[Ctrl] [Enter]."  I did - but nothing happened.  He shrugged.  I shrugged
and laughed, then moved over to another machine to start my work all over
again...how fitting.  I would not have enough time to make copies of the
articles I searched for and would have to return another day.
<P>
I probably should not have trusted the computer to get me smoothly through
my work that night; I left no time for computer error expecting the computer
to be 100% reliable.

In a recent comp.risks post, Dick Mills speculates that the stability of
civilization up to now may have depended on the ineffectiveness of
one-to-many communication, and that the Internet condemns us to drown in
memetic garbage generated by kooks, fanatics, and evangelists.
<P>
I suggest Mr. Mills think of it as evolution in action.  The people -- and
civilizations -- that survive will be those who learn and teach critical
reading and thinking skills.  This is strictly analogous to the selection
effect of biological plagues.

The risks of cost-benefit analysis that I see are more direct.  First, in
order to do a cost-benefit analysis, you have to make assumptions about
relative values.  It is totally impossible to do this in a
politically-neutral way.  Consider, say, a C-B analysis of a wetland
development done by a real-estate developer and and the same analysis done
by Greenpeace.  No way are they going to be similar.
<P>
Second, C-B analyses are trotted out as some kind of Gospel.  Somebody comes
up with the numbers, lawmakers or bureaucrats make decisions, and the public
is stuck with the results.  What if the analysis is wildly off?  Where is
the responsibility?
<P>
I would like to see the organizations who do these analyses post a bond.
Won't happen, but it's interesting to think about.

[...] Or more generally, cost-benefit analysis skews in favor of what can be
"measured" (medical costs, property values, paycheck) at the expense of the
"intangible" (freedom, nice-smelling air, peace of mind, a good day fishing,
national security, employee loyalty).
<P>
Where social benefit is easily measured, it skews towards social benefit.
Where social benefit is not easily measured, it skews away.  I can well
imagine a statistical arms race between the two sides of any costly policy,
attempting to assign value to the otherwise intangible costs and benefits of
the policy.  It's also an entertaining game to see what intangibles are
considered so important that they should not have a price tag attached (and
by whom).

In a recent posting, Simson Garfinkel used a reference to Prodigy's former
method of handling swap space to point out that certain types of online
access systems leave you vulnerable.  In today's issue, Frank Ferguson tries
to indicate, using details of the MS-DOS FAT and delete function, that such
a concern is invalid.  They are, or course, both right, but Garfinkel is
righter.
<P>
While Prodigy never did have any specific function in their software to
browse and return information from the user's computer to the company, the
software did have provisions to automatically update software.  This could
(although it wasn't) be used to run other types of software without the
user being aware of it.  But we don't have to pick on Prodigy.  Other
commercial systems "take over" your machine when you run the front end
software.  This is, of course, done to ease the burden of use for the
subscriber, but it does mean that the online service can basically do 
anything they want with your computer.  (The same, of course, is true for
any software, but commercial online systems have the advantage of being
in communication with their own software while it is running on your machine.)
<P>
We need not limit the discussion to commercial services.  GUI (graphical
user interface) systems tend to have a lot of security loopholes and hiding 
places anyway.  The X system has provisions for a remote system to control
your workstation.  The various World Wide Web browsers, particularly the
graphical ones like Mosaic, have the ability to both transfer files and
invoke execution of programs.  That's all you need for a really nifty
virus/worm ...

I content that this behavior *is* a bug.  The proof is in the public's
reaction to finding bits of "their" files in the Prodigy cache area.
<P>
To give a human metaphor, imagine a coworker who casually leafs through the
papers on your desk while waiting for you to get off the phone.  This might
be nothing more than a nervous mannerism and he may be totally unaware of
what he's doing, but very few people won't be seriously annoyed at him.
<P>
To avoid even the appearance of impropiety, most people carefully stare
into space (or read a magazine) in this situation.
<P>
Prodigy didn't observe this behavior (which in the computer world would have
been allocating the space and immediately wiping the current data); it
grabbed some disk space and saved a few seconds by not wiping the existing
data...
<P>
... and found itself tremendously embarrassed because it violated one of the
prime rules of our society (regarding privacy).  The fact that we're still
discussing this years later proves how sensitive of a nerve it hit!
<P>
In an era when computers were scarce resources and few people had frequent
interactions with one, such behavior could be justified as a valid
engineering tradeoff.  But computers are now routinely used by a large part
of the population, and it is incumbent on the programmer to observe the
social conventions even if it proves to be moderately "expensive."

This "announcement" is so full of holes as to be ludicrous. 
<OL>
<LI>According to the NC Banking Commission, use of the term "bank", with a
    very few limited exceptions, is illegal for anyone but an organization
    that is a federally (FDIC) or state chartered, regulated entity. The NC
    Banking Commission has taken an interest in this announcement, and is
    forwarding the info to the FDIC...

<LI>"The alternative to personal credit cards for electronic commerce is
    based on an FBOI procured Visa (tm) Automated Teller Machine (ATM) card.
    The card is prepaid, PIN protected, replaceable, disposable, and good
    at over 200,000 Visa/PLUS (tm) ATMs in 83 countries.  "
<P>
Translation: 'you send us $x.xx to keep on account (with no interest accrued
to you). We deduct purchases from this balance'. What happens if we disagree
on the balance and/or dispute transactions? Because this an ATM card as
opposed to a credit card, normal fraud liability limitations ($50.00 US)
and disputed charge reversals are not in effect. If someone fraudulently
charges against your ATM account, you potentially bear the full loss.
<P>
Also, the "vendor" info, sent in response to the specified E-mail request,
indicates that the ATM cards are not "rechargeable". When you run your
balance down, you must buy a new one. FBOI charges a 5% commission to
establish a new card for you (ie - the "setup" fee is 5% of the balance you
wish to put on account; when that runs out, you pay another 5% for a new
card).  Since they charge vendors a 5% commission per transaction, FBOI is
keeping 10% of all funds that move through their system.

<LI>"The safety of FBOI is ensured because access to ATM funds without 
   possession of both the ATM card and the Personal Identification Number 
   (PIN) is not possible.  ATM cards are also better than credit cards because
   their purchase does not require the personal, financial, and employment 
   background of the consumer."
<P>
Here is how a transaction is instigated (from FBOI info):
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   "*FBOI procedures for creating a vendor E-mail invoice*
    FBOI E-mail invoices are a two line message created by a FBOI vendor.
    Line one of the message contains the customer Internet E-mail address.
    Line two contains the transaction amount in US dollars.  This message
    must then be encrypted, signed, in ASCII, and in Text using the PGP
    command "PGP -seat invoice fboi".  The "invoice.asc" is then ready to
    be E-mailed to <A HREF="mailto:fboi@netcom.com">fboi@netcom.com</A> with subject "invoice".  FBOI will issue
    an E-mail transaction receipt."
<P>
    "*FBOI procedures for creating a customer E-mail check*
    FBOI E-mail checks are a two line message created by a FBOI customer.
    Line one of the message contains the vendor Internet E-mail address.
    Line two contains the transaction amount in US dollars.  This message
    must then be encrypted, signed, in ASCII, and in Text using the PGP
    command "PGP -seat check fboi".  The "check.asc" is then ready to be
    E-mailed to <A HREF="mailto:fboi@netcom.com">fboi@netcom.com</A> with subject "check".  FBOI will issue an
    E-mail transaction receipt."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
FBOI then reconciles the above transactions and sends payment to the vendor
(or credits the vendor's ATM card). Note that FBOI recommends product pricing
at around ONE US DOLLAR for items! (Almost-Freeware, anyone?)

<LI>"...In addition, consumers can reclaim their funds at any time using 
    an ATM."
<P>
At what service charge per transaction? What limitations on withdrawal
amounts (how many transactions will it take to empty my account)? Any
yearly fees for this privilege? FBOI info is rather vague in this regard.
The only pertinent comment I saw was (pertaining to vendor payment):
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    "... While the Visa ATM card as a payment method has many
    advantages (portable, anonymous, and cash in any country of the world),
    your ATM may not dispense the entire payment due to the exchange rate
    and possible ATM fees."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI>"...Those services will collect the consumers credit card information in 
   advance because of Internet security problems."
<P>
Since those are still credit card transactions, the consumer has much better
dispute resolution abilities.

<LI>"FBOI transmits no sensitive information over the Internet and prevents
    forgery and impersonation by using Pretty Good Privacy, PGP (tm), 
    software for all transactions.  This freeware provides excellent 
    authentication and anti-alteration security."
<P>
The description of transactions as in (3) above may or may not be subject
to spoofing. I'm not up enough on crypto to comment.

<LI>"In addition to the unsecured nature of the Internet, consumers should be 
   hesitant giving out their credit card information to vendors of unknown 
   credibility."
<P>
You mean like FBOI?? Based out of a Netcom account (instead of a .com domain)?

<LI>"...since U.S. Postal Service and Federal Trade Commission mail order laws 
    do not apply to the Internet."
<P>
The laws may not apply to the Internet per se, but credit card transactions 
are still subject to all of the controls of typical "mail order" as is 
normally practiced via telephone.

<LI>"The First Bank of Internet (tm) is not a lending institution, and is not
    chartered."
<P>
This says volumes.... (see (1), above).  
</OL>
And finally:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    "When FBOI procures a Visa ATM card for vendor customers the card
    becomes their money.  FBOI will be granted access to their funds
    through the FBOI customer agreement allowing FBOI to possess a
    <U>duplicate card.</U>"

The FBOI card does seem to address some of the security concerns for commerce
over the net.  The replacement of one number by another does not provide
any particular safety, but the limit on the card does restrict the damage.
However, inquiring minds want to know:
<P>
How easy is it, aside from emptying the account, to cancel/change/get a new
card?  Is there a fee?  Is there any recourse if someone empties the account
before you do?
<P>
Does the encryption apply only to the card number, or to the whole transaction,
including time and date stamp?
<P>
Does the encryption software come with the card?  Is it a smart card?  Do
you need a card reader of some type?  What platforms is the software available
on?  Is the user responsible for getting/setting up the software?
<P>
By using PGP is the FBOI restricting its operations to the US?  Is the
version of PGP that they are using operating with the RSA algorithm, or
another?  Is the key size restricted?
<P>
If this really does work over E-mail, why do you keep talking about ATM?
(Does it only work over asynchronous transfer mode networks?  :-)

Lottery cards are not up to scratch, By Ben Fenton <BR>
From the Electronic Telegraph
<P>
A computer fault forced the National Lottery to suspend its new Instants
scratchcard game last night, a few hours after it was launched at a
glittering party in Regent's Park, London.  
<P>
Mr Peter Davis, the director general of the lottery, said that Camelot,
which runs it, was "making every effort" to find a solution as quickly as
possible.  He instructed Camelot to place advertisements in all daily
national and key regional newspapers today to reassure customers and said it
was vital that players were kept fully informed and their interests
protected.  He said: "Members of the public who have purchased Instants
tickets can be assured that all valid prize claims will be met as soon as
possible." Any player who had bought a winning ticket should keep it safe.
<P>
The trouble began even before sports and show business personalities and the
Red Devils parachute team officially launched the scratchcard scheme in the
sunshine at Regent's Park.  Thousands of newsagents, service stations and
grocers trying to sell the cards found the discouraging message "Function
Suppressed" when they attempted to validate them by computer.
<P>
Apart from a handful bought around 7am, nobody was able to buy the #1
scratchcards and try for an immediate prize of between #1 and #50,000.
<P>
The scratchcards are due to be on sale at 20,000 outlets. To use them,
customers rub the card to reveal six cash figures and, if three of them
match, they win that amount.
<P>
Weekly lottery tickets are not affected by the fault.

And what if someone spoofs the farmer's IP address to take control of the
tractor?  Will the farmer be required to hire a security expert to install a
firewall on both systems and make sure the tractor is running the most
recent version of sendmail?  Will the tractor shut off by mistake because
its Pentium CPU had a floating-point error?
<P>
Then what about the livestock?  Will Bessie's cowbell be replaced with her
own GPS system?  Will she have to carry a satellite dish on her head?  (Will
the farmer?)

Come to think of it, GPS would be a good way for Little Bo Peep to keep

Eric Raymond, suggests that the same mechanisms that let organisms evolve to
be resistant to plagues, evolution, will allow us to evolve to a point where
we can manage the changes brought about by technological change.  I suggest
that he consider the time-constants involved.  Evolution in human beings is
best measured on a scale of centuries.  Evolution in our technology is best

I think Eric Raymond (<A HREF="mailto:esr@netaxs.com">esr@netaxs.com</A>) is being a bit too sanguine about the
risks of memetic garbage, when he suggests that we think of it as evolution
in action. First of all, if enough garbage is being transmitted--whether by
computer nets or radio hardly matters, for this purpose--it may overwhelm
the desired or needed information, for everyone.  Second, it may be called
"evolution in action" if someone listens to a fanatic preacher and decides
to make a suicide attack on something they disapprove of: but to call that
"evolution" from the point of view of the victims of that attack does little
but allow us not to think too much about what has happened. Third, from a
purely evolutionary standpoint, if we are to take one, I would far rather
evolve or invent a defense mechanism against such garbage--ideally one that
would protect me from other people who take it too seriously--than just
dismiss it and hope that I get lucky.

Um, aren't all floating point operations are performed using exclusively

TeX, if a program does its own floating-point emulation (assume that the

 |I conten[d] that this behavior *is* a bug.  The proof is in the public's<BR>
 |reaction to finding bits of "their" files in the Prodigy cache area.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
No, I don't think so. There is at least a nomenclatural difference between a
"bug" -- software that fails to perform as designed -- and a "design flaw"
-- software that doesn't do what it perhaps ought to, but does do what it
was intended to do. If you want to argue that Prodigy's coders should have
realized that not wiping their pre-allocated disk space was a Bad Thing,
well, maybe. But it's not a bug, because they probably did it that way on
purpose.
<P>
You see, it is a perfectly normal thing in MS-DOS application coding to
create a large file without initializing its contents when the program knows
how big a file it needs before it knows exactly what it will put in it.
Prodigy's MS-DOS client software is far from the only well-known program to
use this technique. Because they are an on-line service, though, when
someone noticed some "deleted" data in a Prodigy file, there was an
immediate assumption on the part of ill-informed users that Prodigy's
software was spying on them.
<P>
One point that has never been quite clear to me about this case -- I've
heard both positive and negative answers, and therefore remain confused --
is whether this uninitialized file was ever transmitted to Prodigy. If not,
then this whole controversy is utterly nonsensical, since no "violation of
privacy" can possibly occur. If it is transmitted, however, then I would
definitely agree that Prodigy should have wiped the file when they created
it. It is one thing to have "deleted" data that you ignore sitting in a
sector that just happens to be allocated to your file; that's a perfectly
normal thing to have happen, and it happens to nearly ALL files, since there
is usually some slack space between the logical end of a file and the end of
the final disk cluster allocated to that file. It is quite another thing,
though, to transmit that data to another system without the user's knowledge
and consent.
<BLOCKQUOTE>

Depending on the size of the file and the year in which the software was
originally written, we may be talking about much more than "a few seconds".

&gt;Given the prevalence of Unix (aka broken) mail forwarders out there<BR>
&gt;that believe any occurrence of "From" at the beginning of a line can<BR>
&gt;be "wedged" as
</BLOCKQUOTE>
That's the way things are *supposed* to work.  However, it's a fact that many
messages have their From's wedged in transit.  In fact, it happened with the
sample "From" in my RISKS posting as it arrived here.
<P>
One cause I have been able to track down is the use of final delivery agents
as forwarding agents.  It's apparently a fairly common trick to allow "final
delivery" to go to an address that really feeds into a pipe to a program that
forwards the message onward.  Alternatively, some systems implement store-and-
forward mailers by using a standard local delivery agent to place stuff into
a file that is then later read and forwarded.
<P>
In both of these cases, a properly written forwarding agent to unwedge the
Froms (though since the convention says nothing about lines that start with
"&gt;From " to begin with, it could not do so with 100% reliability).  It's a
fact that many don't.  To give one specific example:  PSI, one of the largest
commercial Internet providers in the US, wedges Froms on mail it forwards to
a subscriber (me).  By experimentation, I've determined that some of their
nodes do wedge Froms, while others don't.  At one time, I tried to get PSI
to fix the problem.  I got nowhere; they denied any problem existed.  See the
Unix Hater's Handbook for a copy of their final response to me.  (The editors
of the UHH decided to leave out PSI's name.  I see no reason to do so.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&gt;headers -- beware!  Any "From:" lines you include are likely<BR>
&gt;Moosebait!
<P>
Most Unix mail delivery agents escape "From ", but not "From:".
</BLOCKQUOTE>
You same "most".  Have you counted?  Besides, the issue is whether you can
rely on the mail system not to do this.  You can't.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&gt;Oh, yes, there are also some mail forwarders out there that will<BR>
&gt;change any line consisting only of a single "." to one containing<BR>
&gt;"..".  There are no doubt some that will make the reverse<BR>
&gt;substitution.  There also appear to be
<P>
This is used by mail and news forwarders.  In particular SMTP as used
by me to submit this message and NNTP as used by me to receive it the
first place.  There is some broken SMTP and NNTP software, but all
that that I have seen is MS-DOS and Windows.  Unless you are on a UUCP
site and only take news and mail from UUCP sites through pure UUCP
paths, it is almost certain that the double dot encoding has been done
on it.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
What's your point?  Do you think that a message containing a line with a
single dot on it can legally be delivered with two dots?  The RFC's specify
how to do dot-encoding, and if you implement it correctly, it's a transparent
encoding that exists only while the message is in transit between two systems.
<P>
The fact is, there are sites out there that implement it incorrectly.  I'll
again point to PSI.  By experimentation, I was able to determine that some of
their inter-machine links double dots and don't undouble them.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&gt;gateways around that will replace empty lines with lines containing a<BR>

This does exist as a problem, although not generally with Unix, but

Agreed; this seems mainly to be IBM gateways.

You mean quoted-printable.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Yes.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&gt;in the midst of otherwise simple ASCII text - you'll see things like<BR>
&gt;=20 at the end of a line.
<P>
One reason for doing this is to get round software which truncates
trailing spaces - that's why trailing spaces get encoded, but the
trigger for doing  this is normally a single non-ASCII character, or a
mail client which falsely declares everything to be 8 bit ISO 8859-1.
Generally I would always suspect client software before transport
software.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
I have no idea what software is doing this.  All I can see is the messages as
they arrive here.  I know what software I'm running, and I know what it does
to the bodies of messages (nothing at all).  In some cases, I've tracked down
who out there is damaging messages; in other cases, I haven't bothered to
spend the time on a thankless task.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&gt;I suppose the underlying idea here is fine, but unfortunately an<BR>
&gt;attempt to build such a thing on top of the very chaotic and<BR>
&gt;unpredictable world of today's mail systems is to impose many<BR>
&gt;non-obvious risks on users.
<P>
Read the MIME RFCs for discussion on transparency issues.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Why should I care what the MIME RFC's have to say?  I'm neither sending nor
receiving MIME mail; most people on the net are neither sending nor receiving
MIME mail; and the original posting proposed to cancel *all* messages that
failed a signature test, not just those that were MIME-encoded.  (A good
thing, since MIME-encoded messages are a small minority.)
<P>
The original RFC's are, in fact, decently written and provide for proper
transparent transport of 7-bit ASCII (8-bit ASCII was a rarity at the time
and wasn't considered).  For that matter, the UUCP specs (such as they are)
do, too.  The fact of the matter is that there seem to be more incorrect
implementations of the RFC's out there than correct ones.
<P>
The Unix community has been particularly egregious in its attitude that if
the specs disagree with widely-distributed Unix programs, then it's the
specs that are wrong.  In some cases - sendmail is the famous one - it's not
even that the Unix programs are wrong, it's that they are so complex to
configure that most complete *systems* using them are set up to violate the
RFC's, even if in principle they could have been set up correctly.
<P>
What programs could, in principle, do is of no importance:  The mail system
infrastructure is built of what the systems out there actually do, not what
they could potentially do - and what they actually do is a mess.

We don't KNOW if FBOI has bad intentions, and we should be careful of

such as these, and, if they can get away with charges totalling 10%, then
clearly there is legitimate money to be made.  But we should be mindful of

Rob Slade also raised questions about the cryptographic software, although
freely available outside the US, it had (has ?) a non-commercial use clause.

		 NCSA httpd Patch for Buffer Overflow
<P>
A vulnerability was recently discovered in the NCSA httpd. A program which
will break into an HP system running the precompiled httpd has been
published, along with step by step instructions. The program overflows a
buffer into program space which then gets executed.
<P>
If you are running a precompiled NCSA httpd, please ftp a new copy of the
binary. If you have compiled your own source code, we recommend applying the
following Patch to fix the vulnerability in the NCSA HTTP Daemon V.1.3 for
UNIX. It modifies the strsubfirst subroutine in util.c.
<P>
We believe that earlier versions of the server are vulnerable to a similar
attack, and strsubfirst should be modified for all releases of the server.
<P>
Cert Advisory CA-95:04 describes the problem and includes two suggested
steps.  We do not recommend taking step 1, which increases MAX_STRING_LEN to
8192.  There are 154 occurrences of variables using MAX_STRING_LEN and
changing them from 256 to 8192 bytes is going to expand the memory needed to
run httpd tremendously! On top of that, httpd forks a new process (a
complete copy of the parent) for each connection, which if your site gets
hit a lot will use unnecessarily large amounts of memory. We have already
had reports from admins who have made the change saying they are
experiencing performance degradation due to swapping. Step 2, applying the
patch to util.c, should be sufficient to fix the problem. There is
significantly less forking in Release 1.4 of the NCSA HTTP Daemon which will
be released soon.

If the access log contains control characters, there is a chance that
someone has tried to break into your system. If your server has died
recently, they failed at least one attempt. And, if your server has not
crashed and there are control characters in the access log you should assume
your system has been compromised.
<P>
In this case, servers which currently use the User Directive to run the
server as "nobody", have limited the potential damage of an intruder to
those commands which "nobody" may execute.

<H5>Control Characters in the Access Log</H5>

You've discovered control characters in your access log. How do you tell if was
an intruder?
<P>
If the beginning of the line containing the control characters begins
sensibly (eg. machine name, and date (the GET periodically gets clobbered))
and ends with a series of control characters, it is a break-in attempt. If
the beginning of the line starts with control characters (often nulls), this
is a symptom of a collision problem that occurs when two children try to
write to the access log simultaneously. This problem has only been seen with
moderately to heavily loaded servers. (We are working to fix this in Release
1.4.)
<H5>Other ways to Make Your Server More Secure</H5>

A tutorial about running a secure server is available. We also recommend that
the User Directive be used to run the server as "nobody".

<H5>Patched Source and Binaries</H5>

The patched source and precompiled binaries are available. We will also be
correcting the source for previous releases, but we will NOT be generating
binaries for previous releases.

The critique of the First Bank of the Internet is the germ of a good idea -
why not review new businesses? (more or less as people referee scientific
journal articles - then potential investors can weed out the con-merchants
BEFORE they create another notorious scam).
<P>
I think the Internet will need such a service soon, to cancel out all the
gee-whizz proposals flying around which intend to make money out of doing
exactly the reverse - keeping people UNinformed. I suppose you could describe
it as a CERT at the application rather than the network layer.
<P>
The RISK? - you only need to see how the previous Internet authorities were
lambasted as they became more bureaucratic to realise that anyone employed
in refereeing will be attacked as More Fascist Than Adolf Hitler and of
course in breach of The Spirit Of The Free Market and The American Way Of
Life.  I have already used information from a Usenet news group on
Multi-Level Marketing (which is NOT pyramid selling.. honest) to inform
someone who was being pushed into representing AmWay - I don't know how much
use it was, but he couldn't pretend he was not informed of the cost of doing
it.

<P>
In <A HREF="/Risks/16.93.html">RISKS-16.93</A>, an advert for the `First Bank of Internet' said, of its
VISA ATM card:
<P>
&gt; The card is prepaid, PIN protected, replaceable, disposable, and good <BR>
&gt; at over 200,000 Visa/PLUS (tm) ATMs in 83 countries.  <BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; The safety of FBOI is ensured because access to ATM funds without <BR>
&gt; possession of both the ATM card and the Personal Identification Number<BR> 
&gt; (PIN) is not possible.
<P>
ATM security breaks down in many ways - see for example `Why Cryptosystems
Fail' at ftp.cl.cam.ac.uk:/users/rja14/wcf.ps.Z, which documents a number of
incidents. Many of these have been reported in comp.risks over the last few
years.
<P>
A bank which shows itself to be unaware of risks which are well known to 
readers of this column does not serve itself well by advertising here,

Contending for software screw-up of the year, Intuit Inc., publishers of
Macintax, have copped to yet another flaw in their tax reporting software.
According to an article by Peter Lewis in The New York Times, 24 Mar 1995,
information [password, phone number] included in a Macintax debug file that
came with the standard distribution disks of the product enabled users to
log into the master computer used by Intuit to store and file Macintax
user's returns.
<P>
Once logged into the master computer, a user could reportedly download,
modify or delete other people's returns. The offending information was a
login ID and password for Intuit's master computer that was apparently
included in a debug file in plain text! The security hole was reported by an
unidentified user in E-mail to the NYT. Once Intuit was made aware of the
screwup they reportedly corrected it, but could give no assurances that any
of the 60,000 tax returns in the master computer hadn't been compromised.
<P>
Encryption is not used in the Intuit's product [but was intended to be].

<I>Fri, 24 Mar 1995 13:06:58 -0500</I><P>

[A _Washington Post_ article on 24 Mar 1995] reported that Intuit learned of
the problem "yesterday" (apparently Thursday, 23 March) from a customer's
call; according to the customer, he had been able to log onto the Unix
account and peruse the files there.
<P>
Also according to Intuit, the UNIX account is used only as a staging area,
and is swept to some other facility every eight hours.  Mark Goins (Intuit
VP of personal tax group) says that no more than 300 returns are in the
account at any time.
<P>
A rather scary bit of spin control by Intuit is reported in the article:
it quotes Bob Barr (identified as "vice-president of electronic services"
at Intuit) as downplaying the exposure:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    If a curious customer programmed his or her computer
    to dial up the number and supplied the password [from the
    plaintext file], they would have entry to the database 
    holding the files.  Even so, Barr said, the person would
    have to have some familiarity with a computer programming
    language called UNIX [sic!], which is commonly used on the
    Internet, to peruse or alter any files.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
as if knowing how to use UNIX commands is so rare a skill that its
use offers security.  It is, of course, possible that the reporter
mangled Barr's comment, but readers of RISKS-FORUM are all too
familiar with what can be done by someone who gets unauthorized access
to sensitive data.
<P>
This has definitely *not* been a particularly good year for Intuit.

"Gibberish puts searchers off the scent", New Scientist, 25 February 1995: 
<P>
[Companies use professional patent searchers to determine the existence of
patents covering a particular subject and thus avoid later legal problems.
However, the electronic patent indexes contain errors which may give false
results in searches.]

  In the European Patent Office's index, for example, he found an organic
  compound in the phthylenone group which is indexed as an "ogthylene-3-one"
  -probably because the typists hand had slipped one key along the keyboard.
  [...]  Most mysterious of all, Steele [a professional patent searcher] found
  entries in the EPO's international Inpadoc database for patent applicants
  called Robaato Uiraaton Furemingu, Uiriamu Bii Reisufuiirudo, Bii Oo Shii
  Guruupu and Kuringe Fuarama.
<P>
  By digging out other patents with cross-indexed numbers, Steele decoded
  the names as Robert Willerton Fleming, William B. Laceford, the BOC Group
  and Klinge Pharma.
<P>
  Inpadoc's headquarters in Vienna automatically collates data from computer
  tapes supplied by 56 patent offices around the world. The Japanese tapes
  contain names which have been translated from Western originals into
  pictorial characters and back again by computer. The result is often
  gibberish, and there is no provision for human checking.'

[Obviously the potential legal problems arising from a faulty index could
have serious financial consequences. It also leaves the possibility of a
patent office awarding two patents for the same invention to different
people if the first patent submitted is mis-indexed.]

<P>
    Sun will be releasing a new Web browser next week that does more than
    download pictures and text that just sits there.  A demo showed a
    financial planning application with a ticker of selected stocks scrolling
    across the screen with up-to-the-minute quotes.

    The Hot Java browser downloads small software programs, which

My immediate reaction was: this is a bad thing unless the client browser
runs the downloaded program in an interpreter that has very limited
capabilities.  Otherwise a fancy-looking Web page may be sending the

On the 25 March Beakman's World, a young people's "science" show on CBS,
they answered a viewer's question about how video games work by showing 
how to write a simple program.  They finished program was as follows:
<P>
IF liza hits the button<BR>
THEN Lester picks up ball<BR>
THEN Lester throws the ball<BR>
AT TARGET
<P>
This program was not written correctly at first.  The first bug was that the 
programmer, Liza, forgot the line "THEN Lester 
picks up ball", so the giant lab rat threw his arm with no projectile.
This corrected, she tried again having neglected to specify "AT TARGET", 
leaving the pitcher to throw in all directions but that desired.
<P>
As a result, young budding (unemployed) computer programmers were exposed 
to the concept of risk in the case of incomplete system development.

Subject: A slight change in flight plan
<P>
The BBC news at 08.30 reported a slight problem which occurred on the
morning of 15 Mar 1995 with the ultra high-tech, packed full of software and
therefore utterly wonderful Airbus A340.
<P>
Apparently on the final part of its approach to Gatwick, both the pilots
screens went blank, to be replaced by a polite little message saying "Please
wait ...".  Somewhat unnerved, the pilots requested that the plane turn
left, but it turned right instead.  They then tried to get it to adopt a 3
degree approach to the runway, but it chose a 9 degree plummet instead.  At
this point, from the report, they appeared to gain manual control and landed
safely.  It is not clear who will pick up the dry-cleaning bill.

Since yesterday a new 'open border' regulation is in power in the
so-called Schengen countries. These comprise, as I believe, Belgium,
the Netherlands, Germany and France.
 <P>
With this open border thing, it is not necessary to have a passport
or other ID anymore when crossing a border between this group of countries.
 <P>
There is a check built in of course: on checking in, one gets a paper card
with a magnetic strip, this strip containing no personal information, but
only a date and time.
 <P>
On arrival in the other country, one can straight pass through a turnstile,
without any ID being checked. ID checks are allowed though.
 <P>
Anyway, in case of loss of this card, one can present his or her passport
and get in.
 <P>
It seems at least some people have already used another persons paper
card to get into a country.
 <P>
For this reason Paris still has the passport check, even though they
are supposed not to.

I wonder how anyone, even politicians, can come up with such a buggy system.

Ry Jones &lt;<A HREF="mailto:ry.jones@mccaw.com">ry.jones@mccaw.com</A>&gt; reported an unspecified study and personal
experience as argument in favor of "standard" interfaces for medical
equipment.  It is not controversial that such "standards" would be a good
idea, most of the discussion of designing and implementing such standards
amounts to Mom-and-apple-pie type statements.  Indeed, I have been critical
(Cook et al., Evaluating the Human Engineering of Microprocessor Controlled
Operating Room Devices, Journal of Clinical Monitoring 7:217-226,1991) of
attempts to introduce human engineering guidelines for medical equipment
because such guidelines necessarily represent a least- common-denominator
approach an end up ignoring the real cognitive consequences of using
microprocessor based technology.  Indeed, successful standards (e.g. the
ASTM's standard for the color and type on user applied drug labels for
syringes used during anesthesia, the ANSI standards for anesthesia machine
layout, color and pin index coding of gas lines, etc.) are nearly all
related to narrow mechanical issues and represent the rather stable
consensus of manufacturers and users regarding a very limited range of
issues.
<P>
To claim that a certain improvement in human performance would be achieved
by the production of a certain sort of standardization is assuredly untrue.
As indicated above, it is nearly impossible to produce such standards.  More
importantly, the claim that a certain benefit can be obtained is simply weak
counterfactual reasoning; it assumes that performance is derived from narrow
limitations and that these can readily be overcome for all practitioners.
There is, to my knowledge, no reliable or persuasive data suggesting that
this is true in any real sense.  Even in similarly complex, high consequence
domains (e.g. commercial aviation, military systems, nuclear power plant
operations) where efforts to produce such improvements have been intense and
sustained there are virtually no credible studies indicating quantity of
benefit derived from such standardization.
<P>
Many people who have only peripheral exposure to medicine are amazed at the
technological complexity of current practice.  It is clear that devices pose
a problem for operators, in part because they are poorly designed and poorly
manufactured (cf. Cook, et al., Unintentional Delivery of Vasoactive Drugs
With and Electromechanical Infusion Device.  Journal of Cardiothoracic and
Vascular Anesthesia 6: 238-244, 1992, Cook &amp; Woods, Adapting to New
Technology in the Operating Room, in press) defining precisely how they are
bad demands detailed knowledge of the cognitive consequences of aspects of
their design which, in turn, requires detailed understanding of the
cognitive tasks of their users.  It is far from easy to produce adequate
guidance for the development of devices or for their evaluation, although
the FDA is interested in doing so.
<P>
The nature of the problem with infusion devices and their programming is
actually quite common and the problems associated with their use are many.
What is remarkable, for those of us who study these issues, is that human
practitioners are able to make these devices work despite the variety of
circumstances and limitations under which they are employed.  Most pumps
reflect a narrow balance between competing demands on designers.  I have a
nice figure that will be in a paper to be published late this year on the
subject.  Briefly, there is competition between capability of the device,
the complexity introduced by managing capability, and engineering issues,
especially power budget and display cost.  The risks of infusions are too
numerous to list here but one problem is the consequence of a mechanical
infusion into a non-intravascular space.  IV catheters can become
"infiltrated" in which case the infusion is no longer intravenous but
subcutaneous (or intramuscular, etc.) with associated consequences.  The use
of gravity to drive fluids sets and upper limit on applied pressure and
hence on the likely consequences of infiltration: in most cases, an
infiltrated IV simply stops running and is replaced.  Resistance to fluid
flow, however, follows Poiseuille's law and is proportional to the fourth
power of the radius.  Thus flows through small IVs are limited and higher
pressures are needed and a pump may be used, although the risk of forcing
fluid into an infiltrated IV is now present.  Pumps are designed with
various control parameters, including the maximum permissible pressure
applied to the fluid and this value is (for some) programmable.  It is quite
possible to have an undesirable set of circumstances when infusing fluids
under pressure (e.g. the mass effect of a liter of fluid in the subcutaneous
space of the arm can cause vascular compromise and subsequent tissue loss,
some drugs are toxic to tissue and must be diluted by high blood flow and
infusion of these into the non-vascular space can cause limb loss, etc. etc
etc.) so pump manufacturers are understandably chary of these settings and
many pumps have elaborate programming requirements.  The point is that
resolving these sorts of problems is non-trivial.
<P>
The notion of "standard" for everything is superficially attractive, but
most often the desire reflects a form of magical, wishful thinking: if
things were simple there wouldn't be a problem so our task is to make them
simple.  But things are complicated because the world is complicated and we
are doing complicated things.  Indeed, I would argue (see first ref.
above), that much of the problem we have with medical devices is the result
of designers attempting to produce a device surface that _appears_ simple
but actually hides a wealth of complexity.  I sometimes call this the "thin,
thin, thin computer candy shell" that hides the device from the user.
Unfortunately, the user is still responsible for the operation of the device
and (see 2nd ref) for diagnosing device failures.  This problem is not
addressed by standards or guidelines but rather by a prudent and detailed
approach to design (viz. Norman's books, Rasmussen's books, etc.).

Incorrect use of IV pumps in hospitals can be much more serious than the
different needle sizes recently mentioned by Ry Jones.  To permit patients
to get pain relief without waiting for the nurses there are devices known as
PCAs (Patient Controlled Administration).  These are computer controlled
infusers which are piggy-backed onto an IV line.  They can be programmed to
deliver a certain continuous dosage and to permit the patient to press a
button for additional pain reliever in specified amounts at specified
intervals.  This should permit them to insure that no more than a prescribed
dose is given during any time interval.  These devices also record a history
log which can be used to determine how often the patient is demanding the
drug.  And the front panel locks to prevent the patient from modifying the
dosage.
<P>
The (semi-)standardized interface to these is that all analgesics must
come in 30 ml syringes in order to fit the pump mechanism.  The
problem with this is that different analgesics come in different
concentrations.  Demerol comes as 10 mg/ml, but morphine is 1 mg/ml,
etc.  The PCA interface requires the dosages to be specified in mg per
unit time, but the PCA itself can only measure ml, so in addition to
all the dosage information the nurse must also tell the PCA what is
the concentration of the drug in the syringe.
<P>
Recently I witnessed an incident where an entire day's worth of
Demerol was infused in 2 hours.  After administering an antidote, two
nurses tried to figure out what had gone wrong.  One of them explained
to the other that the programmed concentration had been 1 mg/ml
instead of 10 mg/ml, so the PCA had delivered the drug 10 times faster
than prescribed in order to satisfy its instructions.  The RISKS of
this are pretty obvious.

&gt; But the error probably wouldn't have existed in the first place<BR>
&gt; if the conversion code had been written with floating point instead<BR> 
&gt; of integer arithmetic.
<P>
Excuse me?  I hate to climb on my soapbox again, but this shows a remarkable
misunderstanding of both floating-point (in)accuracy and date conversion.
Dates as measured by computers are inherently integers, and thus should
*never* be manipulated using floating-point code.  If you're representing
down to seconds, you can fit nearly 70 years into 32 bits (cf. Unix).  If
you need more than that, it's very easy to use a 64-bit representation, and
convert it to two 32-bit quantities (such as julian date plus seconds within
year) early in the manipulation, even if your computer doesn't support
64-bit arithmetic.  If you need high resolution (e.g., nanoseconds) you
might need to use 96 bits, but it's still trivial to break things down into
quantities that are easily handled.  I'll agree that the 48-bit manipulation
in assembly was probably convoluted, but floating-point is not the proper
solution.  It makes me shudder.

The papers are reporting that potential disaster has been averted in the
Canadian financial community.  5200 disks containing information on the
Canadian Federal Budget were pulled, only hours before they were due to be
shipped, when a virus was discovered on them.  ThunderByte Scan is being
credited, since the master disk was allegedly checked twice before leaving
the Finance Department, and ThunderByte is an "advanced" antiviral product.
<P>
There are, however, a few questions to be answered.  How come nobody checked
*before* they made 5200 copies?  Is it possible that the duplication machine
was infected?  (Unlikely: duplicators usually have specialized equipment.
But possible.)  And, what virus was found?
<P>
Ah, this last is the cruncher.  Nobody has said what virus it was, yet lots
of people are saying that computers across the country could have been shut
down.  In actual fact, nobody *knows* what virus was found.  The closest
report I have been able to get from a knowledgeable source (and that source
is none to close) reports that ThunderByte reported an *unknown* boot sector
infector.  (Remember, ThunderByte is an "advanced" antiviral.  It uses
heuristics.  It's guessing.)  It is possible that ThunderByte has detected a
new, and previously unknown, virus.
<P>
It is also possible that there is no virus at all.
#<P>
It is very likely that we never will know whether there was a virus or not.
Although press reports indicate that the RCMP is investigating, a lot of
other people appear to have done their own investigations first.  Thus, if
the disks *are* found to be infected, who knows *where* they got infected.

In response to your query, we wish to inform you that Bill Gates will
announce later today that Microsoft has entered into an arrangement with
Native American Virtual Activities to develop a computerized casino that
will be accessible on the Internet as well as by dial-ups, with a toll-free
800 number for U.S. patrons.  User-supportive software will be bundled at no
extra cost within Windows 95.  During April, further software will be added
compatibly to Bob, Microsoft's new user-friendly empowerment package --
which was officially released yesterday.  Bob will even be able to analyze
your gambling habits and prompt you if you do something stupid.
<P>
Microsoft has struck a deal with the National Security Agency under which
good crypto (80-bit SKIPJACK, implemented in software) can be used
internationally.  The deal involves export controls being waived in return
for NSA getting a 1.5% share of the profits, the crypto keys being escrowed
by yet-to-be-named agencies of the U.S. Government (insiders suggest
Treasury and the FBI), and Microsoft promising to keep the crypto from
falling into the hands of undesirable elements such as organized crime.  
PGP will be used to envelope the electronic communications, and its creator
Philip Zimmermann will be on the governing board of NAVA, along with Bill
Gates, Richard Stallman of the Free Software Foundation, and Steven
Spielberg on behalf of DreamWorks SKG.
<P>
Conservative projections indicate that this will be enormously profitable
for all concerned, including the U.S. Government -- which will
instantaneously receive withheld taxes on all winnings via Internet
electronic funds transfer, based on the use of a valid Social Security
Number.  Special extended social-security numbers will be allocated for
foreign individuals who wish to participate from abroad, although they will
generally be subject to a nonrefundable U.S. tax.  Cooperation with tax
agencies of foreign governments is anticipated.  The newly reconstituted
Bureau of Wish and Game will oversee the operation.
<P>
The virtual casino will be operated onshore from specially dedicated Indian
lands that are not under state or Federal jurisdiction.  However, the
operation is expected to be so lucrative that it will voluntarily contribute
taxes to the two states that will house the geographically dispersed
interoperating computer systems designed to ensure very high system
availability.  For those states in which gambling is illegal, remote
services will be provided so that the activities can legally be conducted
remotely from another state, such as Nevada or New Jersey.  It is likely
that states currently banning gambling will be incentivized to change their
laws by the standing offer of tax revenues collected from bettors in their
home states.  Several banking institutions have already expressed interest
in extending their automatic teller-machine functionality, trying to preempt
competition from the Internet-compatible First Bank of Internet Visa (TM)
ATM cards.  Overall, this operation has the potential to completely
eliminate national and state deficits.
<P>
Despite the security and integrity risks raised in a recent article by John
Markoff of The New York Times, and some concerns about the socially
regressive and antidisestablishmentarian consequences of gambling, there
seems to be little opposition to this remarkable confluence of usually
disparate interests -- other than from its would-be competitors, Virtual
Vegas, the already existing free Internet casino operated from Santa Monica,
Calif., and the Online Offshore Casino and Sports Book -- which is expected
to open for business next month in the Bahamas.

Risks of being the Cool Site of the Day: (<A HREF="http://www.infi.net/cool.html">http://www.infi.net/cool.html</A>)
<P>
Have you read Alfred Bester's "The Stars My Destination".
<P>
I just read the Cool Site of the Day FAQ
(<A HREF="http://www.infi.net/CSotDFAQ.html">http://www.infi.net/CSotDFAQ.html</A>) and I found that the sections on<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

  "What should I do if I'm selected and I find that my site cannot handle
   the lads involved?" (replace your cool page with a text only page), and<BR>
  "Why would I want my site to be a CSotD" (it's the exposure) 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
parallel the problems described as "jack jaunting".
<P>
In the Stars My Destination, people found they could teleport (jaunte) at
will with proper mental focus (What's your URL?).  They lived in a world
with almost infinitely quick dissemination of information about current
events (Netnews, Websites, and CNN).
<P>
One result was that when a "cool site" became known, it would become flooded
with vast numbers of jaunters from around the world.  Many of these jaunters
were malicious and used the cover of the millions of other people to
perpetrate crimes.  For instance, if a fire were televised (today I heard
that the Fulton Seafood Market is burning down) thousands of people would
jaunte in to be tourists.  Some of the people would use the opportunity to
pillage.
<P>
The parallels between the CSotD and Jack Jaunting break down here, because
there is no overtly malicious motive, but there is the likelihood of a
Denial of Service Attack.
<P>
It's interesting.  You want to be a Cool Site.  I want to know of the Cool
Sites.  Being a Known Cool Site may lead to your demise as a Cool Site.
<P>
There's nothing new here, this is exactly the same problem as that known as
the "Restaurant Review Effect", but it is interesting to see how real life
is being recreated in cyberspace.

objected to me posting rumors, but there are some folks who will talk only
on the condition of anonymity, wanting to keep their jobs...
<P>
From Computerwoche 12, 24.March1995, page 27<BR>
(in German, translation mine, all translation errors mine)
<P>
CW-report by Walter Mehl (Hamburg)<BR>
"Siemens computer stops switching system (Stellwerk) in Hamburg"
&gt;From Monday to Wednesday last week all signals at the train station in
Hamburg-Altona were on stop. [Must be more, I travelled from Hamburg on
Friday and waited an hour because of "computer problems"] Just like it was
when track was first invented, the switches could be set only by using a
crowbar-sized key to shove them into position. The fault was with a computer
from the company Siemens, that had gone on-line the day before.
<P>
The train station in Altona is home to pigeons and seagulls. They had 3
days of peace and quiet while scavenging for food between the tracks and
sleeping on the catenaries. Since the morning of 13 March, nothing works
anymore in the digital switching station: the main computer from Siemens
quit after an error in the main memory occurred.
<P>
[couple of paragraphs about all the bother people had to go to to get
where they wanted to go]
<P>
... as we go to print it is not clear if the Deutsche Bahn will demand
money back from Siemens.
<P>
The Bahn was extremely proud of its new digital helper - in their own
publication "Der Zug" they had a long article about it. The new technology
cost 62.6 million DM (about 45 million $), Siemens pocketed about 2/3 of
that sum. The Siemens computer replaced 8 conventional switching systems,
which were installed between 1911 and 1952. They controlled all the 
switches and signals in the station area. In fail-safe mode all signals are
red and the switches can be set only by hand.
<P>
In Altona Siemens first [!!!] used the Simis-3216-computer which uses an
Intel 486 chip. Siemens makes these system extremely robust: they can take
temperatures between -40 and +85 degrees Celsius and can withstand up to 5
times the earths acceleration in force. Not even a signal with 2000 Volt can
influence the running of the system. For security reasons they are run in a
2-out-of-three mode, there are 3 identical computers on site, each could
work alone. 2 are constantly running in parallel, so that if something goes
wrong the replacement one can be switched on immediately, the normal working
of the system is given in just a few minutes. When the system is working
normally, each of the two computers control each other, and when both
determine the same result, then the switch or signal are thrown.
<P>
It was determined that the cause was not a hardware problem. The system
software was working properly. The shutdown was traced to a design problem:
the main memory was too small, it was not sufficient when there were too
many events (=trains) and switches. [the rumor mill says it was a stack
overflow - would you believe dynamic data structures in a safety-critical
system?! The "fix" was to be another half a meg of memory to be on the safe
side...]. This critical point was reached in normal ruch hour traffic.  The
computer [sic, there must be more than one, however!] couldn't work any more
and shut itself down.
<P>
It took 2 days for the Siemens technicians in the Test Center in 
Braunschweig to reconstruct and analyse the situation. The computers were
running again at 5am on Wednesday morning, and from 2pm everything was
running smoothly again. [like I say, Friday it was broken again]

When the movie industry was faced with government censorship and regulation,
they joined forces and adopted a voluntary rating system that classified the
maturity level needed to understand a movie. Such a system could work well
for the net because it could, like netiquette, spread beyond national
borders. Plus it might forestall strong arm laws like the Exon bill which
just passed the Senate.
<P>
Here's how it could work. Every person or company that places a WWW page on
the network could "rate" the contents of the page by placing it an
appropriate directory. A page from my collection of pages might have a URL
like:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <A HREF="http://access.digex.net:/~pcw/over13/deepkiss.html">http://access.digex.net:/~pcw/over13/deepkiss.html</A>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The directory with the name "over13" indicates that the material in the page
"deepkiss.html" might not be appropriate for someone under 13 years old.  I
imagine four major ratings like "over0" which is open to all, "over13" and
"over17" which contain greater indication that two people can do more than
talk to each other with their clothes on, and "over21" which is open to
everything.
<P>
How would this stop anyone? Kids can still type. Yes, but each WWW browser
could be programmed to avoid pages with certain ratings. Parents with young
children could place one of these controlled browsers on their computer and
be sure that their kids couldn't read rated pages. These browsers for
children could also exclude all pages without explicit ratings. This would
allow parents to keep their children away from any material that was not
explicitly cleared for all ages.
<UL>
<LI>Would this system work? The people on the Network already show a good
 attitude for cooperation. Aside from few bold examples, most people carefully
 follow the rules of netiquette. There is hardly any reason not to cooperate--
 the cost is only a few seconds of time and a few kilobytes of diskspace.
<P>
<LI>What about different cultural norms? This system offers a direct incentive to
 classify material conservatively. People will rate their pages because they
 want to be polite and sensitive to other cultures throughout the world. Not
 because they fear the police. They are not censored, they are just providing
 other people a chance to avoid potentially offensive material.
<P>
<LI>Wouldn't people lie? Sure. There are always people who break rules. But they
 could be punished by social pressure. A service provider might hesitate to
 "censor" the Web pages of its customers because it believes in free expression.
 But a service provider could ask its customers to rate web pages because it
 is the polite thing to do.
<P>
<LI>Why is this better than the Exon law? Legal measures must always be liberal
 because the loser goes to jail or pays a fine. This is why we require
 evidence and the costs of a jury trial. Social systems like this
 can err on the conservative side. Nudists might not understand why the
 rest of the world wears clothes, but they can rate their web page
 "over21" for little cost.
<P>
 Imagine the cost of prosecuting a nudist camp's web page for simply
 being on the Net. The Nudists who might be from a liberal region like
 California could decide to fight on principle. The trial would be
 a battle of experts trying to pin down "community standards" on
 a place like the Net. The Nudists would be broken financially. The
 local district would lose out because the court would be too jammed
 to prosecute normal criminals.
<P>
 The NetRate system saves costs and accomplishes more! Legal systems
 let the grey zone live. Social systems can restrict the grey zone
 without stopping it.
</UL>
If anyone has any suggestions or comments, I would like to hear them. I
think this system is technically simple, politically possible and something
that promotes greater understanding of people throughout the world. I am
working on a rating system that would encompass the thoughts of major
religions throughout the world. Please let me know if you're interested in
reviewing it.

     The following happened to me a while ago when doing one of my 
computer assignments in Turbo Pascal for DOS. Just so you know I'm running a 
"Green"/Energy Star/VESA Power Management (call it what you will) 
486DX2-66 that is set up to power down the hard disk after 15 minutes of 
inactivity. On top of that I run your standard vanilla software disk 
cache software. My story as is follows:
<P>
     I was editing my assignment and since I hadn't read or wrote 
to the hard disk in the last 15 minutes the CMOS instructed the hard disk 
to power itself down (to save power) but I could still edit my program. 
Anyway when I was finished my current editing session I saved my program, 
exited the Turbo Pascal IDE and shut off my computer. 
<P>
     Later that day when I went to edit the same program I noticed the 
program I had saved earlier was not the same one I had loaded up (I had 
lost half an hours work). What I had found out (with a little 
experimentation) is this: the file that I had saved was saved in memory 
in the disk cache. When I exited to DOS, COMMAND.COM was in the cache's 
memory so the hard drive did not have power-up. When I killed the power 
with the hard drive off the cache never had a chance to save the file 
to disk. 
<P>  
The RISK here is obvious:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<OL>
      <LI>Using a PC with DOS, power saving features and a disk cache may 
         result in data loss! This can be particularly RISKy if you like
         to do your assignments the night before they are due. :)
</OL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>      
My recommendations based on my own experiences are:
<BLOCKQUOTE><OL>
      <LI>If your hard drive powers itself down before you hit the power 
         switch then do a "dir" or some other command that will force the 
         hard drive to power-up. This way when the hard drive comes back 
         on the cache will be able to write itself to disk.
      <LI>Switch to Linux. I haven't had this problem since I switched 
         over. :)
</OL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
    Perhaps somebody with a little more understanding of disk caches 
might be better able to explain my experience. As well I've wondered if 
continually shutting down the hard drive decreases its life.
<P>
    In conclusion, this whole incident reminds me of a Kermit the Frog 
quote "It ain't easy being green." :)

Dr. Richard I. Cook's phrase is wonderful!  What proportion of the RISKS
discussed in this list have been due to people depending on the computer
candy shell, or being unable to diagnose a problem when the computer candy
cracks? Probably at least half...  and this problem isn't going to get
better, especially with new operating systems that *never* drop the user
down to a file or program interface and teach people to think that the
pretty graphic user interface *is* the system.

Huh? -- Dates as measured by computers are inherently integers?
<P>
Generally computer systems do assume a certain resolution such as seconds
and can identify the range of dates (or time spans) representable as
integers but whey does that mean they are inherently integers more than any
other measure?  Naive assumptions lead to judgment rather than evaluation.
In fact, Basic typically places the decimal point at the day and then the
time within the day is a fraction of the day.
<P>
Yes, integers are nice because one has (the illusion of) control over them 
but they are not inherently safer than floating point since one can easily 
exceed their representation on either end and very few computers systems (
especially in C) will annoy you with reporting loss of significance or 
overflows.

Reading PGN's book, I remembered another problem on our VAX cluster related
to date/time. The BT PDN X.25 network (then PSS and now called GNS) had an
address which you could call and get the date/time returned accurate to
about 2 seconds. The inaccuracy was due to the call setup/cleardown times
and the network response. We coded an application to get this data and
adjust the VAX system date/time every eight hours at 0210, 1010, 1810, which
takes care of GMT/BST changes as they happen at 0205 in theory.
<P>
VAXen DECNET networks have features that if times are changed packets can
expire suddenly and screwup comms. Also if you run any files with expiry
date/times set, you may run into trouble if the clock suddenly advances.
(wait for it ...)
<P>
BT's online clock (X.121 address 23421920100605) returns a string like this:
<P>
TUE 28/03/95 11:32:59 HRS BST
<P>
If for any reason the link to the atomic clock at Rugby is not working, the
system free runs with a "high" degree of accuracy. Certain fields are
changed so you can detect this (I can't remember which, because I cant find
original document).
<P>
One day on successive calls made one after the other, the results returned
could be 30 seconds apart. This was outside the specification, but there was
no sing of any loss of the radio link to the master clock displayed in the
data. Suddenly all communications on the cluster "hung" and general panic
occurred with all concerned with the cluster as it was in production and it
was about 10am and users reading their mail.  Investigations were
complicated by the fact that someone did undo a connector on the ethernet,
causing all sorts of addition trouble at the same time.
<P>
When the dust settled, we found the whole cluster had a date/time 15 months
in the future, and calling the online clock, it was discovered that this was
indeed the time being returned! Mail date/time stamps were out, deferred
mail got sent, file expired and were removed and batch jobs all started. It
took some time to recover from this.
<P>
The only explanation given by BT was that there was a problem with the
service. We never discovered why we went forward 15 months in May 1988.
<P>
The moral - well 1) never assume what is written down actually is what
happens. 2) if you use such a system, ensure that the clock can't be set
forward or backwards say more than one day in date terms and maybe 12 hours
in time terms. 3) remember the first two points and act on them.  Sorting
out the various collisions of batch jobs, which all started at once over the
cluster took some time. The summertime/wintertime change is benign in
comparison. It is about time computer manufactures fitted good quality clock
chips like in ones watch to keep machine clock in synchronisation and thus
save all this trouble. A system that checked the clock time every hour could
keep the system clock at least in step and if for any reason the change was
more than say 5 seconds, flag the problem with the clock, and just use the
system clock until the clock was fixed.  No system clock should drift more
than 5 seconds in an hour ...

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  This is a truly amazing claim. If it is true, I would think the business
  case for purchasing standard equipment in a hospital would be quite strong,
  even if it was built only on liability reduction.  Never mind the fact that
  2 patients can be treated in the same window on time that one could before,
  or that your ROI for each unit of equipment would be higher due to the
  higher use.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
It is, indeed, a truly amazing claim.  On first blush, it seems to say that
hospital personnel spend an average of 40 minutes, for each patient,
figuring out how to use the equipment.  This is so amazing that I find it
hard to believe.
<P>
A more careful reading, however, reveals that what is being reduced is not
the time to treat each patient, but a number called "post-admittance
treatment lag".  This sounds analogous to the time you spend waiting in line
at the bank.  It is very strongly affected by exactly how much extra
capacity the system has: as the (average) load increases, sneaking up toward
the capacity, the lines get very long.  In this situation, minor variations
in load or capacity can cause large changes in customer wait times.
<P>
In the real world, systems and customers make various adjustments when faced
with long lines: customers come back later, evening out the load; the system
speeds up by adding resources, or reducing time-per-customer.  Also in the
real world, since slack is expensive, servers try to minimize it.  In the
long term, extra slack will cause allocated resources to drift down.
<P>
The resulting wait time is a compromise between cost and customer tolerance.
In the case at hand, the customers are apparently willing to tolerate an
extra 40 minutes in the waiting room.  Suppose the hospital managed to improve
efficiency by a few percent (by switching to standard equipment, or perhaps
by training the personnel better), and the waiting time fell from 70 to 30
minutes.  There would be more slack periods, with idle people and idle
machines; the system response would be to reduce resources until the expected
balance between slack and customer tolerance was restored, probably at an
average 70 minute wait.
<P>
The notion that the time-per-patient can be reduced 50% ("2 patients can be
treated in the same window on time that one could before") seems mistaken --
it might apply to defibrillators (largely idle anyway?), but is unlikely
to apply to the patient's bed, IV equipment, or staff time.  A customer in
the waiting room is using only a chair, undoubtedly the cheapest piece of
equipment the hospital has.

It was probably to be expected, but the Chunnel trains are in trouble
because of sea water. In today's Sunday Times (3rd April 1995), John Harlow
writes that because of unexpectedly (really?!) high levels of sea water,
rogue signals are sent to the drivers and controllers of trains.  The
drivers get 3 red flashing lights and have to do an emergency stop and wait
until controllers have checked the position of all trains in the tunnel,
radio back and reset the signals, which takes up to about 20 minutes.
<P>
A driver for Le Shuttle said there were about 5 emergency stops a week. 
They are running about 100 trains a day, so this is not many, but there 
should be no ghost trains at all. 
<P>
Safety inspectors are worried. On March 17th a train had to stop so 
quickly, glasses fell off tables, and another time a lorry moved forward 
into another vehicle (the trains carry cars and lorries).
<P>
The action of the train at 100mph going through the tunnel raises a mist 
of salt water behind it and this short circuits a low-voltage connection 
between the rails, which mimics a train.
<P>
It appears that engineers have underestimated the effect of sea water, 
an excellent conductor of electricity, on trackside electronic equipment.
<P>
It is also my belief that they also may have underestimated the corrosive
effects of salt water.  This will have the opposite effect and thus cause
other problems.
<P>
We wait, for the next ``advanced technology meets old-fashioned, well-known 
problem and fails again.''

I run an extension on my Mac that compensates for the error in the
computer's realtime clock by occasionally calling up the Naval Observatory
and checking the difference.  It also has the option of automatically
adjusting the clock by an hour for Daylight Savings Time.  Apparently, so
does the new System 7.5.  Anyone want to guess when I'll arrive at work on

Israeli military censorship forbids the local press from publishing the name
of the person who heads the internal security police (known as Shin Bet or
"Shabak").  He can only be referred to as "Kaf" (a letter of the Hebrew
alphabet).  But the Jerusalem Report of 6 April 1995 says that the chief's
name and address were published in a mid-March message on the Internet
(presumably a Usenet post) "circulated freely to millions of net-users all
over the world."  The message, probably circulated by opponents of the man
newly appointed to the post, invited "Internet readers to send 'letters of
congratulation' to the new head man" and gave his correct name and address.
The article went on to note the "anachronism of trying to keep the
secret-service chief's name under wraps in an era when the flow of
information can no longer be controlled."  Opponents of "Kaf" have also
"daubed his name in bold letters on the censor's office in Jerusalem."

[This incident is amusing and bizarre, but I doubt that it is very uncommon.]
<P>
Police cop it from computer (Eugene Bingham, NZ Herald, Thursday 30 March 1995)
<P>
   A police information-gathering exercise turned into a matchmaking fiasco
as a computer system went haywire.  Printouts sent to staff this week as
part of the police department census have recorded as fact a large number of
nonsensical living arrangements.
<P>
   If the census forms are to be believed:
<UL>
      <LI>A policewoman stationed at an Auckland City base is married to
        the wife of another policeman.
      <LI>Another female colleague is married to four officers.
      <LI>Eight officers at a West Auckland station have the same mother.
</UL>
"It is obviously a real big screw-up," a police source said yesterday.
"Everyone thinks it is hilarious."
<P>
   The problems arose when staff began opening the census forms and read a
page of personal information supposedly held on police records.  It is
understood hundreds of errors are contained in the section recording
next-of-kin details.  Embarrassed police officials said yesterday that a
computer glitch had led to the mistakes.
<P>
   Superintendent Jon White, in charge of human resources planning, said the
computer became confused when no information appeared in a staff member's
next-of-kin file.  "It picked up other records and inserted them in their
place."  Mr White said the mistake was "most unfortunate and regrettable."
"Fortunately, most of the staff see the amusing side."
<P>
   Those affected by the glitch have simply been told to cross out the wrong
information and send the corrected form back.  Mr White said the problem
highlighted the fact that many officers had let their personal information
file become out of date.  It was important to keep the next-of-kin
information up to date.  The census, covering sworn and non-sworn staff,
aims to establish a databank of information about the police department.

I received in the mail yesterday an advertisement for a CD ROM called
"Mysteries of the Mind". It includes several (apparently) Eliza-like
programs that provide you with psychological counseling. While it is
referred to as edutainment software, the advertising makes some
extraordinary claims. For example:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  Exiting [sic] new technology gives you...advantage in...relationships
  and even sex!
<P>
  No More:
<P>
  * Hopelessness in your life<BR>
  ...<BR>
  * Horrible sensation of Stress and Depression"
<P>
  Thoughts of liability when somebody kills themself after an
  unproductive session with MotM cross my mind.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
It refers later to the "loving, personal guidance of World's best
psychological software". Now we get into the issues of falling in love with
your computer (or robot) that is a popular topic in science fiction.
<P>
It may be entertaining to use, and perhaps be relaxing, both of which are
good, but the thought of people with real problems relying on this rather
than seeking professional human help ought to cause the authors to lose
sleep at night.
<P>
Still, is it any worse than the multimillion-dollar self-help book business?
Does this potentially represent a fundamentally different problem, or is it
only a matter of degree?
<P>
Perhaps it is even a good thing (self-help books arguably are), but it's
certainly not without a downside.

{The New York Times}, 3 Apr 1995, has an interesting article about two organ
restorations in Paris.
<P>
In late 1992, a much-ballyhooed renovation of the organ at Notre-Dame in
Paris was declared complete, to much publicity.  About a year earlier, to
much less fanfare another Paris organ (at St Sulphice and nearly as large)
had been put into service after it was renovated.
<P>
The St Sulphice restoration was done in a very traditional manner; the
president of the firm doing the job told the {Times} that if there was any
difference in sound (except for fixing actual problems) after his work, then
he'd failed.  He saw his company's job as nothing more or less than making
the organ work precisely as it had the day it was built.  The only
electrical part in the restored organ is the air pump.  And everyone agrees
that the company did a most competent job, exactly as planned.
<P>
Notre Dame is a very different story.  They installed a new high-tech
computer system that allows unheard-of flexibility:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    Literally any combination of pipes can be programmed to operate with
    any key -- total freedom of registration, so a "stop" is just a
    subroutine
<P>
    A performance can be recorded, then played back with microsecond
    accuracy at any later time
</BLOCKQUOTE>
etc., etc. -- lots of bells and whistles (so to speak :-)
<P>
And it has been a disaster!  Only after months of debugging has it reached
the point of being able to get through a Sunday service without glitches.
<P>
Now there's talk of replacing the computer with a more conventional
electronic control system -- one that does nothing more or less than
did the old relays that had been used before the renovation.  The pipes
and valves are all working perfectly, so once they sort out the control
system, they'll be in good shape.
<P>
The basic problem was a classic indeed: going directly to full-scale
implementation of new and untested technology without first building
a prototype!  This should be familiar to all regular RISKS readers.

In risks 17.01, John Gray &lt;<A HREF="mailto:grayjw@cs.aston.ac.uk">grayjw@cs.aston.ac.uk</A>&gt; wrote, quoting from
New Scientist:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  entries in the EPO's international Inpadoc database for patent applicants
  called Robaato Uiraaton Furemingu, Uiriamu Bii Reisufuiirudo, Bii Oo Shii
  Guruupu and Kuringe Fuarama...  Japanese tapes contain names which have
  been translated from Western originals into pictorial characters and back
  again by computer.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
First, to correct a point: Japanese writing consists of three complementary
character sets: the kanji borrowed from Chinese, hiragana, and katakana.
Only the first is pictogram-derived, the other two are phonetic. Foreign
loan words are always written using katakana. Thus, the statement above
misrepresents the source of the problem.
<P>
In addition, the "corrected" name Laceford, from looking at the above, seems
more likely to have been Lacefield (because of the double-i).
<P>
In Japanese (both written and spoken) there are a number of limitations that
make it impossible to render every English word or name correctly (or even
unambiguously): for example, 'th', 'w', and 'v' are essentially impossible
to represent; the sound 'shi' is made to work for the English equivalents of
'si', 'shi' and 'thi'; 'v' and 'b', sometimes 'j' and 'z', and of course the
infamous 'r' and 'l' cannot be distinguished.
<P>
This leads to an entire field of (sometimes amusing) problems well known
among language students. One of my favorites from even before they filed
Chapter 11 is that Thinking Machines rendered in katakana becomes (roughly)
"shinkingu mashiinzu" -- which can then be reread in English as either
"Thinking Machines" or "Sinking Machines".
<P>
Because of the ambiguities introduced, even if heuristics were developed for
translating Japanese katakana words back into English (or other languages),
they could never be 100% perfect. Seeing the katakana for the above
Laceford(field?), it could be reread as Raceford or perhaps even Raysford.
Even in relatively unambiguous cases, English variations in spelling (Jon or
John?) and homonyms (bite or byte?) are troublesome without using context,
where "context" may have to include _a priori_ knowledge of the correct
spelling of individuals' names.
<P>
The problem is not one-way; seeing Japanese or Chinese words rendered in the
Roman alphabet often leaves their corresponding Chinese characters
ambiguous, and without the help of diacritics Chinese pronunciation cannot
be fully represented in the Roman alphabet.
<P>
The problem extends to further levels that are related to the overall
difficulties of searching and indexing free text as well as the difficulties
of translation; I have seen the name of the religious sect likely to be
charged with last week's Tokyo (toukyou, if you transliterate the Japanese
pronunciation) subway attack written in English newspapers as variously Oom
Shinri Kyo (roughly the Japanese pronunciation), Aum Shinri Kyo and Aum
Supreme Truth.
<P>
And of course for Chinese there are several methods of romanizing names; is
a search engine supposed to equate Qing and Ching? And how many automated
indexing systems will correctly work with, for example, the name !Kung?
<P>
It goes up another ugly level when you begin to discuss translating articles
originally written in Japanese about Chinese persons, places or historical
events; the Japanese use the Chinese characters but their own pronunciation,
while we use (roughly) the Chinese pronunciation but know nothing about the
characters.
<P>
None of this is news to language students or developers or users of machine
translation systems, and these fundamental problems are likely unsolvable,
despite the progress of machine translation systems. But with the huge
volumes of material to be translated, how can we do any better than living
with what the best machine translators produce? For that matter, accurate
human translation often requires the active participation of the original
author.
<P>
The risks, besides the above problems of search and index? How about
international banking and medical records never getting correctly
reconciled, or worse, getting improperly reconciled? Are we going to have to
go above the U.S. Social Security Number to an internationally valid
identifier? Talk about Orwellian consequences...

Note from OSHA
<P>
These draft pre-proposal materials are intended to facilitate informed
discussion as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)
develops an Ergonomic Protection Standard. These materials are not being
promulgated as a rule or standard. They do not constitute either a Notice of
Proposed Rulemaking or a source of official OSHA guidance on ergonomics.
Until such time that a final Ergonomic Protection Standard is adopted, OSHA
will continue to rely on Section 5(a)(1) of the Occupational Safety and
Health Act (the "General Duty Clause") for enforcement authority. Failure to
adhere to any draft requirement or guideline in these materials is not a
violation of the General Duty Clause; use of these materials to assist in
ergonomic protection may indicate that workplace hazards are receiving
adequate attention.

Software Safety Engineering
<P>
New software safety handbook:<BR>
sponsored by the US military services, pending NASA, FAA and Coast Guard
joining.  Book is structured to be compatible with process oriented
software development (ISO 12207, DOD-STD-498, IEEE 1498/EIA IS-640) in
similarly oriented system engineering life cycle (EIA 632, IEEE 120) and
usable for inspections and reviews (IEEE 1028, ISO 9000-3 and/or TickIT).
Any acquisition, development and fielding life cycle, including re-use,
can be configured/tailored from the "building block" approach. A list of
"best practices" is envisioned as an appendix. Possible CD ROM version
under investigation.  A display will be given at the System Safety Society
meeting in July in San Jose, CA, and at the American Society of Safety
Engineers Technology 2000 in Orlando, FL, in June. A similar tutorial is
hoped for at COMPASS in Gaitherberg, MD, in late June 95.  An industry
review period is expected beginning in Sept 1995.
<P>
IEC 1508 "Functional Safety: Safety related systems".
Work began and otherwise known as IEC/SC65A working groups 9 &amp; 10 now
re-named IEC 1508. Standard will be released for review in mid 1995 in
seven parts.  Part 1 is general requirements, part 2 requirements for
electrical/electronic/ programmable electronic systems, part 3 software
requirements, part 4 definitions, part 5 guidelines on application of part
1, part 6 guidelines on application of parts 2 and 3, part 7 bibliography
of techniques.  This standard will apply to industrial and consumer goods.
Extension standards for specific industries is encouraged, hence a medical
device and software (databases?) standard has already been formed. 
Robotics, fire detection and suppression, elevators, off shore rigs,
automobile and aircraft parts are expected to be effected.
<P>
UL 1998 (Underwriter's Laboratory) Standard for Safety-related Software
"Standard is to be used in conjunction with current methods used to
investigate hardware.  The standard covers both software that directly
controls safety-related functions and software that has the potential to
pose a risk of injury to persons or loss of property. (quoted from UL
cover letter)".  This standard is appended to end product standards, which
include: solid state controls for appliances, primary safety controls for
gas and oil fired appliances, molded case circuit breakers and enclosures,
industrial control equipment, temperature indicating and regulating
equipment, burglar alarm communicator systems, and information technology
equipment.
<P>
System Safety Society and commercial STD-882
The System Safety Society is working with a standards group to make
available a commercial version of MIL-STD-882. This standard is in work
and a rough draft has been produced for the committee use.  There is
currently no commercial equivalent that covers all aspects of a system
safety program. This will be usable for safety V&amp;V and audits.  Software

Andersen Charged
<P>
Andersen Consulting is charged with fraud, incompetence and neglect in a
$US100 million lawsuit filed by UOP, a US-based engineering company.  In its
lawsuit, which also seeks unspecified punitive damages, UOP said Andersen
Consulting bungled the development of computer systems it needed to help
manage its business. The company's complaint alleges that after winning the
contract, Andersen Consulting's "ineptitude and deception" caused late
deliveries, "bilked millions" of dollars from UOP and wound up supplying a
computer system that was largely unusable.  Bloomberg  <BR>

: but actually hides a wealth of complexity...
<P>
The same comment applies to most of the "computer-" and "software-" related
risks discussed in this forum.  Computer and software risks are not
fundamentally different from other types of risks.  In all cases, the root
cause of unexpected behavior lies in the complexity of the total system, not
in the nature of its components.  And when we build systems to perform
complex functions, the systems we build are necessarily complex.
<P>
There are, of course, reasons to build complex systems.  Consider the often
attacked practice of using software in safety-critical systems, like
airplanes.  Aircraft companies compete with one another to build the most
efficient planes, and as in so many cases, squeezing the last bit of
efficiency out of a plane introduces a great deal of complexity into the
design.  In order to realize the gains, manufacturers have to find ways to
allow the planes to be flown with a minimum amount of crew, so they turn to
computers to help them manage the complexity, a step that increases (rather
than decreases) the complexity of the plane.
<P>
The fact that something is complex and sometimes behaves unexpectedly does
not mean that it's overall performance is not more beneficial than a less
complex alternative.  A more complex, more efficient plane, for example, may
reduce the cost of air travel, allowing more people to choose air travel
over other, riskier modes of transportation (it could be argued, for
example, that air travel is currently too safe, because the close attention
to safety raises the cost of short-haul flights and encourages people to
drive instead).  An infuser interface that hides complexity from the user
may allow infusers to be used beneficially in more circumstances than they
otherwise would, and those benefits may outweigh the costs of the cases
where the infuser causes harm.
<P>
With sufficiently complex systems and sufficiently large stakes, however, it
is very difficult to make reasonable judgements about the tradeoffs, and
even if we make good judgements, we are unlikely to be comfortable depending
on systems whose behavior we will never fully understand.

In <A HREF="/Risks/17.02.html">RISKS-17.02</A>, Debora Weber-Wulff indicates surprise at the use of a stack
and "dynamic data structures in a safety-critical system", the Deutsche
Bahn's new train control system. While my experience with real-time
development is limited, and I have no experience whatsoever in
safety-critical systems, I would not fault them for using a stack-based
architecture. Dynamic data structures, whether stack or heap, are a
reasonable means for managing limited memory resources, provided there is a
means for storing critical data in permanent, recoverable structures in an
atomic fashion.
<P>
Where I would fault them is for not being aware of the behavior and capacity
requirements of their system under load and overload conditions. Were they
unaware of the depth of their deepest routine call tree? Or, since this was
apparently related to the number of trains being managed, was it a recursive
algorithm run amok? A little more modeling and testing by a few paranoid
personalities would be in order (my belief is that every project should have
a "token pessimist" to combat the general Barney-like optimism that pervades
most development work). Further, I would expect a railroad to have done
significant capacity planning (how many trains on the tracks at different
hours, etc.), which would be used as input into the design and test phases.
It's not like they haven't seen rush hour and holiday loads before.
<P>
Running out of memory is a common risk in dynamic memory management. The
naive programmer will simply assume that all allocations are successful (or
that the system will deal with allocation failures in a benign and
acceptable manner), and is generally unaware of this latent bug because he
fails to test the system under sufficient load. The defensive programmer
will assume that all allocations will fail, and structure the software to
handle such a case. This is a critical decision that can totally alter the
design of a program; it is not easy to retrofit defensive code into software
that was not built with a defensive frame of mind.

analogous to the current use of firewalls, but I don't recall this
particular RISK being brought up in that book.

So far as my own poor memory recalls, the "Flash Crowd" idea is Niven's. It
was first brought up in the short stories "Flash Crowd", "All the Bridges

Niven's other transfer booths stories like "A Kind of Murder" are equally

Peter Wayner suggests that providers of Web pages (and presumably other on-
line resources) follow in the footsteps of the movie industry and rate their
own materials, so that viewers could be written to limit access by children.
<P>
It's a nice idea, but Mr. Wayner fails to understand how the movie rating
system works.  First of all, ratings are not, as in Wayner's suggestion,
provide by the producers of movies.  Rather, there is a central organization,
composed mainly of non-industry people, who set the standards, preview each
movie, and provide a rating.  The rating is subject to negotiation, and
producers can make suggested modifications to get a different rating if they
like.  The rating system has been the subject of significant debate between
producers and the rating board.  In particular, the "X" rating, originally
meant to describe movies with "adult" themes - "Urban Cowboy" and "Blow Up"
are probably significant early examples of mainstream X-rated movies - soon
came to apply only to pornographic material, and in fact fell into complete
disuse, except for self-ratings by those who made frankly pornographic
material.  The ratings board added a trademarked "NC-17" rating a few years
back to have some way to rate non-pornographic but adult material, but it
hasn't seen much use.
<P>
The second error is that the movie rating system is in meaningful sense
"voluntary".  The vast majority of movie theatres in the US, other than
those specializing in pornographic material, will not show non-rated
material.  The reason the X rating fell into disuse was that they wouldn't
show X-rated material either.  NC-17 is in trouble because it is avoided by
some of the larger chains, too.  More recently, the largest video stores
refuse to rent non-rated or X-rated (or perhaps NC-17-rated) material.
<P>
So ... the rating system is "voluntary", so long as you don't mind being shut
out of the market.
<P>
As a result, I see little similarity between what Mr. Wayner proposes and the
movie rating system as it actually exists, and little reason to use the
success of one, such as it is, as evidence for the workability of the other.
<P>
More generally, I see little reason to believe that "netiquette" will be
sufficient to restrain anyone interested in providing material to the net -
as it has had little effect on flaming, inappropriate commercial postings,
or many other net problems.

Well, here it is, only 10 hours until the Internet As We Know It will grind
to a halt.  Of course, the Imminent Demise of the 'Net has been predicted
before.  In fact, this will be at least the fifth time that I have
personally witnessed such mass hysteria and overzealous concern over the
"safety and integrity" of the Internet.
<P>
There has been so much hype over the release of SATAN, including articles in
the New York Times, fer cryin' out loud, that entirely too many people have
no idea what is going on, but They Are Sure That Truly The Sky Will Fall.
<P>
It is very strange, and somehow wonderful, that our society finally has
enough people with some knowledge of the Internet, that they could even care
about the integrity of the Internet.  It is also, however, sad that they do
not understand that thing which they use every day, and have come to depend
on so much.
<P>
What is the truth behind the hype?  Will SATAN be the ultimate "cracking"
tool?  Is it the network equivalent of an unstoppable skeleton key?
<P>
Of course not.  SATAN is nothing more than a software implementation of a
checklist of well-known flaws in the design and/or implementation of the
UNIX operating system and its network servers, and Internet protocols.
There is nothing in SATAN that hasn't been seen in at least a dozen
intrusion attempts in the last year.  The holes examined by SATAN have been
known to the cracker community for years in most cases.
<P>
Does this mean that the release of SATAN is unimportant?  That all the hype
and publicity has been a mistake?  That there is no reason to worry?
<P>
Again, of course not.  After the Michelangelo virus media "event" of a few
years ago, the computer world breathed a huge sigh of relief.  The
predictions were that between 15 and 50% of the world's personal computers
would be destroyed by Michelangelo.  This obviously didn't happen.  True,
most estimates of infection rates were obviously out of line.  But a
significant number of companies and individual users reported that due to
the media blitz, they now took virus protection seriously, and almost
everyone admitted that they scanned their systems for virii in the weeks
before Michelangelo was due.
<P>
SATAN will be important for the same reason that Michelangelo and Crack have
been important: they have raised the issue of computer security in a way
that cannot be ignored, and they have given harried system and network
administrators some of the same tools already in use by cracker.
<P>
Sites that used to be able to ignore the risks of connecting to the
Internet, who believed that they were immune, too low-profile, of just
didn't understand now know that they *must* take steps to protect
themselves.
<P>
With the certain knowledge that SATAN (and other tools) are out there, being
susceptible to well-known attacks clearly shows a lack of "due diligence",
which a term which courts and juries seem to understand.
<P>
Now that SATAN is out, any commercial site that is cracked may find itself
involved in legal action from its users and customers.
<P>
There is considerable belief (one might also suggest consensus) that the
availability of Crack has forced sites to use non-dictionary passwords.
Since Crack became available, the "cracking" of passwords from stolen
password file has almost completely disappeared from the Internet.
<P>
SATAN will level the playing field, as now system administrators who things
to do other than write custom cracking packages will have the same tools as
the "black hats".
<P>
I hope that the release of SATAN will encourage vendors to increase the
security of their shipped products, and raise the level of security
awareness throughout the Internet.  Just by existing, it will, after a time,
improve the integrity of the 'Net as we now know it.
<P>
But for the next few weeks, "let's be careful out there."

     The authors of the recently released SATAN package for probing Internet
sites have shown a level of amorality that should gladden the hearts of the
National Rifle Association and arms merchants around the world.
<P>
     By close analogy, SATAN's parents' attitude appears to be that it's
perfectly OK, perhaps even admirable, to go from house to house without
permission trying each door and window to see if it's unlocked, or perhaps
not locked securely enough.  If caught inside, the intruder would of course
claim he or she was just performing a "security check", and gee whiz, that
homeowner REALLY should buy a better lock!  Bull****.
<P>
     That sort of argument wouldn't wash with unauthorized residential
probing/entries/burglaries, and it shouldn't be acceptable for such
unauthorized activities when directed against computer systems either.
<P>
     Up to now, most system administrators have tended to take a fairly
permissive attitude towards hacking probes/attacks--at least the first time.
Usually the farthest they go is to warn the offending users and/or system
administrators at the site originating the attack, and let it go at that.
The time has come for this attitude to change.
<P>
     It's time for it to be made clear in no uncertain terms that any
unauthorized probing cases will be immediately turned over to law
enforcement for appropriate criminal and/or civil actions whenever possible.
A variety of laws would appear to make it illegal to use SATAN or similar
tools against a site without that site's permission.  Most likely there are
a number of cyber-lawyers who could do quite well specializing in this area.
<P>
     Where attacking users can be identified, enforcement can be directed
towards them.  Where sites are unable or unwilling to cooperate in
identifying the user, then action may have to be taken against sites where
attacks originated as well.
<P>
     It is perhaps unfortunate that this sort of "no more excuses" policy
will probably net a large number of rather ignorant users who run tools like
SATAN "for fun" while oblivious to the logging, tracking, tracing, and other
countermeasures that exist against it.  But that's the price they'll have to
pay for playing with powerful tools left laying around by amoral software
engineers.

       be hacked to run unprivileged.  But breaking root in the

I suppose I shouldn't be surprised, but the power went out for 17,000 here
in our small town (38,000) last week.  The local newspaper first reported
that the power company didn't know why it went out, but that it "may be
related to someone digging in their back yard".  A week later they fixed the
blame.  A phone call (by the power company), supposedly to one substation,
(completely automated judging by the tone of the article) went instead to a
different substation (for unexplained reasons) and shut that substation
down. It was down for 1.5 hours.
<P>
The risks??  Just think of a few well placed calls by non-power company
people to major metropolitan areas in the dead of night if they have similar
systems.

I have heard recently that the new Boeing 777 jetliner, described
in recent news reports as "skating through the approval process",
has a little problem that might be interesting to RISKS readers.
<P>
It seems that an important part of the landing gear is too weak, and will
get "used up" (through metal fatigue), and need to be replaced annually.
While this is probably not a safety problem, it's an extra expense (frequent
inspections and replacements) and an embarrassment.
<P>
Unfortunately, fixing it isn't just a matter of making the part stronger; it
would then be bigger and heavier, affecting fit, balance, and nearby parts.
This sort of problem is familiar in the "shakeout period" of all previous
jetliners, but it's surprising that it showed up so late in the approval
process.  (A previous 7?7 has a nonlinearity in the landing gear linkage
that caused an oscillation when trying to close the doors; it was fixed by
an appalling hydraulic "patch" that cancels feedback during the nonlinear
portion of the cycle.)
<P>
How did this mistake get all the way through Boeing's legendary engineering
process?  The 777 is the first commercial Boeing to have been modeled
entirely on computer before construction.  Apparently the part is precisely
a factor of two weaker than it should have been.  Does this smell like a
structural model entry error?  I have been unable to find out more about the
source of the error, and would welcome more detailed information.
<P>
Maybe the RISK is in streamlining your engineering process so well, and
eliminating so many of the more common mistakes that would have caused

The Management and Administrative Computing Initiative (MACI) is an attempt 
to get all universities in the UK to use the same computer package for their 
administrative operations. (In fact, it has been found necessary to define 
four "families" of universities with similar approaches, and design a 
package for each family.) 
<P>
The requirements specification, design and gradual implementation of the 
MAC packages is proceeding. The following anecdote might amuse readers of 
RISKS who take an interest in Human Computer Interface design. 
<P>
The part of the MAC package which deals with job applications in a certain 
university (which shall remain nameless) has had an interesting little 
"feature" incorporated into its HCI by one of the implementors (who has since 
moved on to pastures new). To save the effort of the typists in keying 
data into a name or address field, he arranged that letters could be typed 
in upper or lower case anywhere, and on input the case would be changed so 
that initials and the first letter of each word would be capitalised, and 
the remainder put into lower case. 
<P>
To a two-fingered typist like him, this probably seemed like a great 
labour-saving idea. For a trained touch typist (such as my informant) it 
saves nothing, of course. Not only that, but responses to applications are 
now being sent to "Dr. B. O'malley, University Of Newcastle-Upon-Tyne". 
<P>
Lessons for HCI design would seem to be:- 
<OL>
<LI> Write a specification. 
<P>
<LI>Get someone else to read it before implementation. 
<P>
<LI>Better still, get the feedback from the use of a prototype. 
<P>
<LI>If you want to know the user's requirements, ask the user! 
</OL>
The costs of getting a different person to remove the feature, and of 
cleaning up the database, are still being counted!

So what's the risk?  We have been conditioned to think of telephones
as non-programmable devices.  So when we purchase a new phone system
which is programmable, we may neglect applying the same quality 
assurance to phone programming as we [hopefully] do to normal 
software.
<P>
A good way to avoid the trap is to inventory your belongings.  Which 
things do you own that are actually dumb, purportedly dumb, or 
traditionally intelligent?  Presumably you know how to deal
with the first and last.  Now think carefully about the middle ones.
Are you treating them with proper lack of trust?

From "Today" newspaper, London, England, 6 April 1995:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    Nick Ingram's execution will be controlled by a computer.
    It is the first of its kind and follows a series of electric chair
    bungles where condemned men survived a manually controlled surge.
    Three executioners will each push a button to activate the computer
    but only one is "live", leaving none of the trio knowing if he started
    the deadly process.
<P>
    The computer will then take 30 seconds checking every connection to
    Ingram's head, legs and arms and, if there are no problems, will send
    2,000 volts slamming into his body for four seconds.
<P>
    It then switches the current to 1,000 volts for seven seconds and 208
    volts for two minutes.
<P>
    Throughout the execution, the computer's systems monitor the current,
    making sure there is no drop in power.
<P>
    Five minutes from when the current is stopped, a doctor will pronounce
    the Briton dead.

An recent AP article describes a prototype vending machine installed
at the Raleigh-Durham International Airport.  The machine sells
shareware.  A customer inserts a floppy disk, selects a program,
inserts money, and out pops the disk with the software installed.
<P>
I suppose that the RISKS are really no different than when retrieving
software over the network, and practically is not as big a problem since far
fewer people will use it.  Somehow, though, the thought of a row of machines
at which I can buy Camels, Coke, Snickers, and Tetris makes me shiver.

Computer break-ins are still on the rise, often accompanied by significant
financial losses.  The Computer Emergency Response Team's manager says the
number of reported violations was 130 in 1990, 800 in 1992, 1,300 in 1993
and 2,300 in 1994.  A 1994 survey by Ernst and Young of more than a thousand
companies showed 20% reporting financial losses as a result of computer
break-ins.  An earlier study by USA Research cited losses of $164 million in
1991 due to unauthorized intrusions.  (Technology Review, April 1995, p.33)

Citing Paul Russell (Chief Engineer, Boeing Airplane Safety Engineering) an
August 18, 1994 article in The Aviation Daily reported that the "jet
transport accident rate plummeted between 1959 and 1975 but has been fairly
flat since then...".
<P>
"With more and more traffic looming in the future ..." there is "a
projection of one jet transport hull loss per week by the year 2010".
<P>
A hull loss is airplane damage which is substantial and beyond economic
repair.

The only objection I can think of to the proposed system of sorting possibly
objectionable material according to "over13" and etc is this: one of the
current justifications for NOT regulating the adult material is that it
takes some looking to find it.  The proposed rating system would seem to
make such materials readily identifiable via searching, thus pointing out
for all the world the locations of this material, and making it easier for
kids using unrestricted browsers to find.

This happened to my wife a couple of weeks ago &amp; she said some passengers
became somewhat frantic looking for rising waters - officials did come
around giving out coupons for a half price repeat trip if taken within two
months - Universal Studios did something similar when it opened and the Jaws

My local branch of the Midland Bank has just upgraded its ATM (automatic
teller machine - hole in the wall cash dispenser).  The old unit had a
central keypad, and a green screen with a filter which restricted the useful
angle of vision to about ten degrees either side of dead-in-front.  The
screen was positioned to the left of the machine, making it easy to block
almost the whole arc and it was not readable from more than about 5m away.
You could prevent all but the most persistent shoulder-hanger from seeing
your PIN being entered, and your balance when it came up on the screen, by
interposing your body.
<P>
The new box features a nice bright colour screen and flashing lights to
point you to the next bit of the ATM to look at (card slot, cash slot and so
forth).  Unfortunately, the nice bright screen is visible clearly from about
10m or more away, over an approximate 90 degrees of arc at least.  To make
things worse, the keypad is placed to the left of the machine, so that 90%
of the population is left to dial in their PIN slowly and laboriously with
their wrong hand.  Oh, and the keys are so stiff that anyone standing to the
right of the machine could not hope to avoid being able to read off the PIN
as it is stabbed in.  The final insult is that - like former machines from
the same bank - the balance is shown on-screen only.  No option to print it
out instead.
<P>
What a disaster!  The RISKS abound - PINs are highly visible from an
adjacent position, all on-screen transactions are highly visible over a wide
area and there is no option to check your balance in privacy.  The only
consolation is that, in sleepy Diss, a mugging would be the talk of the town
for months.
<P>
I had a word with the branch manager.  Apparently, these machines are
replacing existing units everywhere in the UK in a rolling upgrade
programme.  He conceded the security problems - reluctantly, after a
predicatable comment that, "They must have looked into the security aspects
beforehand."
<P>
I suggested that both (1) an arc-restricting filter be added, and; (2) the
firmware be altered to allow an option for balances to be printed only,
rather than displayed.  I get the impression that the "Listening Bank" will
quietly file the suggestions in the round file.

  ISBN: 01201-11972-2, $49.50.
<P>
This book examines past accidents and what is currently known about building
safe electromechanical systems to see what lessons can be applied to new
computer-controlled systems.  One lesson is that most accidents are not the
result of unknown scientific principles but rather of a failure to apply
well-known, standard engineering practices.  A second lesson is that
accidents will not be prevented by technological fixes alone, but will
require control of all aspects of the development and operation of the
system.  The features of a methodology for building safety-critical systems
are outlined.

The Toronto Globe and Mail reports that a commercial jet carrying 72 pigs
and 300 human passengers had to make an emergency landing after having its
fire alarms triggered by excessive levels of methane, ammonia and body heat
in the cargo hold where the pigs were traveling (you surely did not expect
that the pigs were traveling economy class).  Apparently, excessive
flatulence, urine, droppings and the heat generated by the bodies of the
pigs caused the automated fire-extinguishing system to flood the cargo hold
with halon, killing 15 of the very valuable hogs. The risks of flying pigs
are evident.

For my personal E-mail, etc., I use the services of an Internet provider.  I
noticed today that the systems were still on Standard Time.  I sent a
message to the operators and received the following in return.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  Due to an obscure bug in the system libraries, for this particular switch to
  daylight savings time only, the system calculated when it should change to
  DST incorrectly.  (It thinks it does not start until this coming Sunday.)
  Because the bug will not occur in other years, and because we would have to
  rebuild all the system programs which depend on this system library, which
  would take longer than a week, we decided to just wait out the week until the
  clock returned to sanity.
<P>
  If this is causing you any specific problems, please let us know.

I'm sure this sort of thing is well documented in RISKS ... so much so I
continue to be surprised that I'm surprised that it continues to happen.

Atlas Computer Systems has fired the advertising consultant who suggested
that posting an advertisement to all the Usenet newsgroups was an effective
way of advertising a 1-gigabyte hard disc drive. Atlas suffered several days
of mail-bombing as well as repeated calls to its 1-800 number from irritated
Usenet readers. The New Scientist quotes Atlas's vice-president Matt Nye as
saying that the consultant suggested spamming the newsgroups after reading
Canter and Siegel's infamous publication "How to make a fortune on the

: The defensive programmer will assume that all allocations will fail, <BR>
: and structure the software to handle such a case. 
<P>
Furthermore, the software's ability to recover from the failure of any
particular allocation attempt must be tested if we're to have any confidence
in its working.  It is not enough merely to bear in mind the possibility of
allocation failure while writing the client code.
<P>
Is it feasible to test all possible allocation failure modes?  Forcing the
allocation routine to always fail would be pointless, since attempts to
allocate storage are likely to be contingent on the success of earlier
attempts.  Alternatively, one could maintain a counter N of program runs,
and coerce the allocator to fail on its N'th call.  This is a computational
effort proportional to the program run time multiplied by the number of
memory allocations in each run.  This exhaustive method would exercise all
possible failure modes for a given input, but is likely to be intolerably
time-consuming for real programs.
<P>
So we retreat to heuristic approaches.  One such involves examining the
sequence of stored program counters on the stack when the allocation routine
is called.  A checksum of the program counters can then be computed and
compared against a list of those already seen.  If no match is found, insert
the checksum into the list and return failure; if a match is found, allocate
the storage and return success.  Thus, upon the first appearance of a
particular sequence of program counters on the stack, the allocator will
return failure.  This has the desirable effect of exercising allocation
error recovery code that might appear anywhere in the call chain.  However,
if that error recovery code contains a bug that only manifests itself when
the program variables assume some particular state, the bug may not be
found.  Consider the following slightly contrived example in C:
<CODE><PRE>
    void *p1;
    void *p2;

    Bool allocate_p1_and_p2() 
    {
        int np1bytes;
        
        for ( np1bytes = 1024; (p1 = malloc( np1bytes)) == NULL; np1bytes &gt;&gt;= 1)
            ;
        p2 = malloc( 1);
        
        if ( p1 == NULL &amp;&amp; p2 == NULL)      /* never satisfied */
            return TRUE;                    /* XXX: should be FALSE */
        else if ( p1 == NULL &amp;&amp; p2 != NULL)
            free( p2);
            return FALSE;
        else if ( p1 != NULL &amp;&amp; p2 == NULL)
            free( p1);
            return FALSE;
        else
            return TRUE;
   }
</PRE></CODE>
With the stack-examining allocator described above, the line marked
with "XXX" will never be executed, and its bug won't be found.
<P>
One can imagine an allocator that fails pseudo-randomly according to
some probability distribution, but again, the more failures, the
longer the run time, with no guarantee of finding all possible bugs in
the recovery code.

&gt; In the real world, systems and customers make various adjustments when faced<BR>
&gt; with long lines [...]
<P>
In the real world, people also make various adjustments when faced with
short lines, the most prominent of which is to use the service more,
causing the lines to get longer very fast. (NB: Note that people with
immediate heart problems are unlikely to come back later. :-( )
<P>
This is shown in analyses of real-world commuter traffic patterns. People
use the shortest way to work available. So if there's a congestion and you
build a new bypass, within a few weeks more people will use the new road,
until it's just as congested as before. Unless you eliminate all points
where congestions can form, which is of course impossible in the real
world.
<P>
The better way to reduce congestion is to offer an alternate service. 
For commuters, you use railroads (or tell them to stay at home and commute
electronically ;-)  -- for people with heart problems, the sensible solition
would probably be a fast-track way to get people with life threatening
problems ahead of those who wait for getting their warts burned off.
Don't ask me, though -- the real RISK is to jump to untenable conclusions
("halve the response time by standardizing on one defibrillator") based on
incomplete data.

This reminds me of an incident that happened about 2 years ago.
<P>
In Toronto, we used to have these wonderful wall-mounted ATM's in shopping
malls.  They had high, wall-mounted, membrane keyboards, and were located
where lots of people could "hang out".
<P>
A generally shorter, thinner than average, female co-worker told us
that she had used such a machine, had entered a fairly complex
transaction, removing money from a secondary account.  A hour or
so later, while shopping for clothes, her purse was stolen.  Within
minutes, large amounts of money were removed from her accounts.
<P>
It was fairly obvious, that someone had watched and memorized her
entire key-sequence.  They then followed her, or sent someone to
steal her purse at an unguarded moment.
<P>
Luckily for her, it was shown that her PIN number was not obvious, 
and was not written down anywhere.  The bank fought furiously, but
she had family and friends with a lot of influence (threatened to
take out all their money), and she got her money back.
<P>
Although the bank denied everything, it was interesting to note, that
within months, all such machines were being ripped out from shopping
areas and being replaced with "shrouded" keyboards.  Also, "hidden"
cameras are now appearing everywhere.

In <A HREF="/Risks/17.01.html">RISKS-17.01</A>, John Gray summarizes a report from New Scientist about
problem in searching databases of patents, including in particular problems
arising because of typos and spelling errors in the database.
<P>
Plus ca change, plus ce la meme chose.  In roughly 1980, I did some work on a
spelling checker program.  As part of this, I dug through the literature.  I
found an article - source and details long forgotten - that reported on an
empirical study of some kind of textual database.  The study found that a
significant portion of the entries in the database contained spelling or other
recording errors, many of them in the indexed portions of the data.  The
conclusion was that queries based on exact matches stood a significant chance
of failing to find entries they should have found.  I don't recall the domain
of the database involved, but as I recall missing even one entry that should
have matched was considered to be a problem.  As a result, they recommended
that all queries use some kind of "loose match" algorithm.  (I don't recall
if they suggested one.)
<P>
At least fifteen years later, we appear not to have learned this lesson.
<P>
This is, by the way, an example of a significant limitation of many
computer- based indexing systems: They make it difficult to use the *human*
ability to do smart approximate matching.  A couple of years ago, I heard a
fragment of an interview with an author of a book that sounded interesting.
I was only able to get the author's last name, and an understanding of the
meaning of the title - not the actual title.  When I later tried to use the
on-line catalogue at the local library, I found it very difficult to locate
the book.  The catalogue was tree-structured: I had to first choose a
particular author - and there were a good number of them with the same last
name - then view titles by that author, a few at a time.  I gave up after a
little while and located a paper copy of "Books in Print", where a few
seconds of scanning "by eye" located the book.  Computer interfaces work
well when you use them to do what the designers had in mind, but when it
comes to true flexibility, more traditional designs can often win big,
exactly because they are better at "getting out of the way" and letting the
pattern matcher in our heads do the work.

Here in Saint Louis we're running low on telephone numbers.  With the 
rapid rise in cellular service, many new phone numbers have been 
assigned in this area code (314), leading to something of a shortage.
<P>
This causes (at least) two problems:
<OL>
   <LI>more wrong numbers when people transpose digits
   <LI>rapid reassignment of numbers when service is disconnected
</OL>
#1: wrong numbers are more likely to successfully connect -- to the 
wrong person
<P>
The first problem became REAL noticeable to me when some company in 
Australia tried to FAX documents to a decorating company in my 
exchange several times a night over several nights -- AT ABOUT 2:00 
AM, Saint Louis time.  They had the last 2 digits of the phone number 
transposed.  At no time did they try the number by hand or turn on / 
listen to their FAX speaker.  (You'd think that after several 
unsuccessful FAX attempts in a row to a new number, they'd try it 
with a voice phone!)
<P>
This is really a risk of having voice and data communications over 
the same network.
<P>
The fix:  I hooked up a FAX machine to my home phone and received the 
FAX one night.  By reading the FAX I could tell who sent it and who 
they were trying to send it to.  (The correct FAX number, without 
digits transposed, was printed on the FAX they sent!)  I forwarded 
the FAX to the intended recipient, and called them, asking them to 
talk to their Australian customer.  But their telephone operator was 
playing stupid that day, and kept asking what business relationship I 
had that their Australian customer would want to FAX documents 
through me.  Telling her about the transposed digits in the phone 
number didn't help.  Eventually I gave up and called the Australian 
company directly.  They understood the problem immediately.  (...and 
we wonder why we loose business to foreigners -- who have brains and 
use them.   ;-)
<P>
#2: disconnected numbers are more likely to connect -- with the wrong 
person
<P>
After moving in, I was given a number that had obviously just been 
released by someone moving out of my exchange.  For the first few 
months, I'd get several calls a week asking for the other person.  I 
called directory assistance and found his new number.  (He was still 
living in Saint Louis.)  When I get calls for him, I give them his 
new number.  There's nothing the telephone company can do to fix 
this, given the shortage of phone numbers.
<P>
It's amazing:  After 2 years, I still get 2 or 3 calls a month from 
sales people asking for that other person.  He must be on all the 
best "telephone sucker lists."  The sale people almost always give up 
as soon as they find I'm not who they're looking for.

(Re: A possible "solution" to Internet SATAN: Handcuffs -- RISKS DIGEST 17.04)<BR>
&gt;      By close analogy, SATAN's parents' attitude appears to be that it's<BR>
&gt; perfectly OK, perhaps even admirable, to go from house to house ...
<P>
and extends the analogy to argue that those probing systems
gratuitously should be punished even if they cause no harm.
<P>
I think that this quote illustrates well the RISKS associated with what
Usenet readers once referred to as "analogy wars" (did Tom Duff coin this
phrase?).  The risk comes in two parts:
<OL>
	<LI>It is easy to confuse an analogy with an
	isomorphism, and behave accordingly.
	<LI>It is easy to take advantage of (1) to win an
	argument by choosing an analogy which, if treated as
	an isomorphism, leads to a desired conclusion.
</OL>
In this particular case, consider the following scenarios:
<OL>	<LI>I decide to implicate X in a crime, so I hack a copy
	of SATAN so that it looks like my security probes are
	coming from X.
	<LI>I probe randomhost.subdomain.cs, and the DNS resolver
	decides that this must have been in Czechoslovakia.
</OL>
What are some analogous situations in "burglary world"?
<OL>
	<LI>I disguise myself as X, and then deliberately let
	myself be caught burgling a house.
	<LI>I decide to try to break into my own house to
	test its security, but accidentally try to break into
	another house which looks like mine.
</OL>
Neither of these "burglary world" situations seems too likely.  This can be
seen to be a result of subtle problems in the analogy: In a[b], it would be
difficult to disguise oneself effectively enough to achieve the desired
result.  In b[b], I am unlikely to be confused about which house is mine. (I
also am unlikely to try to test a home's security by attempting a breakin.)
<P>
The "burglary world"
  [system == home, network == world, port == front door,
   security == lock, intruder == burglar,
   legal system == legal system]
analogy is very popular on the net, but it really doesn't seem to me to work
very well.  I find the final identity, in particular, very disturbing.  I
personally think that SATAN's authors (*not* parents :-) had the attitude
that "it's perfectly OK to send network packets to a computer system in
order to see how it responds" -- which seems to me like a much less
controversial statement.

The SATAN tool's proper use is very different: it's for checking YOUR OWN
systems.  I doubt that the unnamed correspondent, or anyone else, would
object to its use in that capacity.
<P>
The argument that SATAN should not have been released because it can probe
systems not under the prober's control strikes me as odd.  The analogy of
housebreaking given above overlooks that attempted burglary is illegal in most
jurisdictions that I know of.  That's what the intruder would be charged
with in the analogy above.  Does this mean we should ban all tools that
could be used to aid someone in checking the safety of a house, since
those tools can be used to find the weak points in another's house?
<P>
Perhaps a simpler conclusion to draw from the analogy is that there is no tool
or device that is completely beneficial.  Everything can be abused, and SATAN
is no exception.  The response should not be to focus on the release of the
tool, but to focus on educating people in the customary codes of behavior
and chastizing those who abuse the tools -- anyway, that's my opinion.  The
anonymous poster makes this same point later on, but its importance is vitiated
by the characterization of the morality of the authors of SATAN (a
characterization with which I disagree, by the way).

From the Orange County Register, Orange County CA, 3/29/1995 edition,
crediting "Register news services":
<P>
The article describes in 3 paragraphs the effect on train traffic of a
computer crash:  "[it] froze passenger and freight trains in their tracks"
for 2 hours.  8 states in the Southeast US were affected during Monday (3/
27) evening rush hour on tracks operated by CSX Transportation.  Service
was restored "under human direction".
<P>
Services that were held up included Amtrak (2100 passengers), Tri-Rail
commuters in south Florida (5000 passengers) and freight trains in
locations from Louisiana to North Carolina.
<P>
[Notes from dps: Most major railroads have reduced the number of dispatching
centers, in the trend typical of many modern businesses.  For instance, UPRR
now operates all dispatching from Omaha, Nebraska, and SPRR from Denver,
Colorado.  CSX can be assumed to have done the same type of consolidation.
Key elements of this move include computer displays to show the status of
tracks and traffic flow (replacing specialized "CTC" boards),
communiciations equipment (often already in plade, just a new hop).  These
computers often also show the availability of equipment.
<P>
Resuming "under human direction" was probably done by the same dispatcher
staff, but using "track warrants" instead of signalling, and with locations
of trains tracked by radio rather than by the signalling equipment.  This
would result in slower speeds and larger separations.
<P>
I would be interested in hearing more details of the crash and in the
backup procedures.]

There was an article in the Saturday San Francisco Chronicle with the

appears to be yet another sad tale of inner-city violence with no relation
to computer RISKS.  However, buried in the middle of the article is the
statement, "The source also said that the slain officer was found sitting in
his patrol vehicle and may have been using his patrol car computer at the

<P>
Could it be that the visual and mental concentration required to operate a

I heard an item on the BBC radio 4 news last week that set me wondering
about stock-control systems.  The story described the arrest of an alleged
supermarket blackmailer.  He was arrested for planting (fake) bombs in
supermarkets.  The reporter went on to say that he had been caught because
the police had been able to trace him as the owner of the shoebox used in
one of the fake bombs.
<P>
It seems to me that the police must have traced the stock number on the box
down the distribution chain using the shoemakers computer systems.  Once
they determined which shop it was sold from they must have used the shop's
stock control system to determine when it was sold.  In order for the police
to determine who bought the shoes (and the box) the arrestee must have used
a means of payment (e.g., credit card) that included his name.
<P>
I applaud police actions to catch a blackmailer, and I assume that there is
more evidence against him to support their case. But I can't help wondering
where all those shoeboxes I threw away are now, and who is doing what with
them?
<P>
Is there a risk here? It depends on you. If you

On Friday, 7 April 1995, KNOW (the St. Paul, Minnesota, National Public
Radio affiliate) reported that a jewelry store in St. Cloud had been
burglarized.  In order to circumvent the jewelry store's alarm the thief
first broke into an adjacent florist's shop.  He then used a pickaxe to hack
his way through an interior wall into the jewerly store.
<P>
He looted the store at his leisure and fled leaving no prints or other
evidence behind--except the pickaxe.  A sharp-eyed police officer noticed a
barcode sticker was still attached to the pickaxe.  The officer took the
tool to a local hardware store and had the owner scan the code into his
register (the reporter did not say if the officer visited multiple hardware
stores).  Voila! The pickaxe had been sold the day before the burglary.  By
matching the time of sale as recorded in the register's database to the time
stamp on the store's video-surveillance tapes a clear picture of the
suspected burglar was obtained.  At air time he had not yet been
apprehended.

&lt; Abstracted from The Oregonian, 12 Apr 1995, Section B, page 1 &gt;
<P>
Computer software used to track blood supplies in about 250 blood banks has
been recalled because of the possibility that it could allow the release of
contaminated blood.
<P>
Among the problems with the software:
<UL>
	<LI>Untested blood donated by a person for his or her own use
	  could be release for general transfusions.
<P>
	<LI>Blood that should be quarantined while being test could remain
	  available for use !!if two computer users changed its
	  status at the same time!! &lt;emphasis added&gt;
<P>
	<LI>The status of a donor whose blood should not be used,
	  after being updated, could revert to its former status,
	  resulting in blood from an ineligible donor being used.
</UL>
It sounds like inadequate test methods are being used to test the
software, given the classic mistake in the second item above...
<P>
The FDA caught the errors in an inspection of Informedics (which
is doing business as Western Star), the Lake Oswego, Oregon company 
that produces the software.
<P>
John Torici, president of Informedics, said that his company
has about 250 clients in six countries, "and in the 12 years
we've in in the business they've processed literally millions
of units of blood and there has never been an incident of
bad blood being released as a result of our software"
<P>
Other countries don't have our sort system that makes everyone
here eager to sue.  Is this a good measure of software quality, 
given the obvious mistakes made above?

Does the FDA use adequate software testing methods?

It can be risky to install old software on newer systems.
<P>
Among the many problems Microsoft Windows has it the problem of keeping up
with the latest device drivers. This problem is especially troublesome for
multimedia cards and drivers, which are usually installed in the
\WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory.  My own system has mostly 1994 versions of system
software and drivers (but it is still Windows 3.1).
<P>
The other day, I was looking for some trivia information about the "Sound of
Music" (did it get an Oscar for best song?), and none of my usual references
had the answer.  I did have a copy of Microsoft's Cinemania 1992, which I
haven't used since I got my current machine. So I thought, OK, simple, I'll
just install it to find the answer (No -- best songs are for original
scripts, not adapted -- it did get Best Scoring for Adapted Works).
<P>
I got my trivia answer, and things seemed fine, but they weren't.  Because
multimedia has always been one of the big problem areas of Windows, and the
1992 Cinemania had some drivers that were "better", it seems that it blindly
took its "latest" 1992 versions and replaced the existing drivers in the
\WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory without taking into account that it might be 1995
now. (It didn't ask for any confirmation - it just overwrote!)  So, the next
time I booted my system, my sound was broken. It took me a couple of hours
to diagnose the problem and get the current drivers reinstalled, and I know
what I'm doing -- pity the poor new or casual user.
<P>
The RISK -- don't forget today's news is tomorrow's history.  While
Microsoft might have been trying to be helpful in 1992, they forgot that
someone just might use it in 1995.  All very irritating!

From: <A HREF="mailto:graff@liberty.Eng.Sun.COM">graff@liberty.Eng.Sun.COM</A> ( Mark Graff )
Newsgroups: comp.security.unix
Subject: About the recent Sun "CWS" mailstorm

Last week a great many Sun customers were subjected to a torrent of mail
messages which swamped the Customer Warning Mailing list. Since quite a few
of those folks also read this newsgroup, I thought I would post this apology
and explanation here.
<P>
First, quickly, the current status is:
<OL>
<LI>The "cws" mail alias is once again disabled. The mail cascade is over.
<LI>All requests to be added to or removed from the list have been logged
   and will be executed before we send out the next bulletin.
<LI>We have reviewed the procedural errors which led to the flood of
   messages and taken the steps necessary to prevent a repetition.
</OL>
Now, here is a partial explanation of what happened.
<P>
I maintain a mailing list of people interested in receiving Sun Security
Bulletins. The list has thousands of addresses on it, some of which are
themselves repeater aliases. When I am ready to send out a security
bulletin, I (1) produce a mail alias from the mailing list, (2) active the
mail alias on my machine, (3) send the mail, and (4) deactivate the alias.
<P>
The deactivation step is important. It prevents mailstorms and stops
malefactors from probing my machine in an SMTP dialog to obtain a list of
bulletin recipients. This step was omitted when we sent out our bulletins
last week; so, when a recipient replied, asking to be removed from the
list--and cc'ed the "<A HREF="mailto:cws@liberty.sun.com">cws@liberty.sun.com</A>" alias--the fuse was lit. When
others sent responses to that request to the same mailing list, the
mailstorm was launched.
<P>
In a second procedural error, the next day, no one who could deactivate the
list was watching the traffic. So what would have been an annoyance turned
into a real donnybrook. Of course as soon as the right people got the right
message the alias was deactivated, stopping the cascade of messages.
<P>
The problem was exacerbated by the fact that (appearances to the contrary) I
handle list requests manually, as a security measure. One correspondent, not
aware of this, sent several dozen "unsubscribe me" messages to the entire
list in an attempt to escape the cascade. This resulted in the creation of
thousands of additional messages.
<P>
I am responsible, and will apologize personally to as many customers as I
can. In the meantime, please understand that this was the result of human
errors and a good measure of bad luck--not a bad policy, or a lack of
interest on our part.
<P>
I would also like to express my thanks to the many people who, unaware of
the exact nature of the problem, suggested technical solutions. As of this
moment I am not planning any changes in the handling of the mailing list,
which we operated with no problems for several years before the incident
last week. We are of course reviewing alternatives.

</ADDRESS>
<I>Mon, 10 Apr 1995 19:17:46 -0400 (EDT)</I><P>

While writing an article about digital cash, a number of new risks occurred
to me.  If truly safe, secure, and private digital cash can be created,
legitimate businesses will not be the only originations to avoid the
problems of transporting large amounts of cash.  The classic suitcases full
of cash will be replaced by a smart card or credit transfer that will look
just like any other.  To transfer a few million to an offshore bank, you
just make a call.  For additional security, multiple transactions might be
sent from pay phones, cellular phones, and/or sent through an ever changing
list of dummy corporations, forwarded phones, etc.  The information could be
hidden in legitimate data transfers, or just carried.  After all, one smart
card will look just like any other, no matter how much money is inside.  Or
the guts could be removed from the card and hidden nearly anywhere.  Spies,
etc. will love this new money.
<P>
This particular risk will depend to some extent on just how private digital
cash becomes.  If it is really an advanced debit card system with
encryption, privacy will depend on the ability to get a card without
supplying large amounts of personal information.  If ID is required only the
criminals will have privacy.  After all they don't mind lying, don't have
fixed addresses, and the risks are minor compared to those they normally
face.  If the card or account numbers are tracked to deal with theft, fraud,
etc., then they will be available to the IRS etc. Of course this information
will only be available to the "proper" authorities ... and anyone who knows
who to bribe. Also since the cards or what ever, will inevitably have an
account number, public key, or other identifier, it won't be long before
someone starts connecting paid for by account xxxx and sent to address yyy,
and there goes privacy.
<P>
On the other hand, people are ingenious, and many will be highly motivated.
Black market cards and/or accounts will exist.  The listed owners might even
be real, illegal aliens, little old ladies with nothing to lose, or totally
fictitious.  When the cards or accounts become international, whole new
worlds of villainy open up.
<P>
The very definition of a bank may change.  Most banking is already an
exercise in data processing.  Without the need for a vault and tellers, the
whole thing might be run from an advanced laptop.  The notion of offshore
banks might take on a new meaning, when the bank might be mobile, or
distributed over large distances and many jurisdictions.
<P>
New, unforeseen risks are also inevitable.  When paper money replaced
coinage, inflation became almost inevitable.  Not that many kingdoms or
countries could long resist adulterating the coinage, but I know of no paper
money that hasn't suffered inflation.  One possible example of the new risks
involves check float.  Entire industries exist to exploit the time between a
check being issued and when it clears.  What happens when float, and checks,
go the way of the Dodo?  What happens to the Swiss banking industry if
numbered accounts are no longer necessary?  What happens to the IRS if
everybody effectively has a numbered account?

A common theme in this forum is how computers can create dismay out of
order. For instance, I've always considered FedEx to be far superior to the
Post Office because you their computer system tracks the packages to the
correct destination. Today's WSJ (April 11, 1995, B1) offers a story
describing how lawyers routinely subpoena FedEx for these same computerized
shipping records. The article mentions a tobacco researcher who had his
FedEx shipments subpoenaed by a tobacco company interested in his
correspondence.
<P>
Being a curious and frequent customer of Federal Express, I called up their
legal department to find out if anyone had been subpoenaing my shipping
records. This seemed to upset them because they get 300-500 subpoenas a day
and their data base just wasn't set up to look for my name. They did tell me
that they can only offer proof of delivery and copies of the airbills
generated from microfiche. These do not arrive overnight, however, because
it takes them 2-6 weeks to process each court order. Oh, they did mention in
passing that they don't keep any records of cash transactions.

&gt;    Throughout the execution, the computer's systems monitor the current,<BR>
&gt;    making sure there is no drop in power.
<P>
I am aghast -- it sounds just like the technology used in ground-fault
interruptors, those nifty gadgets that turn off the current if you you drop
a plugged-in appliance into the tub with you.  But instead, this system
keeps the current on until its victim has shunted a sufficiently lethal
dose.
<P>
I suppose the lesson is that one person will always find a way to use a
technology for the exact opposite purpose that another person was designing
it for.  And I suppose that computer programmers and electricians have
already build lots of systems that have already intentionally killed more
people than this electric-chair-controller will ever get a chance to do.
But dammit, is this what folks had in mind back when they were inventing
embedded controller systems, analog-to-digital converters,
silicon-controlled rectifiers and the other doodads that this execution
system must use?

A previous anonymous poster [in <A HREF="/Risks/17.04.html">RISKS-17.04</A>] took some heat by calling the
authors of the "Satan" security software "amoral".  While that point may be
arguable, how about another term that is harder to argue: "inept", or
perhaps "sloppy"?
<P>
Since the original much-heralded release of Satan, CERT has had to send out
two bulletins warning of serious bugs in the original version, and in the
succeeding version that was supposed to fix the bugs in the first version.
In each case, the bugs were of the sort that INTRODUCED security holes where
none had existed before.  And of course each new version checks to see if it
can exploit the security bugs introduced by the previous version--so if you
ever stop updating you're really in for a surprise!
<P>
It doesn't even appear that the bugs were terribly obscure--it looks more
like a rush job with inadequate testing.
<P>
Great security software.  If you had a secure system before starting to work
with Satan, you can end up with an insecure system afterwards.  It's
difficult to think of a much less desirable scenario.
<P>
Such sloppiness in widely distributed software that is supposed to help
solve important security problems is hard to rationalize, to put things
politely.

The recent discussions of typos in databases, etc. remind me of a problem
that I have noticed with the on line catalog for the library at Portland
State University.  Shortly before I started my Computer Security class last
year, I decided to check the library's holdings in the area by using the on
line catalog.  I was somewhat surprised when a subject search using the
subject "computer security" turned up very little.  Not even Dorothy
Denning's classic book was found.  Looking up a few books by author or title
and checking the index terms indicated that the appropriate search is
"access control."  There does not seem to be a way to reindex entries or to
add cross references.  One wonders how many searches go awry because of
counter intuitive search terms.
<P>
PSU's catalog system has another interesting "feature."  It is impossible to
get out of the system.  It was apparently designed for dedicated terminals
where the notion of termination or disconnection was considered
inappropriate and when you connect to it via telnet you must escape to
telnet and close the connection when you are done.

Jerry Leichter had a problem finding a book which he did not know the exact
author or title.  His story shows that a human can perform pattern searching
faster then a computer to find the book, but this isn't always the case.
The problem with the computer was poor database retrieval.
<P>
I had a similar experience years ago at a library looking for a book I had
seen for a few moments, but had forgotten the author, title, and catalog
number.  However, I remembered the first letter of the author's last name
and the general subject.  When I used the "friendly" public machines at the
library to search for the book, I had no luck.  Rather than scan books in the
relevant section of the library, I went to the computer services department
and talked to a friend in the library's computer department.
<P>
By accessing the database through a "computerese" interface, I was able to
search the entire database for books within a section of the library (by a
range of Library of Congress numbers), first letter of the author's last
name, and three possible subject keywords.
<P>
The computer found two entries matching my request; one was my book.
<P>
Risks?  The "friendly" interface, while increasing general use among the
public, lacks the power of a "computerese" interface.  The users'
perceptions about the power and ease-of-use of computers and databases
become clouded because of an attempt to show them the power of same.

Even if you do have the correct information at hand, you are relying upon
the competence of the database designer.
<P>
A few days ago I tried to order a book.  I knew the names of both the authors,
the title of the book, and the publisher.  The only information I was lacking
was the ISBN.
<P>
"No problem" I thought, since most of the bookshops here in Cambridge now
have access to an online catalogue of all books on sale in the UK.
<P>
The shop assistant typed in the correct query (here I should explain that it
wasn't her fault since, by looking over her shoulder, I could see that she
typed everything correctly).  The computer said that there were no matching
entries.  She then tried widening the search by missing out some of the
information.
<P>
Even when asked for all books written by either author the system claimed
that nothing existed.  Since I was certain of the publisher she agreed to
phone them.  They claimed it didn't exist, although I knew it did since I
had reviewed it for a journal.  They then found that their paper list didn't
correspond to the computer list - it was listed on paper.  Given the ISBN we
checked again on the bookshop's system.  Sure enough, there was the book
with all of the details as I had given them.
<P>
The book is now on order.  However, if we hadn't persisted, the bookshop,
and the publisher, and the authors, would have lost a sale.
<P>
Failure to order a book may seem an unimportant problem, but it made both me
and colleagues wonder how many relational databases aren't, and what are the
consequences.

Mark L. Farley, 34, of Lowell, was arrested on 9 Apr 1995.  Working as an
orthopedic technician in the Newton-Wellesley Hospital, he allegedly
accessed a former employee's computer account to search through 954
confidential files of patients (mostly young females) for telephone numbers,
which he then used to make obscene calls.  (He had pleaded guilty in 1984 to
raping an eight-year-old girl in Erving.)  He is apparently the first person
to be charged under a new Massachusetts statute that makes it a criminal
offense to use someone else's password to gain access to a computer system.
He is also accused of stealing hospital trade secrets, and making obscene or
annoying telephone calls -- apparently from the hospital.  [Source: Hospital
Worker Charged under New Massachusetts Password Law By MATTHEW BRELIS, *The
Boston Globe*, 12 Apr 1995.]

I just received this peach from a friend at a local multi-million dollar
computer company (after their phone was busy all day).  They recently had
some layoffs, but frankly it sounds like their problems started long before
that:
<P>
&gt; My phone isn't really busy.  There's a little problem at ******* today.<BR>
&gt; They were doing some facilities work in one of the labs and<BR>
&gt; accidentally set off the earthquake detector.  Since earthquakes tend to<BR>
&gt; set off the indoor sprinkler system, the earthquake detectors shut off <BR>
&gt; electrical.  This lab happened to share some wiring with the phone system,<BR>
&gt; and nobody knows how to reset it.  This is one of those little gaps that<BR>
&gt; got left with the layoff.
<P>
The Risks of not having detailed instructions for disaster recovery are
apparent.  The question of why a lab is sharing power with the main phone
system is a sub-Risk left for the student.
<P>
While I'm at it, just why would you design an earthquake detection system
that didn't require two or more significantly separated points for
verification?  Local shocks from people dropping heavy objects are
relatively common...

You've heard of Fly-by-Wire? well what about Fugue-By-Wire! The UK New
Scientist magazine, 15 April 1995, reports that Notre Dame's organ is not
suitable for concerts following a two year restoration costing =A31.3
million (Pounds Sterling) in which six computers were installed to relay the
organist's instructions from the manuals (keyboards) and pedals to the organ
pipes.  The cathedral's administrator has cancelled all concerts as a series
of malfunctions, including `memory failure', has caused the organ (as he is
reported as saying) `to suddenly stop working. It takes five to ten minutes
to get it going again. This is too stressful for the organists who never
know when it will happen'! It is still used for Mass, however, as when it
`crashes' a small organ fills in the unintented silence.  JS Bach should
have been warned that his `Toccata &amp; Fugue in D Minor' would be too `memory
intensive' for organs of the future!

Eleven Electronic Bulletin Board Systems Dismantled<BR>
(From A Royal Canadian Mounted Police news release)
<P>
Montreal, April 12, 1995 - Seventeen searches conducted in the Greater 
Montreal area by the Copyright Investigations Unit of the Montreal RCMP 
Federal Enforcement Section put an end to the operation of eleven 
electronic bulletin board systems (BBS).
<P>
Since 6 o'clock this morning, 75 RCMP members have been dismantling bulletin
boards specialized in circulating copyrighted Canadian software such as Le
Correcteur 101, CorelDraw, Winfax PRO, as well as products developed by
Audodes [Autodesk?], Borland, Clark Development, DataStorm, Disney, IBM,
Lotus, Microsoft, Windows 95, Mustang Software, Novell, Playboy,
Quarterdeck, Sierra, Symantec and many other firms.
<P>
Computers and peripherals worth more than one hundred thousand dollars were
seized, along with millions of dollars of pirated software.
<P>
This is the most important operation of this kind yet in Canada against 
illicit bulletin board systems.
<P>

About 15 persons will appear in court at a later date to face charges 
under the Copyright Act which sets out severe penalties for offenders:
<UL><LI>	6 months and/or $25,000.00 per count for summary conviction 
	offenses;
<LI>	2 years and/or $1,000,000.00 per count for indictable offenses.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	Major Strike by the RCMP in the InfoBahn<BR>
	[Gros coup de la GRC dans l'inforoute]
<P>
	by Eric Trottier, La Presse
<P>
	The RCMP has decided to do a little house-cleaning in the
	joyously anarchic world of the electronic highway.
<P>
	Thanks to a computer-science infiltration operation, the 
	federal police yesterday dismantled 11 bulletin boards that
	were trafficking in tens of thousands of software packages
	around the world.
<P>
	"It's the first time we have been able to implement this type
	of penetration of BBSs.  Even in the U.S., the most important
	dragnet of this type has so far only allowed the dismantling of
	six BBSs at a time," said Sergeant Serge Corriveau to La Presse
	shortly after the investigators completed more than a dozen
	penetrations and seized more than C$200,000 [U$140,000] of
	computer equipment.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Key points from the article:
<UL>
<LI>	News of the raid spread rapidly through the Internet;

<P><LI>	The 11 BBSs were involved in large-scale fraud in N.America 
	and Europe.  Subscription fees of C$30-C$50 per month allowed
	participants to download copies of proprietary software at will.

<P><LI>	"Everything available legally on the market was offered by these
	BBSs," said Sgt Corriveau.

<P><LI>	Some of the more audacious BBSs offered beta copies of Windows95.

<P><LI>	There are about 700 BBSs in the greater Montreal area; the RCMP
	estimate that three-quarters of them traffic in stolen software.

<P><LI>	Some of the BBS have become virtual flea markets of pornography,
	bomb-making instructions, and details of how to succeed at suicide.

<P><LI>	In one of the shut-down systems, stolen goods and illegal assault
	weapons were advertised for sale.

<P><LI>	It has taken a year to infiltrate the BBSs; some officers had to 
	wait up to four months to gain entrance to the inner areas of the
	boards they were investigating.

<P><LI>	The raids involved 75 officers in Montreal, Outremont, Repentigny,
	Longueuil, Saint-Amable, and the St-Jerome area.

<P><LI>	The BBSs shut down are:  Notice, Twins, Red Alert, Perfect Crime,
	Beyond Corruption, Line-Up, Wolf Pack, On the World, Restricted Area
	and Necromancer Mecon.

<P><LI>	Most had about 6 telephone lines for full-time access, serving 
	100-250 clients, with some in Europe.  The larges, Notice, had 
	350 clients who each paid $50/month, for an untaxed revenue of 
	C$210,000 per year.

<P><LI>	The police estimate that 11 to 15 criminal hackers will be 
	indicted as a result of the raids.  They each face fines of
	C$25,000 to C$100,000.

&gt;The RISK -- don't forget today's news is tomorrow's history.  While<BR>
&gt;Microsoft might have been trying to be helpful in 1992, they forgot that<BR>
&gt;<EM>someone just might use it in 1995</EM>.  All very irritating!
<P>
Of course not. Everyone would have switched to Win 95 by then...
<P>
Maybe there is a RISK here. Suppose a software developer finds problems in
some current version of a program, but instead of sending out an immediate
bug-fix (with all its attendant negative publicity), elects to wait until
the next major version release before including the fixes. If this release
is then delayed, are users then left using broken software for longer than
is necessary?

&gt;Could it be that the visual and mental concentration required to <BR>
&gt;operate a computer can constitute a potentially fatal distraction <BR>
&gt;for a police officer?
<P>
Depends on the situation.  It would be foolish to begin using the computer
when you knew you were in a tactical situation that demanded keen awareness
of your surroundings.  However, a cop who spent his entire shift worrying
about being ambushed by someone with a high-powered rifle would, I should
imagine, have a brief, ineffective, possibly even dangerous career en route
to a psych disability.
<P>
But perhaps there is a risk, related to the way a computer sucks your
attention into a black hole where space and time have little meaning.  A cop
who pulls over into some secluded area to finish up his paperwork might well
face a less absorbing task that lets him monitor what's going on outside the
car.
<P>
There's a RISK much more probable than getting ambushed, though.  I became
aware of it while watching "Cops" on the bread-and-circuses dispenser one
night. Our hero was driving along a city street at a pretty good clip while
in a complete heads-down mode, using the computer.  Had there been a bicycle
or baby buggy in front of the car, the screeching noise from underneath the
axle would've been his first clue that something was wrong.

The story relating to the murder of an Oakland Cop, who was slain while
using in car-computer, brings another "interesting" RISK to mind.
<P>
Since the cop was murdered while using the computer, it is safe to assume
that the cop was properly signed into the system, when he died.  The
criminal could have used the computer to access police files, perhaps alter
them, or otherwise infiltrate the system and violate the integrity of the
computer system.

In response to Erik Kraft's message about the lack of power inherent to many
"user friendly" interfaces:
<P>
This sort of thing happens quite frequently; it's one of the reasons why I
won't touch Window &amp; Mac machines, while I love UNIX.  The typical problem
is that it's much easier to implement a "computerese" interface (which
requires little design) than to design &amp; implement a worthwhile
user-friendly interface *that has the same flexibility*.
<P>
The risks?  Building software upon software that doesn't allow complete
flexibility!  Eventually *something* is going to break, and if low-level and
flexible configuration/command ability isn't available, the only person
who's going to be able to fix it will be the original programmer.
<P>
Perhaps some advice: build the graphics interface to critical utilities on
TOP of a flexible command-line system, not concurrent with it.
<P>
[obRisks: since I don't deal with inflexible user interfaces any more, I don't
 have any recent examples of this sort of thing.  The most relevant one I
 can think of is the (old?) NeXTStep graphical system manager interface.
 Once I deleted the NetInfo database, and (after browsing the manual pages
 in single user mode for several hours) had to reinstall the entire system.
 It's virtually impossible to change the system using the command-line
 utilities. ]

Erik Kraft responds to my comment about the advantage of "human search" of
available computer search techniques in finding a book in a library listing
by describing a similar problem he had, which he was able to solve by talking
to a friend at the computer center and gaining access to the "computerese"
interface.
<P>
Curiously, when I first described my problem to a friend who uses the same
library, he pointed out that the programs involved provided two interfaces:
The "easy to use" hierarchical menu system meant for customers, and the
higher-powered system meant for librarians.  The particular search I needed
could, indeed, have been done fairly easily from a librarian's terminal.
<P>
But this illustrates another aspect of the same risk.  Most people don't have
friends at the computer center, or even know librarians who will let them use
the "privileged" interface.  The only interface available to them is the
"public" interface, which in the interest of ease-of-use by a population who
have no reason, time, or desire to "learn about this fancy computer stuff",
has been deliberately limited in its capabilities.
<P>
I recall a discussion I had a number of years back with Alan Perlis.  (Alan
was a wonderful person with a very broad range of interest and insights, so
this isn't as odd as it will sound.)  I had just been trying to buy a wood
trash can.  I couldn't find any - just cheap metal and cheap molded plastic
"fake wood".  I commented that technological advances sometimes lowered the
quality of the products one could find.  Alan's response was that, no, I was
looking at it wrong.  Pre-technology, most people could only afford to buy
low-quality versions of a product; the reasonably well off could buy
higher-quality versions.  Technology - particularly automation - made it
possible to raise the quality of the cheap stuff.  This eliminated both the
older forms of the product: The real junk was no cheaper to produce than the
better post-technology product so couldn't compete; and the former
"reasonable quality" was now much more expensive, and only a bit better.
Often, a new "super-high-quality" stratum came into being as well - where
"quality" often really means "snob appeal" - but at much, much higher
prices.  (Sometimes this already existed and simply continued; sometimes
not).  For the relatively less well off, technology provides better products
for equal or less cost.  For the very well off, it makes little difference.
But there is a range in the middle who actually lose ground.
<P>
We are seeing a similar effect in these library interfaces.  For the vast
majority of people, who rarely use the library systems and have no need to
do anything sophisticated when they *do* use them, they are a clear step
forward.  Those people who are "wealthy" by virtue of having special access
and knowledge at worst break even, and often gain.  But there are those in
the middle for whom the new technologies are a step backward.  Library
systems are not alone - those of us who, for example, are used to writing
command files or shell scripts to accomplish sophisticated things find GUI
interfaces frustrating.  More and more systems are "sealed" - at least Mr.
Kraft's friend in the library computer center could give him access to a
low-level interface.  What happens when the only access is through a Web
server that no one can log onto?  You get the services it chooses to give
you, period.

I've long been a bit disturbed by the trend toward distributing software

a WWW site.  Here is an example of how this arrangement can go wrong:

Note that there is a mirror of the NCSA documentation at

have made a commitment to keep the mirror up to date (nothing at the
VTLS site mentions version httpd_1.3R+).  This highlights another risk
of online documentation: without a careful versioning scheme, it is
easy to find oneself fetching documentation for a different version of
the software than the code at hand.

Cliff Stoll makes an excellent critique of online catalogs in his new book
_Silicon Snake Oil_. He enumerates many of the criticisms that contributors
to RISKS have discussed.
<P>
I recently ran into a problem with the online catalog for the library where
I work. Asking to see the card catalog, I was told that it was 2-3 years out
of date. The online catalog that replaced it accessed classified information
and was therefore unavailable for general use. The librarian had to perform
the search for me. Since I was looking for a specific book, it was not a
problem. On the other hand, if I was doing more general research, I would
have been stymied.

People seem upset by the use of a computer to control an electric chair.
While I agree that electrocution is horrifying, nobody has identified the
computer-related risk.  The claimed "risk" seems to be that computers and
other electronic devices are being used to kill.  But how do the inventors
of those gadgets feel about the fruits of their labor being used by military
forces?
<P>
The obvious actual risk is that the computer might make more mistakes
than human executioners, or might make worse ones.  But the human
executioners apparently already have a record of botched executions,
so a proper assessment would have to weigh the risks on both sides.
<P>
Of course a better solution might be to do away with electrocutions
altogether, but that debate doesn't concern the use of computers.

The following, from the 17 April Government Computer News, highlights the
risks from inadequate configuration control:
<P>
"An audit of the $26 billion federal employees' Thrift Savings Plan found
that ineffective control of software development has left the plan
vulnerable to processing interruptions and may have compromised its data
integrity."
<P>
The article notes that the audit found:
"- Between 1990 and 1993, more than 800 changes were made annually to
   the software.<BR>
"- About 85 percent of 1993 updates, mandated or emergency changes,
   bypassed upfront quality assurance database testing.<BR>
"- Comprehensive quality assurance testing was rarely performed.
"- Six programmers, 17 percent, accounted for more than 40 percent of all 
   1992 and 1993 TSP software changes, for which there was little
   documentation."

	DUBLIN, April 13 (Reuter) - A remote Irish Roman Catholic church
	ran up an 800 pound ($1,300) bill to a telephone sex service, but
	the local cleric says none of his priests was involved.

The article explains that someone stole dial tone from the cordless phone 
and placed the calls from outside the church.  The cordless phone is no
longer on line.  The church had to pay the phone bill.

Starring Gene Hacker, Sissy Cyberspacek; Hollywood Has Plugged

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  What do you get if you cross Hollywood with Silicon Valley?  Siliwood?
<P>
  Last summer, Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock romanced each other as they
  foiled terrorists in the blockbuster action film "Speed." But this year,
  the two sex symbols are starring in big-budget movies cozying up to
  computer chips.
<P>
  Tinseltown is churning out a slew of cyberspace films and television shows
  built around people and computers. The slate of offerings grows daily, as
  the industry's creative minds focus on making the Internet worldwide
  network of computers thrilling, the illegal exploits of a notorious hacker
  gripping and hard disks sexy.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The author explains that Hollywood can't resist taking advantage of the
growing media hyperbole explosion about cyberspace.
<P>
Some of the upcoming releases to watch [out] for:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	..."Johnny Mnemonic," based on the William Gibson novel about a 
	high-tech courier -- played by Reeves -- with a memory chip 
	embedded in his head.
<P>
	Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.'s "The Net," ... will star 
	Bullock as a shy computer systems analyst tossed "headlong 
	into the middle of a murderous web of corruption and conspiracy"
	after she takes her keyboard where it shouldn't go.
<P>
	United Artists Entertainment Co. in the fall will release 
	"Hackers," which is being flacked as a "cyberpunk thriller" 
	whose protagonists have "awesome power at their fingertips."
<P>
	Walt Disney Co. reportedly is developing "f2f (face to face)" 
	about an on-line serial killer. 
<P>
	Fox Television recently launched "VR.5" and "Sliders," whose

It seems John Markoff is deluged with requests for movie rights to his
forthcoming book about Kevin Mitnick.
<P>
[Comments from MK: Oh, good, just what we needed: "Mommy, mommy, I wanna
grow up to be like Kevin Mitnick!"  Readers of RISKS and participants in the
NCSA Forum on CompuServe may want to limber up their typing fingers and get
ready to protest the glorification of criminal hackers that will likely be
part of Hollywood's portrayal of people like Mitnick.  It would be useful to
be in the early showings of the films and write reviews for newspapers
countering the errors of fact and emphasis we are likely to see.]

The opponents of floating-point representation for time have done an
insufficient analysis.  About twenty years ago I was part of a research
group doing extensive time series analysis of weather and related data.  We
needed a good way to represent time.  Fortunately we had a few astronomers
on the team, so time was reasonably well understood.
<P>
We chose "second of century", using a double precision floating point
representation.  Analysis showed that this would preserve millisecond
accuracy for the span of interest.  (Actually for all of recorded history
and more.)  Since we usually were satisfied with one minute accuracy this
seemed sufficient.  There was a brief debate about using a better time base,
but 12:00:01 AM GMT, 1 January, 1901 was easy to explain to everyone.  There
are a few applications that need better than millisecond precision, but for
most of the worlds applications double precision floating point will provide
enough precision for the next few millenia.  (A simple test for those who
are unsure about their needs.  Do you compensate for the variations in the
rate of the Earth's rotation?  If not, you probably don't need millisecond
accuracy.)
<P>
This notation had some interesting side effects.  At the time, floating 
point turned out to be somewhat faster than 64-bit integers due to a 
quirk of hardware.  It also led to excellent compatibility with the 
other time series processing.  Time was just another well behaved 
variable.  This notation eliminated a lot of the mistakes made by the 
typical programmer who is ignorant of traditional time notations and 
their problems.  There could have been some round-off issues, but we 
rarely did any arithmetic other than addition or subtraction of two 
times, where millisecond accuracy is maintained.  It even led to a 
simple notation for interval time span data, e.g. "0.01 inches of rain 
fell between 1633 and 1647 on ...", which is how many meteorological 
measurements are made.
<P>
The difficult problems were in translation to and from local.  The most
severe problem was the inherent ambiguity of local time in recent decades. 
There are two true times corresponding to each time in the one hour of
overlap when Daylight Savings shifts back to Standard.  Correctly
resolving this ambiguity was always a headache.  Fortunately most 
professional measurements have been recorded in UTC, or GMT before UTC 
was defined.
<P>
A word of caution, double precision floating point is suitable for an 
internal representation of UTC, or "absolute" time.  You have to do your 
own analysis if you are interested in timing relative to some event.

&gt; a barcode sticker was still attached to the pickaxe.  
<P>
Talk about risky ways of going about things! Store barcodes don't identify
individual items. All you can determine from the barcode is that the
hardware store sold *a* pickaxe. You *might* know what hardware store sold
it (if it was a store barcode and not applied by the pickaxe manufacturer),
but you can't know which pickaxe it was.
<P>
Fundamentally, you'll only ever see barcodes that can identify a particular
instance if there would be something else that would identify that object.
For instance, truck axles have individual barcodes; those simply repeat the
individually tracked serial numbers truck axles have always had. Products
sold by weight, like cheese and meat, may also have individual barcodes that
incorporate the weight.
<P>
Normally, the barcode doesn't even incorporate all the available information
about the object. It's a pure product code. A can of green beans has a
barcode label that says it's a can of green beans, and the register tape
will reflect that. The same can also has a lot number, so if you drop dead
after you eat it, the canning company has some way of figuring out what
other cans of green beans might be poisonous. The lot number is *not*
encoded in the barcode, and you wouldn't be able to find it from the
register information, because the grocery store really doesn't care.
<P>
I assume that the article is leaving out a lot of information (for instance,
that the pickaxe had the name of the hardware store on it, too, and the
hardware store only sold one pickaxe recently). But I'm always amazed how
willing people are to present barcodes as magic identifiers, and believe
that they function that way. Perhaps it's because they look funny and aren't
readable by eye?

<P>
Kathy Marks in the Telegraph reports that a large supermarket chain has paid
substantial damages to a policeman whose description was circulated between
stores by electronic mail after he complained about a joint of meat.
<P>
Apparently, the E-mail message was headed "Refund fraud -- urgent, urgent
urgent" and gave an account of his complaint, together with details of his
appearance and car registration.  The policeman only found out about the
message when he visited a local branch of the store to give advice about
security.  A friend who works there showed him a print out of the message on
an internal noticeboard.
<P>
The policeman is quoted: "...If this had got out unchecked it could have
done me serious professional harm.  I am in a position of extreme trust and
there has got to be no doubt...that I am 100 percent trustworthy".
<P>
His lawyer said that the out-of-court settlement amounted to "thousands,
rather than hundreds" (of pounds).

The April issue of the Communications of the ACM is all about Digital
Libraries.  More than one of the authors there alluded to the great Library
that was founded in Alexandria by the Egyptian king Ptolemy I.  One group
even calls its project "alexandria".  This library was one of the wonders of
the ancient world; it contained more than 700,000 volumes at its peak.  The
CACM writers are optimistic that digital technology can be as much of a
monument to the advancement of human knowledge as the Alexandrian Library
was in its day.
<P>
The other major topic of April's CACM issue is the ACM's new Electronic
Publication Plan, which details a carefully thought-out set of rules for
copying and citation of electronic documents and the status of hyperlinks to
World Wide Web documents as citations (the ACM's position) or plagiaristic
quoted inclusions (they rejected this view).  The transmission of an
electronic document from archive to reader poses important questions about
the nature of copying to authors and publishers who expect royalties from
the sale of their work, which the ACM appears to have succeeded in balancing
against the cultural and technical difficulties of applying a pay-per-use
paradigm to information resources released onto the Internet.
<P>
But the ACM policymakers appear to have missed one of the great lessons of
the Alexandrian Library.  According to my encyclopedia (*), the library was
kept in two buildings: one of these was a famous museum, which was destroyed
by fire during the siege of Alexandria by Julius Caesar.  The other part of
the library was kept in the temple of Jupiter Serapis, where during the
reign of Theodosius the Great, "a mob of fanatic Christians, led on by the
Archbishop Theophilus, stormed and destroyed the temple, together, it is
most likely, with the greater part of its literary treasures, in 391 A.D."
<P>
	The Alexandrian Library had endured for over 700 years, yet when it
was destroyed, it was an enormous loss to humanity since its contents
existed in only single copies, because of the difficulty in duplicating
them.  Some historians have gone as far as crediting its destruction as a
principal cause of the Dark Ages that afflicted Europe for the next thousand
years.
<P>
The ACM Electronic Publishing Plan does not propose any measures to assure
the survivability or integrity of electronic publications against disaster
or terrorism.  Along with the ease of copying an electronic document comes
great ease in modifying its content undetectably.
<P>
Perhaps a greater risk comes from simple financial pressures.  Electronic
documents must be maintained on functioning computer systems.  When funds
run short, the temptation will be enormous to purge infrequently-accessed
documents from the database in order to reduce maintenance costs, or to
forgo copying them to new media when upgrade time arrives.
<P>
	I wrote the thesis for my Master's degree as an electronic document.
I still have the original, but it's on a PDP-10 format DECtape.  Where can I
find a machine capable of reading this tape twenty years later?  What's to
prevent this from happening to the contents of entire digital libraries?

The March issue of Security Management magazine reports that manufacturers
are testing some sort of nonlethal weapon designed to deliver a "high
frequency pulse" that would disable any unshielded electronic circuitry hit
by the beam -- with the suggestion this would be used somehow by the police.
<P>
Presumably this would be used in a car chase to take out a car's control
circuits, possibly disabling its electronic ignition. I naively imagine a
car's electronics to be fairly well shielded -- the steel shell, the engine
block itself, etc. -- and so this may be quite a powerful pulse (perhaps a
microwave-savvy reader can comment?).
<P>
The article only has a paragraph on this weapon and doesn't explain
the technology. I speculate about a police-car-mounted maser or
perhaps just a conventional microwave transmitter of sufficient power.
<P>
The risks here seem fairly obvious. First of all, risks in the actual effect
of the weapon during a legitimate high speed chase -- can there be any
guarantee that it will only stall the engine? Supposing it takes out the
power steering or activates the air-bags or does some other bizarre and
dangerous thing? Then there is the question of the precise focus of the
beam, and whether it might affect nearby vehicles. Presumably there is no
"tracer" effect, so the shooter doesn't know if the target was hit or not.
<P>
Secondly, assuming that it is a good weapon, i.e., it has good targeting,
only has the effect of stalling the engine or simply reducing engine
performance, etc. then it seems there would be little to prevent any random
microwave-hacker from doing the same thing, relatively indetectably,
especially if the weapon consists solely of a powerful microwave
transmitter.
<P>
Oh, as a side note, the article mentions that the device would be able
to destroy any sort of computer equipment....

Modern sport parachute systems are frequently equipped with an automatic
activation device on the reserve parachute that will initiate deployment of
the reserve if the person descends through a certain altitude whilst
exceeding a certain velocity, i.e., if you're low and falling fast (no
parachute!) it will initiate deployment of your reserve.
<P>
Currently, the most popular AAD (and by far the best made technically) is
the CYPRES. When turned on, it performs a self check that tests the
repeatability of the pressure sensor (to compute altitude), the integrity of
the system, as well as reporting the battery voltage and testing the voltage
on a dummy load. The CYPRES can activate the reserve via a pyrotechnic
cutter, which, when current is applied, fires, and cuts a crucial bit of
line which allows the reserve container to open. The CYPRES has only one
button, and the self-test is performed each time it is turned on, with
feedback to the user of the success or failure of the test.
<P>
CYPRES mandates that batteries be replaced every 500 jumps, 2 years, or when
the self-test fails with a battery-low code, whichever comes first.
<P>
Recently (last two weeks), a CYPRES activated (i.e., the jumper was low and
falling fast), but failed to cut the loop,and the skydiver hit the ground with
no parachutes out. Current reports indicate that:
<BLOCKQUOTE><OL>
	<LI> The selftest was succeeding
	<LI> Battery voltage *as reported by the self test* was in the moderate
	   to high range (6.2 of 5.8-6.3v) 
	<LI> The batteries were 4 years old (2 years beyond their lifetime!)
	<LI> The unit functioned correctly when tested in a chamber with a new
	   battery.
	<LI> The battery apparently lacked sufficient power to heat the wire to 
	   ignite the charge
</OL></BLOCKQUOTE>
A full report by the manufacturer has *not* been issued, so it is possible
that there are errors in this report, however, it is correct the best of my
knowledge. 
<P>
The question: Does violating the *written* guidelines constitute a situation
in which the self-test can *fail* to report the correct status of the unit
-- and should the user be aware of this failure mode?
<P>
The risk: if you build in a self-test that does not in fact cover all
failure modes, you are putting the user at increased risk, as people will
rely on the electronic self-test, rather than the written instructions on
how to use the device. In a life-or-death situation, it is RISKy to provide
a self-test that produces ambiguous results.
<P>
Caveat: CYPRES has been designed to be as user friendly and reliable as
possible. In the 3 years since it has been widely used in the sport,
CYPRES's has been responsible for saving approximately 50 jumpers who would
likely have otherwise died (true positives). There have been no
innapropriate activations (i.e., false negatives). There have (obviously)
been millions of uses where the device has not fired, and it wasn't supposed
to anyways (true negatives). This is the first incidence of a false
positive, where the unit should have fired, and failed to perform.
<P>
Conclusion: Read your manuals, and perform scheduled maintenance even *if*
the self test might imply that it isn't necessary.

MDS 95:  2ND CONFERENCE ON THE MATHEMATICS OF DEPENDABLE SYSTEMS<BR>
4-6 September 1995, University of York, England <BR>
Sponsored by Nuclear Electric<BR>
THE INSTITUTE OF MATHEMATICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS  
<P>
CALL FOR PAPERS (extended deadline) AND APPLICATION FORM  
<P>
The construction of dependable systems, by which we mean systems providing
high levels of reliability, availability, safety and/or security, is a
problem of considerable concern to both providers and users of information
processing systems of all types.  Historically, different aspects of system
dependability (e.g. reliability and security) have been studied quite
independently, albeit that many of the goals are similar.  For example, the
notion of certifying functionality assurance levels applies equally to
reliable systems and secure systems.  In addition, users will often require
some combination of security and fail-safe operation.
<P>
The purpose of MDS 95 is to consider the mathematical aspects of the
provision of dependable systems, one goal being a comparison and possible
unification of mathematical techniques for providing safe, reliable and
secure systems.  A number of different mathematical approaches have been
taken to the overall problem, including probabilistic/statistical reasoning,
formal models of safe, secure and reliable systems and logics of
authentication and access control/privilege delegation.  Papers on all these
areas are solicited, the unifying theme being the application of
mathematical techniques to the overall dependability problem.  Hence papers
will be particularly welcome that cross-fertilise the application domains.
The conference will consider dependability for both hardware and software
systems.
<P>
PROGRAMME AND PROCEEDINGS: The conference will consist of three days of
presentations by contributing authors.  The programme will also include
invited lectures by prominent researchers and practitioners in dependable
systems theory and practice.  Time will be made available for discussions.
A digest of papers will be available to participants during the meeting and
the proceedings will be published after the conference.
<P>
PANEL DISCUSSION: The Panel will be chaired by Dr B Wichmann (National
Physical Laboratory and The Open University) and led by Professor J Rushby
(SRI).  Other members will be announced later.  The main topic will be the
contribution of Formal Methods to certification.

On the day of the bombing of the federal building in OK, some federal
buildings in Boston were evacuated due to bomb scares.  At least one of the
scares was the result of a prank phone call.  The police very quickly
arrested an 18-year-old man, who allegedly placed the call.
<P>
The police have been waiting for several years for a new phone tracing
system.  Currently they have to call NYNEX (the local phone company) and
initiate a trace while a caller is still on the line.  The new system
(scheduled to be put into place hopefully this year) will let the police
trace the call automatically.
<P>
While preparing documents for trial, NYNEX discovered that a technical
operator had transposed a trunk number during the trace, and thus they had
traced the call to the wrong phone number (perhaps traced the wrong call to
the right phone number?).  The accused was released, NYNEX made lots of
apologies including offering a full scholarship with no strings attached,
and the person who made the actual call remains at large.
<P>
Some points to note:
<P>
The current tracing procedure requires manual entry of trunk numbers and
has a very clear failure mode....
<P>
... but NYNEX had enough recorded information to later on determine that
a mistake was made.  (Well done!)
<P>
When the new system is installed, the traces will be entirely automatic.
They might be more reliable, but it's unclear if there will be an audit
trail in the case of failures.  (It sounds like just a software system -- if
there's a bug in the algorithm, how will the algorithm detect it?)  (If
there are ways to spoof the system used to identify the phone number, that
leads another set of problems.)
<P>
There's always the risk of "but the computer says" syndrome.

ComputerWorld 15 Apr 1995 mentions that some early adopters of speech
recognition software are starting to develop voice problems.  In the
article, the vendors minimize the seriousness by suggesting that
inexperienced users tend to talk too loud, and that the problem can be
overcome by voice training.  However, it occurs to me that my singing
instructors have mentioned that interrupting a vocalization is a definite
source of stress to the vocal cords; part of voice training consists of
learning to keep as even a flow as possible.  I suspect that speaking
isolated words with distinct pauses between them is a very unnatural kind of
voice activity and that we have not heard the last of this problem.

Our local paper 'the Nottingham Recorder' has the following item about
portable phones:
<P>
Mobile phones have been banned from hospitals throughout Britain following a
police probe into more than 100 deaths in an intensive care unit at
Worksop's Bassettlaw General Hospital.
<P>
A Department of Health circular has been sent to every hospital in the
country warning 'The department has received reports of mobile and cellular
telephones interfering with the operation of medical devices Portable,
cordless and cellular telephones should not be used close to patient
monitoring,infusion or life support equipment because interference may
affect their normal operation with potentially serious patient
consequences.......
<P>
Patients, contractors and other visitors should be discouraged from using
such telephones in hospitals.'
<P>
The risks seem to be obvious. I also wonder that apparently hospital staff
are to be banned from using these whereas everyone else is only to be 
`discouraged'!

There has been some publicity recently here in the UK about an attempted
fraud against the "Instant Win" version of our National Lottery. Whilst the
current alleged fraud is very crude and was unlikely to not get spotted it
does appear to show are rather classic case of a computerised security
checking system designed for *verification* which can be used to *obtain*
information as well as simply verifying it.
<P>
The "Instant Win" lottery makes use of scratch cards, purchased from retail
outlets, which when the foil covering is scratched off reveal whether the
card is a winner and if so for how much.
<P>
For smaller amounts the winners can collect their winnings immediately
from the retailer. (Larger amounts have to be claimed from the lottery
company directly).
<P>
In order to prevent fraud, as well as the winning amount the card also
has on it (again concealed under the foil) a security code number which
can be used to verify a winning card is genuine.
<P>
This is done by the retailer entering the security number into a
computerised terminal supplied by the lottery company which apparently not
only displays if the ticket is a winner but also the amount of the win.
<P>
The current alleged scam is said to work by the retailer just scratching off
the foil above the security number and then using his terminal to see if the
card was a big winner. If not he attempted to sell it to an unsuspecting
punter and hope they didn't spot the small bit already scraped off!
<P>
Now obviously the current scam is rather crude and not very likely to
succeed as it only requires one suspicious punter to tip off the lottery
company.
<P>
But it does appear to demonstrate what would seem to be a classic flaw in a
security system designed just for verification in that rather than requiring
input of both the code number and the winning amount and then simply giving
a Good/Bad response it actually gives out information in response to only
one input!
<P>
Whether there are actually any practical ways of exploiting this flaw, it
does seem surprising that a lottery system , surely something giving a high
priority to effective security should have an obvious flaw like this.
<P>
After all it is a close parallel to the classic flaw in a computer login
system that would tell you that a username was invalid before asking for a
password, hence allowing a hacker to identify valid usernames.  Surely
no-one would dream of implementing such a vulnerable system these days...

  The federal bureaucracy's computers are about to be dragged kicking and
  screaming into the 21st century.
<P>
  It seems the original computer program designers, many of whom are now
  dead or retired, never gave much thought to allowing government software
  to read dates beyond December 31, 1999.  Computers could mistakenly think,
  for example, that a date entered as "4/15/00" meant April 15, 1900, not
  the year 2000.  Massive accounting errors could therefore become the norm,
  such as calculating benefit checks based on 100 years of interest instead
  of just one year.  Data Dimensions, a computer consulting firm, estimates
  that "millennium conversion" could cost the federal government $75 Billion
  in equipment and labor to implement.  A typical federal agency will need
  to modify up to 100 "applications" (computer programs that use dates), at
  a labor expenditure of up to 60,000 people-days.
<P>
  So far, the Social Security Administration (SSA) is the only agency to
  begin the task of "millennium conversion," which is expected to take SSA
  seven years.  Do you want out of the government's costly time-warp?

At least in the case of document retrieval, full-text indexing with stop 
words, word stemming, a semi-automatically generated thesaurus, relevance 
scoring, and relevance feedback have been shown to outperform the best 
manually indexed documents in retrieval accuracy and completeness.  This 
result goes back to Gerard Salton's 1971 paper, "A New Comparison Between 
Conventional Indexing (MEDLARS) and Automatic Text Processing (SMART)" 
(CORNELLCS:TR71-115, available at

have the disk space for full-text indexes, you are at the mercy of the 
indexers (whether human or computer)...

Oh, yes, I certainly agree that the astronomers and ephemeris/almanac folks
like 1/1/01 as the century start.  However, because there was no year ZERO,
that does not scale backwards.  The first century BC clearly began on
1/1/-100, and the first millennium BC on 1/1/-1000.  The only SANE way to
handle this is to provide a 99-year first century; just as we have
leap-years and leap-seconds, we could have a backwards leap-century.
Indeed, it is just as well there were no computers in virtual-year 0000, or
the religious wars would have been proven recursively unsolvable.  <ADDRESS>PGN

&gt; We chose "second of century", using a double precision floating point<BR>
&gt; representation.  Analysis showed that this would preserve millisecond<BR>
&gt; accuracy for the span of interest.
<P>
Sigh.  There is more to time calculations than just understanding time, and
there is more to numerical analysis than just the range of the mantissa.
<P>
I'll try this once more, keeping it brief.  This project wouldn't have used
IEEE format 20 years ago, but let's proceed with the analysis under modern
assumptions.  The IEEE double-precision floating-point representation
provides 53 bits of significance in the mantissa.  Using the approximation
that 2^10 = 10^3, this can be see to allow a range of about 8x10^15 in the
mantissa, before bits start getting dropped.  Since there are about 3x10^7
seconds in a year, or about 10^8 every 3 years, one can represent about
8x16x3 = 384 years to millisecond precision without violating that range,
right?
<P>
Wrong.  This is true only if you represent time as integer milliseconds.
Since the representation used seconds, the milliseconds were represented
fractionally.  There are only four millisecond values that can be
represented accurately in a binary floating-point system: 0, 250, 500, and
750.  ANYTHING ELSE is an approximation.  This is especially true if your
calculations involve any addition and subtraction of times.
<P>
&gt; Since we usually were satisfied with one minute accuracy this<BR>
&gt; seemed sufficient.
<P>
It sounds like this project involved some sort of modeling of the physical
world.  In such cases, the loss of a few bits of accuracy may not matter,
although I still think programmers ought to understand numerical analysis
better than most do.  But remember that the original discussion of time
representation arose in the context of measuring time in computer and
financial applications, where these bits can matter.
<P>
&gt; There are a few applications that need better than millisecond precision, <BR>
&gt; but for most of the worlds applications double precision floating point <BR>
&gt; will provide enough precision for the next few millennia.  (A simple test <BR>
&gt; for those who are unsure about their needs.  Do you compensate for the <BR>
&gt; variations in the rate of the Earth's rotation?  If not, you probably don't<BR> 
&gt; need millisecond accuracy.)
<P>
This is both a broad and a biased statement.  Here's a simple response to
the simple test: I'm not dealing with astronomical phenomena, and so I
couldn't care less about variations in the Earth's rotation.  What I care
about is whether I can query the system time, do something, query the time
again, and subtract to get an accurate elapsed time.  I care about not only
milliseconds, but microseconds (and in a few years, nanoseconds).
<P>
Now it's true that I generally deal with time in a small range.
Unfortunately, the system time is represented in terms of a relatively long
base interval.  So I have to be able to take two times measured in years,
subtract them, and get microsecond precision in my results.  If the times
are represented as integer microseconds, I can be sure that everything will
"balance," as the accountants say.  If a sloppy floating-point
representation insists on giving it to me as integer and fractional seconds,
things won't add up, and my papers may not get published.
<P>
&gt; There could have been some round-off issues, but we <BR>
&gt; rarely did any arithmetic other than addition or subtraction of two <BR>
&gt; times, where millisecond accuracy is maintained.
<P>
But addition and subtraction are precisely the places where numerical errors
are introduced!  Millisecond accuracy was *not* maintained in this
situation.  Since you only cared about minutes, this hardly mattered, but
it's still an incorrect statement.
<P>
&gt; A word of caution, double precision floating point is suitable for an <BR>
&gt; internal representation of UTC, or "absolute" time.
<P>
It's only appropriate when you're doing modeling of the physical world,
where you don't care about losing a few bits of accuracy in the fraction
because your measurements aren't that good anyway.  Double precision is a
*terrible* way to model elapsed time inside a computer system.  It has
nothing to do with the nature of time, and everything to do with numerical
analysis.

Of course, we have here the canonical example of PR people (in this case the
"Resource Persons" who provided this information) who really don't
understand what they are saying when talking about computers.
<P>
What company, for example, is "Windows 95", and what products does it
develop ?
<P>
Add to that the fact that products developed by Clark Development (makers of
PC Board) and Mustang Software (makers of Wildcat) are *legitimately*
distributable on a try-before-you-buy basis as shareware, and you have the
canonical nightmare of BBS operators being forced to prove to the computer
illiterate judicial process that they were perfectly entitled to make copies
of such files available for download.
<P>
In my experience of BBSing, I also have to suspect that some of the
"products" developed by Borland, Microsoft, IBM, Novell, et al., may well
have been freely distributable service fixes.  All of these companies have
been known to make such patches widely available for the benefit of their
customers.  Take one service pack, accidentally label it with the name of
the product that it is a patch to, and there's an immediate source of
confusion even to people who know what they are doing ...
<P>
On a more light-hearted note :
<P>
Why should access to information on how to successfully commit suicide be
made unavailable to software pirates ?  Surely those interested in stamping
out piracy would applaud such a move ?
<P>
Also, who would trust instructions on how to "succeed" at suicide to be
reliable, when it is patently obvious that the author obviously lived long 
enough afterwards to write up said instructions ... ?

Have no fear, other research groups are working on this problem! The Library
2000 group at the MIT Lab for Computer Science is part of a 5 university
project working on digital libraries. One of our highest priorities is
replication. Data stored in a digital library system will be replicated; not
only locally, but in a geographically diverse way to protect against a
wide-area disaster. The replication scheme itself is transparent. If a site
goes down, other sites replace it automatically.
<P>
In addition, we are working on long term storage. This means persistent
storage as well as moving data to the current media continually (as
opposed to leaving it on a PDP-10 DECtape). However, the only media which
has persistence of 50+ years which has been proven in a reliable way is
film. So a possibility is to microfilm the bit patterns of digital
documents as an archive mechanism. For more information on our project and
some interesting papers on fault-tolerance and replication, please refer
to our WWW site: &lt;URL:<A HREF="http://ltt-www.lcs.mit.edu/ltt-www&gt;">http://ltt-www.lcs.mit.edu/ltt-www&gt;</A>.

&gt; ...  It is impossible to get out of the system.  ...
<P>
My university installed recently a library system with a similar feature.
Here, you need a password... to log out of the system!
<P>
The password, of course, is included in the documentation handed out to
users, but it is easy for casual users to be trapped by the system.

&gt;Subject: Computer-controlled electrocution (<A HREF="/Risks/17.06.html">RISKS-17.06</A>)
<P>
&gt;People seem upset by the use of a computer to control an electric chair...
<P>
Some don't care. But in this age of "software reuse" and modular hardware &amp;
software components, there is a real risk here. It's the risk of having
one's work put to uses of which you are ashamed, or would be if you knew
about it. This risk exists in the development of any modular type of
component - you don't know what the next user is going to hook it up to (a
bomb, a power grid, or an incubator).  There are ways to mitigate this risk,
such as working on components so specialized that such use would be
infeasible, but this only goes so far. A certain engineer I know of tells me
of the irony of being caught by a radar speed trap after having invented a
key component of the radar guns being used - it's not always the "bad guys"
that make unanticipated use of the technology, and it's not always the "good
guys" that invent the item being used in an unanticipated context. So there
are lots of opportunities to "suffer" in this way.
<P>
More to the "RISKS" point, though, the components any given engineer or
inventor designs may well be coopted for other uses to which they &gt;seem&lt;
suited, but actually are not - trying to adapt "fail-safe" control
technologies to become "fail-deadly" (when "deadly" is the intent of the
novel component context) brings up an entirely new face of the
re-engineering complexity debate. Particularly when, as in this case, the
lethality of the resulting system is intended to be highly directed, but
there are people (other than the intended victim) involved in the use of the
equipment. It would be hard to feel good about a fail-safe one designed into
one's component if the result was that the executioner fries instead of the
convict...
<P>
The previous post also tried to point out that eliminating capital
punishment (which would make such machinery a moot issue) is a debate not
germain to RISKS. While I tend to agree with this in specific, I wanted to
point out that (political/social/other) systems can be designed in ways
which encourage or discourage the implementation of RISKy support
structures, but this notion is rarely considered in guiding the development
of social policy. Another RISK of ignoring RISKS?

Miami's Metromover was running again Wednesday afternoon after the downtown
inner loop was closed for more than two days because of "phantom" trains on
the track.  Trains began rolling again on the 1.9 mile inner loop at 12:19
p.m. The rest of the 4.4-mile system - an outer loop and extensions north to
the Omni International Mall and south to Brickell - was not affected.
<P>
Metro-Dade Transit Agency technicians attributed the problem to a faulty
transmitter in a computer. Manny Palmeiro, a MDTA marketing manager, said
the system detected trains when none were on the tracks.
<P>
"Phantom" trains have been a recurring Metromover glitch, one of a long
string of computer and other electronic and electric problems plaguing the
system. MDTA disclosed last week that in the spring and fall, sunshine
sometimes trips safety sensors that detect the presence of trains. Those
sensors are being realigned to shield them from the sun.
<P>
Last month, MDTA managers warned that Metromover glitches likely will not go
away soon. In fact, they said glitches may well be a permanent fixture of
the nation's largest and most elaborate downtown automated rail system.

At page 91 of the April 1995 Law and Order magazine (v.43 no.4) in the
"Police Equipment News" section a short item describes a "Collision
avoidance system" which "takes advantage of the millions of radar detectors
in civilian use."  Basically, the system requires police cruisers and other
emergency vehicles (e.g., ambulance) to be equipped with microwave
transmitters designed to set off speed-radar detectors.  Drivers will
presumably react to radar-detector alerts by looking around, improving the
chance that they will see and yield to or avoid a vehicle using lights &amp;|
siren to claim right-of-way.  The detector vendor Cobra Electronics
developed the system and sells detectors capable of decoding short text
messages from the alerting signal.  Cobra's present CAS transmitters can be
programmed to send either "Emergency Vehicle" (moving vehicle) or "Road
Hazard" (vehicle stopped on highway) and the scheme allows for other
messages.
<P>
I'm not sure how to score the risks here.  I admire the elegance of
regarding existing radar detectors as general-purpose warning receivers, and
the message encoding is icing on the cake.  (I applaud the designers for
using an open and flexible alphameric code to permit arbitrary message
content.)  On the other hand, the transmitters will ``pollute the channel''
(degrade S/N ratio) in a sense, making it harder for drivers to detect
``real'' radar threats.  So long as police confine system use to emergencies
I think it's great.  If the system gains wide use, auto makers could put
alert-receivers into vehicles at the factory (such receivers need not serve
as general radar-detectors; they could discriminate warning signals by their
alphameric code content).
<P>
An article in the same magazine at page 77 by Tom Yates titled "Magic Patrol
Cars: Police Travel Information Superhighway" suggests in glowing terms the
many benefits to be had from increasing the computerization of patrol cars.
I think the author reveals a certain naivete.  For example he writes of one
in-car machine: "the system is easy to learn because the software operates
under the computer industry standard MS-DOS/Windows operating systems.  To
make the system even faster dedicated function keys minimize the number of
keystrokes required for a given operation such as calling up information,
editing data, or initiating system functions."  He's describing a system to
be used while the patrol car is moving.  Considering how the car may lurch
around I wonder if users will get in trouble by sometimes striking the wrong
function key?  Later in his column Mr. Yates (who, I should point out, is a
good writer and clearly an expert on police vehicles and operations--if
still on middle of the computer learning curve) discusses engine computers
and suggests that they will be improved to offer very sophisticated
variations in performance for different (e.g., cruising, pursuing)
situations.  I'm sure many RISKS readers would wait, as I would, for the
second or third software release...

[Reproduced in RISKS with the author's permission]
<P>
It's 10:00 P.M. on a weekend night, and some obnoxious guy in the
America Online Chat Forum won't shut up.  What do you do?
<P>
You give them the finger, of course.  And if that doesn't work, you
can always shoot them.
<P>
Want everybody in the chat room to shut up so you can talk?  Just
click the button labeled "Ghost," and the screen will clear away
everyone else's comments, giving you space to make yourself heard.
<P>
You won't find these features on America Online's standard set of menu
options.  But they are part of a new anti-AOL program called AOHell
that's making the rounds on some electronic bulletin board systems.
<P>
AOHell can do more than make mischief in America Online's chat rooms:
the program has a number of devilish features that seem designed for
turning online lives into living nightmares.
<P>
Armed with AOHell, one user can send dozens, or hundreds, of electronic mail
messages to an unwitting victim in just a few seconds, a technique known as
"mail bombing."  AOHell can also mail bomb the victim's fax machine and even
his US mailbox.  And what if you really don't like another subscriber?  Just
click on the "Punt" command and you'll abruptly log them off, thanks to an
apparent bug in America Online's operating software.
<P>
Why would someone develop such a program and give it away for free over the
Internet?
<P>
"I hate the staff on AOL for one, I hate most of the people on AOL for
another, and I wanted to cause a lot of chaos," explains one of the
anonymous authors of AOHell, who identifies himself only as Da Chronic, in
the program's instruction manual.
<P>
Indeed, AOHell's worst punches seem to be aimed directly at America Online
itself.
<P>
AOHell has a nefarious system built into it for generating fictitious
credit-card numbers.  According to users, the program can make free accounts
that last up to 10 hours of online time or one week, whichever comes first.
For users with high bills for the nation's second-largest online service,
AOHell has the ability to let users download files for free.
<P>
"Any member using AOHell will have their account immediately terminated,"
says Margaret Ryan, a spokesperson for the company.
<P>
AOHell is a piece of software for engaging in illegal activities, sometimes
called banditware, which runs in conjunction with America Online's
communications software for Windows-based computers. It appears to be the
first time that such a program has been written to directly attack one of
the nation's large online services.
<P>
Some of the AOHell's abilities appear to exploit bugs in the America Online
system, while others, such as the ability to display a raised middle finger
in a chat room, seem to merely simulate an extremely rapid typist. Ryan
wouldn't say if AOL has any technical fixes in the works that would prevent
the program from functioning properly.
<P>
Indeed, Ryan doesn't even know who wrote AOHell.
<P>
Although AOHell's author has chosen to remain anonymous, a built-in feature
allows AOHell users to send bug reports to the program's author.  Those
reports get sent to a computer in Finland called an anonymous remailer,
which allows people on the Internet to exchange electronic mail without
knowing each other's identities.
<P>
"If you think AOH 2.0 is marvelous, wait until you see 3.0," wrote the
program's author, in response to an electronic mail message. "I'm almost
finished with it and it will make version 2 look like a Commodore 64
program, to say the least."

In the aftermath of the recent tragedy in Oklahoma, there have been several
reports of government agencies allowing at least temporary telecommuting
arrangements for their employees.
<P>
One wonders if widespread telecommuting could alleviate this kind of 
problem completely.  
<P>
Individual attacks and attempts to disrupt the communications backbone are a 
possibility, but I'm not sure there's much to attract terrorists in either of 
them.  Harrassing individuals hasn't done much for the so-called "Unabomber", 
and disruption of telephone service is more an annoyance than something to 
live in terror of.
<P>
In any case, I like the sound of "everyone go home and work" a lot better
than "we'll be installing video cameras on every street corner".

Not that this should be unexpected news to any of you, but Cyber Winter is
at hand.
<P>
We are aware of the Cyber Glaciers -- in the form of the S.390 Censorship
Bill and the S.1984 FBI Police-State Enablement Act -- blasted loose from
the Washington Ice Floes by the ever-so-timely Oklahoma explosion.  But
merely the _news_ of the glaciers is enough to chill hearts and will...
<P>
One list, with mild political content, was shut down last week with no
explanation.  After persistent investigation, I was able to learn that
someone up the byte-chain feared that the list _might_ be perceived as
controversial _by someone someday_, and out of concern for his "job and
family", felt he better shut down the list ASAP.  I learned this from the
person himself, although it took several rounds of questions to get past his
layers of embarrassment.
<P>
This was at a prestigious university.  I promised not to name names.
<P>
The Internet is very fragile.  It doesn't require police activity to shut
it down; all it takes is the fear of controversy, in a climate of
media-fanned public emotions.
<P>
The lists and servers operated by universities and corporations are brittle
as fine crystal -- those institutions have no incentive to risk even the
_potential_ censure of their customers, alumni, directors, funding sources,
etc.
<P>
Commercial providers (AOL, CServe, etc) similarly won't wait for a knock on
the door before they "clean up their act" -- and I mean sparkling
lemon-fresh baby-powder clean, suitable for children, grannies, and
Baptists (no offense intended.).
<P>
We are entering what the ACLU refers to as a "chilling" era.  The Well,
CPSR, APC -- and other sites with a conscience -- will in many cases take a
principled, courageous stand for cyber rights.  But those are exactly the
sites that the Police State legislation is designed to suppress.  They
can't afford to pursue the "Enumerated Defenses", the way Cyberspace INC
will be able to, when it distributes its interactive soft-porn cyber-soaps
into everyone's home, in order to sell burgers, lager, and designer jeans.
Forget open BBS's -- they'll soon be history.
<P>
It's time to get out your winter coats.  For what little difference it'll
make, you might want to take down the personal email and snail addresses of
your online associates while you still can.

&gt;described in the manual and (2) how it actually works is proprietary<BR>
&gt;information.  [LG: (1) is dangerous by itself, and if (2) is true, then why<BR>
&gt;pretending to describe the procedure in the first place.]
<P>
It's all true.
<P>
The authentication protocol used by Lotus Notes is a somewhat involved mix
of public key and secret key cryptography designed for good security and
performance. In the Security Internals online book in a section on the
certificate hierarchy and the implied trust model, there is an aside on how
authentication takes place once the two sides know each others public keys.
Because the truth was complex and the complexity seemed irrelevant, the
author substituted a "classic" public key authentication protocol for the
real one.  Unfortunately, while that protocol was not itself flawed, using
the same public key for that protocol and for the encryption and the signing
of electronic mail would be insecure. That was the central point of the
Dwork article: that two well designed cryptographic protocols can be
insecure when used together sharing keys.  The actual Lotus Notes
authentication protocol does not have this problem.
<P>
While the Lotus Notes authentication protocol was never intended to be
proprietary or secret, it was also never fully publicly documented, and the
public documentation that did exist was incorrect. A more complete writeup
has subsequently appeared in the book "Network Security: Private
Communication in a Public World", by Charlie Kaufman, Radia Perlman, and
Mike Speciner, Prentice Hall, 1995. The on-line documentation will be
corrected.

&gt; ... Since there are about 3x10^7seconds in a year, or about 10^8 every <BR>
&gt; 3 years, one can represent about 8x16x3 = 384 years to millisecond <BR>
&gt; precision without violating that range, right?
<P>
Wrong.  This confuses milliseconds and microseconds; You can represent 285
years to *microsecond* accuracy in 53 bits.  If you only care about
millisecond accuracy, you can represent about 285,000 years.  There are also
ways of using the sign bit to double the effective range.

&gt; [...]  However, the only media which has persistence of 50+ years which <BR>
&gt; has been proven in a reliable way is film.
<P>
This points out a risk of being to close to the technology.  Perhaps the
microfilm is the only "technological" way of storing media for 50+ years,
but it seems to me that the low-tech method of printed books has about 5 to
10 times that lifespan, depending on the paper and ink used.  It also has
the benefit of being immediately accessible to the reader, as no fancy
technology is necessary to extract the data, outside of a current
prescription for one's glasses.

And what about paper (acid-free), papyrus, or other similar media that 
have lasted hundreds or thousands of years intact?  Or stone (e.g., 
cuneiforms or etchings on silicon)?  
<P>
Microfilm (silver on film) has been around far less time than these.  In
fact, the film media used in the 1930s (nitrocellulose) has proven to be
disastrous -- it practically self-destructs.  Moreover, silver has only been
in use for a bit over a century as a means of fixing an image, and it has
distinct disadvantages, due to oxidation.  Carbon-based ink on non-acid
paper, on the other hand, lasts virtually forever.  Perhaps replacing paper
with Mylar would be a good step, but silver halide images would not appear
to be good for long-term archiving; photographers have turned to platinum
and other means of giving longevity to photographic images, in lieu of
silver.  India ink on papyrus or vellum might last longer, though.  Maybe
convert the data to carbon-based laser toner on Mylar in barcodes?

<H4>Overview</H4>
<P>
Over the past decade, fundamental changes have taken place in the nature and
the environment of surveillance. New information systems offer an
unprecedented ability to identify, monitor and track a virtually limitless
number of individuals. Some leading-edge technologies are likely to
revolutionize the practice of surveillance. The factors of cost, scale,
size, location and distance have, in many instances, become largely
irrelevant.
<P>
The impact of political and economic change throughout the world has also
created unforeseen dimensions to surveillance. The evolution of a Global
Information Infrastructure will have a profound impact on the scope of
potential surveillance of individuals. The end of the cold war and the
privatization of public sector activities has magnified the impact of
change. The merging of technologies has also created new opportunities for
wide-scale surveillance.
<P>
The nature of surveillance has changed to the extent that modern information
systems involve a pre-requisite of general surveillance of populations. The
pursuit of perfect identity has created a rush to develop systems which
create an intimacy between people and technology.  Advanced biometric
identification and sophisticated ID card systems combine with geographic
tracking to create the potential to pinpoint the location of any individual.
The use of distributed databases and data matching programs makes such
tracking economically feasible on a large scale.
<P>
Extraordinary advances have recently been made in the field of visual
surveillance. Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) systems can digitally scan,
record, reconfigure and identify human faces, even in very poor light
conditions. Remote sensing through advanced satellite systems can combine
with ground databases and geodemographic systems to create mass surveillance
of human activity.
<P>
The globalization of information systems will take information once and for
all away from the protection and jurisdiction of national boundaries. The
development of data havens and rogue data states is allowing highly
sensitive personal information to be processed outside any legal protection.
<P>
At a more intimate level, research is underway in more than a dozen
countries with the aim of implanting microchip technology directly into the
human brain. US and European medical institutes have already conducted many
such operations. The creation of a direct link between the human brain and
computer technology is at an advanced stage. Such procedures are initially
aimed at stimulating dead senses and paralyzed limbs. Within two decades, it
is possible that such implants will be at a sufficiently advanced stage to
enable complex interaction between the brain and external technology.
<P>
The science of nanotechnology, which involves the re-configuration of
individual atoms and molecules, will present the potential for virtually
undetectable covert surveillance.
<P>
These and other developments are changing the nature and meaning of
surveillance. Law has scarcely had time to address even the most visible of
these changes. Public policy lags behind the technology by many years. The
repercussions for privacy and for numerous other aspects of law and human
rights need to be considered sooner rather than later.
<P>
This one day conference will present an overview of these leading-edge
technologies, and will assess the impact that they may have in the immediate
future. Experts and analysts will discuss the nature and application of the
new technologies, and the public policy that should be developed to cope
with their use.
<P>
The conference theme is unique, and interest in the event has
already been expressed from throughout the world.
<H4>
Program contents
</H4>
The first session will assess new dimensions in current surveillance
technologies. The remainder of the day will be devoted to exploring
technologies which are in the formative stage of development.

The two top executives of a Helsinki engineering company have been given
60-day jail sentences and $72,000 fines for knowingly using illegal copies
of AutoCAD computer-aided design software.  The stiff punishment is a

companies suffered $15.2 billion in global losses last year due to software
piracy.  (Financial Times 4/28/95 p.3) [Edupage, 30 April 1995]

The Wireless Technology Group says studies show that in some cases cellular
phones placed near the chest can cause pacemakers to recalibrate themselves
or stop and restart.  The advisory group warns that new digital pocket
phones are of particular concern -- especially since their numbers are
likely to proliferate once personal communications services are widespread.
No such effects from the older analog cellular phones have been observed.  A
spokesman for Medtronic, a pacemaker supplier, says the company is advising
patients with pacemakers to turn off their portable phones when the phone is

The Road Watches You: 'Smart' highway systems may know too much<BR>
&copy; 1995, Simson L. Garfinkel
<P>
Highway authorities throughout the country are building futuristic "smart
road" systems designed to unclog our highways and bridges, improve driver
safety, and create a variety of new services for our nation's motorists.
But these smart roads could lead to an Orwellian surveillance state if we
do not act now to change their course.
<P>
One smart road system is already in operation on New York's Tappan Zee
Bridge. Called E-ZPass, the system allows drivers to drive through the toll
plaza without reaching for their wallets or rolling down their windows.
Instead, a computer operated by the Thruway Authority reads an electronic
tag mounted inside the car's windshield, and automatically deducts the toll
from a special pre-established account.
<P>
Other systems are going up around the country. In Florida, the
Orlando-Orange County Expressway Authority has a system called E-PASS which
lets drivers pay their tolls on the East-West Expressway and certain parts
of the Central Florida GreeneWay. Instead of a windshield tag, E-PASS uses
a radio transponder the size of a flashlight mounted under the car's front
bumper. A similar system is being planned for the San Francisco Bay Area.
<P>
These automatic toll collection systems are just the beginning of a
nationwide plan called Intelligent Transportation Systems, or ITS. Rather
than have each city adopt its own tag or transponder, the Department of
Transportation and ITS America, a Washington-based organization that
promotes the system, are scrambling to create a single, national standard.
<P>
As envisioned, smart roads could further reduce highway congestion by
alerting drivers to upcoming accidents; a computer display mounted on the
dashboard could suggest alternative routes. With its planned two-way
communication between the car and the intelligent road, ITS could even
eliminate the search of a place to park. Instead, your car's computer could
automatically locate the nearest lot with an opening and electronically
reserve you a place.
<P>
But there is a dark side to this plan, a privacy problem that its boosters
are trying to pave under. These systems offer unprecedented opportunities
to monitor the movements of drivers. It would create a bank of personal
information that government and private industry might have difficulty
resisting.
<P>
Consider Florida's E-PASS system. Each month, every E-PASS subscriber gets
a detailed statement listing the exact time, date and location that each
toll was collected.  ITS America has adopted a set of privacy principles
which say that states shouldn't take advantage of this dat, yet the
organization  specifically envisions that "states may legislate conditions
under which ITS information will be made available."
<P>
Phil Agre, who teaches communications at the University of California, San
Diego, and closely follows privacy issues, warns that there might be other
unintended consequences of the widespread use of ITS systems.  Auto
insurance companies already offer discounts to driver who don't live in
areas of high auto theft or accidents; in the future, says Agree, they
might offer discounts to drivers who can prove that they haven't driven
onto "the wrong side of the tracks."
<P>
The data could also be sold illegally by insiders. Information about a
person's movements might be a key fact in forcing an out-of-court
settlement in a divorce or worker's compensation case. Private
investigators would have a big incentive to bribe low-paid clerical workers
for a photocopy of somebody's toll-crossing bill.
<P>
There is an alternative to this system. Instead of transmitting an account
number, a radio would transmit "digital cash" using a smart card inside the
car  similar to the telephone cards used in many European countries. But
judging by plans under way so far, state agencies and the Government
haven't shown much interest in making privacy a priority in the design of
the tomorrow's intelligent highways.
<P>
Americans have always loved the freedom that their cars give them. Could
that too become a thing of the past?

We had a car stolen from our company's parking garage recently. The car had
a car alarm which appears to have aided the car thief.
<P>
The thief wandered around our building (a separate risk) until he found an
a set of keys in an empty cubicle. The cubicle occupant had left the cube
for a few moments. The thief the keys and then wandered down to our five
level parking garage.
<P>
We presume he walked down the spiral pressing the button on the car alarm
transmitter on the key chain. When he came into range of the car it
chirped, giving away its location and he deactivated the alarm. He then
stole the car.
<P>
Personally I hate audible car alarms and prefer to mechanically immobilise
a car. Another argument in my favor!

Interesting! I didn't figure it was original nor did I talk about how to
combat the problem which amount separating the alarm controller from the
keychain with the attendant risk of them becoming separated or lost or have
a silent alarm (indicate alarm state by a flashing LED rather than beeping
or flashing the headlamps). The latter is probably a better solution. The
best solution is to immobilise the car mechanically.

A new book ("Silicon Snake Oil") by Clifford Stoll, the scientist and
computer security expert who once tracked down an international spy ring
using the Internet, documents his disdain for most of what goes on in
cyberspace.  "The information highway is being sold to us as delivering
information, but what it's really delivering is data... Unlike data,
information has utility, timeliness, accuracy, a pedigree."  He says that
what's missing in cyberspace is "anyone who will say, hey, this is no
good...  Editors serve as barometers of quality, and most of an editor's
time is spent saying no."  (New York Times 4/30/95 E7) [Edupage, 30 April 1995]

  Thank you for your enquiry concerning the Nottingham Recorder.
  There is no truth in the newspaper's allegation regarding an
  incident at the Bassetlaw General Hospital.

Mr J Lefever also confirmed that the Safety Action Bulletin, which I have
posted here in the past, is the most recent advice on the subject of mobile
phones in hospitals.
<P>
So, as far as I understand, there are anecdotal stories of mobile phones
interfering with medical equipment, but these incidents have not been fatal.
The current advice is that the use of mobile phones, two-way radios etc.
should be discouraged in the vicinity of sensitive monitoring equipment.

It seems clear to me that much of the anti-free-internet propaganda comes
from journalists, politicians, etc who are technologically illiterate - one
only has to analyse what they say to see that.  Clearly such people don't
surf the internet, so someone is feeding them with stories, knowing full
well what reaction to expect. That could be someone with an interest in
converting the internet into a controlled and / or profitable enterprise.
There are similar attacks here on the BBC and no doubt in the USA on the PBS
from similar quarters.

The date/time functions of Sybase won't accept dates before 1753 because

earlier dates.  Well, this guy was in charge of alumni records at an

It seems to me that the real issue as to whether or not floating point
representations are appropriate for timestamps is not "can I get microsecond
resolution?" but "is it going to work unconditionally?"
<P>
Floating point numbers bedevil numerical programmers for several reasons; we
need to know the radix, number of mantissa and exponent digits, behaviour of
rounding, etc. to guarantee "good" results---there is a reason that
textbooks have been written about numerical analysis. Modern computers
generally stick to the IEEE-754 standard for floating point arithmetic, and
thus code is usually fairly interchangeable, but anyone who has ever done
intensive number crunching on old IBMs, VAXen, or CRAYs can tell horror
stories about interchanging floating point programs between systems. Even
going between a SPARCstation and my '486 at home, I can see a few digits
change. "Unconditional portability" is ludicrous under these conditions.
<P>
A 64 bit integer can represent 1.84e19 values, which implies about 2
nanosecond resolution of a thousand year interval. Integer math is very
portable across computer systems, or at least is very easy to describe
fully, and 1 + 1 always evaluates as 2, and not 2.0001.

In my original note I mentioned something really simple: handling clock
ticks.  Not handling time, which is a topic for PhD theses (Stanford is
about to grant a PhD for a thesis on temporal representation in databases).
<P>
My problem was simple: I needed to do 48-bit arithmetic on a machine which
had 32-bit integers.  I had been given an assembler routine which did the
48-bit arithmetic wrong; and I was fortunate to test it in December when its
accumulated error was about 3 minutes in converting clock ticks to a date
(in January, it had almost no error).
<P>
So, what to do?  Obviously, writing 48-bit arithmetic in assembler was
error-prone and tedious.  Doing it in PL/I (this was before C was generally
available) wasn't much more fun nor less error-prone (anyone who has read
the PL/I manual's description of handling overflow and precisions will agree
that it's not a pretty sight; and I later learned that the PL/I implementors
had got it wrong anyway).  And I didn't have access to LISP's
rational-number packages.
<P>
In a flash of inspiration, I realized that double-precision floating
point, with 53-bit mantissas, would handle my 48-bit integers with no
round-off errors.  Converting between 48-bit integers and floating
point is simple (it's a "well-known assembler idiom" that takes about
3 instructions).  And everything would then proceed perfectly (even a
Pentium can get floating-point addition and subtraction right).
<P>
At one stroke I had removed a few pages of difficult assembler and
replaced them by a few lines of PL/I.  Less code, less chance of error.
<P>
[Inspired by this, I wrote a disk accounting package that eschewed
packed decimal arithmetic and instead used floating point (of
course, I calculated everything in cents because 1.01 doesn't
represent exactly but 101 does.  Another success.)]
<P>
One of my jobs as a programmer is to reduce the risk of error in my system.
I can only test so much.  Testing 48-bit integer arithmetic is not fun, at
least for me; and proving the code right is difficult (Knuth allegedly wrote
"Beware of bugs in the above code; I have only proved it correct, not tried
it.").  PL/I's implementation of 15-digit packed decimal was buggy.  And I
wasn't being paid by the number of lines of code (au contraire: if I
finished early, I took time off).
<P>
The lessons for RISKS: before you try to do something complicated, maybe
there's something simple and reliable lying around that you can pervert
slightly into the form you want.  [My original RISKS lesson was to be sure
to test time/date conversion routines at many times of the year; if they
work in January, they might not work in December.]

Agreed - the debate has been interesting, but hasn't it run it's course yet?  
<P>
The fact is that every programmer needs to decide whether to use floating,
decimal, integer, string, etc and the appropriate precision for every
variable in every program depending on the application.  If they don't know
the appropriate form for time for the problem in hand, then they aren't
programmers!

&gt;... microwave transmitters designed to set off speed-radar detectors.
<P>
It's interesting to note a recent thread in rec.radio.scanner, where a
number of posters recounted with glee their use of low-power microwave
emitters to trigger radar detectors. The uniform response by drivers was to
hit the brakes. Equipping an ambulance with such a device should ensure that
the first vehicle on the scene of a rear-end collision will be equipped for
the emergency.

At page 91 of the April 1995 Law and Order magazine (v.43 no.4) in the
"Police Equipment News" section a short item describes a "Collision
avoidance system" that "takes advantage of the millions of radar detectors
in civilian use."  Basically, the system requires police cruisers and other
emergency vehicles (e.g., ambulance) to be equipped with microwave
transmitters designed to set off speed-radar detectors.  Drivers will
presumably react to radar-detector alerts by looking around, improving the
chance that they messages from the alerting signal.  Cobra's present CAS
transmitters can be programmed to send either "Emergency Vehicle" (moving
vehicle) or "Road Hazard" (vehicle stopped on highway) and the scheme allows
for other messages.

Having done some emergency medicine in ambulances, I cannot refrain from the
following reflection.  What does the average (slightly speeding) motorist do
when s(he) realizes that someone is aiming a radar beam at the car? Easy,
they will slam the brakes!  This is precisely what I would *not* want to
happen a few cars up front if I was trying to negotiate a tricky traffic
situation at high speed, instead, I'd like people give way in a controlled
manner.  /RS

&gt; ... Clifford Stoll ... says that what's missing in cyberspace is <BR>
&gt; "anyone who will say, hey, this is no good...  Editors serve as barometers
<P>
I would say the opposite is true. On Usenet you *can't* get away with
posting nonsense, because there are thousands of "editors" ready to jump on
your posting and gleefully shred it in public. With printed information,
you're depending on the editor being competent to judge the veracity of the
information presented. It's become routine, for me at least, to check on the
net to verify things I've read in print media.
<P>
Yes, you have to be a bit savvy, to find the groups where competant people
are monitoring postings, but that's true in print too. You have everything
from the electronic equivalents of the National Enquirer, to groups like,
well, comp.risks.
<P>
&gt; The date/time functions of Sybase won't accept dates before 1753 because...
<P>
What do they do about dates in pre-soviet Russia?
<P>
I had the same reaction to the general idea of using floating point numbers
for relative time. Even in integers you need to beware of the singularity
around zero (say you're dividing an integer by 2 to schedule events, if your
division truncates towards zero you'll miss one event because -1, 0, and +1
all end up at the same point), with floating point these singularities are
scattered up and down the number line. In any case the example seems to have
been more a case of using floating point operators to perform 48 bit integer
arithmetic, rather than using floating point arithmetic.

2000 journalists recently received a diskette containing marketing
information on Mercedes' new E-class cars. As hidden donation, this diskette
contained also a virus of the Stoned family (Stoned.NoInt alias Stoned III
alias Bloomington) which so far was not "in the wild" in Germany. After
having been alarmed, Mercedes shipped 2,000 diskettes of a reliable AV
product to the journalists.
<P>
Many media reported this accident in Germany, claiming that "this virus is
harmless". This is not fully untrue as the only intentional "damage" in this
stealth variant of the Stoned family results in failures only with
high-density diskettes. It is also possible that unintended damage occurs in
the directory structure. This virus attempts to hide the infected boot
sector against detection by some AV product. Fortunately, the product
choosen by Mercedes reliably detects Stoned.NoInt on diskettes and disks.
Question remains open whether the addressed journalists tested and cleaned
all diskettes and systems which had been in contact with the infected
diskette; otherwise, Mercedes marketing may have a long-time impact on some
Mercedes drivers' PC systems :-)

PC SOFTWARE FOILS WIRETAPS  5/10/95<BR>
By SIMSON L. GARFINKEL<BR>
Special to the Mercury News
<P>
As the U.S. Senate debates granting the Federal Bureau of Investigation new
powers to wiretap personal communications, three West Coast computer
programmers have planned their own preemptive strike: a free program,
distributed on the Internet, that renders legal and illegal wiretaps
useless.
<P>
The programmers, Bill Dorsey of Los Altos, Pat Mullarky of Bellevue, Wash.,
and Paul Rubin of Milpitas, plan to release today a program that turns
ordinary IBM-compatible personal computers into an untappable secure
telephone. It uses an encryption algorithm called "triple-DES" that is
widely believed to be unbreakable.
<P>
"Electronic surveillance by the government is on the rise," says Dorsey,
the group's lead programmer. "There also exists an equally large threat
from the private sector as well: industrial espionage. Foreign governments
are interested in wiretapping and getting information out of our high-tech
firms."
<P>
Called Nautilus, the program is being released as an attack on the Clinton
administration's national encryption standard, the Clipper chip. Civil
rights groups have criticized the Clipper initiative, since the federal
government holds a copy of every chip's master key and can use that key to
decrypt -- or decode -- any Clipper-encrypted conversation. But since the
keys used by Nautilus to encrypt conversations are created by users, the
government does not have a copy.
<P>
A nod to Jules Verne
<P>
Nautilus has another advantage over Clipper: Whereas AT&amp;T's
Clipper-equipped Telephone Security Devices Model 3600 costs $1,100,
Nautilus is free program.
<P>
"You don't need any special expensive hardware for it. You just use
ordinary PCs," says Rubin.
<P>
The name "Nautilus" was taken from Captain Nemo's submarine in the Jules
Verne novel, "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea." But whereas Nautilus the sub
was used to sink Clipper ships, the programmers hope that their creation
will sink Clipper chips.
<P>
To use Nautilus, both participants must have a copy of the program and an
IBM PC-compatible computer equipped with a Sound Blaster card and a
high-speed modem. The two participants must also agree upon a series of
words called a "pass phrase," which is used to encrypt the conversation.
Both participants run the program and type in the pass phrase; one person
instructs their computer to place the telephone call, the other instructs
their computer to answer.
<P>
Once the call is in progress, either user must press a key on their
computer in order to speak, similar to using a hand-held radio. But unlike
walkie-talkies, the users can interrupt each other.
<P>
Could help criminals
<P>
Such innovations could lead to conversations that would be practically
foolproof from eavesdropping, either by pranksters or the government. It
could become invaluable in future years to financial institutions and other
corporations involved in sensitive negotiations.
<P>
"It will certainly be beneficial to many citizens and many other users of
it," says Jim Kallstrom, assistant director of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation's New York field office. "I suspect that it also will be
beneficial, unfortunately, to criminals.
<P>
"I would hope the extremely enterprising and smart people that we have in
this country would work toward solutions that would not only protect the
communication of citizens . . . but would also allow the law enforcement
objectives to be maintained."
<P>
Rubin stressed that while Nautilus was a challenge to write, it "isn't
rocket science." Much of the program, in fact, was assembled from parts
that already were available on the Internet, the worldwide network of
computer networks. It will even be easier to construct programs similar to
Nautilus once Microsoft releases its computer telephony system for Windows
95. "It will be impossible to keep a program like Nautilus out of the
hands of people who want it," Rubin said.
<P>
Gene Spafford, a professor of computer science at Purdue University who is
an expert on computer security, said: "It will be interesting to see what
reaction this provokes from the government." Nevertheless, Spafford said,
in order for encryption to be widely adopted, it will have to be "built
into the phones."
<P>
Dorsey said that anybody in the United States who has Internet access can
download the program. For the instructions, use the Internet FTP command to
connect to the computer FTP.CSN.ORG. Change to the "mpj" directory and
retrieve the file called README. Use a text editor to read the README file,
which contains some fairly complex instructions on how to get the actual
Nautilus file.
<P>
This computer has been set up so that the program cannot be downloaded by
people located outside the United States. "I intend to follow all laws
regarding the release of cryptography," he said.

The May/June 1995 issue of InfoSecurity News reports that Microsoft Bob
(Microsoft's "user-friendly" front end to Windows) has a "feature" that if
you mistype your password three times in a row, it concludes that you've
forgotten it, and asks if you want to change it.  The Microsoft product
manager says "It's not really an attempt at security" (no kidding!).
<P>
If this is what "user-friendly" systems have to offer for security,
I think I'll retreat to the world of paper tape and punch cards!

  Calling-Number-ID Blocking Fails in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin
<P>
  Following the disclosure by the New York Times that Calling-Number-ID 
  blocking had failed in New York State, newspapers report that at least two
  other states have had similar problems with the controversial phone service.
<P>
  The Philadelphia Inquirer reported on March 1 that the phone numbers
  of more than 13,000 Bell Atlantic customers were improperly disclosed.
  Bell Atlantic did not inform the customers or the Public Utility
  Commission for several weeks, until they corrected the problem.  The
  phone company described the problem as "human error" in many cases and
  a software programming error in others.  The Pennsylvania PUC is
  investigating to see if Bell Atlantic violated state law by not
  informing customers of the error when it was discovered.
<P>
  Last month, after the NYNEX problems in New York State were uncovered,
  Ameritech revealed that nearly 1,000 customers in Wisconsin also were
  unprotected after signing up for the service.

STUDENTS SUE COLLEGE OVER COMPUTER COURSE (Edupage, 9 May 1995)
Two students won the lawsuit they brought against New York's Pace University
when an instructor for a beginner's course in computing gave a homework
assignment the students thought was too hard: calculating the price of an
atom of aluminum on Friday given such information as the price of aluminum
on Wednesday, the rate change between the prices of the metal on Wednesday
and Friday, the atomic mass of aluminum, the value of Avogadro's number
(6.02 X 10 to the 23rd power), etc., etc.  The students handled their own
case against the university, and asked the teacher to answer such questions
as: "Do you this was a good choice for a beginning class?"  The judge
decided: "Students are consumers.  There is nothing holy or sacred about
educational institutions."  (Wall Street Journal 5/9/95 A1)
<P>
The judge seemed to mistake the product of educational institutions as being
the work that is given out (rather than the learning that results from doing
the work).
<P>
This article is short on details (did the rest of the class think this was
hard?  Was the grade in the course based heavily on this assignment? How was
the course advertised?). But I cannot imagine the details that would justify
the judge finding for the plaintiffs. (especially since, at heart, this is a
trivial problem).  The only excuse I can think of is that the judge (along
with those students) perceives computers as inherently difficult, and
therefore any course which is not obviously hand-holding the students must
be fundamentally advanced.

I have one to add to the recent article about cellular phones being
banned from hospitals.
<P>
A week ago, one of my fellow sysops had to reboot one of our SUN servers. He
was installing some software on one server when his cellular phone rang and
the console terminal (a VT220-clone) of another server started "hiccupping"
badly. After he power-cycled it, the server had halted and wouldn't start
without a full reboot. As he was sitting there staring at the row of
consoles, his cellular phone rang (again) and another terminal crashed!
This time it was sufficient to "c"ontinue the server so there was only a
halt of a few seconds, but the implication is clear. We carry those cellular
phones to be available quickly in case a server goes down. Instead, the
phone was the cause of a crash.
<P>
The new (European) digital "GSM" cellular standard produces lots of
interference as can be heard on any radio or even HiFi amplifier within a
few feet of a GSM phone in operation. An apparently "idle" phone next to any
critical electronic equipment is a time-bomb waiting to go off since an
incoming call to it automatically triggers bursts of transmissions as the
phone acknowledges the call. This means that banning the use of them may not
be enough - people don't tend to think of just carrying a phone as "using"
it. They must be turned OFF.
<P>
As an aside, the previous (analog) cellular standards did not cause nearly
as much interference despite operating in the same 900 MHz band.  At the
worst, they might "blank out" radio receivers momentarily but we never
observed them interfering with digital equipment. Now, the European Union is
pushing GSM as its sole cellular standard and is trying to force operators
to phase out analog systems to provide more channels for digital. I think
we've only seen the tip of this iceberg yet...

All of the talk of time recently reminded me of an article in the
March/April 1995 issue of "Ocean Navigator" entitled `GPS-derived time
baffles NOAA researcher' written by Dan Endres of the Climate Monitoring and
Diagnostics Lab near Point Barrow, Alaska.
<P>
In this article he discusses the discrepancies he discovered in time as
reported by WWV and his Garmin GPS-50 receiver.  He "found a discrepancy of
up to 1.5 seconds between the time readout of a Garmin GPS-50 and time as
broadcast by WWV."
<P>
He decided to compare several GPS receivers with a GOES synchronized clock
and all of the GPS units showed the same problem.  After a discussion of the
differences between UT (UT0, UT1 (GMT), and UT2), ET, and AT he reports the
assurances of the manufacturers that the GPS units report accurate UT.  What
his own testing found was that the GPS receivers would "start out
displaying time very close to the 486-DC (GOES sync'd clock), and within 15
minutes would drift to settle at between 1 and 1.5 seconds slow."
<P>
After several additional phone calls, a technician (employer not mentioned)
explains that there is indeed a software problem "and that all the
manufacturers were aware of it but not sure how to fix it, or if it was even
worth fixing because of the small error."  The author explains the obvious
risk of shipboard personnel relying upon GPS time for a high degree of
accuracy.
<P>
There are, of course, the usual additional risks of blindly relying on
technology manufactured by people who are reluctant to admit to problems.
The parallels to the Intel FPU situation are clear, though I expect no
outcry from the GPS using population.  They have other, bigger problems
enumerated in earlier editions of RISKS.  The moral is also the usual one:
If the results matter, verify.

I was just reading about proposals for a GPS based Instrument Landing System
to replace current systems (Scientific American, April 1995).  One system
disconnects the autopilot and sounds the alarm if it detects a problem with
the GPS.
<P>
I hope the captain is right on the ball if the autopilot suddenly
disconnects at low level!  It might be better to sound the alarm and let the
captain override the autopilot?

I see several problems with programs that arbitrarily reject dates
before 1753, as Sybase does according to Matthew Healy in Risks 17.11.
<UL>
  <LI>Even if we restrict ourselves to 20th-century dates, it's unwise to
  expect a general-purpose database server to implement the local civil
  calendar accurately.  Some parts of the world did not switch to the
  Gregorian calendar until as late as 1920.  Should a database server
  in, say, Athens reject a 1915 birthday?
<P>
  <LI>Even if we assume locations now in the USA, it's unwise to assume
  that 1753 is the correct cutoff date; Alaska did not switch to the
  Gregorian calendar until 1867.
<P>
  <LI>Several countries switched to the Gregorian calendar as early as
  1582, and it's incorrect to prevent historical applications in these
  countries from using early Gregorian dates merely because England
  hadn't switched yet.
</UL>
In general, it is easier to document, use, debug, and internationalize
programs that assume the Gregorian calendar all the way back to at
least the Year 1.  Specialized applications requiring other calendars
can do conversions as necessary, perhaps using standard conversion
libraries.
<P>
For more on this subject, including an extensive set of conversions
between all sorts of calendars, please see the following references.
Calendrical conversion routines by E M Reingold are widely available as
part of GNU Emacs.

There's an additional risk from the fact that different nations
switched calendars at different times.  Catholic countries switched in
the 1500's, but England didn't because at the time (Henry VIII and
Elizabeth I) the reformation was in full swing and anything Catholic
was bad.
<P>
I saw a comment about this when studying the Spanish Armada.  The
Spanish dates will all be about 10 days off of the English, which
creates problems comparing dates between the records of each country.

Lottery computer gets ahead of itself
<P>
California Lottery officials scrambled Sunday to make amends for a
computer glitch that unexpectedly halted sales three hours early for the
weekend's $3 million jackpot.  By mistake, the computer began issuing
tickets for Wednesday's upcoming drawing instead - causing anger and
confusion for lottery players and retailers around the state...  Lottery
officials decided Sunday that players affected by the mix-up will have
their tickets honored in both contests...  Lottery spokesman said an
employee of Sacramento's GTECH, which runs the lottery computer, was
conducting routine maintenance when he mistakenly entered a command that
closed the draw pool for Saturday's drawing.  ...it wasn't clear how many
tickets were sold during the three hours but GTECH has promised to make up
any losses to the state.
<P>
RISKS?  Where do I start?  Why was an employee able to disturb what is
supposed to be an unriggable game?  If GTECH does not know how many tickets
were sold, how will the loss be made right?  And since when does basic
operator error mean the same thing as "computer glitch?"

A Miami TV Station (WPLG) set up a sting operation on America
Online that resulted in the resignation of a VP at the Denver Post.
<P>
In an attempt to show how easily strangers can approach unsupervised
children on online services, the TV station created an AOL user that
pretended to be a 13 year old boy. A birthdate was clearly listed in a user
profile and the 'boy' spoke like a 13 year old who liked swimming and
skateboarding.
<P>
A user named 'Ken4boys' spoke with this 'boy' in private chats and said that
he would be coming to Florida soon, and asked, "How about a hot-oil massage
from an older guy". Ken4boys did meet an actor at an agreed upon place, but
within seconds found himself facing a TV camera and an investigative
reporter. When this news story made it's way back to Denver, Ken resigned
his position as VP of Marketing at the Denver Post.
<P>
The anonymity of online personas seems a major risk here for all involved.
The TV station was being fraudulent in its attempt to get a juicy sweeps
week story. Still it is worrisome that they were able to find someone who
appeared to use AOL to spice up his business trips. 'Ken4boys' also learned
the danger of anonymity, but it is difficult to feel sympathy for him. I
have been skeptical about the 'PCs are a danger to your kids' stories on
local news, but this is an impressive example.
<P>
I don't think that AOL is too happy about any aspect of this.

Under the headline "Eli Lilly Plans to Use PCS Unit's Database to Boost Drug
Sales" the Wall Street Journal reported on page B6, May 11, 1995 that: "Eli
Lilly &amp; Co. sees big opportunities for expanding use of its Prozac
antidepressant and other drugs by exploring the patient database it acquired
with its $4 billion purchase of PCS Health Systems."
<P>
(Errors in the summary here may be Mark Seecof's fault).  Lilly's CEO
Randall L. Tobias said that patients, as well as Lilly, would benefit from
Lilly's trolling the PCS database of prescriptions for 56 million patients
to find (a) patients whose prescriptions suggest that they may suffer from
depression manifested as several other minor illnesses--Lilly will try to
get doctors to prescribe Prozac for those patients; (b) patients who may be
taking inadvisable combinations of drugs--Lilly will warn its pharmacists
or doctors; (c) drug-treated diabetic patients who might be persuaded to
take to Lilly's Humulin insulin product.
<P>
(The story DOESN'T say) Lilly may find other ways to exploit the
prescription billing data.  For example, Lilly could use it to monitor other
firms' pricing strategies.  Or Lilly could match the data with other
data--for example, Lilly could match prescription billing info against
credit report or insurance (MIB) data then sell derivative information to
people.  (How many landlords will rent to tenants who have prescriptions for
AZT?)
<P>
Various privacy laws may restrict some of the possible uses of the data.
But none of them will protect the people whose medical condition can be
estimated from the record of the drugs prescribed for them from unscrupulous
marketers at Lilly or even faithless clerks at Lilly willing to take bribes
from, say, skip tracers.  I think that Lilly's plan to push Prozac on people
with "backaches and sleeplessness" (direct quote from Tobias) is unethical
and risky.

If you have ever been seriously concerned with developing systems that must
satisfy stringent safety requirements, or expect to be sometime in the
future, you MUST read this book.  Just published, it is immediately the
definitive work on software safety, and has a system perspective that is
really important.  After careful consideration of the fundamentals,
requirements analysis, hazard analysis (including models and techniques),
and human interfaces are examined with loving care.  Many cases familiar to
RISKS readers (Therac-25, Apollo 13, the Challenger, Bhopal, Three Mile
Island, Chernobyl, and others) are treated in considerable detail in the
appendices, and much new information is revealed.  The book is useful as a
course text and as a guidebook for safety engineers.  And it all fits in
680+xvii pp.  Your Risks Moderator says check it out.

Microsoft officials confirm that beta versions of Windows 95 include a
small viral routine called Registration Wizard.  It interrogates every
system on a network gathering intelligence on what software is being run
on which machine.  It then creates a complete listing of both Microsoft's
and competitors' products by machine, which it reports to Microsoft when
customers sign up for Microsoft's Network Services, due for launch later
this year.

<P>
Sometime in the latter part of the summer, Microsoft is planning to release
their Windows95 follow-on for Windows 3.1 to the masses.  Whether the effort
required to keep things working after installing the release vs. the
perceived benefits of Win95 makes the installation a sensible decision is
quite an open question.  Reports from beta testers are indicating that even
for Windows experts, getting their system running again after the upgrade
can be a bad experience, given the wide variety of complex hardware,
drivers, and other components that have been integrated into Windows 3.1
environments over the years.
<P>
For Windows users who are less than experts, the problems risk being even
more serious, with various applications (or even entire systems) effectively
useless without various "tweaks", fixes, new drivers, new software, etc.  In
other words, the backwards compatibility of Win95 in the real world of
people's existing Windows 3.1 installations should be an issue of grave
concern, especially among users concerned about prolonged downtime.
<P>
We may be reaching a stage where the sheer complexity of PC application
software and hardware is making the entire concept of major operating system
upgrades being installed successfully by average users extremely
problematical.  It seems very likely that large numbers of Windows 3.1 users
will (or at least should) be extremely cautious about being an early adopter
of Win95.
<P>
Bya the way, here's a new feature announced for Win95 that carries new RISKS
of its own.  Called "AutoPlay" it is apparently a feature of the Win95
CD-ROM driver that allows CD-ROM authors to create a special init file on
the disc that will automatically start running programs from the disc as
soon as a disc is inserted into the CD-ROM drive.  From the descriptions
available so far, there doesn't seem to be a system-wide way to disable such
a feature, you have to remember to hold down the shift key on your keyboard
while inserting the disc to disable it for that particular insertion
(apparently folks with remote keyboards might just be out of luck!)
<P>
What sorts of harm could come from autoloading of CD-ROMs?  Outside of the
obvious malicious applications (don't laugh, CD-ROMs are getting so cheap to
produce that all manner of nasties could be planted on purpose or by
accident), there's the obvious problem that most PC CD-ROM applications need
considerable software and disk support, often involving significant use of
disk space, changes to system-wide configuration and other driver data, etc.
It is not unusual for these changes to conflict in some manner with other
programs and installations, needing manual intervention.  At least when you
do the installation manually you can stop, look for README files, etc.
before starting the guts of the install, but if the CD-ROM fires off on its
own there's no telling what might happen.
<P>
True, a reasonable CD-ROM author would query the user about this process
rather than running off and starting the install without user input, but
it's probable that many authors who want things to look "slick" won't bother
with this.  In fact, Microsoft seems to be encouraging the "slick" attitude
in their description of this feature.
<P>
Another point.  You're about to start seeing music CDs that carry CD-ROM
programs and data on the initial part of the disc before music track 1.  If
such discs tried to make use of the Win95 AutoPlay feature, an unsuspecting
user who stuck the music disc into his or her CD-ROM player planning to hear
only music (lots of PC users play music CDs on their CD-ROM drives these
days) could end up getting a lot more than bargained for.

|if you mistype your password three times in a row, it concludes that you've
|forgotten it, and asks if you want to change it.
<P>
It's easy to make fun of this scheme, but *I* think it's a pretty good
approach.  This is equivalent of the foil on your vitamins: Not tamperproof
protection, but tamper-*evident* protection.
<P>
This avoids the problems of users who aren't accustomed to password
forgetting them and getting locked out, saving Microsoft technical support a
lot of hassle.  It is intended for home computers, which as a rule are not
widely accessible to the public, and don't have any password protection
currently.  And it's part of a program whose "job" is not security, but user
assistance; it would be inappropriate to add security in such a program that
might lock people out of their computer.
<P>
On the other hand, a scheme that makes it evident if somebody has been
mucking around on the computer is a handy feature, and that's just what has
been achieved here.  (Whether or not the product manager and/or development
team realizes it.)
<P>
I think there is a RISK in assuming that all security must be maximal.

(Not to downplay the RISK in not advertising this for what it is, if
that's what Microsoft is doing.)

&gt;There's an additional risk from the fact that different nations<BR>
&gt;switched calendars at different times.
<P>
Indeed.  Sweden adopted the leap-year rule of the Gregorian calendar in
1700, making it a non-leap year, but without adjusting the calendar
otherwise, so that after that Sweden was out of sync with both Julian and
Gregorian calendars.  After a while they discovered it was not such a great
idea, and in 1712 Sweden moved back to Julian calendar by adding an extra
day to February, resulting in the unusual date of 30 February 1712.  One
should be careful in rejecting "impossible" dates...

<P>
&gt;The new (European) digital "GSM" cellular standard produces lots of<BR>
&gt;interference as can be heard on any radio or even HiFi amplifier
<P>
The risks here are of confusing the behaviour of faulty equipment of one
type with there being a fault in another piece of equipment, and of
generalising that to the behaviour of faulty equipment of a third type.
Also there is a risk of only seeing one side of a two sided problem.
<P>
The fault resulting in the "interference" here is in the amplifier,
which is acting as a radio receiver, or the radio receiver which is
receiving on a completely wrong frequency. (The chances are that the
radio isn't even receiving the interfering signal through its aerial.)
The transmitter can be transmitting a signal which is perfectly
contained within its allocated band, and still generate this effect.
<P>
A lot of modern electronics could be made radio immune, but isn't, to
save a small fraction on the price.  The complex digital logic in a
GSM mobile is immune to its signals from only a few inches away.
<P>
The generalisation is the assumption that audio frequency interference
in an AC coupled device will have the same impact on a DC coupled device
working at 1000s of times the frequency.  In fact, a radio signal which
produced no audible effect at all, might still cause misoperation of
a computer.
<P>
The other side of the coin is that computers which are susceptible to
radio transmissions, are usually very good radio transmitters themselves.
Even PCs, which are designed for domestic use, can cause severe interference
to shortwave receivers, which cannot be cured by modifications to the
receiver (remote aerials apart).  The Sun in this case, probably wasn't
designed to the same standard, so would generate even more interference.
<P>
It is possible that GSM transmissions are more likely to jam susceptible
electronics, but this is not directly related to the audible effect on
faulty amplifiers, but might be the result of using higher peak powers,
although both may be the consequence of using time division multiplexing.

that one needs access to the Internet to participate in this support group?
It seems that even if this group is successful in reducing other Internet
use, the user will continue to use the Internet via e-mail to this account.

<P>
As an engineer who spent 12 hour days programming Fortran in college, and
who now sits in front of a computer all day at work, I thought this would be
of great interest to you.
<P>
On 2/14/95 CBS Evening News with Connie Chung, Dr. Bob Arnot did a story
about negative ions and their effect on mood.  They talked about a study
done at Columbia University where exposure to a high density negative ion
generator was as effective in treating winter depression as medication.
<P>
I became very interested because I have suffered from depression and
anxiety for years, and I did extensive research on the benefits of
negative ions.
<P>
This research turned out to be especially interesting to me because I
found a newspaper article discussing the fact that computer monitors emit
positive ions - the opposite of negative ions.  In the article, a
consultant to the FDA says that computer monitors give off large amounts
of positive ions and can actually cause depression, stress, fatigue, etc.
in people who sit in front of computers a lot - like all of us Netters -
and that we need negative ion replenishment.
<P>
After reading the newspaper article, I realized that I always felt
especially irritable, stressed, and depressed after long days in front of my
computer.
<P>
In doing the research, I found that negative ions have shown to be
therapeutic for stress, irritability, fatigue, depression, etc.  So I
purchased a small, high density generator and it has given me substantial
relief from my symptoms.
<P>
If any of you would like me to e-mail you that newspaper article, the
transcript of the CBS news story, as well as the other research that I
have compiled, just e-mail me at <A HREF="mailto:DanielS222@aol.com">DanielS222@aol.com</A>.

Headline News reported today (18 March 1995) that the nation's two largest
home mortgage underwriters, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, will shortly be
deploying computer systems that will allow for instantaneous analysis of
one's loan application. It appears that, given a user's name, recent
paycheck stub, W-2 form, appraisal etc, the system will perform automated
checks and approve mortgages without the intervention of a human
underwriter.
<P>
"The machine never says no," we are told, if a loan application is
"questionable" it is referred to a human underwriter for review.
<P>
I guess the RISKS are obvious, but I'll state them anyway -- if business is
good, and the human underwriter feels like playing golf instead of reviewing
loans, the loan application may be "referred" to the circular floor-mounted
file cabinet with no substantive explanation to the applicant. The news
story didn't mention whether the algorithm used some simple set of minimal
requirements, or if a neural net or expert system was involved. If the
latter, an even larger and potentially nastier set of RISKS are apparent.

I received a letter in the mail the other day from my credit card company,
kindly informing me that I can get cash with my credit card from any ATM,
and that they had selected a nice random PIN for me.  Lo and behold, the
randomly-selected number was my birthday!  I called the credit card people
up, and the operator was somewhat amused, as she claimed that the number was
"picked by a computer" and it was an "amazing coincidence" that it was my
birthday.  I asked them to pick me a new random PIN, and just yesterday
received a new letter from the bank with my new random PIN, which was
exactly the same as my old random PIN.
<P>
Would it really cut the random number space down too far to remove all
"obvious" dates?  Heck, in this day and age, they probably *know* my
birthday...

I learned the hard way that one can apparently cancel the account of any AOL
(America On Line) member with a simple phone call.  About two weeks ago I
suddenly could not log on to AOL.
<P>
Following the on-screen directions, I called the 800 number for customer
service.  A nice gentleman there explained that someone had called in
earlier in the day and asked for my account to be canceled.  It was!  This
was even though the person calling could not (according to AOL's own
records), provide the credit card number used to pay for the account as
verification of their identity.  The gentleman helping me also volunteered
that an account could be canceled by leaving after-hours voice mail at the
customer service number.
<P>
My woes were exacerbated by an error made when my account was reactivated.
My account was reactivated 10 minutes after my phone call, but my incoming
mail service was not turned on for an additional week.  I had to make a
second (30 minute) phone call to correct this, and wait another day.
<P>
The total lack of verification of who is calling seems to be a poor policy.
What if I had not logged in for three weeks?  I would have lost three weeks
of RISKS!  I tried to suggest that they leave incoming mail enabled for a
few weeks after an account is cancelled without complete verification.  The
people I spoke to didn't seem too interested.

<P>
When I checked into my hotel on a recent business trip, I was told that the
hotel was "having a problem with the locks" and that my room would be
re-keyed sometime the next day.  The room locks in this particular hotel use
plastic cards with magnetic stripes rather than traditional metal keys.
<P>
Sure enough, when I came back the next evening my key wouldn't work; the
room had been re-keyed.  The hotel sent a security person up to let me in
and give me a new key.  He was unable to open the door: the new key didn't
work, nor did any of his master keys.  More security people came, more
master keys, same result; the door would not open.
<P>
Next to arrive were the maintenance people with the lock re-keying device.
This turned out to be a lap-top computer with a special adapter attached to
the serial port.  The locks, it seems, contain battery-operated
microcontrollers.  Re-keying consists of inserting a special master key,
then a second special master key, and then the lap-top computer's re-keying
adapter.  The lap-top then communicates with the processor in the lock and
causes it to register a new key code.
<P>
All this was to no avail -- the lock failed to open regardless of what key
was inserted, whether ordinary room key or master key.  Eventually the
maintenance people had literally to break into the room.
<P>
In discussions with the security people, I learned that what started all
this off was a head crash on a disk.  The hotel had lost track of which key
codes went with which rooms because of the unreadable disk.  As a result,
the front desk couldn't just "write" new keys as guests checked in.  The
hotel started the process of re-keying all the locks in order to create a
new key code file.  This worked OK for all but a couple of the 600+ rooms,
mine being one of the failures.
<P>
Risks?  Obviously, not having a usable backup for the crashed disk is the
first risk.  This cost the hotel lots of employee-hours and some ill will
from frustrated guests, not to mention the physical damage to the door of my
room caused by breaking in.
<P>
The more subtle risk is in the locks themselves.  I had stayed in this hotel
many times before, but I had not noticed that the locks operated ONLY on
magnetic stripe cards.  Many such mag-stripe locks in hotels also have a
traditional, mechanical lock that can be used by the cleaning and security
people even if the mag-stripe mechanism fails completely.  These locks had
no such redundancy.  I'm surprised that the hotel would ever allow itself to
be in the position of being unable to enter a room in an emergency due to
the simple failure of a battery-operated lock controller, other than by
breaking down the door.

From the New York Times
<P>
One 29-year-old woman in Brooklyn in the Home Relief welfare program was
sent more than 200 checks totaling $350,000 over seven months, prosecutors
said.  Five other got $96,950 to $246,925 each, according to the
authorities, who said the welfare recipients then shared the money with
the clerks.  By yesterday evening, 62 welfare recipients were under arrest
and more than 30 were being sought.  [...]
<P>
"It was very easy for the data entry person to do this because there were
absolutely no controls or checks on the computer system," said Howard
Wilson, the Commissioner of the City's Department of Investigation, which
began the inquiry 18 months ago.  "That corrupt employee being at that
critical point in the process was able to literally push the button and
out came the money."
<P>
Prosecutors would not discuss many aspects of the scheme, including how
the clerks and the welfare recipients started working together.
<P>
The risks are obvious, but how much is it a risk of technology vs standard
procedure? Would a supervisor have been more likely to check in a manual
system? Is there more leverage for fraud in the computer-based system? Or is
it just one more example of lax procedures. One can, in fact, argue that
much of the value in computerizing a system is doing a critical evaluation
of existing and new procedures. This step seems to have been omitted in this
case.

US News &amp; World Report, May 15th had a story about a known terrorist being
granted a visa because there wasn't a match on his name in the State
Department's database. To quote the article:
<P>
"The State Department, which issued Khalifa his visa, declines to discuss the
case. A knowledgeable official says that when the U. S. Embassy in Riyadh ran
a check to see if its computer would flag Khalifa's name on the State
Department's terrorism watch list, it failed. The problem is the English
rendering of Arabic names. One State Department official explains, "Mohammad
has several different spellings in English." (My spelling checker had
Mohammed).
<P>
The risks are obvious especially when compared with the small costs for
better (but not perfect) matchin. The more interesting question is the
process by which these things happen. There has been lots of
government-sponsored research into far more difficult problems. Why does this
knowledge not extend to critical systems outside the well funded security
services? Perhaps for the same reasons that our air traffic control system is
a creaky antique.
<P>
Usual caveat: the news article might be wrong and maybe there are entirely
different issues here. With very nonEnglish common names and mixed standards
for identification, the problem is more difficult than just soundex.

In an article by Susan Carey headlined "Three Market Researchers Team Up to
Provide Data for On-Line Services" the Wall Street Journal reported on page
B7, Wednesday 17 May 1995, that ``Three of the nation's leading
market-research concerns have teamed up to develop research services for the
on-line world.''
<P>
(Errors in the following summary may be M. Seecof's fault.)  Since measuring
``hit rates'' on WWW pages and like resources isn't a very effective or very
informative method of measuring interest or usage (especially with large
ISP's planning to cache data from popular servers to improve response time
to their customers--effectively masking such usage from the real
providers--and, BTW, the copyright and other issues here deserve a separate
discussion to which I hope to contribute at another time), Neilsen Media
Research (yes, the TV ratings folks), Yankelovich Partners, and ASI Market
Research plan to develop and deploy means of measuring first WWW and later
other kinds of Internet resource usage and provide such information to
clients.  Their joint venture is called ANYwhere Online.
<P>
(The article did NOT say...) I think this is interesting.  Ideally, one
wants data not just from servers instrumented by ANYwhere Online
(hereinafter ANY-O) but from other servers as well.  In the TV world,
Neilsen measures usage of all servers (TV stations/videotape) by a sample of
the client population and extrapolates by statistical inference to usage by
the whole client population.  One could certainly do this in the Internet
world.  But consider another tactic.  One could instrument Internet routers
or links and measure traffic to various destinations.  I suspect that Bill
Gates intends to instrument UUNET/AlterNet's backbone to gather data on his
competitors.  For a fee, he could provide a digest of such information to
ANY-O (or anyone).  Other commercial ISP's could do likewise.  This kind of
traffic analysis could be exploited for commercial or other purposes.  I
look forward to learning from ANY-O whether they will use TV/
radio-measuring tactics, data from selected servers, data from backbone
traffic analysis, or some combination.
<P>
I would like to point out what I see as a big RISK for people who don't want
their traffic analyzed (whether for personal, or commercial-competitive
reasons): no current commercial ISP promises NOT to collect and sell
information about net usage by customers.  We can use end-to-end encryption
(e.g., PGP) to limit content snooping by ISP's but typical public-access or
commercial services, via e.g., WWW protocols use cleartext.  Even if we
expect the quantity of such traffic to hamper content-snoops, traffic
analysis by or with the cooperation of ISP's could have grave competitive or
privacy implications.  I think that commercial Internet users should demand
privacy clauses in their contracts with ISP's *NOW*, because tomorrow it'll
be too late.

A few months ago, our computing organization invited our EDP auditors in to
have a look at backup procedures. One of the findings in the auditor's
report was "there are no established procedures for preservation of magnetic
media to provide assurance of the long-term integrity of archived data.
Also, no written standards exist that denote when specific types of magnetic
media are to be retired. The only procedure observed is that generally
magnetic media are not reused if a read or write error has occurred."
<P>
We are wondering what other organizations have in the way of established
procedures to provide assurance of the long-term integrity of archived data,
and standards on when specific types of magnetic media are to be retired.
<P>
Any comments or suggestion would be greatly appreciated.

<P>
I was recently plotting some data originating from a measurement and data
logging program on a PC under MS DOS.
<P>
To my surprise, the time on my plot was not increasing monotonously;
rather, it was occasionally jerking backwards by a considerable amount
for a single data point. I took a look at the raw data file to try to
discover what happened. It appeared that the first data point after
each midnight (the test was running for several days) still had the
date of the previous day.
<P>
I consulted the author of the software who gave the following, rather
alarming explanation:
<P>
In DOS, the time and the date are updated by separate interrupts. The
time update has higher priority than the date update (I wonder what the
logic behind the different priorities is?? The only explanation I can
think of is: The date is updated less frequently, so it has less
priority, which is not a very sound reasoning).
<P>
It is, therefore, possible to read out the date and time at a moment
just after midnight where the time has been updated, but the date is
still the old one.
<P>
In our application, a measurement is triggered at given times, one of
which is exactly midnight. The measurement generates a lot of activity
for a few seconds, preventing the date interrupt from getting served
for some time.
<P>
As a result, the first measurement of each new day consistently has the
time 00:00:06, and the date of the previous day.
<P>
Our application is probably rather exceptional in allowing the wrong day to
persist for seconds. More common applications may only see this for
milliseconds or microseconds, so not many people are likely to ever see the
problem. (We could get into a long discussion, similar to the Pentium
arguments, whether this is good or bad. I will spare you this).
<P>
I will also spare you a discussion of possible work-arounds. What remains is
the amazing fact that anybody can dream up a system in which the updating of
date and time is not an atomic operation.

<P>
I've been using win95 for over year now, so can probably make some fairly
accurate comments.
<P>
Firstly, I don't know about the "Registration Wizard", but that's because
I can't connect to the Microsoft Network. It seems that whoever entered
the table of area codes got Bristol's revised code wrong.
<P>
Secondly, the latest beta releases are a lot easier to install than the
early builds, and a lot of legacy hardware and software does work -more
than with Windows NT for example. It is of course useful to have a sheet
of paper listing your IP address, subnet mask and DNS server, because you
will be asked these questions near the end of the installation, when it
is too late to look at the old files to find these facts out.
<P>
Finally, Autorun does seem a nice concept, and certainly for home users
it makes sense in terms of ease of use. It's cool for audio disks.
<P>
It is claimed to work on any "disk drive" which supports removable media
and automatic insertion notification. That means CD-ROMS, PCMCIA Cards
and perhaps floppy drives on "Windows 95" PCs which can indicate the
presence or absence of a floppy disk.
<P>
Now personally I like the idea of scanning a new disk for viruses, even
if it does take forever on a large CDROM, so was a bit unhappy about the
concept of autorun disks. After a bit of research I found that there is
an entry in the Registry which lets you choose which program gets run, or
possibly disable autoplay altogether. So in fact it may be possible to
configure autoplay to run a virus scanner over every new disk...

"In Short" column, page 88, _Information Week_ magazine, May 22, 1995:<BR>
:   Microsoft officials confirm that beta versions of Windows 95 include a<BR>
:   small viral routine called Registration Wizard.
<P>
The word `viral' here is quite inappropriate.  Moreover, the column makes
it seem as if this information is collected covertly and secretly uploaded.
<P>
Here's what happens, or at least, what happens today.  (Things might change
before the final release.)  When you select "Online Registration", the
"Registration Wizard" fires up and asks you the same sorts of questions that
would be asked by a paper registration form: name, address, etc.  It then
does a hardware scan, displays its findings, and asks you, "Do you wish to
include this information with your registration?"  Then it does a software
scan of the local machine (not "every system on a network" as originally
reported), displays its findings, and asks for the same confirmation to
upload.  This is all quite explicit, and users are required to confirm
whether or not to include the information in the registration.  There is no
default response, so an inattentive user cannot just keep hitting Return and
end up uploading the information by mistake.
<P>
After the questions are answered, additional prompts and confirmations
appear before the phone is dialed.
<P>
Other points for debate/discussion: There is no way to edit the hardware or
software inventory.  So if the hardware or software list is incorrect or
contains information that you'd rather not upload (e.g., beta hardware or
software), your only recourse is to suppress the information entirely.

A New York state trial court ruled on 24 May 1995 that Prodigy is
responsible for the libelous statements of its users because it exercises
editorial control over their posts. In the case, an anonymous Prodigy user
made statements against New York Investment firm Stratton Oakmont accusing
it of criminal and fraudulent acts. Stratton Oakmont sued Prodigy and the
volunteer moderator of the forum where the statements were published.
<P>
The Court found that Prodigy was acting as a publisher and therefore was
responsible for the content of the posts. The Court distinguished the case
from the earlier Cubby v. Compuserve decision, which found that Compuserve
was subject to the standards of a bookstore or library. It that case, the US
District court ruled that Compuserve had no editorial control over the text.
According to the New York state court:
<P>
In contrast, here Prodigy has virtually created an
editorial staff of Board Leaders who have the ability to
continually monitor incoming transmissions and in fact do
spend time censoring notes. Indeed, it could be said that
Prodigy's current system of automatic scanning,
guidelines, and Board Leaders may have a chilling effect
on freedom of communications in Cyberspace, and it appears
that this chilling effect is exactly what Prodigy wants,
but for the legal liability that attaches to such censorship.
<P>
Let it be clear that this court is in full agreement with
Cubby and Auvil. Computer bulletin boards should generally
be regarded in the same context as bookstores, libraries
and network affiliates...It is Prodigy's own policies,
technology and staffing decisions which have altered the
scenario and mandated the finding that it is a publisher.
<P>
The court also attempted to downplay the significance of its
decision on the greater area of electronic networks:
<P>
Prodigy's conscious choice, to gain the benefits of editorial
control, has opened it up to greater liability that Compuserve
and other computer networks that make no such choice. For the
record, the fear that this Court's finding of publisher status
for Prodigy will compel all computer networks to abdicate
control of their bulletin boards, incorrectly presumes that
the market will refuse to compensate a network for its
increased control and the resulting increased exposure.
<P>
The Court also found that the volunteer "Board Leader" of the Prodigy
Bulletin Board was acting as an agent of the company. The Court found
Prodigy exercised control over the Board Leaders though the the Bulletin
Board Leader Agreement and the actions of Prodigy's employees.
<P>
Prodigy has said that it will consider appealing the decision. EPIC has
materials on free speech available at <A HREF="http://epic.org/free_speech/">http://epic.org/free_speech/</A> We will
be making a copy of the decision available in the next few days.

Hacker High, by RAYNER PIKE,	Associated Press Writer
<P>
NEW YORK (AP) -- Some of New York's best and brightest set out
to show that they can rush in where high schoolers are not
supposed to tread -- the computer systems of Ivy League colleges.
They succeeded. Their principal was not amused. Their victims
were not impressed.  The systems of Columbia and Princeton, as well
as Bucknell University, were targeted by hackers from the elite
Stuyvesant High School.
<P>
Key points:
<UL>
<LI>Principal said, "No harm was done and none was intended."
<P>
<LI>School adding ethics classes to computer courses.
<P>
<LI>Bucknell University staff said the hack was a prank and not slick.
<P>
<LI>"...students got a couple of Bucknell passwords and used them to
send E-mail. They left one note without removing coding that
tracked the sender back to Stuyvesant, a public school for
academically gifted children."
<P>
<LI>Students used one Columbia University ID but no obvious damage.
<P>
<LI>Princeton IDs and passwords obtained but apparently not used.

Making the On-Line Community Safe for Decency -- and Democracy<BR>
By John Schwartz<BR>
Washington Post Staff Writer<BR>
<P>
Sen. James Exon sounds for all the world like a man who's ready
to make a deal. Sitting in his Capitol office, the Nebraska
Democrat puffs amiably on his pipe and discusses the bill that
has made him anathema to many people in the on-line community,
the Communications Decency Act.
<P>
Exon's bill, part of the Senate version of a broad
telecommunications bill, would impose jail terms and fines on
those who create or solicit on-line material that is deemed
"obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent."
<P>
Key points:
<UL>
<LI>Massive opposition from all sectors, including the Dept of Justice.
<P>
<LI>"For the record, Exon has no personal experience on-line, but
says he finds the positive uses of the networks exciting."
<P>
<LI>Christian Coalition's <A HREF="http://www.cc.org">http://www.cc.org</A> home page has support for such restrictions.
<P>
<LI>Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) wants to clamp down on anarchist files.
<P>
<LI>The author writes:
<P>
...a Justice Department memo ... describes the bill as an
enforcement nightmare that would criminalize constitutionally
protected speech. The memo concluded it would clash with other
laws and "hamper the government's ongoing work in stopping the
dissemination of obscenity and child pornography and threaten
law  enforcement's continued ability to use court-authorized
wiretaps."
<P>
<LI>The Exon bill would make materials which are legally available
in print illegal if obtained online.
<P>
<LI>Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-VT) proposes to help parents exercise
greater control over their children's access to cyberspace using
technology--"lockout boxes" like devices being made available to
cable-TV subscribers.
<P>
<LI>The author quotes Sen. Leahy:
<P>
"To say that everyone using the Internet is going to be held
to the standard of my neighbor's 7-year-old child is wrong --
and is going to cripple the Internet," said Leahy....
Overly restrictive legislation, he said, "will make one of
the best free-enterprise experiments a hollow shell."
<P>
<LI>The article ends with signposts for further information:
<P>
The Exon bill is a hot topic on-line. You can find World Wide
Web sites devoted to the bill at <A HREF="http://www.cdt">http://www.cdt</A>. org and

limited to e-mail can get information by sending a message
to cda-infocdt.org in which the text area is left blank and
the subject line reads send-events. Sending the same message
to cda-statcdt.org will get you the current status of the bill.

Defying pitfalls of a cashless society<BR>
Victor Keegan  (The Guardian, Economics Notebook, 30 May 1995)
<P>
The kingdom of cash is starting to be attacked in a pincer movement:
from in front, by electronic, or digital, cash, and from behind, by the
growing popularity of the barter system Letts - artificial local currencies
(rather like a baby-sitting points system), which people use instead of
real money to pay each other for services rendered.  [...]
<P>
The world's central banks -- including the Bank of England -- are beginning
to wake up to the fact that digital money could pose a threat to their
hegemony. This is particularly true of the so-called "electronic purses"
(like Mondex, which Midland Bank and others are pioneering) and, much more
so, the digital (and untraceable) cash being-pioneered by DigiCash, the
Amsterdam-based company.  [...]  As long as these are issued by banks-like
Midland's Mondex-then it is nothing more than another bank deposit, albeit
in electronic form.  [...]
<P>
Central banks have been sufficiently worried about the provision of
electronic purses getting into the wrong hands to set up a working group of
the European Monetary Institute. The conclusion was predictable: they are
all right-so long as they are restricted to approved credit institutions
(that is, banks), so that they can be properly monitored.
<P>
Enter DigiCash, whose founder, the proselytising David Chaum, wants to
create a digital system which could assume a life of its own. He has even
patented a process whereby a bank or a company could validate a secret
number which could be used as a unit of currency even though the issuing
authority could not trace it.
<P>
The place just waiting for such anonymous digital money (which would also be
rather useful for kidnappers and launderers of drug money) is the Internet,
the worldwide electronic cobweb of computer data bases.  [...]
<P>
Should the Net be provided with its own currency, it would suddenly become
not only a global market place, but a virtual economy as well. It could
become the first economy without a government or even a central bank at the
centre. But if there is no government, no one will pay taxes.  [...]
<P>
We are not talking science fiction. Mr Chaum has already distributed a
million digitised dollars to 5,000 pioneers taking part in a trial. Their
Cybercash can be spent purchasing goods and services from 50 companies
taking part in the trial.
<P>
At the other end of the scale, the growth of Lett schemes is not yet a
problem, if only because most of the schemes are small-scale and the people
involved are probably earning below the threshold at which they would be
required to pay tax. In a typical scheme one member might help another
build a wall, thereby earning himself currency points, to be exchanged for
work by someone else or for buying goods.
<P>
If such a scheme went nationwide and electronic (so that the participants
carried their points on a micro-chip on a plastic card), this could quickly
evolve into electronic money effectively outside the control of the banking
system and on which the participants would be reluctant to pay tax. The
transactions might even take place through the Internet.
<P>
Of course, central banks will move quickly if they feel their supervisory
role and their divine right to print money is being challenged. The point is
that the financial world is moving into uncharted waters. The change could
be as far-reaching as the transition from metals to money in the last
century.
<P>
[What I found interesting was the way this article tied together (hi-tech)
developments related to digital cash and the rise in popularity, at least
here in the UK, of (typically low-tech) barter schemes.  BR]

The date/time discussion illustrates two more global risks related issues.
<OL>
<LI>There is a risk from overconfidence and lack of proper analysis when the
subject matter is something you have known "completely" since childhood.
People often get very excited or upset when they realize that there is
significant hidden complexity.  Most of us have achieved our full
understanding of time by the age of ten.  It has no more mysteries (except
perhaps time zones).  Discovering just how much more there is to time and
its measurement is a surprise.
<P>
QUIZ: For a more timely example than 18th century calendars, when does
Sunday become Monday?  (See below)
<P>
<LI>There is a significant misunderstanding around the relative merits
of integer vs floating point notation in general.
<P>
If your real world process can be represented as a finite field mapped onto
the integers, then you can eliminate concerns regarding representation
error.  This makes an integer representation attractive because it reduces
your error analysis problem to:
<OL>
<LI>Prove that the finite field mapping is correct.
<P>
If your application involves division, you don't have a finite field.
You also better be sure that the finite field mapping is understood
the same way by all involved.  It can be a big problem if well into
your project you discover that you need additional resolution.  So
don't skip this step.
<P>
<LI>Analyze the error characteristics of your algorithms in the
confident knowledge that the errors have been reduced to:
<P>
initial error = measurement error, and
results error = numerically propagated measurement errors.
</OL>
Lots of people seem to think that you can skip the numerical analysis just
because your operations are on a finite field.  This is not the case.
Measurement error is still present and it still propagates.  I've seen too
many instances where people omit the error analysis because "integer
computations are error free".  You may have a finite field, but measurement
error must still be analyzed.
<P>
Still, the analysis is simpler and integers are often an excellent
representation for measured data.
<P>
With floating point representation, you have different advantages:
<OL>
<LI>Much greater dynamic range
<LI>Much more uniform error characteristics (always present, but
lacking the sudden lurch that occurs when your finite field mapping
fails.)
<LI>The psychological pressure to analyze errors because some error
is always present.
</OL>
The difficulty is that your error analysis is harder:
<P>
initial error = measurement error + representation error
results error = propagated measurement error +
propagated representation error +
representation error.
<P>
This can be more work, although I have found that in most real world
situations the measurement errors have dominated.  Usually I could
completely ignore representation error because the measurement errors
were orders of magnitude larger.
</OL>
Oh, and the answer to the quiz:
<P>
It depends upon what part of the world you are in.  In some areas,
the day ends at sunset.  So during some parts of the year, 1730
(local) Sunday occurs before 1800 (local) Sunday, and in other parts
of the year it occurs after.  And you need to know the latitude and
longitude to figure out when sunset occurs.  Is it any wonder that
people who care about time quickly end up using UTC for everything.
But this is a lurking trap for the unwary who want to make a properly
internationalized application that allows the use of local time.

My attempts to reach the long-distance operator from my Washington DC hotel
instead connected me to a voice-activated interface instructing me to say
"Operator" to get through, but my British pronunciation clearly didn't sound
right.  I found I could get through with a phony American "ahperader" but
only on the second attempt, the first attempt always getting a lengthy
recorded apology and a repeat of the (even lengthier) instructions.  Out of
frustration, I resorted to dialling the number direct, for which my hotel
charged me $95 for a call that would otherwise have cost $52.
<P>
It seems strange to require long-distance callers from DC hotels, many of
whom are presumably foreigners trying to reach overseas, to speak with an
American accent.  No alternative means of reaching the operator is offered,
and this could be a source of risk in emergency situations.  When I got
through to the supervisor to point this out, she agreed, but said, "You could
have dialled zero instead."  Why didn't I think of trying this?  But the
recorded instructions say nothing about this option.

Subject: Network Attack Mars Internet Show<BR>
Date: 22 May 1995 13:51:29 GMT<BR>
Organization: Internet ProLink NZ, Auckland<BR>
<P>
Last week (15-20 May) Internet ProLink NZ, along with InfoTech Weekly,
TUANZ, Megascreen, Atrium on Elliott, and Dymocks, sponsored a week
long series of free Internet demonstrations at the Atrium in Auckland.
<P>
The event was marred by an attack on our system during the first three
days of the show.  The intent appears to have been to deny us the use
of our Internet connection during the show.
<P>
This posting should serve as a warning to system administrators.  Note
that eliminating these types of attacks requires filtering at the site
to whom you are connected, and that similar attacks with the traffic
destined to routers can be difficult to monitor.
<P>
Monday:<BR>
Thousands of ICMP echo packets each minute from 202.36.227.10
(mserve.cybernet.co.nz) saturate our link in both directions.
These high priority packets almost completely prevent us from
using our link at all.
<P>
The packets initially were sent to iprolink.co.nz, but later
to router1.iprolink.co.nz.
<P>
The attack lasted approximately two hours from about 2:15 pm and
stopped when we unplugged our link for several minutes.
<P>
Tuesday:<BR>
ICMP packets sent to our router again completely saturate our
link.  Attack begins around noon and ends when the University
of Auckland temporarily disconnects Cybernet's link.
<P>
Wednesday:<BR>
TCP packets (again from mserve.cybernet.co.nz) were sent to
ports 7, 8, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,
18, and finally port 19 on iprolink.co.nz, where our outbound
link was saturated with traffic for more than one hour.  No
further attacks were seen after Cybernet was contacted by the
University of Auckland.
<P>
Our apologies to those who turned up for the show during these attacks

<P>
I have the pleasure of presenting one of the most absurd claims I've read in
the mainstream press in a long time.
<P>
In the Minneapolis Star Tribune, Monday, May 22, 1995, on page 10A, yet
another inflammatory article about the Internet appeared, titled
``Cyberstoned''.  The article is adapted from Boston Magazine, written by
Stephen Rodrick at Boston Magazine and Vladimir Edelman, a Boston-based
freelance writer.
<P>
The point of the article was that there is drug dealing on the net, and that
there are net-specific problems for law enforcement.  I agreed with parts of
the article, e.g. that law enforcement needs to learn about the net, that
freedom of information and anonymity make law enforcement more difficult,
etc.  The writers give away their position when they report that ``after
Internet zealots howled about the loss of privacy, the fate of the Clipper
chip remains in doubt,'' but I forgive them.
<P>
Then they make an absurd pronouncement backed up by scant evidence:
<P>
In fact, much of the cyberspace revolution of virtual reality, the
Internet and other high-speed technology burst out of the minds of
computer geniuses spaced out on drugs such as acid and ecstasy.  In his
book *Cyberia: Life in the Trenches of Hyperspace*, Douglas Rushkoff
traces the creation of the drug culture's special place on the Internet.
<P>
`Developments in the computer industry and on the Internet are being made
by the same people who made the counterculture of the '60s possible.
Those willing to explore hallucinatory dreamlike realms that didn't exist
before -- never-before-navigated turf of consciousness,' Rushkoff says.
<P>
I have a master's degree in computer science from the University of
Minnesota, and I read newspapers with regularity if not often.  I cannot
recall a single story about the arrest for drug possession of a computer
scientist familiar to me from their academic work.  Abramson, Tannenbaum,
Liskov, Stonebraker, Lazowska, not to mention my own professors and numerous
others have all thus far managed to hide their dirty little secret.
<P>
The risks?  Reporters who are not knowledgeable about computer science.
This risk generalizes easily: lawyers who are not knowledgeable about
computer science, patent clerks, politicians, bureaucrats, ..
<P>
If the two quoted paragraphs about "much of the cyberspace revolution"
coming from druggies annoyed you as much as it did me, please email the
Op-Ed page of the Minneapolis Star Tribune at <A HREF="mailto:opinion@startribune.com">opinion@startribune.com</A>.

cannot use an ioniser in my office as whenever it I switch it on I get SCSI

It appears that PGN was duped in <A HREF="/Risks/17.14.html">RISKS-17.14</A> by what one poster in
news.admin.net-abuse.misc calls "the slow spammer."  The user who submitted
the message about "positive-ion dangers" was not doing it out of the
goodness of his heart or because he felt it was an appropriate, current
topic for RISKS.  He was doing it, I believe, because he sells negative-ion
emitters.  He has been slowly spamming his message to many newsgroups for
some time now.

"If they built buildings they way we build software...."
<P>
There's a fascinating article in the current issue of The New Yorker
("The Fifty-Nine-Story Crisis", Joe Morgenstern, The New Yorker, vol. LXXI,
no. 14, May 29, 1995, pp. 45-53) that should be of great interest to all
with an interest in software engineering.  It's the story of the discovery
and patching of a design/implementation flaw in a 59-story building in New
York City (the Citicorp Center) that had the potential to cause the building
to collapse disastrously under high winds.
<P>
The parallels with software are uncanny, because the reasons the
problem occurs are exactly the things that occur in so many software projects:
<OL>
<LI>An unusual or novel aspect to the problem. (Building around an existing
structure, a church).
<P>
<LI>A creative, innovative solution that required new design &amp; analysis.
(Putting the main support columns in the middle of each side of the
building, rather than at the corners.)
<P>
<LI>Not quite getting all the implications &amp; analysis of the innovation
right.  (The reviewers of the design treated some special, new
diagonal wind braces as trusses rather than columns, thereby
disregarding a required standard and exempting them from a safety
standard.)
<P>
<LI>A critical change in the specification made by the contractor during
construction to save time &amp; money that was not reflected back to the
designers and/or re-analyzed/reviewed for its impact that greatly
weakened the design.
<P>
<LI>A resulting flaw that would only show up in heavy load, and not
under normal use/test.
</OL>
Anyone interested in making software engineering a profession
will also find the article of interest.  Everyone involved exhibited
a high degree of professionalism throughout the discovery, analysis,
and fixing of the problem. (Even the lawyers!)   Another amazing thing
is that there's been little if any publicity of this before (at least
to my knowledge; this is the first report I remember seeing).  Part of
that may be due to the fact there just happened to be a newspaper
strike going on in New York City at the crucial time.)
<P>
WARNING:  Do not start reading this until you have time to finish it; I
found it a case of "can't put it down" reading.
<P>
[Note: I'm unable to always follow the risks forum closely, but haven't
seen anything on this in there, either recently or in the past.
It will certainly appeal to risks readers.  Apologies if others
have submitted this or it's been covered in the past &amp; I just missed
it, in which case simply hit the delete key.  Might note also that
if people find this interesting, an interesting book on similar
things that I read a couple of years ago while doing some investigating
on operating system reliability is: "Why Buildings Fall Down", by
Matthys Levy &amp; Mario Salvador, New York, W.W. Norton, 1992.  One of
the conclusions is that many buildings fail due to a lack of redundancy,
which I find very interesting since very few operating systems (or
software of any kind) has any kind of redundancy designed or built
into it.]

After the failure of the main cryogenic motor earlier in May resulted in the
death of two technicians, another test on 30 May (in Cayenne, French Guiana)
was aborted by the computer control system several seconds after ignition of
the new European rocket.  I suppose this case counts as a success story for
computers, but a failure for the rocket motor.  PGN [Source: A Reuters item,

<P>
On 31 May 1995, I heard a story about GPS on NPR-All Things Considered of
interest to RISKS readers. Apologies for any omissions, I didn't take notes
so the following is from memory.
<P>
A "blue-ribbon" panel just issued a report on whether to open all of the
satellite-based Global Positioning System (GPS) to civilian use. As it works
now, GPS transmits a low-resolution signal for civilian use, which has
random errors added to it (resolution: about 100m), and an encrypted signal
for military use that's much more precise.  The civilian capability was made
available worldwide after the KAL 007 downing over Soviet Airspace during
the Reagan administration, and it is now widely used not just by ships and
planes, but also by hikers and tourists (a palmtop GPS locator sells for
about $300 in the US).
<P>
The panel concluded that the hi-res signal had to be opened to use by all.
The military's objection is that enemies could use it to e.g. guide missiles
(one of their own applications) to US targets.  They're proposing that the
error may be increased, or the system turned off altogether, at the
discretion of the US President, in "time of war".  Civilian aviation
authorities aren't thrilled about using a system on which they don't have
their "hand on the switch," as an official from the British aviation
authority said.
<P>
The cat may already be out of the bag. FAA is testing a system that uses the
civilian GPS on an aircraft in concert with a ground-based civilian GPS,
through a radio link. Since the ground based GPS knows its coordinates, it
can listen to the signal from satellites, figure the error, and inform its
airborne partner. Precision is in the 1 meter range now, enough to put a
plane on a glide path and land it in dense fog.
<P>
The various RISKs are left as an exercise to the reader.

Finally, after months of delay and postponement, a 26 year old
unemployed computer programmer, Chris Pile, pleaded guilty Friday,
May 26, to eleven charges related to computer virus writing. The
case at Plymouth Crown Court was the first of its kind in British legal
history since passage of the Computer Misuse Act in 1990.
<P>
Pile, known as the Black Baron, pleaded guilty to hacking into business
computers and planting the computer viruses known as SMEG/Pathogen and
SMEG/Queeg. The case followed an investigation by fraud squad officers and
experts from Scotland Yard. The eleven charges stemmed from a period between
October 1993 and April 1994 when the Black Baron obtained unauthorized
access to computer programs and seeded them with viruses he'd written. He
also pleaded guilty to one charge of inciting others to plant his viruses.
Authorities state that tracing the viruses and repairing damage caused by
them cost "well in excess of half a million pounds." Pile was released on
bail and the trial adjourned for two months to allow the defence to prepare
a pre-sentencing report.
<P>
Pile, a Devon man, wrote the SMEG viruses which quickly gained the attention
of anti-virus developers worldwide in mid-1994. Due to publicity on the nets
and in the computer underground, they were rapidly distributed around the
Internet at approximated the same time Pile was arrested in connection with
the charges on which he was tried.
<P>
Sentencing will probably depend upon the interpretation of Pile's intent to
incite others to write viruses using his "SMEG" encryption kernel which was
distributed internationally to virus exchange underground bulletin board
systems in mid-1994. It is an arcane issue which calls for the examination
and tracking of a computer archive containing a detailed technical "how-to"
on installing Pile's "SMEG" virus encryption kernel into new viruses, the
encryption software and a sample demonstration virus.
<P>
In 1993, another English virus writer, Stephen Kapp, was arrested in
connection with telephone fraud charges.  Kapp was known as the "President
of ARCV," or ARCV virus writing group which stood for Association of Really
Cruel Viruses.
<P>
It is worth noting that in 1992 at the height of the Michelangelo virus
scare, few virus writers were easily identified.  This is no longer the
case. Due to the growth in computer networks and an increasing desire for
underground network celebrity, many of the most prominent virus writers in
the world live in plain sight.
<P>
Australia's Clinton Haines, a student at the University of Queensland, is
responsible for writing and putting the Dudley and NoFrills computer viruses
into the wild in his country.  At various times since 1992, these viruses
have infected SunCorp, a large Australian insurance firm; Australian Telecom
and the Australian Taxation Office, which is similar to the IRS.  Haines has
been interviewed at length by the Australian newsmedia.
<P>
In America, James Gentile, a teenager living in San Diego, has written a
number of viruses, all of which have emerged in the wild.  His Satan Bug
crashed US Secret Service networks in 1993.  Since then another of his
creations, known as Natas - Satan spelled backwards - has become one of the
most common computer viruses in North America. It has been reported as far
south in the hemisphere as Argentina.

William Cheswick, a senior researcher at Bell Labs, thinks the Internet is
risky business and "a bad neighborhood," in which "hackers can eavesdrop on
the packet flow...  It is past time for the deployment of encrypted
sessions."  But investment banker and consultant Ted Prince says: "What we
have is a tiny number of hacker incidents that have been blown out of
proportion by the tabloid technoliterati... You have more chance of getting
your credit-card number stolen in a restaurant or on a phone in Grand
Central Station than you do of having it stolen on the Internet."
(Computerworld 5/29/95 p.96)

Pricey Pay Phones,, By JEANNINE AVERSA, Associated Press Writer
<P>
WASHINGTON (AP, 29 May 1995) -- Between appointments, Mary Viar dashed to a
pay phone in Hagerstown, Md., to wish her daughter in Pittsburgh a happy
birthday. A week later, she got the bill: $21.39 for her 22-minute call.
For the same amount, she could have called Paris and talked for half an hour.
<P>
Key points:
<UL>
<LI>FCC handling growing number of complaints about unexpectedly
high prices for calls made through pay-phones:  4,280 complaints
in the last 12 months.
<P>
<LI>Beware of phones controlled by "MD-based Oncor Communications,
whose rates are three to four times as high as those of the
big phone companies."
<P>
<LI>Users have filed 800 complaints to the FCC about Oncor's rates.
<P>
<LI>Hotels and pay-phone owners charge the high rates even if user
requests connection to their own lower-cost carrier.
<P>
<LI>Users can bypass the automatic charges by rogue phone companies
by dialling directly to use their own 800 or 950 access codes
for more reasonable phone carriers.
<P>
<LI>Some companies add a surcharge to each call and share the revenue/
with "the hotel, bar or other establishment where a public phone
is located...."
<P>
<LI>"The FCC said Oncor's surcharges alone have totaled as much
as $10 per call."
</UL>
In a related article, the author included the following information:
<P>
If you believe you have been unfairly charged for a long-distance
call, you can file a complaint to the FCC, which oversees
interstate service. For local calls, contact the state's
public utility commission, which oversees local phone service.
You may also want to send a letter to the state attorney general,
many of whom have raised concerns about rate gouging.
<P>
Complaints may be sent to the Federal Communications Commission,
Enforcement Division, 2025 M Street, N.W., Washington, D.C.,
20554. Additional information also can be obtained by calling
the FCC at 202-418-0190.

Last week I was trying to use my cellular phone in Seattle. I couldn't get
it to work because it is a Boston based phone and the Boston database was
being upgraded last week and, basically, got screwed up. I didn't now about
this till Thursday evening but apparently it was a week long problem
according to the Boston Cellular One. The Seattle people said that they
couldn't do anything about it. The first time I called customer support the
suggested solution was to power off and try again in a little while since
they were clueless as to the cause of the problem. Later I spoke to someone
who was more familiar yet was still unable to help.
<P>
Perhaps no one really roams on these phones, but one would think a major
outage like this would get more attention and be taken more seriously. But
then, the reality of the cellular network is that it is not a reliable
service. Before automatic roaming you'd have to register locally but that
was only available on a 9 to 5 basis.
<P>
Perhaps this is a nonrisk. By not providing a really reliable service,
people are not going to be overly dependent upon the network. Actually, they
will be dependent upon it for emergency services until the first emergency
...

<P>
A recent trade publication article contained inaccuracies regarding the
purpose and operation of the Registration Wizard, the on-line registration
application in Windows 95.  The purpose of the Registration Wizard is to
offer an electronic version of the paper-based Registration Card that
traditionally comes with all Microsoft products.  The Registration Wizard
asks for similar information to that listed in the paper-based registration
card, such as your hardware configuration and applications usage.  Just like
with a traditional registration card, providing this information is
optional.  A customer using the Registration Wizard receives dialog prompts
asking them whether they would like to send this information.  They must
actively click 'send' for any information to be sent.
<P>
There are lots of benefits to customers that provide this information - such
as product update mailings and improved product support because the product
support engineer can refer to your exact system configuration information
on-line.  In the end, though, sending this information is optional and a
conscious decision by the user.
<P>
Microsoft traditionally does not make information gathered during the
registration process available to third-parties.  If the customer chooses to
send system and software information to Microsoft with the Registration
Wizard, it is a one-way, one-time occurrence and takes place at the time the
customer selects 'send.'

The June 5 Information Week has a big product review story about network-
distributed PC management products which using software on PC's and on
servers to let administrators inventory PC contents, update PC files,
distribute software, monitor usage, and so-on and so-forth.  Two of the
products, including most notably Microsoft's SMS, will put any PC into
promiscuous mode to sniff packets from the LAN's to which it may be attached
and forward the data to another machine for analysis.
<P>
I feel disappointed that the story doesn't even mention the possibility that
these products may pose security risks.  Three such occur to me instantly:
that people can place bad data onto PC's using the distribution facilities;
that people can retrieve confidential data from PC's using the inspection
and monitoring facilities; and that people can steal confidential data from
the network using the remote packet sniffing facilities.  I'm sure there are
many more problems.  Not only does the story ignore risks, but consequently
it does not mention or rate any product features which might mitigate such
risks (e.g., schemes by which PC's could authenticate purported management
server commands before responding to them).
<P>
Doesn't anyone out there in the software business give a hoot about these
issues?

Malcolm Vincent from a UK email address writes:<BR>
&gt; [...] but I do have an account on a FreeNet site in the US which for<BR>
&gt; the moment will remain nameless. Now really, what is to prevent me<BR>
&gt; downloading nautilus to my free-net and from thence to home.
<P>
It may not even be necessary to have a US based account.  The mechanism
used is to do a DNS name lookup on your IP number.  However there are
plenty of non-US sites with DNS names which look American (end in .com for
instance).  Some of the sites have weaker checks, merely requiring you to
agree by virtue of downloading that you are a US citizen.
<P>
There are plenty of routes whereby crypto software can leave the US with
very low risk of detection.  Consider, for instance, that the software
could be encrypted with PGP, and mailed through a chain of encrypting
anonymous remailers.  In fact something of this nature must already have
happened for it is available for ftp in the UK from Oxford University:
<P>
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.ox.ac.uk/pub/crypto/misc/nautilus-0.9.0.tar.gz">ftp://ftp.ox.ac.uk/pub/crypto/misc/nautilus-0.9.0.tar.gz</A>
<P>
Also, ITAR only clearly holds if you are a US citizen, currently living in
the US.  I don't believe this situation (ftp from outside the US of US
export controlled software) has ever been explored in court, but it is not
immediately obvious that a US law which makes an action illegal in the US
could be held to apply outside the US.  Particularly as the physical
jurisdiction in question does not have a similar law.
<P>
The whole question rests on the legal interpretation of the action of ftping
a file, which jurisdiction is ftp initiator considered to be in.  A
non-computer based example which could be used as a metaphor: obtaining
information from a foreigner on the phone.  Say that a US citizen had made a
phone call to the former Soviet Union and had requested KGB classified
information, information which was freely available in the US, would the US
person have committed an offense on Russian soil and hence expect to be
extradited?  The telephone example is very similar to the modern
computerised example, ftp is merely an automated information retrieval
system.
<P>
Another somewhat related risk, is people outside the US posting crypto code
to USENET, for instance my sig file below implements RSA encryption in 3
lines of perl.  If you are not familiar with encryption schemes, RSA is one
of the most secure public key encryption schemes, and is the one used in
PGP.  It is also very firmly on the ITAR export control list.
<P>
Information on the sig is at:
<P>
<A HREF="http://dcs.ex.ac.uk/~aba/rsa/">http://dcs.ex.ac.uk/~aba/rsa/</A>
<P>
Some US folks are printing a T-shirt with this code on it, in honour of
ITAR, to produce an export controlled "munitions" T-shirt.  Also on the web
page is postscript for a 1x4" mailing label with the code as handed out by
New York lawyer Duncan Frissell at Computers, Freedom and Privacy '95 - for
an export-controlled mailing label.  A picture of one of these labels was
printed on the front page of the business section of the New York Times
(April 10th).
<P>
[As I recall, the left margins were (intentionally?) fuzzied.  PGN]
<P>
In using this sig, there is the risk that news distribution paths cross the
US borders a few times on the way, does this constitute "export"?  What
about a mailing list, members will receive copies via the US list server.
Some unsuspecting US usenet reader might quote the sig by accident.
<P>
Living in the UK, I feel fairly confident of the safety, and legality of
using my sig, but what about larger programs posted by those outside the US.
I mean if a non-US citizen living outside the US were to fetch nautilus from
the Oxford ftp site and post it (speaking hypothetically here of course)
uuencoded to sci.crypt, would that person be in trouble?  I am not sure that
this would be a good idea, but it is an interesting question from a legal
point of view.  But the perl rsa implementation is okay at 3 lines?  The
question arises about where the cut off point is: 10 lines, 1000?

This reminds me of something a colleague told me a few years ago, when her
employer first installed voice mail.  Mysteriously, the system would often
prevent her from leaving messages.  After the beep, she would start leaving
a message, and then at some point (usually near when she was almost
finished) it would cut her off, saying "That is not a valid code, please
re-enter your message", for no apparent reason.  Naturally, this drove her
up the wall.  It did not behave this way for anyone else.
<P>
It turns out that since her voice is pitched relatively high, the voice mail
system mistook her voice for one of the phone number tones.  I guess it
wasn't zero or one, or she would have gotten further instructions.  Last I
heard, she started leaving messages with her best James Earl
Jones-impression, and that worked.  I don't know if the problem was ever
fixed.  Again, the RISK is assuming certain things about the human voice.

This talk about positive and negative ions is really nothing new.  If you go
through the literature, especially the medical literature of the 60's and
70's on the subject, early research suggested (perhaps empirically in some
cases) that negatively ionized environment promote health, accelerated
healing, and an overall sense of well being.
<P>
I have had negative ion generators at home for years, but never too near
computers because `crashes' became too common.  In the late 70's and early
80's, companies were attempting to market humongous negative ion generators
for use in the air conditioning systems of new buildings to neutralize the
`positive ion effects of computer equipment.'
<P>
I've not yet seen a study of whether wholesale ionization of air-conditioned
buildings with no ventilation is a justified investment or not; some have
claimed that increased worker productivity and fewer sick days were an
immediate benefit.
<P>
But that assumes the computers still work.
<P>
I'd like to see more of the recent work on the subject, as my file
cabinets full of these files are `antique' - more than 15 years old.

A NYC subway train on the Williamsburg Bridge crashed into the rear end of
another train on 5 June 1995.  The motorman apparently ran through a red
light, and was still applying power at the time of the crash.  The safety
system is supposed to apply emergency brakes whenever a train runs a red
light, but it seems that did not happen.  (Subway officials said they had
never seen that failure mode before.)  So, we must add to the RISKS annals
yet another case in which human error and system failure acted in
combination.  Here, neither of the two sets of safety measures was able to
rely on the other.  [Source: various news services on 6 and 7 June 1995.]

is being considered by the IRS.  (Czubinski was also described as a sometime
political candidate and a member of the Ku Klux Klan.)

I just learned yesterday that the Internet is a dangerous place.  It seems
someone up in Canada posted a message about a bomb and made it look like I
wrote the message.  Well, guess what happened, I got a visit from the U.S.
Secret Service.  It seems that they don't quite understand the Internet and
think that, just because my name and E-mail address appeared in the text of
the document, I wrote it.
<P>
If anyone knows of any `bomb' files that have my name on them, would you
please tell me what archive they are stored at, because I didn't write them
and I want my name off them?

<P>
In a recent issue of the TELECOM digest, it was reported that Ameritech now
allows anyone to obtain bill payment information for any Ameritech line
(unless blocked by specific subscriber request)--a true bonanza for snoops<BR>
in general and for folks trolling for big bill customers to target for
marketing.
<P>
Obviously, this is a terrible policy.  It is unfortunately not a unique
situation.  Ameritech's explanation (as reported in TELECOM) has been
spouted by numerous other utilities, banks, and other entities.  If a
subscriber complains, they are frequently told that "hardly anyone else has
complained about the system".  If 1000 people complain, they may each
individually be told that they're essentially the "lone wolf".
<P>
The "solution" is obvious.  Ameritech should return to a "random" passcode
system, and allow customers who have a problem remembering the code to
either choose something simple ("0000") or opt for no code at all.  But such
a choice of no security should be made by the individual customer--to make
it the default condition for all customers is very bad policy.
<P>
Experience has shown that the only effective way to deal with these types of
situations is to complain loudly to the highest level you can reach.  In the
case of Ameritech, complaints (and suggestions for "fixing" the problem, as
mentioned above) should be made to the billing supervisor level at
least--better yet, speak to the managers.  And while it means taking the
time to put it down in written form, letters to state PUCs are *extremely*
important with such matters.
<P>
I'm sure there are just a *few* Ameritech subscribers reading this now.  If
each of you expressed your opinion (one way or another) to the PUC and
Ameritech regarding their system, I suspect you could have considerable
impact.

*California Lawyer*, June 1995 is a "High Tech" issue that RISKS readers
might find moderately interesting, if for no other reason than to see
another view of the computer field. Here's a brief summary of the contents:
<UL>
<LI>An article on how software games developer Electronic Arts learned
about Hollywood dealmaking.
<LI>An article on the First Amendment and the Internet.
<LI>How a midsize law firm incorporated computers into its "culture."
<LI>Cybercrime "police worry about savvy criminals."
<LI>A map of Silicon Valley with law firms identified.
<LI>Worries about digital piracy (copying laser disks, copying documents).
<LI>A lawyer's viewpoint of the Intel Pentium problem.
<LI>Repetitive-motion injury problems.
<LI>Techno Tools.
</UL>
Readers may also find the proliferation of computer-based legal tools
interesting: as usual the advertisements are often more fascinating than
the articles.
<P>
A few random quotes:
<P>
Electronic Arts: ``Securing the rights [to rock music] took almost as
long as producing the game.''
<P>
Hate speech: ``The first time you get a first-run film sent over the
Internet, you'll get lots of lawyers involved." "The First Amendment allows
hate speech [on the Internet] to persist.''
<P>
Cybercrimes: ``For the most part, the computer has not introduced any new
types of crimes, but it has introduced new methods, time frames, and
languages for committing theft, manipulation, destruction, and espionage.''
<P>
Digital Piracy: ``Today's ability to create perfect copies over the Internet
has frightened people.''
<P>
Intel: Disclosing bugs gains advantage in public-relations, but that doesn't
take into account the business ramifications, including product replacement,
numbers of customers, .... ``Legal ramifications are often secondary to
corporate concerns.''  ``The Intel case study offers more public-relations
lessons than legal ones, attorneys agree.''  ``The legal effect ... is about
nil, Vendors have protected themselves with so many warranty clauses ...
that they can get away with anything.''
<P>
From California Lawyer, June 1995. 1390 Market St., Ste 1210,
San Francisco, CA 94102. (415) 252-0500. The issue may be difficult
to find, as I obtained the last one available at my doctor's office.

<P>
INTERNET COPYRIGHT FEARS
<P>
Internet users could be breaking the law every time they transfer a file
from the global computer network to their own computer, said Ross Johnston,
a copyright lawyer of Kensington Swan, speaking at a seminar in Wellington.
He said that as well as printing copies or storing them on a computer disk,
simply browsing articles on the Internet using a computer screen could be
infringing the law.  He described the World Wide Web part of the Internet as
a giant copying machine.
<P>
New Zealand's Copyright Act defines copying to include "storing the work in
any medium by any means". When a computer user browses information on the
Internet, an electronic copy is temporarily created in the computer's
memory.  Mr Johnston said a copy did not have to be permanent.
<P>
Copyright specialist Ken Moon, of A.J.Park &amp; Son, in Auckland, echoed this
view: "I believe that transient copying is an infringement," he said.

The accident that caused the death of two technicians was not exactly
"failure of the main cryogenic motor".
<P>
I excerpt from the ESA press release:
<UL>
<LI>The accident happened on May 5 in the Ariane 5 launch area at the<BR>
Guiana Space Centre.
<P>
<LI>The cause of death was asphyxiation through inhalation of air having<BR>
an excessively low oxygen contents.
<P>
<LI>The reduced oxygen contents was due to a major nitrogen leak into the<BR>
confined structure of the umbilical mast on the launch table.
<P>
<LI>The nitrogen leak originated in a nitrogen/iced water exchanger,<BR>
whose drainage plug was found to be missing.
</UL>
I have not seen any announcement of a delay of tests, so I cannot comment on
whether, and how, that may be related to the mentioned accident.

In <A HREF="/Risks/17.15.html">RISKS-17.15</A>, Daniel Frankowski comments on the moronic thrill-piece
"Cyberstoned", Originally from Boston Magazine, and reprinted in the<BR>
Minneapolis Star Tribune. I too noticed this offensive piece of fluff, and
sent the following letter to the editor:
<P>
To the Editor:
<P>
"Cyberstoned", in Monday's opinion section is just the latest attempt to<BR>
demonize the Internet for all of Mankind's pre-existent woes. In the last
couple of months, people with no great liking or understanding of the net
have cited such spectres as kiddie porn, drug dealing, and even the Oklahoma
bombing as compelling reasons to dramatically limit the operation of the
net, often in a ham-handed manner. Senator James Exon's (D-NE) recently
defunct "Digital Decency Act" would have required all Internet providers to
read and censor each of millions of messages a day.
<P>
Early denizens of the Internet created a benign anarchy, where free speech
was it's own best remedy. Ironically, pressure to change the net comes from
newcomers, who bought a modem specifically because they heard that there was
something new happening on the net. This dynamic reminds me of the process
of gentrification, where artists and other fringes types will reclaim urban
wasteland. Once the quality of the neighborhood improves, more genteel types
move in, and systematically erase all signs of bohemia. Our response to the
possibilities offered by the net should not be the neanderthal reflex of
killing it because we don't understand it.

<P>
I do recommend reading the Citicorp article. The scary part is that this
problems were only uncovered by accident. Also, while the idea of a 1 in 700
year event is considered far-fetched, the midwest floods, which partially
recurred this year, Mt St Helen's and imply that somewhere, a very unlikely
event will occur. And then there's the World Trade Center.
<P>
The John Hancock building in Boston, AKA The Plywood Palace, is another
example. It got that nickname because its windows were falling out and had to
be replaced with plywood. Eventually the problem was solved by simply making
the glass a little thicker.
<P>
But the problems caused some additional attention to be paid to the building
including further wind tunnel testing. The building is a flat rectangle
(almost) and designers assured it wouldn't fall over on its short side. The<BR>
surprise was that the building was in danger of collapsing on its long axis!
Considering the height, it does make sense that the center of gravity can go
far out of alignment, at least, in hindsight. The solution was to be put an
active damping system at the top -- pioneered in the Citicorp building. The
Citicorp article noted that the damping provides stability but not safety
since the power supply is a point of vulnerability.
<P>
The main lesson is that despite all the writing in this forum about proper
procedures, things will go wrong. The question is not so much how to prevent
problems but how to respond and recover. Prevention is only an optimization
of this process and shouldn't overwhelm the process. A full discussion of
this topic is a large topic in its own right, but I'll limit my self to
riling the audience in this missive.
<P>
As a PS, there was an article in the Sunday New York Times (May 29th) about
lawyers descending upon Norplant, a long term contraceptive. The article
noted that these are the same lawyers who got rich on Silicone (not to be
confused with Silicon!) implants. While the Citicorp article emphasized the
exemplary behavior of all those involved, reality, if anything, is becoming
more problematic. Responsible behavior is often severely punished. If you
take any responsibility, you might be liable for punitive damages. It is
better not to investigate an area at all, than to learn of a problem and
calculate the tradeoffs of dealing with it. Again, this is another topic
which would take too much space to fully address in a short not. I've also
got to add that I'm not a lawyer and probably don't look much like one either.

Don Faatz relates that his boss regularly gets E-mail at his Compuserve
account that is destined for somebody else whose account differs by only
digit.
<P>
This is another case of a namespace not being sparse enough.  It is too
simple to hit another real Compuserve address by hitting one wrong number.
The risk could be reduced with checksum digits like those used for ISBN and
credit card numbers. Other small-namespace culprits include the telephone
system (especially when used by semi-automated systems like faxes) and some
computer languages (changing a random piece of punctuation in a C program
has a chance of resulting in a different, valid program. APL is probably
much worse.)

To make matters worse, he probably has to pay for the incorrectly sent mail

<P>
Here in Europe we have had central Air Traffic Control for a couple of
months. A few weeks back , I was on a flight from Preveza (Western Mainland
Greece to London Gatwick). First the flight was delayed by an autopilot that
refused to permit the flight from London earlier in the day from climbing
above 10000 feet (something to do with fuel load trimming), so they had to
turn back, and change the 757 for a Lockheed L1011 (impressive landing on
short runway - almost aircraft carrier performance, as the runway wasn't
really long enough).
<P>
Then we sat in the L1011 and waited while the crew tried to:
<P>
Contact Athens ATC - couldn't give a slot to take off, as Brussels was
uncontactable.<BR>
Contact Brussels Central ATC direct  by phone - no answer.<BR>
Contact London , and get their airline headquarters to phone Brussels - no
answer.
<P>
So we sat for 3 hours until the crew nearly ran out of hours in charge of the
plane, until Brussels ATC  came back on line.
<P>
Question : What happens if the ATC goes off-line while you are in the air ?
How does the system fall back ? Does it go off-line regularly ?

Rob Horn's article in <A HREF="/Risks/17.16.html">RISKS-17.16</A> misuses the concept of `field'.  Horn was
talking about commutative rings with unit. The standard definition of
`field' trivially entails that a division operation is available. The<BR>
integers don't form a field.  However, the integers modulo p, for p a prime
number, under addition and multiplication, do.
<P>
Fields have been studied in mathematics for a long time, well over a
century. The standard terminology is at least a half-century old.  The
definition is given in the following widely available texts:
B. van de Waerden, Algebra, a standard reference for a half century
and still in print (the oldest reference I could find today is to the
3rd edition in 1950; see p39 of the Springer German edition); S. Lang,<BR>
Algebra (3rd edition p93); S. Maclane and G. Birkhoff, Modern Algebra

Sorry, you're right.  Somewhere along the years I did a mental slip.  I
should have been using the term commutative ring.  I've probably left behind
a few years of confused people.  Actually computer integers are suffer
further in that they are not actually a ring either, because there is a
maximum value beyond which addition or multiplication fail.

Periodically I remind you of TWO useful digests related to privacy, both of
which are siphoning off some of the material that would otherwise appear in
RISKS, but which should be read by those of you vitally interested in
privacy problems.  RISKS will continue to carry general discussions in which
risks to privacy are a concern.
<UL>
<LI>The PRIVACY Forum Digest (PFD) is run by Lauren Weinstein.  He manages it as
a rather selectively moderated digest, somewhat akin to RISKS; it spans the
full range of both technological and non-technological privacy-related issues
(with an emphasis on the former).  For information regarding the PRIVACY
Forum, please send the exact line:
<P>
information privacy
<P>
as the BODY of a message to "<A HREF="mailto:privacy-request@vortex.com">privacy-request@vortex.com</A>"; you will receive
a response from an automated listserv system.  To submit contributions,
send to "<A HREF="mailto:privacy@vortex.com">privacy@vortex.com</A>".
<P>
<LI>The Computer PRIVACY Digest (CPD) (formerly the Telecom Privacy digest) is
run by Leonard P. Levine.  It is gatewayed to the USENET newsgroup
comp.society.privacy.  It is a relatively open (i.e., less tightly moderated)
forum, and was established to provide a forum for discussion on the
effect of technology on privacy.  All too often technology is way ahead of
the law and society as it presents us with new devices and applications.
Technology can enhance and detract from privacy.  Submissions should go to
<A HREF="mailto:comp-privacy@uwm.edu">comp-privacy@uwm.edu</A> and administrative requests to
<A HREF="mailto:comp-privacy-request@uwm.edu">comp-privacy-request@uwm.edu</A>.
</UL>
There is clearly much potential for overlap between the two digests, although
contributions tend not to appear in both places.  If you are very short of time
and can scan only one, you might want to try the former.  If you are interested
in ongoing detailed discussions, try the latter.  Otherwise, it may well be
appropriate for you to read both, depending on the strength of your interests
and time available.

For the benefit of the RISKS archives, if nothing else, let me note that the
U.S. Senate voted 84 to 16 yesterday for the Exon amendment to the
telecommunications bill.  Senator Exon's measure imposes fines up to
$100,000 and prison terms up to two years for knowingly transmitting
indecent material over a computer network accessible to minors.  It also
applies to "obscene lewd, lascivious, filthy or indecent" comments,
requests, or suggestions intended to annoy or harass.
<P>
Decidedly in the minority of senators on this issue, Senator Leahy produced
a stack of petitions from some 35,000 people (presumably most of whom used
E-mail) who believe that Exon's measure is a serious threat to
constitutional rights, free speech, and the Internet.

*Aviation Daily* reports in its "Intelligence" section 8 Jun 1995 that an
erroneous command in TCAS (Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance system)
nearly resulted in a midair collision Sunday involving a United 737 and a
Viscount Air Services 737, both on approach.  After both aircraft received a
TCAS warning, the United airplane began to climb from 10,000 feet to 12,000
feet while the Viscount plane started to descend to 10,000 feet.  The
aircraft came within 200 feet of each other before controllers instructed
the Viscount flight to return to 11,000 feet.  The incident occurred in the
``Northwestern portion of the U.S.''

Mike James asked "What happens if the ATC goes off-line while you are in the
air?"  I am an instrument flight instructor, and this is one of the major
points of instrument training.  There are very specific rules about which
routes and altitudes a pilot must use, as well as when s/he can begin the
landing approach to the airport.  Basically, the pilot must follow the
clearance given by ATC, at the altitude to which the aircraft has been
cleared (there are exceptions that enable the aircraft to safely climb for
higher terrain).  The landing approach should begin at the Estimated Time of
Arrival computed from the actual time of departure and the time enroute
specified in the flight plan.
<P>
The primary purpose of the ATC system is to separate aircraft operating
under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR), and the _assumption_ is that ATC knows
the pilot's intentions so they can clear out the necessary airspace.
Clearances are formulated to prevent potential collisions in the event of
widespread communications outages (for example, I was once approaching a
busy airport under IFR and the approach controller accidentally turned off
his transmitter).
<P>
The system is by no means perfect, but there are backup modes in place, and
all operators (pilots and ATC) are trained in their use.  The
human-in-the-loop aspect also makes the system more robust.  Pilots and
controllers know to try to contact each other over many different
frequencies and methods (eg, in the approach control incident above, we used
the local controller's frequency to call someone in the same building.  It
is also common for ATC to have Flight Service, a different agency, contact
aircraft with lost communications over navigational frequencies, private
frequencies, and the like.)  The worst case scenario -- complete outage of
ATC radio communications -- would probably be handled by pilots using
air-to-air communications.  (This is in fact the standard for separation of
IFR traffic in more remote sections of Australia.)

I don't know whether this applies to many variants of "talk", but this hit
me on a SunOS 5.3 box.
<P>
Talk allows direct interaction with another user elsewhere on the network.
Each user types text into a "window" on the screen, and the other user sees
the text appear on the other window on their own screen. The problem is that
when one user breaks the connection, the program also terminates for the
other user.
<P>
In my case, I was just finishing off a line ("bye") and hitting return when
the other user disconnected. "by" had been read by talk, leaving "e\n" to be
read by my shell.
<P>
The RISK, of course, is that users can accidentally invoke potentially
damaging commands by doing this. All I did was run a line editor, but
supposing I'd been giving advice: "whatever you do, don't type [exit] rm -rf
$HOME"...

Ward Anderson at ACTC just reported an interesting crash on Multics (10.2)
at ACTC -- Collection 1 initialization discovered that I became 45 years old
Tuesday past, an event which was extremely unlikely, and crashed the system
before the clock did damage to the file system, or so it feared.
<P>
The code in scs_and_clock_init is perfectly clear - the time "06/06/95 18:31
est Tuesday" is hard-coded in, in characters, with the comment that it is
"Bernard S. Greenberg's 45th birthday".  It has been there for twenty years
in plain text visible to anyone reading the code!  (I loved to read code in
my day, especially initialization - perhaps I was the last?)
<P>
Maybe Tom Van Vleck remembers, but it is extremely likely that twenty years
ago at CISL our operator at the time for the nth and last time forgot to set
the clock, or set it poorly, and damaged the file system (which looks quite
askance on "back to the future" jaunts), and Tom and I said "This has to
end.  We have to put a gullibility check in the clock init code", and I did
this.  Probably saved a lot of file system damage over the years.  If I had
it to do over again, I'd do it over again!  This code did the -right-thing-!
<P>
At 25, I could not imagine I'd ever be 45, let alone that
scs_and_clock_init.pl1 would be there along with me!  Somehow, though, 65
doesn't seem that far away any more...
<P>
As Ward said, this is a -real- Multics story.

Ivars Peterson is a fine writer who is well-known for his articles in
_Science News_ on physics, math, and computers.  His fourth book (``Fatal
Defect ...'') is a wonderfully readable work that threads its way gently
through some computer-system problems that will be familiar to those of you
who are old-time RISKS readers.  Peterson does this with a fresh view of the
problems and their origins, so that the book is worth reading by everyone --
experienced and novice, young and old, technologists and nontechnologists,
optimists and pessimists.  Peterson also brings to life many of the people
behind the scenes, some of whom are quite familiar to RISKS readers.

Original-Subject: Unlawful arrest based on computer error does not lead to
exclusion of evidence
<P>
&lt;From: Curt Karnow [Landels, Ripley &amp; Diamond] &lt;<A HREF="mailto:karnow@cup.portal.com">karnow@cup.portal.com</A>&gt;
<P>
The United States Supreme Court in Arizona v. Evans (March 1, 1995)
discussed an illegal arrest precipitated by a "computer error." A man was
arrested based on what police officers thought was an outstanding warrant
for his arrest; in fact the warrant had been quashed; court clerical
personnel had failed to clear the warrant from their computer system.  The
police thus had no legal basis for the arrest.
<P>
Following the arrest, the police found a bag of marijuana.  The issue was
whether the marijuana evidence should be suppressed (which would have the
effect of dismissing the case). The state court threw out the evidence under
the old suppression rule -- holding that the "fruit" (drugs) of the
poisonous tree (the illegal arrest) should not come into evidence.  The U.S.
Supreme Court reversed, and held that the purpose of the exclusionary rule
-- to encourage proper police procedures -- would not be furthered by
tossing the evidence.
<P>
The Supreme Court found that excluding the evidence would not have a
significant effect on the actions of court personal, and thus that errors by
court clerks were not a basis for excluding evidence.  The Court did not
address whether court personnel's outright misconduct, and such personnel's
deliberate efforts to violate peoples' constitutional rights, would lead to
the exclusion of evidence, but the reasoning in this case strongly suggests
that such misconduct would *not* lead to exclusion.

A Clarinet brief, <I>newsbriefUR992_5u6@clarinet.com</I>, if
you have Clarinet, stated that a group of people would like to "bring
the thrill of casino gambling to the Internet."
<P>
There are clearly many risks to this.  First, there is no way to
verify that the person gambling is who they say they are.  That is, I can
easily steal someone's credit card and spend money at a digital casino
without them knowing.  Of course, if I win, the other person might be happy
if their credit card is credited, but chances are, I will lose their money.
<P>
Second, there is no way to verify the age of the player.  There are
already problems with minors gambling in real casinos and there will
certainly be a problem with minors gambling in virtual ones.
<P>
Third, there is absolutely no way to tell if the house is cheating
or not.  At least in a real casino, there are video tapes of the dealer or
operator and independent auditors.  I am curious who the digital gambling
houses will hire to audit their systems.
<P>
Fourth, what happens when bugs are discovered in the code?  This can
cut both ways: the computer might give away too much money, or the computer
could never let anyone win.
<P>
The brief on Clarinet said the Justice Dept. said gambling via the
Internet may break many laws.  However, even if it doesn't, I think people
would really be taking a big risk by gambling on the Internet.  (Of course,
that is really the point of gambling anyway, isn't it?)

[1st, crypto-based authentication technology is progressing,
but will never be completely foolproof.  2nd, NO WAY is perhaps
too strong.  3rd, NO WAY, perhaps; you could have bonded/trusted
third-parties -- although the casinos would object.  4th, bugs?

<P>
In <A HREF="/Risks/17.17.html">RISKS-17.17</A>, I worried out loud about the broader possible implications
of the recent ruling against Prodigy.
<P>
My concern was, and remains, that by viewing Prodigy as a newspaper because
it exerts =some= editorial control, the courts failed to make distinctions
both of degree and technology. Like the moderator of this forum, I worried
about forums which may be edited (by post rejection) to increase signal
noise ratios, or to eliminate off topic posts. Such forums, could, if the
Prodigy ruling reflects a lack of discernment by the courts, be forced to
discontinue or begin much more controlled editing. I found this somewhat
incredible, since it meant that the ruling could well lead to more
censorship, and worse, less forums.
<P>
To my surprise, my mailbox began filling with mail from individuals quite
happy about the ruling, most specifically, happy about any discomfort to
Prodigy. Now, I am neither a friend to censorship nor to Prodigy, but I
found the enmity towards this private business puzzling. After all, anyone
is free to subscribe or not subscribe. While I oppose censorship, I also
oppose interfering with what private businesses offer to their customers.
Since, to my knowledge, Prodigy never guaranteed that the facts in any post
appearing on their system were true, to hold them liable is to force them to
do something for their customers that was not in the contract voluntarily
agreed to by both Prodigy and its subscribers.
<P>
The RISK I am perceiving is this: the popular net bias against filters,
censors, and restricted info access, (however justifiable) has created such
hatred against Prodigy, which appears to be practicing the most control of
any provider (though still nothing like a newspaper) has people cheering
over its loss in the courts despite the fact that the ruling holds grave
risks to the internet and its culture as a whole.

Here is a prime example of the idiocy (IMHO) of non-technically
oriented lawyers expounding on copyright infringement on the internet...
these are the same people that say, technically, you need two legal copies
of any form of software, because it is read off the disk into memory, so you
have two copies at once. Both lead to situations where the law is completely
unenforceable.
<P>
Given the growing popularity of the Web as a internetworking
paradigm, the only way to avoid your copyrights being violated is to keep
your material off the Web...a dandy way to ensure that a significantly
smaller audience (market?) has anything to do with your work.
<P>
Carried to it's logical, if utterly absurd conclusion, reading
anything is a copyright violation, because we certainly store significant
quantities of the information in our brains.
<P>
When a user browses ANY sort of information on a computer, a
temporary copy is made, even if only in a screen buffer.
<P>
When opinions like this get floated about, unfortunately, the
real issues of maintaining copyright protections in a distributed network
environment like the Web get buried in the silly stuff, which in the

Similar thinking allegedly prevails in the committee appointed to
study copyright law under US Vice President Al Gore's "Reinvention of
Government" program, as reported in the April, 1995 issue of SCIENTIFIC
AMERICAN.
Literal interpretation of the New Zealand Act's language as quoted
above would prevent many uses in the classroom as well as boardroom. A
simple overhead projector would produce a "transient" copy on the silvery
screen, to name one instance.
One may presume that "fair use" or a general license for educational
purposes would allow the overhead projector use, but how does this differ
from using a web browser to allow all of the audience to view the same
document? Quibbling with the definition of "medium," I could argue that the
virtual images created by eyeglasses constitute a copy. Should we wish to
pursue the matter ad absurdum, an image of the material is stored in the
colloidal medium of the viewer's central nervous system, though this may be
considered an abstract only, at least given this RISKS reader's memory.
The RISK is of course making sweeping provisions in law that at the
time of legislation seem to encompass very little, while human innovation
tiles those sparsely-settled plains more quickly with each passing year.

I've seen and heard a number of "warnings" of this sort.  They strike me as
belonging in the same category as Chicken Little's concern that the sky is
falling, for two reasons.
<P>
First, the fact that someone who owns the rights to a piece has published it
to the World Wide Web can be construed as permission to make a transient
copy for the purpose of viewing and/or listening to the piece.  Someone who
wishes to prevent others from keeping more persistent copies of such works
should protect the relevant rights by causing a statement of reservation of
rights to be presented alongside the works to be protected.
<P>
Second, the people who own the copyrights and the people who make the laws
that govern them (a) are not all idiots and (b) do talk to each other.  The
problem on this level is easy to fix.  There are much more difficult
problems concerning intellectual property on the Web and the Internet.
Let's not spend too much effort worrying about the trivial ones.  --

Any medium/any means?  How about if the work is memorized?

The Western Institute of Computer Science announces a Practical Week-long
Course for Consultants, Educators, Government and Industry Scientists and
Engineers on INTERNET SECURITY, at Stanford University July 24-28, 1995.
<P>
This course is taught by leading researchers and practitioners in the area
of internet security: Arthur M. Keller, Dave Crocker, Tina M. Darmohray,
Whitfield Diffie, Mark Eichin, Gail Grant, Lance Hoffman, Sushil Jojodia,
Peter Neumann, Allan M. Schiffman, and William Wong.  Participants will
receive a grounding in internet security, familiarity with current concepts
and issues, and exposure to the most important research and development
trends in the area.
<P>
Connecting to the Internet brings both unparalleled information resources
and unparalleled security dangers.  Protecting computer systems and networks
from attacks is a critical and ongoing process.  Equally important is
protecting corporate intellectual property assets from inappropriate access.
This course will examine a variety of network security topics, including
protecting against intrusion, detecting and tracking intruders, and
repairing damage after intrusion.
<P>
The course will begin with a survey of basic security concepts, followed by
a detailed description of cryptography.  We will then cover Internet
security architecture and identification and authentication.  The course
will then cover specific security technologies.  These include network
firewalls, which provide perimeter security, intrusion detection systems,
Kerberos and addition of security to existing network applications, secure
messaging, secure payments, and World Wide Web security, including Secure
HTTP and SSL.  This course will also analyze security issues for electronic
commerce, such as viruses and cryptographic policy.  We will also show a
videotape presentation on SATAN by Dan Farmer, one of its developers.

RISKS will be more or less off the air from now until July 24.  I will
probably not be able to answer many of your queries and requests during that
period even when I am on-line.  Continuations of recent ongoing discussions
are likely to cease as of this issue.  However, please send in all
interesting NEW items that you encounter.
<P>
For our 10th anniversary RISKS issue on 1 August 1995, I would be very happy
if a few of you would submit (by 24 July) concise and well-reasoned
think-pieces on what we might have learned in the past 10 years, with
respect to some aspect of the RISKS experience.  Have things improved?  Or
are we collectively treading water -- or being washed out to sea?  What is
missing?  Are the real problems technological or otherwise?  (The best
reflective contributions might even wind up as Inside Risks columns in the
CACM!)
<P>
I hope you all have a pleasant summer.

That was the headline on a piece in *The Times* (London) on 15 June 1995
about a Barclays Bank computer system that deals with loans and mortgages to
bank staff.  It was running a new accounting system, and it refused to
generate monthly repayments for more than 100 staff named Fiona.  Nobody
else was affected, including a Ffyona.  Numerous Fionas were sufficiently
honest to contact the bank and ask why their repayments hadn't been
deducted.  It isn't clear how long the lucky Fionas would have had their
repayment holidays if some of them hadn't owned up.  The bank is adamant no
hacking was involved.  A spokeswoman blamed `a blip' and added, `Our systems
people say that they knew how to solve the problem even if they could not
explain what precisely had caused it.'

The Royal Majesty is the cruise ship that ran aground off Nantucket. There
is a good article in *The Boston Globe* 19 Jun 1995 by David L Chandler
entitled "Embarrassing lessons for navigators". It is a good "risks style"
article that covers various issues including the question of whether the GPS
system indeed failed and was 17 miles off. It discusses issues of the user
interface -- is navigation information presented in such a way as to
actually be usable during hectic periods?  It brings up question of whether
it is safe to turn off Loran, the Valdez accident, and other pertinent
issues.
<P>
Nothing particularly new for Risks readers, but it is worthwhile to note
reasonable articles in the newspapers.

As reported in the June 16 New York Times, further investigation of the 5
Jun 1995 NY subway crash (which killed the motorman and injured 54 people)
indicates the distance between signals is shorter than the stopping distance
of a modern train.  Speculation right after the accident had focused on a
possible emergency brake failure.  However, even with the brake engaged,
tests showed it takes approximately 360ft for the train to stop.
Unfortunately, the rear of the forward train was only 288ft from the signal.
It now appears that the motorman ran the red signal, which tripped the
emergency brake and slowed the train from about 32mph (the maximum speed
after climbing the hill leading to the crash area) to 14-18mph at the time
of impact.
<P>
The signal spacing was set in 1918 when trains were shorter, lighter,
and slower than modern trains. The Transit Authority has been upgrading
the trains without upgrading the control system. A familiar RISK.
<P>
The immediate response has been to limit speeds on the section of track
where the accident occurred. When a TA official was asked if speeds will
be reduced in other areas, the official said "we don't know where the
potential trouble spots are." I guess we're just going to wait for more
accidents to find the areas that need fixing. Another familiar RISK.

One of the risks that continues to haunt me from that article (and
apparently others as well since my mother mentioned it to me when we
discussed the article) is this:
<P>
(The people in charge of repairs to the building had installed strain gauges
connected by wire to readouts in the main office.)
<P>
One time, the readings went off the chart, then stopped. This provoked
more bafflement than fear, since it seemed unlikely that a hurricane
raging on Lexington and Fifty-third Street would go otherwise unnoticed at
Forty-sixth and Park. The cause proved to be straightforward enough: When
the instrumentation experts from California installed their strain
gauges, they had neglected to hire union electricians. `Someone heard
about it,' LeMessurier [the building designer] says, `went up there in
the middle of the night, and snipped all the wires.'

I remember once reading a paper with a synopsis something like this:
<P>
This paper is in two parts.
<P>
In Part 1, we prove that it is impossible to play a fair
game of telephone poker.
<P>
In Part 2, we give an algorithm for playing a fair game
of telephone poker.
<P>
The apparent paradox, of course, was that the algorithm in Part 2
was actually unfair with a probability that could be made as small
as desired by making the crypto keys long enough.
<P>
I wish I remember the title or author of the paper.  Anyway, such
things leave me with the distinct impression that Internet gambling
is no less feasible than any other kind of electronic commerce.

It occurred to me that the stories in comp.risks are often sensationalistic
enough to warrant widespread media coverage.  In fact, a good chunk of stuff
posted here is drawn from the media, with commentary added.
<P>
One risk commonly mentioned here is that "the public" or "the media" haven't
got enough understanding of computer risks, and that we're all going to
suffer as a result -- recently there's been discussion of lawyers who don't
understand computers, etc.
<P>
Well --
<P>
Has anyone tried convincing some television producers to add a computer risk
segment to their news programs?  There's easily enough material that's
interesting enough that's already part of their program -- to make it a
proper segment all that would be required is the addition of a brief
editorial highlighting for the public the general nature of the particular
risk.  I think it would be interesting enough to sell (but then as a regular
reader of comp.risks I'm biased :)
<P>
I don't have the background or the experience or the connections or
anything else to try and make something like this actually happen, but
I'm sure that somewhere out there in RISKS land, someone does...
<P>
Imagine the benefits of having computer risks dealt with sensibly on CNN.
Here in Canada the late night news just ran an extensive segment on the
risks of cellular phones and radios interacting with medical equipment, so
it's not like the media is opposed to the idea.  What with all the hype
about the Internet these days, I think there's a major window of

CALL FOR PAPERS<BR>
The Internet Society Symposium on Network and Distributed System Security
<P>
February 22-23, 1996<BR>
San Diego Princess Resort, San Diego, California
<P>
GOAL: The symposium will bring together people who are building hardware
and software to provide network and distributed system security services.
The symposium is intended for those interested in the practical aspects of
network and distributed system security, focusing on actual system design
and implementation, rather than theory.  We hope to foster the exchange of
technical information that will encourage and enable the Internet community
to apply, deploy, and advance the state of available security technology.
Symposium proceedings will be published by the IEEE Computer Society Press.
Topics for the symposium include, but are not limited to, the following:
<UL>
<LI> Design and implementation of communication security services:
authentication, integrity, confidentiality, authorization,
non-repudiation, and availability.
<P>
<LI> Design and implementation of security mechanisms, services, and
APIs to support communication security services, key management
and certification infrastructures, audit, and intrusion detection.
<P>
<LI> Requirements and designs for securing network information resources
and tools -- WorldWide Web (WWW), Gopher, archie, and WAIS.
<P>
<LI> Requirements and designs for systems supporting electronic commerce --
payment services, fee-for-access, EDI, notary -- endorsement,
licensing, bonding, and other forms of assurance.
<P>
<LI> Design and implementation of measures for controlling network
communication -- firewalls, packet filters, application gateways, and
user/host authentication schemes.
<P>
<LI> Requirements and designs for telecommunications security especially
for emerging technologies -- very large systems like the Internet,
high-speed systems like the gigabit testbeds, wireless systems, and
personal communication systems.
<P>
<LI> Special issues and problems in security architecture, such as
interplay between security goals and other goals -- efficiency,
reliability, interoperability, resource sharing, and cost.
<P>
<LI> Integration of security services with system and application security
facilities, and application protocols -- including but not limited to
message handling, file transport, remote file access, directories, time
synchronization, data base management, routing, voice and video
multicast, network management, boot services, and mobile computing.

<P>
I, too, am glad to see that Multics is still used.  It is a system that was
far ahead of its time in many respects.
<P>
In MTS (the Michigan Terminal System), a system contemporaneous with
Multics which is also still in use, we solved the problem of the operators
entering a bad time in a slightly different way.  During initialization,
the system compares the current time with the time in the last billing
record recorded.  If the current time is earlier or too much later (more
than 12 hours, unless the day is Sunday in which case 18 hours is ok) it
complains and asks the operators to confirm that the time is ok.  This has
several advantages: it doesn't use hard-coded dates, it is a more precise
check, and it never makes the system unusable.  Of course this has become
less important as modern machines maintain the time of day even when not
running and the clock rarely needs to be set at all.

Last fall I worked on the 2Market home shopping CD.  This is a CDROM
catalog with pictures of products from many popular mail-order catalogs,
with QuickTime movies of TV commercials, and sound clips of record albums.
<P>
One of the features of 2Market is that items go on sale.  Of course the
sales have to be prepared in advance, and the user will only get it right
if their clock is set.
<P>
Knowing my own habit of living in the year 1904, the Macintosh beginning
of history (for no reason I can really fathom), I convinced the designers
to let me put in a warning that your clock is off.  The warning is placed
in the message box that is normally used to inform the users that items
are on sale.  Any date that is before we shipped the CD, or after (I
think) a year after the CD shipped warns the user to reset their clock.
Shorter times afterwards give the user the number to order the next CD.
<P>
Let's hope they always remember to update the code when they ship new
versions... I'm not with Medior anymore to remind them.

<P>
The following recent news release from the Wireless Institute of Australia
suggests that some people are getting very nervous, following the Prodigy
defamation case in the USA:
<P>
The name of the gateway is just one of those ironic little twists. :-)
<P>
PACKET GATEWAY DEMANDS STAT. DEC. FROM AMATEURS
<P>
The Launceston Institute of TAFE [Technical and Further Education]
in northern Tasmania, which runs an amateur radio packet-to-Internet
gateway known under the acronym of LITGATE, is requiring radio
amateur users to file a statutory declaration with them.
<P>
The relevant wording of the declaration says: "That I agree to take
full personal responsibility for any information or data which is sent
from my station, or from a station operating under my callsign.
<P>
"That I will not hold the Launceston Institute of TAFE responsible for
the content of data received through the LITGATE, whether such data
is of an offensive, improper, illegal or other unacceptable nature."
<P>
Basically, what the Launceston TAFE requires is that radio amateurs
wanting access to LITGATE must say they will accept responsibility
for all messages under their callsign, whether pirated or not, and agree
they will absolve the Launceston TAFE from responsibility for any
material placed on its system.
<P>
Whether such a statutory declaration is legally binding would be a
matter of conjecture. (Thanks to Victorian Division President, Jim
Linton VK3PC, for details on that item).
<P>
[end]
<P>
I hope somebody can convince these people of the stupidity of their
decision, as they clearly don't understand some of the technical
issues. For those not involved in Amateur Radio, we "hams" operate
our own computer network, using our radios as the physical layer.
<P>
In some places, known as "wormholes" or "gateways", operators transport
message over long distances via Internet, replacing the slower chain of
short-range VHF or UHF radio links. The traffic leaves the net again at some
remote point and rejoins the Amateur packet radio network.
<P>
It's important to realise that the wormholes and Internet are merely being
used as a medium for conveying this traffic from one part of the Amateur
packet network to another; the Amateur traffic is effectively "quarantined"
from other Internet traffic because Amateur Radio licence conditions forbid
non-Amateurs (e.g. other Internet users) from conveying message by Amateur
Radio. So, it would be very hard to argue that LIT is a "publisher" of any
Amateur packet radio traffic passing through its gateway.
<P>
I might add that it is a trivial matter to "pirate" another Radio Amateur's
callsign.

<P>
&gt;hatred against Prodigy, which appears to be practicing the most control of<BR>
&gt;any provider (though still nothing like a newspaper) has people cheering<BR>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<BR>
I think the risk is overstated, because (and only because) the underscored<BR>
assertion is contradicted by Prodigy's own words:
<P>
&gt;     "We make no apology for pursuing a value<BR>
&gt;     system that reflects the culture of the<BR>
&gt;     millions of American families we aspire to<BR>
&gt;     serve. Certainly no responsible newspaper<BR>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<BR>
&gt;     does less when it carries the type of<BR>
^^^^^^^^^<BR>
&gt;     advertising it published, the letters it<BR>
&gt;     prints, the degree of nudity and unsupported<BR>
&gt;     gossip its editors tolerate."<BR>
&gt;(Exhibit J.)
<P>
If Prodigy chooses to back off on their editorial control to, say (and the
decision does say), Compuserve's or AOL's level, they won't be liable for
the content they carry.  Until then, they're providing a specific and
valuable -- no irony intended, for any who might think newspapers aren't
valuable -- service, and can be held responsible to the standards of that
service.

<P>
I see your point, and hope you are right that the ruling will not have
the broad effect I fear (though I have already heard it cited in exactly
the manner I have described in a NPR report on another cyber-case)
<P>
However, it is worth noting that your exhibit does not prove that Prodigy
wanted to be a newspaper. It merely shows that Prodigy cited as an
example of controlling content, newspapers. They could have cited
restaurants that control dress codes, that would not have made them a
restaurant. To say, when one is tired, that even horses get tired if you
work them too long, does not make one a horse.
<P>
To say that you have some rights, similar to one entity does not make you
that entitity. This is the kind of square pegs in round hole legal
thinking that I think harms the emerging character of the net.

"Certainly no responsible newspaper does less" in terms of controlling
content -- "the letters it prints" -- says to me that they are *at least* as
responsible as any newspaper.
<P>
It's not just an example, it's an explicitly stated minimum standard.  One
doesn't have to be a prodigy (sorry ;-) to infer liability.
<P>
I do agree with you that "rabid" is on target for too much of the
anti-Prodigy froth.
<P>
I will also say I was wrong to suggest earlier that moderated groups and
lists should be held to that standard.  Only the ones that claim it for
themselves.

The Washington Post on Tuesday, 27 June 1995, tells of an 18-year-old
Cincinnati woman who was electrocuted Friday at a New Carrollton hotel.
Police said that she was barefoot, wet, and standing on wet concrete.  The
door was apparently charged with electricity from a faulty air-conditioning
unit in the wall near the door. An electrical engineer inspected the room.
Police spokesman Sgt. Rick Morris said, ``They found a faulty air
conditioner emitting some sort of electric charge, and the charge was
transcending to the door."  Steiner Oftgard, vice president of VingGuard,
the manufacturer of the door lock, says the system uses only 9 volts, which
is supplied by six 1 1/2-volt batteries.  Anthony G. Marshall, who writes
the ``At Your Risk" column for Hotel and Motel Management magazine, said,
``This has to be right out of 'Believe It or Not'."  The hotel removed all
guests from rooms that open directly outside, pending further investigation.
<P>
I'm sure there are plently of risks to discuss. I don't think this happened
with old-fashioned door locks.  I also can't decide if Sgt. Morris really
said that, or if some "intelligent" software made a substitution.

According to an article by Garry Pierre-Pierre in the July 8, 1995, New York
Times (p.23), two unidentified youths stole a parked 38,000-pound, 40-foot
NYC bus and took it on a six-block joyride, colliding with seven cars and
smashing the bus into a subway station entrance. The bus, which cost the
city $235,000, suffered "extensive damages."
The bus was vulnerable, the article says, because it was parked on
the street in front of the depot in which it was supposed to be parked. In
the article, a Transit Authority spokesman theorizes that the thieves pried
open the bus door and pushed a sequence of buttons necessary to start the
bus; the vehicle needs no ignition key.
"It's not top-secret information," the spokesman is quoted saying
about the ignition code. "It's certainly information that can be obtained
from watching operators start the buses."
As a New York City taxpayer, resident and vulnerable pedestrian, I'm
somewhat concerned when a T.A. spokesman admits that the ignition code is an
open secret. Several questions come to mind. How many city buses use
pushbutton ignition and not a key? To make it easier on drivers, do all the
pushbutton buses use the same code? Are the codes changeable? How often, if
ever, does the T.A. change them? Who decided that buttons were better than
keys? The article notes that the bus was built in 1994 and is among the
newest in the city's fleet. So much for progress.

The new jail in Pittsburgh took 2 and a half years and $147 million to
build, and has been open since early May.  But, there are apparently tons of
problems with the new facility, including:
<OL>
<LI>Dozens of computer terminals that are unusable because, while the data
jacks were connected and wired, nobody bothered to put electrical outlets
in.
<P>
<LI>A computer system to track inmate information is still off-line for two
reasons.  One, the software is from a Canadian company and is not formatted
to the American justice system (whatever that means - AT).  Two, nobody has
been trained on how to use the system.
<P>
<LI>Guards carry an electronic personal alarm.  These alarms are supposed to
send out signals when there is a security problem, but are prone to false
alarms.  [A few weeks ago, one of the personal alarms accidentally went off
and almost every light and audio alarm on the nuclear sub-like control panel
lit up, said Bruce Helt, a guard who is the union vice president.  As a
result, there was no way to locate where the crisis would have been if the
alarm had been a real emergency, he said.]  In another incident with these
alarms, a female guard had to work an entire shift last week without an
alarm because her battery went dead and there were no spares.
<P>
<LI>There was another electrical malfunction which left jail employees
unable to unlock the doors to three pods, leaving one guard isolated with 56
inmates in each pod.  (According to a TV report, the malfunction not only
locked the guards in, but the cells were left _unlocked_!)  The president of
the jail guards' union, John Pastor, said ["Fortunately, there was no type
of altercation.  But if there had been, we couldn't have gotten help to
anybody."]  The malfunction lasted about two hours and knocked out the air
circulation system on half of the second floor.
<P>
<LI> [The ventilation system occasionally shuts off for no apparent reason.]
<P>
<LI>[The fire alarms go off at all hours for no apparent reason.]  (I guess
that means there's a faulty switch somewhere, but they haven't been able to
figure out how to find it.)
<P>
<LI>The employee elevator in the high-rise jail only works sporadically.
<P>
<LI>[In an emergency, guards could use the pod phones to dial 911.  But it
wouldn't do them any good.  The outside lines to each pod have been
disconnected.  In fact, jail officials mistakenly had the phone company
block all but a few phones from being able to place or receive outside
calls] said Allegheny county Director of Criminal Justice Bob Coll.
</OL>
Perhaps the most incredible quote of the entire article was attributed to
James J. Gregg, Jr., the deputy warden for operations.  He said ["Everything
is working as scheduled."]  (Who the hell approved that schedule????- AT)
<P>
The guards' union president attributed some of the problems to political
maneuvering.  He charged that County Commissioners Tom Forester and Pete
Flaherty rushed the new facility into at least partial use two months early
to show they were tough on crime.  Incidentally, they were both defeated in
the Democratic primary.
<P>
I don't think the risks need to be pointed out.  I'm certainly glad I'm
not a guard in this place.  Fortunately, I don't know of any friends or
relatives who are guards there either.  It always makes me shake my head
in wonderment when I see a project finish up like this.  Makes you wonder
who supervises this stuff.

Three Little Digits, One Big Goof; Bell Atlantic Errs in
Telling N.Va. Residents of New Area Code
<P>
By Mike Mills<BR>
Washington Post Staff Writer
<P>
Sorry, wrong number.
<P>
In a gaffe that would give any public relations manager intestinal
trouble, Bell Atlantic Corp. late last week sent notices to 388,000
Northern Virginia homes and businesses, telling them that their 703
area code would soon be changed to 540.
<P>
"Welcome to 540 Country, from Bell Atlantic" read the cheerful
notices, which included little stickers for people to place on
their phones as a helpful reminder of the impending change.
<P>
The problem is, they told the wrong people.
<P>
It seems the Bell Atlantic staff should have sent the notices to the more
westerly region of VA.  A company spokesperson blamed a programming error for
the $100,000 blunder.  The writer defines the correct area as follows:
<P>
The real boundaries of the new 540 area code stretch from the
southwestern tip of Virginia northeast along both sides of the
Blue Ridge to the Potomac River and east to Fredericksburg.
Prince William County -- which is served by GTE Corp. and did
not receive the mailing -- remains in 703, as do eastern
Loudoun County and Leesburg; western Loudoun County and
Stafford County join Fredericksburg in the new 540 area.
Leesburg also had been originally included, but the map was
modified to exclude the town after many residents complained
that they wanted to remain in the 703 code.
<P>
The article mentions gleefully that Bell Atlantic could have done worse; after
all, AT&amp;T recently used the number of a sex-line instead of its own toll-free
information line.
<P>
[Comment by MK: Another illustration of why quality assurance is needed in
everything.  Also an example of the tendency to blame the I.T. staff:
"programming error" indeed!  I wonder how many people approved this farce
before the mail got out the door?]

The Washington Post Monday business section has a regular "shorts"
called "Digital Flubs", in which they report on interesting goofs.
Many of them appear to be culled (without attribution) from RISKS.
<P>
The June 26 edition reads as follows:
A piece of security software widely used on computer networks has
a hole in it.  [CERT] said it has distributed instructions on how
to correct the problem in FreeBSD, a program created by a software
engineer in the Netherlands.  In some circumstances, the hole lets
people tapping into a computer see and alter information that should
be off-limits to them.  FreeBSD is an "enhancement" to S/Key, a
program that controls password access to networked computers.
S/Key itself does not have the problem.
<P>
I'm not sure what this is actually trying to say, but whatever it is, it's
wrong.  FreeBSD is an operating system, not security software or an
enhancement to S/Key.  FreeBSD wasn't developed by an engineer in the
Netherlands, although it's possible that S/Key was ported to FreeBSD by some
such person.
<P>
The risk is that someone might read this, think it actually describes
a weakness, and mistakenly take action (or not take action) without
knowing that the article is confused.

The 13-year-old daughter of a hospital records clerk in Jacksonville,
Fla., used her mother's computer during an office visit and printed
out names and numbers of patients previously treated in the hospital's
emergency room. According to police, she then telephoned seven people
and falsely told them that they were infected by the HIV virus. One
person attempted suicide after the call. Upon arrest, the girl told
police the calls were just a prank.

<P>
An article by Richard O'Reilly in the business section of the June 28, 1995,
Los Angeles Times describes and evaluates two products intended to help
managers write performance reviews of their employees, Performance Now! from
Knowledge-Point and Employee Appraiser from Austin-Hayne Corp.  Given the
time spent on this task in the typical company, and its (non-)popularity
among managers, I am sure that both products will quickly find a marketplace
niche.  But I am very concerned about the RISKS of hype and legal liability.
<P>
The article describes both products as being expert systems, but to me
they sound more like a collection of canned phrases and paragraphs
with a little bit of software to select them.  Each product asks you
to numerically rate the employee in a number of different categories,
then suggests an evaluation paragraph.  Convenient menu buttons allow
you to "tune" the paragraph by making it slightly more negative or
positive.  Both products allow post-customization of the text.
Performance Now! will also combine some categories into a single
paragraph when they are related.  It also warns you when you give a
negative review, so that you can add supporting material.
<P>
This is bad enough, with its tendency to encourage lazy managers to
give an employee exactly the same review, word for word, in successive
years.  But much more worrisome are the extended features offered by
the two programs.  Performance Now! will combine all the numerical
categories into an overall 1-through-5 rating of the employee, with no
chance for the manager to specify which categories are more important
for that particular job.  This is a classic example of using computers
to dehumanize underlings.  Employee Appraiser skips this feature, but
instead invents evaluations out of whole cloth.  For example,
according to O'Reilly:
<P>
If you choose "generally understands job," the program
proposes an evaluation that says, "You generally understand
the duties and responsibilities of the job.  As a result, you
are often able to act on your own initiative."
<P>
As O'Reilly notes, the manager has not given the program any indication that
the employee has initiative, and the manager must remember to remove this
sentence if it is false.  One can well imagine the glowing review that might
be given Beetle Bailey by this software!
<P>
To be fair to these programs, I am sure that many savvy managers already
have canned paragraphs stored in their word processors to ease the task of
writing reviews.  In that sense, these programs are probably an advance,
because they can integrate multiple factors into their prepackaged writing.
(Besides, one can at least hope that they will use good English!)  But RISKS
readers will be most unhappy about Performance Now!'s attempt to squash all
of this information into a 1-5 numerical rating, and about Employee
Appraiser's tendency to insert things that managers never intended to say.
Especially with the latter, I predict that a wrongful-discharge suit a few
years from now will be quoting a glowing automatically-written performance
review that a manager never intended to be so positive.

From the Associated Press news wire via CompuServe's Executive News Service:
<P>
Pilot-Electronic Mail
<P>
WASHINGTON (AP, 11 July 1195) -- To the embarrassment of the Pentagon, a
detailed account of the June rescue of Capt. Scott O'Grady in Bosnia --
sprinkled with salty language and a dig at the United Nations -- found its
way onto the global Internet computer network.  It was written by Air
Force Capt. Scott Zobrist, an F-16 pilot based with O'Grady at Aviano,
Italy, just hours after O'Grady's rescue by Marines. Zobrist was flying an
F-16 on the periphery of the operation; he listened in on the rescue
team's conversations and tape-recorded them.
<P>
The article explains that Zobrist sent his personal thoughts on the events
to friends, and ZOT! it ended up in wide distribution through AOL.  DoD
officials were embarrassed by Zobrist's language and hostility to the
Bosnian Serb forces.  However, there was apparently no classified
information at all in the document.
<P>
This incident _could_ have happened if Zobrist had sent printed messages to
his friends, but it might have taken longer to spread the photocopies of
photocopies of photocopies to an audience of millions.
<P>
Anyone sending any information that should remain moderately confidential
should include a warning in their message so that the author's intentions
can be clear to all; e.g., "Please do not copy this message to anyone else
and do not post it publicly."  This, too, would not prevent the information
from going out of control, but it might slow down the explosion of copies.
<P>
The following section of the article was particularly interesting:
<P>
A separate question for the Pentagon is whether it can control the
spread of sensitive or embarrassing military information on the
Internet computer network.
<P>
"We need to either control it ourselves or figure out some way to
control it," Brig. Gen. Ron Sconyers told the Detroit Free Press,
which reported on the case in Tuesday's editions. "It's growing
faster than we can keep up with."
<P>
The Internet originated in ARPANET, funded by the Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency 30 years ago.  Maybe the piper wants to start calling the
tune again.

SECOND CALL FOR PAPERS<BR>
Submission deadline is 14 August
<P>
The Internet Society Symposium on
Network and Distributed System Security
<P>
February 22-23, 1996<BR>
San Diego Princess Resort, San Diego, California
<P>
GOAL: The symposium will bring together people who are building hardware
and software to provide network and distributed system security services.
The symposium is intended for those interested in the practical aspects of
network and distributed system security, focusing on actual system design
and implementation, rather than theory.  We hope to foster the exchange of
technical information that will encourage and enable the Internet community
to apply, deploy, and advance the state of available security technology.
Symposium proceedings will be published by the IEEE Computer Society Press.
Topics for the symposium include, but are not limited to, the following:
<UL>
<LI>Design and implementation of communication security services:
authentication, integrity, confidentiality, authorization,
non-repudiation, and availability.
<P>
<LI>Design and implementation of security mechanisms, services, and
APIs to support communication security services, key management
and certification infrastructures, audit, and intrusion detection.
<P>
<LI>Requirements and designs for securing network information resources
and tools -- WorldWide Web (WWW), Gopher, archie, and WAIS.
<P>
<LI>Requirements and designs for systems supporting electronic commerce --
payment services, fee-for-access, EDI, notary -- endorsement,
licensing, bonding, and other forms of assurance.
<P>
<LI>Design and implementation of measures for controlling network
communication -- firewalls, packet filters, application gateways, and
user/host authentication schemes.
<P>
<LI>Requirements and designs for telecommunications security especially
for emerging technologies -- very large systems like the Internet,
high-speed systems like the gigabit testbeds, wireless systems, and
personal communication systems.
<P>
<LI>Special issues and problems in security architecture, such as
interplay between security goals and other goals -- efficiency,
reliability, interoperability, resource sharing, and cost.
<P>
<LI>Integration of security services with system and application security
facilities, and application protocols -- including but not limited to
message handling, file transport, remote file access, directories, time
synchronization, data base management, routing, voice and video
multicast, network management, boot services, and mobile computing.

In suburban Chicago, the main computer used by air-traffic controllers for
the busy midsection of the United States was out of service Monday, for the
third time in a week.  [The good news is that the really archaic backup
system still works, although there is some disagreement over how safe it is.
The main computer system is now 30 years old.]

The control system in Aurora, Illinois, handles almost 10 thousand passing

were burdened by only minor delays.

<P>
Airport Surveillance Radar 9 (ASR9) was supposed to be extremely reliable.
ASR9s operating at Miami International Airport and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood
International Airport have failed a total of 13 times since 24 May 1995 -
six times in the week of 17 July.  (On 20 July, for example, the Fort
Lauderdale ASR9 was down nearly five hours, following a lightning storm.)
ASR9s have also failed at others of the 101 airports where it has been
deployed.
<P>
While the Federal Aviation Administration maintains that passenger safety is
not compromised, the agency now acknowledges that it no longer considers
ASR9 nearly as reliable as it once did. Jerry Taylor, FAA radar program
manager, said Friday his agency now rates ASR9 reliable only 99.35 percent
of the time (instead of the originally advertised 99.99 percent).
[That is .65 unreliability instead of .01, off by a factor of 65.]
<P>
Although the antenna may be operating, a break in a telephone line could
prevent a radar screen from displaying data essential for tracking planes.
<P>
Down time is a significant issue in the Miami-Fort Lauderdale area because
the twin ASR9 radars rely on each other for backup.  When Miami fails,
controllers switch to Fort Lauderdale and vice versa.  Were the two systems
to fail simultaneously (they haven't yet), they could put aircraft at risk.
(There is no third backup.)
<P>
The Cleveland Plain Dealer, which exposed ASR9 problems in articles in
late 1993, said the Huntsville ASR9 sustained 42 outages between January
1990 and December 1993, totaling 130 hours of down time.
<P>
The worst string of outages, the newspaper said, occurred at the
Tri-Cities Airport in Pasco, Wash., where the ASR9 had been down a total of
3,545 hours or an average of 1,181 hours or 49 days a year.
<P>
Airport after airport was listed by the Plain Dealer as showing outages,
glitches or failures. Glitches included phantom planes, real planes that
vanished from screens and frequent outages.
<P>
Separately, in June 1992, Aviation Daily reported major ASR9 snafus at the
St.  Louis Lambert Airport.
<P>
And Friday, The Tampa Tribune reported that Tampa's ASR9 is also
glitch-ridden because it has a tendency to miss storms.
<P>
In some cases, problems have been traced to software glitches or to
lightning like the Fort Lauderdale case Thursday. John Dunkerly, president
of the Harrisburg, Pa., chapter of the National Air Traffic Controllers
Association, told the Plain Dealer it was his view the ASR9 "was vulnerable
to lightning."  Officials in Cleveland and Detroit also expressed the same
complaint.

<P>
[A side box notes that a modification ``adds a computer chip to the radar
computer to prevent the system from receiving `erroneous messages'.''
(Hopefully, this won't result in ignoring ERROR messages!)  In general,
this case seems to have many risky elements - backups dependent on one
another, system dependencies on sub-systems (e.g. phone, power lines)
that may not be as reliable or fail-safe as the radar product itself,
and the fact that the ``caretakers'' of the system (FAA) may not be taking
a ``total customer satisfaction'' approach to solving the system's problems.]

"They take turns sleeping, don't they?" I asked.

"Sometimes they just turn the autopilot on.  It rings an alarm before
course corrections during the flight, so they can wake up and make that it

"But what if the autopilot screws up while they are asleep?"
<P>
"How could that happen?  They have _five_ computers on board!"

This filled me with confidence to know that the sheer number of computers

Bad cop abuses access to personal computer data
<P>
"If we, just by fluke at guessing the dates to check,
found three records called up in an unauthorized manner,
just how much more is there?  It's very scary."<BR>
--- Kim Zander, "Every Woman's Health Centre"
(an abortion clinic in Vancouver, BC)
<P>
In August, 1994, several clinic staff received phone calls or mail
from anti-abortion activists.  They found this rather unsettling,
because they'd made a point of trying to keep personal information
like address or telephone numbers private.
<P>
This concern led them to the police, to whom they explained that
anti-abortion activists were recording license plate numbers outside
the clinic and apparently using them to track down personal information
... but the police didn't seem to do much.
<P>
In September, 1994, Gordon Watson, a prominent local anti-abortion activist,
stated while on the stand in a court hearing that he had gathered license
plate numbers in order to "follow up on them" and he "paid good money"
to get personal information about the car owners.  When clinic staff
asked the Crown council and police to investigate, they were told,
"Give us two weeks."
<P>
After two months of hearing nothing, the women filed a
freedom-of-information request on November 15th with the Insurance
Corporation of British Columbia (ICBC maintains all auto insurance and
registration) seeking to find out who had been accessing their personal
records.  They provided 8 of their license plate numbers to be checked.
<P>
The ICBC information officer explained that while daily access logs were
kept, accesses were not recorded in the personal records themselves.
Without specific dates to check, finding out who accessed their records
would be next to impossible.
<P>
So the women just guessed, based on when they'd been contacted.
<P>
Those were lucky guesses.  On December 6th, the information officer said
that 3 out of 8 records had been accessed, and those accesses were
suspicious, so he'd contacted the RCMP.  The accesses originated in the
Delta police department, in a suburb of Vancouver.
<P>
Any cheers for the power of the FOI legislation must be tempered by the fact
that the RCMP apparently sat on this issue for another month until,
frustrated after what was now four months with no signs of an investigation,
the women contacted the media.
<P>
Apparently, it was media inquiries that sparked some action.  On January
5th, the RCMP informed the Delta police that potentially inappropriate
computer accesses were coming from their department.  Constable Steve
Parker, whose anti-abortion views were well known, was now under a cloud of
suspicion.  The very same day, all Canadian TV networks ran news stories on
the situation.

Subject: Windows 95 Warning on comp.risks [<A HREF="/Risks/17.13.html">RISKS-17.13</A>], in Information Week
<P>
Microsoft officials confirm that beta versions of Windows 95 include a small
viral routine called Registration Wizard.  It interrogates every system on a
network gathering intelligence on what software is being run on which
machine.  It then creates a complete listing of both Microsoft's and
competitors' products by machine, which it reports to Microsoft when
customers sign up for Microsoft's Network Services, due for launch later
this year.
<P>
"In Short" column, page 88, _Information Week_ magazine, May 22,1995 The
implications of this action, and the attitude of Microsoft to plan such
action, beggars the imagination.
<P>
An update on this. A friend of mine got hold of the beta test CD of Win95,
and set up a packet sniffer between his serial port and the modem. When you
try out the free demo time on The Microsoft Network, it transmits your
entire directory structure in background.
<P>
This means that they have a list of every directory (and, potentially every
file) on your machine. It would not be difficult to have something like a
FileRequest from your system to theirs, without you knowing about it. This
way they could get ahold of any juicy routines you've written yourself and
claim them as their own if you don't have them copyrighted.
<P>
Needless to say, I'm rather annoyed about this.
So spread the word as far and wide as possible: Steer clear of Windows 95. =
<P>
There's nothing to say that this "feature" will be removed in the final
release.
<P>
[GML addition: Prodigy was accused of doing something similar several
years ago.  In that case it was not nearly as threatening due to: 1) it
was = limited to a single PC, 2) Prodigy couldn't do much with the info

<P>
I have to object to the inference that the woman was somehow electrocuted
because she was using a card key lock.
<P>
For those familiar with the VingCard system, there is NO WAY the woman could
have been electrocuted by the lock itself, as the card key is
(nonconductive) plastic.  The woman was likely electrocuted when she grabbed
the metal doorknob.
<P>
If a faulty A/C caused the problem by causing the door to acquire a charge
(obviously a metal door), she would have been electrocuted even if the hotel
had used a conventionally keyed door lock (and would have most likely been
zapped when she inserted the key into the lock).
<P>
An additional issue is the fact that most hotels have metal door frames (to
make it more difficult for a door to be kicked in), meaning that mere contact
with the door FRAME would most likely have been fatal.

<P>
Mini - Robots should make possible long-distance operations
<P>
Karlsruhe (German Press Agency) - scientists from Karlsruhe have developed a
Mini-robot which will enable remote surgery. The prototype has been built by
the university and the research center at Karlsruhe. These so-called
"Mikromanipulationsroboter" are about ten centimeters long and eight
centimeters broad and high.
<P>
The robot would be inserted in the field of operations and would allow
specialists from anywhere in the world to participate. The
computer-controlled instrument can make controlled movements with a
precision of a few microns.
<P>
It may lead to the construction of extremely small robots that could swim
through the veins of a person and, for example, remove plaque in
atherosclerotic arteries.
<P>
[Comments from MK:
<P>
Unless due attention is paid to protecting the data stream controlling these
devices, there will be direct human tragedy as a result of data errors,
radio-frequency interference, and from meddling by criminal hackers.
<P>
Can someone in the Karlsruhe area investigate the security measures being
put in place to protect surgical microbots from such interference?]

The quote is from the MIT Technical Report _Mental Poker_ by none other than
Adi Shamir, Ronald L. Rivest, and Leonard M. Adelman. (MIT-LCS-TM-125,
February 1979, about the same time they announced their RSA public key
cryptoscheme).  This was the seminal paper for the problem of of playing
poker without a card deck over the telephone (or Internet), related to many
other network protocols, such as oblivious transfer.
<P>
I have the actual MIT report, but it was also reprinted in _The Mathematical
Gardner,_ edited by David A. Klarner, Wadsworth, 1981. The original RSA's
protocol (later compromised, see below) is also described in Wayne
Patterson's book _Mathematical Cryptology_.
<P>
RSA attributed the question: _Is it possible to play a fair game of ``Mental
Poker''?_ to Robert W. Floyd. However Heisenberg mentions in his memoirs
that Niels Bohr invented mental card games during a boring ski trip and
tried without success to write protocols for them.
<P>
The protocol originally proposed in the RSA paper was to shown be insecure
by Don Coppersmith ("Cheating at Mental Poker") and by Ron Lipton (How to
Cheat at Mental Poker, _Proceeding of the AMS Short Course in Cryptography_,
AMS, January 1981). Lipton found a way to determine one bit about the
messages using the fact that exponent mod n preserves quadratic residuosity.
<P>
A secure protocol for only two players based on probabilistic encryption was
proposed by Shafi Goldwasser and Silvio Micali (Probabilistic Encryption &amp;
How to Play Mental Poker Keeping Secret All Partial Information. In
_Proceedings of the 14th Annual ACM Symposium on the Theory of Computing
(STOC)_, ACM-SIGACT, San Francisco, 1982, 365--377). This too was a seminal
paper on probabilistic encryption.
<P>
There are many variations on mental poker protocols for more than 2 players;
you may or may not have a "card dealer", trusted by all other players; allow
for collusion among some players. More papers on more then 2 players:

Blocking, and the Multi-Player Mental Poker Game (extended abstract). In

Computer Sciences #196, Springer Verlag, 1985, 439--453.
<P>
The paper by Imre B'ar'any, Zolt'an F"uredy, Mental Poker with Three or More
Players, _Information and Control_, v.59, 84--93, 1983, claims that a
similar problem for mental bridge was stated and partially solved by D.
Grigor'ev and Yu. Matiyasevich, but apparently not published in open
literature.
<P>
Steven Fortune and Michael Merritt, Poker Protocols, in _Crypto '84_,
454--464, also describe the history of mental card games.
<P>

Coalitions. In _Crypto '85_, 73--86.

In _Crypto '86_ 240--247.
<P>
(The above paper is closely related to Gilles Brassard and Claude Cr'epau,
Zero-Knowledge Simulation of Boolean Circuits, and to Gilles Brassard, Claude
Cr'epau, and Jean-Marc Robert, All-or-Nothing Disclosure of Secrets, also in
_Crypto '86_. In the last protocol the players are not required to reveal their
cards at the end of the game to show that they didn't cheat.)
<P>
Finally, the extended abstract by Oded Goldreich, Silvio Micali and A.
Widgerson (How to Play Any Mental Game, or: A Completeness Theorem for
Protocols with Honest Majority, In _Proceedings of the 19th Annual ACM
Symposium on the Theory of Computing (STOC)_, ACM-SIGACT, 1987, 218--229)
mentions a general solution for _any_ such mental game.
<P>
Conclusion: the effort is not small-scale, rather old, many important papers
in cryptography had to do with mental poker, and the subject seems to have
been beaten to death. There are protocols now that don't require a "trusted
dealer".

Several messages in Risks have reported supposed problems with TCAS II
(airborne collision avoidance system) that rumor said had led to near
misses.  I thought it might be helpful for us to hear the other side
occasionally and see the positive side of technology. Vivek Ratan found
this on misc.news.southasia:
<P>
Bombay, Jul 23 (PTI) Three cases of "air misses" involving Air India
Boeing 747 over Tehran air space have prompted the Indian civil aviation
authorities to take up the matter with Iranian aviation officials.  In a
recent communication to the civil aviation administrator in Tehran, the
director of civial aviation (DGCA), Mr H S Khola, pointed out three
instances which had occurred on December 14, 1994, January 6 and May 27
last.  In all the three cases, the commanders were alerted by the traffic
collision avoidance system (TCAS), fitted on the aircraft, and accordingly
took evasive action well in time to avoid near disasters.
In the December incident, the incoming flight from Toronto (AI
184) via London narrowly missed a Balkan air aircraft (flight No 8605)
at 27,000 feet near a point called "Zanjan" which comes under Tehran
flight information range (FIR). The Air India commander was reported to
have visually sighted the aircraft.
In the second case, Air India's flight (AI 159) to Paris narrowly
missed an Air Lanka flight (UL 549) near "Tabrij" at 35,000 feet.  Alerted
by TCAS warning followed by visual sighting, the aircraft descended to avoid
any collision.
In the May 1995 incident, the London bound flight (AI 111) received
TCAS warning near "Isfahen" again at 35,000 feet with another aircraft at
close proximity. The commander descended to avoid any collision.

mailed on July 21st.
<P>
After several minutes of serious grumbling, I called the 800-number mentioned
on the postcard, intending to whine very loudly.  It was busy, and remained so
for the rest of the afternoon.  The local business office number rang busy
most of the afternoon, but I managed to get through on about every fifth call,
and after seven or eight attempts to launch myself through the voice-mail
system (which was also generating internal busies!), finally reached a human
being.  Who informed me that the notification had erroneously gone out to the
wrong set of people, the customers (residential and business) whose area code
would /not/ be changing.
<P>
I noted, before ending the conversation, that mailing out the announcement
first class, to the wrong customers, a week after the effective date, was
unlikely to win any Good Management awards for TPC.
<P>
The computer risk seems obvious, that we have the power to cause vast
disruptions to people and systems on an almost casual basis.  In "the good old
days," people would have looked at the labels after testing the program and
verifying the counts.  Today, someone entered a command into a DBMS front-end
and went home for the weekend, secure in the knowledge that automated systems
would carry through the instructions without intervention.  As they appear to
have done, last Friday.
<P>
Here's the official Bell Atlantic press release for the incident.  I figure it
cost them at least twenty cents per postcard, around $100,000, just to make
the mistake; and that it will probably cost them another dime or so per
customer to sooth things over (if it's done with a simple bill enclosure on
the next cycle).

'703'CUSTOMERS GET '540' NOTICE IN ERROR
<P>
RICHMOND, VA --  Bell Atlantic misdirected some 388,000 post cards,
introducing the new 540 area code, to its customers in the northern
Virginia suburbs of Washington.  The cards were supposed to have gone
to '540' customers in the western part of the state.
<P>
The misdirected cards apparently were received by residential and
business customers throughout northern Virginia's 703 area code.  Bell
Atlantic officials suspect the mistake stems from a programming error.
<P>
The 540 area code stretches from Lee County in southwestern Virginia
northeast through Roanoke and the Shenandoah Valley to Winchester and
east to Fredericksberg.
<P>
The revised 703 area code includes the counties of Arlington, Fairfax,
Prince William and eastern Loudoun (to include Leesburg) and the
cities of Alexandria, Falls Church and Fairfax.

<P>
From the perspective of one of the members of the ACM Council that approved
the startup of the Risks Forum, I can say that RISKS has succeeded far
beyond what we dared to hope.  We hoped that it would be an opportunity for
people to speak up on issues about risks of computers that concerned them.
We hoped that this one forum would bring some organization to the chaotic
discussions about risks and would allow for reasonable and constructive
conclusions to emerge.  At the same time we were somewhat fearful that the
forum might be taken over by a small set of people who monopolized the
discussions (as was common on BBs), or that the interest in it would die out
in a couple of years.  But look at what has been accomplished:
<OL>
<LI> RISKS is vibrant, alive, and well after 10 years.
<LI> RISKS is taken seriously by many people as a reasonable
ongoing discussion of risks.  It has made ACM a key
player in this aspect of Internet.
<LI>RISKS has wide participation.
<LI> RISKS has very wide distribution.
<LI>RISKS is a good observation post for what is on
people's minds about computer-related risks.
<LI>RISKS has enabled the documentation of a large number
of mishaps, malfunctions, and catastrophes, giving
designers a solid base of information about what can
go wrong with their systems.  This documentation has been
summarized and analyzed in Peter's ACM Press book
(Computer-Related Risks, Addison-Wesley), and all back
issues of RISKS are available to anyone at any time on the Web.
</OL>
All this is in no small measure due to the gentle but firm hand of Peter
Neumann, our moderator, who has brought a clear vision of what a
constructive, serious on-line discussion about an important topic can be.
And he has made it real.

I saw "The Net" last night. For those of you who don't know about this new
movie, its basic plot is that a "computer analyst" named Angela Bennett runs
into the software equivalent of the "Sneakers" chip -- it will break into
anyplace. It's an ok movie, but worthy of Risks' attention because it is a
popularization of the sort of worries that we discuss all the time.
<P>
And it does a good job of that, I think. It's realistic but not too
alarmist. The resolution is a bit contrived, but aside from that the
technology is believable (and the IP equivalent of a 555-xxxx number is
xx.xxx.345.xxx).
<P>
But I kept wondering why, since this is set in California, Angela
didn't try to call PGN for help.... :-)

[An article in this morning's SanFranChron indicates that the
writers were inspired by a Japanese case of purloined identity
(which has not yet appeared in RISKS).  Evidently, their advice
came from elsewhere, although RISKS readers will recall Terry
Dean Rogan's misadventures as a primal case of being spoofed.
Also, in the movie, Angela sought almost no technohelp from anyone,
including law enforcement.  But as I watched the film, I was ready,
just in case she called.  BTW, the folks who brought you WarGames and
Sneakers are now working on a new film.  Stay tuned.  PGN]

<P>
The ten years that comp.risks has been in existence is not long enough
to get a good grip on trends involving risks in computers and related
systems.  To see why, consider the history of nineteenth-century railroading.
This is another technology the use of which grew explosively and that
evolved rapidly.  By 1870 or so, which is about the same amount of time
after railroading was first developed that 1995 is after digital computers
started to be used, it was very evident that there were risks in railroading.
One of the most prominent of them was the combination of derailments,
wooden passenger car bodies, and oil lamps.
<P>
Basically, in a derailment {or other wreck} the passengers would be
pinned inside the car by blockage of exits.  The oil lamps which had
been dislodged would set the body of the car on fire and the passengers
trapped inside would be burned alive.  In 1870 this was a serious problem
that, with the steadily increasing number of rail passengers and passenger-
miles, looked like it could only get worse.  By 1910 this problem had been
basically solved.  The solution was steel passenger car bodies, and
electric lighting.
<P>
An optimist can take comfort from the fact that this risk is now gone.
So far gone that only railfans with an interest in train wrecks {like my
father who bought a book on train wrecks, and I who read it} are even likely
to remember it.  Further, the solution was in large part technical, and did
not involve massive changes in people or social institutions.  As a final
point of encouragement the widespread adoption of electric lighting aboard
railroad passenger trains was not an evident possibility in 1870.  So
sometimes new technology does save you.
<P>
A pessimist could point out that forty years is a long time to wait
for a solution to a problem as obvious as this one.  He could also point out
that my selected example of a railroading risk was carefully chosen to
expose a problem which had been forgotten.  If I had focused not on the
narrow and specific risk of passengers being burned alive in derailed cars,
but had instead focused on the more general problem of derailments, I would
be discussing a problem that is still with us.  Indeed, derailments could
be offered as a problem which has been aggravated by the widespread adoption
of a new technology.  The technology referred to of course is the much more
widespread use of toxic chemicals carried in tank cars.  Likewise, collisions
between trains, a risk evident in 1840, are still happening and being
discussed in comp.risks as of June 1995.
<P>
Believers in upgrading and improving systems could use my example
risk as support for their position.  The adoption of steel passenger-car
bodies depended on the development of more powerful locomotives, which
in turn required heavier rail and a better quality of roadbed to operate.
Thus the solution of an apparently narrow and specific problem turned out
to hinge on substantial upgrade of the system as a whole {which was actually
done for other reasons}.  Supporters of system upgrade have a proposal to
mitigate if not solve the problem of derailments, too: track maintenance.
A partial explanation for the rise in problem derailments {actually, all
derailments are a problem but not all derailments make CNN, which is what
I am referring to} is the reduction of maintenance of way expenditures to
the barest possible minimum by many railroad companies.  The results of this
will be predictable to most engineers.
<P>
Cynics, of course, can point to this risk as evidence that people
worry about the wrong things.  Another effect of railroading, not as obvious
in 1870 as it is now, is to improve the effectiveness of mass mobilization
in wartime.  This turned out to be a precondition of World Wars I &amp; II,
far more destructive events than all the train wrecks of the nineteenth
century combined.  But while train wrecks made headlines in the nineteenth
century, the impact of railroading on military mobilization did not.
<P>
The point of all this is that there has been a historical parallel
to the introduction of new risks with the mass adoption of computer
technology, namely the introduction of new risks with the mass adoption of
railroad technology.  Many of the positions now being argued with regard
to computer related risk have analogues that could be argued with regard to
railroad related risk.  Since it is not clear even now which position
would have been generally correct in 1870 with regard to railroad related
risk, I do not think we have the data to reach accurate conclusions about
computer related risk.
<P>
The railroad analogy does reinforce some recurrent themes in
comp.risks, though.  If you want to eliminate a risk, your best bet is to
analyze the system as a whole, determine the preconditions of the risk,
and change the system to remove them.  After all, the proximate cause of
most of the train wrecks in which passengers were burned alive was operator
error.  The elimination of the risk involved going to steel passenger car
bodies, though, which is not obviously related to the proximate cause of
any particular accident.
<P>
Measures necessary to reduce or eliminate a risk are often expensive.
Replacing the entire US stock of wooden passenger cars with steel ones was
not cheap, and the railroad companies were not happy about doing it.
<P>
Social reforms that reduce strain on people can also increase their
reliability, and thus the safety of a system.  The ten hour day on the
railroads {1916 if I remember right}, was an important reform that made
things safer for passengers.  Perhaps a ten hour day for programmers ...
{just kidding, just kidding}.
<P>
Finally, extremes of hope and despair should be avoided.  If the
railroading analogy is any guide, we shall end up in neither perdition nor
paradise.  Particular risks will be eliminated, risk as a whole will not,
and there will still be nice people unhappy about risk in the year 2100.

<P>
It has been argued elsewhere that it is too soon to tell which risks
are the most significant, and how best to deal with them.  Unfortunately,
decisions about what risks to fight, how, will have to be made before the
verdict of history is in.  It would be better if these decisions were made
after some consideration of the information available to us, rather than by
throwing darts in the dark {though reports are that as regards the stock
market, darts are not as bad a means of decision making as one might at
first suppose}.
<P>
My suggestion is that those who are concerned about computer-related
risks should focus their attention on the risks to privacy resulting from
massive data collection and analysis using computer systems.  A secondary
problem area, coming up fast, are the unknown psychological effects of both
the Internet and the increasing availability of virtual reality.
<P>
There are a number of reasons for focusing on these risks, among the
many risks that are out there.  The first and strongest reason is that these
risks arise from the intentional use of computers working more or less as
designed.  Thus there is no natural counterforce working to contain these
risks.
<P>
By contrast, one can consider a widely discussed {at least in RISKS},
risk: fly-by-wire aircraft.  Whatever the problems with the design of the
A320, or possibly the 777, there are a large number of people working for
the manufacturers, airlines and regulators, who are strongly against
aircraft crashes.  Aircraft crashes are thoroughly investigated and their
causes widely reported in magazines devoted to flight, and the air safety
community is well developed.  Computer related risks as they affect aircraft
will be dealt with by the air safety community in the normal course of
business.  When one also considers that flight is one of the safest means of
travel currently available, the conclusion that the total additional risk to
our lives and values resulting from the use of computers ... given the
continued existence of a strong aviation safety community ... is not major.
<P>
Similarly, the problems related to the use of computers in medical
equipment are in effect a subset of the problems raised by iatrogenic
disease in general.  While the impression I get is that the medical safety
community is underdeveloped relative to the air safety community {i.e. there
are fewer and less powerful people interested in medical safety, and that
the medical equivalent of the FAA is much weaker}, it is very doubtful that
medical safety would be significantly increased by focusing more of the
existing medical safety effort on computer related aspects of the overall
risk of iatrogenic disease.  Thus, it is not clear that computer people
should demand that medical safety effort be reallocated to deal with
computer problems would be a welcome thing.  After all, in arguing that
computer related risks make only a minor contribution to the overall risk, I
am merely assuming that the small number of reports in risks of computer
related death or injury are a realistic sample of the problem.
<P>
It is possible to go through a number of the other risks discussed in
comp.risks and make similar arguments.  While a knowledge of computer related
risks in these areas is valuable, and should be made available to the
relevant safety communities, these risks are already being dealt with.
It may be that we need to strengthen the medical safety community, but we
probably do not want the computer safety community to replace it.  Look at
the whole system, not merely the computer related portion of the risk.
<P>
By contrast, the risks to privacy posed by modern computer technology
are nobody else's responsibility.  And since they arise from the use of
the machines as designed, they will not be reduced by the normal efforts
of engineers to make things work better.  They will be increased by
the normal efforts of engineers to make things work better.
<P>
The reason for the interest in the effects of the Internet and VR
technology is simply that they are unknown.  People are reporting problems
with "Internet addiction", and as an old gamer I can see where there might
be a problem with people preferring VR flight simulators to their real
lives.  Not being a member of the media, I will not suggest panic.  Some
psychological studies, to see if this risk is real and how big it is, do
seem appropriate though.
<P>
In short, my recommendation is that efforts to increase the use
of computers in ways which will invade and reduce personal privacy be
resisted with all of the power available to the Computer Science community.
The extent of computer related contribution to medical risks should be
studied.  Psychological studies of the effects of the Internet, and VR,
should be supported if the methodology is reasonably sound and the intent
of the authors is not sensationalistic.  What has been learned about computer
related risk should be communicated to members of the appropriate safety
communities.
<P><ADDRESS>

</ADDRESS><P>
P.S.  I suspect a lot of readers will question my assumption that sound
methodology exists in psychological studies.  From a scholarly perspective,
I might even agree.  But this is about policy, not scholarship, and while
proof would be nice, clues will do.

<P>
What is the problem that causes computer-related risks today?  Is it the
technology? The people? Those of us who read RISKS on a regular basis
understand that it is people expecting too much from technology.
<P>
Why do people expect too much from technology? Sometimes it is lack of
understanding. A large part of the problem is that the computer profession
has oversold its product. Computers, people are told, can do anything. And
if they can't do it now, they will tomorrow.  Computers are perfect and
full-proof.
<P>
Wrong.
<P>
Things are better today. In our profession, the awareness of the limitations
of computers is at an all-time high. There exist forums such as the Risks
Forum, and Peter Neumann's own columns in CACM. A look into bookstores
reveals many recent books such as the second edition of Theodore Roszak's
"The Cult Of Information", Lauren Wiener's "Digital Woes", Clifford Stoll's
"Silicon Snake Oil", and Peter Neumann's "Computer-Related Risks". And many
that are more recent. At the university I attended, the reading for my
course-work included Frederick Brooks' "The Mythical Man-Month", the ACM TWA
case study, Donald Norman's "The Design of Everyday Things", and the ACM
Code of Ethics. Awareness of the computer's limitations and risks is
certainly being passed on to the next generation of computer professionals.
So, why do the risks still exist?
<P>
It goes back to the computer having been oversold in the past. People have
been told that the computer can do things that it can not or should not do.
The government of the United States once attempted to develop the Strategic
Defense Initiative (SDI or "Star Wars"). It took a group of computer
professionals to come forward and point out how impossible such a project
is. SDI is just one of many things that people assume computers can do. The
problem is not only in government. The problem is everywhere.  Corporate
leaders and futurists such as Alvin Toffler tell the public what the
computer can, can not, and will do. United States Congressman Newt Gingrich
often cites Alvin Toffler's visions of technology and the future. It is my
thinking that Congressman Gingrich should balance his reading diet with the
works of Neumann and Roszak.
<P>
So what do we, as computer professionals, do now? Our primary problem is
that we have been preaching to the converted. The computer professional is
the primary reader of RISKS and related subject matter.  We need to share
the message of RISKS. We need to preach to the unconverted. As Justin Wells
suggested in <A HREF="/Risks/17.19.html">RISKS-17.19</A>, we need to push for a risks segment in our evening
news. We need television programs and newspaper columns. We need to get the
message out to everyone.
<P>
The RISKS tidal wave is only beginning to come in. It needs to wash over
everything. Happy Birthday, RISKS! Here's to 10 years and hopefully many
more.

<P>
For decades I've heard that software can't ever be as safe or reliable as
hardware.  That makes me feel uneasy, because it rings untrue. Instinct
tells me it has nothing to do with software per se, but merely in how we
structure it.  The following is a little thought exercise.  Risks readers
can amuse themselves picking it apart.
<P>
Complex electric circuits are comprised of networks of connected components.
Each component (like a resistor, or a transistor) is very simple.
<P>
Suppose we wrote a simulation of one of these simple components, say a
resistor.  The simulator would have a CPU, memory, and A/D and D/A
converters for each of the devices port. It would also have an battery, if
we're going to avoid external power connections.  Now package the simulator
in epoxy with just two external ports, just as if it were a real resistor.
Within a limited domain, the simulated resistor ought to be able to pass a
Turing test in that one could not distinguish it from a real resistor.
<P>
Given bins of identical simulators for the needed basic components, we would
have the raw materials to build circuit boards of arbitrary complexity.  The
question is, how do the hardware and simulator based versions of the same
board inherently differ in complexity and reliability?
<P>
Granted, a simulator of a resistor is more complex than an actual resistor.
That gives hardware a slight edge from the start.  However, [and this is the
real point], the simulator - hardware complexity gap would *not* grow
proportional to the number of components on the circuit board.  All
instances of the resistor simulator are alike.  The complexities of the
circuit interconnections are identical for both implementations.
<P>
My conclusion is that there is no *a priori* reason why software
based systems can not have the same risks as hardware based
implementations of the identical external requirements and
identical design (i.e. circuit level design). Is that correct?

While thinking about trends shown in the history of the Risks Digest, I also
came across an article in _Software Development_,  Vol 3 No. 7, July 1995 (a
Miller-Freeman publication).  I think it has some very good comments in it.
<P>
The article is "Project-Level Design Archetypes", by David Bond.  The
sub-head is, "Choosing the 'best practices' touse for your software
development project depends on the type of project you're dealing with."  He
goes on to say, "If you are tuned into the debate over software development
practices, you are aware of how polarized this debate can be.  Each side
trumpets its view of what development is all about and largely ignores what
the others have to say.  Each point of view is based on real experiences.
Each side mistakenly assumes all software development projects are similar
enough that one set of strategies works for all."
<P>
He goes on to discuss Constrained Software (and SEI Maturity Levels),
Internal Client Software, Veritcal Market Software, and Mass Market
Software.  In each section, he lists the critical success factors, in
approximate order of importance.  For instance, under Mass Market Software,
the lists is "Marketing, Timeliness, Features, Cost, Ease of Use".
Constrained software, as in embedded software or government contracts, is
"Adherence to the contract, including schedule and cost, Quality,
Maintainability and extendibility".
<P>
He further describes the impact of these different lists on choosing a "best
practice" strategy (which is why SEI Maturity Levels are under Constrained
Software).  Since many of the "failure to deliver" anecdotes in Risks relate
to Information Systems, the key items in this article are
<OL>
<LI> "If you look at the tradition of systems engineering, requirements
changes are considered undesirable."
<P>
<LI>"On the other hand, most information systems departments have
learned...that they must accommodate change."
<P>
<LI>"One tremendous advantage of systems engineering is that it appears to
scale up better.  Various studies have indicated a high failure rate of
large information systems projects.  This is probably because large projects
often involve issues beyond just software.  Systems engineering is aimed at
managing precisely these kinds of projects."
</OL>
I strongly recommend the entire article.

P.S.  I have been reading a lot of back issues of the past several months,
because you just can't keep up with enough new issues for my appetite.  So I
have noticed some trends, as with the IS systems mentioned.  Another trend
is that there is often a lot of discussion of anticipated impacts of
regulatory changes before they occur, and rarely any followup after they
occur  --  or if they did occur.
<P>
But keep up the good work.  I often find pithy things in the digests to
share with my coworkers.  <I>/dps</I>

<P>
Readers of Risks need no awareness-raising about dependability problems in
human-computer interaction.  There are too many reports of transportation,
power or weapons systems in which operator misunderstanding or abuse of the
control interface had tragic consequences.  Serious, if not tragic, reports
of economic losses or inefficiencies can be traced to ambiguities or
opacities in the information supplied to users or in the rules governing
system operation.  Some reports have attributed failures to the human
interface that are really due to system designs that place impossible
demands on operators.  The maintenance interface is also a source of
failures, from small to gigantic.  Use of computers by groups introduces
problems of human communication to the human-computer interface.
<P>
Design of the human-computer interface for dependability has been attended
to seriously in numerous applications; for example, several Risks reports
have described very diligent attention to human interface issues by aircraft
designers, and there are other serious industrial efforts.  Most of these
are concerned with highly critical applications, and it is not clear that
results from one application domain can be used in others.
<P>
It would seem appropriate to have some general results about dependability
and the human interface that can be applied across different domains and
over different degrees of criticality.  What are the fundamental issues?
How should we characterize problems at the human interface?  How can we
measure and observe interface risks and errors?  How should interfaces be
designed for low risk and for tolerating interface faults?  How can systems
be designed to prevent unreasonable requirements at the interface?  Answers
to these questions are not evident in current professional communications.
<P>
How should this study start?  What are the right questions?  What good
results exist that can be generalized?  What would a good testbed contain?
What are the right forums for communicating results?  Is anyone working on
these issues?
<P>
Despite many years of research in user interfaces, their dependability
doesn't seem to be improving.  (Yes, we are aware of all the research done
in the CHI community.)  This leaves us with the somewhat rhetorical
question: how would someone demonstrate that an interface could be depended
upon for a certain mission-critical application (such as a display in a
hospital operating room)?

Sometime during 28 July 1995, a chilly evening, a group of homeless located
under one of the Minneapolis bridges started a fire.  This fire melted three
fiber-optic cables connecting some local systems to the Internet.  The media
(radio, television and print) reported all local access to the Internet was
gone, but phone service (including long distance) was still available.  I
didn't see any correction(s) reporting some Internet access was through
phone lines.  Nor did I hear what happened to the `homeless'.

Ford Motor Co. decided its latest PR blitz would include a high-tech twist
-- a press kit on a floppy disk.  The only problem is, the disk contained a
"monkey virus," which, among other things, can make it appear as if all the
data's been erased from the hard drive.  "Just don't use it," says a Ford
spokesman, who couldn't explain how the disks could have become
contaminated.  Ford followed up by sending all recipients apologetic letters
via, you guessed it, snail mail.  (Tampa Tribune 31 July 1995, B&amp;F2)

This would be funny if not so sad &amp; is just the latest of a long line
of manufacturers who have sent out infected disks. PB gave us the
MusicBug early in this decade (still have some sealed floppies if there is
any doubt). Intel gave us the Michelangelo.
<P>
The depressing fact is that the *easiest* thing to detect is a boot sector
virus on a floppy disk since it is always changes one specific sector that
should always be the same. Five years ago I wrote a generic freeware floppy
boot sector virus detector/restorer (FixFbr). It still works.
<P>
IMNSHO though, anyone who sends out a floppy disk to unsuspecting people
without knowing exactly what is on the disk (would be easy to do random
sampling and compute/compare every byte with a certified master - take about
five minutes per disk and would only require that one be checked from each
batch) has not exhibited "due care". Said this in print in 1992 and have
been saying ever since. Where is Ralph Nader when you need him ?
<P>
The RISK is not that there was a virus on the disk. The real RISK is
of a manufacturer does not know *exactly* what IS on the disk, the virus
is just a symptom of a much deeper problem.
<P>
CAVEAT: have not seen the disk (yet - would like one for my collection) but
this note seemed to come from a reputable source. Tried calling Ford
but no-one seemed to know what I was talking about. The fourth person
did agree to try to find out &amp; said they would call back. RSN. My
opinion of any such incident still stands.

A controversy is growing around the failure of "Intelligent Transportation
System" programs in the United States to exercise any leadership in the
adoption of technologies for privacy protection.  As deployment of these
systems accelerates, some of the transportation authorities have begun to
recognize the advantages of anonymous toll collection technologies.  For
example, if you don't have any individually identifiable records then you
won't have to respond to a flood of subpoenas for them.  Many, however, have
not seen the point of protecting privacy, and some have expressed an active
hostility to privacy concerns, claiming that only a few fanatics care so
much about privacy that they will decline to participate in surveillance-
oriented systems.  That may in fact be true, for the same reason that only a
few fanatics refuse to use credit cards.  But that does not change the
advantages to nearly everyone of using anonymous technologies wherever they
exist.
<P>
Let me report two developments, one bright and one dark.  On the bright
side, at least one company is marketing anonymous systems for automatic toll
collection in the United States: AT/Comm Incorporated, America's Cup
Building, Little Harbor, Marblehead MA 01945; phone (617) 631-1721, fax
-9721.  Their pitch is that decentralized systems reduce both privacy
invasions and the hassles associated with keeping sensitive records on
individual travel patterns.  Another company has conducted highway-speed
trials of an automatic toll-collection mechanism based on David Chaums
digital cash technology: Amtech Systems Corporation, 17304 Preston Road,
Building E-100, Dallas TX 75252; phone: (214) 733-6600, fax -6699.  Because
of the total lack of leadership on this issue at the national level, though,
individuals need to do what they can to encourage local transportation
authorities to use technologies of anonymity.  It's not that hard: call up
your local state Department of Transportation or regional transportation
authority, ask to talk to the expert on automatic toll collection, find out
what their plans are in that area, and ask whether they are planning to use
anonymous technologies.  Then call up the local newspaper, ask to talk to
the reporter who covers technology and privacy issues, and tell them what
you've learned.
<P>
On the dark side, here is a quotation from a report prepared for the State of
Washington's Department of Transportation by a nationally prominent consulting
firm called JHK &amp; Associates (page 6-9):
<P>
Cellular Phone Probes.  Cellular phones can be part of the backbone of a
region-wide surveillance system.  By distributing sensors (receivers) at
multiple sites (such as cellular telephone mast sites), IVHS technology
can employ direction finding to locate phones and to identify vehicles
where appropriate.  Given the growing penetration of cellular phones (i.e.,
estimated 22% of all cars by 2000), further refinements will permit much
wider area surveillance of vehicle speeds and origin-destination movements.
<P>
This is part of a larger discussion of technologies of surveillance that can
be used to monitor traffic patterns and individual drivers for a wide
variety of purposes, with and without individuals' consent and knowledge.
The report speaks frankly of surveillance as one of three functionalities of
the IVHS infrastructure.  (The others are communications and data
processing.)  The means of surveillance are grouped into "static
(roadway-based)", "mobile (vehicle-based)", and "visual (use of live video
cameras)".  The static devices include "in-pavement detectors", "overhead
detectors", "video image processing systems", and "vehicle occupancy
detectors".  The mobile devices include various types of "automatic vehicle
identification", "automatic vehicle location", "smart cards", and the
just-mentioned "cellular phone probes".  The visual devices are based on
closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras that can seve a wide range of
purposes.
<P>
The underlying problem here, it seems to me, is an orientation toward
centralized control: gather the data, pull it into regional management
centers, and start manipulating traffic flows by every available means.
Another approach, much more consonant with the times, would be to do things
in a decentralized fashion: protecting privacy through total anonymity and
making aggregate data available over the Internet and wireless networks so
that people can make their own decisions.  Total surveillance and
centralized control has been the implicit philosophy of computer system
design for a long time.  But the technology exists now to change that, and I
can scarcely imagine a more important test case than the public roads.
People need to use roads to participate in the full range of associations
(educational, political, social, religious, labor, charitable, etc etc) that
make up a free society.  If we turn the roads into a zone of total
surveillance then we chill that fundamental right and undermine the very
foundation of freedom.

The 31 July 1995 issue of _Forbes_ includes an article (pp. 136-7) on the
products of Apache Medical Systems, which predict patient outcomes based on
a database of "400,000 hospital admittances covering 100-odd diseases.  From
these statistics Apache's software can predict patient survival with an
accuracy that can *sometimes* beat that of doctors' hunches."  [fake italics
mine]
<P>
The software is intended to guide the doctor's choice of treatment.  Several
examples are given, include a rather chilling one in which the supposed
objectivity of the computer is enlisted to coax a husband for permission to
take his wife off a respirator and let her die.  The doctor who founded the
company (Dr. Knaus) is quoted as saying he created the system because "I
wasn't smart enough to figure out what to do in each situation."  Another
highlight: "Many hospitals adopted the Apache system to cut costs and
measure quality in intensive care units."
<P>
The article closes with a brief discussion of the ethical issues, in which
Dr. Knaus says: "If I were [the patient], I would want to be judged on Apache.
It knows only those facts that are relevant to my condition, not race or
insurance coverage, which have been used to allocate care in the past."
<P>
In other words, the computerized system is good because it is an improvement
over a deeply flawed, inequitable, and racist system?

*The New York Times* 2 Aug 1995 contains a story about the apprehension of a
homeless man as a murder suspect in NYC.  Apparently, a digital wristwatch
not belonging to the victim was discovered near her body on the floor of her
apartment.  NYC police found a number stored in the watch's memory, which
they identified as an account number at Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, a bank
with several branches in NYC.
<P>
Having previously been evicted from his home (his mother's residence), the
suspect was homeless and therefore not easily located.  Police solved this
problem by asking the bank to put a hold on the account, which showed a
history of monthly veteran's benefit check deposits.  The suspect showed up
at various branches to withdraw money, was turned away on each occasion, and
eventually appeared at one of the remaining branches (which was staked out
by the police).
<P>
He is now in custody, and was scheduled to be arraigned today on
charges of murder and attempted rape.

flaws.  Randal Schwartz, 33, was convicted Tuesday on three counts of
computer crimes after a 2 1/2 week jury trial in Washington County Superior
Court.  [He was convicted of stealing passwords, and making unauthorized
changes in Intel network.]

<P>
Okay, now that I've seen <A HREF="/Risks/17.22.html">RISKS-17.22</A> I can't contain my desire to offer up
my opinion.  I've followed RISKS closely for 6 years; I paid less complete
attention before that.  I've learned a heck of a lot from RISKS; it has a
remarkable signal-to-noise ratio for which I thank PGN first (3 cheers for
our leader; hip, hip...) and the many wise and thoughtful contributors
immediately after.  But you see, it's not enough.  I mean, RISKS, like any
other voluntary, self-selected-participation communication forum, isn't
enough to counteract the problems in the industry.
<P>
Very many of the items and issues discussed in RISKS reveal that the
perpetrators of the problems either missed or ignored the lessons of those
who went before.  Remember the SGI development memo in <A HREF="/Risks/15.80.html">RISKS-15.80</A>?  Just
about every problem identified in that memo had been discussed in Fred P.
Brooks' _Mythical Man Month_ years before.  And the SGI folks had NO CLUE.
I could adduce hundreds of similar examples of people with "new" problems
documented in RISKS that were really variations on OLD problems.  Okay, so
some problems come up over and over.  But the shared experience of
practitioners (shared through books, articles, RISKS, etc.) ought to help
people (a) avoid, (b) mitigate or minimize, and (c) fix such problems, but
it seems like many people walk right past the bridges and jump into the
chasm.  Now, I'll admit that when someone *avoids* a problem or class of
problems successfully, that doesn't often get written up in RISKS.  Perhaps
RISKS suffers from the same "bad news sells" syndrome that politicians like
to denounce in newspapers.  But somehow (based on my personal experience in
the industry plus what I pick up...) I don't think reality is that simple or
that happy.
<P>
We need RISKS.  We need the books by Brooks, and Don Norman, and all the
others.  We need the articles, the conferences, and even the water-cooler
bull-sessions.
<P>
But what we really need is to figure out how to reach the practitioners who
aren't curious about these issues.  Perhaps we can try to influence the
early training of programmers.  Maybe every "Dumbkopf's Guide to C++" book
ought to have some RISKS horror stories in it.  Perhaps we could arrange
out-of-band rewards (ACM prizes?) for developers who do-the-right-thing and
encrypt their password files, use checksums to validate key entry of
patient-record-ID's, apply systematic design principles to their projects,
provide useful documentation, etc.
<P>
One factor that seems to promote a great many problems is schedule pressure.
Under schedule pressure developers stop building tools before production
parts, abandon formalized methods, choose not to implement RAS-critical or
testability items on the theory that they'll take too long, postpone
preparing documentation (often forever), and so forth.  We fancy-pants RISKS
readers know that these are often false economies.  Whatever system may
emerge from a panicked development will likely have many problems.  Worse,
we know that panic frequently will not shorten the delivery schedule, since
every foolish economy will be offset (sometimes exceeded) by cost (time and
money) to correct its effects.  We have to come up with good methods to
avoid problems that everyone believes will shorten schedules rather than
stretching them.  Most software developers use igh-level (level 3) languages
now.  Hardware developers use CAD/CAM systems.  Tools like these help
shorten schedules at the same time that they help developers avoid certain
types of problems (for example, a well-realized CAD system provide
simulation to make sure modules fit properly at interfaces).  In this vein,
we need to come up with tools and methods that minimize RISKS without
appearing to bulge schedules.  People will always blow off that NASA
waterfall chart when their software project is behind the calendar.  We need
to replace it with stuff they'll reach out for like a drowning man for a
life preserver.  (I'm only moderately hopeful here, because entropy suggests
that you can always deliver crap faster than quality... but we've gotta
try.)
<P>
The other RISK, not of poorly realized systems but of systems that do
hateful things (like, say, electronic payment systems that provide retailers
with detailed personal information about customers without their
(customers') knowledge or consent) we must approach in another way.  We've
got to distinguish between poor design (say, failure to use crypto to secure
cell-phone ID's) for which people are tempted to compensate with stupid
policy (e.g., private policy: restrict roaming; public policy: criminalize
possession of radio receivers capable of tuning cell-phone freqs) and
deliberately warped design (say, the Clipper chip) *caused* by bad policy
(private: kissing DoD/FBI heinie; public: attempting to spy on everyone).
Every scheme (of education, tool-building, whatever) we deploy against
ineffective development applies to the poor-design problem.  But I think we
need a different approach to the evil design problem...
<P>
Social pressure affects people a lot.  To avert evil system designs, our
best tactic is to promote an ethos that despises people who participate in
the design or construction of evil systems.  We need to cultivate cultural
pressure against such people.  We want people to internalize that ethos
(that is, we want them to find such work loathsome), and we want them to
externalize it (that is, we want them to actively scorn and revile people
who do such work).  The second, external, form of pressure will ensure the
adoption of the first, and help deter evil behaviour even from people who
have not internalized our ethos but who wish to avoid offending those who
have.  I suggest that we've been far too nice recently.  We practitioners
haven't properly ostracized the (for example) Dorothy Dennings of the world.
<P>
We need RISKS to keep the people who give a damn in touch.  We need RISKS so
people like myself (your humble contributor) will have something to learn
from.  And--going into the future--we need to work toward disseminating
methods and attitudes that will help avert and minimize risks.  I don't read
a single issue of RISKS without considering what (if any) lessons from it I
can use or share with colleagues.  I frequently excerpt (will full
attribution and a back pointer to the complete record) RISKS Digest for my
friends and coworkers.  And I strive constantly to promote better design
GOALS, better methods, and better implementation techniques for the projects
I work on.  (I don't claim consistent success, but I make my effort...).
<P>
The anniversary lesson is: since we keep seeing the same stuff come up with
only minor variations in detail, we've got to work these problems at some
more basic levels.  Reading and/or contributing to RISKS is voluntary.
We've got to *push* RISK awareness on other people.  Subtly, I hope; by
example, I hope.  But somehow.

In RISKS' self-congratulatory TENTH ANNIVERSARY ISSUE Prof.  Peter Denning
wrote, "RISKS is vibrant, alive, and well after 10 years."  I am not so
sure.
<P>
The first step towards solving a problem is raising awareness.  In the case of
RISKS, it was important to make people aware of the risks of using computers.
As people became aware of the immense power of our technology, we wanted them
to understand that although computers were becoming larger, faster, and more
pervasive, computer systems were far from infallible and one can not
assume that they will function correctly.
<P>
Awareness is not an end in itself.  After awareness should come understanding.
We should be trying to understand why computers are so untrustworthy
that some of our leading experts avoid computer controlled aircraft, oppose
reliance on computers in nuclear plants, etc.
<P>
Even understanding should not be our final goal.  After understanding should
come a discussion of solutions.  We should be looking for ways to make
computers more trustworthy, to reduce the risks of using this highly
beneficial technology.
<P>
I think that the first goal has been achieved.  In addition to RISKS, which is
widely read by professionals, reporters, and users, we have seen the
publication of several very good consciousness raising books.  More and more,
we find that RISKS is simply distributing stories that have appeared in the
press somewhere.  Instead of getting direct reports from professionals
describing their own professional experiences, we are getting reports of what
they read in their local papers.  Some regular contributors seem to do nothing
but run a clipping service.  Frankly, after a while, many these stories sound
he same.  They are superficial, provide few technical details, and no new
insights.  RISKS is often quite boring.  There are a few detailed reports from
someone with professional understanding of the problem but they are often
buried among news clips.  Some writers add their own professional analysis and
occasionally we hear a new idea, but those are the exceptions.
<P>
It is time for RISKS to turn its attention to the next two phases.  We need to
try to understand why these errors keep happening and what we can do about
them.  We should leave the cute stories to the public press and move on.  Only
then, will I agree that RISKS is vibrant, alive and well.

<P>
The example that Dick provides nicely illustrates the fallacy that software
is inherently less reliable than hardware.
<P>
Consider the situation where a system in operation (or test) fails.  We
observe the failure and may, if we are bright enough, be able to track that
failure down to some flaw. We can now use a very crude measure and
categorize the flaw: design-time or run-time.
<P>
Dick's example shows, to a reasonable level of confidence, that it is
possible to equate software and hardware systems at run-time.  If his
resistor simulation is sufficiently accurate, the software simulation will
suffer from run-time failures in the same way as actual resistors fail. If
not, we might have better run-time behavior in the software analog than we
do in the hardware system.
<P>
Both of the systems will suffer from the same design-time flaws. They
have to by the nature of the design of the experiment.
<P>
It is an interesting motherhood statement that software is inherently less
reliable than hardware. There must be some reason that this statement is
generally believed. The obvious reason is that our software systems have
more design time flaws than our hardware systems. I have two plausible
explanations for the greater number of design-time flaws in software.
<OL>
<LI>We are designing far more complicated software systems than hardware
systems.
<LI>We are less careful designing software than hardware because the
perceived cost to change software is less than the perceived cost to change
hardware.
</OL>
I suspect that it is a combination of these factors that leads to
more design-time flaws in software.

<P>
The software in my home thermostat works just fine.  I would have expected a
mechanical clock to have broken down by now.
<P>
Large software systems of the kind whose reliability we discuss over the net
are seldom designed this way*.  It is not the case that there are several
hundred thousand copies of a few dozen basic modules that are connected
through narrow interfaces, with all of the complexity being in the topology
of the interconnections.  Instead, the interfaces are relatively fat, and as
the program grows in complexity it gets fatter and less well structured.
Imagine if you will a world in which you could add wires to any point inside
your 554 chips or resistors or transistors just by conceiving of a nice wire
to add.
<P>
Furthermore, the reliability traps in software systems are mostly design
faults, but the reliability traps in hardware systems are mostly component
failures, with some design failures thrown in.
<P>
Hardware reliability is an issue in software systems as well as in hardware
ones, of course, but the nature of software systems is such that you can gain
confidence in the reliability of your hardware by using it in unrelated
applications; this is only true at the component level in hardware systems.
<P>
The real reason why software appears to be not as reliable as hardware is
twofold:
<UL>
<LI>the very malleability of software beguiles us into doing less thorough
testing before fielding
<P>
<LI>the low unit cost of fielding** an additional unit of complexity induces us
to design software systems with so many components that an analogous
hardware system would have been unthinkable.
</UL>
We should not say "software can't ever be as safe as hardware".
<P>
We should say instead "There is obviously a correlation between system
complexity and presence of design flaws.  Since the cost v. complexity curve is
steeper for hardware than software, there is also likely to be a correlation
between system complexity and system software content.  Therefore, there will
be a correlation between system software content and presence of design flaws,
but this in itself does not show causation."

* object oriented designs come closer to this methodology, which is partially
why they gain a following in some circles.
<P>
** If you double the complexity of a program, you need to use a bigger disk or
add a SIMM or two -- no big deal.  If you double the complexity of a piece
of hardware, you are likely to double the fielding cost.

The Federal Administration's Fremont (Oakland) air-traffic control center
was "off-the-air" yesterday (9 Aug 1995) due to a local power outage.  Power
died at 7:13 a.m. as technicians were doing maintenance.  Both the archaic
system and the even more archaic backup system were down.  The center lost
all radar and radio contact with airborne planes, which is most unusual --
although it has happened before.  The immediate effects continued for over
one hour, and the aftereffects lasted long after that as planes were kept on
the ground waiting for the mess to clear.  (The Oakland center covers an
18-million square mile circle including the northern California border and
San Luis Obispo to the south, more than half way to L.A.)  Fortunately, the
weather over northern California was good, and en-route flights could
operate visually.  [Source: David Dietz, San Francisco Chronicle, 10 Aug
1995, p. 1.  David noted that in the past four months, computers have failed
20 times at the ATC centers in Chicago, Washington DC, Dallas-FortWorth,
Cleveland, and New York.  Long-time RISKS readers are not surprised.

" ...The defective units are Fluke 70 Series 2 and Fluke 77 Series 2
The problem occurs when the DMM is used to test D.C. voltages
between 500 and 1000 volts. If the test leads are connected
to the D.C. source terminals with reversed polarity, the display
will read 0 volts. If the leads are then reversed to the correct
polarity, the display remains locked on the zero volts reading.
Therefore, someone could be testing a 1000 volt D.C. source,
and obtain a reading of zero. If this meter is being used to
verify a de-energised state, there is a risk of unintended contact
with a lethal voltage...."
<P>
Carlson adds:
<P>
The memo does indicated that this false zero reading and the locked-up
state has been verified by the manufacturer.
<P>
I'm not familiar with the particular model in question, but presumably it
has a digital display, and hence is fair game for RISKS.  For those who
don't know, the odd-sounding Fluke is a genuine company name.

Obviously the first two quoted lines are garbled.  In fact, the corresponding
text in the book actually reads:

Some textbooks leave the quantity 0^0 undefined, because the functions
x^0 and 0^x have different limiting values when x decreases to 0.

(Except that it uses proper exponentiation signs.)

I emailed the list's maintainer, Alex Lopez-Ortiz, to point out what I
assumed was a typo.  He replied to say that actually the error was the
result of a bug -- he had used a program to remove LaTeX math formatting
codes from an online copy of the paragraph, and it had apparently shifted
each formula by one position in the text!

<P>
It is not clear that the possibility of emulating hardware in software,
and thus the possibility of creating software that emulates hardware so so
closely as to be subject only to the same failure modes as hardware, says
anything at all about the potential reliability of software in other
contexts.  If I understand things correctly, most hardware is self
referential, intended to do a limited number of clearly specified things
well.  Most software, on the other hand, is directed at a real-world task or
tasks ... which can easily be either incompletely understood or
misunderstood altogether.  It may be the case that what hardware is normally
supposed to do is better understood in the CS world than all the strange
things non computer scientists ask software to do.  If this is the case,
software is less reliable -- not because of the medium, but because a vaguer
definition of, and lesser understanding of, the task to be performed leaves
more room for error.
<P>
Or, the reliability of software is less because the risk of human
error is greater, in the tasks which it is customarily applied to.

Well, I am now one of those whose cellular-phone number was duplicated.
According to AirTouch Cellular, this was discovered when the pattern of
calls using my number changed (from 1-2 minutes a day to 1 hour a day!).
The detection of this type of change is clearly (IMHO) a good use of
technology.
<P>
While talking to the customer service rep, I asked about the risk of digital
phones to the hearing impaired (and their hearing aids) as reported in an
earlier risks.  She said that the European phones were higher powered and
that the American phones, because of their lower power, were safe. I asked
her to ask that this be checked anyway.

MISTRIAL DECLARED IN KANE CARPET CASE, The Record, April 6, 1994; Pg. D03
<P>
Seven months into a jury trial in which the Kane Carpet Co. claimed that it
had gone bust because of a computer, a Superior Court judge has declared a
mistrial.  Judge Mark A. Baber issued the decision this week after Kane's
former president, Richard Lehmbeck, testified that he had suffered a nervous
breakdown affecting his recall of events in 1989, when the computer went on
line; and in 1990, when Kane folded. The onetime Secaucus-based distributor
of floor coverings has claimed that a McDonnell Douglas Corp. computer
system destroyed its business in a few weeks as complaints about incorrect
invoices and duplicate deliveries piled up.  McDonnell Douglas denies any
responsibility for Kane's demise.  The case is expected to be rescheduled
for a new trial.

Australia's proposed crypto policy:
<OL>
<LI>Banks will get key escrow
<LI>Other Australian residents will be forced to use weak crypto
</OL>
Source: talk by Steve Orlowski, Assistant Director, Australian attorney
general's department, given at the Cryptography Policy and Algorithms
Conference, Queensland University of Technology, last month.
<P>p 34: `the needs of the majority of users of the infrastructure for
privacy and smaller financial transactions can be met by lower
level encryption which could withstand a normal but not
sophisticated attack against it. Law enforcement agencies could
develop the capability to mount such sophisticated attacks.
Criminals who purchased the higher level encryption products
would immediately attract attention to themselves.'
<P>
He mentioned that his department considered itself a suitable repository
for the government central decrypting unit, which would decrypt traffic
for local police forces. He also wants to escrowed keys for banks and
other organisations allowed to use strong crypto.
<P>Centralising the wiretap capability with the AG is represented as a useful
safeguard against abuse of power by local police forces. It would be
presented as a `data recovery' facility in order to reassure the voters.
<P>
Centralisation will enable the AG to acquire the capability to use ``more
sophisticated techniques in circumstances where the key cannot, for
whatever reason, be recovered from escrow''.
<P>
So the technical parameters would appear to be: 40 bit keys for the
masses, 56-bit escrowed keys for the banks, and a Wiener machine sitting
in Orlowski's office. Belt, braces and string.
<P>Curiously enough, he quotes a `Review of long Term Cost Effectiveness
of Telecommunications Interception' as saying that ``Encryption by
targets of their communications (both voice and data) is not considered
as a problem for TI at present in Australia'' and goes on to say that
``there has been comparatively little market for voice encryption
products, although they have been readily available''.
<P>
He even produces some good arguments for the EFF, such as that much of
the intelligence comes from the call log data and from calls to third
parties such as airlines and hotels which are not encrypted.
<P>
He also says that the OECD countries will hold a meeting on National
Cryptography Policies later this year. While at the conference, I found
out that a classified meeting took place this March in Germany between
the signals intelligence agencies of the developed countries, plus
Australia and South Africa, at which the assembled spooks agreed to
press their governments to bring in escrow and/or weak crypto.
<P>
Australia seems rather eager to lick Uncle Sam's boots on this issue.
I wonder what the payoff was?

</ADDRESS>
<I>Wed, 9 Aug 1995 12:16:55 EDT</I>
<P>
Prof. David Parnas makes a good point that it would be nice for each of us
to contribute more original success or failure stories and to rely less on
the popular press for our data.  I'd like to expand on this idea, and, in
the future, I will try to contribute some unpublished stories.
<P>
As someone who works for a company that sells fault-tolerant computers, which
are designed never to fail, I've often wondered why failures of our systems
(unfortunately, being human beings, neither we nor our systems are perfect)
aren't reported in the press.  It finally dawned on me that the answer is very
simple: our customers do not want their failures reported.  Failures reflect
poorly on the person who selected or implemented the system, on the department
responsible, and on the business and its image in the marketplace.  Failures
hurt customers and lose business.  (After all, that's why they are buying our
equipment in the first place!)
<P>
If you call a company whose systems are dead on the floor, some may admit it,
but I also know of instances where they have claimed to be "updating their
files" or "on holiday" or almost anything that would get you to go away and
not get angry at them.
<P>
Another aspect of this denial and cover-up is that even when the fault and
responsibility for the failure is clearly within the MIS department, we, the
vendor, will be blamed.  I just have had to learn to accept that aspect of the
computer business.  (We certainly ARE to blame some of the time, but we get
blamed far more times).
<P>
While it is healthy for society as a whole to expect perfection and to not
tolerate failure, we also have to find a way to get society to expect honest
explanations and total ownership of responsibility.  Having worked with
Japanese, European, and American companies, my feeling is that the Japanese
are the best at this, the Europeans are second, and the Americans are far
behind.  All of them will berate you for a failure and want a quick
workaround and a solid fix, but typically only the Japanese want to know
what was the root case of the failure, and what process changes you are
instituting to avoid this problem in the future.  This kind of customer
pressure to "do the right thing" is incredibly helpful within the company
towards ensuring that we understand and truly correct the problems. I wish
more customers did this.
<P>
Total Quality Management (TQM) programs seem to be a pretty good tool for
fixing these problems within a company.  In my personal, everyday life I've
made two small changes to try to help the world at large. One is to refuse
to accept the stock phrase "it was a computer error" when I receive it; the
other is to ask why the failure occurred and what will be done to prevent it
from happening again.
<P>
The end result of this human tendency to cover-up failures, deny
responsibility, and let vendors off too easily is that we are getting
neither the awareness nor understanding (to borrow from Parnas) that is
possible. I'm sure that the press is able to report on only a small fraction
of the actual failures that occur; I'd guess less than 1%. Airline pilots
have a way to report problems anonymously; perhaps we need a similar program
in the systems business.

The FACTS: These stories are NOT TRUE.
<OL>
<LI> A user may choose to register by the paper card, electronically, or not
at all.  It is completely the user's choice.  The online
registration application is an electronic version of the paper registration
card that traditionally comes with all Microsoft products.  The intent is to
offer customers a convenient and helpful way to register.  The registration
application must be explicitly run by the user and the user supplies,
completely on a voluntary basis, similar information that he would with the
paper registration card.  When the user runs the app, it asks for the
typical information, such as name, address, company, as well as system
configuration info for that PC (things such as type of CPU, RAM, hard disk
space, etc.) and what products the user may have installed.  This is done
only with the user's consent and not required to complete the registration.
There is no default answer to the question of whether to include the system
information or not: it requires an explicit Yes by the user.  What's more,
if the user says No to the system info, then the app does not even bother
asking about the product info (and doesn't send it); if the user says Yes to
the system info, then the user is led to the product info screen and has to
explicitly say Yes to it too.
<P>
The app does not send any user info that the user is not aware of and not
explicitly agreed to.  In particular, the app does not send any files such
as config.sys, autoexec.bat, or the registry -- just the info that was on
the screen and that the user said Yes to.
<P>
Nor does the registration application look out on the network.   It only
looks at the PC the app is being run on.
<LI>MSN is involved with the registration application only in that it uses
the MSN transport to upload the registration information.  You
don't have to be an MSN member to register, and once you register you are
not an MSN member.
<LI>MSN does NOT transmit the user's directory structure or file names.  MSN
only uploads the version of the Win95 build and the
language that is being used on the computer, and any other user initiated
information, such as BBS postings and email. MSN uploads the build and
language info so that its on the fly upgrades are synched up with the
version of Win95 on the PC being upgraded and in the right language.  MSN is
not uploading any other information about the user's PC or files.

The Australia and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists is the professional
body regulating training and qualification in anesthesiology in this area.
To become a Fellow of the College trainees take two exams. Each is composed
of three parts: a multiple choice paper, essays, and an oral exam.  The oral
is held some weeks after the written papers. Candidates are told their
results at the end of the day of oral examinations.
<P>
At a recent sitting of the primary exam a number of candidates failed.
"Three or four" (out of an estimated sixty sitting the oral) were
contacted a few days later to be told that they had, in fact, passed.
<P>
The "explanation" they were given was as follows. The exam format had
changed. Instead of three essay questions, there were ten. The essays were
weighted (as before) at 30% of the overall mark. A new computer system (not
specified) was used to calculate the scores. "It" had rounded all figures
down. The unlucky/lucky candidates marks had been rounded below the
pass/fail threshold after division. Rounding was not a problem before, as
the raw essay scores were merely added to the exam total (30 marks max =
30%).
<P>
We look forward to a fuller explanation in the next examiners' bulletin of
how the College came to use such a foolish computer program.

<P>
The Royal Majesty was in _The Boston Globe_ again today (11 Aug 1995). The
explanation given for its being off course is that the GPS antenna failed
and the alarm was not loud enough to alert the crew to switch to Loran. So
it wasn't "our" fault.  The software worked perfectly, and the software
methodology worked perfectly.
<P>
Yeah, sure. The problem is that just churning out code is the trivial aspect
of the problem of designing systems. A much much harder problem is the
ad-hoc integration of disparate systems. Software methodologies do little
good unless we can deal with real-world interactions and unless the system
design takes the right responsibility. Seems like no system really took
responsibility for navigation. Of course, the Captain is responsible, but
that's moot if the subsystems are reliable enough that constantly watching a
perfect system is counterproductive.
<P>
How do we design systems that can take responsibility for component failures
and how to do we get the components to cooperate? We don't have any good
answers. Ironically, if we do manage to get a handle on the integration and
responsibility problems, much of the methodology used to build individual
systems become less important since, theoretically, the individual systems
should become simpler and less critical.
<P>
What work is being done to deal with the issues that arise as systems
interact? There is work being done on component integration and building
standard building blocks but rigid integration is an issue. What happens
when subsystems fail? The problem is that failures are not well-defined..
How does one report a failure that isn't in the semantics of the client? The
more serious problem with failures is that that they tend to occur when
things are going wrong (of course) and thus frustrate attempts towards neat
solutions.  The user of a GPS system might not even realize that there is a
flag that can switch reporting between magnetic and true North? What happens
when the switch flips? (*67 is another example of this (That's implicit
reference, but readers of Risks should recognize the "toggle caller ID"
problem).
<P>
As a long-time reader of RISKS, I see repeated complaints about how systems
are not reliable, but I view reliability as a crutch. The problem is not
assuring that all components are perfectly reliable, but rather delivering a
sufficient service out of unreliable components. Any navigation system is an
unreliable component.
<P>
Sufficient in the case of the Royal Majesty is first assuring that it
doesn't sink and secondly that it gets to the right destination on the right

<P>
This is an interesting point. It brings to mind the issue of regulation and
legal responsibilities of database owners.
<P>
Are there any efforts in the US to make database owners responsible and
legally liable for the accuracy of their data, the access to it, and the
uses of it? Thus, a database owner might be subject to criminal or civil
liability if it contained inaccurate information regarding an individual
(regardless of the purpose of the database); if someone gained unauthorized
access to it or abused authorized access (these might be regarded as failure
by the owner to take adequate security measures); or if someone used that
data to commit a crime.
<P>
One could imagine an all-encompassing scenario where a database record
incorrectly listed a home address, a stalker gains unauthorized access to
the record, goes to the wrong address and murders the wrong victim in the
dark (of course, this might happen just by using the phone book or other
public records, but people know that these records are not always accurate
and up to date, whereas they assume computerized records are). The database
owner might justifiably argue that they cannot be responsible for the
inappropriate use of that data when it is used without their knowledge, but
should be liable on the other two counts. If, on the other hand, the data is
knowingly made available to someone engaged in illegal activity, the owner
should be liable.
<P>
Database owners would probably argue that such liability would be burdensome
and would simply be bureaucratic invasion of their enterprise. The irony of
this argument would probably never occur to them. However, there might be
several benefits to society. First, a database owner who was not diligent in
ensuring accuracy or protection of the data could be held accountable. How
many people's lives have been disrupted, sometimes severely, because some
municipal database couldn't handle someone with the same name? And the
response of the database owner? Gee, we're sorry, maybe you should change
your name. Second, it would be another charge to use against someone engaged
in illegal activity, ensuring that they are punished even if they were able
to evade other charges (remember why Al Capone went to jail?). Third, it
could discourage database owners from storing such detailed data in the
first place, in favor of anonymous systems.  Make it a hassle for them if
they can't justify it.
<P>
Right now massive collection of incidental data takes place because it is so
easy, it just costs storage space, which is cheap. There is no risk in it.
Put some legal risk into it and people will start being a little more
careful, storing only what is truly necessary and keeping a closer eye on
it. An analogy is a financial institution, where people voluntarily give
over access to and control of their funds. What bank would be silly enough
to leave the cash lying out in the open? What bank would stay in business if
they did not take adequate measures to protect that money? What bank would
be permitted to knowingly launder money for illegal activities? If we simply
replace money with information (which is generally already the case in the
age of the plastic card!), we have a good initial model for responsibility
and liability.
<P>
Far be it for me to propose greater bureaucracy, but the apparent total lack
of responsibility of database owners cries out for regulation. I infer from
several items about database abuse in the UK that they require databases to
be registered in some way with the government. I don't know if that has
worked out well or not, but it's not a bad idea when backed up with some
teeth. A database can be a dangerous weapon.

do not want to set off any kind of anti-Fluke stampede.  The facts quoted
below are accurate for the most part.  We did discover this flukey defect
(pun intended) in one of our labs.  Fluke has NOT totally duplicated the
condition at the factory, but they have been able to get the meters to
freeze up under limited conditions.  Meanwhile, we have sent the 2 meters
in question back to the factory for analysis.  I will post the results to
this newsgroup.  I would like to emphasize that thus far, Fluke has been
very cooperative, straightforward and concerned.  Anyone in the business
knows that their meters are top notch.
<P>
By the way, if anyone out there uses these particular meters to test
500-1000 vDC, I would appreciate it if you could do the experiment
described [in the previous message] and forward the results to me.
I will compile and forward to Fluke.  Thanks-

In <A HREF="/Risks/17.24.html">RISKS-17.24</A>, Peter G. Neumann cited a _San Francisco Chronicle_
article that asserted that the Oakland ARTCC covers an area of 18-million
square miles.  This cannot be so, even if the airspace over the eastern
Pacific Ocean is included.  Of course the aircraft at greatest RISK were not
evenly distributed.  Aircraft in the terminal areas in Northern California
and Reno were controlled by the Approach Control facilities or the Control
Towers.  For enroute aircraft, the matter of clear skies could have been
more of a RISK than a help, since there are fewer aircraft (or none)
purposefully flying under Visual Flight Rules when the weather is bad.
<P>
The Airman's Information Manual and Federal Aviation Regulations specify
the procedures to be used for enroute aircraft when radio communication is
lost.  Those procedures are geared toward a problem with one aircraft rather
than with the ARTCC, but, particularly with the abundance of military radar
facilities in California and Nevada, most aircraft should have been able to
establish contact with some other radar-equipped ATC facility.
<P>
[I thought about the seeming absurdity of the 18M-SqMile area when I
first saw it in the Chron, and meant to flag it in <A HREF="/Risks/17.24.html">RISKS-17.24</A> -- but
then forgot.  "Paul M. Karagianis" &lt;<A HREF="mailto:KARYPM@SJUVM.bitnet">KARYPM@SJUVM.bitnet</A>&gt; noted that such
a circle has a radius of over 2393 miles, and I observe that the Page 1
map appears to show a somewhat prolate shape with a pseudoradius of
maybe 250 miles in the artist's conception, or something less than
200,000 square miles.  Off by a factor of 90?  Not bad at all.  PGN]

<P>
In <A HREF="/Risks/17.24.html">RISKS-17.24</A>, Peter Neumann notes the outage at the Oakland
En-Route Air-Traffic Control Center. He reports:
<P>
Fortunately, the weather over northern California was good, and
en-route flights could operate visually.
<P>
A commercial flight is under en-route control, the least demanding flight
regime, when it is not near its airport of take-off or landing.  The
air-traffic control system is designed to be safe in the event of total
communications failure. Airplanes have altitude and routing requirements
(`clearances'), along with information on future expected clearances, along
with precise procedures to follow, that define the entire flight at any
time.  Flight rules require that the FAA guarantee that this space-time slot
is free from conflict.  Controllers lose efficiency significantly under
communications failures by losing the ability dynamically to modify
clearances, but in principle safety is not compromised. It's not clear there
would be any computer-related safety RISK.
<P>
In positive control areas at lower altitude covering airports of take-off
and landing, there may be a risk at the exact moment of outage, since
airplanes are often given partial routing clearance (e.g. `radar vectors')
to sequence them for landing and take-off. No such areas were affected
in this incident.
<P>
The rules allow flights to operate `visually' only below 18,000 feet,
usually attained by a commercial jet within, say, 10 minutes of take-off.
Flights into and out of SFO operate under positive control of the terminal
area controller at and below 12,000 feet, and this control remained
available (I don't have an SFO chart or regs handy -- I believe the positive
control extends to 12,000 feet but I may be mistaken.) Between 12,000 feet
and 18,000 feet, the crew must be looking out of the window to spot and
avoid other planes flying under `visual' rules and not under positive
control. They *must* do this, comm failure or not: the en-route controller
may issue `traffic advisories' but these are not definitive information
about other traffic flying under visual rules. TCAS may help.  These
intermediate altitudes are thus potential `trouble spots' and some thought
has been given to providing some positive-control-only airspace for all
altitudes on the ascent/descent routes in the vicinity of major airports, so
that commercial flights may fly entirely in positive-control-only airspace.
<P>
It may have been more `fortunate' had the weather been bad at the
intermediate altitudes.  Potential conflicts with visual-rules traffic
do not arise where visual flight is not possible.
<P>
Of course, all this presumes that everyone follows the rules.

<P>
While triggered by the news of the Oakland air-traffic control center
outage, hopefully this can give RISKS readers something new to worry about
also.
<P>
Both the article I read in my morning paper, and the item in RISKS regarding
the outage at the Oakland air-traffic control center seemed to indicate that
this was just another example of problems with the aged computers being used
for air-traffic control.
<P>
In this particular case it would not matter what method or equipment was
being used, the outage would have occurred.  The only way to avoid it would
be if the entire air-traffic control center was operated by a strictly
mechanical means, as in with falling water turning wheels and moving levers.
The outage was caused by a LOSS OF POWER (hence the loss of radar and radio
contact, and probably lights also, is not surprising).  The real problem
being poor planning by the designers in making sure of a constant flow of
electricity.
<P>
This hits home because my job is with a public power utility, keeping the
computers going that keep the electricity on.  The power grid across the
country must constantly be kept in "tune", or it will fail.  As people turn
switches on or off, generators must change their output.  As loads go up and
down capacitors and reactors must be switched in and out of the system to
keep power flowing efficiently.  (this is an extreme simplification of
electric power system control).  Each company does this (or has it done by
another utility) by monitoring the power system every few seconds using, you
guessed it, computers.
<P>
While usually nondescript or at least unlabeled, you may have noticed at
times a power company building resembling a small bunker with some
combination of fencing and electronic surveillance.  In other cases the
building may look normal from the outside, but once inside the security
becomes quite apparent.  Their are two reasons for this.  The first is that
the control operation must continue no matter what the weather.  Our
building is designed to take a direct hit by a tornado and not effect the
control room personnel.  The second reason is to keep the bad guys out.  You
could quite easily black out large areas of the immediate control area (to
disable alarm systems and screw up police and other emergency
communications?) and theoretcally pull down the entire grid (eastern or
western) from within one of the control rooms of a larger utility.
<P>
In the past the computer systems have been electronically separated from the
outside world.  As the older systems (ours is late 1960's hardware with 70's
software) are replaced, the tentacles of networking are getting hold.  In
order to insure we do not lose the operation of these systems we start with
multiple computer systems, each of which will take over for the other(s) if
a hardware or software problem arises.  But now I come full circle back to
the air-traffic control center.  Our building has two separate power feeds,
coming from sub-stations and transmission lines located miles apart.  Should
both of these fail, there is a backup generator with many days of fuel.  If
this fails there are two redundant battery UPSs (Uninterruptable Power
Systems) that will each last several hours.  In addition, internal switch
gear (power distribution), and cooling systems are either redundant or sized
such that remaining units can handle the load of a failed unit.  We believe
we have minimized the risk of a power outage inside of the building.  This
is expensive to build and maintain and comes out of your electric bill, but
the alternative would be increased numbers and duration of power outages.
Have you ever tried to live even a few hours, especially in extremes of
weather, without electricity?  Would you like to be flying into an airport
without electricity?  Why did the planners building the air-traffic control
center not think a constant supply of power would be important?
<P>
And finally, why is it that when you have tons of machinery, a lot of highly
volatile fuel and a couple of hundred people going several hundred miles an
hour 40,000 feet in the sky (in direct opposition to gravity and friction),
you are allowed to "remove your seat belt and move freely about the cabin".
But when you are firmly planted on the ground creeping along at less than 10
miles per hour you are sternly warned to "keep your seat belt fastened until
the plane has come to a complete stop".

This is, unfortunately, not true. The only way to tell strong encryption

Politicians love vague phrases like "the needs of the majority..." the
RISK here is that you can make such blanket statements without any

determining the need, you may even be right.

This is the one that confuses me every time I see it (and I have seen

should good crypto immediately attract attention ? Consider the following:
<OL>
<LI> Person has pgp. Encrypts file.
<LI> Person then double encrypts with "approved" crypto.
<LI> Sends file.
</OL>
Now the only way anyone is going to notice is if they routinely decrypt
*everything*.
<P>
Also, this only works because a pgp-encrypted file advertises the fact.
What if Steganography is used ? Message in the lower bits of a JPEG ?
CD-ROM OTP ? Navajo ? or does the proposal include a requirement that
only messages understood by the gov be sent ? Fact is that while it
is fairly easy to separate plain text from "something else", it is very

An article in The New York Times, 14 Aug 1995, by Lawrence M. Fisher
(Software Bug in Motorola Cell Phone Prompts Worldwide Recall) describes a
software bug in one model of Motorola's cellular phone.  Apparently Israelis
tend to keep their cell phones on all the time, because service is only 3
cents a minute.  This resulted in a bug manifesting itself that had not
previously been a problem.  Motorola's Alpha digital phone was introduced in
December, and sporadic problems were reported in Hong Kong in February.
By April, 65,000 Alphas had been distributed in Israel by Cellcom.
Alphas were being blamed for sound quality that made voices inaudible, a
lack of reception in areas where reception was promised, cutting off calls,
and long periods when the phones simply did not work.  The biggest problem
seems to have been that the digital TDMA (time division multiple access)
phones would lock onto one frequency during the periodic registration,
rather than switching; this resulted in blocking all other users in the
local cell.  Motorola wound up recalling 150,000 Alphas in six countries, to
change the software (a job estimated by Motorola as costing between $10
million and $20 million.

On Saturday, 12 Aug 1995, lighting knocked out both the main power and the
backup for almost 1.5 hours at the Miami-area ATC radar center that tracks
400,000 square miles of air space over Florida, the Atlantic, and the Gulf
of Mexico (ok, RISKS readers, that is a radius of about 357 square miles,
assuming a circular area).  ``Travelers were never in danger, said an FAA
spokesman.''  [Source: San Francisco Chronicle, 14 Aug 1995, p. A3.]

&gt; Why did the planners building the air-traffic control<BR>

<P>
They did.  According to the brief CNN story I saw, there were two backup
power supplies.  However, one was down for repairs, and the other didn't
come online automatically like it should have.  When this was realized,
engineers had to start it manually, and this took time.

My guess is that the airspace controlled by Oakland Center was correctly
reported to be 18 million square miles.  The Center is responsible for
controlling traffic over most of the Pacific.  Its airspace includes Guam,
goes almost as far south as Fiji, and further north, more than 2/3 of the
way west from California to Japan.  Dres

A recent post from Ross Anderson via Lance Hoffman and David Farber
contained the following:
<P>
&gt;... says that the OECD countries will hold a meeting on National<BR>
&gt;Cryptography Policies later this year. While at the conference, I found<BR>
&gt;out that a classified meeting took place this March in Germany between<BR>
&gt;the signals intelligence agencies of the developed countries, plus<BR>
&gt;Australia and South Africa, at which the assembled spooks agreed to<BR>
&gt;press their governments to bring in escrow and/or weak crypto.
<P>
I think that it should be noted that these policies are not "national" in
any real sense of that word.  They are not the result of national dialogue.
They are not positions taken by the elected government.  Rather they are the
unchallenged policies of the bureaucracy. These so-called policies are the
positions of the princes, not to say spooks.  They ignore the interests of
the merchants and the bankers, let alone the citizen.  It may already be too
late for elected officials to reassert their authority over the bureaucracy
but we do not yet have to consent to having the language distorted against
us.
<P>
While I am defending the language, the use of the term "escrow" in this
context is intended to sugar coat something that is nothing like escrow.
Historically, escrow has been used to talk about a fiduciary with equal
responsibilities to both parties.  That is very different from these
proposals where the duty of the agent is to act in the interest of one party
without so much as notice to the other.

<P>
Dear Mr. Dasburg:
<P>
The purpose of this letter is to request
<OL>
<LI>detailed information that your computer information and
information-related problem-resolution practices are safe and
effective
<LI>an apology from customer service
<LI>an explanation about what happened to my XXX-XXX-XXX WorldPerks account
<LI>restitution of the miles on that account or equivalent compensation
</OL>
I have a master's degree in computer science, and I work as a
programmer.  I realize that you cannot reveal trade secrets, but as a
customer, I feel entitled to some reasonable amount of information.
<P>
Since 1987, I had a WorldPerks account (#XXX-XXX-XXX).  Because I used
the account infrequently (once or twice a year), I did not keep
written correspondence from Northwest.  Thinking back, I had not
received an account statement for at least 18 months.
<P>
On July 16, 1995, I flew to Chicago on Northwest.  I presented my
WorldPerks card (#XXX-XXX-XXX), and was asked to confirm an address in
Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  I have never been to Milwaukee; I could not
confirm the address.  The Northwest employee told me to call customer
service when I had time.
<P>
I called customer service within a week.  They told me that without
written correspondence from Northwest, I had no option but to open a
new account with zero miles on it.  I was repeatedly told that
XXX-XXX-XXX was not my account, since it had weekly flights from
Milwaukee since 1988.  I agreed that the flights listed were not mine,
but maintained that the account was.  The only proof I have is my dark
blue WorldPerks card with red lettering (photocopy enclosed).  The
customer service representative said that the color is important, as
it indicates when the card was issued.
<P>
I felt accused and shabbily treated by customer service.  It would
have been simple to call me back after someone knowledgeable in
customer records had investigated my case.  Instead, I was treated as
the wrongdoer, repeatedly told the account was not mine, and given the
"only option" of opening a new account.  I opened a new account
#YYY-YYY-YYY.
<P>
Accompanying the overwhelmingly rapid expansion in the use of
information services, companies must develop responsible
problem-resolution capabilities.  It's good business.  Demonstrate
your good business capabilities by satisfying my requests in the first
paragraph of this letter.
<P>
Your customer,
<P>
Dan Frankowski
<P>
P.S.  I am also sending this to the Usenet newsgroup comp.risks, which
has international readership, as an example of the risks of computing.
I will keep them updated with your replies.

<P>
In <A HREF="/Risks/17.24.html">RISKS-17.24</A>, Paul Green suggests that more customers should, when
confronted with a failure by a company they patronize, insist not only on a
fix to the failure, but also on an explanation of the root cause of the
failure and of how it will be prevented in the future.  Perhaps he has had
better experience than I with this approach, but every time I've tried it,
I've been blown off.  I'll give a recent example, which I confess is not
directly related to computer risks, but which I believe illustrates my point
in a useful way.  I am not "changing names to protect the innocent," because
Dell is *not* innocent and has, in my opinion, earned through its actions a
public condemnation of its cluelessness.
<P>
In November of last year, I purchased a Pentium PC (model XPS P90) from
Dell.  I began to follow discussions in alt.sys.pc-clone.dell, and shortly
after my PC arrived, I saw a posting from someone asking what the story was
with the BIOS upgrade for XPS P90 systems.  A Dell representative posted a
response saying that the current BIOS version was A05 and that update disks
had been mailed, via U.S. Mail, to all registered XPS P90 owners.
<P>
I checked, and lo and behold, my system was running BIOS version A04,
despite the fact that Dell had shipped it to me *after* they released
A05.  I never received an update disk from Dell.
<P>
I engaged in a lengthy E-mail conversation with Dell's on-line
technical support department, in which I pointed out that (a) I should
not have been shipped a system with an obsolete BIOS on it, and (b) I
should have received an update disk if my system had an obsolete BIOS,
I was a registered owner, and disks really were mailed to all
registered owners.  I asked for specific explanations of why both of
these failures occurred, and what was being done to fix them, so that
at the very least I would not miss out on any future mailings from
Dell that I was supposed to receive.
<P>
Despite repeated requests, the people with whom I corresponded never
even tried to address point (a) above.  As for point (b), they
continued to insist for quite a while that everyone had been mailed
update disks, and when pushed on the issue, they claimed that either
my address must have been wrong in one of their databases, or the
U.S. Postal Service must have lost some of the disks that were sent
out.
<P>
I pointed out to them that in either of those cases, there was something
wrong that they needed to investigate.  If my address was wrong, then they
needed to find out how it got to be wrong and fix it, because I gave them
the correct address when I ordered the system and it hadn't changed since
then (and I'd received other mailings from Dell with no problem).  If the
Postal Service lost some of their mail, then they had a serious bone to pick
with the Postal Service, and they should demand an investigation and
compensation from the Postal Service.
<P>
Using Occam's Razor, it seems far more likely that rather than any of their
excuses being correct, what really occurred is simply that the switch from
A04 to A05 in manufacturing and the mailing out of update disks to
registered owners were not properly synchronized, so some people received
new systems with the obsolete BIOS after the mailing out of disks to
registered owners had already occurred, or even that they made an error when
mailing out the disks and some registered owners were not included in the
mailing.
<P>
At no time during this stream of correspondence did the people at Dell show
any comprehension of why I considered it important to find the cause of the
problem, rather than just to solve its symptoms.  Several times, they told
me that I could download the BIOS update program from their BBS, FTP server
or WWW server, even though I told them several times that I'd already *done*
that, and that I was trying to get *past* that to find and fix the root
cause of their failure to ship me a current BIOS.
<P>
In the end, I sent a paper letter to the manager of Dell's support
department, relating in it this entire story and suggesting that perhaps he
might want to consider training his employees in simple TQM concepts such as
the one I was trying to get across to them.  I got a response a few weeks
later, informing me that my letter had been received and was being acted on,
and that I would subsequently received a more substantive response to my
complaints.  I never received such a response, and that's where things stand
to this day.
<P>
The treatment I received from Dell is not, in my experience, an isolated
experience.  Almost invariably, when I suggest to someone that I have a
right to know the root cause of a failure, and that finding and providing me
with that root cause will *help* them serve customers better in the future,
I am met with stone-faced resistance of the "Stop telling me how to do my
job" variety.  I do not blame only the employees with whom I have dealt with
for this.  When a company encourages its employees to handle customer
complaints *quickly* (as in, "This call may be monitored to ensure that our
employee gets you off the telephone in the shortest amount of time possible,
so that they can handle more calls per day, so that we don't have to hire
more support people."), as opposed to encouraging them to handle complaints
*well*, taking initiative to ensure that similar problems do not occur in
the future, employees have little choice but to buckle under.  When speed is
rewarded at the expense of everything else, quality suffers.
<P>
TQM isn't the grail of quality customer support.  It has a lot of aspects
that I find silly; I'm certainly not a TQM junkie like some managers (and
companies) I've seen.  Nevertheless, it has some good ideas, and one of the
best is encouraging all employees to treat the root causes of problems
rather than the symptoms.  Alas, I don't know how we can get that message
out effectively.

Oh yes, we got Trouble!

With a capital "T" and that rhymes with "P"
And that stands for Design!  (Poor Design!)
<P>
Landauer has compiled an impressive collection of studies and statistics to
show that computers are not contributing to productivity as they ought.
Liberally sprinkled with computer horror stories occurring to his friends,
family, and self, both anecdotes and academics point out what readers of the
RISKS-FORUM Digest know already--we are using computers the wrong way.
<P>
Over and over again, we see instances of bad design.  Devices and interfaces
that are unusable.  Mission-critical tasks entrusted to insufficiently
reliable machines.  Whole systems viewed only from the output end.  About
halfway through the book, the statement is made that computers are marvelous
toys: this is quite true.  The trouble is that the majority of computer
owners are demanding more frills on their toys, drowning out the faint cries
of those who need more design in their tools.
<P>
Landauer's solution is UCD, an acronym that stands for three variations on
"user-centred design".  This sounds a lot like human factors engineering or,
as we highly technical types refer to it, doing a good job.
<P>
Anyone involved in the implementation or support of technology knows that
bad designs abound, and that more care should be taken to improve usability.
This work does not offer significant help in that direction.

<P>
With regard to the article by Maxion and Goldberg in <A HREF="/Risks/17.22.html">RISKS-17.22</A> about about
the problems with humans interfacing with computers, I have a comment that
is highly unorthodox but which might provide a pathway into the problem.
<P>
Traditional methods (adapted and extended by object-oriented methodologies)
are based on breaking the system into a series of objects, and then
modelling the messages between objects.  Conventional languages such as C
(etc.) are used to implement the system as modelled.
<P>
My belief is that the inheritance of procedural languages based on FORTRAN
or ALGOL is that in choosing to define programming as a series of formulas,
they have also chosen to implement a simplified algebra where the operations
are limited to nouns and verbs, without much support for adjectives and
adverbs.  The result is that simple but powerful parts of thought have to be
broken down before they can be expressed in a program.  A simple example is
a program to select all the "leaf" nodes of a tree: to implement this
simple, powerful, parallel operation typically involves breaking "leaf" into
the test "is_leaf" and then checking each node in a loop.
<P>
Adjectives and adverbs are common in systems, but not at the level of
languages like C: they are found in the command line switches to programs
which modify the behaviour of the program or the set of objects processed by
the program.
<P>
I believe that the freedom to express adjectives in a graphical fashion is
one of the reasons why windowing systems have become more popular than
command-line systems.  Modifiers such as shift-clicking also provide a
convenient way of expressing adverbs.
<P>
My personal goal (which is still a long way off, sigh) is to design and
implement a language where adjectives and adverbs join nouns and verbs as
primitives when presenting an interface to clients.  The process of
constructing a solution to a problem then becomes a process of building a
language in which the solution can be expressed.  Each module that
contributes to the environment also provides an implementation of the
facilities it offers.
<P>
The major reason for having this sophistication in the interface is that it
allows the separation between modules to be much greater than is afforded
now.  This results in improved reuse of the code, which leads to fewer bugs.
The approach also allows more sophisticated concepts used by the programmer
to be captured in the implementation, which results in a clearer and more
maintainable program.
<P>
Another corollary of this idea is scaling: one of the major hurdles to code
reuse is that interfaces appropriate to an 8-bit embedded microprocessor are
not suited to a supercomputer, yet many of the problems being solved are
alike.  Adjectives and adverbs allow efficient requests to be generated,
with the effort required hidden from the interface.  One could easily
imagine a family of implementations for a tree that covered a wide range of
hardware; any user could use the interface equally without caring about the
scale of the machinery underneath.  This is not feasible where the client
has to get involved in the step-by-step processing.
<P>
And finally, the scope offered to implementors of the interface is much
greater where the request is able to be more expressive.  For example, an
interface might offer "node" and "leaf", and have standard routines for
handling requests that include these elements.  However, if "leaf nodes" was
very commonly used, then this pair could be identified in the implementation
and an optimised fragment of code selected.  This optimisation can be kept
entirely hidden from the user.
<P>
As I said before, this is a (slightly) unorthodox point of view;
I hope it is helpful in the research.

<P>
I was very pleased to see that the Risks Forum is now 10 years old, and I
thought a comment would be appropriate on the contents of the tenth
anniversary issue.
<P>
I thought the different viewpoints were interesting and worthwhile, but
I didn't see anything explicit on the two areas that I consider to be
the most important issues we face in the computing community today:
<P>
Integrity and Availability
<P>
I saw several fine articles, including [list deleted by PGN...]
<P>
All of these issues are vital and interesting and the authors gave us well
thought out discussions and/or pointers to useful material.  I commend them
on their efforts, but at the same time, I am deeply concerned that we, as a
community, are scoring magnificent hits on the wrong targets.
<P>
I don't want to take a great deal of time and space in this illustrious and
now scholarly forum to go into a great deal of detail.  I only want to
express that the issues of privacy, perceptions, reliability, and how people
interact with computers will never be fully addressed unless and until we
address the issues of integrity and availability, for meeting each of these
challenges depends on the integrity and availability of information systems
and the information they manage.
<P>
I thank the risks forum for ten years of meaningful discussion, active
participation, and thoughtful exchanges of information.  I hope that the
moderator continues to operate with the same degree of integrity that has
brought this forum so far and that the forum remains available for all of
its readers for many years to come.

<P>
Many customers now routinely purchase products over the Internet using their
World Wide Web (WWW) browsers. Netscape Commerce Server software accepts
orders submitted from a Netscape WWW browser, which are filled out in an
on-line web form and transmitted across the net to the server.
<P>
Using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol, the customer's name, address,
phone number, and credit card number are encrypted with the RC4 algorithm
developed by Ron Rivest of RSA Data Security. Due to export restrictions
placed upon cryptographic software by the U.S. government, the release of
the Netscape software most commonly used is limited to encrypting with a
key only 40 bits in length.
<P>
A recent demonstration strikingly illustrates that this provides insufficient
confidentiality for the task at hand -- maintaining the privacy of credit
card information. After a sample transaction had been executed, and the log
of the encrypted server-browser traffic posted to the net, a private
individual managed to decrypt the transaction information in just 8 days of
CPU time. It would seem that secure commerce on the net, under bureaucratic
constraints, is a risky proposition indeed.

<P>
Late Tuesday evening a person from France posted a news article to the
hacker community claiming success at decrypting a single encrypted message
that had been posted as a challenge on the Internet sometime on or before
July 14, 1994. His response to the challenge is described in an email that
has been forwarded widely across the Internet.
<P>
What this person did is decrypt one encrypted message that used RC4-40 for
encryption. He used 120 workstations and two parallel supercomputers for 8
days to do so. As many have documented, a single RC4-40 encrypted message
takes 64 MIPS-years of processing power to break, and this roughly
corresponds to the amount of computing power that was used to decrypt the
message.
<P>
Important points to understand:
<OL>
<LI> He broke a single encrypted message. For him to break another message
(even from the same client to the same server seconds later) would
require *another* 8 days of 120 workstations and a few parallel
supercomputers. The work that goes into breaking a single message
can't be leveraged against other messages encrypted with other
encryption keys.
<P>
<LI> The standard way to determine the level of security of any encryption
scheme is to compare the cost of breaking it versus the value of the
information that can be gained. In this case he had to use roughly
$10,000 worth of computing power (ballpark figure for having access to
120 workstations and a few parallel supercomputers for 8 days) to break
a single message. Assuming the message is protecting something of less
value than $10,000, then this information can be protected with only
RC4-40 security. For information of greater value, currently available
RC4-128 security should be used.
<P>
<LI> Inside the US, software can support a range of stronger encryption
options, including RC4-128, which is 2^88 times harder to break.
Meaning that the compute power required to decrypt such a message
would be more than 1,000,000,000,000 (trillion) times greater than
that which was used to decrypt the RC4-40 message. This means that
with foreseeable computer technology this is practically impossible.
</OL>
So in conclusion, we think RC4-40 is strong enough to protect
consumer-level credit-card transactions -- since the cost of breaking the
message is sufficiently high to make it not worth the computer time
required to do so - -- and that our customers should use higher levels of
security, particularly RC4-128, whenever possible. This level of security
has been available in the U.S. versions of our products since last April.
Because of export controls it has not been available outside the U.S. We
would appreciate your support in lobbying the U.S. government to lift the
export controls on encryption. If you'd like to help us lobby the
government send email to <A HREF="mailto:export@netscape.com">export@netscape.com</A>.
<P>
Finally, we'd like to reiterate that all this person has done is decrypt
one single RC4-40 message. RC4 the algorithm and products which use the
algorithm remain as secure as always.

COMMERCE'S NIST ANNOUNCES PROCESS FOR DIALOGUE ON KEY ESCROW ISSUES
<P>
Furthering the Administration's commitment to defining a workable key
escrow encryption strategy that would satisfy government and be acceptable
to business and private users of cryptography, the Commerce Department's
National Institute of Standards and Technology announced today renewed
dialogue on key escrow issues.
<P>
A Sept. 6-7 workshop will convene industry and government officials to
discuss key escrow issues, including proposed liberalization of export
control procedures for key escrow software products with key lengths up to
64 bits, which would benefit software manufacturers interested in building
secure encryption products that can be used both domestically and abroad.
<P>
Key escrow encryption is part of the Administration's initiative to
promote the use of strong techniques to protect the privacy of data and
voice transmissions by companies, government agencies and others without
compromising the government's ability to carry out lawful wiretaps.
<P>
In a July 1994 letter to former Rep. Maria Cantwell, Vice President
Gore said that the government would work on developing exportable key escrow
encryption systems that would allow escrow agents outside the government,
not rely on classified algorithms, be implementable in hardware or software,
and meet the needs of industry as well as law enforcement and national
security.  Since that time, discussions with industry have provided valuable
guidance to the Administration in the development of this policy.  For
example, many companies are interested in using a corporate key escrow
system to ensure reliable back-up access to encrypted information, and the
renewed commitment should foster the development of such services.
<P>
Consideration of additional implementations of key escrow comes in
response to concerns expressed by software industry representatives that the
Administration's key escrow policies did not provide for a software
implementation of key escrow and in light of the needs of federal agencies
for commercial encryption products in hardware and software to protect
unclassified information on computer and data networks.
<P>
Officials also announced a second workshop at which industry is invited
to help develop additional Federal Information Processing Standards for key
escrow encryption, specifically to include software implementations.  This
standards activity would provide federal government agencies with wider
choices among approved key escrow encryption products using either hardware
or software.  Federal Information Processing Standards provide guidance to
agencies of the federal government in their procurement and use of computer
systems and equipment.
<P>
Industry representatives and others interested in joining this
standards-development effort are invited to a key escrow standards
exploratory workshop on Sept. 15 in Gaithersburg, Md.  This workshop is an
outgrowth of last year's meetings in which government and industry officials
discussed possible technical approaches to software key escrow encryption.
<P>
The Escrowed Encryption Standard, a Federal Information Processing
Standard for use by federal agencies and available for use by others,
specifies use of a Key Escrow chip (once referred to as "Clipper chip") to
provide strong encryption protection for sensitive but unclassified voice,
fax and modem communications over telephone lines.  Currently, this
hardware-based standard is the only FIPS-approved key escrow technique.
NIST officials anticipate proposing a revision to the Escrowed Encryption
Standard to allow it to cover electronic data transmitted over computer
networks.  Under this revised federal standard, the Capstone chip and other
hardware-based key escrow techniques developed for use in protecting such
electronic data also will be approved for use by federal agencies.
<P>
As a non-regulatory agency of the Commerce Department's Technology
Administration, NIST promotes U.S. economic growth by working with industry
to develop and apply technology, measurements and standards.

Intel and other computer companies are trying to determine the extent of
problems caused by a flaw in an RZ-1000 EIDE controller chip that's included
in some early PCI motherboards manufactured by PC Tech.  The flaw was
discovered in 1994 and was corrected through a software "patch," but the
latest version of OS/2 disables that patch.  (Investor's Business Daily 16

<P>
The following is my rough translation of the article "Die Ampel denkt nicht"
I just read in the German weekly newspaper "Zeit" from August, 11 1995, p.12.
<P>
The "intelligent street" - a foolish flop<BR>
The traffic light does not think
<P>
Stuttgart. - There is no doubt about it, there are intelligent
traffic lights. They do recognize, when to switch from red to
green. Also, an electronic display exhibits intelligence, if it
alerts us about a traffic jam 15 kilometers (km) ahead. Indeed, our
traffic signs become more and more intelligent. We report on an
experiment to replace the common sense of a driver by traffic
signs - a failed experiment, though.
<P>
At April 29th 1995 the federal minister for traffic and
transportation, Matthias Wissmann, and the state minister for traffic
and transformation of Baden Wuertemberg, Hermann Schaufler, pressed
a little green button: The "traffic control (literally influence)
machinery" at the federal street 27 in the south of Stuttgart
started to work. A pilot experiment at a length of 18 km was
supposed to end the brass-age: Instead of stupid speed-limit 80 km/h
signs in the future there will be "variable speed limits" thanks to
"automatic video sequence processing", "radar technology" and
"computer based computational methods". The small group was sure:
this was the advent of the "intelligent road".
<P>
The drivers at this heavily frequented segment got a different
impression the other morning. The DM 14.000.000 equipment suggested
a speed limit of 120 km/h - during a traffic jam. And during the way
home at the evening the super device surprised onece again: It did
rain cats and dogs, which triggered the highly sensitive sensors to
announce "wet street".
<P>
The obvious flop made the ministry of traffic and
transportation to stick red crosses over the displays. At July 19th
started the second trial. Since then it is allowed to race. Where in
former times a speed limit of 80 km/h was in effect for noise and
emission reduction, the computer did allow 120 km/h, in non urban
areas there was no speed limit at all. Some days ago a
vespa-driver fell down, causing a jam, but the "light fiber optical
traffic sign" did suggest 120 km/h. Fortunately, the drivers thought it
over and did brake. Police and city authorities stopped the
madness. Due to their protests, the installation displays constantly
100 km/h in the city area.
<P>
There is a saying around Stuttgart: "With 40 the Swabian
becomes sensible, others not in eternity". Why should a traffic
installation make a difference.
<P>
Phillip Mausshardt
<P>
This "translation" is not to be considered as a contribution to the
intellectual heritage of this century (due to my limited ability to use the
English).
<P>
There are, however some reports on successfully installing such
devices, namely by Kuehne et. al., e.g. in:
<P>
Kuehne, R.D. and Roediger, M.B. Macroscopic simulation model for
freeway traffic with jams and stop-start waves. In: Proceedings of the
1991 Winter Simulation Conference, pp 762-770
<P>
For the interested (and German reading), I can provide more references.
I do not know, however, which research team was involved with the
traffic control system described above.

all kinds of data over a lifetime.  Apart from the problem of bad guys
getting access, it is rather difficult for us to retrieve our own data.  In
addition to stale f.f. accounts, we may need to get tax records, Social

cost, etc., sometimes back to day zero.
<P>
Dave Gelernter at Yale has developed a "lifestream" database model which
would capture and organize (by date, as I understand it) all your electronic
data, starting with your birth certificate.  In addition to all your
financial transaction data, there would be all your e-mail, significant
images, school homework, all the versions of all the programs you ever
wrote, etc.  We can imagine carrying this all around on an optical disk in
your wallet or on a super smart card.  (How much of it should be accessible
to other parties like the IRS or to legal subpoena is an interesting
question.  Encryption might be a good idea, if you can remember a key
throughout your whole life!)
<P>
I don't know if a comprehensive personal "lifestream" is going to be
available any time soon, but the technology is almost there.  As a concept,
it may help to sharpen our ideas about electronic risks.  It certainly
would help to find that old account number.

Dell specializes in selling inexpensive computers.  Customers who want the
cheapest hardware are going to have to face some extra risks, such as the
chance of failing to be notified about a buggy BIOS.
<P>
Few software companies provide toll-free support, but I don't think this is
necessarily bad.  I would often prefer paying $50 for a program with minimal
support over spending $100 for the same program with better support.  Books,
third parties, toll- call support, etc. can provide support if I don't mind
paying slightly more.
<P>
There are risks everywhere, and we have to decide how much effort and money
to invest in avoiding them.  In the case of the PC clone industry, there are
many suppliers and the market is extremely competitive, so consumers can
decide whether the risks associated with choosing a low-cost supplier are
worth taking.
<P>
Don't get me wrong; I'm not recommending that market forces set safety
standards, but I also don't think it's necessarily bad that companies cut
some corners in order to provide more competitive prices.

<P>
[Below is an article, forwarded with the authors permission. The risks are
obvious. I wonder how the risks can be reduced.  Andy Chesterton]
<P>
As most of us are aware, the commercial online services, such as AOL,
Compuserve and Prodigy, represent certain risk to the unsophisticated user.
Unfortunately, the Microsoft Network (MSN) raises the vulnerability of such
users to unprecedented heights.
<P>
Key to this vulnerability is the richness and complexity of the MSN/Windows
95 environment.  What is most dangerous is the ability for the author of an
e-mail or (certain) BBS documents to embed "objects" in that document. These
objects can be readily disquised to appear totally benign to the casual user
and be nothing more than MSN navigational aids.  Once double-clicked by the
recipient, these objects can readily infect the recipient's PC with a virus.
Worse, what this object could do is only limited by one's imagination.  It
is worthwhile noting that MSN appears to be migrating to an open
architecture, with the MSN user connecting through the Internet.  If this is
true, there is nothing which prevents an object, once activated, from
transmitting information stored on the user's PC to any other location on
the Internet.
<P>
In theory, embedded objects can be interrogated to ensure their validity.
Unfortunately, this interrogation process is not likely to be carried out by
the average user.  Even if it is, the user is not likely to understand what
they are looking at.  It is like warning automobile drivers to look under
the hood of their car before starting it to make sure there is not a bomb
inside.  Most drivers would assume that the odds were with them.  Those that
did check would have no idea what they were looking at.  (At least that's my
feeling when I look under the hood of my car :-).
<P>
Microsoft's position appears to be that the MSN user is no more vulnerable
than one who uses a competing system.  I would maintain that this position
is just not true.  With system complexity comes excessive vulnerability.
MSN rates a 9 in complexity.  The other services a 4.
<P>
The bottom line: Users of MSN are placing themselves at significant risk.
If one must use MSN, avoid at all cost activating (double-clicking) objects
in e-mail messages and BBS posts.  Sophisticated users may think they know
what they are doing, but it probably won't be long before they are outwitted
by someone who figures out how to totally disguise an object's true purpose.

It strikes me reading these articles on RISKS that someone has confused two
Microsoft products.  Microsoft SMS (Systems Management Server) collects
information about the machines on a corporate network to aid administration.
In particular, it collects autoexec.bat and config.sys files, and identifies
"packages" installed on the machines (these packages and how they're
recognised is configured by the administrators).
<P>
I'd guess that someone's been reading too many press releases and blurred
the Windows 95 Registration Wizard with the SMS inventory.  One of the risks
of having so much advertising material flying around...

&gt;       The reason for the interest in the effects of the Internet and VR<BR>
&gt; technology is simply that they are unknown.  People are reporting problems<BR>
&gt; with "Internet addiction", and as an old gamer I can see where there might<BR>
&gt; be a problem with people preferring VR flight simulators to their real<BR>
&gt; lives.
<P>
One thing that has been happening throughout history is that the sorts of
activities considered to comprise people's "real lives" have changed, over
and over again. How would a hunter-gatherer or a primary farmer or a medieval
villein or a monk view our "real lives" today?
<P>
Except for a minority we're pretty much out of touch with nature, with the
divine, even with our livelihood. We don't hunt, harvest, butcher, or otherwise
gather or process our own food. Hardly any of us engage in daily prayer. I
assume that most readers of this forum don't believe in the literal truth of
our scriptures the way people did only a few hundred years ago.
<P>
By the standards of most of history, we're hopeless technology addicts today.
<P>
We shouldn't be so quick to judge people who prefer VR to their "real lives".
<P>
How real is *your* life? I know when we've got a project in house my life six

&gt; To see why, consider the history of nineteenth-century railroading.
<P>
And it was also apparent how to avoid a large part of the problem.  Use
broader gauge tracks -- move the rails farther apart -- in relation to
width the cars.  In Britain, the Great Western Railway was built with
tracks of 7' or 7'0.25" (2134-2140 mm) gauge, where others chose the
4'8.5" (1435 mm) that soon afterward became the standard.  But the GWR's
passenger cars were almost the same width as their competitors'.  When
involved in a derailment or collision, they almost always *stayed upright*
-- so unless the car was actually smashed, people would not likely be
trapped inside it.
<P>
Of course, there is no computer relevance whatever to this story of a
system that was technically superior in safety and other respects, but
which lost out to one that was more common and cheaper.

Periodically I will remind you of TWO useful digests related to privacy, both
of which are siphoning off some of the material that would otherwise appear in
RISKS, but which should be read by those of you vitally interested in privacy
problems.  RISKS will continue to carry general discussions in which risks to
privacy are a concern.
<UL>
<LI>The PRIVACY Forum is run by Lauren Weinstein.  He manages it as a rather
selectively moderated digest, somewhat akin to RISKS; it spans the full
range of both technological and non-technological privacy-related issues
(with an emphasis on the former).  For information regarding the PRIVACY
Forum, please send the exact line:
<P>
information privacy
<P>
as the first text in the BODY of a message to
"<A HREF="mailto:privacy-request@vortex.com">privacy-request@vortex.com</A>";
you will receive a response from an automated listserv system.  To submit

and World Wide Web via: "<A HREF="http://www.vortex.com">http://www.vortex.com</A>".
<P>
<LI>The Computer PRIVACY Digest (CPD) (formerly the Telecom Privacy digest) is
run by Leonard P. Levine.  It is gatewayed to the USENET newsgroup
comp.society.privacy.  It is a relatively open (i.e., less tightly moderated)
forum, and was established to provide a forum for discussion on the
effect of technology on privacy.  All too often technology is way ahead of
the law and society as it presents us with new devices and applications.
Technology can enhance and detract from privacy.  Submissions should go to
<A HREF="mailto:comp-privacy@uwm.edu">comp-privacy@uwm.edu</A> and administrative requests to
<A HREF="mailto:comp-privacy-request@uwm.edu">comp-privacy-request@uwm.edu</A>.
</UL>
There is clearly much potential for overlap between the two digests, although
contributions tend not to appear in both places.  If you are very short of time
and can scan only one, you might want to try the former.  If you are interested
in ongoing detailed discussions, try the latter.  Otherwise, it may well be
appropriate for you to read both, depending on the strength of your interests
and time available.<P><ADDRESS>

Court documents were unsealed on 18 Aug 1995 that implicated Russian
computer hackers in about 40 transfers totalling more than $10 million from
the Citibank electronic funds transfer system, between June and October,
1994.  The hackers were caught as they were trying to move $2.8M.  The bank
indicated only $400,000 was actually transferred -- which at first reading
would seem to contradict the $10 million figure, except for the fact that
Citibank noted that none of its clients lost any money, and that all of the
transfers were either blocked or reversed.  Six people have been arrested.
24-year-old Vladimir Levin (who worked for AOSaturn, a Russian software
house, and who is currently under arrest in London) apparently had figured
out how to get around or through the Citibank security system.  [Source: An

Radio communications between pilots and air-traffic controllers vanished for
one minute on 11 August 1995 (until the backup system could be engaged),
over a 200,000 square-mile area including all of Washington state and parts
of Oregon, California, Nevada, Montana, and Idaho.  This problem resulted
from a software glitch in a 2-mont-old $1.4 billion computer system at the
regional center in Auburn, Washington, and was disclosed on 16 Aug.  [This
relatively minor outage follows on the much more major problems in Chicago
(<A HREF="/Risks/17.21.html">RISKS-17.21</A>), Fremont (<A HREF="/Risks/17.24.html">RISKS-17.24</A>), and Miami problems (<A HREF="/Risks/17.26.html">RISKS-17.26</A>).]

I read an article on Medicare in the 20 Aug 1995 _Austin American-Statesman_.
The article was evidently done for the Cox Newspaper chain.  The article
talks of the deterioration of the service, and also touches on that fact
that a handful of doctors earn a disproportionate share of Medicare funds
paid out.
<P>
The article has a sidebar, which says, in short: Cox analyzed 100 million
computerized Medicare payment records for the report.  The information was
obtained via FOIA.  The doctors names were not released.  Evidently there is
an ongoing court case to release the doctors' names.  Cox was able to
identify some of the doctors.  The doctor's id codes were obscured by
Medicare, but the 9 digit zip codes of the doctor's offices were not.  Cox
was able to pinpoint individual doctors given this level of detail.
<P>
Risks: If information needs to be split into private and public components
then care needs to be taken for the job to be done correctly.  9-digit zip
codes divide the US into fairly small areas and so can (and have) given away
the store.
<P>
This is not to say that I think this Medicare information should be kept
secret.  However, 9 digit zip codes in databases can be used to pinpoint all
sorts of details about folks.

<P>
Leveson has produced a thorough and broadly-based overview of the
literature, structures, and models of system safety.  Throughout, there is a
strong awareness of human factors and the human-machine interface (HMI).
There is also mention of the social, political, and economic forces driving
or impeding safety considerations.  Several studies cited indicate the
counter-intuitive result that safety is not a cost of production, but,
rather, that it actually improves performance.
<P>
Despite the title, and some sections specifically directed at software,
there is some difficulty in relating much of the material to the software
development process.  As Leveson, herself, points out, software design and
programming is generally unresponsive to engineering models of risk
assessment and quality control.  Those chapters with "software" in the title
show a marked decrease in citations.  (This undoubtedly represents the
actual state of the art, rather than any lack of research.)
<P>
(One micro-peeve is that although the bibliography has hundreds of entries,
the examples are limited to a few dozen, with a handful reiterated
throughout the book.  These detailed case studies are quite clear, but
additional incidents might have made the material both more interesting, and
more convincing.  Again, the examples have relatively little to do with
software.)
<P>
This is a very realistic analysis of the current state of risk assessment
and management, and of the social activity in relation to it.  The book
shows a society surrounded by accidents waiting to happen.  There are,
however, some directions which indicate hope for a safer future.

Postscriptum: Leveson has seen the draft of this review, and was surprised
at my statements regarding the lack of specific application to the software
development process and the limited number of examples.  While the points
she raised in her response are very important, I still find that my
impression of the book is unchanged.  However, this is only my opinion, and
based on subjective feelings.  I would like to repeat that the work itself
is of the highest quality, and useful to anyone concerned with developing
safe products.

<P>
Rob, Thank you very much for your very nice review.  I do have a question
on two parts, though, that I don't really understand.
<P>
Despite the title, and some sections specifically directed at software,
there is some difficulty in relating much of the material to the
software development process.
<P>
I'm a little surprised by this.  Part 4 (pages 225-500 of the main text) is
all about the software process except for one chapter on hazard analysis in
general, and there is a 40-page chapter on the software and system safety
process along with another chapter on management that includes process
information.  In addition, the first part of the chapters on software
requirements, software design, human-computer interface design, and software
verification of safety are devoted to the process related to that aspect of
development and how safety affects it.  Is there some part of the software
development process that I left out?  I purposely did not lay out one
process because one process does not fit every project.  Instead, I tried to
provide enough information that people could tailor the general process I
describe to fit their particular environment, project, personnel, and degree
of risk.
<P>
(One micro-peeve is that although the bibliography has hundreds of
entries, the examples are limited to a few dozen, with a handful
reiterated throughout the book.  These detailed case studies are
quite clear, but additional incidents might have made the material
both more interesting, and more convincing. Again, the examples
have relatively little to do with software.)
<P>
I also am unclear about what you meant here.  I have hundreds of software
examples throughout the book: I use all the known and documented software
examples about which anyone has any real information.  Peter Neumann's book
has a few more, but many of these are unrelated to safety (many are security
and privacy-related).  I have some that are not included in any of the other
recent books.
<P>
Because of my fear of doing harm (I waited 15 years to write this book
because I was worried that I might say something that might endanger
people), I did not include anything in the book for which I do not have
substantial evidence.  I read over 500 books and papers on safety and
engineering over the 7 years it took me to write this book, talked to
hundreds of engineers who build such systems, and worked myself on dozens of
safety-critical software projects in many different industries.  My fear of
doing harm is partially the reason for excluding rumored accidents that have
not been investigated or documented by someone who participated on the
project.  Chapter 3 includes a lot of evidence from the social science and
safety literature that shows that accidents are often blamed publicly on the
wrong factors for various psychological, sociological, and political
reasons.  There is agreement and carefully documented evidence on this
misattribution phenomenon.  And stories taken from newspapers are written by
reporters who are under time pressure to produce news immediately and not
wait six months for an investigation of what really happened.  Most of what
I have read in some recent books, bboards, and newspapers about accidents
that I am personally familiar with has been incorrect.  Misleading and wrong
information can be more dangerous than no information.
<P>
Perhaps the confusion arises from the appendices.  These were included only
because describing the better-known and researched accidents (about which we
have enough information to really learn something) in the main text would
have required people already familiar with these accidents, particularly
safety engineers, to have to wade through a lot of pages unnecessarily.
However, software engineers probably know little about them and need the
information to understand some of the text.  These well-researched accidents
are mentioned a lot in Chapters 3 and 4 on the general causes of
accidents---including organizational and managerial factors and human
error---because they are the only ones we have adequate information about
with respect to these particular factors.  The computer-related accidents
are spread throughout the book and not included in the appendices (aside
from the Therac-25) because everything we know about them can be described
in a paragraph or two.
<P>
A reason for using non-computer related accidents is that they provide
important information about what needs to be done when computers are
substituted for analog controllers.  Virtually all system safety engineers
agree that software-related accidents are not any different than those in
which computers are not used---software engineers are causing the same
accidents that other engineers learned how to avoid years ago.  They (and I)
feel that unless the software engineers learn those basic safety concepts
that have been accumulated over decades by engineers, we are going to repeat
the accidents of the past and kill thousands of people unnecessarily.

The experience with Dell brings to mind my experience a number of years back
with a bank when I did in fact receive a coherent explanation for a strange
entry on an annual mortgage statement.  I suspect that their DP manager must
have found it very difficult to write the letter that identified the cause
of the strange numeric entry as the result of having specified the account
number rather than one of the dollar quantities in a formula!

The risk: longwinded COBOL variable names, I suspect.

Since I own one of these motherboards, I'm interested in this
bug.  I'm still trying to find out the exact details of the
failure mode.
<P>
However, the description quoted above doesn't quite reflect what's really
going on.  The workaround was a BIOS upgrade (which had the effect of
disabling some performance-enhancing feature in the RZ1000; this therefore
doesn't mean my criteria for "correcting" the flaw, but perhaps I'm just
fussy).
<P>
Naturally, changing the disk BIOS has no effect on operating systems that
don't use the BIOS for disk I/O.  I think this is what they mean by OS/2
"disabling" the patch, but their choice of words somehow seems to be blaming
OS/2 rather than the maker of the buggy board.

M.E. Kabay cited a lesson of the Randal "Perl" Schwartz conviction:
<P>
Comments from MK: Another story confirming the old principle that you do
NOT attempt to improve security by busting it without getting _written_
authorization from an appropriate officer of the organization.  This is
known as the CYA principle.
<P>
That's a starting point for debate in Usenet news that is extrapolating from
this case.  Two questions have been most interesting to me, as a person with
increasing LAN and Internet access admin responsibility.
<UL>
<LI>Under what circumstances should computer administrators go beyond their
authorized boundaries before consulting?  One participant cited an "act then
inform" example.  A glaring rlogin security hole that made his employer's
machines all dangerously vulnerable was being widely publicized online on a
weekend.  Going well beyond his explicit boundaries, he used the hole to
disable remote access to every machine he could reach, then informed others.
Is this felony unauthorized alteration and misdemeanor unauthorized access?
Does it risk too much accidental damage to tolerate?  Or is it a "clear and
present danger" that a professional is obligated to react to immediately?
What if the consultation happens first but the person consulted is
insufficiently concerned?
<P>
<LI>Which approach is preferable for corporate computer security: having
rigid, rigorous procedures or having inquisitive (but skilled) personnel
roam freely in search of the unexpected?  One possible view of Schwartz's
actions and statements is that he was doing the latter as an inferred part
of his duties, but afterward being held up to the standards of the former.
The debate has involved fans of both approaches; surely the organization and
worker must agree on when to use which.
</UL>
Some asked a speculative question specific to this case, without seeing the
court testimony: is a computer crime law being misapplied to punish
transgressions within a company, when the law's primary intent must have
been to deter and punish thieves, spies, and damagers?  If there is an
element of this present, is there now a greater personal risk of exposing
computer security risks in one's company?  If so, too many professionals
could infer that the lesson from this case is MYOB rather than CYA.

<P>
... Dave Gelernter at Yale has developed a "lifestream" database model
which would capture and organize all your electronic data, starting
with your birth certificate.  ...
<P>
There is no clear distinction between relevant data (to be included) and
irrelevant data (to be excluded).  Instead there is a gradation from vital
information to utterly useless junk.  If one has a rare medical problem, it
may be very important to know the medical histories of parents and
relatives.  Thus any drugs my mother took are an important part of who I am,
so my "lifestream" begins even before my birth certificate.  If my house is
discovered to be in a geologically unstable area, repair records before I
bought the house may be important in deciding whether or not to take
preventive measures.  The history of those that did the repairs may be
important, too.  But I doubt I'll ever need to know who the lead drummer for
the Eagles was.
<P>
Attempting to have all of one's data in one place will not be a
breakthrough: either everything will be included, in which case storage is
problematic and finding pertinent information will be hard, or there some
items will be left out, in which case it must be tracked down in outside

One message emphasizes the break; another emphasizes how much work went into
it.  While not expecting absolute security, I feel that the second
underestimates the value of even a single credit-card number, and
overestimates the difficulty.  Optimize the cracking process, build
bit-slice hardware dedicated to the purpose, and the cost (and time) will
come down; flood out a few hundred orders on a stolen credit card, and if
even half of them get delivered you win.  Not to mention the inconvenience
to the true cardholder.
<P>
Just picture the fun of having some random hacker break your message (even
if he has to leave his computer on for a few weeks), order a few thousand
dollars worth of stuff on your credit card, and POST YOUR NUMBER on the
local BBSs.  You'll be cleaning up the paperwork for the next year.
<P>
No, thanks.  I get nervous enough giving my number to these people anyway,
having had a problem with a dishonest employee at a mail order house use my
[among many others] number improperly.  The last thing I want to do is ship
it over a medium which goes through an unknown number of other people's
systems on the way.

<P>
This type of cost analysis is only valid *if* the user of the computing
power has to make a tradeoff between using it for this purpose and other
useful work.    If these machines would otherwise be idle, this computing
power is virtually free (imagine if everyone ran RC4-40 cracking software
instead of screen savers...).  Also, how much cheaper does the computing
power get if you allow, say 30 days to crack a message?  How much cheaper
is the computing power going to be next year or the year after that
(assuming the data still retains its value; more on this below)?
<P>
How valuable are credit card numbers?  A reasonable assumption could be
the credit limit on the card.  My credit limit per card is certainly well
within the ballpark of the $10K cost you associate with cracking a
message, and I would guess that most non-students who have the equipment
to surf the Internet have a similar amount of credit available.
<P>
The other aspect to determining the level of security needed is the
duration that the information retains its value.  My primary credit card
has had the same number for the last five years, and I don't see it
changing in the foreseeable future, barring someone else "stealing" it.
This, combined with credit limits usually going up over time, makes this
data valuable *indefinitely*.
<P>
&gt;   3. Inside the US, software can support a range of stronger encryption<BR>
&gt;      options, including RC4-128, which is 2^88 times harder to break.
<P>
Irrelevant.  How many sites on the Internet are going to want to deal with
US-only transactions?
<P>
The other question to ask is who exactly is assuming the risk:  Netscape,
Visa, or consumers directly?

<P>
In "Netscape Security" (RISKS 17.27) Peter Shank argues that RC4-40
is currently adequate for $10,000 dollars worth of security, because
that is approximately how much it costs to crack the encryption.
<P>
Unfortunately for that argument, compute power tends to get cheaper over
time.  Using an arm-waving rule of thumb of 2x more MIPS per dollar per
year, RC4-40 might be "trusted" for protection over time as follows:
<P>
1995 $10,000<BR>
1996  $5,000<BR>
1997  $2,500<BR>
1998  $1,250<BR>
1999    $625
<P>
$5,000 credit limits are not uncommon.  So it seems that very soon
RC4-40 won't be secure enough to really trust with credit card numbers.
<P>
The RISK to me seems to be neglecting the relentless exponential growth in
compute power when doing encryption/security analyses.  I imagine the
costs of picking an inappropriate standard method and then changing it could
be significant.

a single decryption is a break-even proposition today, tomorrow it will be

Ross Anderson posted a message on the net recently stating that Australia
was proposing an encryption policy that would force residents to use weak
cryptography while banks would get key escrow.  His source was a talk by
Steve Orlowski, who is Assistant Director, Security Management, in the
Australian Attorney-General's Department.
<P>
Attached is a copy of an open letter by Mr. Orlowski in response to
that post.  He is not proposing that individuals be forced to use weak
encryption.  Key escrow would be an option available to anyone wanting
a high level of encryption.  Organizations and individuals could escrow
their own keys if desired.
<P>
This message and his letter may be forwarded.

Dear ,
<P>
Thank you for your comments on the subject of the use of encryption by
private individuals.
<P>
Firstly I would like to make the point that the debate has arisen from one
person's interpretation of a paper I gave at a conference on ``Cryptography
Policies and Algorithms.'' The full text of that paper is now available on
the net at
<P>
<A HREF="http://commerce.anu.edu.au/comm/staff/RogerC/RogersHome.html">http://commerce.anu.edu.au/comm/staff/RogerC/RogersHome.html</A>
<P>
The paper carries a disclaimer at the top that the views are mine and do not
necessarily represent the views of the Australian Government.  The paper
sets out the Government's policy on telecommunications interception, which
includes the issue of the use of cryptography as: ``As a result of the
Report, Australia is, among other TI issues, monitoring the impact of
encryption in the telecommunications interception area and will re-examine
matters in 1997 following the opening of the telecommunications area to full
competition.''  Telecommunications covers both voice and data
communications.
<P>
The last paragraph of the paper says that there is a need to expand the
cryptography debate to cover the needs of individual users in the context of
the information superhighway rather than current Internet users.  The paper
also points out that issues suh as cost, convenience and public confidence
in cryptography systems will be the main issues.  Public confidence is
explained in terms that as long as it meets the general requirement for
privacy it will be acceptable.  I still maintain that the general user of
the superhighway in the next century will be satisfied with a lower level of
encryption which will meet that and cost and user friendliness requirements.
<P>
On specific point made in the Internet message, the paper does not suggest,
either directly or by implication, that individuals should be banned from
using encryption.
<P>
Regarding the use of higher-level encryption, the paper supports the concept
of commercial key escrow where organisations hold their own keys but may be
required to provide them in response to a court order.  The same would apply
to individuals who could either hold there own keys or store them with a
commercial body.  Access to those keys would be by court order and in that
respect is no different to existing procedures for the interception or
seizure of telephone conversations or paper records.  There is no suggestion
that these basic principles, and protection of individual's rights in
general, should be changed.
<P>
If individuals were to use lower level encryption there would be no need for
them to maintain copies of any keys for such systems.  To my mind this is
preferable to a requirement for keys to be maintained for all encryption
systems, which could be the result if universal key escrow were introduced.
<P>
Finally on the question of interception, the general public expects a
reasonable level of law enforcement to ensure the protection of their person
and property.  Governments are required to find a balance between this and
the rights of individuals to privacy.  Part of this balance is to ensure
that law enforcement authorities convince a court that there is a need to
carry out an interception.  There is no suggestion that this fundamental
approach should be changed.  The paper certainly does not suggest tha the
Attorney-General's Department should become a centralised interception
authority.  In fact such a role would not be consistent with its role as a
source of advice to Government.
<P>
I hope the above clarifies both the Government's policy and my personal
views on these matters.
<P>
I consider this to be an open letter and have no objection to it being
used as such.
<P>
Yours sincerely

According to the 25 August 1995 edition of the St. Louis (MO) Post-Dispatch,
a local CompUSA store took the unusual step of staying open late for the
release of Windows 95.  Unfortunately, the cash registers crashed at
midnight, just as the first Windows 95 buyers were ready to check out.  The
store worked half an hour to resolve its problem.
<P>
The article did not say what cause the cash registers to crash; however, I
am sure members of RISKS can speculate.  My guess is that the cash register
system needs to be cycled off at the end of the day and on at the beginning
of the next.  As they never before stayed open after midnight, they did not
know this (nor did they RTFM).
<P>
Even a reliable system will produce unusual results when used in an unusual
manner.

<P>
In an August 13 article in "Nice-Matin" -- the daily newspaper of Nice
(France) -- Alain Ponzanelli is quoted as saying (my translation):
<P>
"I was caught like a fly in a spider's web, trapped by a barrier
that came down in front of my car like an executioner's axe.  I was
badly frightened.  And I had to back up on the turnpike, risking an
accident, to get out of the trap."
<P>
The A8 autoroute (turnpike) has toll plazas at intervals on the highway, and
the one in question, like some others, has a high-speed lane for cars
equipped for "telepayment" by a badge mounted on the lower left interior of
the windshield and validated by a sensor in the telepayment lane marked by
lights.
<P>
M. Ponzanelli drove into the telepayment lane of the Saint-Isidore toll
plaza prepared to slow down for the sensor, but to his surprise the
normally-open barrier before the sensor closed ahead of him.  He was able to
veer off into the emergency turnoff lane to his right, where another
normally-open barrier closed ahead of him.  At this point he was trapped,
not even yet at a place where he could pay by cash and proceed.  (The
article includes a photograph of the lanes and their barriers.)  He shouted
and sounded the horn, but no one came to help, and he had to back up on the
highway to where he could go forward again to a cash payment lane.
<P>
According to unnamed autoroute employees interviewed by Nice-Matin,
apparently the computer that controls the telepayment lanes "mixed up" what
it was supposed to do with its barriers.  One of them said that "electronic
chips don't tolerate heat too well".  Another said "These incidents happen
very seldom.  It could be an equipment problem or a problem with badges."
<P>
There is no question that M. Ponzanelli holds a valid badge: he is
subscribed for at least the whole month.  From the photograph it appears
that the first barrier that closed ahead of him is well before the sensor,
and is intended to close off the lane entirely when the telepayment system
isn't operating.  Finally, although it's true that electronics may be
sensitive to excessive heat, heat is hardly a rare phenomenon in summer on
the Cote d'Azur, and it's difficult to believe that the deployment of the
electronics doesn't account for that.

<P>
The Stuttgart experience described in <A HREF="/Risks/17.27.html">RISKS-17.27</A> reminds me of another
failed experiment with "intelligent" road systems. In the late eighties the
Victorian Road Traffic Authority (RTA) managed to get funding for an
elaborate trial system for "suggesting" drivers change speed to allow
uninterrupted travelling, justified on the basis of potential fuel savings.
<P>
About 18 (I am not sure of the exact number) overhead signs were erected on
Canterbury Road, that is a main street leading from the eastern suburbs into
the city of Melbourne, that has many delays during the peak periods. The
signs were all connected via modem to the RTA's traffic management system,
and would advise motorists to travel at a suggested speed up to the speed
limit or be prepared to stop. The first morning lead inevitably to a number
of head to tail accidents, as I believe that the system did not account for
traffic conditions, merely the status of the traffic lights ahead so that if
you travelled at the recommended speed you could hit a stationary car in
front of you.
<P>
The system was also very useful for telling drivers when to exceed the speed
limit, as the sign would change from the 60 km/h speed limit to "prepare to
stop", and with only a little intelligence on the part of the driver, it was
soon obvious that if you went faster then 60 km/h you would make the lights.
In fact this was the only use for the system, as the delays still occurred and
the signs were soon ignored by drivers, except when in a hurry to race the
lights.
<P>
Needless to say, the trial system was abandoned and all of the signs removed.

<P>
Last week, my wife and I received two mailings on the same day from
AT&amp;T Universal Card.  One of them contained new cards for both of us,
and the other contained an updated cardmember agreement and a fluff
letter.
<P>
The last line of the address on the mailing containing the new cards
said "JERUSALEM 93393 ISRAEL".  The last line of the address on the
other mailing said "Jerusalem, CA".  Other than that, the two
addresses were identical (ignoring case).
<P>
Note that Israel uses five-digit postal codes similar to American ZIP
codes, and that the Israeli postal code 93393 looks a lot like an
American ZIP code for California.  I don't actually know whether that
exact ZIP code exists in California.
<P>
It seems that there are at least two different programs involved in
addressing mailings from AT&amp;T Universal Card.  One of them was
programmed by someone who remembered to take into account the
possibility of international addresses, and the other wasn't.  I just
hope that the program that addresses our statements is the one that
addressed the new cards, not the one that addressed the other mailing.
<P>
I'm going to write to the AT&amp;T Universal Card people and ask them to
find out what the story is and fix it.  If their response is of
interest to Risks, I'll forward it here.
<P>
Another interesting thing about this episode is that although the
second mailing said "Jerusalem, CA" and there was no mention of Israel
on it, and although AT&amp;T probably only paid the domestic US postal
rate for it, it still got to us.  Unfortunately, I can't figure out
how long it was delayed, because there's no date on the letter and
there was no cancellation on the envelope (since it was a mass
mailing).

I would like to recommend a new publication called The Jarvis Report.  It
is a quarterly newsletter about industrial espionage, and some technical
tricks of the trade.  Ray Jarvis, who puts out the newsletter, has an
extensive government background in technical surveillance and he provides
classes for government and private security in countermeasures and
associated subjects.  His stated aim is to collect and analyze verifiable
instances of the theft of proprietary information, and to provide an overall
look at trends and problems.
<P>
All 6 sections of the July issue were either useful or entertaining.
This edition includes an account of widespread electronic eavesdropping in
Israel, and suggestions on balanced line detection of series telephone line
transmitters.

<P>
``The DM 14.000.000 equipment suggested a speed limit of 120 km/h - during
a traffic jam.''
<P>
There is a more fundamental problem than software bugs.  As was hinted in
the original article, posting a speed limit, whether electronic or not, is
not necessarily an effective means of controlling traffic.  American drivers
do not pay much attention to speed limits on major roads (the article was
about a German system so the following comments may not apply to it).  When
I say ``do not pay much attention'', I mean actual speed is only weakly
correlated with posted speed.  It is not a simple relation like 10 MPH over
posted speed limit, although that estimate is close to the average.  This
behavior was documented in a government study within the past few years.
<P>
While I was driving on the New Jersey Turnpike a couple years ago an
electronic speed limit/traffic advisory sign told me the speed limit was
temporarily reduced to 45 MPH from the normal 55 MPH due to traffic ahead.
I and everybody else on the road ignored the sign.  We could see well enough
to judge for ourselves whether and how much we needed to slow down.
<P>
The article about the German system cited a wet road warning.  ``Wet road''
is not a useful message.  I can see that for myself.  If the sign could warn
that a sudden storm is coming (or a dust storm, or heavy fog, or invisible
icing) that could prevent accidents.  Every year or two I read a news story
about a massive weather-related accident that might have been averted if
drivers had been warned and had slowed down.  But the cost to build and run
a system which could give adequate warning would probably exceed the savings
from reduced accidents (taking a typical estimate that a life is worth on
the order of a million dollars).
<P>
What do I want from an electronic traffic system?  Don't tell me anything
unless (1) I won't find out for myself until too late and (2) I can do
something in response to the warning.  Otherwise the system is just wasting
my time and distracting me from driving.
<P>
My favorite adaptive road status indication is the hand drawn map I saw
getting on the New York State Thruway in Albany.  It showed where along
the road it was snowing and raining.  It was at a tollbooth so it didn't
take any of my time or distract me from driving and it told me everything
I needed to know (the road was open but conditions were bad) in time for
me to react (the worst weather was a hundred miles away).

<P>
No kidding. I have two post office boxes in different cities, each of which
has its own nine-digit zip code. And I've worked in offices in large
buildings where the office within the building has its own nine-digit zip.
These codes are hardly secret -- they're published in large books that you
can find at your post office.
<P>
The census bureau has been dealing with this particular issue for years.
Quite a while ago I did some work starting with 1970 data organized by the
first three digits of the zip code, and there were one or two entries
blanked out because even the three digit zip area in those cases made it too
easy to identify individuals.
<P>
Incidentally, ZIP codes are now 11 digits, although the last two
digits only appear on bar codes printed on mail by the largest of bulk
mailers. I think this gives every address in the U.S. its own zip.

OPERATIONAL SAFETY NOTICE<BR>
<P>
Dear FLUKE DMM Customer:
<P>
We have become aware of a product malfunction in certain Fluke digital
multimeters (DMM).  This problem is the result of a manufacturing change
implemented in July, 1994.  Only seven models are affected: the Fluke Series
II Model 21, 23, KIT 23, 70, 73,75, and 77 meters imprinted on the case
bottom with serial numbers between 60990000 and 63752000.  No other Fluke
instruments are affected.  If the S/N of your DMM is preceded by a "9" or
followed by an "R", this notice does not apply.
<P>
The malfunction may occur when a voltage input greater than 400 Vdc is
applied in either voltage functions, AC or DC.  The meter may go into a
lock-up state and will indicate a reading of (or near) zero volts.  WHEN THE
MALFUNCTION OCCURS, THE METER MAY NOT INDICATE THAT HIGH VOLTAGE IS PRESENT,
PLACING THE USER IN A POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS SITUATION.  The failure mode
commonly occurs when the positive lead (red) is connected first to a high
voltage supply and then the common (black) lead is connected.
<P>
To correct this problem Fluke will modify your meter without charge.  Even
if you normally do not use your meter in the voltage range mentioned, it is
recommended that you return your meter for modification.
<P>
If you are not the primary user of the affected Fluke DMM, please make every
effort to pass this notice to the appropriate people within your

This discussion illustrates another common RISK: computerphiles losing

<P>
It is easy to get credit card numbers through dumpster diving, shoulder

methods are much easier and simpler than cracking Netscape encryption
with currently available technology.
<P>
Measured against this standard, Netscape encryption is clearly adequate
for credit card numbers until the cracking technology improves a lot. It

Shank has made another logical error: he assumes the machines used to crack

<P>
The "$10,000" estimate is almost certainly too high, by one to three orders
of magnitude.  Several estimates I've seen (posted on the cypherpunks list)
suggest that RC4-40 can be broken, today, in bulk, using commodity hardware,
for between $500 and $1500 per broken key.
<P>
If you were to use custom or semi-custom hardware (FPGAs of various sorts),
the cost reportedly drops to around $10.00 to $20.00 per broken key.
<P>
Here's my estimate for using commodity hardware to attack RC4-40:
<P>
A "P100" 100MHz pentium can try on the order of 20000
RC4 keys per second.  (I think this may be conservative).
<P>
P100 motherboards currently sell for about $600.00, including
the processor.
<P>
If you add power supply, minimal memory, and a network card,
your system cost goes up to around $1000.00 per CPU.
<P>
We'll assume the system has a useful life of 3 years.
<P>
In those three years, it can try 1.89 trillion keys.
2**40 is roughly 1 trillion.
<P>
Therefore, the cost per break clearly under $1000.00
<P>
To look at it another way:
<P>
If I buy 200 P100's, for a total cost of roughly $200,000, I can break
an RC4-40 key every 77 hours.
<P>
If I can make $2000 per broken key, I can make my $200,000 back in
just under a year.

Which indicates that the "Netscape risk" may not be much or any higher than
using your credit card in many other situations.  You may have higher risk
of the card being abused after it arrives, especially since the recipient
can claim that the fraud was the results of evil hackers and not one of
their untrustworthy employees.
<P>
I applaud the highlighting of this risk to help people make informed choices
about it.  It sounds like more of this information should be available to

<P>
&gt; Ross Anderson posted a message on the net recently stating that Australia<BR>
&gt; was proposing an encryption policy that would force residents to use weak<BR>
&gt; cryptography while banks would get key escrow.<BR>
<P>
Dorothy Denning goes on to say that I misinterpreted Mr Orlowski; that he
`is not proposing that individuals be forced to use weak encryption'.
Well, Orlowski is now wriggling like a lawyer, but I was there at the
conference, and on the panel with him afterwards. His paper states that
<P>
`the needs of the majority of users of the infrastructure for privacy
and smaller financial transactions can be met by lower level
encryption'<BR>
and<BR>
`Given that a large proportion of the population would not be using
the higher level encryption products, application of key escrow for
such products is less likely to create the type of adverse reaction
seen to date. Government agencies and large financial institutions are
more likely to accept the need for key escrow in the type of products
which they use'<BR>
and<BR>
`As mentioned earlier, I see encryption being utilised on two levels, a
general level being used by the majority of users and a more
sophisticated level with much more limited use. Intercepted messages
under the first level may be able to be decrypted by the various
interception authorities.
<P>
`The second level would probably, however, require more sophisticated
techniques in circumstances where the key cannot, for whatever reason,
be recovered from escrow. This may be achieved by the establishment of
a central decrypting unit which would receive, decrypt and transmit back
messages'
<P>
He stated at this point, in a verbal aside, that the AG's department
considered itself the proper repository for this `central decrypting unit'.
As I summarised it in my original post to risks:
<P>
&gt; 40 bit keys for the masses, 56-bit escrowed keys for the banks, and a<BR>
&gt; Wiener machine sitting in Orlowski's office. Belt, braces and string.
<P>
Orlowski does phrase his comments as advocacy rather than prescription, and
he does have a disclaimer saying that these are his personal views, not
those of the Australian government.
<P>
But it emerged in the subsequent discussions that the paper did not really
represent his personal views at all. Not only was he unable to defend them
with any vigour during the panel, but he admitted that he had been told to
float the policy by his boss, who didn't want to appear himself out of fear
of the sort of fuss which greeted the Clipper chip in the USA, and the last
attempt to introduce ID cards in Australia. With a general election due, the
Keating government is vulnerable, and this clearly limits their spooks'
freedom of action.
<P>
Risks readers might like to know that the usual suspects - John Rogers from
the Australian Defence Signals Directorate and Mark King from GCHQ - were
prominent in the audience. King arrived on the same plane as me; he flew
business class and went off to a posh downtown hotel. I doubt that GCHQ paid
for all that out of idle curiosity.
<P>
Orlowski's article also states
<P>
"Debate on these issues should be limited to the appropriate
parties rather than widely promulgated on the network."
<P>
Curiously, I was not able to post to usenet while I was in Australia --
nobody at Queensland University of Technology was, and their sysprogs
couldn't find the fault. (Is this a RISK of playing host to someone involved
in the crypto policy debate?) Anyway, once I got back to the UK, I brought
Orlowski's proposals to public attention - and this has led to precisely the
fuss which Canberra was clearly trying to avoid.
<P>
Finally, Orlowski did not even get the URL of his paper right in the letter
which Dorothy posted to this group. It is actually to be found at

I'm not sure I've got all the details right, but...
<P>
National Public Radio's "All Things Considered" reported on Friday August 25
that the "Aspen Daily News" (Aspen CO) had published an article reporting
that a large number of men aged 13-78 had been hospitalized from "sexual
exhaustion" after some woman took advantage of them.  The story, which was
supposed to be a joke, made it into the newspaper (or so it sounds) because
a writer, who had made up the fake story for internal distribution,
accidentally put the article in the directory where stories to be in the
next edition belong.  The automatic page-layout software picked it up from
there.  It sounds like the galleys were never examined by a human (or if so,
they did a sloppy job).  Reaction by the newspaper readers has been
mixed...some have been amused, while others thought it was "pornography".
<P>
According to the editor-in-chief of the newspaper, who was interviewed on
the program, there were four safeguards (not specifically named) that all
failed to allow the piece into the paper.  As a result of the incident,
they've added a fifth safeguard: only editors can place articles in the
to-be-printed directory.  It's not clear whether that's a procedural or
computer-enforced restriction.
<P>
The risk is that as newspaper production becomes more and more automated,
there's less need for people to do reviews, and hence a greater risk of an
error like this happening.
<P>
In the meantime, the author of the particular piece is still working at the
newspaper.  The editor-in-chief did not disclose what punishment, if any,
there would be.

SOCIAL INSECURITY PLAN TO MAKE IT EASIER TO
TRACK DOWN 'DEADBEAT DADS' WORRIES PRIVACY ADVOCATES<BR>
Simson Garfinkel, Special to the Mercury News<BR>
San Jose Mercury News, 17 July 1995, Business Monday, Page 1F<BR>
Copyright 1995, Simson Garfinkel<BR>
<P>
ELEVEN years late, the 1984 as envisioned by George Orwell finally may
arrive.
Welfare reform legislation moving through Congress could dramatically
increase the use of Social Security numbers by state governments as a way
to track people from cradle to grave. The proposal, which would create or
expand a series of national data banks, is designed to track people who
don't want to be found.<BR>
With support among both Democrats and Republicans, the proposal is
striking fear among the guardians of  privacy, who believe the legislation
would increase the government's surveillance of the American public.
''What we are facing is the single greatest step toward big brother
government since Watergate,'' said Donald L. Haines, a legislative counsel
with the American Civil Liberties Union in Washington.<BR>
Nevertheless, the proposal has received relatively little attention
because the expanded use of Social Security numbers is one of the few areas
of agreement between the Republican-controlled Congress and the Clinton
administration.<BR>
Welfare reform was one of President Clinton's campaign promises, and it
also was one of the 10 tenets of the Republican Party's ''Contract with
America.''<BR>
Called the ''Personal Responsibility Act,'' the U.S. House of
Representatives passed its version of the bill March 24. The Senate
version, retitled the ''Family Self-Sufficiency Act of 1995,'' passed a
committee vote June 9. Although the committee, chaired by Sen. Bob
Packwood, R-Ore., made substantial changes to  the House bill, the sections
dealing with the expanded use of Social Security numbers remained
essentially intact. At the heart of the legislation is the desire to do
something about so-called ''deadbeat dads'' - and moms -   who refuse to
pay court-ordered child support payments. Both Congress and the Clinton
administration believe that a large amount of the money spent on the
government's Aid to Families with Dependent Children program could be saved
if more single parents obtained child support orders, and if those orders
were better enforced.<BR>
''People normally say that there is a $34 billion gap'' between the $14
billion that is annually paid in child support and the $48 billion that
theoretically could be collected, says Jane Checkan of the Health and Human
Service's Administration on Children and Families in Washington. Checkan's
figures are for the year 1993, the last year available.
In an attempt to close this gap, the welfare reform legislation
mandates increased surveillance of all American citizens. By tracking
Americans when they change jobs or receive state driver's or professional
licenses, the legislation's backers hope to give deadbeat dads nowhere to
hide.<BR>
The legislation also calls for mandatory reporting of Social Security
numbers by people getting marriage licenses or divorced, and in paternity
proceedings. These reports are designed to make it easier for single
parents to obtain support orders, and to make it easier for state welfare
agencies to figure out the identity of a spouse when a single parent
applies for benefits.<BR>
''Ten million women are potentially eligible to child support for their
kids,'' Checkan said. But many people do not take advantage of their legal
rights. ''Forty-two percent do not have an award in place.'' Welfare reform
pushed<BR>
Checkan said that it is estimated that as much as 8 percent of the
government's Aid to Families with Dependent Children payments could be
eliminated if child support orders were obtained and enforced. ''That's
why, in the Clinton proposal, that child support is such a major part of
welfare reform,'' she said.<BR>
Currently, many government agencies maintain databases that are indexed
by Social Security numbers. Nevertheless, the databases are of limited use
for welfare enforcement. Some of the databases are restricted by statute so
that their information may not be used for purposes other than that which
they were collected. A move to unify standards<BR>
Others are not cross-indexed with databases of current address,
employment and child support orders.  Still other databases cannot easily
be searched against, because the information is not in a uniform format.
One of the intents of the legislation, sponsors say, is to bring order to
this computational chaos by mandating standard data representation and
indexing strategies. Basing the databanks on Social Security numbers is key
to its success, said Bill Walsh, chief of California's Child Support
Management Bureau, part of the Department of Social Services.<BR>
''I'll tell you, the Social Security number is probably the most
important piece of data that there is in trying to locate parents that we
can't find in order to establish child-support orders, or in cases where we
have already established an order, to get payment on those orders,'' he
said.<BR>
A national database also could make it easier to track down the 30
percent of dads who live outside the state, said Walsh. Although such a
database currently exists, the proposed legislation would greatly expand
its reach, by creating a virtual dragnet that could not be escaped. Civil
libertarians worry<BR>
Walsh said  his department is in favor of creation and expansion of
the national databanks, because they ''allow us to have access to more and
better data in order to locate parents who owe child support.''
Nevertheless, a growing number of civil libertarians are questioning
the creation of large-scale national databanks, and the expanded use of
Social Security numbers, for tracking down deadbeat dads.<BR>
''It's a databank that could be used to allow people to track people
down for purposes having nothing to do with (child support),'' said Haines
of the ACLU.<BR>
Haines is especially worried that the system could be used to find
victims of domestic violence who are attempting to hide from their
assailants.<BR>
''An unfortunate truth is that in our justice system today, for many
victims of domestic violence, their only hope for relief is to escape into
some level of anonymity,'' he said. ''Protective orders don't work or
aren't enforced.''<BR>
Although the legislation would prohibit the unauthorized use of the
system, Haines characterized such use as ''inevitable.'' As an example, he
noted how some abusive men find runaway spouses using surreptitious means,
such as privileged data reserved for law enforcement. Potential for fraud
Other privacy advocates are concerned that the databanks could be
used as the basis for financial fraud.<BR>
''I think that there is a real danger using (information) provided for
one purpose for another purpose,'' said Claudia Terraza, an attorney with
the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse at the University of San Diego. ''I see a
real problem with people getting access to your Social Security number and
from there, being able to find out your credit report, or for finding out
other information that they could use for fraudulent purposes.''<BR>
Privacy advocates are most upset about the expansion of the Federal
Parent Locator Service. As written, the legislation would create a national
database of virtually all U.S. citizens - parents or not - with the stated
purpose of tracking them so that any individual's most recent address and
employer can be easily determined at any time. The legislation also would
help enforce court- ordered parental visitation rights.<BR>
Staff members working on both the House and Senate versions of the
legislation said that lawmakers were aware of the privacy issues, and had
tried to put ''privacy protection'' measures into the legislation without
compromising the central goal of creating a national location registry.
''We had a long discussion about (privacy issues) - and the (lawmakers)
were the main people doing the talking,'' said a staffer. ''There were some
members who were real sensitive, and they were absolutely adamant that (the
Social Security number)  could not be required to be on the license
itself.''<BR>
Nevertheless, the legislation does require states to ask drivers for
their Social Security numbers when they are issued driver's licenses or
professional licenses, and for those numbers to be reported to the central
registry.<BR>
''What all of that means is that we will have a de facto national ID
system in this country, which is going to be this database, and with a de
facto national ID card,  which will be your Social Security card/driver's
license, all without a debate on whether or not Americans deserve to be
subjected to a Soviet- or Nazi-style national ID system,'' Haines said.
<P><BR>
Effort failed in '60s<BR>
This is not the first time that the federal government has proposed
creating a national databank. A proposal in the late 1960s called for the
creation of a national data center that would ''pull together the scattered
statistics in government files on citizens and to provide instant, total
recall of significant education, health, citizenship, employment records
and in some cases personal habits of individuals,'' reported an article in
the Feb. 25, 1968 issue of The New York Times.<BR>
At the time, the proposal was  opposed  by privacy advocates like
Columbia University Professor Alan F. Westin and University of Michigan Law
School Professor Arthur R. Miller.    Information centers ''may become the
heart of the surveillance system that will turn society into a transparent
world in which our home, our finances, our associates, our mental and
physical conditions are bared to the most casual observer,'' Miller told
the Times.<BR>
The national data center was never built, and today the controversy has
been largely forgotten. Nevertheless, says Marc Rotenberg, director of the
Electronic Privacy Information Center, one of the important issues raised
at the time was the danger of entrusting a single federal agency with so
many different files.<BR>
''These proposals invariably reach further than originally intended,''
said Rotenberg. ''If the Social Security number is used today to catch
welfare cheats, it can be used tomorrow to identify political dissidents.
''It is of course ironic that such a proposal would go through the
Congress at the very same time that the Republican majority is urging
greater relaxation of government regulation.''

INFOBOX: THEY'VE GOT YOUR NUMBER
<P>
Legislation currently before the Senate would mandate the creation or
expansion of three national databanks. Each databank would be indexed
by Social Security number. Together, they would track every American.
<P>
(box) Federal Parent Locator Service: Would contain a record of every
driver's license and professional license issued in individual states.
<P>
(box) Federal Case Registry of Child Support Orders: Besides tracking
every child support order issued by the states, this database also
would contain records of every marriage, every divorce and every
paternity determination case in the United States.
<P>
(box) State Directory of New Hires: This federal database would be
updated every time an American started working for a new employer. It
would contain the employee's name, address, job description, and the
name of their employer.

The (relatively) new Parkway North in Pittsburgh (I279) has the only High
Occupancy Vehicle lane in the state.  It is a reversible two lane road that
runs down the middle of the Interstate for about 5 miles.  It is open into the
city for the morning rush, and out from the city for the evening rush.
<P>
On Friday, early afternoon, while the lanes were still opened Southbound, an
apparently lost carload of people entered heading North.  The resulting
head-on collision between the car and a pickup truck killed several people.
<P>
I would have thought that making such a lane reasonably failsafe not be too
difficult.  Manual barriers at each end.  Close the whole thing at
changeover.  Verify visually by driving a highway truck down it that the
lanes are empty.  Then manually open up the barriers for the correct
direction.  Interlocks as appropriate.
<P>
It turns out that because of real estate (the lack thereof) several of the
ramps on the downtown side are dual use.  During the morning rush they are
exit ramps.  During the afternoon rush they are entry ramps.  There wasn't
enough physical space to put in separate entry and exit ramps.  Hence, no
barriers. Instead, they rely on flashing lights and Do Not Enter and Wrong
Way signs which get pointed aside or turned off when they are not needed.
Short of putting in tire shredders for wrong way travel, I cannot think of a
way to make this kind of arrangement safe against your typical non-observant
driver.

Pinellas is Florida's most densely populated county. Approximately 42,000
students are transported daily by 510 buses. This school year, which started
August 21, has been an example of what happens when poor planning is
exacerbated by ineffectively used automated routing and scheduling software.
<P>
The *St. Petersburg Times* reported on August 24 that buses are showing up
late - sometimes by two or more hours. Some come early and don't wait for
students. Some bus rides are lasting more than an hour, which is against
state law. Some buses are overcrowded, with children sitting on the floor.
Wednesday, one bus came three hours late, and another required 45 minutes
for a 14-block trip. Parents and school board officials are having
difficulty contacting transportation department officials, who are blaming
the problems on a computer program the district installed within the past
year.
<P>
The Edulog system is set up with maps of the county and house addresses;
data entered by the district includes names, addresses and schools, as well
as speed limits on various streets. The computer is supposed to provide the
most efficient routes, which resulted in many stops being moved or deleted.
<P>
Apparently, officials didn't use "speed made good" common sense and assumed
that the speed limits were the actual average speed without regard for
traffic or stops. Some parents did not register their children for school on
time. Planning will start earlier next year, according to the transportation
head, and new transportation coordinators will be hired. Similar (but less
severe) problems were experienced last year.
<P>
Maybe they should let the students (and parents) use the program; they
probably understand the risks a lot better.

In anticipating traveling internationally, I decided to get CO-based phone
mail since I thought it would be more reliable to connect to than my analog
answering machine.  Because I've got two lines, I decided that I'd put the
service on the second line and then forward the first to the second when I
need to. I tried testing the forwarding and found that when I called the
first number, instead of just giving me voice mail, it asked me to key in a
number, presumably the number I was calling -- the first number. So I
obliged, and got a message from someone saying he was in Central America and
couldn't answer the calls.
<UL>
<LI>The request to key in the number is clearly a bug since the caller doesn't
know that I've forwarded the call nor the number to which I forwarded the
call.
<P>
<LI>Since my ownership of both number predates the installation of the switch,
it seemed that the caller gets directed into hyperspace.
<P>
<LI>When asking for the service, I was told that they were planning to drop the
stutter dialtone since it didn't work reliably!
<P>
<LI>I did not test the interactions with distinctive ringing numbers. I feared
the worst but didn't have the time.
</UL>
In speaking to the service people about this, the basic response is that
this is a problem with the DMS-100 (Northern Telecom) switch and not
necessarily the ATT ESS switches. This is the same DMS that, on my ISDN
line, requires two numbers for a 2B call whereas the ESS needs only one.
<P>
I don't know what profound lessons there are to learn except that I'm amazed
out the presence of such a gross bug in an expensive production CO. It would
never be tolerated in a $29.99 software package. This is a feature
interaction but unlike the problems with ad-hoc interaction between
separately produced features, this should be testable. Note, though, that
voice mail is often provided by a third party, such as Octel, and the bug
could be due to version interactions between to disparate systems.

Isn't the main purpose of the intelligent highway traffic system from
the perspective of the system as a whole: throttling and rerouting the
incoming traffic to a section/region of road to preserve the linear
queuing behavior and get good throughput.  On urban grids, the stop
lights serve this function: attempting to prevent gridlock and
deadlock. On high speed roadways there are no stoplights, and the
range of speeds available is greater, so the periodic signs have
greater control latitude.
<P>
So the signs aren't saying "slow down because the cars ahead of you
are going slower" but rather something like "slow down because this
can prevent congestion and stop and go traffic ahead that will make
the throughput of the entire system plummet".

German Hacker in White House Computer Annoys the Internet<BR>
By Justus Demmer, German Press Agency
<P>
Hamburg (German Press Agency) - Among those familiar with the Information
Superhighway, there are certain rules of behavior: Netiquette.  In the last
week, German hackers have broken with Netiquette, offending some users of
the global network of some 30 million computer users by sending a message
accusing users of attempting to penetrate the US White House's computers.
The alleged sender of these messages?  President Bill Clinton.
<P>
An article in the German Computer Magazine "c't," published in Hanover,
broke the news. However the messages leave telltales of their German origin,
which tipped off the Systems Administrator in the White House who in turn
notified the German Computer Emergency Response Team, DFN-CERT.
<P>
DFN-CERT functions as a kind of fire department for the Internet.  They
identified the "Clinton-Mails" as fakemail according to the magazine's
article.  DFN-CERT acted but withheld news of the attacks.
<P>
[DMK:  So apparently did the White House.  Possibly one of the many Sendmail
holes?]
<P>
DFN-CERT staff member Uwe Ellerman said Internet users, and especially
magazines, have a responsibility to acknowledge attacks.  However many do
not want to admit they were penetrated.  Ellerman said that the press
should report these matters.  The magazine should make their own computers
available for such silly tricks if they wish.
<P>
However, explained c't editor Georg Schnurer, that has not been the case.
He claimed the White House uses an old version of software for electronic
mail handling which is obsolete. This program makes it possible to falsify
mail.  Many other System Administrators also use this older version,
leaving the network vulnerable to similar attacks.
<P>
[DMK: More pointers towards Sendmail.  More pointers to why it should be
acknowledged so that the clueless will check for Sendmail holes.  Possibly
confirming fact, the recent US CERT Sendmail Alert.]
<P>
Ellerman and Schnurer do not agree whether public notice of the White
House error was necessary or not, they do agree that to maintain integrity
over their mail, users should encrypt their mail.

REVIEW: Computer Crime: A Crimefighter's Handbook, by David Icove, Karl
Seger, and William VonStorch. Published by OReilly &amp; Associates, Inc.,
August 1995. 437 pages, with index. ISBN: 1-56592-086-4.
<P>
COMPUTER CRIME: A CRIMEFIGHTER'S HANDBOOK was derived from an FBI training
manual on the prevention and investigation of computer crimes.  It delivers
a wide-ranging, non-technical overview of computer system vulnerabilities,
threat assessment, and the law.
<P>
Covering the gamut from unlawful intrusion to poisoning of computer
operations staff, this book provides an excellent introduction to threat
assessment and security procedures for protecting an organization from
computer crime. Unlike most computer security books aimed at system
administrators, this one is written from the perspective of law
enforcement, and describes what to do before, during, and after a
computer crime is discovered.
<P>
The book is divided into five parts. The first part of the book
describes vulnerabilities, threats, and countermeasures, with equal
emphasis given to the human components of a system as well as technical
issues. The section on Social Engineering is well illustrated, if a bit
too short, and some of the more obscure possibilities for covert
channels and compromising emanations are well covered. The discussion
suffers from a lack of references to documented attacks (see below), and
a somewhat confusing explanation of the differences between Trojan
Horses, viruses, worms, and logic bombs. Chapter 5, on risk assessment,
nonetheless is excellent.
<P>
Physical, personnel, and communications security are covered in the
remainder of Part II. One exposure that I thought was not mentioned
highly enough is the vulnerability of backup media to theft. Dumpster
diving is discussed in some detail (together with a humorous and
totally unnecessary diagram).
<P>
I would have liked to see references given for many of the examples of
computer crimes scattered throughout the book. Some of the descriptions
edge toward hyperbole; more complete references would allow the reader
to pursue further information if needed. Two of the appendices, written
by John Gales Sauls and Michael G. Noblett, are liberally referenced.
<P>
Part III of the book is the most unusual. It is essentially a checklist
for the professional investigator who needs to collect and preserve
evidence of a computer crime. Much detail is presented on the
identification and preservation of anything even remotely related to a
criminal investigation (within the bounds of the required search
warrant, of course). Appendix D contains the full text of an actual
search warrant used in an investigation in 1994, which makes for
fascinating reading.
<P>
It is interesting to compare these chapters with the Foreword, in which
Chris Goggans describes a search of his home by the U.S. Secret Service
in 1990.
<P>
Part IV contains the text of laws covering computer and communications
security in the United States at the level of Federal and State courts.
The text of a proposed computer crime law from Ghana is also included,
for completeness.
<P>
Appendices list books, organizations, electronic resources and
governmental agencies responsible for computer security. These
appendices are not nearly as detailed as those provided in COMPUTER
SECURITY BASICS, by Deborah Russell and G.T. Gangemi, Sr. (ISBN: 0-
937175-71-4), another book published by OReilly &amp; Associates. Together,
the two books complement one another perfectly.

A new convenience included in Microsoft Network e-mail processing could
present a loophole for invading computer viruses, warn some security
experts.  When an MSN user sends a binary file as part of an e-mail message,
it appears as an icon on the recipient's screen.  When the recipient
double-clicks on it, it's automatically downloaded and executed.  To
download without executing the file, the recipient must click with the
little-used button on the right of the mouse.  "On the Microsoft Network, I
can disguise an icon so that it looks innocuous," says the VP and chief
technical officer for Interactive Data Corp.  "The analogy I like to use is
the Unabomber.  If you get a package in the mail that's wrapped in duct tape
and brown paper, you'd regard it as suspicious.  But if it's a plain white
envelope with Ed McMahon's picture on it, you wouldn't think twice about
opening it."  Microsoft responds that "There are risks of getting data off
the network in any form.  People have to be aware of what the source of
information is."  (Information Week, 28 Aug 1995, p24)

Subject: Information on Winword virus (PC/Mac)<BR>
<P>
As many of you will know, there's a Microsoft Word macro virus out there
(variously known as "Winword.Concept", "WW6Macro" and "Prank Macro") that
has apparently made it into the wild. The idea of macro-language viruses is
not new -- indeed, AFAIR, Prof H. J. Highland, editor of Computers &amp;
Security, demonstrated the possiblity under Lotus 1-2-3 several years ago.
What is new is that this Word macro virus seems to be in the wild, and that
it seems to be driving people wild. Certainly, news wires are abuzz.  If we
believe what we're told, it's the End Of Computing As We Know It (again :-).
<P>
The concept is obvious, and has been much discussed. Most products can read
and write data files; some allow their data files to contain programmatic
commands that would more typically be typed at the keyboard or issued with a
mouse. The idea is that when you load a data file with a "command script" or
"macro" in it, you can carry out a whole sequence of program functions
automatically -- rather than having to type them in over and over again.
<P>
Many programs with macro support allow their macros to access a substantial
range of functions, such as opening, manipulating and closing files -- or
even issuing direct operating system commands. Some macro systems go even
further -- they allow macros to be mixed with regular data files, and they
define special types of macro (typically identified by a predefined name, or
position) which will automatically be fired up when a file is loaded or the
system is started. DOS has such a system -- no prizes for guessing where the
name AUTOEXEC.BAT comes from.
<P>
No prizes, either, for working out that data-file + macro-language +
autoexec-of-special-macros is a formula which works out to a security
nightmare. Viruses, Trojan Horses, modification-of-service attacks -- all
are remarkably possible in such an environment.
<P>
MS Word 6.0 has a particularly rich macro language (WordBasic), and a number
of "macro hooks" whereby an unsuspecting user can be lured into executing a
hitherto unseen and unknown macro simply by loading a document. This is how
Winword.Concept works -- we leave the actual details as an exercise to the
reader, for safety's sake.
<P>
Winword.Concept is obvious, and easy to handle. Most anti-virus software
users should be able to contact their vendor for help on how to detect and
clean it up (Sophos SWEEP clients certainly can: mail to
<A HREF="mailto:technical@sophos.com">technical@sophos.com</A> if you're worried). There is a bigger issue, though,
which you would do well to address *now*.  Ask yourself if you are aware of
any "automatic macro" facilities in the software your organisation uses. And
ask yourself if you know how to control the operation and scope of these
facilities.
<P>
For example, if you're a WinWord user, did you know that:
<UL>
<LI>a document can contain an AutoOpen macro, which may be
executed transparently and automatically when that document

You can see the risk here. You may know, or be told, though, that:
<P>
<LI>holding down &lt;Shift&gt; whilst opening a document will inhibit
the invocation of its AutoOpen macro.
<P>
<LI>Tools/Options/Save includes an option ("Prompt to save

macros much less likely.
<P>
<LI>that you can instruct WinWord, when you load it, to switch off
"automatic" macros altogether, by loading it with the command
"WINWORD.EXE /mDisableAutoMacros", or by holding down the &lt;Shift&gt;
key as you fire it up.
</UL>
You may also, like me, try out these fixes and discover that the first and
last don't actually seem to work as suggested! There is a good trick for
WinWord, however: create yourself a global AutoExec macro (this is run when
Word starts up) that looks like this:
<P><CODE>
Sub MAIN<BR>
DisableAutoMacros<BR>
MsgBox "Auto Macros are turned off", "Safety First!", 64<BR>
End Sub</CODE>
<P>
WinWord.Concept -- and other malware based on AutoOpen -- will not work if
you do this.
<P>
Control is in your hands. Don't panic. Take the opportunity to learn more
about features of the software you use, to test and verify any security
features you plan to utilise, and then to configure accordingly. Don't treat
this new Word virus as a nightmare; use it as an opportunity to take stock,
and to learn.

Two telling excerpts from a Sunday, 27 August 1995 _Denver Post_ article
(page 3B).
<P>
2000 May Hold Years of Trouble<BR>
4-digit dates bedevil computers
<P>
By Patrick O'Driscoll<BR>
Denver Post Staff Writer
<P>
[Clayton Powers, staff director for Colorado Commission on Information
Management] said "If you wrote really good code, you might put your date
routine in one place.  Another programmer may have a date routine 10
times in a program."
<P>
Ironically, institutional computer geeks have known about "the year
2000 changeover" for years, to the point it even became an inside joke.
<P>
The first paragraph explains why it's the big organizations we need to fear
on the upcoming odometer rollover.  Small companies tend to be much more
insistent on at least minimal competence and efficiency.  I have a hard time
conceiving of any programmer needing to write a date routine more than once
-- that's the type of code that goes into a library.
<P>
Additionally, small companies tend to sell to many users, and some of us are
warped enough to occasionally set the clock forward to 2012 or so, just to
see what happens.  :-)
<P>
On the other hand, there's only one user of many government computer
systems, and those systems are in continuous use.  If they don't test their
own software, nobody will.
<P>
On a related note, 7 years ago I came across an Ada relational database
which could handle most dates past the turn of the century, but had serious
problems with dates from March 2000 through February 2001.  How many people
check for problems in that bit of logic?  Don't assume that 01 Jan 2000 is
the only problematic date.  I would also check around 29 Feb 2000, 01 Mar
2000 and 28 Feb 2001.
<P>
(The last two dates can be a problem due to day-of-week calculation
which uses a year running from March through February.)
<P>
The second paragraph is a rather interesting bit of institutional bigotry.
The Denver Post also runs radio ads for their weekend classified section,
referring to having plenty of jobs for "computer geeks."
<P>
I'll freely admit to calling myself a "geek," but the meaning of that term
as I use it is very different than the meaning implied by some hostile
copywriter.  And it _is_ "hostile" when that's the only term used and it's
stretched to cover everything from a 13-year-old surfing the net to people
with 20 years experience and advanced degrees.
<P>
This article carries on that tone, with three paragraphs spent on this
"inside joke," but absolutely no space spent on the substantial effort that
has already gone into this effort, the lessons learned after the DOS "sign
change" in 1989, or the fact that many software professionals have been
fighting management for years over the need to start patching code _now_.
<P>
BTW, the "inside joke" offered wasn't the "Ship of Fools."  (Everyone goes
on an extended cruise; the "fools" is a reference to the crucial role of the
fool or court jester in medieval Europe, roughly what we would have as a
"Devil's Advocate" today.)  Instead it was a much more self-centered fantasy
about programmers retiring before 2000 (to avoid the frantic phone calls
from users?), and only when they realize it will affect their pension checks
do they decide to take action -- fixing the pension system software.
<P>
Overall, the tone of the article seems a lot like Christians taunting the
lions.  The author admits there's a problem, a big problem, and that it has
the potential to harm him (with references to "income taxes, welfare,
employment records and the like.")
<P>
But rather than working towards a solution, he gratuitously insults the only
people who could help him.
<P>
Am I reading too much into this?  Perhaps.  But at the same time I've been
aware of this problem for years, and have played no small part in helping to
mitigate the problem.  (I've found and reported several significant library
bugs for dates after 31 Dec 1999.)  I find it hard to understand how this
reporter could spend several paragraphs on a joke, but not make a single
mention of the fact that many people have already been working on this
problem.
<P>
Hmmpf, he didn't even mention the '89 meltdown, which would seem to be a
good starting point since so many people had problems with it.  It's a good
model of the problems we face in '00.
<P>
(For the curious, my project used DOS-style dates.  A coworker and I both
used "unsigned [short] int" for all dates and our packages had no problems.
(The other guy also wrote the date package, fortunately.)  It never occurred
to either of us that our coworkers might not have understood why the
"unsigned" was important, and one day their code suddenly started to fail.
Our product was very schizophrenic for a couple days, but we were able to
get fixed releases out quickly.)

<P>
&gt;a writer, who had made up the fake story for internal distribution,
<P>
The coverage in the local press suggests (to the sufficiently warped
mind) that this was a prank article for a female friend's birthday.
I guess the idea is that _she_ was the female in question, and the
fact that the reporter scheduled the following day off only seems to
strengthen this conjecture. ;-)
<P>
&gt;accidentally put the article in the directory where stories to be in the<BR>
&gt;next edition belong.
<P>
That's not hard to imagine; that's probably a short sequence which is
heavily used.  He probably gave it as much thought as a "vi" user
gives to ":wq".
<P>
&gt;Reaction by the newspaper readers has been<BR>
&gt;mixed...some have been amused, while others thought it was "pornography".
<P>
That paper has a reputation for being laid back; the local coverage
made it clear that everyone involved (except possibly the Chief of
Police) was trying hard not to laugh too hard.
<P>
I would treat claims it was "pornographic" akin to claims "that in a
recent survey of 100 teenage Americans only 20% could identify Canada
on a map."  (Or something similar.)  It's possible, but it's much more
likely the people involved were having fun with a credulous reporter.
(You have to remember that this was _Aspen_.)
<P>
&gt;In the meantime, the author of the particular piece is still working at the<BR>
&gt;newspaper.  The editor-in-chief did not disclose what punishment, if any,<BR>
&gt;there would be.
<P>
He probably left that up to the reporter's girlfriend.  I hope she
has a good sense of humor.  (_We_ don't know the name of the woman...
but I expect her friends recognized clues woven into the story :-)
<P>
&gt;The risk is that as newspaper production becomes more and more automated,<BR>
&gt;there's less need for people to do reviews, and hence a greater risk of an<BR>
&gt;error like this happening.
<P>
No, it's an example of the risks of an overly-serious workplace.
People _will_ play games with the computer system; in this case it's a
reporter writing bogus stories for a friend on the computer.
<P>
This is desirable because it helps the person develop new skills.
There are very few jobs (and none of them are very desirable) where
the skills you have on the first day are all you'll ever need.  And
it's often not realistic to expect the person to have a sufficient
"mock up" available at home or elsewhere.
<P>
But the American workplace is increasingly "serious."  You can get
into very real trouble for "screwing around," even if you can show that
most of your recent major advancements (instead of yet more regurgitation
of the same thing) directly followed such idle explorations.
<P>
And because you don't have a chance to learn how to safely work outside of
the main loop, if you do sneak in a bit of extracurricular fun you're much
more likely to accidentally put the lark into the main data stream.  That
appears to be what happened here.

<P>
At the Los Angeles Times (where I work but which I DO NOT (generally)
represent at a policy level) we have several filters to avert the
publication of bogus news stories.  Basically, most writers do not have
sufficient system authority to put stories directly into the paper
(although, of course, certain editors do...  but they are trusted).  The
organizational method of planning how to fill the space in each edition
provides the basis for a later sanity check on the material which is
actually sent to typesetting (cold) and pasted up.
<P>
However, we no longer employ proofreaders.  Any glitch which isn't caught by
spell-check or a sharp-eyed editor will get into the paper and many typos
and editing mistakes do.  And, as with so many systems, a privileged person
acting maliciously could put something inappropriate in (at least on an
inner page).  Actually, we print more wrong stuff because our writers are
misinformed, or misunderstand their informants, or misrepresent something
out of ignorance than we ever do because of deliberate or inadvertent
sabotage.  (We have printed errors, but never of any great magnitude.  We
have never printed an improper front-page story for any computer- related
reasons.
<P>
One reason we haven't yet replaced our TANDEM-based integrated software
package timesharing-terminal system for news writing and editing is that we
would have to address many system reliability and security requirements in a
new system that most microcomputer-based client/server system vendors don't
handle well or sometimes at all.
<P>
We used to proofread display advertising matter, but we quit doing that a
couple of years ago.  I myself once caught an ad with incorrect dates in it
when I walked through the composing room and glanced at the Travel section
being made up (we had been asked to run an ad which had run before.  The
salesperson didn't realize that the dates--of cruise-ship sailings--were
"out of date" and needed to be "updated").  I spotted the anomaly and
alerted the composing people, who yanked the ad and called the salesperson.
We were able to get the correction in time to run the ad.
<P>
We do proofread classified (liner) ads--more to catch crooks (who attempt to
cheat the public, or sometime us) and deadbeats (who owe us money and try to
run more ads without paying us for the old ones), and to censor "offensive"
stuff (e.g., real-estate ads that suggest some kind of racial exclusivity)
than to find spelling errors.  (Mind you, our classified salespeople don't
key in very many spelling errors.)
<P>
I might point out that we try pretty hard to keep advertisers who cheat the
public out of our pages.  Such advertisers often cheat us too, plus we think
that readers who get cheated will be less likely to buy our paper and
patronize our other advertisers, and that in turn would hurt our business.
I like to think we would censor racist/sexist/whatever advertising no matter
what, but we are given extra incentive to do so by the law (which I believe
is a wicked, wrong law) that makes *the Times* liable to pay damages to
victims of advertisers who violate civil-rights laws, and sometimes other
laws, *even though the Times is not a party to the transaction*.  (And
before any of you get too huffy about the benefits of 3rd-party liability as
a way of enlisting the otherwise indifferent in the war on -isms, realize
that we censor anything vaguely suspicious and be glad you're not trying to
rent out a house near a shopping center--'cause we may not let you advertise
"walking distance to shops" since that might imply you would discriminate
against cripples.)

Unfortunately for this argument, they're also a lot riskier. You have to
physically be in a location where the CC# is present for all but the
social engineering attacks like telephone scams, and unless you're cold
calling people and soliciting them (a low-return operation, and one unlikely
to generate high-limit numbers) you're dealing with people who have a valid
phone number for you.

of RISKS.  The following item came to him as a response from a
German teacher, Thiomir Glowatzky, of Bamberg.  I include the German,
with "u umlaut" being represented as "|", but the essence of it is simply
that the spelling corrector wanted to replace
<P>
Kafka, Musil and Schnitzler

RISKS readers may be interested in the story to be found on the web at
<A HREF="http://www.dnai.com/g-think/$$tablecontents.html">http://www.dnai.com/g-think/$$tablecontents.html</A>
<P>
It tells of a man (Patrick Combs) who, according to himself, deposited into
an ATM a "check" for $95,000.  This "check" was one of the authentic-looking
come-on gimmicks that we so often receive in our junk mail.  In this case,
it was a solicitation for a get-rich-quick scheme and the "check" was
purportedly an "example of the kind of money" one could earn using this
scheme.
<P>
The "check" bore a valid signature and account number as well as a realistic
amount ($95,093.35).  The only indication that it was not a valid document
was the phrase "not negotiable for cash" inconspicuously placed in a corner.
More interestingly, the "check" met all nine of the legal criteria for a
valid bearer document.
<P>
Apparently, the warning message was not seen and the amount was credited to
Mr Combs' account.  The amount remained in his account for several weeks
and, after repeated inquiries to the bank Combs withdrew the money in the
form of a cashier's check, which he then placed in a safe-deposit box.
<P>
Throughout the story, Combs maintains that he had/has no fraudulent intent.
The fact that he has not spent a cent of the money despite ample opportunity
to do so lends credence to his claim.  Eventually, of course, the bank
detected the error and demanded its money back.  Its method of treating Mr
Combs will be familiar to many of us who have had to deal with inflexible
financial institutions.
<P>
However, the story is complicated by the fact that (by both law and many
legal precedents) Mr Combs is now legally entitled to keep the money.  Banks
must refuse payment within a fixed time period and must serve notice in a
specific manner, both of which Combs' bank has failed to do.  The story
details his research into the legal side of it, as well as his negotiations
with the bank.
<P>
In reading this story, a number of RISKS-related issues came to my
mind:
<UL>
<LI>Combs apparently ascertained that none of the bank tellers would
be held liable for the fault, since the "check" was deposited into
an ATM.  But *someone* had to open those envelopes and verify the
data.
<P>
<LI>Combs comments that he was under the impression that checks of
greater than a certain amount were subject to additional
verification.  That clearly did not happen here.  Why?  No
information is given in the story as to what part of this process
is manual and what is automatic.
<P>
<LI>Through a bit of social engineering, Combs claims to have traced
the flow of the money: apparently his bank got the money from the
clearinghouse bank in Chicago (which also missed the
non-negotiable warning).  It was not until the "check" was sent to
the Federal Reserve bank that it was rejected; the money was then
retrieved by the Chicago bank from Combs' bank which no doubt
assumed it could get the money back from Combs.  However, they
waited 16 days from the time they received notice of their error
and by that time the money was gone from Combs' account.  Who was
responsible for generating notice to Combs?  How did they fail to
take action?  Again, it is unclear how much, if any, of the bank's
procedures are automated.
<P>
<LI>There is also a social RISK in that the bank's treatment of Combs
has clearly exacerbated the problem and generated a good deal of
cost and negative publicity for the bank (as well as the obvious
monetary loss).  Banks, despite being in a customer service
business, have gained a widespread reputation for inflexibility
and for gouging customers for ever-increasing charges and fees.
Combs asks readers to suggest what he should do, and opinion is
clearly against the bank.  As new digital technologies make cash
and location less important, banks RISK putting themselves out of
business altogether if they are not seen to be serving their
customers.
</UL>
It seems clear that a large number of procedures must have broken down in
this story.  It is also interesting that the Federal Reserve, which deals
with a much larger volume of paper, was able to catch an error that two
local banks did not catch.  I confess that I voted for Combs to keep the
money or give it to charity, in large part because of my reaction to the way
the bank treated him and how I have been treated by banks in the past.
<P>
I hope RISKS readers find the story interesting and worth their time to
investigate.

&gt; From: <A HREF="mailto:alex@worldaccess.nl">alex@worldaccess.nl</A> (Alex van Es)<BR>
&gt; Subject: Voting by Phone in the Netherlands<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; Every four year there are elections in the Netherlands, and because of<BR>
&gt; different reasons (bad weather or having to work) many people never<BR>
&gt; even bother to go to the polling booth. In order to make voting easier<BR>
&gt; the Dutch government made it possible last year for people who live in<BR>
&gt; the city of Utrecht to vote at the railway station, so they would be<BR>
&gt; able to do it on their way to work. Yet, many people don't travel by<BR>
&gt; train to work, and even if they do, they might not have the time at<BR>
&gt; the railway station to stand in line. Therefor the government is<BR>
&gt; currently considering the option of voting by phone. People who decide<BR>
&gt; to vote by phone will have to call a special access number.  The<BR>
&gt; number will be one of a 06 (900 type) kind, leading to the call<BR>
&gt; factory in Rotterdam. The call factory is a special exchange for<BR>
&gt; handling up to 1,6 million phone calls an hour.  At this moment most<BR>
&gt; time is invested in making sure the system is safe, and fraud will not<BR>
&gt; be possible.  If this system is going to be used in the future, the<BR>
&gt; Netherlands will be the first country to make televoting for<BR>
&gt; parliamentary elections possible.<BR>

&gt;<BR>
&gt; [TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Suggestions -- and for that matter, full-<BR>
&gt; bodied, substantial proposals -- regarding 'vote by phone' have been<BR>
&gt; made here in the USA also, but nothing has come of it. All the usual<BR>
&gt; excuses ('there would be too much fraud', etc) have been tossed out as<BR>
&gt; reasons it would not work, even though fraud prevention techniques have<BR>
&gt; been provided.  Then there were the privacy freaks who insisted that<BR>
&gt; the tighter the fraud controls, the more likely there would be massive<BR>
&gt; invasions of privacy in the 'voting booth' if controls were established<BR>
&gt; identifying the phone number being used and some other personal identifier<BR>
&gt; such as social security number, etc. They can't seem to understand that<BR>
&gt; there *are* ways to identify the user and validate his *right to vote*<BR>
&gt; without necessarily examining the vote being cast. Nor can they seem to<BR>
&gt; understand that there are competent programmers who share a love for<BR>
&gt; their country and a sense of patriotism which would develop the needed<BR>
&gt; software in an instant -- as fraud-proof and fool-proof as the present<BR>
&gt; manual system if not more so -- if it meant that more Americans would<BR>
&gt; participate in the process. They would do so with a sense of integrity<BR>
&gt; and ethics which would *never* willfully violate anyone's privacy.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; Even starting on a small scale for 'beta testing' purposes seems to be<BR>
&gt; out of the question. The Chicago Board of Election Commissioners (an<BR>
&gt; independent government agency responsible for administering elections of<BR>
&gt; all sorts within the city) has been shown how telephone voting, either<BR>
&gt; with modem and computer or by touch tone buttons alone) would work quite<BR>
&gt; well. They have been shown how, with the cooperation of the banking<BR>
&gt; network, voting could be done at any ATM machine. Of course *not everyone*<BR>
&gt; has an ATM card, and of course *not everyone* has a computer and modem,<BR>
&gt; but these would be two additional ways of 'getting out the vote'. They<BR>
&gt; have been shown how even in conventional voting booth arrangements, a<BR>
&gt; terminal hooked to their central computer could be used to eliminate a<BR>
&gt; huge amount of manual tabulating required, and the fraud that can accompany<BR>
&gt; same, to say nothing of being able to eliminate many of the 'middle-man'<BR>
&gt; election judges found at each polling place.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; They'll hear none of it ... which is odd, considering how desperate they<BR>
&gt; are getting to find voters these days. They do registrations now at all<BR>
&gt; sorts of places -- even at the Cook County Jail where they always get<BR>
&gt; *thousands* of voters each year for selected candidates -- just to round<BR>
&gt; up anyone they can who is willing and wants to bother to vote. They keep<BR>
&gt; harping on the fraud problem using phone voting, but believe me you,<BR>
&gt; nothing compares to the fraud we have here now with the crooked election<BR>
&gt; judges and the low-level Democratic politicians who hang around the<BR>
&gt; polling places on election day, bringing in voters by the bus load from<BR>
&gt; old-people's homes, etc. We could have had tele-voting here years ago had<BR>
&gt; they wanted it. As they say in Chicago, 'vote early and often!'   PAT]

(I was absent of the town at the time of this event, so there may be some
errors, but the core is solid.)
<P>
This week Kuopio, a small town in Finland faced sudden problem with
automated bridges.
<P>
The town is located in the middle of a lake district, wonderful
transportation method during past centuries but a problem if you use cars
instead of boats. The only way from the town to north (to airport among
other places) is through one bridge, which has one (small) openable bridge
for boats.
<P>
Suddenly one morning the bridge, which (as you may have guessed) is
computer-controlled, opened without any reason in the middle of the morning
rush. No-one going to work could get anywhere in the north side of the town.
The bridge was not manned (since it was not in use at that moment) and it
took some time to get anyone there. The bridge computer didn't do anything
and there was no manual button to force closing of the bridge(!!!!!).
<P>
The bridge had to be closed by hand, using crank, by several strong men
turning the wheels. Interviewed representative said that the situation
occurred due to "unpredicted combination of events" (what else :-}) if my
memory does not fail me. (What events they were, I haven't heard of.)
<P>
The risk is old and well-known on this list: Automation of something
without leaving backup-system.
<P>
The good side is that the automatic lights and fences connected to
the bridge-system worked well and warned people that the bridge is
raising, so there was no risk to people.

The NTSB ruled that human error augmented by fatigue probably caused the
crash of a DC-8 cargo plane Feb. 16 at Kansas City International Airport,
killing all three crew members.  [...]  The NTSB found the pilot lost
control of the DC-8 on takeoff, mainly because the flight engineer used
the wrong calculations to determine how fast to supply power to the
engines.  The engineer based his calculations on Fahrenheit temperatures
instead of centigrade as he should have.  [Excerpts from AP reports]

<I>Thu, 31 Aug 95 13:45:38 EDT</I><P>
<P>
I was listening to Boston rock-and-roll station last week when I heard an
advertisement criticizing the Mass Pike's RFP for an electronic toll
collection system.  I called the company, ATCOMM, based in Marblehead,
Massachusetts and spoke with Mike Greenstein to get details:
<P>
Recently, the Mass legislature passed a law requiring the Pike to develop
standards for electronic toll collection.  The Pike responded with a Request
for Proposals (RFP) which substantially narrowed the allowable technical
solutions.
<P>
The Pike's RFP specifically wants to have a centralized accounting
mainframe.  As the driver approaches, an electronic tag (about the size of a
pack of cards) is polled and this is used to debit his account.  The user's
balance is displayed by the tool booth as the driver goes through.
Information about the user's movements are entered immediately to the
centralized database.
<P>
ATCOMM sells a technology which adds a keypad, microprocessor, and an LCD
display to the tag.  The keypad allows the user to ask questions about his
balance at any time, and the LCD displays the remaining balance.  ATCOMM's
technology was specifically excluded by the narrow RFP and so the decided to
go to the radio campaign to make their case, alert the drivers and other
stakeholders that this is an issue.
<P>
I asked Mr. Greenstein about the motivation for the Pike's RFP and he was
unwilling or unable to speculate.
<P>
The Mass Pike is a quasi-independent agency by virtue of its bond contracts
and independent of governmental oversight.  The Pike has been a source of
patronage jobs with mutual backscratching between the Democratic party
government officials and the Pike's authorities.  However, recently, Gov.
Weld has moved to bring the Pike under government control and this will take
place Summer next year.
<P>
According to Mr. Greenstein, there's no concern for privacy of drivers, and
this does not appear to have been the Pike's motivation for issuing the RFP
calling for a centralized database.  ATCOMM could be programmed to ensure
privacy, but currently it is not.  There's some small benefit to ATCOMM's
technology, because the information about the movements of specific cars
through the tolls is not centralized, but kept at the toll facility.
However, this can be collected periodically so there's little difference
from the centralized scheme.  Probably, privacy is not a big selling point
for companies making proposals to governmental RFPs.

<ADDRESS>

<I>Thu, 31 Aug 1995 14:40:54 -0700</I><P>
<P>
Macintosh Application Environment (MAE) is a product that runs on Sun and
Hewlett-Packard workstations, emulating a Macintosh computer under
X-Windows.  It allows 680x0 based Macintosh applications to run on the
workstation accessing the Unix filesystem (including NFS partitions) as if
they were folders and files on the Mac.
<P>
Recently, a secretary who was new to the Mac environment tried to access a
file she had saved from her mailer in Unix from MS-Word under MAE.  She knew
what the name of it was, but wasn't sure *where* it was, so, when she saw
the "Find File" feature in the "Open File" dialog box thought that she would
try it...
<P>
Unfortunately, the workstation was connected to a 256GB NFS fileserver which
MS-Word under MAE dutifully began to search.  Furthermore, neither MAE nor
MS-Word made it apparent how to cancel the request once it was set into
motion.  (Alt-'.', which often works in a Mac environment did nothing.)
Even stranger, the X11 window manager ceased to respond to requests to
pop-up the window's menu to close it.
<P>
Fortunately, there were still some Unix windows around to "kill" the MAE
process--but at a loss of any unsaved information created previously in the
MAE session.
<P>
The RISK?  Perhaps that scale factors were not considered in the design of
the "Find File" feature.  The Mac Style Guide states that all applications
must confirm operations that are either not "undoable" or which may perform
extensive changes.  Perhaps a similar rule should apply: all operations
which may take an extensive amount of time to complete should include a
status window with a cancel operation.
<P>
Or perhaps, the cancel operation *does* exist, but by the time I got there
the X display server was not refreshing the "exposed" regions on the MAE
window (after having been covered and uncovered) so that only a rapidly
changing filename was visible in the middle of an otherwise blank region of
the screen...  In that case, the RISK may be in reliance of X-Windows or
other software emulation to reliably reproduce the emulated hardware
environment.

<LI>Increased network vulnerability.  The key escrow configuration
necessarily increases the likelihood of communications compromise and
improper interception by third parties. Computer crime will skyrocket.
<P>
<LI>Policy incoherence.  The key management needs of business differ sharply
from the real-time intercept plans of law enforcement. The latter has little
to do with the former.
<P>
<LI>Emergency circumstances taps.  The current wiretap law permits the
initiation of a wiretap *without court order* upon a certification that
emergency circumstances exist. If this procedure is built into the CKE
procedure, then there will be *no judicial review* prior to the disclosure
of keys.
<P>
<LI>Complexity.  Has anyone really given thought to how many communications
will be encrypted in 20 years and what the key management requirements will
be to develop a unitary key escrow system to satisfy the government's
concerns?  Its staggering.
<P>
<LI>Cost-benefit. The Bush White House rejected the original digital
telephony bill for this reason.  As time has passed, the argument has
strengthened. The cost to match each new technology with an intercept
capability is rising rapidly.  The benefits of wiretap are falling.
<P>
<LI>Intrusiveness. How will the government monitor compliance by escrow
agents and crypto users with statutory requirements?  Will separate
penalties exist for escrow agents and key holders who negligently fail to
comply with procedures even though there is no evidence of criminal conduct?
If so, law enforcement could "pull over" anyway on the info highway who is
using crypto (the broken tail light problem).
<P>
<LI>The future of PGP.  Will PGP and other non-escrow schemes be permitted if
CKE is adopted? What will be the implications for developers and companies
in the communications industry?  The
<P>
<LI>Ability to Defeat. It will be trivial to send non-interpretable
communications in a key escrow network -- foreign dialect, bury text in
graphics, speak in code!  The bad guys know all about this. They've assumed
their phones were tapped for years.
<P>
<LI>The Long Term. Where does the CKE policy take us in 20 years?  A secure
network where crime is more difficult or a platform for surveillance of
private communications and compromise of business information?
<P>
<LI>Oklahoma City. For more than a year, the White House warned that if
Clipper was not adopted terrible terrorist incidents on US soil similar to
the World Trade Center could not be prevented.  Guess what? It happened and
Clipper, CALEA and all these other dumb ideas didn't prevent the deaths of
170 innocent people. The FBI hadn't even bothered to request a wiretap
warrant for this type of threat (arson, weapons, explosives) since the late
1980s.

A couple of follow-up items regarding the recent head-on crash on
Pittsburgh's HOV lane.
<P>
A Pennsylvania Department of Transportation worker has admitted that he made
a mistake and opened the northbound gate before closing the south- bound
gates.  There is no interlock of any sort to prevent this.  The worker in
question has been fired.
<P>
There apparently is still some question as to whether this led to the accident
or not.
<P>
I mentioned some dual-use ramps downtown.  One of the ramps in question
(near Three Rivers Stadium) actually is a single ramp with an exit and an
entrance.  When the entrance is officially closed there is a barrier across
it.  To enter erroneously (if the barrier is in place) one has to make an
extremely acute right hand turn onto the exit ramp (or be traveling the
wrong way on the major street surrounding the stadium.)  I view this as no
different than the arrangements on many such lanes around the country (e.g.,
the express lanes on the Kennedy Expressway in Chicago.)  The other downtown
ramp in question is at Anderson Street, and as best I can tell from the
photos is a true dual use ramp.  There is no possibility of a barrier at
this location.

The article "US White House Hacked?" describes a series of forged messages
sent to computer users; the sender was supposedly Bill Clinton.  It then
describes the reaction to it, including a dispute about whether the White
House computer was broken into and the forgeries sent from it.
<P>
What surprised me the most was the assumption that sendmail had been used or
even that a break-in had occurred.  Why?  In 1985, we forged a letter from
Opus the Penguin at whitehouse.arpa (which didn't exist) to our office staff
asking for more kippered herring heads at our weekly meetings.  (Those
meetings were in the bloomin' county ...)  All it takes is knowing the SMTP
protocol, and being able to access port 25.  So, given the information in
the article, I'd go with Occam's Razor and assume someone did it that way.

<P>
He claimed the White House uses an old version of software for electronic
mail handling which is obsolete. This program makes it possible to falsify
mail.  Many other System Administrators also use this older version,
leaving the network vulnerable to similar attacks.
<P>
was somewhat depressing; I would think the editor of a computer magazine
would know better than to assert mail forgery is due to an "old version of
software" and not due to the nature of the underlying protocols.

Electronic Engineering Times, 14 Aug 95, has an article entitled "Neural VOR
predicts illness." According to the article, "A complete model of the
vestibular-ocular reflex (VOR) was demonstrated here at the World Congress
on Neural Networks.  The neural-network-based model accurate mimics not only
the behavior of a VOR but the abnormal behavior of damaged VORs.
Separately, the author estimates that at least two months' exposure to
inaccurate virtual-reality simulations could damage health VORs."
<P>
Choose your interpretation... does this highlight a RISK of virtual reality,
or a RISK of drawing real-world conclusions from computer modelling?

An article in the _Boston Globe_ 8 Sept 1995 mentioned that some Sony
miniature satellite dishes have a problem, the nature of which is that the
screen freezes and the audio drops for a second or two.  What raised my
eyebrows was a comment by a Sony official that the company is investigating
the possibility of downloading a fix into the dishes (the problem is
apparently software in nature, with the result being that the tuner doesn't
lock properly).  This would require no action on the part of users, and the
TV set (in the words of the article) would not need to be on when the fix
was downloaded for it to have effect.
<P>
If the official knew that this kind of remote reprogramming facility exists
(as opposed to this person being a PR flack just blowing smoke), well, the
possibilities may be left to the imaginations of my fellow RISKS readers.

The following extract is from an advertisement for a program called WDPass:
<P>
Never lose your passwords again. For many organisations the
major deterrent to using the security features in programs
such as WordPerfect and Lotus 1-2-3 is the fear of
rendering crucial files inaccessible by losing or
forgetting passwords. It is logical to have an immediate
solution to recovering passwords and enhancing security.
<P>
WDPass can immediately recover lost passwords and, thus
access locked files allowing users to feel secure in using
passwords to lock confidential files.
<P>
[Ingram Micro Services advertisement in September 1995 issue
of Connectivity (a newsletter published by the PC User Group)]
<P>
The program claims to work for a variety of Wordperfect, Microsoft, Lotus
and Borland file formats. I find it hard to believe that anyone could read
this advert and think that buying a program that breaks the passwords on all
of their files will make the confidentiality of their data more secure, but
the risk is that out there are some senior executives gullible enough to
think that this allows them to rely entirely on password protection of
documents instead of more traditional locks and keys.

A strange virus is invading documents created with Microsoft's popular Word
program.  While it doesn't destroy files or cause serious damage, it changes
files into templates, which can then be awkward to work with or transfer.
Microsoft is distributing a fix that gets rid of the virus and inoculates
against future contamination, available though help lines or at &lt;
<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com">http://www.microsoft.com</A> &gt;.  (Wall Street Journal 30 Aug 95 B2) Meanwhile,
some would-be Windows 95 users are complaining that they get stuck after the
first disk.  A Microsoft spokeswoman says that a virus already on the users'
computers is at fault -- when it's activated by the first Windows 95 disk,
it prevents any other disks from being installed.  Details on how to fix the
problem will be forthcoming, but meanwhile, users who install the program
via floppy disk should use a virus checker to scan their systems first and
set the write-protect tab on their program disks before installing them.

<P>
In regard to the recent postings on the Word.Macro/WinWord.Concept virus by
Paul Ducklin, Gene Spafford and others, there are some related developments
of note.
<P>
As the postings have said, the concept of macro or interpreted viral
"programs" has been known, experimented with and theorized for some time.  A
major factor in the success of such a virus is a "critical mass" of
compatible systems.  For a time the Rexx language appeared to be poised on
the brink of "success" as a cross platform macro environment, and currently
there is interest in MIME (Multi-purpose Internet Mail Extensions).  Neither
of those systems, however, has yet become a major player.
<P>
By a quirk of chance I have recently reviewed a number of books on
Microsoft's Visual Basic.  All of them have mentioned Microsoft's move
towards Visual Basic for Applications, or VBA.  This is to be a fully
compatible programming/scripting/macro environment replacing and augmenting
the various macro functions in Microsoft products.  Once VBA is implemented,
a macro virus word not merely be able to spread from WinWord to MacWord
documents, but to Excel, Access, FoxPro and a host of other applications as
well.  Indeed, from the information in the books, Microsoft is interested in
licensing VBA to other developers for inclusion in non-MS applications.
<P>
Perhaps it's time to turn off the macro "autoload" capabilities in all
your applications?

<P>
My colleague, Chuck Weinstock, recently reported to this forum a terrible
accident that happened here in Pittsburgh, PA, regarding a head-on collision
between two vehicles travelling in opposite directions on a high occupancy
vehicle (HOV) lane.  Several people were killed in this accident, and two
individuals remain hospitalized.  This HOV lane is supposedly only open in
one direction at a time.
<P>
There are three new developments in this incident, according to last night's
news:
<OL>
<LI>There have been news reports of at least three other incidents of cars
travelling in both directions simultaneously in the HOV lane--three more
potential head-on crashes occurring just since the fatal accident last week.
<P>
<LI>An employee of the state department of transportation (PennDoT) who had
been responsible for manually opening and closing the gates and turning
on/off the signs to control access to the HOV lane was fired yesterday.  His
attorney reportedly admitted that he had opened the south end of the lane
before closing the north end (in violation of procedure) and then lied to
investigators by claiming that he had followed procedures.  There may be
criminal charges filed against the former PennDoT employee.
<P>
<LI>PennDoT reportedly is planning to spend a million dollars to upgrade the
control system and signage for this HOV lane.  According to the news
reports, it sounds like they are planning to put into a central location a
set of manually-operated switches to control the gates and signs, much as
they are manually controlled in the field by a single operator now.
</OL>
IMHO, I'd have serious concerns about this sort of "automated" control
system coupled with the use of a manual checklist. The same potential
problem for human error or failure to follow the checklist could still
exist, if the appropriate safety mechanisms are not built in.  The only
difference is that the problem has now merely moved from the physical gate
and sign devices to a control panel in a central facility.  All one needs to
do is look at the prior literature on human error in control rooms to
validate this concern.
<P>
For example, in the nuclear power industry, estimates of human error (as a
percentage of system failures) range from twenty to sixty-five percent
[Moray88].  Within a particular type of system, operating power plants, 15
to 30% of reported events occurring during operation involved a human error
component [Griffon-Fouco87].  Of these events:
<UL>
<LI>approximately 80% occur during operation and periodic tests
<LI>about 50% occur in the control room
<LI> almost 40% of these errors are evidenced by inappropriate user
actions [Griffon-Fouco87].
</UL>
Related studies [Meclot &amp; Griffon-Fouco88] have indicated a number of deep
causes of these human failures.  Although sixty-two percent of the
significant incidents can be attributed to the ergonomics of the workplace
and the organization of the work, another fifty-six percent can be
attributed to failure to follow procedures (26%), content of procedures
(16%), task complexity (11%) and the form of the procedures (3%).
<P>
Taken from these prior studies, procedure following in a control room is
still far from perfect reliability--human error can still occur.  I hope
that PennDoT does more than just add in switches to manually control the HOV
lane, and also incorporates appropriate interlocks into their control room.

<P>
Johnson's earlier book, "Computer Ethics" (cf. BKCMPETH.RVW), may be considered
the preeminent work in the field.  This collection of papers, co-edited with
Nissenbaum, enhances, but does not extend, that prior work.
<P>
Ethical problems may be divided into a number of groups in the computer world.
Three stand out in particular.  Some dilemmas arise from a conflict of agreed
"good" values.  These are the situations described in moral scenarios:  should
the poor man steal the medicine necessary to cure his wife from the inventor
who will not reduce his price.  A second class have to do with unknown or
unpredictable situations.  In the non-computer world, an example would be
megaprojects of unknown environmental impact.  The third grouping would include
situations where a vast majority hold to a certain standard of behaviour, while
a minority act otherwise.  Cults and certain brands of terrorism would fall
into this category.
<P>
Most non-computer ethical discussion is directed at the first class of
problems, and most works on morality in computing follow suit.  The articles in
this book go a bit further.  Chapter five, and parts of six and seven, raise
issues related to group two problems.  The ethical analysis is, however,
limited and tentative.  The inclusion of articles by Stallman, and Dorothy
Denning's interview with Frank Drake, would seem to be an attempt to discuss
the third type of issues.  The bulk of the work, though, speaks with a single
voice from the position of conventional morality, yet fails to address
realistically the problem of bringing outsiders into the fold.
<P>
The papers seem to have a fair distribution between academic and popular works.
Be forewarned:  some of the latter have a Saturday-magazine level of accuracy
to the information.  Non-American readers should note a heavy reliance on
American case and constitutional law, although most discussions are
sufficiently detailed as to raise common law issues.

<P>
Is software quality testing really effective or just a waste of time?  The
skeptics conclude that it is an exercise in futility to try to measure the
reliability and safety of these complex systems under all critical
circumstances.  They contend that quality assurance comes only through a
strict adherence to rigorous development process models.  In this
groundbreaking book, Michael Friedman and Jeffrey Voas dispel that myth.
They demonstrate that extremely accurate, cost-effective software quality
testing can now be a reality, thanks to powerful new analytical tools.
Central to the approach outlined in Software Assessment is an assessment
optimization technique called testability analysis.  Pioneered at the
College of William and Mary and NASA by Jeffrey Voas, testability analysis
predicts the likelihood that latent bugs will be detected through testing.
Because no test oracle is required, testability analysis can be automated.
The book offers a balanced presentation of theory and practice.  Featuring
exhaustive coverage of the foundations of reliability, safety, and
testability, it uses real-world examples, illustrations, and clear
descriptions to explore all of the latest techniques for assessing those
qualities.

</ADDRESS>
<I>Fri, 8 Sep 1995 22:11:13 -0700</I><P>
NIST (the National Institute of Standards and Technology) held a two-day
public meeting on 6-7 September, 1995 to discuss Software Key Escrow as a
possible means of achieving export of cryptography.
<P>
In the morning of 7 Sept, Goeff Greiveldinger of the Department of Justice
gave a description of the kinds of crimes which DoJ wants to use wiretapping
to solve.  He closed this litany of lawbreaking with the assertion that
software manufacturers don't want to provide products which allow such
lawbreakers to keep their criminal evidence hidden from law enforcement.
<P>
I'm sorry to disillusion you, Geoff, but I *do* want to make such systems.
<P>
Would you have Ryder stop renting trucks because some terrorist decided to
fill one with explosives and kill many innocent children?  Would you have
Americans stop making automobiles because bank robbers have been known to
use cars for getaways?  Would you have all new buildings constructed with
FBI microphones in every wall because some criminals meet in private rooms
in order to plan crimes?
<P>
When an American company sweeps its conference room for bugs, finds some and
destroys them, it doesn't matter whether those bugs were planted by industrial
spies or the FBI.  The company has a right to eliminate them.  When that
company ties two such conference rooms together by video-conference equipment
and encrypts the line between them using strong link encryption, it is
performing the same defensive operation in cyberspace.  It is protecting
itself from spies and it doesn't matter that the wiretaps it frustrates might
be illegal ones by industrial spies or legal ones by the FBI.  The right to
attempt to achieve privacy is a long-standing one in this country and not one
to allow to be lost.
<P>
When I design and build systems for privacy for my customers, I am providing
products for law-abiding, honest people.  I am aware of criminals, of
course.  Criminals are the threats against whom I protect my customers.
These criminals are usually not in the government but that doesn't mean that
I believe I should offer my honest customers up for a strip-search in
cyberspace.  The law enforcement agencies of this free country have no right
to expect blanket access to the ciphertext of citizens.  It will take
legislation to get that right and I will do everything in my power to keep
such legislation from passing.  Barring such legislation, I will make sure
that honest American citizens have cryptography with which to attempt to
maintain their privacy, even from the government.  We have the right to
attempt to keep a secret from government agencies and continuous
demonstration of that right is an important part of this free country.
<P>
On the other hand, I am sympathetic to law-enforcement officers.  I have
several friends in that business.  I have asked my friends and acquaintances
who do surveillance (2 IRS agents investigating organized crime for tax
evasion; 2 undercover cops in Boston's highest drug neighborhood; 1 DEA
agent in the midwest) if they ever encounter encrypted communications or
files.  They don't.  Neither does anyone in their offices.  Of course, even
if they did it would remain so important to preserve our right to attempt to
keep secrets from the government that their frustration would just have to
be accepted.  The fact that this isn't a real problem makes my decision that
much easier.  I am left with no moral qualms at all.
<P>
In summary, criminals are so few that I will not design for them.  I will not
treat my vast majority of honest users as if they were criminals just because
some criminal might someday use my product and frustrate you.
<P>
ObRisk: We run the risk of losing our fundamental right to attempt to keep a
secret from the government -- a practice we need to preserve in order to
protect ourselves from criminals in cyberspace.  There are powerful forces in
the US government attempting to cajole us into giving up that right.

&gt; ... there's a bunch of people on the lawn, and they all look<BR>
&gt; shocked, or scared or just out of place.  It seems that there has been a<BR>
&gt; major breakdown with the new computer system and schedules for the<BR>
&gt; students are currently nonexistent.  So we are all turned away and given<BR>
&gt; another day of summer.  I guess that's not so bad, but the complete lack<BR>

Certainly not the first such item seen in RISKS (Coke machines...), but
you've got to admit that taking 6 months to identify the source of calls
arriving every 90 minutes has to be some kind of record!

Persistent oil tank hassles woman
<P>
BILLERICA, Massachusetts - For six months, a woman thought she was in
tele-marketing hell.  Every 90 minutes, her phone would ring, but the caller
would never say a word.
<P>
The phone company eventually traced the calls to an abandoned oil tank in
Maryland. It was rigged to call the oil company when the oil level was low,
but the phone number was scrambled and it called her instead.

Computer trouble results in fatal fall
<P>
NEWARK, Del. (AP) -- A University of Delaware student fell 13 floors to
his death out of his dormitory window, apparently after he lost his balance
when he put his fist through the glass in anger over computer trouble.
<P>
Robert Keepers, 19, of Spotswood, N.J., went through the 5-foot
double-pane window early Saturday.
<P>
Keepers "got up and ran around the room in a pique of anger" and struck
the window with his fist, said Tim Brooks, dean of students, citing the
account of two students who were in Keeper's room during the accident.
<P>
Well, I had never considered this risk of incorrectly operating equipment
before; however, I have no need to fear.  My dormitory window is a scant
four feet above ground.

&gt;    CROOKS NETTED THOUSANDS FROM FAKE CASH MACHINE  COURT<BR>
&gt;    By Melvyn Howe, PA News<BR>
&gt;  A gang of fraudsters chalked up a criminal first when they installed a<BR>
&gt;  bogus High Street cash point machine, a court heard today.<BR>
&gt;  The highly convincing piece of equipment, set in front of a fake<BR>
&gt;  mortgage broking business, "enticed" scores of card holders to vainly<BR>
&gt;  try to withdraw money in an enterprise that eventually netted the<BR>
&gt;  crooks at least 120,000 pounds.
<UL>
<LI>Account numbers and PINs were recorded, and transferred by modem to the
gang.
<P>
<LI>Hit at least three locations in the London area.
<P>
<LI>The ATM's screen apologized, "Please remove your card and try later."
The ATM even had a notice that, if tampered with, an alarm would ring at the
local police station.
<P>
<LI>Monthly statements tipped users they had been defrauded.
<P>
<LI>The prosecutor said the criminals had manufactured false cash cards,
programmed them with the information from the fake ATM and travelled
throughout the UK withdrawing money.
<P>
<LI>One victim lost L1,500.  At least 100 victims.  Total losses L120,000
over five weeks.
<P>
&gt;    He added: "As far as police are aware this is the first time that such a<BR>
&gt;    particular kind of fraud has been perpetrated in this country."<BR>
<P>
<LI>Three arrested.  One has cut a plea bargain, two have plead innocent.
</UL>
&gt;    The court heard an enormous amount of detailed planning went into the<BR>
&gt;    fraud.  (The prosecutor) claimed a "front" company was used to buy<BR>
&gt;    parts for the bogus cashpoint machine.
<P>
A shop was then rented and a sign put up outside stating: "Hambro UK.
Mortgages, design mortgages, pensions. Halifax appointed representative".
Office furniture was installed and flowers and pot plants used to provide a
further convincing touch.
<P>
&gt;    A genuine Halifax Building Society branch nearby received many<BR>
&gt;    complaints that it's other cashpoint machine was not working, and<BR>
&gt;    in some cases even keeping the cards.  Staff investigated, immediately<BR>
&gt;    realised what was going on and called in the police ...

This initiative has been out for a while but it only now occurred to me that
it is in the subject matter for comp.risks. Endless newsgroup discussions
and flame wars are certainly a computer risk; yet the potential of News (as
forums such as this one have demonstrated) is great and it is a pity to see
it wasted.
<P>
To see if I can help improve the situation I have started a modest program
called SELF-DISCIPLINE. In keeping with the spirit of the program, which is
to maximize signal and minimize noise, I will not describe SELF-DISCIPLINE

%T   "Building Internet Firewalls"
<P>
Cheswick and Bellovin's "Firewalls and Internet Security" (cf. BKFRINSC.RVW)
will continue to be seen as the classic reference with the seriously
technical crowd.  Chapman and Zwicky, however, have here created the first
reference for the more normal run of system administrators: those whose
lives do not revolve around hacking the UNIX kernel.
<P>
Part one could almost stand as a separate book, itself.  It is an
introduction to firewalls.  More, it is a very down-to-earth and practical
guide to evaluating security needs and planning for security systems and
practices.  The writing is completely clear, and the explanations
first-rate.  Chapter four, on firewall architectures, is a perfect
introduction for the manager who, while not having a technical background,
must lead or administer a security project.
<P>
Part two gets into more technical details of firewall construction and the
communications needs for Internet services.  The writing, though, is still
clear and easily accessible to any intelligent reader.  Part three covers
maintenance and administrative work.  Appendices list information and
software resources as well as a brief introduction to TCP/IP basics.
<P>
This is the first book that truly explains, to the non-specialist, the
various factors and functions involved in firewall choice and construction.
For those building their own and for those evaluating vendor proposals, this
book is a must.

The TELECOM Digest's Editor wrote:
<P>
&gt; They'll hear none of it ... which is odd, [...]  PAT
<P>
Not odd at all.  The editor answered his own question.  There are many
people in office today who know they got there due to fraudulent voting
practices.  (No reason to name names, but there are still two seats in the
US House of Representatives being contested due to fraud, and one state
governership from last year's elections.)  There have been many such
"elected officials" in the past, and there will be more in the future.
<P>
So there are two types of voting systems, those that work privately and
without risk of fraud, and those where fraud is impossible to prove in
hindsight, and often impossible to stop on the spot.  There are very, very
few of the former in use anywhere in the world, mostly in uncontested
elections to corporate boards of directors. :-(
<P>
If we really want trustworthy voting systems, someone other than
the politicians will have to impose them.
<P>
And now to relate this to comp.risks.  It is getting to be much harder to
cheat.  Exit polls and computer based vote projections can show where the
votes were diddled and by how much.  There have been many incidents around
the world where the incumbents resorted to force when massive fraud was
revealed by exit polling, international observers, etc.  In some cases, like
the Philippines, where Cory Aquino was declared the winner in the exit polls
and the streets, and the official vote tallies ignored, the net effect has
been beneficial.  But in many other cases the result has been years of
bloodshed.  Some leaders have even started wars to avoid (or win) elections
they couldn't win otherwise.  (No, not Maggie, the Argentinian Generals.
Margaret Thatcher just called an immediate election once the war was over
because she was well ahead in the polls.)
<P>
If we don't insist that the quality of the actual voting procedures be at
least as trustworthy as the widely available means for predicting the
results, all we will be encouraging is further bloodshed.  (And we also need
to insist on a diversity of sources of predictions.)  Right now the polls
you see and hear in the news before elections have an expected error of 3 to
6 per cent.  The results of exit polls are much more accurate, usually in
the 1/2 to 1 per cent range.  This has resulted in a strange marriage of
convenience with a single organization doing almost all the exit polls and
vote tabulations in the US, with the TV networks and the politicians as
customers.  (The different networks base their own projections on the same
data.  There have been lawsuits by smaller parties because their results
have not been included in the published data.)

Hey, you're impuning my reputation, puny though it may be!  We've been
thrashing this out in some of the private virus discussion groups, and it is
too a virus!  Read and infected Word doc, and it infects your Word macro
space.  It writes itself (OK, selves, seeing as how it has various parts) to
the NORMAL.DOT file, and gets stored between sessions.  Once the macro space
ahs been infected, any files saved with the FileSaveAs function are infected
themselves.  Send somebody an E-mail message over the MSN, and in one mouse
click, they download, invoke Word, open the message and infect themselves,
without ever having their fingers leave the rodent.

Must disagree. Within its target environment (default WORD 6.0 or better),
it satisfies the difference between a "trojan horse" and a "virus" in that it
is able to propagate. Such an AutoOpen macros could be a trojan, but in this
easy-to-block case (and both of MS's fixes, WD1215 and the later one whose
number I forget seem to target this virus specifically - have looked at 1215
but not the other so caveat y'all).
<P>
I would be surprised if this is anything more than a "15 minutes of fame" but
does point out the value of turning the default "do anything you want without
notice" off. ("Prompt to save Normal" &amp; "DisableAutoMacros" are good starting
points - of course if you disable these, the MS "fix" won't work...
<P>
BTW, essentially this is traceable to ANSI bombs and programmable PF keys on
the VT-100 (had to put the sequence in a companion .com (DCL) but have seen
it done) so capability dates back at least to the late 1970's. Same thing
would work on a uVax as well as a 780 so guess that made it
"cross-platform". And then there was the VT-103...

... Quoting a bit from Gene Spafford's mention of the "virus"
on VIRUS-L:
<P>
&gt; The virus adds several new macros to the global macro pool: "AAAZA0",<BR>
&gt; "AAAZFS", "Payload" and one entitled "FileSaveAs".  The virus is<BR>
&gt; activated in an infected file when you choose the "Save As" feature in<BR>
&gt; the "File" menu and the virus macro is run.  The altered macros are<BR>
&gt; then saved with the file, and may be saved in the global template file<BR>
&gt; as well.
<P>
If it stores itself in the global template file, then it can be loaded every
time Word starts. Hence, it has "infected" Word, and can cause any documents
saved ("FileSaveAs") to carry the "virus", which will then execute the viral
loader if these documents are loaded in another copy of Word.
<P>
This seems to make a good case for being a virus: infection of a host and
the ability to reproduce toward the goal of infecting other hosts.

I was quite distressed to read the article in the <A HREF="/Risks/17.32.html">RISKS-17.32</A> by Alan
Wexelblat about a man (Combs) who deposited a fake check for $95000 and
withdrew the money.  Clearly, the system failures in the case are worth
discussing.  But I wonder how many readers were taken aback as I was by the
amoral slant to the article?  On the face of it, Combs appears no more than
a common thief, and the only "service" I can imagine the bank owes to him is
to have him arrested for passing bad checks.
<P>
Regardless of any legal quirks, or how the bank treated him, the test is
simple: did he knowingly take money not belonging to him, and keep it?  If
so, morally he is a thief, regardless of what a lawyer might make of it.

Concerning the ban on self-disabling software, two questions occur to me:
<UL>
<LI>I wonder how often such software uses a simplistic, date-driven algorithm
that is triggered if an operator mistypes the system date.  And using other
measures (such as total number of invocations) could lead to wildly
differing period-'til-disablement values for different users, according to
their work habits.
<P>
<LI>It occurs to me that it might be argued that buggy software is itself a
form of self-disablement.  I wonder how hard a good lawyer would have to
work to argue that this law makes software with non-trivial bugs illegal
_per se_.

While I don't know anything about this particular program, I did hear
recently about a program with similar functions. The following may be
apocryphal, as I have not been able to verify details and did not hear the
story from anyone who claimed to have experienced it firsthand.
<P>
The marketers of the alleged program found an interesting problem: it worked
so fast that it destroyed users' confidence in the security of their
passwords, with the result that they just turned them off and didn't buy any
more copies of the password recovery program.
<P>
The reported marketing response was ingenious: the program's developer
inserted a no-op loop into the password-recovery process so that instead of
taking about a second, it took several minutes.  This made it look like the
program was doing something hard; the users liked the modified program much
better and didn't lose confidence in the built-in "security" of their
applications.
<P>

Duncan Booth &lt;<A HREF="mailto:Duncan@rcp.co.uk">Duncan@rcp.co.uk</A>&gt; posted a note about a product called WDPass
that claims to crack passwords for a number of products.  I suspect that, by
reducing the risk of lost passwords, this would indeed increase the
likelyhood that careless users would use password protection, and the
increased use of passwords would improve security in the face of casual
browsing and similar common but low-level threats.  At the same time, the
product clearly exposes the well known (at least in technical circles)
triviality of the password protection schemes used on many common products.
<P>
&gt; The program claims to work for a variety of Wordperfect, Microsoft, Lotus<BR>
&gt; and Borland file formats.
<P>
If the product works against the password protection scheme used by Lotus
Ami Pro, I want to hear about it.  That scheme is one I invented, and the
last I heard, it was still pretty strong.  Has someone found a better than
brute force attack for it?

You're assuming that everyone will realize this product exists.  A
knowledgeable attacker would not be deterred by the encryption features of
existing software, but it might be enough to deter a casual attacker.  But
at the same time management might downplay the encryption features from fear
of a subordinate trying to "hide" crucial information.
<P>
&gt;the risk is that out there are some senior executives gullible enough to<BR>
&gt;think that this allows them to rely entirely on password protection of<BR>
&gt;documents instead of more traditional locks and keys.
<P>
Alas, many environments don't even have those "traditional locks and keys."
Oh, the offices will be locked at night and care will be applied when
deciding which employees get keys... but then they'll have minimum wage temp
employees come in to remove the trash.
<P>
In this case the _only_ effective protection in place might be the
encryption provided by those packages.  A knowledgeable attacker will be
prepared, but it might be enough to stump a compromised custodial staff
member.

CNN reported that ATC primary computers and their backup went down for
several hours the morning of 12 Sep 1995 in Chicago.  Schedule delays of
over an hour were common.  Channel 9 local news in Washington, DC, reported
collision alarms going off when an American Eagle plane and private jet came
within 3.5 miles of each other during the downtime.

Two Oakland men have apparently been ripping off (literally and
figuratively) freeway emergency call boxes, reverse-engineering the serial
numbers, and programming them into cellular phones, which they either sold
or used themselves.  More than $40,000 in cellular-phone calls (some from
New York) were attributable to those serial numbers.  About 200 call boxes
worth $250,000 were involved (mostly in Alameda County).  The remaining call
boxes have now been reprogrammed to be able to dial only 911, which might
end that scam --- unless they can be subsequently re-reprogrammed...

"George, is it possible to live without taking risks? I mean,
without taking any risk at all."<BR>
"No."<BR>
"Why?"<BR>
"Because almost everything we do has some danger to it, even if
it's a small one."<BR>
"Exactly.  Every time you get up, there is a risk that termites
have eaten holes in the floor and it's no longer strong enough to
hold you, or you might slip in the bathtub, or that you might get
hit by a car crossing the street, or your deodorant might be too
strong and give you a bad rash for a while.<BR>
"For most things we do, there is a tiny, infinitesimal risk of
death or injury.  For some things, the risk is higher.  The range of
risks run from the chance of dying from a heart attack, due to
strain caused as a direct result of moving your arm, while brushing
your teeth, being nil, all the way to stepping into an operating
blast furnace, the risk of death being certainty.  Usually we do not
weigh the risk, because it is too insignificant to matter.  But if
there is a significant risk, you must decide if you can afford the
cost.  Got me so far?"<BR>
"Yes."<BR>
"Risks do not always involve life and death issues.  Every action
you take has some risks involved.  When we have to do something about
those risks, we call that the consequences surrounding the action.
Nonetheless, it is important that people understand that actions have
consequences, and that they must take responsibility for their actions.
This means they are acting in a manner that shows them to be responsible
people."<BR>
"All human misery stems from one cause, and one cause only:
someone not taking responsibility for their actions. The result of
this directly causes that responsibility to be borne by someone
else, or that their default caused the responsibility to not be
borne by anyone, and the consequences of that decision indirectly
causes someone else to bear the consequences of their act, and they
suffer for other people's irresponsibility."<BR>
"In any undertaking, as long as you consider the what the
consequences of your actions are, and are willing to take
responsibility for them, and are in fact capable of taking on
those consequences, then you are acting in a responsible manner.
You are still acting in a responsible manner even if you find out
you were wrong either way, as long as you took into consideration
all outcomes that could, by any reasonable analysis of the
matter, be expected from those actions."

New Software Is Blamed for Networking Problems at a Few Universities<BR>
By SIMSON L. GARFINKEL, Special to the Mercury News<BR>
&copy; 1995, Simson L. Garfinkel<BR>
Permission granted for electronic redistribution on the Internet
<P>
Microsoft's new Windows 95 operating system is playing havoc with the
computer networks at a few of the nation's universities, prompting at least
one university to issue a policy restricting students and faculty from
running Windows 95 on its computer network.
<P>
University administrators say problems have occurred when a user running
Windows 95 connects that machine to a network running the Novell Netware
operating system, one of the most popular versions for allowing a group of
computers to operate collectively, or over a ''network.''
<P>
Windows 95 has a new network feature that allows computer users to share
information stored on each other's computers. The problem, according to
people who have worked with the software, is that a computer running
Windows 95 can be configured to masquerade as an organization's Novell
Netware server, or centralized ''control'' computer. When that occurs, the
computers trying to talk with the server shut down, or ''crash,''
university officials say.
<P>
Utah State University already has instituted a policy forbidding its
students and staff from using a specific type of Netware networking feature
that's built into Windows 95.
<P>
''We have published a policy that we will come and break your kneecaps if
you do this, so please don't,'' said Joe Doupnik, a professor of electrical
engineering at Utah State University in Logan, Utah.
<P>
Besides Utah State, representatives from the University of Kansas and some
other institutions have reported similar problems.
<P>
So far, no corporations have reported any troubles with the popular new
operating system, according to a Microsoft spokesman. That suggests,
according to computer experts, that it is only in less regulated
environments -- such as college campuses -- where there may be problems. At
larger corporations, the computer network is closely managed by experts who
would know how to avoid the traps that could lead to the woes being
experienced at some universities.
<P>
The problem reported by the universities has to do with the inner workings
of Novell's Netware operating system. Under normal circumstances, when a
desktop computer running Novell's client software is turned on, one of the
first things that the computer does is send a request out on the network
for the nearest Novell server, said Doupnik. Under normal circumstances,
the nearest Netware server responds to this request and tells the client
computer how to go about accessing files on the organization's local area
network.
<P>
But when a Windows 95 computer configured to act like a server is attached
to the same network, Doupnik said that computer can respond first. The
result is that the person who has requested information from the network
ends up with an unresponsive, or dead, computer. For the user running a
computer with the Windows 95 operating system, nothing appears to be wrong.
<P>
Microsoft, meanwhile, denies that the problem exists.
<P>
''We have done extensive testing with Novell's products,'' said Mike Conte,
a group manager with Microsoft's Personal Systems Division. ''There was an
issue . . . during the beta [test period], but actually the problem has
been fixed for months.
<P>
''Normally, people won't encounter this issue at all, because it won't be
turned on,'' Conte said, referring to the program that turns on the
specific networking function. If users do turn it on, he said, they need to
specify a ''preferred network'' for Novell Netware clients to use. Windows
95 will then automatically send the client's requests to the appropriate
Netware server.
<P>
But computer system administrators -- and Novell itself -- disagree. Novell
and Microsoft are competitors in the lucrative networking software market.
<P>
William Donahoo, director of product marketing at Novell, said his company
has offered to work with Microsoft, but the Washington-based king of
desktop operating systems has rebuffed Novell's overtures.
<P>
''We have several license programs and computability testing programs,''
Donahoo said. ''They have not wanted to participate. They have wanted to do
it on their own.''
<P>
Donahoo said there is a way for system administrators to prevent system
crashes, but representatives from the universities say they have been
unable to resolve the problem.
<P>
For example, Michael McGinnis, a network consultant at the University of
Kansas in Lawrence, said a student at that university on Friday caused
havoc on the network system when he tried to hook up to the network after
he had installed Windows 95.
<P>
McGinnis said it took him and two other computer consultants three hours to
track down the culprit.
<P>
''I have had the problem, and I have gotten e-mail messages from system
administrators at three other universities who have seen the problem,''
McGinnis said.
<P>
McGinnis called Microsoft for technical support. ''I spent an hour on the
phone, and couldn't get to anyone at Microsoft who knew anything about this
problem. I talked to one tech support guy who said he didn't know of any
such problem. He gave me a phone number of another Windows 95 Networking
Support Group at Microsoft. I have not called them yet, because I didn't
have authorization to spend $35.''
<P>
About this last point, McGinnis is particularly resentful. ''We bought 375
copies and they won't let me talk to a tech support person unless I pay
them.''

I heard this story from someone who worked for a French company, they had a
problem with a program on punched cards written for them by a US subsidiary.
The programs never worked when loaded in France but the US systems house
swore blind that they did at their end.  Eventually, in exasperation,
someone followed the working set of cards from the US to France.  At French
customs, they observed a customs official remove a few cards at random from
the deck.  Apparently, the french customs are entitled to remove a sample
from any bulk item (such as grain), so a few cards from a large consignment
shouldn't matter, should it?
<P>
[Later posts by Joe Morris and Tom Rauschenback confirmed the story.  Mr.
Morris said that the company was Oak Ridge National Labs, and the cards
contained unclassified data.  Mr. Rauschenback said that the story
originally came from him.  RMacN]

I read the article on SELF-DISCIPLINE.  While I agree with the basic thrust
of it, I feel that it is too organized and legalistic.  The kinds of things
that are addressed in this proposal need to be internalized; they need to be
second-nature.  I also would not be surprised to see news.discipline, if
created, become subject to endless wrangling about questions like whether
posting A is really following the rules or not.
<P>
On the other hand I like Tom Van Vleck's guidelines (cited at the end of
Bertrand Meyer's SELF-DISCIPLINE www page).  I think one way to internalize
good behavior is to read moralizing preachments like Van Vleck's over and
over.  Eventually some of it sinks in and BECOMES second-nature.
<P>
The basic problem, in my view, with Usenet news is that people have stopped
thinking of the person at the other end of the wire as a human being.  I
think it's the same (technologically induced) depersonalization we
experience behind the wheel of an auto.  The will to power takes over.

People only tend to encrypt what they consider to be `valuable' data.  This
means that the cracker can say `oh look... encrypted data, must be valuable'
and so has a go at it.

If people encrypted communications as a matter of course, the return on
investment would be far lower, as the cracker would decrypt a lot of

Most Microsoft programs *require* that one of the floppy disks be

among others, record the owner's name and company on one disk during
the first installation, and subsequent installations from the same set

Apropos of Patrick Combs' $95,093.35 junk check follies, a bank in Chicago
reported a $520,000 deposit to the account of Glenn Turner's late mother.
He thought it was a mistake, checked with the bank, who reported it was not
an error.  After three weeks, he started spending it, racking up $189,000 in
expenditures.
<P>
Now a SECOND bank, the one that made the mistake, is suing him for the money
back.  His lawyer says that bank should be accountable; based on reading the
information Combs discovered on his odyssey, that appears to be likely.
<P>
The RISK is an old one: reliance on systems over common sense.  In this
case, since his mother had died, Mr. Turner might reasonably be able to
claim that he didn't know every detail of her finances and thus was able to
reasonably assume that, since the bank had verified the deposit, it was
legit.

Bill Linke said he thought the person who deposited this check was a thief
and should be treated as such.  While he has a point, the fact that Mr Combs
has not spent the money (as he reports) tempers my opinion of him as a thief
and makes me want to point a finger at the company that issued the 'check.'
IMO he did not pass a bad check - he deposited a check that "met all nine of
the legal criteria for a valid bearer document."  If that is not intent to
deceive (i.e. fraud) I don't know what is.  I think the company that issued
this check should be slammed for the 95k.  Then maybe the torrents of sleazy

I have to disagree.  I believe that what Combs has done is a form of civil
disobedience, not against the government per se, but against a system which
clearly has flaws which need to be addressed, and which may very well be
addressed as a result of his actions.
<P>
In particular, if the check he deposited was in fact legally negotiable,
then the Federal check clearinghouse should not have rejected it (or, going
back further, the company that sent out the mass mailing should not have
sent out a negotiable check).  If the check was *not* negotiable, then that
should have been caught by Combs' bank or by the regional check
clearinghouse which allowed the check to clear.  Letting a $95,000 check of
questionable validity clear is not a minor problem, it's a *major* problem
(before disputing that, stop to think for a minute if you really think your
bank would catch it if a crooked cashier at the grocery store made a copy of
one of your checks and used the resulting information to forge another check
on your account for a large amount of money).  Without something like what
Combs did, I'm quite certain that the banks and check clearinghouses would
simply continue to ignore the problem for as long as they can.
<P>
A basic principle of civil disobedience is that those who engage in it
aren't supposed to profit from it.  So, you're right, it's not OK for Combs
to say, "Nyah, nyah, you missed the deadline, so I'm going to keep the
money!"  However, so far, that isn't what he has done.  He has kept the
cashier's check in a safe-deposit box, while trying to get people with
authority to acknowledge that the error occurred and do something to ensure
that the same error doesn't happen again.
<P>
Therefore, as long as the bank and/or the clearinghouse system refuse to
concede that they screwed up and to specify in detail what they've done to
prevent such screwups in the future, I think that Combs should leave that
check sitting in the safe-deposit box (except, of course, that he should
take it out, cash it, and put the money into a new cashier's check
periodically, so that the check doesn't expire).  Combs (and, more
generally, we the consumers) have no leverage on The System to force it to
fix itself, unless we can wield the threat of hitting it in the pocketbook,
and that's what Combs is doing.

<P>
Since he has the $95000 on a cashier's check that hasn't been cashed yet,
the bank still has the actual money.
<P>
The legal quirks are there to protect people from each other should one of
them try to defraud the other. That they also work in quite interesting
ways otherwise is another matter.
<P>
If I were he, I'd return the check -- IF the bank actually takes steps to
make sure this nonsense doesn't happen again. The info on his Web page says
he met with one of the Bank's lawyers a week ago and they reached some kind
of agreement (bank gets the check in return for complying with a list of
demands or whatever -- the Web page didn't specify). We'll see what happens
next. I've asked him via E-mail to clarify what these "ten things [he]
wanted" are.
<P>
Anyway, and again IMHO, it's a Good Thing that this mistake actually hurts
the bank. That's a good way to improve the odds that it won't happen
again. (I was going to write "make sure" instead of "improve the odds" at
first, but common sense prevailed...)
