<TITLE>1997 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy Call for Papers</TITLE>
<pre>
                           CALL FOR PAPERS
   
1997 IEEE Symposium on                              May 4-7, 1997
Security and Privacy                            Oakland, California
  
                             sponsored by
  IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Security and Privacy
                         in cooperation with
    The International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR)

The Symposium on Security and Privacy has, for 16 years, been the
premier forum for the presentation of developments in computer
security and for bringing together researchers and practitioners in the
field.  We seek to build on this tradition of excellence by
re-emphasizing work on engineering and applications while maintaining
our interest in theoretical advances. 

We continue to seek to broaden the scope of the Symposium.  We want to
hear not only about new theoretical results, but also about the design
and implementation of secure systems in specific application areas and
about policies relating to system security.  We are particularly
interested in papers on policy and technical issues relating to privacy
in the context of the information infrastructure, papers that relate
software and system engineering technology to the design of secure
systems and papers on hardware and architectural support for secure
systems. Papers or Panels which discuss the application of theory to
practice which describe not only the successes but the failures and
the lessons learned are of special interest.

Topics on which papers and panel sessions proposals are invited
include, but are not limited to, the following:

        Commercial and Industrial Security,
        Security and other Critical System Properties,
        Secure Systems,
        Distributed Systems,
        Network Security,
        Database Security,
        Data Integrity,
        Access Controls,
        Information Flow ,
        Security Verification,
        Viruses and Worms,
        Security Protocols,
        Authentication,
        Biometrics,
        Smartcards,
        Auditing,
        Intrusion Detection,
        Privacy Issues,
        Policy Modeling

A continuing feature of the symposium will be a session of 5-minute
talks. We want to hear from people who are advancing the field in the
areas of system design and implementation, but may lack the resources
needed to prepare a full paper. Abstracts of these talks will be
distributed at the Symposium. 

INSTRUCTIONS FOR AUTHORS: 
This year we are instituting mechanisms for "electronic" submission
of papers for the refereeing process. Final papers will still be
submitted in hard copy. 

We will continue to accept papers submitted via various forms of mail,
but not fax.  Papers should include an abstract, must not exceed 7500
words, and must report original work that has not been published
previously and is not under consideration for publication
elsewhere. The names and affiliations of authors should appear on a
separate cover page only, as "blind" refereeing is used. Authors must
certify prior to December 27, 1996 that all necessary clearances for
publication have been obtained. The committee strongly encourages
authors to include archival sources as references (books, journal
articles, etc.) and to include references to "WEB" or other "NET"
sources only if they can be backed up by some archival source. In this
way, we can ensure that people who read the paper 5 years from now
will have access to the information used as background and
justification of the arguments presented.

Panel proposals should include a title, an abstract which describes
the topic(s) to be discussed, the names of all proposed participants
and assurances that the participants agree to serve on the panel, a
proposed length and format for the panel and any other information
that the panel proposer thinks would support their proposal. We will
publish the Panel Abstract in the Proceedings as well as any position
papers submitted by the panelists in support of the panel proposal.

Those submitting papers via "hard copy" should send six copies of
their paper or panel proposal to:

George W. Dinolt, Program Co-Chair 
Lockheed Martin Western Development Laboratories, 
Mail Stop X20, 
3200 Zanker Road, 
San Jose, CA 95134. 

Please mark the envelope "IEEE Security and Privacy Symposium." 

The title, abstract and authors names should be on a separate cover
page so that we can support the "blind refereeing process." We would
also like to have an electronic, ascii text version of the abstract
sent seperately to secprv97@wdl.lmco.com. The electronic version of
the abstract should include the title and the abstract as it appears
in the paper.

Authors who wish to submit an electronic version of a paper or panel proposal 
for evaluation should follow the instructions that will be posted
on our "Web" site at 

<a href=http://www.itd.nrl.navy.mil/ITD/5540/ieee>
http://www.itd.nrl.navy.mil/ITD/5540/ieee</a>

or by sending mail to secprv97@wdl.lmco.com with the word
"Instructions" in the Subject line. Instructions will be included in
the reply.  Papers and panel proposals must be received (however sent)
by 6:00 P.M. (PST) on Monday Dec 2, 1996 (The deadline has been
extended from the original call). Authors will be notified by
mid-January about the status of their papers.

Authors who submit an abstract for a 5-minute talk should include a
title, all authors names and their affiliations, where appropriate,
and text. The whole should fit easily on one 8.5" by 11" page.
Abstracts for 5-minute talks should be sent to George W. Dinolt at the
above address U.S. Postal address to be received no later than Friday,
April 19, 1997 at 6:00 P.M local time. We will review abstracts and
accept as many as we can. Please mark the envelope

Terry Vickers Benzel's panel on OMG's CORBA security standard will feature:
<ul>
<li> Richard Soley, Vice President of OMG and OMG Technical Committee
   Chair.  Richard is one of the key architects of the Object Request
   Broker Architecture.
<li> Bob Blakely, Jr., of IBM, who is one of the principal authors of the
   CORBA Security Specification.
<li> Bret Hartman, one of the principal authors of Appendix E of the
   Security Specification on Guidelines for a Trustworthy System.
<li> Roger Schell, of Novell, one of the founding fathers of the field
   of computer security
</ul>
<p>
Richard Soley will give an overview of CORBA and why we should be
interested in it; then Bob Blakely will describe the security spec and
the process of developing it. Bret Hartman will raise particular
security issues (e.g., can an ORB by non-bypassable?), and Roger Schell
will provide a commentary on the issues raised by the panel.
Terry Benzel leads a project that is looking into the use of CORBA
in conjunction with domain type enforcement to provide interoperability
between trusted and untrusted components in a client-server environment;
the project is developing object-oriented DTE mechanisms and several
prototype ORB servers.
<p>
Deborah Cooper will chair the discussion of Ross Anderson's paper on
Security for Medical Information Systems.  Discussants will be
<ul>
<li> Tom Rindfleisch, Director of Stanford's Center for Advanced Medical
  Informatics
<li> Bruce Sams, M.D., who has served as executive director of Permanente
  in Oakland and is a member of the National Institute of Medicine;
<li> Don Biggar, Vice President and Deputy General Manager, Health
  Management, Unisys
</ul>
<p>
As previously announced, Cynthia Irvine's panel on Goals for Computer
Security Education will feature Leslie Chalmers, Karl Levitt, Steve
Barnett, Jim Schindler and Roger Schell. Cynthia is expecting
diverse opinions from both the panelists and the audience. She says,
"Those of us engaged in research and development as well as education
need to be alert to the concerns and frustrations of the community we
serve.  Our "customers" need to understand that issues of security
and privacy need not be relegated to trivial afterthought nor
regarded as too difficult to address.  Both of these approaches
can result in inadequate resources to tackle real, but solvable
security problems.   Well-founded education programs can increase
confidence that the problems are, or can be, understood and that
we can make progress toward solving them."
<p>
Finally, Vipin Swarup of MITRE is organizing an evening discussion on
Java and Mobile Code Systems as a prelude to the paper "Java Security: From
HotJava to Netscape and Beyond," by Drew Dean, Edward Felten, and
Dan S. Wallach of Princeton University that has already attracted
considerable Internet discussion.  Representation from Sun is expected.

Paradigm shifts disrupt the status quo, destroy outdated ideas, and open the way to new possibilities.  This workshop explores radical new models for computer security, such as strategies for securing very large networks, providing software safety in large systems, and developing ethics in international cyberspace.  The goal is to develop transcendent solutions that provide the flexibility and interoperability users require in trusted systems. 
<p>
We offer a creative and constructive workshop environment for about 25 
participants at the beautiful UCLA Conference Center on lake Arrowhead in the 
San Bernardino Mountains, California.  Dress is casual.  The tone is exploratory rather than critical.  The refereed papers will be printed in a workshop proceedings. To participate, submit either a research paper or a 5-10 page position paper, preferably via email, to Program Chairs Catherine Meadows and David Bailey at the email addresses listed below by April 1, 1996.  Alternately, submit five copies of a hard-copy paper to either program chair by March 24, 1996.  The Program Committee will referee the papers and notify authors of acceptance status by June 9, 1996.

Computer systems are used to perform many critical tasks, including guiding
aircraft, scheduling railroads, assisting in surgery, controlling nuclear
reactors, performing financial transactions, military command and control,
and a host of other applications. Properties that such a system must have can
include availability, reliability, safety, and security. Although the study
of these properties evolved as separate disciplines, they have in common the
fact that a user must have a high degree of confidence in the service that the 
system delivers. The notion of dependability captures these concerns within
a single conceptual framework, making it possible to approach the different
requirements of a critical system in a unified way.
<p>
The sixth IFIP Working Conference on Dependable Computing for Critical
Applications aims at bringing together researchers and developers from
academia, industry, and government who are advancing the state-of-the-art
in dependable computing. Papers are sought in all areas of dependable
computing, including but not limited to models, methods, algorithms, tools
and practical experience with specifying, designing, implementing, assessing,
validating, operating, and maintaining dependable computing systems. Papers
that deal with man-machine interface issues (as they relate to dependability)
are specifically encouraged. Of particular but not exclusive interest will be
presentations that address combinations of dependability attributes, e.g.,
safety and security, through studies of either a theoretical or an
applied nature.
<p>
Garmisch-Partenkirchen lies at the foot of Germany's highest mountain, the
Zugspitze. The Olympic town is a winter sports capital and favored destination
for excursions and trips in Upper Bavaria.

The subject of the workshop is model-based automatic analysis and its role
in the design and development of software. By 'model-based', we mean first,
that an abstract model is analyzed in place of the software artifact
itself, and second, that automatic analyses based on semantic models-such
as model checking or state exploration-are used rather than syntax-driven
proof techniques.
<p>
Model-based analysis has been vigorously pursued in the context of
verification of finite-state systems such as computer hardware and
communications protocols; typical problems have ranged from the very
specialized (deadlock detection) to the very general (temporal-logic model
checking, semantic minimization). The developing commercial success of this
area has begun to spur interest among software researchers, especially in
light of the technical similarity between some verification algorithms and
static analysis approaches used in compilers, and the growing awareness of
the utility of precise software design notations.
<p>
Topics of interest will include but not be limited to:
<ul>
<font color="#FFFFFF">
<li>analysis algorithms and tools
<li>modeling notations and methods
<li>extraction of models from artifacts
<li>construction of artifacts from abstract models
<li>techniques for decomposition and abstraction of models
</ul>
<p>
<font color="#C0C0C0">
Research papers, experience reports, and position papers will all be welcome.
<p>
Submissions should not exceed 5,000 words, excluding bibliography and
figures, and must describe work that has not previously been published.
Papers deviating from these guidelines are likely to be returned without
review.  Authors should send to Rance Cleaveland by October 1, 1996:
<p>
<ul>
<font color="#FFFFFF">
<li>an email message containing the title, author's contact information
    and an abstract (not to exceed 200 words) in ASCII;
<li>the paper itself, which may be sent either as a poscript file by
    email, or by post; if by post,  please include five (5) hard copies.
</ul>
<p>
<font color="#C0C0C0">
Electronic submission is strongly encouraged; authors who do so should
ensure that their files use only standard, platform-independent postscript.

The purpose of COMPASS is to bring together researchers, developers,
integrators, and evaluators interested in problems related to
specifying, building, and certifying high-assurance systems. What
distinguishes COMPASS from similar conferences is its emphasis on
bridging the gap between theory and practice.  The theme of COMPASS
'97, "are we making any progress toward computer assurance?", will
focus discussion on whether the approaches that have been developed
and reported on during the past 25 years have any hope for solving
today's assurance problems.  In addition to exposing technical
weaknesses in the state-of-the-art and state-of-the-practice,
conference goals include: identifying barriers to applying existing
assurance technologies in industry, understanding the properties new
technologies must have to meet industrial needs, and identifying
evidence where advanced technologies are effective in attacking the
key problem areas of safety, security, fault-tolerance, and real-time.
<p>
For researchers, COMPASS '97 provides an opportunity to present new
theories, techniques, methods, or results of case studies to other
researchers and to practitioners who can put them to use. COMPASS '97
also provides a unique opportunity to learn from practitioners about
issues and problems encountered in constructing practical systems.
Practitioners have the opportunity to present results and lessons
learned to researchers as well as to learn of new research targeted to
problems in high-assurance systems. For practitioners, COMPASS
provides the unique opportunity to influence future research
directions.
<p>
The conference will be held June 16-20, 1997, at the National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg, Maryland, a suburb of
Washington, D.C.  The proceedings will be published by the IEEE Computer
Society.
<p>
Papers should present advances in the theory, design, implementation,
evaluation, or application of high-assurance systems, or report on
experiments, case studies, evaluations, and problems in the
application of computer assurance technology. Special consideration
will be given to presentations that directly address
the conference theme.  Proposals for panels are also sought,
particularly panels that directly address the conference theme.
<p>
There will be a tools fair, and the conference will be preceded by one or
two days of tutorials. Papers, panel proposals, tutorial proposals, and
tools fair proposals are solicited in relevant areas including:
<p>
<ul>
<font color="#000000">

prior arrangement with a program co-chair.  Send six
hard copies (printed on both sides if possible) of the paper, including
author names, affiliations, addresses, etc., and including the previously
submitted abstract.  Paper length is limited to 7,500 words.  For papers
with multiple authors, clearly indicate the author who will serve as
contact.
<p>
Only full original papers, which have not previously appeared and are not
submitted to any other conference or publication, will be
considered.  Authors are responsible for obtaining,
prior to acceptance, all necessary permissions and clearances for
publication and are expected to present their papers in person if 
accepted. Authors will be notified of acceptance by February 17, 1997. 
Camera-ready copies will be due March 15, 1997.
<p>
Papers that describe the use of technology presented at a previous COMPASS
conference (excluding previous work of the same author) are eligible for a 
special award.

The Symposium on Security and Privacy has, for 16 years, been the
premier forum for the presentation of developments in computer
security and for bringing together researchers and practitioners in the
field.  We seek to build on this tradition of excellence by
re-emphasizing work on engineering and applications while maintaining
our interest in theoretical advances. 
<p>
We continue to seek to broaden the scope of the Symposium.  We want to
hear not only about new theoretical results, but also about the design
and implementation of secure systems in specific application areas and
about policies relating to system security.  We are particularly
interested in papers on policy and technical issues relating to privacy
in the context of the information infrastructure, papers that relate
software and system engineering technology to the design of secure
systems and papers on hardware and architectural support for secure
systems. Papers or Panels which discuss the application of theory to
practice which describe not only the successes but the failures and
the lessons learned are of special interest.
<p>
Topics on which papers and panel sessions proposals are invited
include, but are not limited to, the following:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Commercial and Industrial Security,
<li>Security and other Critical System Properties,
Secure Systems,
<li>Distributed Systems,
<li>Network Security,
<li>Database Security,
<li>Data Integrity,
<li>Access Controls,
<li>Information Flow ,
<li>Security Verification,
<li>Viruses and Worms,
<li>Security Protocols,
<li>Authentication,
<li>Biometrics,
<li>Smartcards,
<li>Auditing,
<li>Intrusion Detection,
<li>Privacy Issues,
<li>Policy Modeling
</ul>
<p>
A continuing feature of the symposium will be a session of 5-minute
talks. We want to hear from people who are advancing the field in the
areas of system design and implementation, but may lack the resources
needed to prepare a full paper. Abstracts of these talks will be
distributed at the Symposium.

<font size=4><font color="#8C1717"><b>INSTRUCTIONS FOR AUTHORS:</b> 
<p>
<font size=3>
<font color="#000000">
This year we are instituting mechanisms for "electronic" submission
of papers for the refereeing process. Final papers will still be
submitted in hard copy. 
<p>
We will continue to accept papers submitted via various forms of mail,
but not fax.  Papers should include an abstract, must not exceed 7500
words, and must report original work that has not been published
previously and is not under consideration for publication
elsewhere. The names and affiliations of authors should appear on a
separate cover page only, as "blind" refereeing is used. Authors must
certify prior to <b>December 27, 1996</b> that all necessary clearances for
publication have been obtained. The committee strongly encourages
authors to include archival sources as references (books, journal
articles, etc.) and to include references to "WEB" or other "NET"
sources only if they can be backed up by some archival source. In this
way, we can ensure that people who read the paper 5 years from now
will have access to the information used as background and
justification of the arguments presented.
<p>
Panel proposals should include a title, an abstract which describes
the topic(s) to be discussed, the names of all proposed participants
and assurances that the participants agree to serve on the panel, a
proposed length and format for the panel and any other information
that the panel proposer thinks would support their proposal. We will
publish the Panel Abstract in the Proceedings as well as any position
papers submitted by the panelists in support of the panel proposal.
<p>
Those submitting papers via "hard copy" should send six copies of
their paper or panel proposal to:
<p>

<A NAME="summary"><H2>Summary:</H2>

The use of a switched communications network should not require
revealing who is talking to whom.  Onion Routing is a flexible
communications infrastructure that is resistant to both eavesdropping
and traffic analysis.  Onion routing accomplishes this goal by
separating identification from routing.  Connections are always
anonymous, although communication need not be.  Communication may be
made anonymous by removing identifying information from the data
stream.  Onion routing can be used by a variety of unmodified Internet
applications by means of proxies.

<P>

Traffic analysis can be used to infer who is talking to whom over a
public network.  For example, in a packet switched network, packets
have a header used for routing, and a payload that carries the data.
The header, which much be visible to the network (and to observers of
the network), reveals the source and destination of the packet.  Even
if the header were obscured in some way, the packet could still be
tracked as it moves through the network.  Encrypting the payload is
similarly ineffective, because the goal of traffic analysis is to
identify who is talking to whom and not (to identify directly) the
content of that conversation.

<P>

The efficiencies of the public Internet are strong motivation for
companies to use it instead of private intranets.  However, these
companies may want to protect their interests.  For example, a
researcher using the World Wide Web (Web) may expect his particular
focus to remain private, and the existence of inter-company
collaboration may be confidential.  Individuals may wish to protect
their privacy too.  The identities of the participants in an e-mail
conversation should be known only to the communicating parties.  A
person shopping on the Web may not want his visits tracked.
Certainly, someone spending anonymous e-cash expects that the source
of the e-cash be untraceable.

<P>

Onion routing has been prototyped on Sun Solaris 2.4.  The prototype
includes proxies for private Web browsing, remote login, e-mail, and
file transfer protocols, and also anonymizing versions of those
proxies that remove identifying information from the data stream.
This page describes the Onion Routing system at several levels of
abstraction, including a detailed specification for reimplementors.

<P>

Our motivation here is not specifically to provide anonymous
communication, but, to seperate identification from routing.
Applications and users may identify themselves to each other.  But the
use of a public network should not automatically reveal to others the
identities of communicating parties.

<A NAME="introduction"><H2>Introduction:</H2>
Letters sent through the Post Office are usually in an envelope marked
with the sender's and recipient's addresses.  We trust that the Post
Office does not peek inside the envelope, because we consider its
contents private.  We also trust that the Post Office does not monitor
who sends mail to whom, because that information is also considered
private.
<P>
These two types of sensitive information, the contents of an envelope
and its address, apply equally well to electronic communication over
the Internet.  Just like mail, electronic messages travel in
electronic envelopes, and protecting the privacy of these messages
requires both safeguarding the contents of those envelopes and hiding
the addresses on the envelopes. Although communicating parties usually
identify themselves to one another, there is no reason that the use of
a public network like the Internet ought to reveal to others who is
talking to whom and what they are talking about.  The first concern is
traffic analysis, the latter is eavesdropping.
<P>
By making both eavesdropping and traffic analysis hard, the privacy of
communication is protected.  But what about anonymity?  Can two
parties communicate, if one or both do not want to be identified to
the other?  If the electronic envelope keeps its contents private, and
the address on the envelope is also hidden, then any identifying
information can only be inside the envelope!  So for anonymous
communication, we remove identifying information from the contents of
an envelope.  This may be called anonymizing a private envelope.
<P>
These goals may appear to be insolvable: Can the contents of an
envelope really be kept private?  How can a letter reach its
destination if its address is hidden?  Can two parties communicate
without revealing their identities to one another?  Can all this be
done without trusting third parties (the Post Office, for example) not
to remember addresses or to open envelopes?
<P>
Onion Routing uses well known networking and cryptographic techniques
to protect both the privacy and anonymity of Internet communication
against both eavesdropping and traffic analysis.  Onion Routing is
easily used in a wide variety of Internet applications (WWW browsing
and electronic mail, for example) to communicate both privately and
and anonymously.

<A NAME="solution"><H2>Solution:</H2>
If we protect a communications channel against both eavesdropping and
traffic analysis, and remove identifying information from the data
stream, then we have anonymous and private communication.
<P>
Onion Routing provides socket connections that are strongly resistant
to both eavesdropping and traffic analysis.  The privacy of these
socket connections is moved beneath the application layer and made
application independent.  Unmodified Internet applications may use
these anonymous socket connections by means of proxies.  If the proxies
anonymize the data stream, anonymity may be layered on top of anonymous
socket connections.  Onion Routing has been implemented on Sun Solaris
2.4 along with proxies for HTTP (WWW) and RLOGIN.  Proxies for e-mail
(SMTP) and FTP are forthcoming.
<P>
Onion Routing works in the following way: An application, instead of
making a (socket) connection directly to a destination machine, makes
a socket connection to an Onion Routing Proxy.  That Onion Routing
Proxy builds an anonymous connection through several other Onion Routers
to the destination.  Each Onion Router can only identify adjacent
Onion Routers along the route.  Before sending data over an anonymous
connection, the first onion router adds a layer of encryption for each
onion router in the route.  As data moves through the anonymous
connection, each onion router removes one layer of encryption, so it
finally arrives as plaintext.  This layering occurs in the reverse
order for data moving back to the initiator.  Data passed along the
anonymous connection appears different at each Onion Router, so data
cannot be tracked en route and compromised Onion Routers cannot
cooperate.  When the connection is broken, all information about the
connection is cleared at each Onion Router
<P>
Onion Routing differs from other anonymity services in two ways:
Communication is real-time and bidirectional; and the anonymous
connections are application independent.  Applications may choose
whether to identify their users over an anonymous connection.  However,
the use of a switched public network should not automatically
reveal who is talking to whom.  This is the traffic analysis that
Onion Routing complicates.

<H2>Recent Accomplishments</H2>
<p>

We have developed techniques for computing the capacity of
timing channels [1] and our application of these techniques to the
SINTRA database architecture [2].   We developed capacity bounds [1]
that are useful, for example, in bounding the capacity of
covert channels  arising from the need for atomicity in certain
database schedulers.  <P>

We have developed the theoretical basis of the  Pump [2] which is a dynamic,
quasi-secure, buffer
that accommodates the need for acknowledgements in communicating
computer systems.  A major benefit of the Pump is that it has minimal
negative impact upon communication throughput.  We have also extended the Pump 
to deal with a network environment [3].  We have also developed a new model 
for bursty computer communication [4] that further shows the advantages of the
Pump.
<p>
We have developed  a general theory of composition for Noninterference-like
security properties [5].  Unlike previous work, which addresses only the
question of whether a property is preserved when composed via general
hook-up with itself, we address the more general question of what
properties will be satisfied by a system in which components satisfying
different properties are composed via various types of composition
constructs.
<P>
We will study current techniques developed in steganography 
for visual information hiding and detection. 
Primarily, we are interested in the mathematical analysis of continuous
capacity calculation. We will also investigate further refinements 
 of the formal foundations of steganography.

<TITLE>NEW SECURITY PARADIGMS '96</TITLE>
<hr>
<p>
<b>PRELIMINARY CALL FOR PAPERS
<p>
<p>NEW SECURITY PARADIGMS '96
</b><p>

<p>A workshop sponsored by ACM SIGSAC, the Department of Defense, and the
Aerospace Institute
<p>

<b><p>UCLA Conference Center
<p>Lake Arrowhead, CA
<p>
<p>September 16-19, 1996
</b><p>
<hr>
<p>
Paradigm shifts disrupt the status quo, destroy outdated ideas, and open the way to new possibilities.  This workshop explores radical new models for computer security, such as strategies for securing very large networks, providing software safety in large systems, and developing ethics in international cyberspace.  The goal is to develop transcendent solutions that provide the flexibility and interoperability users require in trusted systems. 
<p>
We offer a creative and constructive workshop environment for about 25 
participants at the beautiful UCLA Conference Center on lake Arrowhead in the 
San Bernardino Mountains, California.  Dress is casual.  The tone is exploratory rather than critical.  The refereed papers will be printed in a workshop proceedings. To participate, submit either a research paper or a 5-10 page position paper, preferably via email, to Program Chairs Catherine Meadows and David Bailey at the email addresses listed below by April 1, 1996.  Alternately, submit five copies of a hard-copy paper to either program chair by March 24, 1996.  The Program Committee will referee the papers and notify authors of acceptance status by June 9, 1996.
<p>
Scholarships are available.  
<p>

<p>
<b>Sixth IFIP International Working Conference on<br>
Dependable Computing for Critical Applications<br>
<p>
<i>Can We Rely on Computers?</i><br>
<p>
 March 5-7, 1997<br>
Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany<br></b>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<b>Organized by</b>:<br>
<ul>
<li>IFIP Working Group 10.4 on Dependable Computing and Fault Tolerance
</ul>
<b>In cooperation with</b>:<br>
<ul>
<li>IFIP Technical Committee 11 on Security and Protection in Information Processing Systems
<li>IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Fault-Tolerant Computing 
<li>EWICS Technical Committee 7 on Systems Reliability, Safety and Security
</ul>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
Computer systems are used to perform many critical tasks, including guiding
aircraft, scheduling railroads, assisting in surgery, controlling nuclear
reactors, performing financial transactions, military command and control,
and a host of other applications. Properties that such a system must have can
include availability, reliability, safety, and security. Although the study
of these properties evolved as separate disciplines, they have in common the
fact that a user must have a high degree of confidence in the service that the 
system delivers. The notion of dependability captures these concerns within
a single conceptual framework, making it possible to approach the different
requirements of a critical system in a unified way.
<p>
The sixth IFIP Working Conference on Dependable Computing for Critical
Applications aims at bringing together researchers and developers from
academia, industry, and government who are advancing the state-of-the-art
in dependable computing. Papers are sought in all areas of dependable
computing, including but not limited to models, methods, algorithms, tools
and practical experience with specifying, designing, implementing, assessing,
validating, operating, and maintaining dependable computing systems. Papers
that deal with man-machine interface issues (as they relate to dependability)
are specifically encouraged. Of particular but not exclusive interest will be
presentations that address combinations of dependability attributes, e.g.,
safety and security, through studies of either a theoretical or an
applied nature.
<p>
Garmisch-Partenkirchen lies at the foot of Germany's highest mountain, the
Zugspitze. The Olympic town is a winter sports capital and favored destination
for excursions and trips in Upper Bavaria.

<title>Call for Papers:  First ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on Automated Analysis of Software</title>
</head>
<body>  
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>First ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on<br>
Automated Analysis of Software</h2>
<h3>affiliated with POPL '97
Paris, France  /  14 January 1997</h3>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
The subject of the workshop is model-based automatic analysis and its role
in the design and development of software. By 'model-based', we mean first,
that an abstract model is analyzed in place of the software artifact
itself, and second, that automatic analyses based on semantic models-such
as model checking or state exploration-are used rather than syntax-driven
proof techniques.
<p>
Model-based analysis has been vigorously pursued in the context of
verification of finite-state systems such as computer hardware and
communications protocols; typical problems have ranged from the very
specialized (deadlock detection) to the very general (temporal-logic model
checking, semantic minimization). The developing commercial success of this
area has begun to spur interest among software researchers, especially in
light of the technical similarity between some verification algorithms and
static analysis approaches used in compilers, and the growing awareness of
the utility of precise software design notations.
<p>
Topics of interest will include but not be limited to:
<ul>
<li>analysis algorithms and tools
<li>modeling notations and methods
<li>extraction of models from artifacts
<li>construction of artifacts from abstract models
<li>techniques for decomposition and abstraction of models
</ul>
<p>
Research papers, experience reports, and position papers will all be welcome.
<p>
Submissions should not exceed 5,000 words, excluding bibliography and
figures, and must describe work that has not previously been published.
Papers deviating from these guidelines are likely to be returned without
review.  Authors should send to Rance Cleaveland by October 1, 1996:
<p>
<ul>
<li>an email message containing the title, author's contact information
    and an abstract (not to exceed 200 words) in ASCII;
<li>the paper itself, which may be sent either as a poscript file by
    email, or by post; if by post,  please include five (5) hard copies.
</ul>
<p>
Electronic submission is strongly encouraged; authors who do so should
ensure that their files use only standard, platform-independent postscript.

<title>Call for Papers:  COMPASS '97</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<h1>COMPASS '97<br>
12th Annual Conference on Computer Assurance</h1>
<p>
<h2>June 16-20, 1997<br>
Gaithersburg,  MD</h2>
<p>
<b>WEB SITE:<br>
<a href="http://hissa.ncsl.nist.gov/compass/">http://hissa.ncsl.nist.gov/compass/</a>
<p>
Sponsored by:<br>
IEEE Aerospace & Electronic Society<br>
IEEE National Capital Area</b>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
The purpose of COMPASS is to bring together researchers, developers,
integrators, and evaluators interested in problems related to
specifying, building, and certifying high-assurance systems. What
distinguishes COMPASS from similar conferences is its emphasis on
bridging the gap between theory and practice.  The theme of COMPASS
'97, "are we making any progress toward computer assurance?", will
focus discussion on whether the approaches that have been developed
and reported on during the past 25 years have any hope for solving
today's assurance problems.  In addition to exposing technical
weaknesses in the state-of-the-art and state-of-the-practice,
conference goals include: identifying barriers to applying existing
assurance technologies in industry, understanding the properties new
technologies must have to meet industrial needs, and identifying
evidence where advanced technologies are effective in attacking the
key problem areas of safety, security, fault-tolerance, and real-time.
<p>
For researchers, COMPASS '97 provides an opportunity to present new
theories, techniques, methods, or results of case studies to other
researchers and to practitioners who can put them to use. COMPASS '97
also provides a unique opportunity to learn from practitioners about
issues and problems encountered in constructing practical systems.
Practitioners have the opportunity to present results and lessons
learned to researchers as well as to learn of new research targeted to
problems in high-assurance systems. For practitioners, COMPASS
provides the unique opportunity to influence future research
directions.
<p>
The conference will be held June 16-20, 1997, at the National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg, Maryland, a suburb of
Washington, D.C.  The proceedings will be published by the IEEE Computer
Society.
<p>
Papers should present advances in the theory, design, implementation,
evaluation, or application of high-assurance systems, or report on
experiments, case studies, evaluations, and problems in the
application of computer assurance technology. Special consideration
will be given to presentations that directly address
the conference theme.  Proposals for panels are also sought,
particularly panels that directly address the conference theme.
<p>
There will be a tools fair, and the conference will be preceded by one or
two days of tutorials. Papers, panel proposals, tutorial proposals, and
tools fair proposals are solicited in relevant areas including:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Software Reliability              
<li>Software Safety
<li>Computer Security                
<li>Formal Methods
<li>Tools Support                     
<li>Human-Computer Interaction
<li>Real-Time Systems                 
<li>Embedded Systems              
<li>V & V Practices
<li>Certification
<li>Standards
<li>Measurement and Metrics
<li>Life-Cycle Processes

<TITLE>First CORBA Security Workshop</TITLE>
</head>
<body>  
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<b>CALL FOR PARTICIPATION
<p>  
FIRST WORKSHOP ON<br>
BUILDING AND USING CORBASEC ORBS<br>
<p>
April 1-3, 1997<br>
Baltimore, Maryland, USA
</b>
<p>
Co-Sponsored by the <a href="http://ruby.omg.org/home.htm">Object Management Group</a>
 and the <a href="http://www.nsa.gov:8080/">National Security Agency</a>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>:
<p>
The Object Management Group (OMG) CORBA specification includes security
protocols and services that are being widely adopted.  Unfortunately, a
full understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the security
aspects of the CORBA standards requires experience with Object Oriented
Technology, Information Technology Security and operational system
planning, development and deployment. OMG is hosting this workshop to
bring together individuals with varying sets of these types of
experience to examine, explain and critique the adopted OMG security
specifications and other similar and related work.
<p>
The workshop approach will be to have individuals with the full range
of OOT, IT Security, and Operational System experience examine and
discuss, in turn, the content and meaning of the CORBA Security
standards, the design issues relevant to realizing the CORBA Security
standards in ORBs, and the design issues relevant to using ORBs meeting
the CORBA Security standards as the foundation for operational systems.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<b>INSTRUCTIONS</b>:
<p>
The workshop is open to all with an interest in and understanding of
one or more of the CORBA Security standards or experience backgrounds.
Participation will be limitted to approximately 50 individuals who are
able to clearly and concisely express their perspective in one or more
of the following major categories (with example subordinate issues):
<p>
<b>CORBA Security Standards</b>:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Concise representation of the CORBA Security standard's security
    model
<li>Concise representation of the CORBA Security standard's object
    model
<li>Relationship of the CORBA Security standards to traditional
    perspectives on IT Security 
<li>Relationship of the CORBA Security standards to traditional 
    perspectives on OOT design
</ul>
<p>
<b>Secure ORB Design Issues</b>:
<p>
<ul>
<li>How to implement CORBA Security standard mandatory (psuedo) objects
<li>The affect of the CORBA Security standard requirements on the rest
    of the CORBA specifications' requirements
<li>Security assurance issues in ORBs
<li>Security Architecture issues in ORBs
<li>ORB Security dependencies on OS security
<li>ORB Security dependencies on network security
</ul>
<p>
<b>Secure ORB Usage Issues</b>:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Capabilities provided by the CORBASec 1.1 standard objects
<li>Capabilities not provided by the CORBASec 1.1 standard objects
<li>Extending basic CORBASec 1.1 standard objects
<li>Administering security in Secure ORBs
</ul>
<p>
Interested individuals or organizations are invited to submit a brief position
statement of one printed page (or 60 80-character email lines of text)
outlining a position on one or more of the three major categories by <b>20

"Applications of Private Socket Connections," submitted for
publication, (with M. G. Reed and P. F. Syverson).
<p>

<blockquote> 
Onion Routing provides a new primitive, private socket connections.
These private connections are strongly resistant to both eavesdropping
and traffic analysis.  By removing identifying information from the
data stream, these connections may be made anonymous.  A prototype of
onion routing is in the public domain.  This paper describes
applications of onion routing: onion routing proxies for RLOGIN, HTTP,
SMTP, and FTP; private connections that hide location information for
cellular phone and location tracking systems; and other Internet
applications.

"Private Socket Connections," submitted for publication, (with M. G. Reed and P. F. Syverson).
<p>

<blockquote>
Onion Routing provides private socket connections that are strongly resistant to both eavesdropping and traffic analysis.  The privacy of these socket connections is moved beneath the application layer and made application independent.  Unmodified Internet applications may use these private socket connections by means of proxies.  If the proxies anonymize the data stream, anonymity may be layered on top of private socket connections.  Onion Routing has been implemented on Sun Solaris 2.4 with proxies for HTTP (WWW) and RLOGIN.  Proxies for e-mail (SMTP) and FTP are forthcoming.  This paper describes the Onion Routing system at several levels of abstraction, including a specification for re-implementors.

Proxies for Anonymous Routing, to appear in the Proceedings of the 12th Annual Computer Security Applications Conference, Dec., 1996, (with M. G. Reed and P. F. Syverson). <a href="acsac96.ps"> PostScript</a>
<p>

<blockquote>

Using traffic analysis, it is possible to infer who is talking to whom
over a public network.  This paper describes a flexible communications
infrastructure, Onion Routing, which is resistant to traffic
analysis.  Onion routing lives just beneath the applications layer,
and is designed to interface with a wide variety of unmodified
Internet services by means of proxies.  Onion routing has been
implemented on Sun Solaris 2.4; in addition proxies for World Wide Web
browsing (HTTP), remote logins (RLOGIN), e-mail (SMTP), and file
transfers (FTP) have been implemented.

Onion routing provides applications independent, real-time, and
bi-directional anonymous connections that are resistant to both
eavesdropping and traffic analysis.  Applications making use of onion
routing's anonymous connections may (and usually should) identify
their users over the anonymous connection.  User anonymity may be
layered on top of the anonymous connections by removing identifying
information from the data stream.  Our goal here is anonymous
connections, not anonymous communication.  The use of a packet
switched public network should not automatically reveal who is talking
to whom.  This is the traffic analysis that onion routing complicates.

"Towards a Model of Storage Jamming," Proceedings of the 9th IEEE
Computer Security Foundations Workshop, pages 176-185, Kenmare,
Ireland, June 1996, (with J. McDermott). <a href="csfw96.ps">PostScript</a>
<p>

<blockquote>
Storage jamming can degrade real-world activities that share stored 
data. Storage jamming is not prevented by access controls or cryptographic 
techniques. Verification to rule out storage jamming logic is impractical 
for shrink-wrapped software or low-cost custom applications. Detection 
mechanisms do offer more promise. In this paper, we model storage jamming 
and a detection mechanism, using Unity logic. We find that Unity logic, in 
conjunction with some high-level operators, models storage jamming in a 
natural way and allows us to reason about susceptibility, rate of jamming, 
and impact on persistent values.

"Hiding Routing Information," Workshop on Information Hiding, Cambridge, UK, May 1996, (with M. Reed and P. Syverson). <a href="newton96.ps"> PostScript</a>
<p>

<blockquote>
This paper describes an architecture, Onion Routing, that limits a network's vulnerability to traffic analysis.  The architecture provides anonymous socket connections by means of proxy servers.  It provides real-time, bi-directional, anonymous communication for any protocol that can be adapted to use a proxy service.  Specifically, the architecture provides for bi-directional communication even though no-one but the initiator's proxy server knows anything but previous and next hops in the communication chain.  This implies that neither the respondent nor his proxy server nor any external observer need know the identity of the initiator or his proxy server.  A prototype of Onion Routing has been implemented.  This prototype works with HTTP (World Wide Web) proxies.  In addition, an analogous proxy for TELNET has been implemented.  Proxies for FTP and SMTP are under development.

<p>

<blockquote>
Automobiles have proven to be a wonderful invention; people all over
the world depend on them.  However, cars used improperly can cause
injuries - especially those that serve as hiding places for bombs.  It
is hard to imagine a software agent that could cause physical harm to
anyone - it is only software, after all.  What if that software
controls an electrical appliance, such as a coffee maker?  Could a
control failure cause the coffee maker to overheat and start a fire?

"Several Secure Store and Forward Devices," Proceedings of the Third ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, New Delhi, India, pages 129-137, March 1996.  <a href="cccs96.ps"> PostScript</a>
<p>

<blockquote>
DoD system high enclaves are often isolated from systems at other security levels because the usual connectors (guards) are expensive to procure, integrate, accredit, and operate, and usually require a human in the middle to review the data flow, independent of direction.  This isolation reduces the effectiveness of information systems.  The secure store and forward devices described in this paper can be used to solve an important (yet tractable) half of the problem: moving data from LOW to HIGH without a human in the middle.  These devices were expressly designed to be easy to accredit.  Security critical function is both minimized and separated from non-security critical function to reduce the need for trusted components.  A prototype implementation of one of these store and forward devices is described as well.

"Improving Inter-Enclave Information Flow for a Secure Strike Planning Application," Proceedings of the 11th Annual Computer Security Applications Conference, New Orleans, Louisiana, December 1995, (with J. N. Froscher, M. H. Kang, C. E. Landwehr, A. Moore, I. S. Moskowitz, C. N. Payne). <a href="acsac95.ps"> PostScript</a>
<p>

<blockquote>
DoD operates many system high enclaves with limited information flow between enclaves at different security levels.  Too often, the result is duplication of operations and inconsistent and untimely data at different sites, which reduces the effectiveness of DoD decision support systems.  This paper describes our solution to this problem as it arises in installations of the Joint Maritime Command Information System (JMCIS), an integrated C4I system.  Our approach views databases in more classified enclaves as potential replica sites for data from less classified enclaves.  Replicated data flows from lower enclaves to higher ones via one-way connections, yielding a high assurance MLS (multi-level secure) distributed system.  The one-way connections are the only trusted components.  This approach is based on our work on SINTRA (Secure Information Through Replicated Architecture), and applies generally to any collection of systems each running a database at system high.  It complements and exploits modern system design methods, which separate data management from data processing, and enables effective, low-cost MLS operation within that paradigm.  In addition to describing current JMCIS installations and our architectural approach, the paper presents our approach for justifying a system's security and our use of formal methods to increase assurance that security requirements are met.

"Storage Jamming," Database Security IX: Status and Prospects, Chapman
and Hall, London, 1995, (with John McDermott). <a href="ds95.ps">
PostScript</a>
<p>

<blockquote>
In the past, the most likely motive for attacks that modify data would have been financial gain.  However, changes in technology have made many organizations so dependent on information systems that it is now possible to disrupt or degrade their operations by interfering with their supporting information systems. When this disruption is accomplished by unauthorized modification of data we call it storage jamming.  Storage jamming is the malicious modification of stored data, done for the purpose of degrading or disrupting real-world operations that depend on the correctness of the data. We assume the person initiating the malicious modification (frequently via a Trojan horse) does not receive any direct benefit, financial or otherwise, but rather is motivated by more indirect goals such as improving the competitive position of his or her own organization. The main goal of this paper is to define storage jamming.  We also discuss our work to date on possible defenses against it; in order to make the case that there are solutions.  In the next section we discuss the nature of storage jamming including possible jamming strategies and vulnerability to jamming. The next two sections discuss a variety of anti-jamming techniques.  Some of these candidate techniques are based on previous work on security-oriented data integrity but are unsuitable for use against jamming attacks. We then discuss a particular kind of anti-jamming mechanism called a detection object. The paper ends with a summary and discussion of future work.

<blockquote>
This paper describes, by means of an example, how one may mechanically verify delay insensitive circuits on an automated theorem prover.  It presents the verification of both the safety and liveness properties of an n-node delay insensitive FIFO. The proof system used is a mechanized implementation of Unity on the Boyer-Moore prover.

<p>

<blockquote>
This paper presents a formal model of several fundamental concepts in VHDL including the semantics of individual concurrent statements, and groups of those statements, resolution functions, delta delays, and hierarchical component structuring.  Based on this model, several extensions to VHDL are proposed, including nondeterministic assignments and unbounded asynchrony.  Nondeterminism allows the specification of environments and of classes of devices.  This model naturally captures the meaning of composition of VHDL programs.

"Mechanically Verifying Concurrent Programs", Ph.D. thesis, the University of Texas at Austin, 1992. <a href="thesis92.ps"> PostScript</a>
<p>

<blockquote>
This thesis develops a sound, mechanically verified proof system suitable for the mechanical verification of both the safety and liveness properties of concurrent programs.  Mechanical verification increases the trustworthiness of a proof.  The properties proved may be (non-existentially quantified) first order, and the programs may be parameterized.  The proof system provides a mechanized framework for reasoning about concurrent programs under a variety of fairness assumptions.  It is demonstrated by the mechanically verified proofs of four concurrent programs.  This thesis presents several significant results, including the first extensive mechanized use of proof rules which are theorems of an operational semantics.  This research also prompted the development of both the functional variables and Defn-Sk extensions to the Boyer-Moore logic.  This thesis both contributes to the science of mechanized program verification and lays the groundwork for future research.

Current projects to provide MLS computing services rarely seem to

distribution, replication, and interoperation are currently receiving
much attention in the commercial database system sector but have yet to
be applied to the delivery of MLS computing services.  This paper
explains how these concepts might be applied to help deliver MLS
computing services relatively quickly and cheaply, and how they can
ease integration of legacy systems and new technology into future MLS

<blockquote>
An organized record of actual flaws can be useful to designers,
implementors, and evaluators of computer systems.  This paper provides
a taxonomy for computer program security flaws together with an
appendix that carefully documents 50 actual security flaws.  These
flaws have all been described previously in the open literature, but in
widely separated places.  For those new to the field of computer
security, they provide a good introduction to the characteristics of
security flaws and how they can arise.  Because these flaws were not
randomly selected from a valid statistical sample of such flaws, we
make no strong claims concerning the likely distribution of actual
security flaws within the taxonomy.   However, this method of organizing
security flaw data can help those who have custody of more
representative samples to organize them and to focus their efforts to
remove and, eventually, to prevent the introduction of security flaws.

<blockquote>
Accreditors want to know what vulnerabilities will exist if they decide
to turn on a system.  TCSEC evaluations address products, not systems.
Not only the hardware and software of a system are of concern;  the
accreditor needs to view the system components in relation to the
environment in which they operate and in relation to the system's
mission.  This paper proposes an informal but comprehensive approach
that can provide the accreditor with the necessary information.  First,
we discuss the identification of assumptions and assertions that
reflect system INFOSEC requirements.  Second, we propose the definition
of an assurance strategy to integrate security engineering and system
engineering.  The assurance strategy initially documents the set of
assumptions and assertions derived from the requirements  It is
elaborated and refined throughout the development, yielding the
assurance argument, delivered with the system, which provides the
primary technical basis for the certification decision. With the
assurance strategy in place, certification of the trusted system can
become an audit of the development process.

<blockquote>
Military systems that process classified information must operate in a
secure manner; i.e., they must adequately protect information against
unauthorized disclosure, modification, and withholding.  A goal of current
research in computer security is to facilitate the construction of
"multilevel secure systems," systems that protect information of different
classifications from users with different clearances.  Security models are
used to define the concept of security embodied by a computer system.  A
single model, called the Bell and LaPadula model, has dominated recent efforts
to build secure systems but has deficiencies.  We are developing a new
approach to defining security models based on the idea that a security model
should be derived from a specific application.  To evaluate our approach, we
have formulated a security model for a family of military message systems.
This paper introduces the message system application, describes the problems of
using the Bell-LaPadula model in real applications, and presents our security
model both informally and formally.  Significant aspects of the security 
model are its definition of multi-level objects and its inclusion of
application-dependent security assertions.  Prototypes based on this model
are being developed.

<p>
This book surveys the state-of-the-art techniques and the
state-of-practice approaches in formal methods for real-time
computing.  There is growing recognition of the crucial role of timing
in many computer systems, especially safety-critical systems.
Moreover, the benefits of increasing the level of formalism, especially
in the early stages of specification and design, has recently been
demonstrated in a number of industrial-strength applications.  This
issue of the John Wiley Series on Software Trends focuses on the
application of formal methods in the development of "hard" real-time
systems, that is, systems that are required to satisfy critical timing
requirements.
<p>
The book consists of 10 chapters.  The first chapter provides an
overview of  the leading specification languages, formal models, and
analysis techniques for developing real-time systems.  Each of the
following chapters is written by experts in a particular method.
Included are chapters on the Modechart language, the I/O Timed
Automaton model, the Duration Calculus, Timed LOTOS, a real-time
process algebra called the Algebra of Communicating Shared Resources,
Timed Petri Nets, the real-time logic TRIO, automata-theoretic
verification, symbolic model checking, and an end-to-end design
methodology for guaranteeing requirements of real-time systems.  The
book uses a tutorial style and gives readers intuition about promising
approaches and their practical impact through the use of examples.  It
is essential reading for students of formal methods and real-time
system development, project managers considering the use of formal
methods, and researchers interested in learning more about the major
new formalisms for specifying and verifying real-time systems.

<blockquote>
Past experience in system security certification indicates the need
for developers of high assurance systems to coherently integrate the
evidence that their system satisfies its critical requirements.  This
document describes a method based on literate programming techniques
to help developers present the evidence they gather in a manner that
facilitates the certification effort.  We demonstrate this method
through the implementation and verification of a small but
non-trivial, security-relevant example, an RS-232 character repeater.
By addressing many of the important issues in system design, we expect
that this example will provide a model for developing assurance
arguments for full-scale composite systems with corresponding gains in
the expediency of the system certification process.

<blockquote>
The assurance argument that a trusted system satisfies its information
security requirements must be convincing, because the argument
supports the accreditation decision to allow the computer to process
classified information in an operational environment.  Assurance is
achieved through understanding, but some evidence that supports the
assurance argument can be difficult to understand.  This paper
describes a novel application of a technique, called literate
programming, that significantly improves the readability of the
assurance argument while maintaining its consistency with formal
specifications that are input to specification and verification
systems.  We describe an application of this technique to a simple
example and discuss the lessons learned from this effort.

<blockquote>
Previous work at NRL demonstrated the benefits of a security modeling
approach for building high assurance systems for particular application
domains.  This paper introduces an application domain called "selective
bypass" that is prominent in certain network security solutions.  We
present a parameterized modeling framework for the domain and then
instantiate a confidentiality model for a particular application,
called the External COMSEC Adaptor (ECA), within the framework.  We
conclude with lessons we learned from modeling, implementing and
verifying the ECA.  Our experience supports the use of the 
application-based security modeling approach for high assurance systems.

   critical requirements model", NRL Report 9528, Naval Research
   Laboratory, Washington DC, Dec., 1992.

<blockquote>
The ECA is an embedded computing device that processes message
traffic for a network that must enforce end-to-end user message
confidentiality.  The ECA uses a commercial, off-the-shelf
cryptographic device to transform sensitive data from the Red Domain
of the network so that it can be transmitted over the untrusted
communications links of the Black Domain.  For transmission purposes,
certain parts of a message, namely the message header, must be
bypassed around the cryptographic device.  The primary critical
requirement for the ECA, "Restricted Red-to-Black Flow" (RRTBF),
requires that the bypassed portion of each message must satisfy
certain format restrictions, and that the rate of bypass must be
constrained.  In this report, we present an informal model of the
ECA's critical requirements together with the assumptions under which
the model was constructed.  We then formalize this model by using the
CSP Trace Model of computation.

Accreditors want to know what vulnerabilities will exist if they decide

Not only the hardware and software of a system are of concern;  the
accreditor needs to view the system components in relation to the
environment in which they operate and in relation to the system's
mission.  This paper proposes an informal but comprehensive approach
that can provide the accreditor with the necessary information.  First,
we discuss the identification of assumptions and assertions that
reflect system INFOSEC requirements.  Second, we propose the definition
of an assurance strategy to integrate security engineering and system
engineering.  The assurance strategy initially documents the set of
assumptions and assertions derived from the requirements  It is
elaborated and refined throughout the development, yielding the
assurance argument, delivered with the system, which provides the
primary technical basis for the certification decision. With the
assurance strategy in place, certification of the trusted system can
become an audit of the development process.

Unlike previous approaches to developing a trusted

control at a high level of assurance through replication of data and
operations.  We present a model of the SINTRA replicated architecture
trusted database system which shows how the logical (users') view of
the system and its security policy is translated into the physical
structure and operations of the SINTRA system.  We formalize the
intended security policy for replicated architecture and demonstrate
that a high level of assurance can be obtained solely from replication
with virtually no change to the sturcture of the underlying database
systems or the security kernel.

<blockquote>
Relational database systems are based on a powerful abstraction:  the
relational data model with the relational algebra and update
semantics.  If the database design (i. e., the way the data is
organized) satisfies criteria provided by this foundation, users have
assurance that they can retrieve information in a consistent,
predictable way.  Multilevel secure database systems must not only
provide assurance that information is protected based on its
sensitivity, but should be based on a data model as sound and complete
as the conventional relational model.  In this paper, we present a data
model with a relational algebra and update semantics for a multilevel
secure database system whose protection mechanisms are provided by the
replicated architecture.  The approach is to systematically describe
the effects of treating security labels as data and to define
explicitly the semantics of these data labels for relational database
operations.  We also briefly compare the SINTRA data model to earlier
ones from the SeaView project and their derivations.

There are many known approaches for multilevel secure database

MLS databases, performance has often been sacrificed.  Motivated by
performance concerns, a replicated architecture approach which uses a
physically distinct backend database management system for each
security level is being investigated.  This is a report on the behavior
and performance issues for the replicated architecture approach.
Especially, we compare the performance of the Secure
INformation Through Replicated Architecture (SINTRA) MLS database system to
that of a typical conventional (non-secure, single-level) database
system. After observing the performance bottlenecks for the SINTRA, we
present solutions that can alleviate them.

The database multiple-query optimization can be achieved
by analyzing multiple-query sequences at a level below that used by
current optimizers, but above the low-level executable code.  In this
paper, the concept of the "algorithm-level" representation of a

applied to the algorithm-level representation are discussed.  Some

<blockquote>
There are several proposed approaches for multilevel secure (MLS)
database systems which protect classified information.  The
SINTRA (Secure INformation Through Replicated Architecture)
database system, which is currently being prototyped at the Naval
Research Laboratory, is a multilevel trusted database system based on a
replicated data approach. This approach uses physical separation of
classified data as a protection measure. Each database contains data at
a given security level and replicas of all data at lower security
levels. Project goals include good performance and full database
capability.  For practical reasons (e.g., ease of evaluation, portability) the
SINTRA database system uses as many readily-available commercial
components as possible. In this paper, security constraints and the
rationale for the SINTRA prototype are described.  We also present the
structure and function of each component of the SINTRA prototype: the
global scheduler, the query preprocessor, and the user interface. A
brief description of the SINTRA recovery mechanism is also presented.

The expressiveness of the data model has a significant impact on the
functionality of the resulting database system. The more general the

models can lead to a loss of database functionality or the inability to
model some real world phenomena if data models are not kept general and
independent of other considerations.  We also present our positions
with respect to developing MLS data models for MLS database systems

Communication from a low- to a high-level system without

insecure.  We propose to provide quantifiable security, acceptable
reliability, and minimal performance penalties by interposing a device
(called the Pump) to push messages to the high system and provide a
controlled stream of acknowledgements to the low system.<P>

This paper describes how the Pump supports the transmission of messages
upward and limits the capacity of the covert timing channel in the
acknowledgement stream without affecting the average acknowledgement
delay seen by the low system or the message delivery delay seen by the
high system in the absence of actual Trojan horses.  By adding random
delays to the acknowledgment stream when the Pump's message buffer is
full, we show how to further reduce the covert channel capacity even in
the presence of cooperating Trojan horses in both the high and low
systems.  We also discuss engineering tradeoffs relevant to practical
use of the Pump.

can be chosen based on structural considerations rather than performance.

Replicated architecture has been proposed as a way to obtain acceptable
performance in a multilevel secure database system.  This architecture
contains a separate database for each security level such that each
contains replicated data from lower security classes. The consistency
of the values of replicated data items must be maintained without
unnecessarily interfering with concurrency of database operations. This
paper provides a protocol to do this that is secure, since it is free
of covert channels, and also ensures one-copy serializability of
executing transactions. The protocol can be implemented with untrusted
processes for both concurrency and recovery.

<blockquote>
A user of a database management system has an intuitive idea of a
transaction as a sequence of database commands that he or she submits.
The user expects this sequence of commands to be executed in the order
of submission, without interference from other database commands
submitted by other users. Techniques for doing this while concurrently
supporting multiple database users are well known for conventional
(i.e., not multilevel) database systems. Most of the transaction
management theory for multilevel secure database systems has been
developed for transactions that act within a single security class. In
this paper, we look at transactions that act across security classes,
that is, the transaction is a multilevel sequence of database commands,
which more closely resemble user expectations. We then give an
algorithm for controlling concurrent execution of these transactions on
a particular multilevel secure database architecture.

<blockquote>
There are two components in the scheduler for multilevel-secure
databases which use the replicated architecture; global and local
schedulers.  Since the global scheduler, which enforces data
consistency among replicas, has to make scheduling decisions based on
transactions (i.e., without any knowledge of actual data or physical
layout of data), an accurate analysis technique which can detect
conflicts among queries is needed.  The data dependence analysis
introduced here provides a method for precisely determining whether the
portions of relations affected by various database operations overlap
without the knowledge of actual data.

The concurrency control lock (e.g. file lock, table lock) has long been
used as a canonical example of a covert channel in a database system.
Locking is a fundamental concurrency control technique used in many
kinds of computer systems beside database systems. Locking is generally
considered to be interfering and hence unsuitable for multilevel
systems. In this paper we show how such locks can be used for
concurrency control, without introducing covert channels.

<blockquote>
The replicated architecture for multilevel secure database systems
provides security by replicating data into separate untrusted
single-level database systems. To be successful, a system using the
replicated architecture must have a concurrency and replica control
algorithm that does not introduce any covert channels. Jajodia and
Kogan have developed one such algorithm that uses update projections
and a write-all replica control algorithm. The new algorithm uses
replicated transactions, and a set of queues organized according to
security class. A new definition of correctness is require for this
approach, so we present one and use it to show that our algorithm is
correct. The existence of this new algorithm increases the viability of
the replicated architecture as an alternative to kernelized
approaches.

<blockquote>
DoD operates many system high enclaves with limited information flow
between enclaves at different security levels.  Too often, the result
is duplication of operations and inconsistent and untimely data at
different sites, which reduces the effectiveness of DoD decision
support systems.  This paper describes our solution to this problem as
it arises in installations of the Joint Maritime Command Information
System (JMCIS), an integrated C4I system.  Our approach views
databases in more classified enclaves as potential replica sites for
data from less classified enclaves.  Replicated data flows from lower
enclaves to higher ones via one-way connections, yielding a high
assurance MLS (multi-level secure) distributed system.  The one-way
connections are the only trusted components.  This approach is based
on our work on SINTRA (Secure Information Through Replicated
Architecture), and applies generally to any collection of systems each
running a database at system high.  It complements and exploits modern
system design methods, which separate data management from data
processing, and enables effective, low-cost MLS operation within that
paradigm.  In addition to describing current JMCIS installations and
our architectural approach, the paper presents our approach for
justifying a system's security and our use of formal methods to
increase assurance that security requirements are met.

<blockquote>
DoD system high enclaves are often isolated from systems at other
security levels because the usual connectors (guards) are expensive to
procure, integrate, accredit, and operate, and usually require a human
in the middle to review the data flow, independent of direction.  This
isolation reduces the effectiveness of information systems.  The
secure store and forward devices described in this paper can be used
to solve an important (yet tractable) half of the problem: moving data
from LOW to HIGH without a human in the middle.  These devices were
expressly designed to be easy to accredit.  Security critical function
is both minimized and separated from non-security critical function to
reduce the need for trusted components.  A prototype implementation of
one of these store and forward devices is described as well.

<blockquote>
Distributed object-oriented computing (DOC) is a new computing paradigm that
promotes component-based development, location independence, scalability,
software reuse, etc. Users of multilevel security (MLS) technology want to
take advantage of these new technologies. However,  the process of
incorporating new technologies into MLS products is slower than the
analogous process for non-secure commercial products because MLS products
must go through rigorous evaluation/certification procedures.
<p>
We propose an architectural framework that speeds up the process of
introducing new technologies to MLS users. We examine the drawbacks of
traditional MLS approaches and take a fresh look at the requirements of  MLS
users. We then introduce security-critical components that can enable MLS
solutions and an MLS architectural framework that can accommodate not only
legacy systems but also new technologies, including DOC, without
jeopardizing system security.  Our framework separates security critical
components/functions from the rest of the system because these components
must go through rigorous evaluation/certification processes. This approach
enables the secure use of new technologies for MLS users.

<blockquote>
Communication from a low- to a high-level system without
acknowledgements will be unreliable;  with acknowledgements, it can be
insecure.  We propose to provide quantifiable security, acceptable
reliability, and minimal performance penalties by interposing a device
(called the Pump) to push messages to the high system and provide a
controlled stream of acknowledgements to the low system.<P>

This paper describes how the Pump supports the transmission of messages
upward and limits the capacity of the covert timing channel in the
acknowledgement stream without affecting the average acknowledgement
delay seen by the low system or the message delivery delay seen by the
high system in the absence of actual Trojan horses.  By adding random
delays to the acknowledgment stream when the Pump's message buffer is
full, we show how to further reduce the covert channel capacity even in
the presence of cooperating Trojan horses in both the high and low
systems.  We also discuss engineering tradeoffs relevant to practical
use of the Pump.

<blockquote>
As computer systems become more open and interconnected, the need for
reliable and secure communication also increases. In this paper, we
introduce a communication device, the Pump, that balances the
requirements of reliability and security. The Pump provides
acknowledgements (ACKs) to the message source to insure reliability.  These
ACKsare also used to regulate the source to prevent the Pump's buffer from
becoming/staying full. This is desirable because once the buffer is filled 
exists a huge covert communication channel. The Pump controls the input rate
from the source by attempting to slave the input rate to the service rate 
through the randomized ACK back to the source.

An analysis of the covert channel  is also presented.  The purpose of
the covert channel analysis is to provide guidelines for the designer
of the Pump to choose appropriate design parameters (e.g., size of
buffer) dependent upon the analysis presented in this paper and system
requirements.

<blockquote>
Military systems that process classified information must operate in a
secure manner; i.e., they must adequately protect information against
unauthorized disclosure, modification, and withholding.  A goal of current
research in computer security is to facilitate the construction of
"multilevel secure systems," systems that protect information of different
classifications from users with different clearances.  Security models are
used to define the concept of security embodied by a computer system.  A
single model, called the Bell and LaPadula model, has dominated recent efforts
to build secure systems but has deficiencies.  We are developing a new
approach to defining security models based on the idea that a security model
should be derived from a specific application.  To evaluate our approach, we
have formulated a security model for a family of military message systems.
This paper introduces the message system application, describes the problems of
using the Bell-LaPadula model in real applications, and presents our security
model both informally and formally.  Significant aspects of the security 
model are its definition of multi-level objects and its inclusion of
application-dependent security assertions.  Prototypes based on this model
are being developed.

<blockquote>
One of the most striking properties of the ``Trusted Computer System
Evaluation Criteria'' and its international successors is that none of
these documents contain any attempt to relate their evaluation levels
to a measure of how much effort must be expended to break into a
system.  As a consequence, it's impossible to evaluate rationally the
marginal benefit of spending the extra money necessary to obtain a
higher rating than a lower one.  One reason for this gap between
evaluation levels and cost of system penetration is the difficulty of
quantifying penetration costs.  In this paper I hope to shed some
light on the questions of what is needed, what we have, and what it
would be useful to have in the future.

To evaluate the effectiveness of techniques used to build secure
systems some sort of quantitative measure of penetration resistance is
desirable.  However, fuzzy logic is the wrong way to go since a single
fuzzy metric of system security hides the information that was used to
generate the metric and since there is an inherent danger of giving
quantitative fuzzy metrics more credence than they really
deserve. Certainly with respect to confidentiality, and possibly with
respect to integrity and availability as well, information theoretic
approaches, though not perfect, are more suitable.  Money would be
better spent furthering such approaches, rather than developing fuzzy
new ones.

Our timed Z-channel (a general case of the Z-channel) appears as
the basis for a large class of covert channels.  Golomb analyzed the
Z-channel, a memoryless channel with two input symbols and two
output symbols, where one of the input symbols is transmitted with
noise while the other is transmitted without noise, and the output
symbol transmission times are equal.  We introduce the timed
Z-channel, where the output symbol transmission times are different.
Specifically, we show how the timed Z-channel applies to two examples
of covert timing channel scenarios: a CPU scheduler, and a token ring
network.  We then give a detailed analysis of our timed Z-channel.  We
report a new result expressing the capacity of the timed Z-channel as
the log of the root of a trinomial equation.  This changes the capacity
calculation from an optimization problem into a simpler algebraic
problem and illustrates the relationship between the noise and time
factors.  Further, it generalizes Shannon's work on noiseless channels
for this special case.  We also report a new result bounding the timed
Z-channel's capacity from below.  Finally, we show how an interesting
observation that Golomb reported for the Z-channel also holds for the
timed Z-channel.

A designer of reliable MLS networks must consider covert channels
and denial of service attacks in addition to traditional network
performance measures such as throughput, fairness, and reliability.
In this paper we show how to extend the NRL data Pump to a certain MLS
network architecture in order to balance the requirements of congestion
control, fairness, good performance, and reliability against those of
minimal threats from covert channels and denial of service attacks.  We
back up our claims with simulation results.

<blockquote>
We set out a logic for reasoning about multilevel security of probabilistic systems.  This logic includes modalities for time, knowledge, and probability.
In earlier work we gave syntactic definitions of multilevel security and showed that their semantic interpretations are equivalent to independently motivated
information-theoretic definitions.  This paper builds on that earlier work in two ways.  First, it substantially recasts the language and model of computation into the more standard Halpern-Tuttle framework for reasoning about
knowledge and probability. Second, it brings together two distinct characterizations of security from that work.  One was equivalent to the information-theoretic security criterion for a system to be free of covert channels but was difficult to prove. The other was a verification condition
that implied the first; it was more easily provable but was too strong.  This paper presents a characterization that is syntactically very similar to our previous verification condition but is proven to be semantically equivalent to the security criterion.  The new characterization also means that our security criterion is expressible in a simpler logic and model.

The NRL Protocol Analyzer is a tool for proving security properties
of cryptographic protocols, and for finding flaws if they exist.
It is used by having the user first prove a number of lemmas stating
that infinite classes of states are unreachable, and then performing
an exhaustive search on the remaining state space.  One main source 
of difficulty in using the tool is in generating the lemmas that are to 
be proved.  In this paper we show how we have made the task easier
by automating the generation of lemmas involving the use of formal 
languages.

<blockquote>
Recent papers have taken a new look at cryptographic protocols
from the perspective of proposing design principles. For years
the main approach to cryptographic protocols has been logical,
and a number of papers have examined the limitations of those logics.
This paper takes a similar cautionary look at the design principal
approach. Limitations and exceptions are offered on some of
the previously given basic design principals. The focus is primarily
on public key protocols, especially on the order of signature
and encryption. But, other principles are discussed as well.
Apparently secure protocols that fail to meet principles are presented.
Also presented are new attacks on protocols as well as previously
claimed attacks which are not.

<blockquote>
Dependability is that property of a computer system such that reliance can
justifiably be placed on the service it delivers.  In this paper, we contrast the
different ways faults are handled in the dependability paradigm with the way
they are handled in the current paradigms for secure system design.  We 
show how the current security paradigm is generally restricted to a subset of
the types of approaches used in dependability, largely concentrating on
fault prevention and removal while neglecting fault tolerance and forecast,
and argue that this paradigm is fast becoming obsolete.  We discuss the
implications of extending the security paradigm to cover the full range
of options covered by dependability.  In particular, we develop a rough
outline of a fault model for security and show how it could be applied to
better our understanding of the place of both fault tolerance and fault
forecast in computer security.

Society Press, 1995, pp. 530-541
<blockquote>
Integrity is usually considered to be at odds with security in multilevel databases.  Integrity constraints enforce conditions on relations between data,
while security constraints enforce separation between data.  If an integrity constraint is defined over data at different security levels, a direct conflict results.  However, the solution is not to sacrifice the integrity constraint
altogether.  Compromise solutions can often be found that guaranteed some,
although not all, of the desired results of the constraint.  In this paper, we will show that, by dividing the desired goals of integrity into three areas, consistency, correctness, and availablity, one often find solutions to integrity problems that achieve some, if not all, of the goals without sacrificing security.

<p>
<blockquote>
Paradoxically, one of the most important -- and at the same time,
probably one of  the least understood --  functions performed by information
integrity protocols is to transfer trust from where it exists to where it is
needed. Initially in any protocol, there are at least two types of trust: trust
that designated participants, or groups of participants, will faithfully execute 
their assigned function in the protocol and trust in the integrity of the
transfer mechanism(s) integral to the protocol. Consequently, almost all
protocols enforce a set of restrictions as to who may exercise them -- either
spelled out explicitly or left implicit in the protocol specification. In
addition there may be unanticipated or even unacceptable groupings of
participants who can also exercise the protocol as a result of actions taken by
some of the participants reflecting trusts that exist among them. Formal methods 
are developed to analyze trust as a fundamental dimension in  protocol analysis
and proof.

<blockquote>
We present a methodology to facilitate the design and analysis of secure cryptographic protocols.  We advocate the general approach, and a new avenue for research, of restricting protocol designs to well-defined practices, instead of ever increasing the complexity of protocol security analysis mechanisms to deal with every newly discovered attack and the endless variations in protocol construction.  In particular, we propose a novel notion of a fail-stop protocol, which automatically halts in response to any active attack that interferes with protocol execution, thus reducing protocol security
analysis to that of passive attacks only.  We suggest types of protocols that are fail-stop, outline some proof techniques for them, and use examples to illustrate how the notion of a fail-stop protocol can make protocol design easier and can provide a more solid basis for some available protocol analysis methods.

<blockquote>
In [BAN89] Burrows, Abadi, and Needham presented a
logic (BAN) for analyzing cryptographic protocols in terms of belief.
This logic is quite useful in uncovering flaws in protocols; however, it
also has produced confusion and controversy. Much of the
confusion was cleared up when Abadi and Tuttle provided a semantics
for a version of that logic (AT) in [AT91].<P>

In this paper we present a protocol to show that both BAN and AT are
not expressive enough to capture all of the kinds of flaws that appear to
be within their scope. We then present a logic that adds temporal
formalisms to AT and that is rich enough to reveal the flaws in the
presented protocol; nonetheless, this logic is sound with respect
to the same semantics that was given in [AT91]. Finally, we argue
that any approach of this type is inadequate by itself to demonstrate
the absence of such flaws. We must
supplement the formal logic with semantic analysis techniques.

<blockquote>
In [KSL92], Kehne et al. present a protocol (KSL) for key distribution.
Their protocol allows for repeated authentication 
by means of a ticket. They also give a proof in BAN logic [BAN89]
that the protocol provides the principals with a reasonable degree of
trust in the authentication and key distribution. They present an optimality
result that their protocol contains a minimal number of messages.
Nonetheless, in [NS93] Neuman and Stubblebine present a
protocol (NS) as an explicit alternative to KSL that requires one less
message in the initial authentication and key distribution.
One goal of this paper is to examine some of the reasons for this discrepancy.
Another goal is to demonstrate possible attacks on NS.
Like any attacks on cryptographic protocols, these
depend on assumptions about implementation
details. But, when possible they are serious: a penetrator
can initiate the protocol, masquerade as another principal,
obtain the session key, and even generate the session key herself.
We will set out implementation assumptions required for the attacks to
take place and implementation assumptions that preclude such an attack. 
We will also look at other protocols, including one that is not subject
to this form of attack and has the same number of messages as NS.
Finally, we will briefly discuss the logical analysis of these repeat 
authentication protocols.

interpreted as a set of information and authorizations for the
manipulation of that information in a computer system.
Architectural requirements are grouped in three categories:
logical structure, the processing of logical structures, and physical 
structure.  These criteria were developed in order to assess the 
utility of Navy standard computers as bases for secure embedded systems,
but they are not specific to those computers.

<blockquote>
Military systems that process classified information must operate in a
secure manner; i.e., they must adequately protect information against
unauthorized disclosure, modification, and withholding.  A goal of current
research in computer security is to facilitate the construction of
"multilevel secure systems," systems that protect information of different
classifications from users with different clearances.  Security models are
used to define the concept of security embodied by a computer system.  A
single model, called the Bell and LaPadula model, has dominated recent efforts
to build secure systems but has deficiencies.  We are developing a new
approach to defining security models based on the idea that a security model
should be derived from a specific application.  To evaluate our approach, we
have formulated a security model for a family of military message systems.
This paper introduces the message system application, describes the problems of
using the Bell-LaPadula model in real applications, and presents our security
model both informally and formally.  Significant aspects of the security 
model are its definition of multi-level objects and its inclusion of
application-dependent security assertions.  Prototypes based on this model
are being developed.

<blockquote>
The replicated architecture for multilevel secure database systems
provides security by replicating data into separate untrusted
single-level database systems. To be successful, a system using the
replicated architecture must have a concurrency and replica control
algorithm that does not introduce any covert channels. Jajodia and
Kogan have developed one such algorithm that uses update projections
and a write-all replica control algorithm. The new algorithm uses
replicated transactions, and a set of queues organized according to
security class. A new definition of correctness is require for this
approach, so we present one and use it to show that our algorithm is
correct. The existence of this new algorithm increases the viability of
the replicated architecture as an alternative to kernelized
approaches.

<blockquote>
Replicated architecture has been proposed as a way to obtain acceptable
performance in a multilevel secure database system.  This architecture
contains a separate database for each security level such that each
contains replicated data from lower security classes. The consistency
of the values of replicated data items must be maintained without
unnecessarily interfering with concurrency of database operations. This
paper provides a protocol to do this that is secure, since it is free
of covert channels, and also ensures one-copy serializability of
executing transactions. The protocol can be implemented with untrusted
processes for both concurrency and recovery.

<blockquote>
A user of a database management system has an intuitive idea of a
transaction as a sequence of database commands that he or she submits.
The user expects this sequence of commands to be executed in the order
of submission, without interference from other database commands
submitted by other users. Techniques for doing this while concurrently
supporting multiple database users are well known for conventional
(i.e., not multilevel) database systems. Most of the transaction
management theory for multilevel secure database systems has been
developed for transactions that act within a single security class. In
this paper, we look at transactions that act across security classes,
that is, the transaction is a multilevel sequence of database commands,
which more closely resemble user expectations. We then give an
algorithm for controlling concurrent execution of these transactions on
a particular multilevel secure database architecture.

<blockquote>
The ECA is an embedded computing device that processes message
traffic for a network that must enforce end-to-end user message
confidentiality.  The ECA uses a commercial, off-the-shelf
cryptographic device to transform sensitive data from the Red Domain
of the network so that it can be transmitted over the untrusted
communications links of the Black Domain.  For transmission purposes,
certain parts of a message, namely the message header, must be
bypassed around the cryptographic device.  The primary critical
requirement for the ECA, "Restricted Red-to-Black Flow" (RRTBF),
requires that the bypassed portion of each message must satisfy
certain format restrictions, and that the rate of bypass must be
constrained.  In this report, we present an informal model of the
ECA's critical requirements together with the assumptions under which
the model was constructed.  We then formalize this model by using the
CSP Trace Model of computation.

<blockquote>
We resolve a debate over the appropriateness for
cryptographic protocol analysis of formalisms representing

are equally adequate for protocol analysis on the logical level.
We discuss the significance of semantics for logics of cryptographic protocols.
In particular, we look at semantics as a measure of a logic and as a reasoning
tool in its own right. To illustrate the value of a semantics we use the
semantics given in [Abadi and Tuttle 91] to resolve a debate over an
alleged flaw in BAN, the logic of [Burrows, Abadi, and Needham 89].

In most models of trusted database systems, transactions are considered

Communication from a low- to a high-level system without
acknowledgements will be unreliable;  with acknowledgements, it can be
insecure.  We propose to provide quantifiable security, acceptable
reliability, and minimal performance penalties by interposing a device
(called the Pump) to push messages to the high system and provide a
controlled stream of acknowledgements to the low system.<P>

This paper describes how the Pump supports the transmission of messages
upward and limits the capacity of the covert timing channel in the
acknowledgement stream without affecting the average acknowledgement
delay seen by the low system or the message delivery delay seen by the
high system in the absence of actual Trojan horses.  By adding random
delays to the acknowledgment stream when the Pump's message buffer is
full, we show how to further reduce the covert channel capacity even in
the presence of cooperating Trojan horses in both the high and low
systems.  We also discuss engineering tradeoffs relevant to practical
use of the Pump.

The concurrency control lock (e.g. file lock, table lock) has long been
used as a canonical example of a covert channel in a database system.
Locking is a fundamental concurrency control technique used in many
kinds of computer systems beside database systems. Locking is generally
considered to be interfering and hence unsuitable for multilevel
systems. In this paper we show how such locks can be used for
concurrency control, without introducing covert channels.

<blockquote>
Accreditors want to know what vulnerabilities will exist if they decide
to turn on a system.  TCSEC evaluations address products, not systems.
Not only the hardware and software of a system are of concern;  the
accreditor needs to view the system components in relation to the
environment in which they operate and in relation to the system's
mission.  This paper proposes an informal but comprehensive approach
that can provide the accreditor with the necessary information.  First,
we discuss the identification of assumptions and assertions that
reflect system INFOSEC requirements.  Second, we propose the definition
of an assurance strategy to integrate security engineering and system
engineering.  The assurance strategy initially documents the set of
assumptions and assertions derived from the requirements  It is
elaborated and refined throughout the development, yielding the
assurance argument, delivered with the system, which provides the
primary technical basis for the certification decision. With the
assurance strategy in place, certification of the trusted system can
become an audit of the development process.

<blockquote>
In [BAN89] Burrows, Abadi, and Needham presented a
logic (BAN) for analyzing cryptographic protocols in terms of belief.
This logic is quite useful in uncovering flaws in protocols; however, it
also has produced confusion and controversy. Much of the
confusion was cleared up when Abadi and Tuttle provided a semantics
for a version of that logic (AT) in [AT91].<P>

In this paper we present a protocol to show that both BAN and AT are
not expressive enough to capture all of the kinds of flaws that appear to
be within their scope. We then present a logic that adds temporal
formalisms to AT and that is rich enough to reveal the flaws in the
presented protocol; nonetheless, this logic is sound with respect
to the same semantics that was given in [AT91]. Finally, we argue
that any approach of this type is inadequate by itself to demonstrate
the absence of such flaws. We must
supplement the formal logic with semantic analysis techniques.

 PostScript</a>

<blockquote>
In [KSL92], Kehne et al. present a protocol (KSL) for key distribution.
Their protocol allows for repeated authentication 
by means of a ticket. They also give a proof in BAN logic [BAN89]
that the protocol provides the principals with a reasonable degree of
trust in the authentication and key distribution. They present an optimality
result that their protocol contains a minimal number of messages.
Nonetheless, in [NS93] Neuman and Stubblebine present a
protocol (NS) as an explicit alternative to KSL that requires one less
message in the initial authentication and key distribution.
One goal of this paper is to examine some of the reasons for this discrepancy.
Another goal is to demonstrate possible attacks on NS.
Like any attacks on cryptographic protocols, these
depend on assumptions about implementation
details. But, when possible they are serious: a penetrator
can initiate the protocol, masquerade as another principal,
obtain the session key, and even generate the session key herself.
We will set out implementation assumptions required for the attacks to
take place and implementation assumptions that preclude such an attack. 
We will also look at other protocols, including one that is not subject
to this form of attack and has the same number of messages as NS.
Finally, we will briefly discuss the logical analysis of these repeat 
authentication protocols.

Unlike previous approaches to developing a trusted

trusted database system which shows how the logical (users') view of
the system and its security policy is translated into the physical

Relational database systems are based on a powerful abstraction:  the
relational data model with the relational algebra and update
semantics.  If the database design (i. e., the way the data is
organized) satisfies criteria provided by this foundation, users have
assurance that they can retrieve information in a consistent,
predictable way.  Multilevel secure database systems must not only
provide assurance that information is protected based on its
sensitivity, but should be based on a data model as sound and complete
as the conventional relational model.  In this paper, we present a data
model with a relational algebra and update semantics for a multilevel
secure database system whose protection mechanisms are provided by the
replicated architecture.  The approach is to systematically describe
the effects of treating security labels as data and to define
explicitly the semantics of these data labels for relational database
operations.  We also briefly compare the SINTRA data model to earlier
ones from the SeaView project and their derivations.

Especially, we compare the performance of the Secure

There are several proposed approaches for multilevel secure (MLS)
database systems which protect classified information.  The
SINTRA (Secure INformation Through Replicated Architecture)
database system, which is currently being prototyped at the Naval
Research Laboratory, is a multilevel trusted database system based on a
replicated data approach. This approach uses physical separation of
classified data as a protection measure. Each database contains data at
a given security level and replicas of all data at lower security
levels. Project goals include good performance and full database
capability.  For practical reasons (e.g., ease of evaluation, portability) the
SINTRA database system uses as many readily-available commercial
components as possible. In this paper, security constraints and the
rationale for the SINTRA prototype are described.  We also present the
structure and function of each component of the SINTRA prototype: the
global scheduler, the query preprocessor, and the user interface. A
brief description of the SINTRA recovery mechanism is also presented.

<blockquote>
One of the most striking properties of the ``Trusted Computer System
Evaluation Criteria'' and its international successors is that none of
these documents contain any attempt to relate their evaluation levels
to a measure of how much effort must be expended to break into a
system.  As a consequence, it's impossible to evaluate rationally the
marginal benefit of spending the extra money necessary to obtain a
higher rating than a lower one.  One reason for this gap between
evaluation levels and cost of system penetration is the difficulty of
quantifying penetration costs.  In this paper I hope to shed some
light on the questions of what is needed, what we have, and what it
would be useful to have in the future.

To evaluate the effectiveness of techniques used to build secure

desirable.  However, fuzzy logic is the wrong way to go since a single
fuzzy metric of system security hides the information that was used to
generate the metric and since there is an inherent danger of giving
quantitative fuzzy metrics more credence than they really
deserve. Certainly with respect to confidentiality, and possibly with
respect to integrity and availability as well, information theoretic
approaches, though not perfect, are more suitable.  Money would be
better spent furthering such approaches, rather than developing fuzzy
new ones.

approach for building high assurance systems for particular application
domains.  This paper introduces an application domain called "selective
bypass" that is prominent in certain network security solutions.  We
present a parameterized modeling framework for the domain and then
instantiate a confidentiality model for a particular application,
called the External COMSEC Adaptor (ECA), within the framework.  We
conclude with lessons we learned from modeling, implementing and
verifying the ECA.  Our experience supports the use of the 
application-based security modeling approach for high assurance systems.

We discuss generic formal requirements for reasoning about

security requirements for security protocols.
Typically earlier work has considered
formal analysis of already developed protocols. Our goal is to present
sets of formal requirements for various contexts which can be applied
at the design stage as well as to existing protocols.
We use a protocol analysis tool we have developed to determine whether or
not a specific protocol has met some of the requirements we specified.
We show how this process uncovered a flaw in the protocol and helped us
refine our requirements.

This paper presents a taxonomy of replay attacks
on cryptographic protocols in terms of message origin and destination.
The taxonomy is independent of any method used to analyze or
prevent such attacks. It is also complete in the sense
that any replay attack is composed entirely of
elements classified by the taxonomy. The classification of attacks
is illustrated using both new and previously known attacks on protocols.
The taxonomy is also used to discuss the appropriateness of particular
countermeasures and protocol analysis methods to particular kinds of replays.

<blockquote>
Deciding precisely what to build and documenting the results is the
goal of the requirements phase of software development. Experience
shows that requirements are the biggest software engineering problem
for developers of large, complex systems. The purpose of this tutorial
is to help the reader understand why requirements are so difficult to
do well, where the state of the art does and does not address current
development problems, the strengths and weaknesses of different
approaches to requirements, and what help we can expect from ongoing
technical developments.
<p>
Focus of the tutorial is on providing the reader with an understanding
of the underlying issues in requirements analysis and specification. It
describes the different facets of the requirements problem from the
points of view of the many parties involved in system development
including customers, contractors, management, regulators, and
developers. It discusses the goals of the requirements phase and the
problems that can arise in achieving those goals. It describes the
characteristics of a disciplined software engineering process and how
such a process helps address many of the problems in requirements. It
compares a variety of published approaches relative to the goals of a
disciplined process. Finally it examines technical trends, including
recent work at the Naval Research Laboratory, and discusses where
significant advances are likely in the future.

<blockquote>
DoD operates many system high enclaves with limited information flow
between enclaves at different security levels.  Too often, the result
is duplication of operations and inconsistent and untimely data at
different sites, which reduces the effectiveness of DoD decision
support systems.  This paper describes our solution to this problem as
it arises in installations of the Joint Maritime Command Information
System (JMCIS), an integrated C4I system.  Our approach views
databases in more classified enclaves as potential replica sites for
data from less classified enclaves.  Replicated data flows from lower
enclaves to higher ones via one-way connections, yielding a high
assurance MLS (multi-level secure) distributed system.  The one-way
connections are the only trusted components.  This approach is based
on our work on SINTRA (Secure Information Through Replicated
Architecture), and applies generally to any collection of systems each
running a database at system high.  It complements and exploits modern
system design methods, which separate data management from data
processing, and enables effective, low-cost MLS operation within that
paradigm.  In addition to describing current JMCIS installations and
our architectural approach, the paper presents our approach for
justifying a system's security and our use of formal methods to
increase assurance that security requirements are met.

<blockquote>
As computer systems become more open and interconnected, the need for
reliable and secure communication also increases. In this paper, we
introduce a communication device, the Pump, that balances the
requirements of reliability and security. The Pump provides
acknowledgements (ACKs) to the message source to insure reliability.  These
ACKsare also used to regulate the source to prevent the Pump's buffer from
becoming/staying full. This is desirable because once the buffer is filled 
exists a
huge covert communication channel. The Pump controls the input rate
from the source by attempting to slave the input rate to the service rate
through  the randomized ACK back to the source.

An analysis of the covert channel  is also presented.  The purpose of
the covert channel analysis is to provide guidelines for the designer
of the Pump to choose appropriate design parameters (e.g., size of
buffer) dependent upon the analysis presented in this paper and system
requirements.

<blockquote>
In the past, the most likely motive for attacks that modify data would have been
financial gain.  However, changes in technology have made many organizations 
so dependent on information systems that it is now possible to disrupt or
degrade their operations by interfering with their supporting information systems.  
When this disruption is accomplished by unauthorized modification of data we call 
it storage jamming.  Storage jamming is the malicious modification of stored data, 
done for the purpose of degrading or disrupting real-world operations that depend 
on the correctness of the data. We assume the person initiating the malicious modification 
(frequently via a Trojan horse) does not receive any direct benefit, financial or otherwise, 
but rather is motivated by more indirect goals such as improving the competitive position 
of his or her own organization. The main goal of this paper is to define storage jamming.  
We also discuss our work to date on possible defenses against it; in order to make the 
case that there are solutions.  In the next section we discuss the nature of storage jamming 
including possible jamming strategies and vulnerability to jamming. The next two sections 
discuss a variety of anti-jamming techniques.  Some of these candidate techniques are based 
on previous work on security-oriented data integrity but are unsuitable for use against 
jamming attacks. We then discuss a particular kind of anti-jamming mechanism called a 
detection object. The paper ends with a summary and discussion of future work.

        Many scientific approaches for specifying, constructing, and certifying
high assurance systems have been developed, including formal verification and
validation techniques.  Much still needs to be done with respect to individual
critical properties (e.g., safety, security, and timeliness).  Even more needs
to be done with respect to (1) the lack of technology support for applying these techniques to practical, real-word systems, and (2) the lack of a unified
framework for building systems that satisfy several critical properties.  These
problems are of such a difficult nature that they will not be solved by industry or academia without the support of both government funding agencies and government research laboratories.  This paper summarizes the results of a
workshop in which a group of 50 experts from academia, government, and industry

Dependability is that property of a computer system such that reliance can

different ways faults are handled in the dependability paradigm with the way 
they are handled in the current paradigms for secure system design.  We show 
how the current security paradigm is generally restricted to a subset of
the types of approaches used in dependability, largely concentrating on
fault prevention and removal while neglecting fault tolerance and forecast,
and argue that this paradigm is fast becoming obsolete.  We discuss the
implications of extending the security paradigm to cover the full range
of options covered by dependability.  In particular, we develop a rough
outline of a fault model for security and show how it could be applied to
better our understanding of the place of both fault tolerance and fault

<blockquote>
Integrity is usually considered to be at odds with security in multilevel databases.  Integrity constraints enforce conditions on relations between data,
while security constraints enforce separation between data.  If an integrity constraint is defined over data at different security levels, a direct conflict results.  However, the solution is not to sacrifice the integrity constraint
altogether.  Compromise solutions can often be found that guaranteed some,
although not all, of the desired results of the constraint.  In this paper, we will show that, by dividing the desired goals of integrity into three areas, consistency, correctness, and availablity, one often find solutions to integrity problems that achieve some, if not all, of the goals without sacrificing security.

<blockquote>
Paradoxically, one of the most important -- and at the same time,
probably one of  the least understood --  functions performed by information
integrity protocols is to transfer trust from where it exists to where it is
needed. Initially in any protocol, there are at least two types of trust: trust
that designated participants, or groups of participants, will faithfully execute their assigned function in the protocol and trust in the integrity of the
transfer mechanism(s) integral to the protocol. Consequently, almost all
protocols enforce a set of restrictions as to who may exercise them -- either
spelled out explicitly or left implicit in the protocol specification. In
addition there may be unanticipated or even unacceptable groupings of
participants who can also exercise the protocol as a result of actions taken by
some of the participants reflecting trusts that exist among them. Formal methods are developed to analyze trust as a fundamental dimension in  protocol analysis
and proof.

The External COMSEC Adaptor (ECA) is a device responsible for providing cryptographic protection based on rules that (possibly coarsely) define the sensitivity of that information.  The ECA is trusted to satisfy a set of criteria requirements that support data confidentiality in the network in which it is embedded.  Ensuring that the ECA is worthy of this trust requires defining its critical requirements precisely and constructing a strong argument that its implementation satisfies these requirements.  This paper describes a software engineering methodology that uses formal methods for specifying and verifying the overall function rquirements of the ECA.  The methodology integrates the formal specifications and proofs with structured software documenation to clarify the relationship between the refinement of ECA functionality and the argument that the ECA meets its critical requirements.  This methodology was used successfully to build the ECA using the KG84A to satisfy its cryptographic requirements.

<blockquote>
The definition of an "appropriate fashion" comes from the system's security
policy, and from security requirements which are detailed in the descriptive
top-level specification (DTLS).  The detailed information necessary to convince
the evaluators that a system can be trusted to manage sensitive data is provided
in the form of an assurance mapping between the trusted computing base (TCB),
which implements the security related functions, and the security policy,
which defines the secure behavior of those functions.  The job of the developers
is to sell the trustworthiness of the system to the evaluators using these
mappings by making a convincing argument that the TCB correctly enforces the
security policy.  In other words, the developer must convince the evaluators
that the physical machine embodied in the TCB is an accurate simulation of the
true, abstract machine prescribed the security policy.  The abstract machine is
first described in the Security Policy Model.  This chapter identifies the certification goals for the assurance mappings.  Unlike other certification deliverables, the assurance mappings are generated throughout the development life cycle.  They are a collection of documents rather than a single document, and a member of the collection may be part of another certification deliverable, such as the Security Policy Model.  The developer must present the mappings as a coherent whole.  This chapter also describes methods that can be used to hand-examine the code for minimality, because the TCSEC also requires the TCB to be "minimized" in the sense that it contains nothing not required to correctly implement the security-related functions. Proving that this requirement has been met is very difficult to do.

<blockquote>
The security policy model (SPM) is the apex of the assurance argument in the
development of a trustworthy system.  A system is trustworthy if the probability of a catastrophic flaw remaining after testing and review is acceptably low.  In our case the correct behavior is described informally in a security policy.  The SPM presents the constraints of the security policy in a way that can be analyzed formally.  It guides the developer toward a secure design and implementation and helps the developer demonstrate rigorously that the system enforces its security policy.  The SPM describes the system's security-relevant behavior for the user.  Without the SPM, the security-relevant goals of the system are not well-defined for the developer, the user, or the evaluator.  The SPM expresses the definition of security for a trusted system.  In this chapter, we instruct the evaluator in the assessment that an SPM fulfills the purposes identified above.  We identify the structure of an SPM and guide the evaluator in the analysis of the structure.  The SPM is influenced heavily by the critical requirements of the relationships between those entities.  We discuss one way to determine if the appropriate entities and relationships have been modeled and if the critical requirements on those
entities have been satisfied.  We do not try to determine what constitutes a
good definition of security for a trusted system.  References are provided on
this topic.  Much research has been performed already regarding good definitions of security.  We concentrate on the evaluation of the structures in the SPM that support the definition of security.

We set out a logic for reasoning about multilevel security of probabilistic systems.  This logic includes modalities for time, knowledge, and probability.
In earlier work we gave syntactic definitions of multilevel security and showed that their semantic interpretations are equivalent to independently motivated
information-theoretic definitions.  This paper builds on that earlier work in two ways.  First, it substantially recasts the language and model of computation into the more standard Halpern-Tuttle framework for reasoning about
knowledge and probability. Second, it brings together two distinct characterizations of security from that work.  One was equivalent to the information-theoretic security criterion for a system to be free of covert channels but was difficult to prove. The other was a verification condition
that implied the first; it was more easily provable but was too strong.  This paper presents a characterization that is syntactically very similar to our previous verification condition but is proven to be semantically equivalent to the security criterion.  The new characterization also means that our security criterion is expressible in a simpler logic and model.

We advocate the general approach, and a new avenue for research, of restricting protocol designs to well-defined practices, instead of ever increasing the complexity of protocol security analysis mechanisms to deal with every newly discovered attack and the endless variations in protocol construction.  In particular, we propose a novel notion of a fail-stop protocol, which automatically halts in response to any active attack that interferes with protocol execution, thus reducing protocol security
analysis to that of passive attacks only.  We suggest types of protocols that are fail-stop, outline some proof techniques for them, and use examples to illustrate how the notion of a fail-stop protocol can make protocol design easier and can provide a more solid basis for some available protocol analysis methods.

Archer, Myla M. and Heitmeyer, Constance L., "TAME: A Specialized
Specification and Verification System for Timed Automata," Presented
in the Work in Progress session at RTSS '96, Washington, D.C., December
4-6, 1996.  
<a href="1996archer-RTSS96.ps">PostScript</a>
<blockquote>
Assuring the correctness of specifications of real-time systems
can involve significant human effort.  The use of  a mechanical theorem 
prover to encode such specifications and to verify their properties
could significantly reduce this effort.  A barrier to routinely encoding 
and mechanically verifying specifications has been the need first to 
master the specification language and logic of a general theorem proving 
system.  Our approach to overcoming this barrier is to provide mechanical
support for producing specifications and verifying proofs, specialized for 
particular mathematical models and proof techniques.  We are currently 
developing a mechanical verification system called TAME (Timed Automata 
Modeling Environment) that provides this specialized support using SRI's
Prototype Verification System (PVS).  Our system is intended to permit 
steps in reasoning similar to those in hand proofs that use model-specific 
techniques.  TAME has recently been used to detect errors in a realistic 
example.

Timed Automata: A Case Study,"  Proceedings of the 1996 Real-Time 
Technology and Applications Symposium, 1996.  
<a href="1996archer-RTAS96.ps">PostScript</a>
<blockquote>
This paper reports the results of a case study on the feasibility of
developing and applying mechanical methods, based on the proof
system PVS, to prove propositions about real-time systems specified
in the Lynch-Vaandrager timed automata model.  In using automated
provers to prove propositions about systems described by a specific
mathematical model, both the proofs and the proof process can be
simplified by exploiting the special properties of the mathematical
model.  This paper presents the PVS specification of three theories
that underlie the timed automata model, a template for specifying
timed automata models in PVS and an example of its instantiation,
and both hand proofs and the corresponding PVS proofs of two
propositions.  It concludes with a discussion of our experience in
applying PVS to specify and reason about real-time systems modeled
as timed automata.

USENIX Association, San Diego, California, January 1996. pp. 113-125.
<blockquote>
The widespread availability of the TCP/IP protocols in early
versions of BSD UNIX fostered the current widespread use of those 
protocols in commercial products.  Recently the Internet Engineering
Task Force (IETF) has designed version 6 of the Internet Protocol
(IPv6).  IPv6 has some similarities with IPv4, but it also has
many differences, most notably in address size.  This paper describes
our experience creating a freely distributable implementation of
IPv6 inside 4.4 BSD, with focus on the areas that have changed between
the IPv4 and IPv6 implementations.

Proceedings of the Third ACM Conference on Computer and Communications 
Security, New Delhi, India, March 1996.  
<a href="1996goldschlag-ACMccs.ps">PostScript</a>
<blockquote>
DoD system high enclaves are often isolated from systems at other
security levels because the usual connectors (guards) are expensive to
procure, integrate, accredit, and operate, and usually require a human
in the middle to review the data flow, independent of direction.  This
isolation reduces the effectiveness of information systems.  The
secure store and forward devices described in this paper can be used
to solve an important (yet tractable) half of the problem: moving data
from LOW to HIGH without a human in the middle.  These devices were
expressly designed to be easy to accredit.  Security critical function
is both minimized and separated from non-security critical function to
reduce the need for trusted components.  A prototype implementation of
one of these store and forward devices is described as well.

Routing Information," Workshop on Information Hiding, Cambridge, UK,
May 1996.  <a href="1996goldschlag-workshop-UK.ps">PostScript</a>

<blockquote>
This paper describes an architecture, Onion Routing, that limits a
network's vulnerability to traffic analysis.  The architecture
provides anonymous socket connections by means of proxy servers.  It
provides real-time, bi-directional, anonymous communication for any
protocol that can be adapted to use a proxy service.  Specifically,
the architecture provides for bi-directional communication even though
no-one but the initiator's proxy server knows anything but previous
and next hops in the communication chain.  This implies that neither
the respondent nor his proxy server nor any external observer need
know the identity of the initiator or his proxy server.  A prototype
of Onion Routing has been implemented.  This prototype works with HTTP
(World Wide Web) proxies.  In addition, an analogous proxy for TELNET
has been implemented.  Proxies for FTP and SMTP are under development.

<blockquote>
This paper presents a formal framework for representing and reasoning
about the requirements of hybrid computer systems.  By a hybrid
computer system, we mean a computer system whose environment includes
both continuous and discrete entities.  As background, the paper
briefly reviews an abstract model for specifying system and software
requirements,  called the Four Variable Model, and a related
requirements method, called   SCR (Software Cost Reduction).  The paper
then introduces  a special discrete version of the Four Variable Model,
called the SCR requirements model,  and  suggests how the  SCR model
can be extended to specify and to reason about hybrid systems. Examples
of how the SCR model can be used to specify  a system's timing and
accuracy requirements are given.

ACM Trans. on Software Eng. and Methodology 5, 3, July 1996, 
231-261.  <a href="1996heitmeyer-ACM.ps">PostScript</a>
<blockquote>
This paper describes a formal analysis technique, called
consistency checking, for automatic detection of errors, such as  type
errors, nondeterminism, missing cases, and circular definitions, in
requirements specifications.  The technique is designed to analyze
requirements specifications  expressed in the SCR (Software Cost
Reduction) tabular notation.  As background,  the SCR approach to
specifying requirements is reviewed.  To provide a formal semantics for
the SCR notation and a foundation for consistency checking, a formal
requirements model is introduced; the  model represents a software
system as a finite state automaton, which produces externally visible
outputs in response to changes in monitored environmental quantities.
Results are presented of two experiments which evaluated the utility
and scalability of our technique for consistency checking in a
real-world avionics application.  The role of consistency checking
during the requirements phase of software development is discussed.

As computer systems become more open and interconnected, the need for
reliable and secure communication also increases. The NRL Pump was
introduced to balance the requirements of reliability, congestion
control, fairness, and good performance against those of  threats from
covert channels and denial of service attacks.
<p>
In this paper, we describe two prototype efforts.  One implements the
Pump at the process (top) layer in terms of a 4-layer network reference
model and the other implements the Pump at the transport layer. We then
discuss lessons learned and how these lessons will be used in deciding
upon the final hardware implementation of the Pump.

for MLS Interoperability," IEEE High Assurance Systems Engineering
Workshop, Niagara-on-the-Lake, 1996.  
<a href="1996mkang-HASE96.ps">PostScript</a>
<blockquote>
Distributed object-oriented computing (DOC) is a new computing paradigm that
promotes component-based development, location independence, scalability,
software reuse, etc. Users of multilevel security (MLS) technology want to
take advantage of these new technologies. However,  the process of
incorporating new technologies into MLS products is slower than the
analogous process for non-secure commercial products because MLS products
must go through rigorous evaluation/certification procedures.
<p>
We propose an architectural framework that speeds up the process of
introducing new technologies to MLS users. We examine the drawbacks of
traditional MLS approaches and take a fresh look at the requirements of  MLS
users. We then introduce security-critical components that can enable MLS
solutions and an MLS architectural framework that can accommodate not only
legacy systems but also new technologies, including DOC, without
jeopardizing system security.  Our framework separates security critical
components/functions from the rest of the system because these components
must go through rigorous evaluation/certification processes. This approach
enables the secure use of new technologies for MLS users.

A designer of reliable multi-level secure (MLS) networks must consider

to a certain MLS network architecture in order to balance the
requirements of congestion control, fairness, good performance, and
reliability against those of minimal threats from covert channels and
denial of service attacks.  We back up our claims with simulation
results.

Workshop, Kenmare, Ireland, June 1996, pp. 176-185.  
<a href="1996mcdermott-9CSFW.ps">PostScript</a>
<blockquote>
Storage jamming can degrade real-world activities that share stored 
data. Storage jamming is not prevented by access controls or cryptographic 
techniques. Verification to rule out storage jamming logic is impractical 
for shrink-wrapped software or low-cost custom applications. Detection 
mechanisms do offer more promise. In this paper, we model storage jamming 
and a detection mechanism, using Unity logic. We find that Unity logic, in 
conjunction with some high-level operators, models storage jamming in a 
natural way and allows us to reason about susceptibility, rate of jamming, 
and impact on persistent values.

system administrators to change or add key management modules more

The NRL Protocol Analyzer is a tool for proving security properties
of cryptographic protocols, and for finding flaws if they exist.
It is used by having the user first prove a number of lemmas stating
that infinite classes of states are unreachable, and then performing
an exhaustive search on the remaining state space.  One main source 
of difficulty in using the tool is in generating the lemmas that are to 
be proved.  In this paper we show how we have made the task easier

<blockquote>
As computer systems become more open and interconnected, the need for
reliable and secure communication also increases. In this report, we
discuss a communication device, the NRL Pump, and introduce an
implementation of the Pump: the Event Driven Pump that balances the
requirements of reliability and security.  The Pump provides
acknowledgments (Acks) to the message source to insure reliability.
These Acks are also used for flow control to inhibit the Pump's buffer
from becoming or staying full. This is desirable because once the
buffer is filled there exists a huge covert communication channel.
<p>
We have prepared this report for system designers and programmers who
want to understand the basic structure of the event-driven Pump.  We also
hope this report is helpful to the people who will maintain the
Pump code.  In this report, we assume that the reader is familiar with
the material presented in previous Pump papers.

Past experience in system security certification indicates the need

through the implementation and verification of a small but
non-trivial, security-relevant example, an RS-232 character repeater.
By addressing many of the important issues in system design, we expect
that this example will provide a model for developing assurance
arguments for full-scale composite systems with corresponding gains in
the expediency of the system certification process.

The assurance argument that a trusted system satisfies its information
security requirements must be convincing, because the argument
supports the accreditation decision to allow the computer to process
classified information in an operational environment.  Assurance is
achieved through understanding, but some evidence that supports the

describes a novel application of a technique, called literate
programming, that significantly improves the readability of the
assurance argument while maintaining its consistency with formal
specifications that are input to specification and verification
systems.  We describe an application of this technique to a simple
example and discuss the lessons learned from this effort.

of the Timed Z-channel, " Proceedings of the IEEE Symposium on Security

<a href="1996greenwald-oakland.ps">PostScript</a>
<blockquote>
Our timed Z-channel (a general case of the Z-channel) appears as
the basis for a large class of covert channels.  Golomb analyzed the
Z-channel, a memoryless channel with two input symbols and two
output symbols, where one of the input symbols is transmitted with
noise while the other is transmitted without noise, and the output
symbol transmission times are equal.  We introduce the timed
Z-channel, where the output symbol transmission times are different.
Specifically, we show how the timed Z-channel applies to two examples
of covert timing channel scenarios: a CPU scheduler, and a token ring
network.  We then give a detailed analysis of our timed Z-channel.  We
report a new result expressing the capacity of the timed Z-channel as
the log of the root of a trinomial equation.  This changes the capacity
calculation from an optimization problem into a simpler algebraic
problem and illustrates the relationship between the noise and time
factors.  Further, it generalizes Shannon's work on noiseless channels
for this special case.  We also report a new result bounding the timed
Z-channel's capacity from below.  Finally, we show how an interesting
observation that Golomb reported for the Z-channel also holds for the
timed Z-channel.

<blockquote>
Using traffic analysis, it is possible to infer who is talking to whom
over a public network.  This paper describes a flexible communications
infrastructure, Onion Routing, which is resistant to traffic
analysis.  Onion routing lives just beneath the applications layer,
and is designed to interface with a wide variety of unmodified
Internet services by means of proxies.  Onion routing has been
implemented on Sun Solaris 2.4; in addition proxies for World Wide Web
browsing (HTTP), remote logins (RLOGIN), e-mail (SMTP), and file
transfers (FTP) have been implemented.
<p>
Onion routing provides applications independent, real-time, and
bi-directional anonymous connections that are resistant to both
eavesdropping and traffic analysis.  Applications making use of onion
routing's anonymous connections may (and usually should) identify
their users over the anonymous connection.  User anonymity may be
layered on top of the anonymous connections by removing identifying
information from the data stream.  Our goal here is anonymous
connections, not anonymous communication.  The use of a packet
switched public network should not automatically reveal who is talking
to whom.  This is the traffic analysis that onion routing complicates.

<blockquote>
Recent papers have taken a new look at cryptographic protocols
from the perspective of proposing design principles. For years
the main approach to cryptographic protocols has been logical,
and a number of papers have examined the limitations of those logics.
This paper takes a similar cautionary look at the design principal
approach. Limitations and exceptions are offered on some of
the previously given basic design principals. The focus is primarily
on public key protocols, especially on the order of signature
and encryption. But, other principles are discussed as well.
Apparently secure protocols that fail to meet principles are presented.
Also presented are new attacks on protocols as well as previously
claimed attacks which are not.

<a href="1997archer-HART97.ps">PostScript</a>
<blockquote>
Verifying properties of hybrid systems can be highly complex.  To reduce 
the effort required to produce a correct proof, the use of mechanical 
verification techniques is promising.  Recently, we extended a mechanical 
verification system, originally developed to reason about deterministic 
real-time automata, to verify properties of hybrid systems.  To evaluate 
our approach, we applied our extended proof system to a solution, based 
on the Lynch-Vaandrager timed automata model, of the Steam Boiler 
Controller problem, a hybrid systems benchmark.  This paper reviews our 
mechanical verification system, which builds on SRI's Prototype Verification 
System (PVS), and describes the features we added to handle hybrid systems.  
 It also discusses some errors we detected in applying our system to the 
benchmark problem. We conclude with a summary of insights we acquired in 
using our system to specify and verify hybrid systems.

<TITLE> Letter from the Editor</Title>
Dear Readers,
<p>
Holiday greetings to CIPHER readers everywhere, (and especially to
CIPHER writers), and best wishes for a happy and healthy New Year.
<p>
The Clinton administration's new crypto export regulations (see new
reports section below, if you want to read them) drew fire from various
quarters, including an editorial in the New York Times condemning them
as "unworkable and trampling on privacy rights." The Council of
European Informatics Societies (CEPIS), an umbrella organization for
several European professional informatics societies, including BCS in
the UK and GI and ITG/VDE in Germany, issued a genearl policy statement
on the use of cryptography prior to the appearance of the latest
regulations (see below).
<p>
Of the three proposed World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)
treaties, two passed in a somewhat modified form; the third and most
controversial, which could have considerably restricted use of
databases, did not.  It appears that the treaties as signed will not
make the temporary electronic copies of documents or other materials
created for browsing purposes a copyright violation, but much more will
probably be written on this topic in the coming months.  Presumably it
will be up to the various nations to decide whether to ratify the
treaties agreed in Geneva.
<p>
An interesting survey of the attitudes of Internet users on various
topics, including concerns about data privacy, can be found at
<a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/gvu/user_surveys/survey-10-1996/">
http://www.cc.gatech.edu/gvu/user_surveys/survey-10-1996/</a>. This is
Georgia Tech's Graphics, Visualization, and Usability Center.
<p>
If you lock your keys in your new OnStar-equipped Cadillac, you can
call a special number and the OnStar service can unlock your car
remotely.  But who else could?

<TITLE>LISTWATCH: Security List Items</TITLE>
<H2>News Items from Security-Related Mailing Lists</H2>
by Mary Ellen Zurko, Open Group Research Institute (zurko@osf.org)
<p>
This issue's highlights are from cryptography, e$pam, tbtf, and dcsb.
<p>
Federal judge Marilyn Hall Patel ruled (12/18) that
government restrictions on the export of computer encryption programs
are an unconstitutional interference with freedom of speech. The case
was brought by Illinois professor of mathematics, Daniel Bernstein, 
who had been told that programs and academic papers required licenses
to communicate abroad.
<p>
A personal computer with several hundred thousand credit card accounts
stored in it was stolen from a Visa office.
<p>
The classic man-in-the-middle attack is being repackaged as "Web
spoofing" by the Princeton team. Their report on how an attacker can
imitate a Web site to a user, and a user to a Web site, is at
<a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/sip/pub/spoofing.html">
http://www.cs.princeton.edu/sip/pub/spoofing.html</a>.
<p>
A group of Social Security Administration employees was arrested for
passing confidential information on at least 1,000 people to credit
card theives, for bribes of as little as $10.  The theives were able
to activate credit cards stolen from the mail with the holder's
mother's maiden name. This report caused comment on how safe escrowed
keys might be, and how much it might take to steal them.
<p>
There was a lot of discussion of HP's crypto framework announcement
(<a href="http://www.hp.com/go/icf"> http://www.hp.com/go/icf</a>), 
mostly because there was a lot of
confusion about just what it is, what it's meant to accomplish, and
what it means to the recent key escrow initiatives. It is designed to
be flexible enough to support any governmental encryption policy. A
hardware or software token activates the encryption support. They're
using Microsoft's CAPI and Intel will build some hardware for it.
<p>
Germany passed a Cyberspace law that, amoung other things, will outlaw
cookies. Cookies are used both to maintain session state in the
stateless HTTP protocol and to track user's movements on the Web.
<p>
RSA Laboratories are inviting comments and for their next generation
of the Public-Key Cryptography Standards. The current generation is
available at <a href="http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/pubs/PKCS/">
http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/pubs/PKCS/</a>. Suggestions should
be sent either to the pkcs-tng@rsa.com mailing list (subscribe by
sending email with "subscribe pkcs-tng" in the message body to
majordomo@rsa.com) or to pkcs-editor@rsa.com, whichever is deemed more
appropriate.
<p>
Ross Anderson and Markus Kuhn put out a report on how they cracked
a smart card with a small amount of equipment and some hacking. They
built equipment to send bad data to the card and observe the results. 
<p>
There are rumors that Digicash is going to hire a new CEO, and Chaum
will become chief technology officer.

<TITLE>Annual Computer Security Applications Conference '96 Report
</TITLE>
<H2>Report on the 1996 Annual Computer Security Applications Conference 
(ACSAC)<br> by Jeremy Epstein
</H2><br>
<i>[Editor's note: Jeremy could not attend all of the sessions, so he
cautions that these notes are incomplete -- in particular, none of 
the sessions after early afternoon on Thursday are covered. If you would
like to make it more complete by sending me a note, please do, and I
will update the Web version of this report. CEL]</i>
<p>
The 12th Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC) was 
held December 8-13 in San Diego CA.  While the organizers put together 
an excellent conference, the weather was cold and rainy - exactly what 
most of us were hoping to escape!  The first two days of the 
conference were devoted to tutorials, which I did not attend.
<p>
The keynote speech by David Keyes of the FBI described the 
Presidential Commission on Critical Information Infrastructure, its 
structure and goals. The commission (whose Web page www.pccip.gov 
should be operational by the end of the year) is chartered with making 
recommendations on protecting the national infrastructure and setting 
up an organization to carry out those recommendations. Most commission 
members (half of whom will be from private industry) have not yet been 
appointed, so real work has not yet started. A pointed questioner 
asked what would be accomplished by this commission other than a 
report, since others (e.g., "Computers at Risk") have already pointed 
out the problem, and there's been no action.  Mr. Keyes said that this 
time there's a plan to get up an implementation organization, which 
will mean that the recommendations won't simply go on the shelf.
<p>
The distinguished lecturer was Dr. Roger Schell of Novell, whose talk 
was titled "The Internet Rules but the Emperor Has No Clothes".  Dr. 
Schell is one of the earliest members of the security community, and is 
widely credited as "father of the Orange Book". Dr. Schell's thesis 
refers to the fairy tale "The Emperor's New Clothes", in which highly 
paid tailors accept large sums of money to create imaginary clothes, 
and everyone but a small child is afraid to tell the emperor. In that 
vein, Dr. Schell suggested that many of our solutions are elegant 
clothes for a naked emperor.  He noted that while the problems change, 
the underlying security requirements do not, and high assurance 
systems are more necessary today than ever.  Making users 
responsible for their own security assessments is akin to having them 
"performing their own brain surgery", Dr. Schell asserted.  Third party 
assessments (such as those performed by the NCSC) are more valuable 
than ever.  Dr. Schell pointed out that the "penetrate and patch" 
model of security didn't work in the past and still doesn't work 
today.  Many recent innovations are dangerous;  he called Java an 
"automatic malicious software distribution mechanism."  Dr. Schell 
proposes that high assurance MLS is exactly what companies need to 
protect themselves from the Internet. He also criticized the Common 
Criteria (CC), which confuses the security field by providing 
unlimited numbers of incomparable security targets so users cannot 
compare products.  Finally, he suggested that the CC has more than 
made up for the terseness of the TCSEC.  In total, a thought provoking 
and provocative lecture.
<p>
The main body of the conference had two tracks.  On Wednesday, both 
tracks were refereed papers and panels.  On Thursday and Friday there 
was one refereed paper/panel track and a vendor presentations track.

<H3>Track A, late Wednesday morning</H3>
<p>
The "Security Engineering" session was chaired by Jody Heany of 
MITRE.
<p>
Andreas Sterbenz of the University of Graz (Austria) described the 
Java security model.  His concern was not with bugs in implementation, 
but rather with the overall design.  He proposed a four layer model 
with the language, virtual machine, runtime library, and runtime 
environment. Flaws in each of the layers can result in security 
violations, as the overall security architecture is quite fragile.  In 
response to a question, he said that Microsoft's ActiveX uses signed 
applications, but he had no other information.  He also said that the 
new version of Java due out in the spring adds digital signatures for 
applets, but doesn't solve the underlying weaknesses.  An audience 
member added that Sun recently posted a Java security model on their 
Web page.

The second paper in the session was "Implementing Security policy in a 
Large Defence Procurement" presented by Michael Nash of Gamma Secure 
Systems.  He described the design and implementation of a very large 
integrated system for the Royal Air Force supplies and engineering.  
The system will have 35,000 users at 100 sites at a cost of about 
US$750M.  Most information is either unclassified or restricted (less 
classified than U.S. Confidential).  A small amount of information is 
Secret, and the system was design to process and protect both 
classified and unclassified data.  After designing the system, they 
determined that very few users needed access to the classified data 
and that the classified data was static.  As a result, they put the 
classified data on CDROMs and provide standalone machines to access it 
in those few locations where it is needed, rather than dealing with 
MLS problems.

The final paper in the session, "An Authenticated Camera" was 
presented by Chris Hall from Counterpane Systems.  The camera in 
question is a design but has not been built.  It provides a digital 
signature of each picture including a hash of the image, the time and 
date, and the identity of the user taking the picture.  Using a method 
similar to cipher block chaining prevents playback of images while 
omitting one or more from the sequence.  They wanted a guarantee of 
location (so it would prove where the picture was taken), but this was 
impossible because GPS data isn't trusted (i.e., signed so as to 
prevent forgery).  The camera cannot guarantee that what is in the 
picture is real (i.e., that the image is of an actual scene rather 
than of a prop).  The design assumes that the camera can be protected 
from tampering.  Other considerations are use of an accurate clock and 
feasible methods of authenticating to the camera (such as using a 
thumbprint).
<H3>
Track A, early Wednesday afternoon</H3>
<p>
The "Secure Links" session was chaired by Ravi Sandhu.
<p>
Myong Kang of NRL presented the first paper, titled "A Case Study of 
Two NRL Pump Prototypes".  The NRL pump is a secure one-way device 
that allows for information flow from low to high while maintaining 
performance and minimizing covert channels. Two versions of the pump 
were built: the E-pump (an event-driven pump) which is an application 
layer pump implemented as trusted software running on a Wang XTS-300, 
and the D-pump (a network pump) which was built on DOS as a transport 
layer pump.  The focus of the talk was on comparing the two versions.  
The E-pump won't lose messages because it waits until the high 
application acknowledges receipt before discarding it, while the 
D-pump (because it operates at the transport layer) can only wait for 
acknowledgment by the receiving system.  The D-pump performed better 
than the E-pump, since it was running on a system with much lower 
overhead.  The authors concluded that the applications layer (not the 
transport layer) is the right place to build the pump, but that a more 
efficient high-assurance system is needed for the pump to be practical.
<p>
The second paper in the session was "Asymmetric Isolation" presented 
by John Davidson of Norex.  Like the pump, this idea is a secure 
on-way device.  Unlike the pump, there are no acknowledgments, and 
hence no potential for covert channels.  By using a fiber optic cable, 
they were able to build the low-to-high channel using off the shelf 
parts, and gain a high degree of assurance that no information flows 
from high to low.  Some configuration file manipulation was necessary 
to prevent confusing systems as to how to route packets.  Several 
audience members pointed out that this approach means that the low 
system must self-throttle to avoid overrunning the high system, which 
could lead to the high system losing data.
<p>
The final paper in the session was "Starlight: Interactive Link" by 
Mark Anderson of the Australian Defence Science and Technology 
Organisation (DSTO). This paper, which won the "best paper award", 
described a hardware device and associated software that allow running 
windows of two classifications on an untrusted workstation running 
UNIX and X.  The architecture is a high computer which displays the 
data and runs X applications, a low computer that runs X applications, 
and the Starlight device that connects the two computers.  The 
keyboard and mouse are connected to the Starlight device, and the user 
selects whether the input should be treated as high or low using a 
physical switch (thus routing the input to the appropriate computer). 
A surrogate X server on the low machine allows X clients to run 
unmodified while passing information from low to high; a surrogate X 
client on the high machine allows the real X server at high to run 
unmodified with the low X clients.  The system does not provide 
visible window labels, but a device attached to the monitor provides 
LEDs to indicate whether the user is operating at high or low.
<H3>
Track A, late Thursday morning</H3>
<p>
The "Security Architecture" session was chaired by Emilie Siarkiewicz 
from Rome Laboratory.
<p>
The first paper, "Using Fortezza for Transparent File Encryption" 
presented by Jeremy Epstein of Cordant, described the design of the 
Assure product (a DOS/Windows security add-on) and how they used 
Fortezza to replace DES for transparent file encryption.  Several of 
the Fortezza features that work well for message encryption (such as 
automatic creation of new initialization vectors whenever data is 
encrypted) make transparent file encryption very difficult to 
implement.  The product uses a shadow file structure to hold Fortezza 
encryption keys and initialization vectors, which a questioner pointed 
out is fragile in the case of file system corruption.
<p>
The second paper, "An Extended Capability Architecture to Enforce 
Dynamic Access Control Policies" was not presented.
<p>
The third paper, "SIGMA: Security for Distributed Object 
Interoperability between Trusted and Untrusted Systems" was presented 
by Deborah Shands as neither of the authors was available.  
SIGMA is trying to facilitate MLS operations within the context of
CORBA.  The concept of a "multilevel enclave" introduced in the presentation
drew some questions.  Readers can find details on the project at the TIS 
web site under distributed systems research, at 
http://www.tis.com/docs/research/distributed/sigma.html
<p>
<H3>Track A, early Thursday afternoon</H3>
<p>
The "Firewalls" session was chaired by Jeremy Epstein of Cordant.
<p>
The first paper, "Operation Chain Link: The Deployment of a Firewall 
at Hanscom Air Force Base" was presented by Dan Vukelich (the author, 
Julie Connolly,  was unable to attend due to a blizzard).  The project 
started by surveying what network services were needed, and what the 
network security policy should be, which was termed "socializing the 
project".  Using network monitors, they discovered several services 
that were being used that were not known.  Before installing the 
firewall, it was staged in a lab using actual IP addresses, which 
helped find several problems before the system was turned on.  After 
installation, they discovered several required services that hadn't 
been detected earlier because they were used rarely, and their use had 
not coincided with the monitoring period.  Major concerns include 
ongoing maintenance due to personnel turnover, the presence of 
(unmonitored) communications to other military bases, and the presence 
of modem pools.
<p>
The second paper, "Mandatory Protection for Internet Server Software" 
was presented by Rick Smith of Secure Computing.  Three different 
models of "mandatory" protection are proposed for firewalls: the 
change root (chroot) facility, traditional MAC, and type enforcement.  
Chroot allows creation of restricted portions of a file system that an 
application can run in, but doesn't control access to resources such 
as sockets.  Some of the most popular firewalls, including Raptor, 
Gauntlet, and V-One appear to use chroot.  MAC is much stronger than 
chroot, as it allows segregation of applications within the same 
computer.  Cyberguard (and possibly other firewall products) use MAC 
as their primary protection mechanism.  Type enforcement provides 
strict rules for what applications can do, and is claimed to be 
stronger than MAC.  Secure Computing's Sidewinder is claimed as the 
only firewall using type enforcement.  In response to a question about 
whether the type enforcement databases are difficult to configure 
securely, the author agreed that a head-to-head comparison would be 
useful.  The author concluded by noting that it's depressing to think 
about Windows NT as the future, since it's not built to resist attack 
using mandatory controls.

<H2>Notes on the DIMACS Workshop on Network Threats</H2>
<H3>by Dave Millar, U. of Pennsylvania</H3>
<p>
The DIMACS Workshop on Network Threats was held at The Center
for Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science (DIMACS) in
Piscataway , NJ from December 4-6, 1996.
<p>
The program, with links to abstracts for many of the talks, can be found

<H3>
Peter G. Neumann<br>
A Global Perspective on Network Risks</H3>
<p>
PGN:  Problems include: systems are not designed with full set of
requirements in mind: e.g. mid-sixties East Coast power grid failure;
1980 arpanet outage (4 hours); 1988 Bell AT&T long lines failure.  In
each case the common denominator was that a flaw at one node propagated
across the network.  Need to develop a systems-oriented view to get
there: step one is education.  Has the impression that universities are
not teaching a systems-level view.  PhD in computer science didn't know
what software engineering was.  There is no hope for technical panaceas a
la firewalls, IPv6, etc.  They are just tools.
<p>
Simson Garfinkel:  The only hope is strict liability for vendors and
credible threat of lawsuits for product liability.
<H3>
Catherine Meadows<br>
A Representation of Protocol Attacks for Risk Assessment</H3>
<p>
Problem is that it's difficult to prove quantitative measures of
security.  Attempted to develop non-quantitative techniques to compare
vulnerabilities.  Attacks are broken down into components, developed a
taxonomy of stages.  Successive stages enable following stages resulting
in a "payoff".  Stages are composed of "atomic actions".  Created a
graphical shorthand to document attacks.
<H3>
Yvo Desmedt<br>
Network Security Threats in General
</H3><p>
Theory of network reliability says that if u hosts are thought to be
dishonest, and network is 2u+1 vertex connected, receiver can trust the
message if he receives more than u+1 identical messages.
<p>
If hosts authenticate themselves to adjacent hosts with secret key
technology, the above would tell you that receiving u+1 messages would
suffice to authenticate the message.  But if you allow for malicious
hosts that can spoof routes, u+1 identical messages do not suffice.
<p>
However, if hosts authenticate to adjacent hosts with public key, the u+1
result holds.
<H3>
Sarvar Patel<br>
Information Leakage in Encrypted Key Exchange
</H3><p>
Encrypted Key Exchange was developed to protect against off-line
dictionary attacks.  EKE includes random padding to protect against a
class of information leakage that allowed an attacker to eliminate
unlikely passwords and find the password with less than an exhaustive
brute-force attack.  However, the padding method chosen does not make all
numbers equally probable under decryption, giving an attacker information
to eliminate unprofitable dictionary guesses.
<p>
Also proposed a method of transmitting encrypted primes without leakage.
Rather than encrypt the prime directly, choose j between the chosen prime
and the next larger prime.  Encrypt and transmit j.  Then the recipient
decrypts j and picks next smaller number which is prime.
<H3>
Adam Shostack<br>
Apparent Weaknesses in the Security Dynamics Client/Server Protocol
</H3><p>
F2, SecureID's proprietary hash algorithm, has been reverse engineered
and is available on some sites.
<p>
Shostack found a weakness in SecureID protocol that allows an attacker to
authenticate as a SecureID cardholder.  First: SecureID basics:
<p>
Secure ID card displays a new password every minute.  User enters the
time-dependent password and a PIN to a host to authenticate to a host.
The host is running not a normal login, but a modified login that relies
on Security Dynamics' authentication server ("Ace Server") to
authenticate the user.
<p>
Shostack's attack has an intruder sniff a legitimate SecureID
authentication.  Then, with that information, the intruder is able to
spoof an authorization to the host from the Ace Server.  Intruder needs
to know the timestamp on the host and needs to be able to spoof the Ace
server's IP address for the attack to work.  Security Dynamics has fixed
the problem.
<p>
Shostack also mentioned that Security Dynamics' X11 GUI interface for
managing the server may be weak, and sys admins may want to only
administer the system locally with the command line interface.  Also
observed that SecureID does not protect against session hijacking
attacks, for which encryption is needed (and encryption only protects
against attacks between the endpoints - not against active attacks at the
origin or destination hosts).
<p>
RSA/Security Dynamics employee was present and noted that they were in
the process of re-engineering the protocol from the "ground up" and would
be publishing their protocols for public scrutiny.
<p>
Audience member noted that there's also a denial of service attack:
seven bad guesses and the account is suspended.
<H3>
Shi-Kai Chin<br>
Formal Methods Applied to Secure Network Engineering
</H3><p>
Hopes that security may be the killer app that brings formal methods into
wide acceptance for software/systems engineering.  Problem is that other
disciplines have better analytic techniques e.g. electrical engineers
model every circuit as a pole-zero diagram or as the ratio of two
polynomials.  Software engineering needs a comparable discipline.  He's
trying Higher Order Logic.
<p>
Applied Higher Order Logic theorem prover to RFC 1421 - Privacy Enhanced
Mail specification (specifically message integrity).  Intent was not to
test for problems in the underlying encryption algorithms but to test
that the protocol really delivered on its promise of authentic and/or
private messages assuming that the underlying algorithms could be
trusted.  Higher Order Logic "proved" that the intent of the message
integrity function was satisfied (assuming that the hash algorithm did
not permit collisions.)
<p>
Steve Bellovin asked if this approach would have uncovered a problem with
an early implementation of PEM (DES in CBC mode).  Not at this level of
abstraction, but perhaps with a lower level.
<p>
Michael Merrit suggested running the theorem prover against the boneyard
of authentication protocols with known problems to see if a.) the known
problems could be found, and b.) if new, unknown problems could be turned up.

<H3>
Jean-Jacques Quisquater<br>
Overview and Security Analysis of RSA-type Cryptosystems Against Various
Attacks</H3>
<p>
Presented implications of five attacks against RSA and three other
RSA-type cryptosystems (LUC, KMOV, Demytko)
<p>
RSA with low exponents (e<= 33) is vulnerable if attacker can get 1327
messages (for 1024 bit key) (Hastad attack.)   1024-bit RSA with secret
key less than 2exp256 is vulnerable to Wiener attack.
<p>
"Garbage Man in the Middle" will crack RSA key with one message: Alice
encrypts message m to give ciphertext c & sends c to Bob.  Mallory blocks
the message so Bob doesn't see it.  Mallory intercepts the message and
transforms ciphertext c into c'.  Then sends c' on its way to Bob, who
decrypts c' into gibberish message m'.  Bob throws out message m' in his
garbage.  Mallory retrieves m' from Bob's garbage and using ciphertext
derives Bob's key.  (This doesn't have to be an active attack, does it?
As long as Mallory can trick Bob into decrypting gibberish and not
disposing of it properly, Bob's in trouble without any help from Alice,
right?)

Michael Merritt suggested that the results be summarized into concrete
recommendations for sizes of exponent, frequency of key change, key size,

Spoofing Attacks on the Web
</H3><p>
Not talking about DNS or IP spoofing - that's a well-known problem.
Talking about fooling users into making security-relevant decisions -  by
fabricating for them a contrived, deceptive context.  This is not a
protocol attack.  It's more of a social engineering attack, but with a
technical spin.
<p>
Most trivial form of spoofing:  Pop up a dialogue box asking for a
password/credit card number.  Make it look like a real dialogue box.
<p>
More sophisticated attack:  Pop up a dialogue box just when a user is
expecting it from a legitimate source.  E.G. run a hidden javascript on
the user's machine waiting for him to go to a site to download software.
When he goes to the site, pop up a dialogue box asking him if he wants to
download something.  If you choose the name right, chances are user might
choose to accept it.
<p>
Next level of attack is mirroring a site:  make a copy of a sensitive
site on the attacker's web server.  Maybe collect passwords, if the user
is accustomed to entering passwords into the site.
<p>
Next level up is "whole-web mirroring"  Kind of a "twisted, evil twin" of
the web.  Rely on the look and feel of the real web to make the user
believe s/he is seeing the real web.
<p>
This is a powerful attack:  It handles forms, cgi scripts, can mirror
search engines, handles almost all types of content.  Gets nasty with
bookmarks since problem will persist across sessions unless the user
looks in the bookmark file and notices the real address.  SSL doesn't
help:  attacker can still spoof a blue key.  (Seems to me user could
check the certificate, no? but who checks certificates)
<p>
How to combat mirroring:<br>
1.  Have *servers* authenticate *clients*.  Use SSL (assuming SSL key
exchange really prevents man-in-the middle attack).
<p>
2.  Provide obvious unspoofable context - i.e. if virtually all web pages
were signed and displayed on the window border (this is probably a long
way off).
<p>
Once user is aware of this problem, its easy to trace, but attackers will
probably use throw-away hacked sites.  Also - trouble is most people
aren't suspicious and may not notice for a while if ever.
<H3>
Drew Dean<br>
Web Security: High Level Overview</H3>
<p>
Digitally-signed applets help some, but:a<br>
-Signed code can still attack you & you don't know it.<br>
-The fact that 100,000 people have used the signed code without incident
is not necessarily proof that the code is safe: it could be that the code
is targeted somehow (e.g. in time or in address-space).<br>
-Still relies on a digital certificate infrastructure which still does
not exist.
<p>
In spite of this, digitally signed code may help organizations achieve a
measure of security in running internally developed code where there is
some good way of distributing the organization's certificate (along with
the browser, say) and where there is an additional basis for trust apart
from technical.
<p>
"Servlets" are coming: client uploads executable to the server.  Database
searches and agents will use this approach very likely.  Should raise
some interesting security problems.

<H3>
Avi Rubin<br>
Blocking Java Applets at the Firewall
</H3>
<p>
Rubin's first remark:  Should have been titled "Blocking Java Applets at
the Firewall - Not"
<p>
Why try to block applets?  protect against malicious code, denial of
service, high-level spoofing (trojan horses, e-mail/smtp/sendmail abuse),
covert channels, undermining firewalls)
<p>
There are several strategies to block a java applet in an application
gateway:  prevent all GETS on "*.class", prevent any gets on applet
tags, don't allow in anything starting with "cafe babe" (first few bytes
of every java applet?).
<p>
However - every strategy can be bypassed:<br>
-Express "applet" as "%41pplet"<br>
-Applet might come in as compressed MIME type.  Firewall would be unable
to uncompress.
<p>
When contacted vendors who claimed that they blocked applets, every one
answered either:<br>
-"It's proprietary" or<br>
-"We use *.class, cafe babe and [applet tags]."<br>  
When weaknesses were described they said "Oh - that's interesting."
<p>
Considered giving up on firewall and giving users a custom  browser which
will only run digitally-signed applets, but two problems:  who will
distribute all the software, and how do you stop someone from installing
their own browser?  (Answer - force all external web access through an
internal web proxy server)  ((But someone in the audience thought the
anonymizer could get around any firewall attempts to implement this.)
<p>
Conclusion:  even if firewalls could block applets, it seems like there
will likely be problems when you try to merge the two policies:<br>
Firewall says trust insiders, control outsiders capabilities through the
firewall<br>
Java says trust no one; control their actions on the platform.
<p>
Audience: why are you so worried about outsiders?  Every study says your
biggest problem is insiders.  Others in audience questioned the studies:
how current are those numbers, are organizations reporting outside
incidents at the same rate they report internal incidents, etc.?

<H3>
Steve Bellovin<br>
Java - Threat or Menace?</H3>
<p>
Problem is:  we want absolute security.  We want "do what I mean"
security.  e.g. when I want to pay for a book over the web, grab my
credit card number out of a file without me having to remember it, but
don't let anyone get at it.
<p>
Problem:  most functions that are needed are the very functions that can
be exploited with bad consequences:  file I/O can be used to read
sensitive files, popup windows can be used to coax me to type passwords.
<p>
Browsers see bytecode - not java source.  Bytecode verifier purports to
enforce rules over java source, but not true:  Bytecode verifier permits
a "goto", e.g. which can not be coded in java.  Bytecode verifier and
class loader are complicated (3500 LOC for BC verifier).  This model is
too complex to be trusted.
<p>
There is nothing like a system call that permits one to know entry and
exit points.  Everything is an "invoke"
<p>
Java relies on DNS for enforcement.  DNS has problems.  In fact DNS has
been used to compromise the model.  DNS queries leak information by going
around the model.
<p>
Denial of service not even considered in security model.
<p>
Digitally-signed certificates are no worse than store-bought software in
theory.  But: doesn't scale on the web.  Also - if software distributors
are not careful about signatures and certificates (i.e. if they're
signing, creating certificates on their web server) there could be
trouble.  Also - unlike store-bought software, the attacker knows the
buyer and can target an attack.  Will people really look at certificates?
<p>
Next best thing:  add local admin tools so that a site can control policy
site-wide (Netscape says they've got it already.)  Eliminate reliance on
the bytecode verifier.
<p>
Dan Wallach explained some of Netscape's plans.  Classes of permissions
are being created (e.g. typical game permissions).  Game will then ask
for game permissions which might be more meaningful to users.
<p>
Drew Dean: bytecode is very hard to verify.  Requires dataflow analysis.
<p>
Bellovin:  Java is probably here to stay.  There are no economic forces to
alter the outcome.
<p>
Not many reports of malicious applets.  Some present had heard of some
reports of problems that might have been caused by applets.
<H3>
Steve Bellovin (standing in for Bill Cheswick)<br>
Stupid Net Tricks</H3>
<p>
When sniffing incidents first got big 2-3 years ago, many ISPs were
sniffed for months because of insecure workstations on the backbone.  Not
widely reported at the time.
<p>
Network 18 was down for several hours: someone broadcast that they
were that network on an ISP.  If you were closer to that ISP's router
than to 18 you got the bogus route.
<H3>
Millicent Watts<br>
Network Security: Where does the real threat lie</H3>
<p>
Review of types of threats, need for vigilance.  Reported on some
failures of voice recognition (failed safe).  Surveillance technology -
Yvo Desmedt noted "Things that think" - technology where more and more
consumer goods/personal articles have chips in them.  E.G.  your
shoes trigger elevator doors and such, but can be
used for more nefarious purposes.  (Anyone know if Italian shoemaker Bruno
Magli is using them yet?)
<H3>
Cindy Cullen<br>
Demonstration of Hacker Techniques</H3>
<p>
Demonstrated rootkit which replaces key unix binaries with ones which
hide intruder's presence.  No longer chosen tool of the elite hackers -
available easily and being modified, sometimes carelessly.
<p>
Also demonsrated ttywatcher.  Run on a host it will display connections
to any tty (in or out).  Encrypted passwords/data are displayed (because
intrusion is at the endpoint), connection can be taken over by root user
with ttywatcher.

<H3>
Alexis Rosen<br>
Understanding and Defending Against SYN Attacks</H3>
<p>
Sorry to say I had to miss this one, though I understand the
recommendations were same as those shared on the security
lists:  trim down the timeout parameter, etc.
<H3>
Robert J. Hall<br>
Channels: Avoiding unwanted electronic mail</H3>
<br>
Another one I hated to miss.  The approach was to add a new sendmail
header which included some cryptographic authentication information.
Different headers, taken together with your email address allow you to
create different personas: one for private discussion with trusted
correspondents, one for "send only" to public mailing lists.  For more
info, the paper is available at:

<TITLE>CEPIS Issues Cryptographic Policy Statement</TITLE>
<H2>CEPIS Issues Cryptographic Policy Statement</H2>
<p>
Cipher received the following statement from Kai Rannenberg, Secretary 
CEPIS LSI Network.
<p>
<H3>CEPIS: 
Governmental Restrictions on Encryption Products Put Security at Risk</H3>
<p>
The Council of European Professional Informatics Societies (CEPIS) -
with nearly 200,000 professionals in its 20 member societies, the
largest European association of professionals working in information
technology (IT) - has agreed on a Cryptography Policy Statement. It
gives an analysis of crypto restriction methods and concludes with the
following recommendations:
<p>
(1) The use of cryptography for identifying data corruption or
authenticating people/organisations should be free of restrictions and
encouraged by governments.
<p>
(2) All individuals and organisations in the private and public sectors
should be able to store and transmit data to others, with
confidentiality protection appropriate for their requirements, and
should have ready access to the technology to achieve this.
<p>
(3) The opportunity for individuals or organisations in the private and
public sectors to benefit from information systems should not be
reduced by incommensurable measures considered necessary for the
enforcement of law.
<p>
(4)  The governments of the world should agree on a policy relating to
their access to other people's computerised data, while seeking the
best technical advice available in the world on:
<p>
(4.1) whether and which access mechanisms to computerised data are an
effective, efficient and adequate way to fight (organised) crime and
mount effective prosecution of criminals, and
<p>
(4.2)   how to implement the policy whilst minimising the security
risks to organisations and individual citizens.
<p>
(Evaluation and implementation of the policy will require regular
review as the technology evolves).
<p>
The full statement is available in the WWW in ASCII and HTML form.
Easiest access is via the web page of the CEPIS "Legal & Security
Issues" Network (CEPIS LSI Network), who prepared the statement:
<a href="http://www.wi.leidenuniv.nl/~verrynst/cepislsi.html">
http://www.wi.leidenuniv.nl/~verrynst/cepislsi.html</a>.
Further there is a press release based on the statement. It can be 
reached via the CEPIS LSI Network web page, too.
<p>

This memo describes a syntax for embedding S-HTTP negotiation parameters in
HTML documents. S-HTTP as described by draft-ietf-wts-shttp-03.txt contains
the concept of negotation headers which reflect the potential receiver of a
message's preferences as to which cryptographic enhancements should be 
applied to the message. This document describes a syntax for binding these 
negotiation parameters to HTML anchors.

confidentiality, integrity, user authentication, and authentication of
servers/services, including proxied or gatewayed services.  Such
services may be provided as extensions to HTTP, or as an encapsulating
security protocol.  Secondary requirements include ease of integration
and support of multiple mechanisms for providing these services.

The Secure HyperText Transfer Protocol</a>, by E. Rescorla and A.
Schiffman.  Revised 2/13/96. 47 pages.<br>
This memo describes a syntax for securing messages sent using
the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which forms the basis for
the World Wide Web.  Secure HTTP (S-HTTP) is an extension of HTTP,
providing independently applicable security services for transaction
confidentiality, authenticity/integrity and non-repudiability of origin.

Security Extensions for HTML</a>, by E. Rescorla and A. Schiffman.
2/13/97. 3 pages.<br>
This memo describes a syntax for embedding S-HTTP negotiation parameters
in HTML documents. S-HTTP as described by draft-ietf-wts-shttp-01.txt
contains the concept of negotation headers which reflect the potential
receiver of a message's preferences as to which cryptographic
enhancements should be applied to the message. This document describes
a syntax for binding these negotiation parameters to HTML anchors.

A Proposed Extension to HTTP : Digest Access Authentication</a>,
by J. Hostetler, J. Franks, P. Hallam-Baker, A. Luotonen, E. Sink, L. Stewart.
Internet Draft, dated 20 December 1995. 
The protocol referred to as "HTTP/1.0" includes specification for a Basic 
Access Authentication scheme.  This scheme is not considered to be a secure
method of user authentication, as the user name and password are passed 
over the network in an unencrypted form.  A specification for a new 
authentication scheme is needed for future versions of the HTTP protocol.  
This document provides specification for such a scheme, referred to as 
"Digest Access Authentication".  The encryption method used is the RSA Data
Security, Inc. MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm.

<TITLE>Reply: Advice for Cipher Conference Reporters</TITLE>
Morrie,
<p>
Thanks very much.  I am always on the lookout for volunteers to write up
significant highlights from relevant conferences.  In fact, some time ago
I wrote up some advice to potential Cipher reporters, and perhaps this
is a good opportunity to broadcast this to our entire readership.  Here
it is:
<H3>Advice for Cipher Conference Reporters</H3>
1.  Thanks very much for contributing.  It takes some work, but
it can be rewarding to you as well as to your readers.  Reporting on a
meeting as a whole forces you to look at it with a somewhat broader
perspective than if you were just listening for the points that
directly affect your own research.
<p>
2.  You are writing for the readers of a NEWSletter.  Think of yourself
as a member of the audience -- if you weren't able to be at the meeting
what would you like t  knmw about it from a friend who attended?  Put
the most important things first and be brief.  Write in the active
voice. See Strunk & White for additional advice on writing style.
Look at past Cipher issues for examples.
<p>
3. Significant technical advances are always of interest.  For most
meetings Cipher covers, however, a proceedings containing all the
technical papers is published, so it isn't usually necessary to cover
those details in depth.  The questions asked after a paper and
un-minuted panel discussions usually deserve more space than a
rehearsal of the papers' abstracts.  It is helpful to note what caught
the interest of the audience (or what didn't, if that's significant).
<p>
4. It's helpful to let readers know how to acquire a copy of the
proceedings -- try to provide a reference; pointers to Web pages are
good if available.
<p>
5. Details of the meeting outside the technical sessions can liven up
the story.  We aren't looking for gossip, but who won the croquet
tournament may be of interest.  Was the attendance up or down from
last year?  What are the plans for next year -- dates, location,
points of contact?
<p>
6. Try to get your copy in as soon as possible.  "News" ceases to
be that when it gets old.  If necessary, I will edit your report and
get it back to you for approval if there are any significant changes
or additions.
<p>
7. Again, thank you!  Without contributions like yours, Cipher could
not continue.

<TITLE> Introduction to Cryptographic Standards</TITLE>
<H2>Introduction to Cryptographic Standards</H2>
by Richard Ankney 
<HR><b>
Financial Industry Security Standards (ANSI X9)</b>
The banking community has traditionally been more concerned about
security than other industries (although this is changing).  Various X9
committees developed a number of notable cryptographic standards during
the 1980s, including:
<ul>
<li>X9.9:  Existing wholesale DES MAC standard
<li>X9.19: Existing retail DES MAC standard
<li>X9.23: Existing wholesale encryption standard
<li>X9.17: Existing, recently updated wholesale DES key management standard
<li>X9.24: Existing retail DES key management standard
</ul>
<p>
Since 1991, X9F has been working primarily on public key standards.
These include the following:
<p>
X9.30 is a three-part standard for irreversible public key algorithms.
Part 1 of the standard is the NIST Digital Signature Algorithm.  Part 2
is the NIST Secure Hash Algorithm.  Part 3 deals with certificate
management for DSA.  Recall a certificate is a structure which binds a
user's name to his/her public key, and is signed by a trusted third
party called the Certification Authority (CA).  CAs may be arranged in
a hierarchy, for scalability.  Certificates may be revoked prior to
expiration and placed on the CA's certificate revocation list (CRL).
Part 3 defines operational controls and procedures for use of
certificates.  Controls are defined for distribution of a CA's public
key, revocation of certificates for various reasons, protection pf
private keys, etc.  The relevant data structures are specified using
ASN.1. All information is contained in an X.509 (public key)
certificate and attribute certificates, which contain additional
information associated with a user.  A new standard, X9.45 (see below)
will define the use of attribute certificates for authorization of
banking transactions.  The standard also specifies formats for multiply
signed certificates and transactions. Appendices deal with trust
models, i.e., what certification authority (CA) do I trust, and how do
I verify a chain of certificates from that CA to a certificate of
interest, and other topics.  Part 3 also defines an extension mechanism
for certificates and CRLs, which is also being adopted by ISO as part
of X.509. The standard defines several CRL extensions, including a
revocation reason (allowing different processing in the event of, say,
a key compromise as opposed to name change) and the ability to
temporarily suspend, rather than revoke, a certificate.  Part 3 is, to
say the least, a fairly major piece of work.  Part 1 of the standard is
awaiting publication.  Part 2 was published in early 1994 (although it
must be updated to address SHA-1, since SHA was found to have a
weakness).  Part 3 is out for X9 ballot, after which there will be a
public comment period prior to publication.
<p>
X9.31 is a three-part standard for reversible public key algorithms.
Part 1 is the RSA signature standard, based on the existing ISO 9796
standard.  It specifies a rather complex padding mechanism which
provides an enormous amount of redundancy to protect against forgery.
Part 2 specifies hash algorithms which may be used with RSA. These
include the usual suspects (MD2, MD5, and SHA) as well as a DES-based
hash proposed by IBM, MDC-2.  Part 3 of X9.31 addresses certificate
management, and is largely identical to Part 3 of X9.30.  Part 1 has
been through all ballots and public comment, and is awaiting resolution
of the Public Key Partners dispute prior to publication.  Due to some
rather questionable procedural maneuvering on the part of some members
of X9 (at least the way this author reads the X9 rules), work on the
other parts has also been shelved for the time being.
<p>
X9.42 is a standard for Diffie-Hellman key agreement.  Besides the
standard Diffie-Hellman exchange, this standard defines a variant which
can be used for store-and-forward applications.  The variant uses the
derived key and other random data provided (in the clear) by either or
both parties as input to a hash function.  The output from the hash
function is used as the key.  The astute reader will note that this
algorithm behaves the same way as the key exchange algorithm used by
the NSA Capstone chip, allowing its use as a drop-in replacement (at
the application or API level).  This standard will likely go to ballot
in the fall of 1995.
<p>
X9.44 is a standard for transport of keys using RSA.  The key(s) being
transferred are concatenated with authentication information (e.g. the
ID of the sender) to form an encryption block. This block is then
masked using the output of a hash function, the seed of which is also
masked and concatenated to the block.  This masking hides any structure
which the block may have had.  The block is then encrypted using an RSA
public key.  This standard is on the shelf until the PKP patent issues
are resolved.
<p>
X9.45 defines enhanced management controls using attribute
certificates.  The digital signature control models put forward thus
far do not contain sufficient security or authorization controls to
offer a high-value non-repudiation service for either wholesale
financial or other large scale commercial applications.  This standard
defines strategies for reducing the risks associated with digital
signature systems.  Much of this builds on the use of public key
certificates and attribute certificates, as defined in X9.30 Part 3 and
X9.31 Part 3. Attribute certificates are used to convey authorizations
and restrictions that inform verifiers when an entity's signature would
be considered valid, i.e., when the signature authorizes a document or
transaction.  These circumstances might include requirements, for
example, that the monetary value be less than or equal to a specified
dollar amount, or that another entity "cosign" the document. This
standard will also define mechanisms for electronic timestamping and
notarization of documents, as well as delegation of authority from one
user to another.
<p>
X9.41 specifies mechanisms to manage security services.  This standard
is basically a protocol to negotiate security attributes between two
entities (e.g., required security services, algorithms, crypto module
requirements). It uses the IEEE 802.10c key management protocol as a
base.  This protocol is used to negotiate a key, which then protects
the actual negotiation.  IEEE 802.10c is described in more detail
below.
<p>
There are also several standards that are new enough to not have numbers
assigned.
<p>
There is a fairly complete draft of a certificate extensions standard.
This is being coordinated with ISO.
<ul>
<li> An entity may, in general, have multiple certificates, stored
     in its directory entry.  To assist in determining which
     certificate is needed to verify a signature, a key identifier
     may appear in the certificate.  The key identifier of the CA
     certificate needed to verify the signature on a (user)
     certificate may also appear in the user certificate.
     Similarly, a certificate may indicate the intended usage of
     the public key (signature, encryption, etc.).

<li> Certificates may be used in environments where multiple
     policies apply.  Thus, a certificate may indicate the policies
     with which it may be used.  Qualifier information may be
     associated with the policy identifier, for use by the
     application.   Additionally, a certificate may be restricted
     to use with particular policies and key usages.

<li> To facilitate use by applications based on other types of
     names than X.500 names, the certificate may contain additional
     name forms (e.g. Internet mail addresses).  Other identifying
     information needed to ensure the identity

<li> The private key used to sign a document may be used over a
     different (much shorter) period than the public key used to
     verify the signature, which may be subject to regulations
     regarding record retention.  A private key validity period may
     be included to the certificate.

<li> There is also a requirement to automate the verification of a
     certification path.  This includes situations where the path
     crosses multiple certificate policy domains.  A path must be
     verifiable without requiring human intervention, and without
     knowledge of specific policies by the verifier.  Policy
     knowledge is required by a CA, when issuing a certificate
     containing a policy identifier, and the verifier must indicate
     a set of acceptable policies, but the verification logic is
     not required to perform any processing beyond byte-by-byte
     comparison of policy identifiers.

<li> There is also a need to constrain the length and structure of
     a certification path.  This includes mechanisms to distinguish
     end user certificates from CA certificates, to limit the
     certification path length, and to restrict the namespace for
     which a CA can certify.

<li> For CRLs, it must be possible to unambiguously detect CRL
     issuance, regardless of the CRL distribution strategy; a CRL
     serial number is defined for this purpose.  It must also be
     possible to constrain the size of CRLs, by partitioning the
     CRL into pieces (e.g. CA vs. user certificates, or by
     revocation reason), or by issuing "delta CRLs" which only
     contain revocations since the last CRL.
</ul>
<p>
Finally, work has just started on a standard proposed by the Federal
Reserve.  This standard is for triple DES, as an alternative to the
single DES algorithm used in, for example, the current X9.23 standard
for message encryption.
<HR><b>
ANSI X12</b>
<p>
X12.58 (version 2) defines EDI security structures.  Security is
implemented using security headers and trailers to encapsulate data at
either of the two levels (individual transaction or functional group)
within an EDI interchange.  Encryption, authentication (MACs) and
assurances (digital signatures) are supported.  Encryption uses
symmetric algorithms, with key management using either symmetric or
public key cryptography to envelope the symmetric key used to encrypt a
transaction.  The standard allows for multiple signatures, which may be
computed over the transaction, previous signatures on the transaction
("countersignatures"), or both.  Signers may include timestamps,
signature purpose, and other information in the signature computation
as well. This standard is currently in ballot.
<HR><b>
IEEE</b>
<p>
IEEE 802.10c specifies a key management protocol for use by lower
layers in the protocol stack.  (The protocol itself runs at the
application layer.)  802.10c is also the basis of ANSI X9.41, and will
also be progressed in ISO.  The protocol consists of two exchanges.
The first establishes a symmetric key (by selecting a manually
established key, using public key techniques, or a key distribution
center), and the second negotiates security attributes appropriate to
the calling protocol or application.  This means, for example, that
X9.41 can merely define an appropriate set of attributes, and use the
key establishment mechanisms defined by IEEE (or they could
alternatively define their own mechanisms).
<HR><b>
DoD</b>
<p>
The Message Security Protocol (MSP) is designed for use in the Defense
Message System (DMS).  It specifies a security "wrapper" for X.400
message contents.  Services include authentication, integrity, and non
repudiation (using DSS signatures), and encryption (using Skipjack, and
the Capstone Key Exchange Algorithm for key management, i.e. deriving
per-recipient keys to encrypt the message encryption key).  MSP is an
excellent example of a secure message encapsulation protocol, although
one could argue it depends too much on the use of public key
algorithms.
<HR><b>
ITU-T</b> (formerly CCITT)
<p>
X.400 (1988) also provides a plethora of security services, but these
are implemented within the message envelope rather than as part of the
message content.  (Recall MSP is effectively part of the message
content, with the real message content embedded inside it.  This means
it can be conveyed over any X.400 (or other) mail transport, regardless
of "vintage".)  Besides the end-to-end services mentioned above, a
variety of services internal to the message transfer service itself are
provided, e.g., authentication between adjacent components, proof of
submission of messages, authentication of delivery reports, proof of
delivery (signed receipts), etc.  X.435 (1991) defines a means to
convey EDI over X.400, and builds additional security services on top
of those defined in X.400.
<HR><b>
ASTM</b>
<p>
E31.20 defines a standard for authentication of health care
information.  The cryptographic portion is basically taken from ANSI
X9.30 Part 3, with particular emphasis on use of multiple signatures
with different purposes (author, transcriptionist, reviewer, etc.).
The standard also specifies requirements for secure user
authentication, and contains some tutorial material on biometric
authentication, trusted timestamping, etc.  This standard is currently
out for the first of what will likely be several ballots, as there is
some movement to attempt to grandfather in existing "closed" (e.g.
mainframe-based) medical record systems.
<HR><b>
Internet RFCs and Drafts</b>
<p>
Most CIPHER readers are probably familiar with RFCs 1421-1424, i.e.
Privacy Enhanced Mail. These standards define a format for securing RFC
822 messages, using digital signatures and encryption.  In many
respects, this is a "7-bit" version of MSP (not surprising, considering
at least one key person worked on both protocols).  RFC 1422 defines a
top-down certification infrastructure, where the world is divided into
multiple "policy domains" (e.g., high assurance, low assurance) based
on the CAs toward the top of the hierarchy.
<p>
Since PEM and MIME were developed in parallel, there was originally
little interaction between the two groups.  Recently, however, draft
RFCs were published specifying the provision of PEM services using
MIME. PEM headers conveying signature and key management information
were effectively placed in separate body parts, rather than as header
lines in front of the actual message.  This seems to be a more elegant
and flexible solution, since it can be extended by simply specifying
new MIME body parts.  Additionally, non-certificate-based key
management is allowed.  For example, public keys can be conveyed (along
with identification information) in the appropriate body part, which is
simply signed by a (hopefully trusted) third party.  This allows
construction of PGP-like key management models in the MOSS (MIME Object
Security Services) framework.
<p>
Other cryptographic mechanisms are being defined for securing HTTP, the
protocol used by the World Wide Web.  The two camps seem to be:  Secure
HTTP, which simply encapsulates HTTP messages inside PEM or PKCS #7
(see below), and the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), which runs below HTTP
(or any other protocol), and above TCP.  SSL secures a client/server
session, by authenticating the server to the client (and optionally
vice versa), and encrypting and MACing data under keys derived during
session establishment.  Time (and the market) will tell which protocol
will survive, although at least one vendor is hedging his bets by
supporting both.
<HR><b>
Cryptographic API Standards</b>
<p>
There is a great deal of interest in the use of cryptographic APIs to
isolate application developers from crypto details.  This interest
comes from standards bodies (particularly X9), vendor consortia
(X/Open), and government agencies (NIST, NSA, etc.). Here's a brief
description of the APIs of interest to X9.  These APIs are at different
"layers of abstraction", and an appropriate one would be selected based
on the cryptographic awareness of the application.
<p>
The Generic Security Services API (GSS-API) is a high-level API which
provides session-oriented security services (confidentiality,
integrity, authentication and non repudiation) between
"crypto-oblivious" applications.  The application MAY select particular
mechanisms (e.g.  Kerberos, or public key authentication) but in
general would use defaults.  The only calls needed are to initiate
secure communications with a partner, "protect" each message being
sent, and terminate the dialog when appropriate.  The first version of
GSS-API is RFC 1508; incremental upgrades are being made, and there is
currently an Internet draft of version 2 of GSS-API.
<p>
The Independent Object Protection (IOP) variant of GSS-API supports
store- and-forward applications, where the sender does not actually
establish a session with the recipient.  Again, a minimal number of
calls are necessary to secure a message. This is currently a draft, and
will likely progress to RFC in April.
<p>
X/Open is developing a Generic Crypto Services API, which provides more
direct access to services like encryption, hashing, signature
computation, and key management algorithms. The API allows for the
establishment of cryptographic contexts, and sharing of contexts
between applications.  This "layer" would be used to implement the
mechanisms used by GSS-API and its IOP variant.  It is hoped that
X/Open will publish this around the end of 1995.  X/Open solicits
contributions from other standards bodies and individuals.
<p>
Cryptoki (PKCS #11) is an abstract token interface API developed by RSA
Data Security.  It is the only API to deal directly with issues of
object management within a token, session establishment with a token,
etc.  A final version of this API is expected in a few weeks, although
it appears it will not be as algorithm-independent as the previous
drafts.
<HR><b>RSADSI Public Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS)</b>
<p>
RSADSI and its licensees have produced a number of other important de
facto standards.
<p>
PKCS #1 (RSA Encryption and Signature) defines padding rules and other
details when using RSA.
<p>
PKCS #3 (Diffie-Hellman) defines ASN.1 structures and algorithmic
details for Diffie-Hellman key agreement.
<p>
PKCS #5 (Password-based Encryption) defines a mechanism to derive a
symmetric key from a "password", using a hash algorithm.
<p>
PKCS #6 (Extended Certificate Syntax) defines a way to extend a
certificate by adding arbitrary attributes to it.  This appears to have
been overtaken by events (i.e. the ISO work in this area results in a
simpler structure).
<p>
PKCS #7 (Cryptographic Message Syntax) defines ASN.1 structures for
signed and/or encrypted messages.  This formed the basis for the ANSI
X9 work on multiply signed structures and the like.  Unfortunately, the
two are not identical.
<p>
PKCS #8 (Private Key Information Syntax) defines ASN.1 structures to
convey private keys (with associated attributes) as cleartext and in
encrypted form.
<p>
PKCS #9 (Selected Attribute Syntaxes) defines attributes for use with
the above standards.
<p>
PKCS #10 (Certificate Request Syntax) defines ASN.1 structures for
requesting the issuance of a certificate.  (Needless to say, this forms
the basis of an equivalent structure in X9.30 Part 3.)
<p>
PKCS #11 (Abstract Token Interface API) was discussed above.

<TITLE> Security- and Privacy-Related Standards</TITLE>
Richard Ankney (Richard.Ankney@emc2-tao.fisc.com) has graciously 
volunteered to initiate our standards coverage.  He has provided the
following outline of some security-related standards, and he plans
to flesh out these listings with descriptive paragraphs
as time permits.  This could be the start of a hypertext
document covering a wide range of security standards.
Other contributors continue to be welcome! --CEL

<TITLE> Data Security Letter Offer to IEEE S&P Members </TITLE>
<H2> Data Security Letter Offer to IEEE S&P Members </H2>
A special subscription rate of $25/year for the Data Security Letter
is now available to IEEE TC members. The DSL is an external, nonpartisan
newsletter published by Trusted Information Systems, Inc. Eleven issues
(usually 16 pages each) per year are published. The DSL welcomes reader
suggestions and contributions and accepts short research abstracts
(about 130 words) for publication on an ongoing basis.  On occasion, the
DSL will be republishing Cipher acticles (with authors' approval), but
such articles will constitute a small portion of DSL content (thus there
will be very little duplication of Cipher material).
<p>
IEEE TC members wishing to take advantage of the special subscription rate
should send the following to sharon@tis.com.  The information can also be
faxed to 301-854-5363 (attention: DSL) or phoned to 301-854-5338.

NOTE: If you are already a paying subscriber to the DSL, for the $25 you
will receive a 2-year renewal; refunds, rebates, etc., on your current
subscription are not available.

If you have any questions about the offer or anything else pertaining
to the DSL, you may contact the editor, Sharon Osuna, via E-Mail to
sharon@tis.com or call her at 301-854-5338.

<TITLE>Information for Subscribers and Contributors</Title>
SUBSCRIPTIONS: Two options: <br>
1. To receive the full ascii CIPHER issues as e-mail, send e-mail to 
    <address>cipher-request@itd.nrl.navy.mil</address>
   (which is NOT automated) with subject line "subscribe".<br>
2.  To receive a short e-mail note announcing when a new issue of CIPHER
    is available for Web browsing or downloading from our ftp server
    send e-mail to 
    <address>cipher-request@itd.nrl.navy.mil</address>
    (which is NOT automated) with subject line "subscribe postcard". <br>
To remove
 yourself from the subscription list, send e-mail to
 <cipher-request@itd.nrl.navy.mil> with subject line "unsubscribe".
 Those with access to hypertext browsers may prefer to read Cipher that
 way.  It can be found 
<a href="http://www.itd.nrl.navy.mil/ITD/5540/ieee/cipher"> here</a>.
<p> 
CONTRIBUTIONS: to <i>cipher@itd.nrl.navy.mil</i> are invited.  Cipher is a 
 NEWSletter, not a bulletin board or forum.  It has a fixed set of
 departments, defined by the Table of Contents.  Please indicate in the
 subject line for which department your contribution is intended.   For
 Calendar entries, please include an e-mail address for the
 point-of-contact. ALL CONTRIBUTIONS CONSIDERED AS PERSONAL COMMENTS;
 USUAL DISCLAIMERS APPLY.  All reuses of Cipher material should respect
 stated copyright notices, and should cite the sources explicitly; as a
 courtesy, publications using Cipher material should obtain permission
 from the contributors.
<p>
BACK ISSUES:
There is an <a href="cipher-archive.html">archive</a> here that includes
each copy distributed so far, in ascii, in files you can download.  There
is also an anonymous FTP server that contains the same files.  To access
the archive via anonymous FTP:<br>
1. ftp www.itd.nrl.navy.mil<br>
2. At prompt for ID, enter "anonymous"<br>
3. At prompt for password, enter your actual, full e-mail address<br>
4. Once you are logged in, change to the Cipher Directory:<br>
   cd pub/cipher<br>
5. Now you can request any of the files containing Cipher issues in ascii.<br>
   Issues are named in the form: EI#N.9506  where N is the number of the
   issue desired and 9506 captures the year and month it first appeared.

INTRODUCTION
<p>
<font size=3>
<font color="#000000">
The Object Management Group (OMG) CORBA specification includes security
protocols and services that are being widely adopted.  Unfortunately, a
full understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the security
aspects of the CORBA standards requires experience with Object Oriented
Technology, Information Technology Security and operational system
planning, development and deployment. OMG is hosting this workshop to
bring together individuals with varying sets of these types of
experience to examine, explain and critique the adopted OMG security
specifications and other similar and related work.
<p>
The workshop approach will be to have individuals with the full range
of OOT, IT Security, and Operational System experience examine and
discuss, in turn, the content and meaning of the CORBA Security
standards, the design issues relevant to realizing the CORBA Security
standards in ORBs, and the design issues relevant to using ORBs meeting
the CORBA Security standards as the foundation for operational systems.

<blockquote>
Verifying properties of hybrid systems can be highly complex.  To reduce 
the effort required to produce a correct proof, the use of mechanical 
verification techniques is promising.  Recently, we extended a mechanical 
verification system, originally developed to reason about deterministic 
real-time automata, to verify properties of hybrid systems.  To evaluate 
our approach, we applied our extended proof system to a solution, based 
on the Lynch-Vaandrager timed automata model, of the Steam Boiler 
Controller problem, a hybrid systems benchmark.  This paper reviews our 
mechanical verification system, which builds on SRI's Prototype Verification 
System (PVS), and describes the features we added to handle hybrid systems.  
 It also discusses some errors we detected in applying our system to the 
benchmark problem. We conclude with a summary of insights we acquired in 
using our system to specify and verify hybrid systems.

Archer, Myla M. and Heitmeyer, Constance L., "TAME: A Specialized
Specification and Verification System for Timed Automata," Presented
in the Work in Progress session at RTSS '96, Washington, D.C., December
4-6, 1996.  
<a href="1996archer-RTSS96.ps">PostScript</a>
<blockquote>
Assuring the correctness of specifications of real-time systems
can involve significant human effort.  The use of  a mechanical theorem 
prover to encode such specifications and to verify their properties
could significantly reduce this effort.  A barrier to routinely encoding 
and mechanically verifying specifications has been the need first to 
master the specification language and logic of a general theorem proving 
system.  Our approach to overcoming this barrier is to provide mechanical
support for producing specifications and verifying proofs, specialized for 
particular mathematical models and proof techniques.  We are currently 
developing a mechanical verification system called TAME (Timed Automata 
Modeling Environment) that provides this specialized support using SRI's
Prototype Verification System (PVS).  Our system is intended to permit 
steps in reasoning similar to those in hand proofs that use model-specific 
techniques.  TAME has recently been used to detect errors in a realistic 
example.

<blockquote>
This paper reports the results of a case study on the feasibility of 
developing and applying mechanical methods, based on the proof system 
PVS, to prove propositions about real-time systems specified in the 
Lynch-Vaandrager timed automata model. In using automated provers
to prove propositions about systems described by a specific mathematical 
model, both the proofs and the proof process can be simplified by exploiting 
the special properties of the mathematical model. This paper presents the 
PVS specification of three theories that underlie the timed automata model, 
a template for specifying timed automata models in PVS and an example of 
its instantiation, and both hand proofs and the corresponding PVS proofs of 
two propositions. It concludes with a discussion of our experience in applying 
PVS to specify and reason about real-time systems modeled as timed automata.

<blockquote>
The widespread availability of the TCP/IP protocols in early
versions of BSD UNIX fostered the current widespread use of those 
protocols in commercial products.  Recently the Internet Engineering
Task Force (IETF) has designed version 6 of the Internet Protocol
(IPv6).  IPv6 has some similarities with IPv4, but it also has
many differences, most notably in address size.  This paper describes
our experience creating a freely distributable implementation of
IPv6 inside 4.4 BSD, with focus on the areas that have changed between
the IPv4 and IPv6 implementations.

Proceedings of the Third ACM Conference on Computer and Communications

<a href="1996goldschlag-ACMccs.ps">PostScript</a>
<blockquote>
DoD system high enclaves are often isolated from systems at other
security levels because the usual connectors (guards) are expensive to
procure, integrate, accredit, and operate, and usually require a human
in the middle to review the data flow, independent of direction.  This
isolation reduces the effectiveness of information systems.  The
secure store and forward devices described in this paper can be used
to solve an important (yet tractable) half of the problem: moving data
from LOW to HIGH without a human in the middle.  These devices were
expressly designed to be easy to accredit.  Security critical function
is both minimized and separated from non-security critical function to
reduce the need for trusted components.  A prototype implementation of
one of these store and forward devices is described as well.

Routing Information," Workshop on Information Hiding, Cambridge, UK,
May 1996.  <a href="1996goldschlag-workshop-UK.ps">PostScript</a>

<blockquote>
This paper describes an architecture, Onion Routing, that limits a
network's vulnerability to traffic analysis.  The architecture
provides anonymous socket connections by means of proxy servers.  It
provides real-time, bi-directional, anonymous communication for any
protocol that can be adapted to use a proxy service.  Specifically,
the architecture provides for bi-directional communication even though
no-one but the initiator's proxy server knows anything but previous
and next hops in the communication chain.  This implies that neither
the respondent nor his proxy server nor any external observer need
know the identity of the initiator or his proxy server.  A prototype
of Onion Routing has been implemented.  This prototype works with HTTP
(World Wide Web) proxies.  In addition, an analogous proxy for TELNET
has been implemented.  Proxies for FTP and SMTP are under development.

computer system, we mean a computer system whose environment includes
both continuous and discrete entities.  As background, the paper

requirements,  called the Four Variable Model, and a related
requirements method, called   SCR (Software Cost Reduction).  The paper
then introduces  a special discrete version of the Four Variable Model,
called the SCR requirements model,  and  suggests how the  SCR model
can be extended to specify and to reason about hybrid systems. Examples
of how the SCR model can be used to specify  a system's timing and
accuracy requirements are given.

ACM Trans. on Software Eng. and Methodology 5, 3, July 1996, 
231-261.  <a href="1996heitmeyer-ACM.ps">PostScript</a>
<blockquote>
This paper describes a formal analysis technique, called
consistency checking, for automatic detection of errors, such as  type
errors, nondeterminism, missing cases, and circular definitions, in
requirements specifications.  The technique is designed to analyze
requirements specifications  expressed in the SCR (Software Cost
Reduction) tabular notation.  As background,  the SCR approach to
specifying requirements is reviewed.  To provide a formal semantics for
the SCR notation and a foundation for consistency checking, a formal
requirements model is introduced; the  model represents a software
system as a finite state automaton, which produces externally visible
outputs in response to changes in monitored environmental quantities.
Results are presented of two experiments which evaluated the utility
and scalability of our technique for consistency checking in a
real-world avionics application.  The role of consistency checking
during the requirements phase of software development is discussed.

As computer systems become more open and interconnected, the need for
reliable and secure communication also increases. The NRL Pump was
introduced to balance the requirements of reliability, congestion
control, fairness, and good performance against those of  threats from
covert channels and denial of service attacks.
<p>
In this paper, we describe two prototype efforts.  One implements the
Pump at the process (top) layer in terms of a 4-layer network reference
model and the other implements the Pump at the transport layer. We then
discuss lessons learned and how these lessons will be used in deciding
upon the final hardware implementation of the Pump.

for MLS Interoperability," IEEE High Assurance Systems Engineering
Workshop, Niagara-on-the-Lake, 1996.  
<a href="1996mkang-HASE96.ps">PostScript</a>
<blockquote>
Distributed object-oriented computing (DOC) is a new computing paradigm that
promotes component-based development, location independence, scalability,
software reuse, etc. Users of multilevel security (MLS) technology want to
take advantage of these new technologies. However,  the process of
incorporating new technologies into MLS products is slower than the
analogous process for non-secure commercial products because MLS products
must go through rigorous evaluation/certification procedures.
<p>
We propose an architectural framework that speeds up the process of
introducing new technologies to MLS users. We examine the drawbacks of
traditional MLS approaches and take a fresh look at the requirements of  MLS
users. We then introduce security-critical components that can enable MLS
solutions and an MLS architectural framework that can accommodate not only
legacy systems but also new technologies, including DOC, without
jeopardizing system security.  Our framework separates security critical
components/functions from the rest of the system because these components
must go through rigorous evaluation/certification processes. This approach
enables the secure use of new technologies for MLS users.

A designer of reliable multi-level secure (MLS) networks must consider
covert channels and denial of service attacks in addition to
traditional network performance measures such as throughput, fairness,
and reliability.  In this paper we show how to extend the NRL data Pump
to a certain MLS network architecture in order to balance the
requirements of congestion control, fairness, good performance, and
reliability against those of minimal threats from covert channels and
denial of service attacks.  We back up our claims with simulation
results.

<a href="1996mcdermott-9CSFW.ps">PostScript</a>
<blockquote>
Storage jamming can degrade real-world activities that share stored 
data. Storage jamming is not prevented by access controls or cryptographic 
techniques. Verification to rule out storage jamming logic is impractical 
for shrink-wrapped software or low-cost custom applications. Detection 
mechanisms do offer more promise. In this paper, we model storage jamming 
and a detection mechanism, using Unity logic. We find that Unity logic, in 
conjunction with some high-level operators, models storage jamming in a 
natural way and allows us to reason about susceptibility, rate of jamming, 
and impact on persistent values.

<blockquote>
The NRL Protocol Analyzer is a tool for proving security properties
of cryptographic protocols, and for finding flaws if they exist.
It is used by having the user first prove a number of lemmas stating
that infinite classes of states are unreachable, and then performing
an exhaustive search on the remaining state space.  One main source 
of difficulty in using the tool is in generating the lemmas that are to 
be proved.  In this paper we show how we have made the task easier
by automating the generation of lemmas involving the use of formal 
languages.

The Event Driven Pump," NRL Memorandum Report 5540-96-7850.  
<a href="1996kang-MR_5540-96-7850.ps">PostScript</a>
<blockquote>
As computer systems become more open and interconnected, the need for
reliable and secure communication also increases. In this report, we
discuss a communication device, the NRL Pump, and introduce an
implementation of the Pump: the Event Driven Pump that balances the
requirements of reliability and security.  The Pump provides
acknowledgments (Acks) to the message source to insure reliability.
These Acks are also used for flow control to inhibit the Pump's buffer
from becoming or staying full. This is desirable because once the
buffer is filled there exists a huge covert communication channel.
<p>
We have prepared this report for system designers and programmers who

<blockquote>
Past experience in system security certification indicates the need
for developers of high assurance systems to coherently integrate the
evidence that their system satisfies its critical requirements.  This
document describes a method based on literate programming techniques
to help developers present the evidence they gather in a manner that
facilitates the certification effort.  We demonstrate this method
through the implementation and verification of a small but
non-trivial, security-relevant example, an RS-232 character repeater.
By addressing many of the important issues in system design, we expect
that this example will provide a model for developing assurance
arguments for full-scale composite systems with corresponding gains in
the expediency of the system certification process.

<blockquote>
The assurance argument that a trusted system satisfies its information
security requirements must be convincing, because the argument
supports the accreditation decision to allow the computer to process
classified information in an operational environment.  Assurance is
achieved through understanding, but some evidence that supports the
assurance argument can be difficult to understand.  This paper
describes a novel application of a technique, called literate
programming, that significantly improves the readability of the
assurance argument while maintaining its consistency with formal
specifications that are input to specification and verification
systems.  We describe an application of this technique to a simple
example and discuss the lessons learned from this effort.

<a href="1996greenwald-oakland.ps">PostScript</a>
<blockquote>
Our timed Z-channel (a general case of the Z-channel) appears as
the basis for a large class of covert channels.  Golomb analyzed the
Z-channel, a memoryless channel with two input symbols and two
output symbols, where one of the input symbols is transmitted with
noise while the other is transmitted without noise, and the output
symbol transmission times are equal.  We introduce the timed
Z-channel, where the output symbol transmission times are different.
Specifically, we show how the timed Z-channel applies to two examples
of covert timing channel scenarios: a CPU scheduler, and a token ring
network.  We then give a detailed analysis of our timed Z-channel.  We
report a new result expressing the capacity of the timed Z-channel as
the log of the root of a trinomial equation.  This changes the capacity
calculation from an optimization problem into a simpler algebraic
problem and illustrates the relationship between the noise and time
factors.  Further, it generalizes Shannon's work on noiseless channels
for this special case.  We also report a new result bounding the timed
Z-channel's capacity from below.  Finally, we show how an interesting
observation that Golomb reported for the Z-channel also holds for the
timed Z-channel.

<blockquote>
Using traffic analysis, it is possible to infer who is talking to whom
over a public network.  This paper describes a flexible communications
infrastructure, Onion Routing, which is resistant to traffic
analysis.  Onion routing lives just beneath the applications layer,
and is designed to interface with a wide variety of unmodified
Internet services by means of proxies.  Onion routing has been
implemented on Sun Solaris 2.4; in addition proxies for World Wide Web
browsing (HTTP), remote logins (RLOGIN), e-mail (SMTP), and file
transfers (FTP) have been implemented.
<p>
Onion routing provides applications independent, real-time, and
bi-directional anonymous connections that are resistant to both
eavesdropping and traffic analysis.  Applications making use of onion
routing's anonymous connections may (and usually should) identify
their users over the anonymous connection.  User anonymity may be
layered on top of the anonymous connections by removing identifying
information from the data stream.  Our goal here is anonymous
connections, not anonymous communication.  The use of a packet
switched public network should not automatically reveal who is talking
to whom.  This is the traffic analysis that onion routing complicates.

Recent papers have taken a new look at cryptographic protocols

the main approach to cryptographic protocols has been logical,

This paper takes a similar cautionary look at the design principal
approach. Limitations and exceptions are offered on some of
the previously given basic design principals. The focus is primarily
on public key protocols, especially on the order of signature
and encryption. But, other principles are discussed as well.
Apparently secure protocols that fail to meet principles are presented.
Also presented are new attacks on protocols as well as previously
claimed attacks which are not.

<blockquote>
Deciding precisely what to build and documenting the results is the
goal of the requirements phase of software development. Experience
shows that requirements are the biggest software engineering problem
for developers of large, complex systems. The purpose of this tutorial
is to help the reader understand why requirements are so difficult to
do well, where the state of the art does and does not address current
development problems, the strengths and weaknesses of different
approaches to requirements, and what help we can expect from ongoing
technical developments.
<p>
Focus of the tutorial is on providing the reader with an understanding
of the underlying issues in requirements analysis and specification. It
describes the different facets of the requirements problem from the
points of view of the many parties involved in system development
including customers, contractors, management, regulators, and
developers. It discusses the goals of the requirements phase and the
problems that can arise in achieving those goals. It describes the
characteristics of a disciplined software engineering process and how
such a process helps address many of the problems in requirements. It
compares a variety of published approaches relative to the goals of a
disciplined process. Finally it examines technical trends, including
recent work at the Naval Research Laboratory, and discusses where
significant advances are likely in the future.

<blockquote>
DoD operates many system high enclaves with limited information flow
between enclaves at different security levels.  Too often, the result
is duplication of operations and inconsistent and untimely data at
different sites, which reduces the effectiveness of DoD decision
support systems.  This paper describes our solution to this problem as
it arises in installations of the Joint Maritime Command Information
System (JMCIS), an integrated C4I system.  Our approach views
databases in more classified enclaves as potential replica sites for
data from less classified enclaves.  Replicated data flows from lower
enclaves to higher ones via one-way connections, yielding a high
assurance MLS (multi-level secure) distributed system.  The one-way
connections are the only trusted components.  This approach is based
on our work on SINTRA (Secure Information Through Replicated
Architecture), and applies generally to any collection of systems each
running a database at system high.  It complements and exploits modern
system design methods, which separate data management from data
processing, and enables effective, low-cost MLS operation within that
paradigm.  In addition to describing current JMCIS installations and
our architectural approach, the paper presents our approach for
justifying a system's security and our use of formal methods to
increase assurance that security requirements are met.

<blockquote>
As computer systems become more open and interconnected, the need for
reliable and secure communication also increases. In this paper, we
introduce a communication device, the Pump, that balances the
requirements of reliability and security. The Pump provides
acknowledgements (ACKs) to the message source to insure reliability.  These
ACKsare also used to regulate the source to prevent the Pump's buffer from
becoming/staying full. This is desirable because once the buffer is filled 
exists a
huge covert communication channel. The Pump controls the input rate
from the source by attempting to slave the input rate to the service rate
through  the randomized ACK back to the source.

An analysis of the covert channel  is also presented.  The purpose of
the covert channel analysis is to provide guidelines for the designer
of the Pump to choose appropriate design parameters (e.g., size of
buffer) dependent upon the analysis presented in this paper and system
requirements.

<blockquote>
In the past, the most likely motive for attacks that modify data would have been
financial gain.  However, changes in technology have made many organizations 
so dependent on information systems that it is now possible to disrupt or
degrade their operations by interfering with their supporting information systems.  
When this disruption is accomplished by unauthorized modification of data we call 
it storage jamming.  Storage jamming is the malicious modification of stored data, 
done for the purpose of degrading or disrupting real-world operations that depend 
on the correctness of the data. We assume the person initiating the malicious modification 
(frequently via a Trojan horse) does not receive any direct benefit, financial or otherwise, 
but rather is motivated by more indirect goals such as improving the competitive position 
of his or her own organization. The main goal of this paper is to define storage jamming.  
We also discuss our work to date on possible defenses against it; in order to make the 
case that there are solutions.  In the next section we discuss the nature of storage jamming 
including possible jamming strategies and vulnerability to jamming. The next two sections 
discuss a variety of anti-jamming techniques.  Some of these candidate techniques are based 
on previous work on security-oriented data integrity but are unsuitable for use against 
jamming attacks. We then discuss a particular kind of anti-jamming mechanism called a 
detection object. The paper ends with a summary and discussion of future work.

        Many scientific approaches for specifying, constructing, and certifying
high assurance systems have been developed, including formal verification and
validation techniques.  Much still needs to be done with respect to individual
critical properties (e.g., safety, security, and timeliness).  Even more needs
to be done with respect to (1) the lack of technology support for applying these techniques to practical, real-word systems, and (2) the lack of a unified
framework for building systems that satisfy several critical properties.  These
problems are of such a difficult nature that they will not be solved by industry or academia without the support of both government funding agencies and government research laboratories.  This paper summarizes the results of a
workshop in which a group of 50 experts from academia, government, and industry

Dependability is that property of a computer system such that reliance can

different ways faults are handled in the dependability paradigm with the way 
they are handled in the current paradigms for secure system design.  We show 
how the current security paradigm is generally restricted to a subset of
the types of approaches used in dependability, largely concentrating on
fault prevention and removal while neglecting fault tolerance and forecast,
and argue that this paradigm is fast becoming obsolete.  We discuss the
implications of extending the security paradigm to cover the full range
of options covered by dependability.  In particular, we develop a rough
outline of a fault model for security and show how it could be applied to

<blockquote>
Integrity is usually considered to be at odds with security in multilevel databases.  Integrity constraints enforce conditions on relations between data,
while security constraints enforce separation between data.  If an integrity constraint is defined over data at different security levels, a direct conflict results.  However, the solution is not to sacrifice the integrity constraint
altogether.  Compromise solutions can often be found that guaranteed some,
although not all, of the desired results of the constraint.  In this paper, we will show that, by dividing the desired goals of integrity into three areas, consistency, correctness, and availablity, one often find solutions to integrity problems that achieve some, if not all, of the goals without sacrificing security.

<blockquote>
Paradoxically, one of the most important -- and at the same time,
probably one of  the least understood --  functions performed by information
integrity protocols is to transfer trust from where it exists to where it is
needed. Initially in any protocol, there are at least two types of trust: trust
that designated participants, or groups of participants, will faithfully execute their assigned function in the protocol and trust in the integrity of the
transfer mechanism(s) integral to the protocol. Consequently, almost all
protocols enforce a set of restrictions as to who may exercise them -- either
spelled out explicitly or left implicit in the protocol specification. In
addition there may be unanticipated or even unacceptable groupings of
participants who can also exercise the protocol as a result of actions taken by
some of the participants reflecting trusts that exist among them. Formal methods are developed to analyze trust as a fundamental dimension in  protocol analysis
and proof.

The External COMSEC Adaptor (ECA) is a device responsible for providing cryptographic protection based on rules that (possibly coarsely) define the sensitivity of that information.

Ensuring that the ECA is worthy of this trust requires defining its critical requirements precisely and constructing a strong argument that its implementation satisfies these requirements.  This paper describes a software engineering methodology that uses formal methods for specifying and verifying the overall function rquirements of the ECA.  The methodology integrates the formal specifications and proofs with structured software documenation to clarify the relationship between the refinement of ECA functionality and the argument that the ECA meets its critical requirements.

<blockquote>
The definition of an "appropriate fashion" comes from the system's security
policy, and from security requirements which are detailed in the descriptive
top-level specification (DTLS).  The detailed information necessary to convince
the evaluators that a system can be trusted to manage sensitive data is provided
in the form of an assurance mapping between the trusted computing base (TCB),
which implements the security related functions, and the security policy,
which defines the secure behavior of those functions.  The job of the developers
is to sell the trustworthiness of the system to the evaluators using these
mappings by making a convincing argument that the TCB correctly enforces the
security policy.  In other words, the developer must convince the evaluators
that the physical machine embodied in the TCB is an accurate simulation of the
true, abstract machine prescribed the security policy.  The abstract machine is
first described in the Security Policy Model.  This chapter identifies the certification goals for the assurance mappings.  Unlike other certification deliverables, the assurance mappings are generated throughout the development life cycle.  They are a collection of documents rather than a single document, and a member of the collection may be part of another certification deliverable, such as the Security Policy Model.  The developer must present the mappings as a coherent whole.  This chapter also describes methods that can be used to hand-examine the code for minimality, because the TCSEC also requires the TCB to be "minimized" in the sense that it contains nothing not required to correctly implement the security-related functions. Proving that this requirement has been met is very difficult to do.

<blockquote>
The security policy model (SPM) is the apex of the assurance argument in the
development of a trustworthy system.  A system is trustworthy if the probability of a catastrophic flaw remaining after testing and review is acceptably low.  In our case the correct behavior is described informally in a security policy.  The SPM presents the constraints of the security policy in a way that can be analyzed formally.  It guides the developer toward a secure design and implementation and helps the developer demonstrate rigorously that the system enforces its security policy.  The SPM describes the system's security-relevant behavior for the user.  Without the SPM, the security-relevant goals of the system are not well-defined for the developer, the user, or the evaluator.  The SPM expresses the definition of security for a trusted system.  In this chapter, we instruct the evaluator in the assessment that an SPM fulfills the purposes identified above.  We identify the structure of an SPM and guide the evaluator in the analysis of the structure.  The SPM is influenced heavily by the critical requirements of the relationships between those entities.  We discuss one way to determine if the appropriate entities and relationships have been modeled and if the critical requirements on those
entities have been satisfied.  We do not try to determine what constitutes a
good definition of security for a trusted system.  References are provided on
this topic.  Much research has been performed already regarding good definitions of security.  We concentrate on the evaluation of the structures in the SPM that support the definition of security.

We set out a logic for reasoning about multilevel security of probabilistic systems.  This logic includes modalities for time, knowledge, and probability.
In earlier work we gave syntactic definitions of multilevel security and showed that their semantic interpretations are equivalent to independently motivated
information-theoretic definitions.  This paper builds on that earlier work in two ways.  First, it substantially recasts the language and model of computation into the more standard Halpern-Tuttle framework for reasoning about
knowledge and probability. Second, it brings together two distinct characterizations of security from that work.  One was equivalent to the information-theoretic security criterion for a system to be free of covert channels but was difficult to prove. The other was a verification condition
that implied the first; it was more easily provable but was too strong.  This paper presents a characterization that is syntactically very similar to our previous verification condition but is proven to be semantically equivalent to the security criterion.  The new characterization also means that our security criterion is expressible in a simpler logic and model.

<blockquote>
We present a methodology to facilitate the design and analysis of secure cryptographic protocols.  We advocate the general approach, and a new avenue for research, of restricting protocol designs to well-defined practices, instead of ever increasing the complexity of protocol security analysis mechanisms to deal with every newly discovered attack and the endless variations in protocol construction.  In particular, we propose a novel notion of a fail-stop protocol, which automatically halts in response to any active attack that interferes with protocol execution, thus reducing protocol security
analysis to that of passive attacks only.  We suggest types of protocols that are fail-stop, outline some proof techniques for them, and use examples to illustrate how the notion of a fail-stop protocol can make protocol design easier and can provide a more solid basis for some available protocol analysis methods.

<blockquote> 
Unlike previous approaches to developing a trusted
database system, the replicated architecture approach provides access
control at a high level of assurance through replication of data and
operations.  We present a model of the SINTRA replicated architecture
trusted database system which shows how the logical (users') view of
the system and its security policy is translated into the physical
structure and operations of the SINTRA system.  We formalize the
intended security policy for replicated architecture and demonstrate
that a high level of assurance can be obtained solely from replication
with virtually no change to the sturcture of the underlying database
systems or the security kernel.

<blockquote>
Relational database systems are based on a powerful abstraction:  the
relational data model with the relational algebra and update
semantics.  If the database design (i. e., the way the data is
organized) satisfies criteria provided by this foundation, users have
assurance that they can retrieve information in a consistent,
predictable way.  Multilevel secure database systems must not only
provide assurance that information is protected based on its
sensitivity, but should be based on a data model as sound and complete
as the conventional relational model.  In this paper, we present a data
model with a relational algebra and update semantics for a multilevel
secure database system whose protection mechanisms are provided by the
replicated architecture.  The approach is to systematically describe
the effects of treating security labels as data and to define
explicitly the semantics of these data labels for relational database
operations.  We also briefly compare the SINTRA data model to earlier
ones from the SeaView project and their derivations.

Current projects to provide MLS computing services rarely seem to

distribution, replication, and interoperation are currently receiving
much attention in the commercial database system sector but have yet to
be applied to the delivery of MLS computing services.  This paper
explains how these concepts might be applied to help deliver MLS
computing services relatively quickly and cheaply, and how they can
ease integration of legacy systems and new technology into future MLS

There are many known approaches for multilevel secure database

security level is being investigated.  This is a report on the behavior

Especially, we compare the performance of the Secure

<blockquote>
There are several proposed approaches for multilevel secure (MLS)
database systems which protect classified information.  The
SINTRA (Secure INformation Through Replicated Architecture)
database system, which is currently being prototyped at the Naval
Research Laboratory, is a multilevel trusted database system based on a
replicated data approach. This approach uses physical separation of
classified data as a protection measure. Each database contains data at
a given security level and replicas of all data at lower security
levels. Project goals include good performance and full database
capability.  For practical reasons (e.g., ease of evaluation, portability) the
SINTRA database system uses as many readily-available commercial
components as possible. In this paper, security constraints and the
rationale for the SINTRA prototype are described.  We also present the
structure and function of each component of the SINTRA prototype: the
global scheduler, the query preprocessor, and the user interface. A
brief description of the SINTRA recovery mechanism is also presented.

The expressiveness of the data model has a significant impact on the

models can lead to a loss of database functionality or the inability to
model some real world phenomena if data models are not kept general and
independent of other considerations.  We also present our positions
with respect to developing MLS data models for MLS database systems
using the object modeling technique (OMT).

<blockquote>
One of the most striking properties of the ``Trusted Computer System
Evaluation Criteria'' and its international successors is that none of
these documents contain any attempt to relate their evaluation levels
to a measure of how much effort must be expended to break into a
system.  As a consequence, it's impossible to evaluate rationally the
marginal benefit of spending the extra money necessary to obtain a
higher rating than a lower one.  One reason for this gap between
evaluation levels and cost of system penetration is the difficulty of
quantifying penetration costs.  In this paper I hope to shed some
light on the questions of what is needed, what we have, and what it
would be useful to have in the future.

<blockquote>
To evaluate the effectiveness of techniques used to build secure
systems some sort of quantitative measure of penetration resistance is
desirable.  However, fuzzy logic is the wrong way to go since a single
fuzzy metric of system security hides the information that was used to
generate the metric and since there is an inherent danger of giving
quantitative fuzzy metrics more credence than they really
deserve. Certainly with respect to confidentiality, and possibly with
respect to integrity and availability as well, information theoretic
approaches, though not perfect, are more suitable.  Money would be
better spent furthering such approaches, rather than developing fuzzy
new ones.

<blockquote>
Communication from a low- to a high-level system without
acknowledgements will be unreliable;  with acknowledgements, it can be
insecure.  We propose to provide quantifiable security, acceptable
reliability, and minimal performance penalties by interposing a device
(called the Pump) to push messages to the high system and provide a
controlled stream of acknowledgements to the low system.<P>

This paper describes how the Pump supports the transmission of messages
upward and limits the capacity of the covert timing channel in the
acknowledgement stream without affecting the average acknowledgement
delay seen by the low system or the message delivery delay seen by the
high system in the absence of actual Trojan horses.  By adding random
delays to the acknowledgment stream when the Pump's message buffer is
full, we show how to further reduce the covert channel capacity even in
the presence of cooperating Trojan horses in both the high and low
systems.  We also discuss engineering tradeoffs relevant to practical
use of the Pump.

An organized record of actual flaws can be useful to designers,

a taxonomy for computer program security flaws together with an
appendix that carefully documents 50 actual security flaws.  These
flaws have all been described previously in the open literature, but in
widely separated places.  For those new to the field of computer
security, they provide a good introduction to the characteristics of
security flaws and how they can arise.  Because these flaws were not
randomly selected from a valid statistical sample of such flaws, we
make no strong claims concerning the likely distribution of actual
security flaws within the taxonomy.   However, this method of organizing
security flaw data can help those who have custody of more
representative samples to organize them and to focus their efforts to
remove and, eventually, to prevent the introduction of security flaws.

The most critical problem with associated with implementing replicated

concurrency control, mutual consistency of replicas, and atomic recovery from

five have acceptable performance and, over a wide range of circumstances,
can be chosen based on structural considerations rather than performance.

<blockquote>
Accreditors want to know what vulnerabilities will exist if they decide
to turn on a system.  TCSEC evaluations address products, not systems.
Not only the hardware and software of a system are of concern;  the
accreditor needs to view the system components in relation to the
environment in which they operate and in relation to the system's
mission.  This paper proposes an informal but comprehensive approach
that can provide the accreditor with the necessary information.  First,
we discuss the identification of assumptions and assertions that
reflect system INFOSEC requirements.  Second, we propose the definition
of an assurance strategy to integrate security engineering and system
engineering.  The assurance strategy initially documents the set of
assumptions and assertions derived from the requirements  It is
elaborated and refined throughout the development, yielding the
assurance argument, delivered with the system, which provides the
primary technical basis for the certification decision. With the
assurance strategy in place, certification of the trusted system can
become an audit of the development process.

<blockquote>
In [BAN89] Burrows, Abadi, and Needham presented a
logic (BAN) for analyzing cryptographic protocols in terms of belief.
This logic is quite useful in uncovering flaws in protocols; however, it
also has produced confusion and controversy. Much of the
confusion was cleared up when Abadi and Tuttle provided a semantics
for a version of that logic (AT) in [AT91].<P>

In this paper we present a protocol to show that both BAN and AT are
not expressive enough to capture all of the kinds of flaws that appear to
be within their scope. We then present a logic that adds temporal
formalisms to AT and that is rich enough to reveal the flaws in the
presented protocol; nonetheless, this logic is sound with respect
to the same semantics that was given in [AT91]. Finally, we argue
that any approach of this type is inadequate by itself to demonstrate
the absence of such flaws. We must
supplement the formal logic with semantic analysis techniques.

<blockquote>
In [KSL92], Kehne et al. present a protocol (KSL) for key distribution.
Their protocol allows for repeated authentication 
by means of a ticket. They also give a proof in BAN logic [BAN89]
that the protocol provides the principals with a reasonable degree of
trust in the authentication and key distribution. They present an optimality
result that their protocol contains a minimal number of messages.
Nonetheless, in [NS93] Neuman and Stubblebine present a
protocol (NS) as an explicit alternative to KSL that requires one less
message in the initial authentication and key distribution.
One goal of this paper is to examine some of the reasons for this discrepancy.
Another goal is to demonstrate possible attacks on NS.
Like any attacks on cryptographic protocols, these
depend on assumptions about implementation
details. But, when possible they are serious: a penetrator
can initiate the protocol, masquerade as another principal,
obtain the session key, and even generate the session key herself.
We will set out implementation assumptions required for the attacks to
take place and implementation assumptions that preclude such an attack. 
We will also look at other protocols, including one that is not subject
to this form of attack and has the same number of messages as NS.
Finally, we will briefly discuss the logical analysis of these repeat 
authentication protocols.

of simple sets of requirements in that language. We look at
two versions of a protocol that might meet those requirements and
show how to specify them in the language of the NRL Protocol Analyzer.
We also show how to map one of our sets of formal requirements
to the language of the NRL Protocol Analyzer and
use the Analyzer to show that one version of the protocol meets
those requirements. In other words, we use the Analyzer as a
model checker to assess the validity of the formulae that
make up the requirements.

<blockquote>
Replicated architecture has been proposed as a way to obtain acceptable
performance in a multilevel secure database system.  This architecture
contains a separate database for each security level such that each
contains replicated data from lower security classes. The consistency
of the values of replicated data items must be maintained without
unnecessarily interfering with concurrency of database operations. This
paper provides a protocol to do this that is secure, since it is free
of covert channels, and also ensures one-copy serializability of
executing transactions. The protocol can be implemented with untrusted
processes for both concurrency and recovery.

<blockquote>
A user of a database management system has an intuitive idea of a
transaction as a sequence of database commands that he or she submits.
The user expects this sequence of commands to be executed in the order
of submission, without interference from other database commands
submitted by other users. Techniques for doing this while concurrently
supporting multiple database users are well known for conventional
(i.e., not multilevel) database systems. Most of the transaction
management theory for multilevel secure database systems has been
developed for transactions that act within a single security class. In
this paper, we look at transactions that act across security classes,
that is, the transaction is a multilevel sequence of database commands,
which more closely resemble user expectations. We then give an
algorithm for controlling concurrent execution of these transactions on
a particular multilevel secure database architecture.

<blockquote>
The ECA is an embedded computing device that processes message
traffic for a network that must enforce end-to-end user message
confidentiality.  The ECA uses a commercial, off-the-shelf
cryptographic device to transform sensitive data from the Red Domain
of the network so that it can be transmitted over the untrusted
communications links of the Black Domain.  For transmission purposes,
certain parts of a message, namely the message header, must be
bypassed around the cryptographic device.  The primary critical
requirement for the ECA, "Restricted Red-to-Black Flow" (RRTBF),
requires that the bypassed portion of each message must satisfy
certain format restrictions, and that the rate of bypass must be
constrained.  In this report, we present an informal model of the
ECA's critical requirements together with the assumptions under which
the model was constructed.  We then formalize this model by using the
CSP Trace Model of computation.

The replicated architecture for multilevel secure database systems

algorithm that does not introduce any covert channels. Jajodia and
Kogan have developed one such algorithm that uses update projections
and a write-all replica control algorithm. The new algorithm uses
replicated transactions, and a set of queues organized according to
security class. A new definition of correctness is require for this

Franconia, NH June 1990. IEEE CS Press (Los Alamitos CA, 1990)

<blockquote>
A first order, epistemic logic for representing
and analyzing cryptographic protocols is presented along
with an associated model-theoretic semantics. The formal
language presented has distinct means to represent knowledge of an
individual word, e.g., the ability to recognize or produce a
decryption key, and propositional knowledge. A sample analysis of
a protocol is given.

<blockquote>
Public descriptions of capability-based system designs often do not
clarify the necessary details concerning the propagation of access
rights within the systems.  A casual reader may assume that it is
adequate for capabilities to be passed in accordance with the rules
for data copying.  A system using such a rule cannot enforce either
the military security policy or the Bell and LaPadula rules.  The
paper shows why this problem arises and provides a taxonomy of
capability-based designs.  Within the space of design options defined
by the taxonomy we identify a class of designs that cannot enforce
the Bell-LaPadula rules and two designs that do allow their enforcement.

This report develops a new set of criteria for evaluating computer

Central to these criteria is the concept of a `domain', here
interpreted as a set of information and authorizations for the
manipulation of that information in a computer system.
Architectural requirements are grouped in three categories:
logical structure, the processing of logical structures, and physical 
structure.  These criteria were developed in order to assess the 
utility of Navy standard computers as bases for secure embedded systems,
but they are not specific to those computers.

<blockquote>
Military systems that process classified information must operate in a
secure manner; i.e., they must adequately protect information against
unauthorized disclosure, modification, and withholding.  A goal of current
research in computer security is to facilitate the construction of
"multilevel secure systems," systems that protect information of different
classifications from users with different clearances.  Security models are
used to define the concept of security embodied by a computer system.  A
single model, called the Bell and LaPadula model, has dominated recent efforts
to build secure systems but has deficiencies.  We are developing a new
approach to defining security models based on the idea that a security model
should be derived from a specific application.  To evaluate our approach, we
have formulated a security model for a family of military message systems.
This paper introduces the message system application, describes the problems of
using the Bell-LaPadula model in real applications, and presents our security
model both informally and formally.  Significant aspects of the security 
model are its definition of multi-level objects and its inclusion of
application-dependent security assertions.  Prototypes based on this model
are being developed.

An organized record of actual flaws can be useful to designers,
implementors, and evaluators of computer systems.  This paper provides
a taxonomy for computer program security flaws together with an
appendix that carefully documents 50 actual security flaws.  These
flaws have all been described previously in the open literature, but in
widely separated places.  For those new to the field of computer
security, they provide a good introduction to the characteristics of
security flaws and how they can arise.  Because these flaws were not
randomly selected from a valid statistical sample of such flaws, we
make no strong claims concerning the likely distribution of actual
security flaws within the taxonomy.   However, this method of organizing
security flaw data can help those who have custody of more
representative samples to organize them and to focus their efforts to
remove and, eventually, to prevent the introduction of security flaws.

<h3>EXCERPT FROM THE BOOK PREFACE</h3>
<p>
<font color="#000000">
Real-time computer systems are computer systems which must produce
their results within specified time intervals.  Common examples of
real-time systems include flight control programs, air traffic control
systems, control systems for nuclear power plants, patient monitoring
systems, weapons systems, and military command and control systems.
Real-time systems are having an ever increasing impact on the quality
of human life.   In many cases, human safety depends on their correct
performance.
<p>
Despite the importance of real-time systems, the state of the art for
developing them remains quite primitive.  It is universally
acknowledged that many operational real-time systems lack the necessary
reliability.  Although  still somewhat controversial in the computing
community, there is a growing consensus that the use of "formal
methods", development methods based on some formalism, could have
significant benefits  in developing real-time systems due to the
enhanced rigor these methods bring.
<p>
The objective of this book, which is addressed to the developers of
real-time systems, is to introduce a number of formal approaches that
should prove useful in building industrial-strength real-time systems.
The book should also be helpful to graduate students and others who
seek a comprehensive understanding of how real-time systems can be
developed using formal specification notations and formal analysis
techiques. However, the book is not a general textbook on real-time
systems:  It stresses formal  approaches, omitting other important
topics in the real-time computing literature, such as scheduling and
resource management.
<p>
The book presents some of the most promising and relevant ideas in
formal methods for real-time computing.  In inviting and selecting
prospective contributors, our goal was to provide a fairly complete and
balanced view of the state of the art.  However, such a goal is
impossible to achieve in full.  In fact, the selection process has been
necessarily affected by our personal acquaintances and by the different
responses of the prospective contributors that we contacted.
Nonetheless, we are very satisfied with the quality and thoroughness of
the topics that the book offers its readers.

<h3>ORGANIZATION OF THE CHAPTERS:</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<font color="#000000">
<li> Chapter 1 introduces the topic of formal methods for real-time computing and 
  provides an overview of all of the major approaches (graphical notations, 
  state-machine and logic languages, process algebras, model-theoretic and
  proof-theoretic techniques).  The book contains contributions representing
  each of the major approaches. 
<p>
<li> Chapters 2 through 4 describe approaches based on state machines.  In some
  cases, these are strictly finite state machines, whereas, in other cases, 
  the approach handles infinite state spaces as well.  In all cases, the 
  focus is on how one can use formal analysis to rigorously analyze a 
  real-time system's properties, a major motivation for using formal 
  approaches.
<p>
<li> Chapter 5 introduces the Duration Calculus, a logic-based approach aimed at
  describing real-time sytems and their properties with logic formulas.  In
  this approach, the focus is on the duration of given conditions (e.g., 
  system states).
<p>
<li> Chapter 6 introduces a "dual language approach":  A timed version of Petri
  nets is used to describe the operational behavior of a given real-time
  system, and a logic language is used to specify and to reason about the 
  system properties.
<p>
<li> Chapters 7 and 8 introduce two approaches based on process algebra,
  an algebraic formalism inspired by Milner's Calculus of Communicating
  Systems (CCS) and  Hoare's Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP).
<p>
<li> Chapter 9 introduces symbolic model checking, a practical technique for
  analyzing state machine models, which checks all possible states of the 
  model for violations of a property of interest.
<p>
<li> Finally, Chapter 10 presents a methodology for designing a real-time
  system as a collection of tasks, which  together guarantee some given
  constraints.
</ul>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
Some of the approaches presented  are promising intellectual work,
whereas others have already been applied in industry, although mostly
in an experimental way.  In all cases, however, the presentation  is
tutorial in style and avoids excessive technical detail.  Our objective
is to provide a general, easy to understand introduction to each
approach in the hope of generating the reader's interest.  For  each
approach, many additional references are provided so that interested
readers can delve further into the subject matter.
<p>
To help the reader understand and compare the various approaches, we
suggested (but did not require) that the authors use their approaches
to specify and solve a particular benchmark problem, the Generalized
Railroad Crossing (GRC) problem.  Although it is a "toy" problem, the
different specifications and solutions of the GRC benchmark provide
many insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different formal
approaches for representing and reasoning about real-time systems.  The
GRC formulation, though fairly precise, still permits many different
interpretations.  This is done on purpose, so that the real-life
process of moving from informal to formal notations is better
represented.  Further, this gives authors more freedom to emphasize the
special features of their own approaches.  The GRC problem, or small
variations thereof, is used as an example in most chapters of the book,
including Chapter 1.

 An overview,"</b> <font color="#000000">Constance Heitmeyer (Naval Research Lab) and Dino Mandrioli (Politecnico di Milano)            
<p>
This chapter defines real-time systems and illustrates them with a
number of small examples.  It also discusses issues central to applying
formal methods in the development of real-time systems:  the trade-offs
between operational and descriptive specifications, different levels of
formality that can be applied, and the requirements of formal methods
for building industrial-strength systems.  To put the newer formal
methods into perspective, two methods widely used in practice to design
and analyze real-time systems, namely, structured analysis and
Statecharts, are reviewed.  Several promising new techniques for
specifying and analyzing real-time systems are then summarized and
illustrated with examples.  These include  graphical notations, state
machine and logic-based models,  process algebras,  and analysis
techniques,  such as model checking and deductive reasoning.

"Specification and analysis of real-time systems: Modechart language 
 and toolset,"</b> <font color="#000000">Aloysius Mok, Douglas Stuart (Univ. of Texas), and Farnam Jahanian (Univ. of Michigan)
<p>
This chapter illustrates the use of the Modechart specification language
and the MT toolset by using them in the specification and analysis of the
control rod system of a nuclear reactor.  The specification language and an
associated logic, RTL, are introduced, as is a tool for building 
specifications.  Two approaches are then used to analyze the specification.
The Modechart simulator is used to exhibit individual behaviors of the system.
The Modechart verifier is used to verify global properties of the system.

"Automata-theoretic verification of real-time systems,"</b> <font color="#000000">Rajiv Alur (AT&T Laboratories) and David Dill (Stanford Univ.)
<p>
We propose "timed (finite) automata" to model the behavior of real-time
systems over time.  Our definition provides a simple, and yet powerful,
way to annotate state-transition graphs with timing constraints using
finitely many real-valued clocks.  A timed automaton accepts timed
words --- infinite sequences in which a real-valued time of occurrence
is associated with each symbol. We study timed automata from the
perspective of formal language theory: we consider closure properties,
decision problems, and subclasses.  We discuss the application of this
theory to automatic verification of real-time requirements of
finite-state systems.  Finally, we give an overview of the heuristics
employed by different tools to alleviate the computational complexity
of the verification algorithm.

"Formal verification of real-time systems using timed automata,"</b> <font color="#000000">Constance Heitmeyer  (Naval Research Lab) and Nancy Lynch (MIT)                
<p>
The use of the Lynch-Vaandrager timed automaton model is illustrated
with a solution to  the Generalized Railroad Crossing problem.  The
solution shows formally the correspondence between four system
descriptions:  an axiomatic (i.e., descriptive) specification, an
operational specification represented in terms of timed automata, a
discrete system implementation, and a system implementation that works
with a continuous gate model.  Several sample proofs are given.  In the
development of the solution, a number of guidelines were applied.
These guidelines, which should prove useful in applying formal methods
to practical systems, are described and illustrated with examples.

"Refining system requirements to program specifications,"</b> <font color="#000000">Ernst-R&#252;diger Olderog, Anders P. Ravn, and Jens U. Skakkeb&#230;k  
<p>
A coherent and mathematically well-founded approach to the design of
real-time and hybrid systems is presented.  It covers requirements
analysis and specification, design of controlling automata satisfying
the requirements, and derivation of occam-like communicating programs
from these automata.  The generalized railroad crossing illustrates the
approach.  Requirements are analyzed within a conventional dynamic
systems model of a plant, where states are functions of the reals,
representing time. The requirements are specified in an
assumption-commitment style using the Duration Calculus, a real-time
interval logic. Controlling real-time automata are specified in the
same formalism by  elementary constraints on the plant states for each
control state or phase.  The Duration Calculus is used to verify that
the control design refines the requirements.  The real-time automata
map smoothly to component descriptions in a systems design language
that uses timed trace assertions over state transition events to
constrain control flow.  Components can under certain conditions be
transformed to occam-like communicating programs.

<p>
We report on our ongoing research whose long-term goal is to build
methods and tools for developing industrial-strength real-time systems.
We describe two independent but coordinated approaches, one an
operational formalism based on Petri nets and the other a specification
language based on logic. Both formalisms are specially designed to deal
with time-critical aspects of real-time systems. We also describe our
prototype tools and our experience in applying the tools in industrial
projects.  In the long term, we plan to integrate the two approaches so
that system structure is described formally by a Petri net, whereas
system properties are expressed and proved in the logic language. We
discuss the advantages of such a ``dual language'' approach and the
barriers to applying the approach to industrial projects in the short
term.

<p>
This chapter describes a timed process algebra, called ACSR, which
supports time-consuming actions and instantaneous events.  Actions
model the usage of shared resources and the passage of time, whereas
events allow synchronization between processes.  To be able to specify
real-time systems accurately, ACSR supports static priorities that can
be used to arbitrate between actions competing for shared resources
and between events that are ready for synchronization.  ACSR also
offers different notions of equivalence that can be used to verify
that two processes behave the same.  ACSR is illustrated through the
specification and analysis of a scheduler example, as well as three
variants of the railroad crossing problem.

"Constraint-oriented specification style for time-dependent behaviors,"</b>
 <font color="#000000">Tommaso Bolognesi
<p>
In this chapter we emphasize human-oriented usage of formal
specifications, and insist that these be not only amenable to automated
analysis but also appealing to human intuition and understanding.  We
concentrate on a specification style called `constraint-oriented',
which is meant to simplify the writing and reading of formal
descriptions by approximating, in some aspects, the style of informal
descriptions as expressed in natural language.  The constraint-oriented
style has already been applied succesfully to specifications in
standard LOTOS; in this chapter we show how it naturally extends to the
specification of time-dependent behaviours in timed LOTOS.  The
approach is illustrated by the Generalized Railroad Crossing example.

"Analysis of real-time systems using symbolic techniques,"</b> <font color="#000000">Sergio Campos, Edmund Clarke, and Marius Minea (Carnegie-Mellon Univ.)
<p>
The chapter presents the use of symbolic model checking for the
verification of real-time systems.  This method automatically
determines whether a temporal logic specification is satisfied for a
finite state model. Symbolic techniques use a representation based on
binary decision diagrams, which allow extremely large state spaces to
be handled. Real-time logics have been introduced that allow the
expression of time-bounded properties.  In addition, we have introduced
quantitative reasoning in the verification process.  The algorithms
that we have developed produce quantitative information about a
real-time system, in addition to determining its correctness. This
information allows a more detailed analysis than possible with previous
methods. These techniques have been applied to the verification of a
number of real-world system, of which we present a few examples: an
aircraft controller, a robotics system, a medical monitoring system and
the PCI local bus. These examples demonstrate that the techniques are
able to verify complex, realistic systems.

"End-to-end design of real-time systems,"</b> <font color="#000000">Richard Gerber, Seongsoo Hong, Dong-In Kang, and Manas Saksena
<p>
This chapter presents a comprehensive design methodology for
guaranteeing end-to-end requirements of real-time systems.
Applications are structured as a set of process components, connected
by asynchronous channels, in which the endpoints are the system's
external inputs and outputs.  Timing constraints are then postulated
between these inputs and outputs; they express properties such as
end-to-end propagation delay, temporal input-sampling correlation, and
allowable separation times between updated output values.  The
automated design method works as follows:  First new tasks are created
to correlate related inputs.  An optimization algorithm, whose
objective is to minimize CPU utilization, transforms the end-to-end
requirements into a set of intermediate rate constraints on the tasks.
If the algorithm fails to find a solution to the constraints, a
restructuring tool attempts to eliminate bottlenecks by transforming
the application. Then it is re-submitted to the assignment algorithm.
The final result is a schedulable set of fully periodic tasks that
collaboratively maintain the end-to-end constraints.

<H3>ABSTRACT</H3>
<p>
The DoD Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria 
define requirements corresponding to specified levels of security functions 
and assurance.  They do not, however, help determine what 
level system is required for a specific environment.  A
a simplistic technique has been proposed for this purpose that takes 
into account only the classification of the most sensitive information 
processed by a system, the clearance of its least-cleared user, and the 
environment in which it was developed.  
This paper offers a straightforward but richer technique a developer can use
to map a specific system architecture and application environment to
a particular requirement level as defined in the Criteria.  It accounts for
differences in functions provided to different users and the ways users 
can invoke those functions, as well as for users' clearances and the 
sensitivity of data.  This
technique is applicable throughout the system life cycle, so that security
requirements can be updated as changes to system structure and function
occur.

<H3>INTRODUCTION</H3>
<p>
This paper presents a method for determining the hardware and 
software security requirements of a system, based on
<ul>
<li>the local processing capability available to a system user;
<li>the kind of communication path between the user's local device and the 
primary system components;
<li>the flexibility of the processing capability the system provides to the user;
<li>the environment in which the system was developed; and
<li>the difference between the clearance held by the least cleared user of the 
system and the classification of the most sensitive data processed by the 
system.
</ul>
The technique presented here represents the technical judgment of the 
authors and does not necessarily represent the views or policy of their 
respective organizations or of the U.S. Navy.
<p>
This method can be understood as a risk evaluation of a system
that can be conducted at a very early stage in the life cycle of a system
and repeated as the structure and functions of the system change 
during its development and operation.  
Depending on the inherent risk that a system (or system design) displays, 
different levels of security requirements may be imposed in order to reduce the
operational risk of the system to an acceptable level.  Applications of
this method to several environments are provided as examples.  Although
developed based on consideration of DoD environments, the method seems 
applicable to other environments
to the extent that the Orange Book requirements apply to them.
<p>
The technique described here does not consider requirements for degaussing
of removable storage, TEMPEST requirements, protection from physical
hazards, emergency destruction, or other security requirements not related
to the hardware and software architecture of the system.
<H3>
STRUCTURE OF THE ORANGE BOOK</H3>
<p>
The DoD Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (the ``Orange Book'' [1] 
provides a set of security requirements of two kinds:
specific security feature requirements, which call for particular 
system functions in order to provide data security, and assurance requirements,
which call for testing, documentation, and verification to assure that the
security features are  correctly implemented.
A system that satisfies all requirements listed in the 
Orange Book would be designated A1.  Systems that satisfy specified, 
nested subsets of the requirements are designated B3, B2, B1, C2, C1, D, 
in order of decreasing requirements.
<p>
The Orange Book does not provide guidance as to what level of system
is appropriate for a particular operational environment.  A draft 
application doctrine [2] has been developed, however, that
defines the level of system required for a particular environment based
only on the classification of the data processed by the system, the
clearances of its users, and the environment in which it was developed.  
This simple scheme is inadequate for use in
assessing security requirements of many complex systems;  a more 
comprehensive method is proposed below.
<H3>
APPLYING TECHNICAL COMPUTER SECURITY GUIDANCE EFFECTIVELY
</H3>
<p>
Although it is imperfect in many respects, as a technical basis for 
specifying computer security requirements, the
Orange Book is the most comprehensive and current document available.
A method is needed for applying the Orange Book to the components
of large scale, geographically dispersed systems, so 
that the appropriate requirements from the Orange Book
book can be identified for each host system.  Such a method is defined
below.  As shown in Figure 1, it involves:
<ol>
<li>
extracting from each system (or system design) the factors 
that affect the risk that its operation may
lead to the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, 
<li>quantifying these factors, and 
<li>determining system security requirements
(in terms of the levels defined in the Orange Book) that reduce the system
risk to an acceptable level.

<p>
This method can be understood as a 
risk evaluation based on the threat of unauthorized disclosure 
of sensitive information.  The asset of the system is sensitive information, 
defined in terms of its classification level, and the vulnerabilities of the
system depend on the degree of control it exerts on its users.  The system
risk combines the value of the assets, the vulnerabilities of the system,
and the clearance of the users.
<H3>
Identifying the Risk Factors</H3>
<p>
To determine a system's security requirements 
it is necessary to consider the environment in which that system operates.
The Orange Book specifies levels of requirements independent of system 
environment; the draft application doctrine [2] characterizes a system's 
environment in terms of three parameters:  the maximum clearance of the least 
cleared user, the
maximum classification of data processed by the system, and the environment
in which the system is developed and maintained (open or closed).  While
simple to evaluate, these parameters omit important factors that affect actual 
system risk.  
<p>
The following paragraphs explain the factors that should be taken into 
account.  For each factor, different levels of risk are defined
so that the difference between two adjacent levels in each factor represents 
a roughly comparable increase (or decrease) in risk.  
Factors are defined so that they are roughly independent -- a
change in one factor does not imply a change in another factor.  These
properties allow numbering the risk levels and combining 
them in most cases using simple addition.  
<p>
Something as abstract as risk cannot be quantified precisely.
Recognizing this, we have not attempted to make fine distinctions, and no
doubt some systems will still fall near the boundaries of the proposed classes.
Nevertheless, the scheme described below, coarse as it is,
captures the intuition and experience of computer security practitioners and is
preferable to simply setting these considerations aside because they cannot
be made precise.
<p>
<b>Local Processing Capability</b>.  Some systems have receive-only 
terminals (e.g., stock transaction displays, airline terminal monitors);  
users of such terminals have no way to enter system commands 
directly.  Such terminals represent a lower level of risk than
typical interactive terminals that permit both sending and receiving
information.  Replacing a fixed-function interactive terminal with a 
programmable terminal, personal computer, or other programmable device
would introduce a still higher level of risk, since the user can now
program his terminal to enter commands for him.  A user who accesses 
a system from a fixed-function terminal but via a programmable host computer
would be considered to have the same local processing capability as 
one who uses a personal computer as a terminal.  
The identified risk levels for local processing capability are:
<ul>
<li>Level 1:  receive-only terminal
<li>Level 2:  fixed-function interactive terminal
<li>Level 3:  programmable device (access via personal computer or programmable host)
</ul>
<p>
<b>Communication Path</b>.  The communication path between a terminal 
and host can also affect system risk.  A terminal that has
a simplex receive-only link to its host via a store-and-forward network 
(e.g., via radio broadcast) poses less risk than one
that is connected via a duplex store-and-forward link, since the simplex
path prevents the user from submitting requests to the system.  Terminals that
are connected to a host either directly, through a local-area network,
or long-haul packet network (e.g., Telnet, DDN) offer increased 
possibilities for penetration and misuse (inadvertant or otherwise) over 
those connected only through a
store-and-forward net because of the increased bandwidth and closer 
host-terminal interaction they permit.
The identified risk levels for communication path are:
<ul>
<li>Level 1:  
store/forward, receive-only
<li>Level 2:  
store/forward, send/receive
<li>Level 3:  
interactive, via direct connection, local-area net, or long-haul packet net
</ul>
<p>
<b>User Capability</b>.  Regardless of the local processing available to
a user or the communication path he uses to access a host, if that host
is programmed only to provide predefined outputs regardless of the inputs
the user presents, it is less risky than a system that responds to
user transactions.  In this sense, the system that generates
the ticker tape for a stock exchange is less at risk to the terminals
that display the tape than an interactive electronic banking system is 
to automated teller machines.  Finally, a transaction-based system is
less at risk from its users than a system that permits its users full
programming capabilities.  
The identified risk levels for user capability are:
<ul>
<li>Level 1:  output only
<li>Level 2:  transaction processing
<li>Level 3:  full programming
</ul>
<p>
<b>Development/Maintenance Environment</b>.  A system that has been developed
and is maintained by cleared individuals under close configuration control
(closed environment) should pose less risk than one that is not developed 
and maintained in this way (open environment).  This distinction has been 
proposed in the draft application doctrine [2].  It seems a reasonable one, 
but relatively few examples of systems developed and maintained according
to the proposed definition of ``closed environment'' have been identified 
outside of the intelligence community.  For simplicity,
we assume that systems are developed and operated in an 
open environment.  Systems that are developed and maintained in a closed
environment may therefore be subject to slightly less stringent requirements
than will result from our approach.
<p>
<b>Data Exposure</b>.  A system that has a greater disparity between the
clearance of its least cleared user and the classification of
the most sensitive data it processes is more at risk than one that has
a lesser disparity.  The draft application doctrine proposes a scheme for
numbering and classifying ``risk range''  we adopt this scheme but call
it ``data exposure'' to distinguish it from other risk factors.  Although
clearance and classification levels used are based on the DoD system, they
do include levels for sensitive but unclassified data and users authorized
access for such data.  For non-DoD environments, it seems likely that 
analogous clearance/classification levels could be defined.
Clearance levels are identified as:
<ul>
<li>Level 0:
uncleared
<li>Level 1:
uncleared, but authorized access to sensitive unclassified information
<li>Level 2:
confidential clearance
<li>Level 3:
secret clearance
<li>Level 4:
top secret/background investigation
<li>Level 5:
top secret/special background investigation
<li>Level 6:
top secret/special background investigation, with authorization for one
compartment
<li>Level 7:
top secret/special background investigation, with authorization for more
than one compartment
</ul>
<p>
Classification levels are numbered:
<ul>
<li>Level 0:  
unclassified
<li>Level 1:  
sensitive unclassified information
<li>Level 2:  
confidential 
<li>Level 3:  
secret 
<li>Level 4:  
secret with one category
<li>Level 5:  
top secret with no categories or secret with two or more categories
<li>Level 6:  
top secret with one category 
<li>Level 7:  
top secret with two or more categories 
</ul>
<p> 
Data exposure is computed as the difference between the level of the
least cleared user of a system and the maximum level of data processed
by the system.  It thus ranges from a value of 0 (all users cleared
for all data) to 7 (system processes top secret data with two or more
categories and some users are uncleared).
<H3>
Applying the Risk Factors</H3>
<p>
For a particular system, each of the risk factors needs to be evaluated
in order to assess the overall (``system'') risk.  With minor exceptions, 
the system risk is simply the sum of the risks of the individual risk 
factors.  Based on system risk and data exposure,
security requirements can be determined.  These requirements are characterized
here in terms of the levels defined in the Orange Book because they
have been published and reviewed widely.  If a different subsetting of the
Orange Book requirements later proves more appropriate 
than the current set of levels, the new subsets can be substituted.
Tables 1-3 provide the necessary mappings between factor values, risk factor
levels, and security requirements.  The first two tables are only needed
because of the exceptions mentioned above;  usually, Table 3 can be used
directly with the sum of the individual risk factors.
<p>
Note that in a given system, different
terminals may provide different functions, lead to different levels of risk, 
and impose different security requirements.  Security requirements for the 
system as a whole must be determined on the basis of the most risky part.
As noted previously, the tables below assume all systems are 
developed/maintained under conditions of an open environment.

		Table 1.  Process Coupling Risk
</PRE>
<p>
<b>Table 1.</b> Together, local processing capability and communication path 
characterize what computer security literature refers to as the ``process 
coupling'' risk.  This term is intended to cover how well a process 
in one computer can maintain its integrity in the face of attempts to subvert 
it from outside.  A high degree of coupling represents a close degree of 
interaction between two processes, and hence a greater vulnerability of one to 
the other.  If there is a very limited, well-defined set of requests one 
process can make of the other, then the degree of process coupling will be 
low.  Process coupling risk in a system, as shown in Table 1,
is the sum of the local processing capability and communication path
risks, with one exception.  A fixed function interactive terminal 
attached to a one-way store-and-forward communication path does not increase
risk over a receive-only terminal on the same link.  A programmable
device increases risk over the interactive terminal, since, if 
improperly programmed, it might corrupt labels transmitted with data.

<p>
<b>Table 2.</b>  The process coupling value from Table 1, combined with the
appropriate user capability factor value yields an overall system risk
independent of the data exposure.  As in Table 1, the entries of Table 2
have been obtained by summing the risk factor values from each
axis.  The entries for a process coupling of 2 (receive-only or interactive
terminal on a receive-only link) have been omitted for user capabilities
of transaction processing and full programming, since a receive-only link
cannot support either of these capabilities.

	       Table 3.  Mapping System Risk and Data
	 	         Exposure to Orange Book Requirements Levels
</PRE>
<p>
<b>Table 3</b>.  This table relates the system risk with the
data exposure to yield a level from the Orange Book that defines the security
requirements for the system.  As noted above, the Orange Book levels may later
be replaced by related, but distinct, sets of features and assurances.
The entries in this table were generated by working through examples
and considering the guidance provided by the draft application doctrine [2]
and current DoD directives governing compartmented mode.  Blank entries 
indicate that, for the specified data exposure
level and system risk, it appears technically infeasible to 
meet the appropriate security requirements at the time.  
.bp
<H3>
EXAMPLES</H3><p>
<H3>
A Sea Surface Surveillance System (S4)</H3>
<p>
Consider the application of the technique outlined above to a hypothetical
system that keeps track of objects on the surface of the seas (see Figure 2).
The system collects information from 
a variety of open and secret sources and distributes it to a variety of 
customers.  The system maintains a data base of sighting information 
that is both automatically and manually updated.
There are two major classes of users: analysts and subscribers.  
<p>
S4 analysts are the direct
operators of the system:  they are called on to resolve ambiguities when
the system cannot associate a particular sighting with a particular platform,
they can cause messages to be sent to subscribers automatically on a 
regular basis, and
they can update the data base.  They operate interactive terminals that
are located in S4 spaces and connected directly to the S4 computers.
<p>
S4 subscribers are the recipients of reports generated by S4.  They
are located outside the S4 spaces and receive reports over a variety of
different communication networks on receive-only terminals.  They 
cannot directly enter data into the S4 system, but they can issue requests 
(via normal message channels) for regular updates on the location of 
particular objects, for example.  
These requests are received by S4 analysts who cause filters to be set up
that automatically channel relevant reports to the subscriber.  Once the
appropriate filter is set up, no further human intervention is required.
<p>
Since analysts and subscribers are permitted different kinds of
functions, have different clearances, and communicate with the S4 system over 
different paths, it is necessary to apply this technique to each
class of user separately.  
<p>
<b>Local Processing Capability.</b>
Analysts operate fixed function interactive terminals, so they represent
a risk level of 2.  Subscribers operate receive-only terminals, yielding
a risk level of 1.
<p>
<b>Communication Path.</b>
Analysts communicate with S4 machines directly, so their risk level is 3.
Subscribers communicate over a one-way store-and-forward network, so their
risk level is 1. 
<p>
<b>User Capability.</b>
Analysts are permitted to issue transactions directly to S4, but they 
do not have full programming capability, so the risk level is 2.  
Subscribers have output-only capability, so the risk level is 1.
<p>
<b>Data Exposure.</b>
S4 processes data at the TS level with multiple compartments, so the
classification level is 7.
S4 analysts hold TS clearances with SBI and are authorized access 
for all compartments that S4 processes.  Consequently, their clearance
level is also 7 and the data exposure for analysts is 0.
Some S4 subscribers hold only Secret clearances with no compartment
authorizations, so their clearance level is 3, yielding a data exposure
for subscribers of 4.
<p>
<b>Using the Tables.</b>
First, for analysts, Table 1 shows that a
local processing capability risk of 2 and communication path risk of 3
yields a process coupling risk of 5.  Table 2 combines a user capability
risk of 2 with a process coupling risk of 5 to yield a system risk of 7.
Table 3 maps a data exposure of 0 and a system risk of 7 to a
C2 level system requirement.
<p>
For subscribers, Table 1 combines a local processing capability risk of 1
with a communication path risk of 1 to yield a process coupling risk of 2.
Table 2 combines a user capability risk of 1 with a process coupling risk of 
2 to give a system risk of 3.  Finally, Table 3 maps a data exposure of
4 and a system risk of 3 to a B2 level system requirement.
<p>
Since S4 includes both kinds of users, the more stringent 
of the two requirements (i.e., B2) would apply.  Changes to the environments
of either subscribers or analysts (such as the introduction of personal
computers in place of fixed function terminals) would require the risk
evaluation to be repeated, and could lead to a change in the level of 
security requirement.
<H3>
Evolution of the S4 System</H3>
<p>
Suppose that after initial deployment of S4, its subscribers 
clamor for terminals more up-to-date than the original receive-only
ones.  The system sponsor proposes to replace them with 
personal computers (see Figure 3).  What are the effects on the security that 
the host system needs to provide?  The local processing capability risk
factor changes from 1 to 3, and the system risk becomes a 5;  the data
exposure for subscribers is unchanged.  Table 3 shows that the host should
security should be upgraded from B2 to B3.  If, in addition to the 
personal computers the sponsor permits subscribers to communicate with the
system over a real-time network and to initiate transactions, the 
system risk becomes 8, and an A1 host would be indicated.  By estimating
the additional cost of replacing or upgrading the S4 host to the B3 or A1
level, the sponsor can quantify the cost of providing new functions
while maintaining an acceptable level of risk for the system.
<H3>
``Orange Book Environment''</H3>
<p>
The Orange Book does not explicitly define an environment.  However, the
predecessors of the Orange Book criteria were first developed in the 
context of an interactive computer
system that provided users with directly connected, fixed-function 
terminals and full programming capability.  The corresponding entries in
Tables 1 and 2 yield a system risk of 8.  Since no 
data exposure is defined for the Orange Book environment, it is appropriate
to consider 
the result for the Air Force Data Services Center (AFDSC) Multics environment, 
which provides full programming to users at fixed function, directly connected
terminals.   AFDSC Multics includes non-compartmented data classified up 
to top secret and some users have only secret clearances, so the data exposure
is 2, and the resulting security requirement from Table 3 is for a B1/B2
system.  Multics is currently under evaluation by the DoD Computer Security
Evaluation Center and is expected to achieve a B2 rating.
<H3>
DISCUSSION
</H3>
<p>
Here we address some possible objections to the approach described
above.
<p>
<i>Objection</i>:  the proposed scheme imposes different requirements on 
a host computer based on characteristics of the user's terminal
and the communication path between the terminal and the host.  These are
outside the security perimeter of the host and therefore should not
affect the security required of it.  
<p>
<i>Response</i>:  security considerations include not only protecting data up 
to the point that it leaves the system but also resisting attacks on the 
system mounted by external users.  Users with personal computers and direct
connections to systems have proven a greater threat (e.g. in terms of their
ability to defeat password schemes) than those who have only fixed-function
terminals at their disposal.  Each higher Orange Book 
level adds assurance requirements as well as security feature requirements.
While the security features added at a particular level may or may not improve
protection against threats posed by terminals and networks connected to a host,
the increased assurance provided by each incremental
level should decrease the likelihood of flaws that could be exploited
from outside the security perimeter.  It is thus appropriate to increase the 
Orange Book level required of a host based on the risk factors assigned to 
the user capability and communication path.
<p>
<i>Objection</i>:  the proposed approach in some cases permits hosts to meet 
lower security requirements than would the draft application doctrine[2].
<p>
<i>Response</i>:  the approach proposed here distinguishes
aspects of application system structure that reduce its vulnerability to 
outside attacks.   The draft application doctrine determines the level
of system required based primarily on the clearances of system users
and the classification of data stored in the system.  There is no 
distinction, for example, between a system in which users can only
view output and one in which users can construct and execute their own 
programs.  Consequently, the proposed requirements must be based on the
worst case assumption (user programming).  By providing a more detailed
model of the environment, the approach proposed here permits a more 
accurate assessment of the security actually required.
<p>
<i>Objection</i>:  previous attempts to distinguish rigorously between a system
that can be programmed and one to which only transactions can be submitted
have failed.
<p>
<i>Response</i>:  while a formal mathematical distinction between systems that 
users can program and those that perform a fixed set of functions in response 
to user requests may never be defined, it does not seem to be a difficult
distinction to make in practice.  In cases that are difficult to decide 
(e.g., a ``transaction-processing'' database system that permits a
complex query and update capability) it is safe to assign the system
the higher risk factor.
<p>
<i>Objection</i>:  because the proposed approach determines host security 
requirements partly based on system architecture, changes to the architecture 
may lead to different security requirements.
<p>
<i>Response</i>:  this is actually a benefit of the approach.   As a system 
changes during its design, development, and operation, the effects of those 
changes on host security requirements can be easily assessed,
providing a practical way to use the Orange
Book requirements throughout the system life cycle.  If, for example, 
a B2 host will not be available to support an application as originally
planned and a B1 host must be used instead, the approach proposed here can help
determine how system functions, user capabilities, or communication
paths could be restricted to compensate for the less secure host.  Conversely,
if new functions or terminals are added to a system already under development, 
this approach can indicate whether host security will need to be upgraded
as a result.  The only tradeoff that would be recognized under the draft
application doctrine would be to limit the classification of the data to
be processed by the system or increase the clearance of its users.
<H3>
CONCLUSION
</H3>
<p>
We have presented a scheme for determining an appropriate set of host
security requirements using the requirements and levels identified
in the Orange Book.  The scheme takes into account the functions available
to a user locally, the communication path used to gain access to the
host, and the functions the host provides, as well as the user's clearance
and the classification of data processed by the host.   By including
these system characteristics, this technique makes it possible to assess
trade-offs among system function, system architecture, and system 
costs while maintaining an acceptable level of system risk.

A search engine called "<a href="http://www.mckinley.com">
Magellan Internet Guide</a>"
(http://www.mckinley.com) offers an option called Search Voyeur
(exactly what I felt like), which displays a continually updated list
of "20 randomly selected real-time searches that users like you are
now performing on Magellan" (like me?). I was treated to several
selections including "nude celbs", "how can meet tory aikman", "high
school bands", "europiccola", "floral design projects", and "sexual
harassment policy". Searches can clearly include worrisome information
like personal names, and it's not clear from the home page (if you're
just intent on issuing a search) that your search parameters could be
broadcast to the Net.

A bug in Netscape 3.0 (fixed in 3.01) allowed a web page with
Javascript to send email (along with the configured email address)
without warning the user. Discussion again brought up the need for
more levels of defense (beyond disabling Javascript) such as signed
applets. 
<p>
There was a lot of discussion about the significance of the
cryptanalytic DES (and 3DES) attack announced by Biham and Shamir,
which is a theoretical attack based on inducing faults via physical
access (such as with microwave radiation). The concern is mostly about
smartcards, and the attack was compared to other sorts of fraud that
is tolerated with other kinds of payment mechanisms (cash, check,
credit cards). An experiment verifying the theoretical results would
raise the level of concern somewhat.  They announced follow-up
research on discovering secret keys even when the operation of the
cryptosystem is unknown (such as with Skipjack).<i>[See news item

Another challenge to ITAR based on freedom of speech is being raised
by Peter Junger, a law professor at Case Western Reserve
University. He argues that he can't even discuss the legality of ITAR
in the presence of non-US students as the law is written
(<a href="http://sun.soci.niu.edu/~cudigest/CUDS8/cud870">

Discussion on the IETF's Transaction Level Security (TLS) working
group centered on overall strategy and authentication methods. There
is pressure to produce a document, and a cleaned-up version of SSL
v3.0 would be easy and useful for future SSL developers. Proposals
have been advanced for adding secret key authentication and Kerberos
to TLS 1.0. Proponents cite practical deployment issues; opponents
worry that weakness in chosen passwords or secret key schemes could
damage the percieved strenght of TLS.

Microsoft distributed a CD-ROM with a document infected with the

A Dallas judge has issued what is thought to be the first injunction
delivered via email and usenet. "It's our position that under Texas
state law whenever a person has knowledge of an order, that is
sufficient notice," one of the attorneys in case said. For those of

Privacy Assured, which is a pilot program of the Electronic Frontier 
Foundation's eTrust project, will post its blue PA logo on Web sites 
that adhere to its standards.  These standards include: not knowingly 
listing information about individuals that has not been volunteered 
for publication; not allowing reverse searches to determine 
individuals' names from e-mail addresses, phone numbers or other 
information; releasing only aggregated usage statistics, not 
individual information; and giving individuals the option to delete 
personal information from lists.

Adam Shostack shared information derived from his real-world
experience with code reviews.  They find security & reliability bugs
at about one per 20-50 lines of code, which is dropping to closer to
one per hundred as he distributes copies of code review guidelines he
wrote (<a href="http://www.homeport.org/~adam/review.html">
http://www.homeport.org/~adam/review.html</a>).  Reviewing superficially
takes about an hour for 500-1000 lines of commented code.  A deep
review to find tricky problems can take much longer. They've found
that a review team of fewer than 4 people is less effective at finding
problems.  Reviewing more than about 2000 lines of code (2-3 hours) in
a day can cause burn-out.

The latest Clinton administration proposal for "key recovery" caused a
lot of discussion. The proposal would still include communication
keys, which are unnecessary for the recovery of data that is stored
encrypted and only useful for the monitoring of communications. The
main issue is privacy of these communications. It is still not clear
what key recovery mechanisms the market would produce, since the
government will have to approve of key recovery plans before allowing
56 bit encryption to be exported. Nonetheless, it's the first proposal
with a carrot component, and many companies have announced that they
tend to comply. Apple, often cheered in privacy advocate circles, has
announced they will comply (along with IBM, Digital, RSA, and others),
while Microsoft, often reviled in the same circles, is holding out
(along with Netscape). 
<p>
Mitsubishi Electric Corp. said it has released the design principles
and a sample program for its proprietary data encryption algorithm
MISTY (<a href="http://www.melco.co.jp/rd_home/new/crypt_e.html">
http://www.melco.co.jp/rd_home/new/crypt_e.html</a>). Proprietary
encryption algorithms have a poor reputation in the cryptographic
community, since they are often written by cryptographers with little
experience, and many cryptographic algorithms have flaws that are only
discovered after extensive and lengthy (years) peer review. I was not
able to find the location of this information.
<p>
Rumor has it that one or more spoof sites were able to take advantage
of the syntax issues of URLs. Bob Dole announced a site at something
like dole-kemp96.com at the end of one of the debates. Some variant of
trying with and without the hyphen and using org instead of com got
you to a spoof site. I can no longer find any spoofs, and both
dolekemp96.com and dolekemp96.org look fairly legitimate.
<p>
Dallas Semiconductor announced something called an iButton, which can
be used for authentication. There were concerns raised over its random
number generator and PIN protection. A co-worker showed me one
embedded in a plastic ring, and it definately evoked a "Captain Crunch
Decoder Ring" feel, which made me want one. 
<p>
Jeff Schiller, IETF Security Area Director, formally recommended to
the IPSEC working group that the mandatory key management protocol for
IPv6 be ISAKMP/Oakley, and that SKIP be optional.

<TITLE>More Tamper Attacks 
</TITLE>
<p>
[Updated 20 November 1996] <br>
<p>
The <a href="961001.SCflawrep.html"> 
announcement</a> in late September by Bellcore researchers of an attack
on smart card security based on causing failures in the card (see
Cipher EI #17) has been followed by several papers on attacks based
on introducing faults into crypto systems, one from by Biham
and Shamir in Israel, another by a group of researchers in Singapore,
and a third from Ross Anderson proposing a tamper attack on DES.
"tamperproof" devices.  In addition, Ross Anderson and Markus Kuhn have
posted a paper documenting various kinds of attacks on tamper-resistant
devices, including one successful attack on a smartcard currently in
circulation. At this writing, the Bellcore paper still seems available
only as a press release. Finally, Paul Kocher contributed a note to the
RISKS forum suggesting that these kinds of attacks are far from new.
[Added 18 November: Ross Anderson and Markus Kuhn released a new note
on 15 November, which is available below.]

<TITLE>Next Generation Internet: Faster, But More Secure?</TITLE>
<H2>Next Generation Internet: Faster, But More Secure?</H2>
<p>
On October 10, the Clinton administration announced a "Next Generation
Internet" intended to connect universities and research labs with
high speed networks from 100-1000 times faster those currently in use.
The administration's press release, available at:
<a href="http://www.iitf.nist.gov/documents/press/internet.htm">
http://www.iitf.nist.gov/documents/press/internet.htm</a>
suggested a variety of technologies and applications that might be the
subject of experiments on the NGI, including health care, national
security, distance education, and so on. "Software to assure reliability
and security of information transmitted over the Internet" is listed
last in a list of eight example technologies to be "identified and
deployed" in the NGI to "help the Internet continue its exponential
rate of growth."  Identifying and deploying technologies does not seem
to imply developing them.  The administration plans to reallocate
$100M of FY98 funds, $70M from the defense budget, to initiate the
program.  The funding will apparently flow into the budget of the
High Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC) initiative,
which has not been a strong contributor to security technology in
the past.

<TITLE>Set Top Box Subject to US Crypto Export Controls</TITLE>
<H2>Set Top Box Subject to US Crypto Export Controls</H2>
<p>
A $300 set-top box being built in the U.S. by Sony and Philips
Electronics that encrypts communications between the box and its
server with 128-bit keys has consequently been classified as requiring
a special export license, according to a report by John Markoff in
the New York Times, November 8.  If the box incorporated the new
"key recovery" scheme that the administration announced in early
October (see Cipher EI #17), the 128-bit crypto would not be a bar to
its export. Or, if the producers could show plans to implement a key
recovery sceme, they would presumably be permitted to export a version
that restricted itself to using 56-bit keys.

<TITLE>BSI Offers Free Security Guidelines CD-ROM for Comment</TITLE>
<pre>
From Carsten Schultz, of BSI:
</pre>
<p>
IT Baseline Protection Manual 1996
<p>
GISA (the German Information Security Agency, also known as BSI,
which is the German abbreviation) was founded in 1990. One of its
tasks is the counselling and support of governmental agencies,
companies, etc. about all questions of IT security, especially about
how to develop IT security concepts.
<p>
The activities of counselling and support also include the task to
develop and improve methods for the development of IT security
concepts. For this, up to now, mainly the method of detailed risk
analysis is used. Performing a detailed risk analysis has the
advantage that the safeguards selected following such a review are
appropriate for the security requirements of the IT system considered.
The disadvantage of this approach is that it is very time-consuming,
and needs a lot of expertise to obtain best results.
<p>
But these detailed considerations and results are really necessary
only in case of high protection requirements. For all other cases,
i.e. IT systems with low or medium protection requirements, the
implementation of standard security safeguards are very often
sufficient. This idea is known as baseline protection or as the
application of codes of practice. The combination of using a detailed
risk analysis where necessary, and a baseline approach where
appropriate offers the chance to minimise efforts and to achieve
optimal results. This combined approach is also recommended in the
'Guidelines for the Management of IT Security' developed in ISO/IEC
JTC1/SC27/WG1, and is used within companies and federal agencies.
<p>
To realise these baseline ideas within Germany, GISA published a first
version of the IT Baseline Protection Manual in 1994. This manual
recommends IT security safeguards which are adequate and sufficient
for medium-level protection requirements. For developing this manual,
GISA estimated the risks on the basis of known threats and
vulnerabilities and recommended countermeasures against these risks.
The threats and safeguards are described in detail in attached
catalogues. This serves to compare the actual security status with the
recommended baseline safeguards. 
<p>
Threats and recommended security safeguards are summarised in
generally applicable components, like organisation, personnel,
contingency planning, data protection, infrastructure, cabling, server
room, storage media archives, as well as in IT specific modules, like
DOS personal computer, UNIX system, Laptop PC, server-based PC
network, UNIX Network, data transmission systems, telecommunications
system, firewalls, etc. For the version to be published 1997, modules
about Windows NT (stand alone, client-server, and peer-to-peer),
Novell-Netware, and Windows 95 are being developed. 
<p>
The recommended safeguards are economic and easy to implement.
Furthermore, the description of each safeguard contained in the
catalogues gives advice concerning responsibilities, implementation
and audits. 
<p>
When using the IT Baseline Protection Manual, existing IT systems can
be described by a combination of appropriate modules (contained in the
chapters of the manual), which contain the  recommended safeguards.
Hence, the selection of safeguards can be accomplished by a simple
comparison between already existing and recommended safeguards.
<p>
This year, the IT Baseline Protection Manual is published on CD-ROM
(German: html format, English: Winword2 format). It is planned to
publish the English version also in HTML format in 1997. 
<p>
Maybe, you would like to know more about the IT Baseline Protection
Manual or to use it yourself. Fortunately, we can offer cost-free CDs
at the moment, as long as stocks last. The IT Baseline Protection
Manual is mainly written to be used by industry, governmental
organisations, and anybody else having a professional interest in IT
security. If you would like to order a CD, please send a short mail to
the address given below. We will reply by sending you a registration
form to be filled and sent back. After receiving the form, we will
deliver the CD.   
<p>
We would like to ask all users of the IT Baseline Protection Manual to
tell us their opinion, criticism, and suggestions for improvement and
corrections. These suggestions will help the future development of the
manual.

<TITLE>Gore Announces Changes in US Crypto Export Policies
</TITLE>
<p>
[1 October 1996] <br>
<p>
Vice President Gore announced today that the United States would permit
the export of 56-bit key lenth encryption products under general
license after a one-time review, contingent on industry commitments to
build and market future products that support key recovery.  The policy
presumes "that a trusted party (in some cases internal to the user's
organization) would recover the user's confidentiality key for the user
or for law enforcement officials acting under proper authority.  Access
to keys would be provided in accordance with destination country
policies and bilateral understandings.  No key length limits or
algorithm restrictions will apply to exported key recovery products."
Domestic use of key recovery will be voluntary, and  Americans remain
free to use any encryption system domestically.
<p>
In addition, encryption products would no longer be treated as
munitions; "after consultation with Congress, jurisdiction for
commercial encryption controls will be transferred from the State
Department to the Commerce Department.  The Administration also will
seek legislation to facilitate commercial key recovery, including
providing penalties for improper release of keys, and protecting key
recovery agents against liability when they properly release a key."
<p>
This policy will last "up to two years," after which time the export of
56-bit products not supporting key recovery would no longer be permitted.
Gore asserted that the new policy is "broadly consistent with the
recent recommendations of the National Research Council" (see Cipher
EI#15).
<p>
The announcement followed unattributed reports in today's <i>Washington Post</i>
and <i>New York Times</i> of the new policy.
Whether the new policy will succed in "cutting off an emotional four-year-old
debate with the computer industry over the export of information-scrambling  
technology," as the <i>Post</i> story suggested, may depend in part on
the public perception of the strength of 56-bit key products.  The <i>Post</i>
also reported that several companies, led by IBM, have a technical
plan that will comply with the new policy.
<p>
The possible effects of moving the export jurisdiction from State to
Commerce are discussed in a piece circulated by Stewart Baker, an
attorney with Steptoe and Johnson, formerly General Counsel for the
NSA. Mr. Baker writes that while the Commerce Department should have
the staff and procedures to avoid imposing unnecessary delays,  the FBI
and the Justice Department will now be involved, and they are newcomers
to this process.  Further, the Commerce Department has an established
procedure for "foreign availability" reviews, which are intended to
determine whether "a product is so widely available abroad that
controls are ineffective and should be lifted."  The conduct and
procedures of such a review may be a point of contention between the
Commerce and Justice Departments, according to Baker.

<TITLE>Lipton, DeMillo Report Potential Smart Card Flaw 
</TITLE>
<p>
[26 September 1966] A potential security flaw may permit counterfeiting
of many types of electronic cash smart cards now circulating in Europe
and under test in the U.S., according to a report by John Markoff in
the Sept. 26 <i>New York Times</i>, page D1.  The flaw is documented in
a research paper that is about to be published by Richard Lipton and
two colleagues (one of whom seems to be Richard DeMillo).   
Lipton is chief scientist at Bell Communications Research
(Bellcore) as well as a professor of computer science at Princeton.
DeMillo, vice president for information technology at Bellcore, said
"Our technique is like tiny lever that makes it possible to pry open 
the vault that the secret information is stored
in." 
<p>
The attack evidently depends on forcing the smart card to make a 
calculation error;  the error would be used to provide information
about the secret data maintained within the card.  The error might
be triggered by irradiating the card or through other means.
<p>
A Mastercard executive who had been shown a draft of the report
characterized the attack as "speculative." Thorough assessment of the
practicality of the attack and its implications for chipcard
manufacturers and e-cash vendors awaits full publication of the
report.

<TITLE>LISTWATCH: Security List Items</TITLE>
<H2>Security-Related News Items from Security-Related Mailing Lists</H2>
by Mary Ellen Zurko, OSF Research Institute (zurko@osf.org)
<p>
This issue's highlights are from e$pam, http-wg, privacy, tbtf,
www-security, risks, and www-buyinfo.
<p>
The IPSEC working group of the IETF remains unable to come to
consensus about a key management standard. A design group tried to merge
SKIP, ISAKMP, and OAKLEY, and failed. Since people are fielding
encryption solutions that require key management, the concern is that
the lack of a standard will cause interoperability headaches, and slow
down the dissemination of encryption support. 
<p>
A popular pseudonmyous server in Finland (anon.penet.fi) with over
half a million users was shut down by its owner.  The owner is closing
it down for the time being "because the legal issues governing the
whole Internet in Finland are yet undefined."  A Finnish court's
preliminary decision was that the privacy remailers could be violated
by court order. The owner is collecting reactions for and against this
sort of service, and stories about why anyone would need such a
service, at support@anon.penet, against@anon.penet.fi, and
why@anon.penet.fi, respectively.
<p>
In the HTTP working group of the IETF, Digest Authentication (which
cryptographically hashes passwords instead of passing them in the
moral equivalent of the clear) is slated for inclusion in HTTP 1.1,
which is on its way to Proposed Standard. There has always been a
tension between getting a cheap replacement for Basic Authentication
out there fast, and making it a better protocol. Issues about
man-in-the-middle attacks are being raised again (servers can protect
against them, but don't have to). Netscape was taken to task for not
supporting Digest, while representatives of Netscape said that they
would not integrate something that was not stable. 
<p>
We're getting closer to the penny-a-page vision on the Web. Clickshare
(<a href=http://www.clickshare.com/clickshare> 
http://www.clickshare.com/clickshare</a>) 
is getting close to announcing
services that track movements and settle charges down to as little as
10 cents per query.
<p>
US Bank is beginning to thumb-print non-customers who cash
checks. Statistics indicate this is more of a deterrent than a way to
catch someone cashing a bad check.

A member of cypherpunks was interested in a good steganography program
for communicating with a friend in a country that is not
crypto-friendly. Someone has software that forms Mad-Lib style
sentences of the form "The _THING _VERBs to the _PLACE." Another
pointed to a program that can hide information in .gifs. A third has
worked on software that has a dictionary of pairs of synonyms (each
representing 1 or 0), that will scan freeform text and embed a bit in
each of the dictionary words it finds.

An interesting quote from DefCon founder Dark Tangent, a.k.a. Jeff
Moss: "Hacking as we know it is dying. Everything is specialized
today. There's wireless, IP, ISDN, NT -- it gets crazy."
<p>
Baruch Awerbuch, a professor of computer science at The
Johns Hopkins University, is studying the economics of sharing
computer power over the Internet (and calling it metacomputing). He
acknowledges that there are security issues, and "it will
also require a change in the close attachment most people feel toward
their computers."

A fair trading office in London found that mondex is not truly
anonymous (they were claiming it for a while until the complaint was
filed by PI director Simon Davies).  See

The folks at Princeton who found so many Java holes (including two
news ones in early August that allow full read/write access to files)
are turning their attention to Internet Explorer. They found a way to
run any DOS command on the machine of someone using IE that visits a
malicious page.
<p>
A U.S. Army private faces spying charges, but his lawyer claims that
he had broken into a supposedly impenetrable system after advising his
superiors of defects in the security system. He seems to have also
given a Chinese friend of his a password on an unclassified
system. See

<p>
In mid-August, the Department of Justice's Web site was broken into
and altered. Luckily for them, the alteration was fairly obvious (it
involved nudity and racism, as well as anti-CDA sentiments). Various
sites backed up the hacked site before the DoJ yanked it.
<p>
ActiveX's security model (or lack thereof) has been getting
discussion, since it might turn out to be Microsoft's answer to
Java. They plan on moving to signed signed applets, much like Java is
discussing signed classes. However, they have no encompassing sandbox
like Java's VM that provides additional restrictions. There's an
ActiveX control on the web that gracefully shuts down your Windows95
system (<a href=http://www.halcyon.com/mclain/ActiveX/>
http://www.halcyon.com/mclain/ActiveX/</a>).
<p>
The possibility of encrypting information for 100 years was discussed
on cypherpunks. The hottest issue seemed to be how to protect a key
for 100 years (in space, at the bottom of the ocean, escrowed with
long-lived institutions like the Catholic church, the Chinese
government, and Oxford).  
<p>
The Communication Security Corporation announced a telephone security
device supporting triple-DES.
<p>
Both Netscape and Microsoft have 128-bit US versions of their browsers
available.  Netscape uses the service
<a href=http://www.lookupusa.com/lookupusa/ada/ada.htm> 
http://www.lookupusa.com/lookupusa/ada/ada.htm</a> to determine if you can
receive the software electronically. It directly connects with a
mapping service so you can get a direct map for the person's exact
location. The original risks poster has an unlisted phone number, but
found himself. I have a phone number listed under my husband's name,
and did not find myself. They have a separate business lookup, but I
found my family's business in the personal lookup (they don't pay for
a business phone listing).
<p>
John Gilmore is trying to get 5% of the Internet encrypting
"opportunistically" by December. He's planning on putting IPSEC into
Linux, then using Linux gateways to encrypt all traffic when it's
going to a site behind another of the gateways 
(<a href=http://www.cygnus.com/~gnu/swan.html>
http://www.cygnus.com/~gnu/swan.html</a>).
<p>
In early August, the Sunday Times reported that American intelligence
agents hacked into European Parliament computers. 
<p>
Oregon will sell you a tape with license plate information on
it. Someone put a search engine into that data on the web, but then
suspended the service pending consideration of the ruckus
raised. There seems to be nothing illegal about it. 
<p>
MasterCard and VISA have chosen their CA's (GTE and Verisign,
respectively), and are planning on testing their SET implementations
in the fourth quarter of this year (in time for Xmas?).
<p>
In <a href=http://www.gsu.edu/~lawadmn/gsulaw.html> 
http://www.gsu.edu/~lawadmn/gsulaw.html</a>, the author posits that
encrypted email would be necessary to maintain attorney-client
confidentiality for all email concerning a client. 
<p>
It's the end of a Web era; www-buyinfo is shutting down. Dave Kristol
was the first to get many of us talking about electronic commerce on
the Web, and www-buyinfo spawned a bunch of email distribution lists
and working groups in the area.

<TITLE>LISTWATCH: Security List Items</TITLE>
<H2>Security-Related News Items from Security-Related Mailing Lists</H2>
by Mary Ellen Zurko, OSF Research Institute (zurko@osf.org)
<p>
This issue's highlights are from e$ and e$pam.
<p>
Privacy continues to get a lot of attention on the Net.  A Los Angeles
television reporter used the name of a convicted child killer, Richard
Allen Davis, and sent off a money order for $277 to the Metromail
Corporation, which is owned by publishing giant R. R. Donnelly & Sons
and is the nation's largest compiler and seller of consumer data.  The
reporter received a list of more than 5,000 children's names,
addresses, phone numbers and ages. One can imagine other sorts of
experiments targeting single women, gays and lesbians, and other
group whose members are targets of attacks by virtue of their group
membership.
<p>
Cookies are also getting their share of air time. Subscribers to
doubleclick.net put a request for a doubleclick cookie on their home
page, allowing doubleclick to collect statistics on visitors to their
subscriber base, and target advertising to those visitors, based on
other home pages they've visited.  A poster claimed that
www.privnet.com and the Internet Fast Forward netscape plugin for
Windows can selectively filter cookie transmissions to web servers (as
well as filtering out unwanted images, including but not limited to
advertisements).
<p>
The big news this month was NTT's announcement of an encryption chip
made in Japan (which therefore does not have the restrictions that
US-made crypto does). They did not have the licenses to sell RSA in
the US, but they're negotiating with RSA to get them.
<p>
A mailing list created by the US Federal Trade Commission to allow
interested parties to discuss the issues surrounding the privacy
interests of consumers visiting web sites. The address to subscribe to
it is PRIVACY-REQUEST@FTC.GOV. The discussion topic centers on whether
the FTC should regulate consumer web information.
<p>
There is also a new email list called hackerpunks, that is totally
anonymous. The subscription address is hackerpunks-owner@alpha.c2.org,
but only pseudonyms from @alpha.c2.org may subscribe and post to the
list.
<p>
Information warfare has also been getting a lot of attention. The
director of the CIA announced plans for a center concerned with "very,
very large" scale attacks to information infrastructures. In addition,
the London Times published a story about attacks on financial
institutions involving blackmailing and threats of suspended computer
service. None of the sources in the story were named.  
<p>
Drawing an analogy with encryption and US ITAR, a poster reported that
A piper is being taken to court for practicing on Hampstead Heath,
which has a bye-law forbidding music.  Mr Brooks, the piper, has
denied the charge. He claims he wasn't playing a musical instrument,
but practicing with a weapon. In 1746 in England, bagpipes were
declared to be instruments of war, not musical weapons, and a
subsequent Act of Parliament specifically stated that they were
weapons.
<p>
An article in the Financial Times discusses face recognition
technology. The state of Massachusetts is going to be using a system
based on work at MIT's Media Lab, to identify people using multiple
id's for fraud. The MIT work breaks up pictures of a face into pixels,
normalizes for factors such as distance and lighting, and selects
facial features that can most easily distinguish one face from
another.
<p>
A Florida bill
(<a href=http://www.scri.fsu.edu/fla-leg/bills/senate-1996/sb0942.html>
(http://www.scri.fsu.edu/fla-leg/bills/senate-1996/sb0942.html</a>) was
introduced that supports digital signatures as a form of legal
signature. While current laws do not preclude this use, the bill is
meant to further legitimize their use. 
<p>
On Java security, Sun announced that Java would implement SKIP (Simple
Key Management for Internet Protocol) for secure distribution of
applets.  SKIP is a sessionless key management protocol, and the
product of an IETF working group.
<p>
The International Cryptography Experiment (ICE) at
<a href=http://www.tis.com/crypto/ice.html>
http://www.tis.com/crypto/ice.html</a> is concerned with evolving
standards in CAPIs that promote international cryptography. 
<p>
Micropayments got a lot of discussion on several mailing lists, as
well as a list of their own. They're interesting from a security point
of view for their cost/security trade-offs. Each item needing
protection has a very small value, but the aggregation of the items
can turn into "real money."  A bunch of time has been spent discussing
just what is a micropayment (under $1 and above 1 cent seems to be the
consensus, although there are systems that can cover part of this
range in use already). Concerns about UI were raised (users don't want
to be bothered with small payments vs. users want control of their
money), as well as the economic impact of having to pay for what we
get free today.
<p>
There are few things I'd pay for that I get free today, but one of
them is e$pam. It's Bob Hettinga's write-only electronic commerce
channel, and it's where most of what I send to Cipher comes from. He's
living proof of many of his favorite issues; that reputation capital
can be built up, and that content selection is an increasingly
important service. The subscription address is
e$pam-request@intertrader.com. It puts out about 20 mail messages a
day. It covers the security aspects of electronic commerce, as well as
the economic theory, and everything in between.

<TITLE>Clinton creates Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection
</TITLE>
<p>
[15 July 1996] <br>
Executive Order 13010 of July 15, 1996<br>
Critical Infrastructure Protection<br>
<p>
"Certain national infrastructures are so vital that their incapacity or 
destruction would have a debilitating impact on the defense or economic 
security of the United States. These critical infrastructures
include telecommunications, electrical power systems, gas and oil 
storage and transportation, banking and finance, transportation, water 
supply systems, emergency services (including medical, police, fire,
and rescue), and continuity of government. Threats to these critical 
infrastructures fall into two categories: physical threats to tangible 
property (``physical threats''), and threats of electronic,
radio-frequency, or computer-based attacks on the information or 
communications components that control critical infrastructures 
(``cyber threats''). Because many of these critical infrastructures 
are owned and operated by the private sector, it is essential that
the government and private sector work together to develop a strategy 
for protecting them and assuring their continued operation." -- from
the Order.
<p>
E.O. 13010 goes on to establish a Commission on Critical Infrastructure
Protection, including both government and private sector representatives,
that will establish its objectives within 30 days, will identify
and consult with relevant parties concerned with "critical infrastructure
assurance issues", and will:
<ul>
<li> assess the scope and nature of the vulnerabilities of, and threats 
to, critical infrastructures;
<li>determine what legal and policy issues are raised by efforts to protect 
critical infrastructures and assess how these issues should be addressed;
<li> recommend a comprehensive national policy and implementation strategy 
for protecting critical infrastructures from physical and cyber threats and
assuring their continued operation;
<li>propose any statutory or regulatory changes necessary to effect its 
recommendations; and
<li>produce reports and recommendations to the Steering Committee as they 
become available; it shall not limit itself to producing one final report.
</ul>
<p>
The Commission is to be assisted by an Advisory Committee and will report to
the President through a Principals Committee.  A Steering Committee will 
approve the Commission's objectives and approve its reports.  The Order
charters the Commission for twelve months.
<p>
The Order also establishes an Infrastructure Protection Task Force (IPTF)
within the Department of Justice, chaired by the FBI, to "increase coordination
of existing infrastructure protection efforts in order to better
address, and prevent, crises that would have a debilitating regional or
national impact" while the commission conducts its analysis and before
the administration can act on its recommendations.  The IPTF is to
include at least one full-time member each from the FBI, the Department of
Defense, and the National Security Agency, and its function is to identify and
coordinate existing expertise, inside and outside of the Federal Government
to:
<ul>
<li>provide, or facilitate and coordinate the provision of, expert 
guidance to critical infrastructures to detect, prevent, halt, or confine 
an attack and to recover and restore service;
<li> issue threat and warning notices in the event advance information 
is obtained about a threat;
<li> provide training and education on methods of reducing vulnerabilities 
and responding to attacks on critical infrastructures;
<li> conduct after-action analysis to determine possible future threats, 
targets, or methods of attack; and
<li>coordinate with the pertinent law enforcement authorities during or 
after an attack to facilitate any resulting criminal investigation.
</ul>
<p>
Cipher readers may recall a report in EI#14 that suggested that the
Justice Department was pressing for a "Cyberspace Defense policy task
force" that would recommend policy within 12 months and a cyberspace
defense "entity".  E.O. 13010 appears to cast its net wider, in that
it addresses water and energy supply and distribution systems, 
transportation, emergency services, and continuity of government as well 
as telecommunications, banking, and finance.  The IPTF established
by the order could, perhaps, fill the role suggested in the earlier report.
<p>
The full text of E.O. 13010 is available from the U.S. Government Printing
Office at <a href=http://www.gpo.gov/su_docs/aces/aces140.html>

<TITLE>MLS Missing in MISSI?  Focus on Two-Level Security
</TITLE>
<p>
[15 July 1996] 
"We don't have the technology today that we ned to do pure MLS...
Quite frankly, today we have two-level MLS, Secret and Unclassified.  The
technology to do Top Secret down to the Internet is just not there,"
said Nicholas Piazzola, chief of the National Security Agency's 
Multilevel Information System Security Initiative (MISSI), according
to a report in <i>Government Computer News</i> by Paul Constance (July 15 
issue, p. 60).  The article reports that while MLS is still a long-term goal,
the MISSI program has adopted a "more pragmatic, risk management approach
focused on meeting the initial security needs of the Defense Message
Systems."  Three MISSI products are expected by the end of the year:
the Fortezza encryption card (see 
<a href=http://www.armadillo.huntsville.al.us/>
http://www.armadillo.huntsville.al.us/</a>),
a Fortezza/DMS compliant commercial firewall for
connecting Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) DMS networks to the Internet
(see <a href= http://mitten.ie.org:8000/>
http://mitten.ie.org:8000</a>,
and Secure Computing Corp.'s Secure Network Server, which is available now
(see <a href=http://www.sctc.com/>
http://www.sctc.com/</a>).
A future Fortezza is expected to include commercial encryption algorithms
such as DES and RSA.

<TITLE>British Physicians, System Developers Agree on Patient Psuedonyms
</TITLE>
<p>
By Ross Anderson
<p>
[21 June 1996] 
An agreement has been reached between the British Medical Association and
the UK's main providers of healthcare analysis information services - CHKS
Ltd (a subsidiary of HCIA Inc), the SEMA group, IMG and Reuters - to set
minimum standards for the de-identification of medical records. These
records are used in analysing hospital readmission rates, referral patterns
and casemix, and in epidemiological research generally.
<p>
Such studies require records of hospital care episodes to be linked, but
they should still not be identifiable to individuals outside the hospital
or other care provider (or else patient consent must be sought). A problem
had arisen in that some (though not all) healthcare information companies
had been identifying patients, and linking episodes, by their postcode and
date of birth. This combination is enough to identify over 99% of UK
residents.
<p>
It has therefore been agreed that in future, de-identified medical records
will not contain either the last two symbols of the postcode, or the day and
month of birth. Thus for example
<pre>
        CB5 9HF         15/09/1956
</pre>
<p>
will become
<pre>
        CB59            56
</pre>
<p>
This is sufficient information for age related casemix studies, and to
identify deprived areas. However, it is very rarely enough to identify
individuals; there are on average six individuals with each combination of
year of birth and postcode sector.
<p>
In order that episodes can still be linked, there will also be stored a
pseudonym for the patient such as a hospital number, practice number or
cryptographic hash function of the patient's name and date of birth (in
which case there will be a key unique to each provider).
<p>
This arrangement is not entirely sufficient for the secure handling of
health information - further access control and statistical security
measures are neededd to foil inferencing and other attacks. However it
brings the following immediate benefits:
<ol>
<li>    The threat to patient privacy is reduced by orders of magnitude.
        In prticular, the databases are no longer of value to banks,
        credit reference agencies, insurers and law enforcement;

<li>    The accuracy of the statistics is significantly improved. At
        present, figures such as hospital readmission rates are skewed
        by the correlation between ill health and frequent address changes.
        Using a pseudonym rather than the postcode as the primary key will
        enable systems to discount address changes within the same district
        hospital's catchment area;

<li>   The standards are in line with the existing guidelines of the
        Royal College of General practitioners and the General Medical
        Services Committee of the BMA, which state that no data may be sent
        outside a general practice without patient consent unless patients
        cannot be identified by persons external to the practice. This will
        enable data collected in primary care to be used together with the
        secondary care records, subject to any inference controls that may
        be needed.
</ol>
It should be noted that the use of pseudonyms in medical research and clinical
audit systems is well established in a number of countries, including Denmark,
Germany and New Zealand. Papers on the systems in use in the latter two
countries were given at the workshop on personal information held at Cambridge
on the 21st and 22nd June 1996.

<TITLE>Debate Continues on U.S. Cryptography Policy
</TITLE>
<p>
[16 July 1996] 
Following June 26 Congressional hearings on proposed legislation that 
would loosen restrictions on the use and export of cryptography, 
Vice President Gore proposed new policies on July 12, but, according to 
<i>New York Times</i> writer John Markoff (July 13, p.33), failed to gain much 
support for them from the computer industry, civil libertarians,
or privacy advocates.  The new policies anticipate the development
of a "global key management infrastructure" in which "trusted private
sector parties" would verify digital signatures and "hold spare keys
to confidential data" which could be obtained only by those who had
lost keys to their own data or "by law enforcement officials acting under
proper authority."
<p>
According to Gore's explanation of the policy, the administration would 
be willing to temporarily drop some restrictions on the export of strong 
cryptography in return for 
industry cooperation on key escrow "(e.g., investments in products that
support key recovery)".  Also under consideration 
are policies to permit the export of encryption using longer keys for 
use in health care and insurance applications.  Currently only financial 
institutions have such permission as a matter of policy, although 
permission for American firms to export strong cryptography for particular 
applications can be sought and approved on a case-by-case basis.
The full text of the announcement is available at 
<a href=http://www.cdt.org/crypto/960712_Gore_stmnt.html> 
http://www.cdt.org/crypto/960712_Gore_stmnt.html</a>; Gore's explanation
of the policy is available at
<a href=http://www.cdt.org/crypto/960712_Gore_expl.html>
http://www.cdt.org/crypto/960712_Gore_expl.html</a>.
<p>
Encryption and data security were also highlighted in the first
evening's broadcasts of the new Microsoft/NBC cable/Internet news
channel (MSNBC) on July 15.  Steve Walker of Trusted Information Systems
was interviewed and discussed encryption policy;  later New York
Times writer John Markoff and others discussed the arrest of
Kevin Mitnick.

<TITLE>Questionnaire on Practical Security Experiments
</TITLE>
by<br>
Erland Jonsson and Lech Janczewski
<p>
[9 July 1996]
<p>
To Teachers in Computer Security and other interested parties,
<p>
RE: Request for data on practical security experiments
<p>
At the last IFIP Security conference on Samos in May 1996 there was an
interesting discussion held on contents of data security
courses/lectures. During that discussion  the importance of experiments
in teaching this discipline was emphasized.  As "experiments" we
understand any action beyond "pure" lecturing encompassing such
activities as:
<ul>
<li>Analysis of various aspects of data security in real and laboratory   
  environment
<li>Development of new tools used for enhancing security of organisations,   
  systems or components.
</ul>
Experiments in this sense means both activities conducted during the
class presentations (DEMO), in laboratories (LAB), and in external
organisations (FIELD).
<p>
We decided to investigate this question in a more detailed way.  We
understand that without drawing on existing resources in this field our
effort would be fruitless.  Therefore, we would be very grateful if you
could answer the enclosed questionnaire.  It is an universal form good
for any type of experiment.  If during your data security courses you
have more than one experiment would you please use one form per
experiment.
<p>
We plan to complete the research within a couple of months so your
prompt action would be greatly appreciated.  We will reference any
material from you in our final report and we promise to send it to
you.
<p>
If you have any questions regarding this research will you kindly
contact any of us (address below).
<p>
Finally, if you feel that this message is not for you but rather for
someone of your colleagues, please forward this message to her/him.
<p>

<TITLE>LISTWATCH: Security List Items</TITLE>
<H2>Security-Related News Items from Security-Related Mailing Lists</H2>
by Mary Ellen Zurko, OSF Research Institute (zurko@osf.org)
<p>
This issue's highlights are from fv-users, www-security, sig-security,
risks, tbtf, ietf-tls, and e$pam.
<p>
The difference between technology-based controls and organizational
guarantees of privacy came up when Community ConneXion (C2) explicitly
posted the reasons why it would not accept First Virtual
payments. First Virtual (FV) attempts to explicitly document the pros
and cons of its use by sellers and buyers, and some of the reasons
given by C2 are old FV issues (buyers assume full risk of non-payment,
inappropriate for hard goods). The also cited the continuing issue of
whether or not FV is anti-cryptography (while FV publicly always
states that they support the implementation of usable crypto systems,
they are in a position to continually explain why their system should
be considered secure, particularly compared to systems that do use
crypto). However, the privacy issue they cite was new to me. It turns
out that a buyer's identity could easily be determined from her FV ID
(available in all transactions) through the use of finger.
<p>
CERT has put out yet another advisory warning people not to put
interpreters into their Web server's CGI bin directory.
<p>
A draft white paper on Clipper III has been leaked. One difference
seems to be the promise that any limit on encryption key length on
exports will be increased (or removed?) when escrow is used. 
<p>
The Java-bug hunters at Princetom found a bug in Netscape Navigator
2.02 that allows an applet to generate and execute arbitrary machine
code. Netscape has hired one member of the team for the summer. Other
holes announced by other people include the ability to read and write
the file system (under certain configurations), Trojan horse applets
that effect their servers, and learning the browser's launch path.
<p>
Various vendors, including IBM, Microsoft, and Novell, are announcing
plans to integrate Java into their OSes.
<p>
Now anyone can "see" where you live on the map, given your
address. Check out <a href=http://maps.yahoo.com/yahoo/>
http://maps.yahoo.com/yahoo/</a>. For some reason, I
find this really creepy, even though I know there's no new information
available here.
<p>
Becoming an international arms traffficker has never been so easy!
(Although some of us have long appreciated just how easy it can be
...) At <a href= http://online.offshore.com.ai/arms-trafficker/>
http://online.offshore.com.ai/arms-trafficker/</a>, clicking on a
button causes three lines of perl code to be sent to an ISP in
Antigua; the code implements a patented RSA encryption algorithm.
<p>
A new on-line privacy initiative, called the Internet Privacy
Coalition 
<a href=http://www.privacy.org/ipc/>http://www.privacy.org/ipc/</a>, 
is working towards the relaxation of laws banning the export of strong crypto.
<p>
A new IETF working group is working on Transport Layer Security. It's
rumored to be inspired by work in SSL and PCT. 
<p>
A member of the W3C team saw a demonstration of a successful
cryptanalitic attack against a slightly modified MD5 compressor
function. This attack allows an attacker to create a message that has
a given MD5 value.  Attacking unmodifed MD5 may merely be a matter of
CPU.  The demo'ed attack takes about 50 MIPS days.

<TITLE>NRC Cryptography Study To Be Released 30 May; Public Invited
</TITLE>
<p>
[31 May 1996] 
The long-awaited report by the National Research Council's Committee to
Study National Cryptography Policy was released yesteday at the National
Press Club in Washington, D.C.  The overview and recommendations 
from the report, entitled "Cryptography's Role in Security the Information
Society," are available at <a href=http://wwww.nas.edu/cstweb/28e2.html>
http://wwww.nas.edu/cstweb/28e2.html</a>.  Printed copies of the book
containing the report (about 500 pages in all) are expected to be
available in August, but the highlights, as summarized in the Washington
Post, 31 May, 1996, p. B3, are:
<ul>
<li>Federal policy should promote widespread commercial use of technologies that can prevent unauthorized access to electronic information.
<li>The government should allow ready export of cryptography products using 56-bit DES.
<li>The government's plan for promoting key escrow systems is premature.
<li>Debate about encryption policies should be conducted openly and does not require knowledge of classified information.
</ul>
Although the report stops short of recommending that all export controls on
cryptography be dropped, it generally resolves the argument between
restricting cryptography in order to assist law enforcement or promoting
cryptography in order to protect personal and corporate information against
espionage in favor of the latter.
<p>
The report was conducted at the request of Congress in order to 
inform debate on public policy for the use of cryptography.  Chairing
the study was Prof. Kenneth Dam, a former deputy Secretary of State
and now Professor of Law at the University of Chicago.  Also on the 16-member
committee were former Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti and
Leslie Gelb, President of the Council on Foreign Relations.  Among the
members of
the panel with ties to the cryptography, computer security and technology
communities included Martin Hellman of Stanford, Peter Neumann of SRI, 
Willis Ware of RAND, Ronald Graham of AT&T Bell Laboratories,
and Samuel Fuller of DEC.

<TITLE>GAO Reports DoD SBU Computer Security Inadequate
</TITLE>
<p>
[22 May 1996] Testifying before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee,
General Accounting Office (GAO) representatives Keith Rhodes and Jack Brock 
released a report criticizing security in DoD computer systems holding
sensitive but unclassified (SBU) information.  According to the testimony, 
the DoD estimated that these systems are subjected
to a total of about 250,000 "probes" each year, although this number
was acknowledged to be only a guess.  The testimony indicated that
about 65% of in-house attempts to penetrate these systems succeeded 
(a somewhat lower fraction than previously reported), 
that only a small fraction of these penetrations were detected, and that
a similarly small fraction of detected penetrations were reported.  
<p>
The report, entitled "Information Security:  Computer Attacks at Department 
of Defense Pose Increasing Risks," calls for improved training of system 
administrators and other measures to improve the security of these systems.  
It is be available from GAO as document AIMD 96-84, as an ASCII or Adobe
PDF file from the <a href=http://www.access.gpo.gov/su_docs/aces/aaces002.html>
US Government Printing Office WAIS server</a> (select GAO Reports and search 
for "[AIMD-96-84]" or "Information Security"), and as an Adobe PDF file 
at the <a href=http://www.gao.gov/>GAO web site</a>, currently in the
"New Reports" section, at <a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/ai96084.pdf">.

<p>
Jim Christy of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations described 
an intrusion in spring 1994 into the Air Force Rome Laboratory's
computer systems about two years ago by a 16-year old
UK youth known as "Datastream Cowboy," who was apprehended. Another hacker
involved, known as "Kuji," was never located.  The reported
cost of recovering from the intrustion was about $500,000.  Planned testimony 
by Cliff Stoll, Peter Neumann, and Robert Anderson was postponed when
committee members had to return to the Senate floor to vote.

<TITLE>Draft U.S. Cryptography Policy Paper Available on Web
</TITLE>
<p>
[22 May 1996] A draft paper from the U.S. Interagency Working Group on 
Cryptography Policy, entitled "Enabling Privacy, Commerce, Security and 
Public Safety in the Global Information Infrastructure" has been posted on the
Internet.  It discusses public key cryptography and the establishment
of Key Management Infrastructures (KMIs) to support certification of 
public keys.  Key escrow is discussed as a method to recover private
keys;  skeptics have already dubbed the proposal "Clipper III."
Cipher readers can find the full paper at

<TITLE> Letter to the Editor</Title>
To the Editor, <i>IEEE Cipher</i>:
<p>
Letter form a well-known reader (excerpted):
<p>
Carl,
<p>
I just want to let you know that lately I've been really appreciating
Electronic Cipher.  Over time I get more and more out of touch with security
happenings and people, and I've little time to spend in newsgroups and mailing
lists.  But I'm always interested in what's up the security world. and I've
found Cipher the most efficient and interesting way to do so.  Tell Mez (I
don't know her email address) that I particularly like her news highlights:
being written by a security person, they actually tell me what I want to know
(unlike newspaper articles) and I don't have to wade through mass quantities of
newsgroup chatter to get there.
<p>
If I had a wish, it would be to have someone write a highlights for the various
security conferences.  I know it's important to give an objective summary of
each paper, but it's too much for me to read all of them and I'm not capable of
judging which are truly "important" anyway  I read Science News every week and
trust their reporters to tell me what's important from scientific conferences
(and from journals).  It would be nice to have something like that for security
conferences, though I admit it might be hard to find someone you trust to make
the choices.
<p>
Keep it up!
<p>

<TITLE>Federal District Court Rules Source Code is Protected Speech</TITLE>
<p>
"For the purposes of First Amendment analysis, this court finds that
source code is speech." On this basis, U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall
Patel went on to refuse to dismiss Daniel Bernstein's suit against the
State Department, which had denied his requests to export the source code for
"snuffle", a cryptographic algorithm he developed.  According to the
Electronic Frontier Foundation, which is assisting Bernstein's
suit, this represents the first time a U.S. court has ruled that
source code is speech under First Amendment analysis, and as such
this represents a landmark ruling.  EFF sees this case as having the
potential to nullify the basis for NSA's control of cryptographic
software exports.  The case will proceed in Judge Patel's court,
the Northern District of California, in San Francisco. Full scanned-in
text of the decision available from the EFF 
<http://www.eff.org/pub/Privacy/ITAR_export/Bernstein_case/Legal/960415.decision> here</a>.

<TITLE>Cryptography Policy Items from All Over
</TITLE>
<p>
Bills to relax U.S. controls on the use and export of encryption were
introduced 5 March in both the House (Rep. Goodlatte, H.R. 3011, Security
and Freedom through Encryption Act) and Senate (Senator Leahy, S.1587,
Encrypted Communications Privacy Act of 1966). At this writing (28 April),
the House bill has attracted 37 co-sponsors; the Senate bill has only four,
but Senator Dole is one of them. The bills are not identical, but both would
relax U.S. export controls on encryption substantially and assure U.S.
citizens certain rights in the use of encryption. Neither bill has progressed
very far in the legislative process as yet.
<p>
According to the Internet Privacy Coalition, Senator Burns will introduce
his own bill, entitled Promotion of Commerce On-line in the Digital Era
(PRO-CODE), on April 30.  This is the legislation he announced at the
Computers, Freedom, and Privacy conference (Cipher EI #13).
<p>
In the past month, the ACM US Policy Board and IEEE US Activities Board
jointly wrote to Senator Burns as chairman of the Senate subcommittee with
cognizance over S. 1587 in support of relaxing export controls on
encryption, but suggesting that "we believe that the inclusion of issues
that are tangential to export, such as key escrow and encryption in
domestic criminal activities, is not necessary.  The relaxation of export
controls is of great economic importance to industry and users, and should
not become entangled in more controversial matters."
<p>
A <a href=http://www.cosc.georgetown.edu/~denning/crypto/Leahy.txt>
letter from Dorothy Denning to Sen. Leahy</a> was circulated widely on
the Internet this month.  She argues that his bill goes too far in removing
export controls and that international solutions based on the use of escrowed
encryption and CAPIs would be acceptable to business and government and should
be sought. Matt Blaze and Bruce Schneier had earlier written to Sen. Leahy
endorsing the legislation, though expressing concerns over the potential
interpretation of the bill's provision that criminalizes the use of
cryptography in the furtherance of a Federal felony.
The Schneier and Blaze letters are available at the 
<a href=http://www.privacy.org/ipc> Internet Privacy Coalition's web site</a>. 
<p>
Now that the "Blue Ribbon" campaign against the Communications Decency
Act is old news (though it's not over -- judges in a Philadelphia
courtroom were treated to lessons in how to find indecent materials
on the Internet this month, as the CDA trial continues), the Internet
Privacy Coalition (IPC), sporting a distinguished list of Founding Members
and a long list of Affiliated Organizations, has started a "Gold Key"
campaign to "to raise awareness and support for the preservation of the
right to communicate privately and the availability of new techniques
which make it possible." The IPC announced its formation and the campaign
on April 24.  <a href=http://www.privacy.org/ipc/> Details</a>.
<p>
According to a report in Inter@ctive Week, the Gartner Group has issued
a study arguing that
<blockquote>
 easily available encryption would quickly result in the dominance of a
 handful of encryption products worldwide, much like the market for
 other software. Once a mass market for cheap, easy-to-use security was
 established, the Gartner Group said, there would be little motivation
 for other companies to produce expensive, leading edge technologies,
 thus slowing the progress of encryption technology abroad as well as
 domestically. At that point, Gartner said, law enforcement could
 concentrate on cracking a handful of codes rapidly, instead of worrying
 about a wide variety of strong encryption technologies worldwide.
</blockquote>
<p>
A report from the UK indicated that its Department of Trade and Industry
(DTI) has received a study on information security featuring the key-escrow
approach and that ministers will decide on whether the UK will adopt
such a scheme in the next few months.

<TITLE>Macro Viruses Becoming Major Nuisance
</TITLE>
<p>
According to Information Week, a survey of 300 large corporations
by the National Computer Security Association (NCSA) showed that more
than 50% had suffered from macro-virus attacks during January and
February.  According to the report, Microsoft says its Virus Protection
Tool, available <a href=http://www.microsoft.com/> here</a>offers protection 
against the Word macro virus.

<TITLE>New U.S. Cyberspace Defense Panel?
</TITLE>
<p>
On the information warfare front, a Washington Technology Online article
by Neil Munro reports that U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno asked in
a March 14 memo that cabinet members create a national cyberspace defense
"entity" and establish a cyberwar defense policy task force.  The task
force, headed by a private sector presidential appointee and including
an advisory committee from the private sector, would recommend a
national cyberspace defense policy within 12 months.

<TITLE>Java and Security this month
</TITLE>
<p>
From CERT CA 96-17: Java bytecode verifier weakness:
<pre>
"The CERT staff recommends disabling Java in Netscape Navigator and not using
Sun's appletviewer to browse applets from untrusted sources until patches are
available from these vendors.
As we receive additional information relating to this advisory, we will
place it in   ftp://info.cert.org/pub/cert_advisories/CA-96.07.README"
</pre>
Later in the month, Daniel Abplanalp and Stephan Goldstein reported that
Java applets run under Netscape Navigator on a wide variety of platforms
can determine the pathname of the directory in which the Netscape Navigator
was started; this is considered a privacy/security violation.
On April 25, the NY Times reported that Windows 95 will soon include
Java support with its regular distribution.

<TITLE>Oracle Executive Successfully Repudiates E-mail
</TITLE>
<p>
The San Francisco Chronicle reported that instead of receiving a
$100,000 settlement for wrongful termination, a former Oracle employee
may now herself be prosecuted for sending false e-mail.  The e-mail in
question was ostensibly sent to her by her supervisor, but he was able
to show from cellular phone records that he could not have sent the
message at the time he was supposed to have done so because he was
driving his car at the time.  Further, the woman knew the passwords for
the account from which the mail originated.  One wonders whether
non-repudiation services for e-mail will be in regular use before
executives are routinely sending e-mail from their automobiles.

<TITLE> Letter from the Editor</Title>
Dear Readers,
<p>
Since our Valentine's Day issue, serious security flaws have been
reported in Kerberos 4, Java, JavaScript, and Microsoft's Internet
Information Server.  Los Alamos National Laboratory suffered an(other)
embarrassing intrusion when a hacker penetrated a firewall there.  But
Los Alamos was not alone; the Justice Department identified an
Argentinian youth as the intruder in a variety of U.S.  systems in the
last half of 1995 (his equipment had been confiscated at the end of
December).  The significance of this case seems to be that it is the
first time a wiretap warrant has been obtained on a telephone line
connected to a computer.  The warrant was needed because the system
being monitored did not provide a warning banner that its
communications might be monitored.
<p>
On the legislative front, while a legal challenge to the Communications
Decency Act (CDA) is underway in Philadelphia courtroom, a router
vendor is planning to market a product that would give Internet service
providers a tool for filtering all traffic sent to a given connection.
The White House has evidently received lots of e-mail, both legitimate
and spam, in the wake of the CDA.  Some anti-spamming software
installed on the White House mail system has evidently been put to good
use. Time Magazine technology writer Philip Elmer-Dewitt could use a
copy of it, as he fell victim to a similar assault.
<p>
New legislation to address the content of Internet communications,
cryptography use and export rules, and copyright are in various
stages of consideration in the U.S.  Most recently, Senator Burns of
Montana announced at the Computers, Freedom and Privacy conference that
he will introduce legislation to allow unrestricted export of mass
market or public domain encryption programs such as PGP and to
prohibit the imposition of mandatory key-escrow encryption policies on
the domestic market.
<p>
From Europe, reports are that Belgium may assume France's role as the
country most strictly controlling the use of encryption.  As France
seems ready to trade its policy permitting the use only of authorized
encryption schemes, for one that might only require that keys be
deposited with a to-be-specified trusted third party, Belgium turns out
to have passed a law over a year ago that includes constraints similar
to the former French ones.
<p>
On the electronic commerce front, American Express has joined Visa and
Mastercard in endorsing the SET specifications, which are now available
for downloading at <http://www.mastercard.com/set/set.htm>.  Digicash
teamed with European Internet service provider EUnet and Finland's
largest bank, Merita, to launch their ecash system.  Half a dozen
organizations, primarily media-related services, are reported
willing to accept ecash as payment. Oracle announced it will
collaborate with Verisign, incorporating Verisign Digital IDs in its
WebServer release 2.0 in order to provide cryptographically- based
authentication of parties to electronic transactions.  Cybercash
announced several new agreements as well.
<p>
Any questions?

<TITLE>LISTWATCH: Security List Items</TITLE>
<H2>Security-Related News Items from Various Mailing Lists</H2>
by Mary Ellen Zurko
<p>
Here are this month's highlights from www-security, libernet, tbtf,
risks, sig-security and e$pam.
<p>
There are guidelines around on how to write CGI programs so that they
don't allow a client to invoke arbitrary OS calls on the server
side. Adam Shostack has pointed out several times on www-security that
programs should check that only legal characters are used in user
input. However, another example of a CGI script that checks that no
_illegal_ characters were input has caused a CERT advisory. It's a CGI
example found in recent version of NCSA and APACHE httpd servers.
<p>

The Communications Decency Act is already having a chilling effect on
even the medium of print. Jim Warren, a journalist for BoardWatch (a
print and online magazine) has resigned over it. His editor excised an
intentionally crude reference from his column in both media. The
editor sent e-mail to Warren saying the change was made because it
could "deliberately implicate" the publisher in a felony.
<p>
It's been a big month for bugs in Java and Javascript. Javascript is
only related to Java by some syntactical overlap. It's not an open,
scrutinized standard, and it can be placed directly in an HTML
page. A Java bug that caused a lot of discussion this month involved
using DNS to subvert the restriction that an applet can only connect
to its originating host. The browser verifies this by doing a DNS
lookup on the name of the originating host to get the TCP address, and
comparing that address to a requested connection. However, a DNS name
can refer to more than one TCP address. There is no strong security on
DNS to make sure that a name only points to the "right" TCP address.
<p>
Javascript bugs were reported that allow script to monitor and
transmit the URLs that a browser visits and transmit the directory
listings of the local host file system.  A Javascript feature that has
raised some eyebrows is the ability to send mail under a user's name
when a form is submitted. The user can have no knowledge of the
content of the mail, or even that it was sent.
<p>
On 3/5/96 Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) introduced the Encrypted
Communications Privacy Act of 1996 in the Senate.  The bills would
waive export restrictions on "generally available" encrypting
software.  They would impose criminal penalties for the use of
encryption in the commission of a crime or to hide evidence of a crime.
<p>
An article in the Denver Post claims that CellPort Labs, Inc., has come
up with a device called MobileWeb that would allow users to browse
the web from their cars. From the article:
<blockquote>
Basically, MobileWeb links your vehicle's electronic devices via a
wireless cellular or personal communications service network to the
Web, [...]  "In essence, we're marrying the wireless service to the
automotive electronic system," Kennedy said.
</blockquote>
I find the idea of hooking my car up to the Internet pretty darn
scary.
<p>
A report on a location-based authentication method by Dorothy
E. Denning and Peter F. MacDoran outlines an authentication mechanism
that "utilizes space geodetic methods to form a time-dependent
location signature that is virtually impossible to forge."
<p>
Another public-key infrastructure working group has started in the
IETF (SPKI). This group has formed to explore public-key certificates
that are attribute-based instead of name-based, for use in a variety
of Internet applications.
<p>
The COAST Laboratory at Purdue discovered a vulnerability in the
pseudo-random number generating code of Kerberos V4 that allowed an
unprivileged user to impersonate another user. 
<p>
The Department of State now allows encryption software to be
temporarily exported for certain personal uses. 
<p>
China ordered all users of international computer networks to register
with the police.

Kerberos 4 keys not so random?
</H3>
<STRONG><BR>
</STRONG>
[23 February 1996]
Researchers at Purdue's COAST laboratory uncovered a significant weakness
in the Kerberos Version 4 key server, according to reports circulated
on 16 February.  CERT advisory CA-96.03, distributed 21 February, confirmed 
the problem, which concerns only key distribution centers, not clients or 
servers, and provided patch information.  According to the COAST announcement,
Steve Lodin and Bryn Dole, graduate students working with Prof. Gene Spafford,
<blockquote> discovered a method whereby someone without privileged
access to most implementations of a Kerberos 4 server can nonetheless
break secret session keys issued to users.  This means that it is
possible to gain unauthorized access to distributed services available
to a user without knowing that user's password. This method has been
demonstrated to work in under 5 minutes, on average, using a typical
workstation, and sometimes as quickly as 12 seconds.</blockquote>
The researchers also found that Kerberos Version 5 exhibited a
<blockquote>small, theoretical
weakness in Kerberos version 5 that would allow similar access, given
some additional information and considerable preliminary computation.
Kerberos version 5 does not exhibit the same weakness as described
above for Kerberos version 4.</blockquote>
Later reports gave the following timings for cracking session
keys: <br>
SPARC 5: average time to crack session key = 26.2 seconds (std dev 
14.7 over 223 trials); longest = 48.7 seconds;  shortest = .3 seconds.<br>
DEC Alpha: average time =  5.8 seconds with std dev of 3.3; longest =
10.9 seconds; shortest = .2 seconds.

[23 February 1996]
Two security flaws in recently released Java support were circulated 
on 18 February by Drew Dean, Ed Felten, and Dan Wallach of Princeton University.
A flaw in Netscape Navigator 2.0 and the 1.0 release of the Java Development
Kit from Sun permits a malicious applet to open a connection to arbitrary
Internet hosts; potentially permitting exploitation of bugs in any
TCP/IP-based network service (e.g. sendmail).  If the applet is executed
on a machine behind a firewall, machines on the same side of firewall
may be attacked in this way.  The second flaw occurs in the bytecode 
dissassembler, javap.   A long method name can overflow a stack allocated
buffer, potentially permitting arbitrary native code to be executed.
Both flaws can be avoided by disabling Java until patches are made available.
Dean and Felten will present a paper on security flaws in versions of Java 
and the HotJava browser at this year's 
<a href=http://www.itd.nrl.navy.mil/ITD/5540/ieee/cipher/SP96pgmandreg.html>
Oakland Conference</a>.  Details of a third serious flaw, reported
by the same group on March 23, are being withheld pending development
and distribution of appropriate patches.

The following report is excerpted from Lincoln Stein's WWW Security
FAQ files, found at <a href=http://www-genome.wi.mit.edu/WWW/faqs/wwwsf7.html>
<http://www-genome.wi.mit.edu/WWW/faqs/wwwsf7.html></a>.
JavaScript and Java share a common name and syntax, but they are quite
distinct entities.  Java is a language designed by Sun Microsystems.
JavaScript is a series of extensions to the HTML language understood
only by Netscape Navigator versions 2.0 (and higher). It's an
interpreted language designed for controlling the Netscape browser; it
has the ability to open and close windows, manipulate form elements,
adjust browser settings, and download and execute Java applets.
JavaScript holes all involve infringements on the user's privacy. The
following holes all exist in Netscape 2.01, and were discovered and
publicized by John Robert LoVerso of the OSF Research Institute
(loverso@osf.org):
<p>
1. JavaScripts can trick the user into uploading a file on his local hard
   disk or network mounted disk to an arbitrary machine on the Internet.
   Although the user must click a button in order to initiate the transfer,
   the button can easily masquerade as something innocent. Nor is there any
   indication that a file transfer has occurred before or after the event.
   This is a major security risk for systems that rely on a password file to
   control access, because a stolen password file can often be readily
   cracked.
<p>
2. JavaScripts can obtain directory listings of the user's local hard disk
   and any network mounted disks. This represents both an invasion of privacy
   and a security risk, since an understanding of a machine's organization is
   a great advantage for devising a way to break into it.
<p>
3. JavaScripts can monitor all pages the user visits during a session,
   capture the URLs, and transmit them to a host somewhere on the Internet.
   This hole requires a user interaction to complete the upload, but as in
   the first example the interaction can be disguised in an innocuous manner.
<p>
A description of these bugs can be found at:
   <a href= http://www.osf.org/~loverso/javascript/>
http://www.osf.org/~loverso/javascript/</a>
Netscape's version 2.01 browser permits the user to disable Javascript.

Microsoft's freely available Internet Information Server (IIS) software
shared a bug with other Windows NT browsers that permitted a malicious
user to cause arbitrary commands to be executed by the server.  A detailed 
description of the bug by Andy Baron is available at
<a href=http://www.omna.com/iis-bug.htm>http://www.omna.com/iis-bug.htm</a>.  Microsoft released a fix and a new
version of IIS; versions downloaded after March 5, 1996 are not
supposed to have the bug.  However, there is some disagreement over
whether or not the revised IIS is not in fact vulnerable to a similar,
but slightly more complex attack.  See

ITAR exemption for personal crypto use

<STRONG><BR>
</STRONG>
[23 February 1996]
U.S. citizens who want to take crypto products abroad with them on
trips may now find it a little easier than before.
The State Department has amended the International Traffic in Arms (ITAR) 
regulations to ease the burden on U.S. citizens
desiring to export cryptographic products temporarily for personal use, excluding
use for copying, demonstration, sale, re-export, or transfer of ownership
or control.  The traveler is required to keep the product secure by 
"locking the product in a hotel room, safe, or other comparably secure 
location; and, while in transit, the exporter keeps the product in 
his/her carry-on luggage or locked in baggage accompanying the exporter 
which has been checked with the carrier."  The policy does not apply to

Credit Cards on the Net: MasterCard, VISA Agree; First Virtual Attacks
</H3>
<STRONG><BR>
</STRONG>
[13 February 1996]
Healing an earlier split, MasterCard and Visa announced on February 1 
that they have agreed on a technical standard to allow secure credit card 
purchases over the Internet.  The specifications for the standard, called 
Secure Electronic Transactions (SET), are to be released in mid-February on 
the <a href=http://www.visa.com> Visa</a> and 
<a href=http://www.mastercard.com>  MasterCard</a> web sites.
Services based on the specification are 
planned to be available in late 1996.  Participants in the effort with 
MasterCard and Visa are: GTE, IBM, Microsoft, Netscape Communications Corp., 
SAIC, Terisa Systems and Verisign. SET will be based on specially developed 
encryption technology from RSA Data Security. 
<p>
As of 13 February, the specifications were not in evidence at either 
site.  In fact, the Visa site still included a press release from June 
1995 announcing that Visa and MasterCard were to cooperatively develop 
specifications that would be released in September 1995 leading to service 
in early 1996. 
<p>
Perhaps anticipating the 1 February announcement, First Virtual Holdings 
(FVH) announced in late January that it had developed a computer program
that could capture credit card numbers from unsuspecting computer users
prior to any software encryption and transmit them surreptitiously to a third
party via the Internet. FVH  [<a href=http://fv.com/>home page</a>] supports 
Internet electronic commerce through a scheme that avoids cryptography,
transmitting a customer's credit card information via a separate telephone 
call.  According to information released by First Virtual, the program
is designed to monitor user's keystrokes, recognize sequences that appear
to be credit card numbers (based on their known structure and redundancy),
and transmit the numbers tracelessly across the Internet.  It could be
distributed as a virus or Trojan horse.  Although FVH acknowledged that
the elements of this attack are well known, it claimed that the synthesis
of the elements was new.
<p>
Although this attack may not seem particularly innovative to Cipher readers,
the announcement naturally evoked a flood of e-mail responses from 
people interested in cryptography generally and from those with competing 
commercial interests.  Cipher readers interested in details from FVH's point 
of view should visit their 
web page: <a href="http://www.fv.com/ccdanger/"> 
http://www.fv.com/ccdanger/</a>.  
Olin Sibert provides a thoughtful commentary in the Risks forum, Vol. 17, 
Issue 69 (Feb. 7),(see URL:<a href=http://csrc.ncsl.nist.gov/rskforum/risks17.069> 
http://csrc.ncsl.nist.gov/rskforum/risks17.069</a>
which seems not to have found its way into the compendium of e-mail 
responses available at FVH's site.

Microsoft Crypto API Project Report
</H3>
<br>
by Matt Blaze, from posting to sci.crypt, 17 January 1996
<p>
<STRONG><BR>
</STRONG>
[14 February 1996]
I attended a meeting at Microsoft the other day at which they
described their Crypto API project.  As CAPIs go, it's reasonable
enough; nothing particularly exciting about it or especially wrong
with it (though they don't yet support nonblocking calls to crypto
modules).
<p>
They've defined 23 cryptographic services (establish key, encrypt,
etc.) that an application is expected to use for its cryptographic
needs.  The idea is to hide the crypto details (and keys) from
applications, and to make it easy to switch from, say, wimpy
export-approved crypto to good crypto just by switching to another DLL
at load-time.  The cryptography used depends on the crypto modules in
use at runtime.  The API will be part of the WIN32 interface.  The
next version of NT (and windows 95, I think), to be released in a few
months will support loading ``Cryptographic Service Providers'' (CSPs)
that contain the crypto functions that sit below the API.  They have
(or will have soon) an application development kit to allow you to
write code that uses the API, and a CSP development kit to let you
write the crypto functions.
<p>
The interesting part is that they say they've made a deal with the
government to allow applications that use the API to be exportable as
long as they don't also try to implement crypto on their own.
Ordinarily, the government claims that ``crypto with a hole''
(applications that call a crypto API) are just as export-controlled as
crypto functions themselves, so this is something of a surprise and
would represent considerable forward progress.  But, of course,
there's a catch.
<p>
The OS will not load just any old CSP.  CSPs have to be signed by
Microsoft.  The kernel contains a (hardcoded?) 1024 RSA public key
that it uses to check the signature when the user tries to load a CSP.
If the signature check fails, the CSP won't load.  Microsoft says it
will sign any CSP from anyone AS LONG AS THEY CERTIFY THAT THEY WILL
FOLLOW THE EXPORT RULES.  So you can get your CSP signed if you use
exportable cryptography or if you agree not to send it outside the US
and Canada, etc.  But an end user can't just compile crypto code and
use it as a CSP, even for his or her own use, without getting it
signed by Microsoft first (actually, the CSP development kit does
allow this, but it includes a special version of the OS kernel).
<p>
I'm not sure whether this whole thing is good or bad.  One important
issue is whether MS will really sign anyone's CSP or whether they will
start charging high fees or making business-based decisions on who's
CSPs they will allow (will they sign Netscape's CSP, for example).
They say they won't even look at or keep a copy of your CSP when they
sign it (at my suggestion, they are probably going to change the process
so that you send them a hash of your CSP instead of your CSP code when
you get the signature).  For now they promise to sign CSPs for anyone
who returns the export certificate, at no charge.  In any case,
the scheme attempts to put Microsoft, for better or for worse, in
control of the cryptography that gets used on their platforms.
<p>
We (Jack Lacy and I) will probably implement, get signed, and give
away a CryptoLib-based CSP (not for export) for which we will also
make source available so people can at least examine the source
to the crypto they use (most CSPs will, presumably, not include
source.  MS plans to include an exportable RC4-40/RSA512-based
"default" CSP with the OS).
<p>
Despite all this, I think it will be easy to get around the CSP
signature requirements and use homebrew, unsigned crypto even with
pre-compiled .exe files from other sources.  I suspect it will be easy
to write a program, for example, that takes an executable program
and converts CryptoAPI calls to calls that look like just another DLL.
And I'm sure someone will write a program to patch the NT/Windows
kernel to ignore the signature check.  Needless to say, it would be
nice if someone outside the US were to write and distribute programs
to do this.  It would also be nice if someone would write a Unix/Linux
version of the API/CSP mechanism.  It might make it possible to export
applications for those platforms as well.
<p>
I haven't tried any of this out yet, but they say they will have beta
versions of the API and CSP developers kits out in a few weeks.  They
say that the API kit will not be export-controlled but the CSP kit
will be.  They plan to announce all this at the RSA conference this
week.
<p>
<i>[The 29 January issue of INFOWORLD, p. 25, reported that the Microsoft
Crypto API would ship with the beta version of Windows NT 4.0 Workstation,
to be shipped in the first week of February.  The 22 January issue of
Government Computer News reported that the NSA had awarded a contract
under the MISSI program to Global Internet of Palo Alto, CA, to conduct a
feasability study on how Windows NT version 3.51 might be altered to
meet TCSEC B1 level requirements.  The study also includes developing
a prototype encryption card access control system based on Fortezza.
Completion of the study is scheduled for late 1996.

Case Closed on Zimmermann PGP Investigation

<STRONG><BR>

[14 February 1996]
According to reports published in the New York Times and Wall Street
Journal, William P. Keane, an assistant U.S. Attorney in San Jose,
announced on January 11 that, in consultation with the Justice Department
and other administration officials, he had decided to drop the
investigation of Philip Zimmermann.  This means that Zimmermann will
not be prosecuted for the export of PGP.  Zimmermann maintained
thoughout the investigation that he did not put the software on the
Internet.  The Internet Society's ISOC FORUM reported in its Vol. 2,
No. 2, that Michael J. Yamaguchi, U.S. Attorney for the Northern
District of California, announced that his office has declined
prosecution of any individuals in connection with the posting to
USENET in June 1991 of PGP.  Both Keane and Yamaguchi have declined
comment on the reasons for dropping the case and have cautioned
against inferring policy decisions from these events.

[14 February 1996]<br>
From the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, January 18, 1996, p. B7:
<blockquote>
IBM has agreed to provide the U.S. government with a special key that
would enable government agents to more easily decode electronic messages,
in exchange for permission to export a version of Lotus Notes that
includes 64-bit security.  The arrangement provides government officials
with a key to the first 24 bits of security code, meaning that they only
have to crack the remaining 40 bits to decrypt a message.  U.S. Notes
customers already use a 64-bit system.  "We were desperate enough to try
to negotiate a short-term, pragmatic solution," says Notes developer
Ray Ozzie.  "But we do not believe this is the right long-term solution...
Our customers have been telling us that, unless we did something about
the security, we could no longer call it a secure system."
</blockquote>
[In late December 1995, Integrated Computing Engines, Inc. (ICE) of Cambridge,
Mass., reported that it had cracked a 40-bit DES encryption key in
less than 8 days using a single $83,000 computer. See also the

The Business Software Alliance, an industry organization devoted to
preventing software piracy, hired Matt Blaze, Whitfield Diffie, Ron L.
Rivest, Bruce Schneier, Tsutomu Shimomura, Eric Thompson and Michael
Wiener to provide an estimate of the key lengths needed to protect
commercial information under symmetric ciphers.  The group's  answers?
"keys used to protect data today should be at least 75 bits long.
To protect information adequately for the next 20 years in the face of

[14 February 1996]
Stewart Baker, former General Counsel of the National Security Agency
and now of the law firm of Steptoe and Johnson, has written a
detailed and readable account of a recent international meeting of
cryptography experts and policymakers.  The complete, copyrighted
report is available at: 
<a href="http://www.us.net/~steptoe/276908.htm">
[http://www.us.net/~steptoe/276908.htm]</a>
The first paragraph of the report's summary reads as follows:
"The OECD's ad hoc meeting of experts on cryptography was the brainchild
of U.S.  policymakers.  Export controls on encryption have increasingly
been attacked as unworkable by U.S. software and hardware producers,
who see a major market for security on the global information
infrastructure.  This need, they argue, will be met by foreign producers
if U.S.  export controls are kept in place.  Many companies in the
software business have also attacked the latest Administration proposal
allowing the export of strong encryption only if it incorporates some
form of key escrow.  These companies question the international demand
for key escrow."

<TITLE>LISTWATCH: Cypherpunks, www-security, and tbtf by Mary Ellen
Zurko</TITLE>
<H3>WWW Security News from Cypherpunks, WWW-Security, and TBTF</H3>
by Mary Ellen Zurko
<p>
This month's WWW security news comes from cypherpunks (via Robert
Hettinga's reposting service), www-security, and tbtf (Tasty Tidbit
from the Technology Front).
<p>
Students at Berkeley showed how they could patch NFS binaries to
disable security in programs like Netscape. They pointed out that
endpoint security (the security of desktop machines) is just as
critical to Internet security as secure protocols for transmission.

<p>
Community ConneXion (<a href="http://www.c2.org/">
http://www.c2.org/</a>), an Internet ISP specializing
in privacy, has added ecash and Java to its bounty list. They will
provide a T-shirt to anyone who hacks the electronic cash system
announced by Digicash bv and Mark Twain Bank (which, by the way, they
also accept as payment for their services, offering a 5% discount for
such payments). The Java promotion covers anyimplementation of Java
(including Netscape's), as well as HotJava, Sun's Java-enabled
browser. The Hack Java promotion was inspired by two bugs found in the
alpha release of HotJava, one of which allowed applet's to set the
browser's proxy, thereby allowing the adversay unlimited access to the
browser's HTTP interactions. Digicash and Java join Netscape and
Microsoft on C2's list. C2 is dedicated to enhancing the level of
security available on the Internet through these promotions.
<p>
Mondex, which is producing stored-value smart cards for electronic
commerce, is under fire. They have promoted this debit card as privacy
friendly, anonymous, and cash-like. However, the project manager is
quoted as saying that Mondex uses a full audit trail of all
transactions. Promotional material claims this information is only
available to the card holder. The complaint is at <a href="
http://www.privacy.org/pi/activities/mondex/complaint.txt">
http://www.privacy.org/pi/activities/mondex/complaint.txt</a>. 
<p>
I was pleased to see someone on cypherpunks gush over "Network
Security - PRIVATE Communication in a PUBLIC World" by Charlie
Kaufman, Radia Perlman, and Mike Speciner, the way I do. It's a very
well-written book, intuitive and lucid about all it's topics,
including cryptographic protocols.
<p>
DejaNews (<a href="http://dejanews.com">
http://dejanews.com</a>)</a> archives Usenet postings, and offers a
"sophisticated system for retrieving 'author profiles' of the
individuals who have posted messages." People who believe that it is
an invasion of privacy are finally understanding what kind of
information can be put together out of public postings.
<p>
With so much emphasis on confidentiality and authentication in
Internet stories, it was good to see one with an emphasis on security
auditing. Keith Dawson of tbtf posted a description of a Windows 95
security hole. He pointed out that machines connected full time to the
Internet (without the protection of firewalls) are vulnerable to a
feature that makes local drives available as network drives. Drives
can be password-protected, but the combination of a lack of auditing
and the fact that most humans don't choose passwords well shows that
this feature offers little real security.

A bug in Netscape's second beta version of their LiveScript facility
(their licensing of the Java technology) allowed an applet to send a
list of all the URLs a browser had visited to any server that the same
browser visits. Information sometimes stored in URLs includes the
parameters to a search engine request.

Visa, Microsoft, and Spyglass announced a project to support credit
card shopping on the World Wide Web, where Visa has agreed to cover
losses if the software fails. I hope someone is transferring
high-assurance software engineering techniques to this effort.

<H3>Timing Channel Threatens RSA Security</H3>
<STRONG><BR>
</STRONG>
[11 Dec. 95] The <CITE>New York Times </CITE> reported that Paul Kocher,
a 22-year-old researcher who has worked as a computer security consultant
to several major software companies, has identified a significant attack
on the secuirty of the RSA public key encryption algorithm.  From the
perspective of many Cipher readers, the attack is of particular interest
because it explits an inadvertent covert timing channel in the execution 
of the RSA algorithm.  Such covert timing channels have been a concern to
researchers for years, but they have typically been dismissed as 
insignificant by most commercial vendors and, indeed, by many within the
INFOSEC community.  The idea behind the attack is that by observing
closely the time it takes for the software executing the algorithm to
complete the many multiplications it requires, one can deduce significant
information about the factors involved in the multiplication, thereby
greatly limiting the size of the space that needs to be searched
to find the key.  Details are available in a <a href="951211.PKmsg.html">
message to the Cypherpunks mailing list</a> and in <a href=
"http://www.cryptography.com"> a web page by Kocher</a>.  RSA Security
<a href="http://www.rsa.com/rsaqa.htm">
responded</a> that the vulnerability could be closed, either by 
padding the multiplication times or by randomizing them through a
technique called "blinding".  Evidently neither of these techniques is
in place in current RSA implementations.

<BODY>
<H3>Weak Password Encryption Exposed in Windows '95</H3>
<STRONG><BR>
</STRONG>
[13 December 1995] The Automated Systems Security Incident Support Team
(ASSIST) announced that Microsoft's implementation of a stream cipher
encrypting algorithm for PWL files has produced an easily broken
encryption.  The report was prompted by the release on the Internet of
software that could break this encryption. The .PWL files contain
Windows 95 Resource passwords, including access information for remote
hosts.  Resources possibly affected by passwords in .PWL files include,
but are not limited to, the following:
<ul>
   <li> Password-protected folders, directories, or printers for any
     accessible Windows 95 system.
   <li> Remote computers accessed either through the network, or
     other access techniques (i.e., ftp, telnet, Kermit, etc. ).
   <li> Windows NT computers that do not participate in a domain,
     or the Windows NT logon password if the NT system is not
     the Primary Network Logon Server.
   <li> NetWare Servers.
</ul>
In response, Microsoft has released an updated security component to upgrade
the encryption used; see URL

<H3>US Telecommunications Reform Legislation Nears Passage, Stirs Protest</H3>
<STRONG><BR>
</STRONG>
[21 December 1995] Telecommunications Reform legislation emerged from
the House - Senate conference committee ready for final passage by both
houses and signature by the President.  Despite some backlash among
Republican legislators apparently created by Vice President Gore's
favorable comments on the bill, it appears likely that the bill will be
passed and signed by President Clinton in its current form.  The bill
includes penalties for transmitting "indecent" material over
telecommunication networks such as the Internet, and this language has
sparked considerable protest among some groups.  Several of these
called for a "National Day of Protest" to be held on December 12, and
newspapers carried reports of demonstrations in San Francisco and
elsewhere.  Proposals made in conference to change the "indecent"
standard, criticized as vague and potentially unconstitutional, to a
more narrow and legally well-established standard of information
"harmful to minors" did not garner sufficient support to alter the
final bill.

<H3>Privacy International Releases "Big Brother Incorporated"</H3>
<STRONG><BR>
</STRONG>
[4 December 1995] 
Privacy International, a London-based non-profit,
non-government organization, has released a 150-page report entitled
"Big Brother Incorporated:  a report on the international trade in
surveillance technology and its links to the arms industry."  According
to a media release, the report shows how technology companies in Europe
and North America provide the surveillance infrastructure for police
and military authorities in countries such as China, Indonesia, Nigeria,
Angola, Rwanda and Guatemala.  The report's primary concern is the flow
of sophisticated computer-based technology from developed countries to
developing countries, and particularly to non-democratic regimes. Privacy
International was formed in 1990 and brings together privacy experts,
human rights advocates, and technology experts in more than 40 countries,
working toward the goal of promoting privacy issues worldwide. A summary
of the report is available at <http://www.privacy.org/pi/reports/big_bro>;

<H3>TCSEC C-Level Security Considered &quot;Excellent&quot;</H3>
<BR>
<BR>
[Nov. 13, 1995] As part of a comparison of three major PC operating systems, <CITE>INFOWORLD</CITE>
 provides an interesting mapping from their notion of security to the  the Trusted 
Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC) levels.  The product comparison of Windows 
95, Windows NT 3.1, and OS/2 Warp Connect, Version 3 included an assessment of security provided by each in terms of the access available to it when operated as an individual 
workstation (not as the server end of a peer-to-peer connetion).  A table accompanying 
the ratings included the following correspondence between word scores and security ratings:<BR>
<STRONG><BR>
</STRONG>

<H5>Security Rating / Word score</H5>
<BR>
None / Unacceptable<BR>
Minimal / Poor<BR>
Low / Satisfactory<BR>
Moderate / Good<BR>
High / Very Good<BR>
TCSEC class C / Excellent<BR>
TCSEC class B / Excellent<BR>
TCSEC class A / Excellent<BR>
<BR>
<CITE>INFOWORLD</CITE>
 described its testing procedure as follows:  <BR>
<BR>
<blockquote>
We assessed and configured each operating system's security based on its default 
installation options.  We created users and implemented a security policy on those 
OSes that offered some form of security.  The policy was as restrictive as possible 
wihout hindering the capabilities of applications.  We simulated users logging in to the 
system either as a peer-to-peer workstation or as a client ot NetWare 4.10.
<p>
Users fell into three classes:  super-users (or administrators), targets, and hackers. 
 The hackers attempted to change or delete the target user's workstation.  At a minimum, 
we expected the OSes to provide rudimentary security features.  We lowered a product's score if we could in any way modify the environment of the target users or 
were able to gain either information or indirect access to information about the 
target users.
</blockquote>
Features considered in the ratings, as listed, were passwords, unique IDs, access 
control by owner, access control by owner/group/world to directories, and access 
control by owner/group/world to files.  A product providing all these features would 
apparently be labeled &quot;High&quot; for security unless it also was found to contain security holes.<BR>
<BR>
The results, in brief:  
<H5>OS2/Warp Connect, Version 3</H5>
 Poor -- aside from a simple desktop password, there is no security mechanism within 
OS/2 Warp.  
<H5>Windows 95</H5>
Poor:  Windows 95 security should only be used as a deterrent to accidental damage. 
 The operating system can't stop a determined hacker. 
<H5>Windows NT Workstation 3.51 </H5>
 Excellent. Windows NT offers government C2-level security with unique user IDs, token 
control, and advanced auditing capabilities.

<H3>NSA NCSC to Push EPL Marketing, Commercial Evaluations; 
IBM AS/400 rated C2 </H3>
<STRONG><BR>
</STRONG>
[13 Nov. 95] NSA's 
National Computer Security Center plans to raise the profile of its Evaluated Products 
List (EPL), according to an article by Paul Constance in <CITE>Government Computer News (GCN).  </CITE>
The article displays a snappy new logo that evaluated products will be able to display 
and reports that the NCSC plans to make the EPL available on the World Wide Web. 
 Because it has only five NSA evaluators and sixty from federally funded R&amp;D centers 
such as MITRE and Aerospace, NCSC will also become more selective about the products 
it chooses to evaluate, focusing on &quot;market-leading operating systems and database 
software that meets industry standards for open, networked architecture and popular 
graphical interfaces,&quot; rather than accepting all products vendors offer for evaluation.  At 
the same time, NCSC is cooperating with the National Institute for Standards and 
Technology (NIST) to study the feasibility of accrediting commercial laboratories 
to perform for-profit assessments of products up to the B1 level.  An accreditation process 
could be in place as early as 1997, according to Dennis Kinch, chief of the NCSC's 
Trusted Product Evaluation division.  <BR>
<BR>
A news item in the same issue of <CITE>GCN </CITE>
reports that IBM's AS/400 has received a C2 rating after more than three years of 
testing.  The rating applies to AS/400 D, E, and F models which are available in 
special government configurations, although they are no longer in general production. 
 An IBM representative said that the rating could apply to the current F-10 model if it runs 
OS/400 Version 2, Release 3.  The rating also extends to the DB2 database for OS/400, 
according to the item.

[8 Nov. 95]<CITE> </CITE>
Bell Atlantic reported that its voicemail system, Answer Call, had indeed routed messages 
to the wrong mailboxes and attributed the problem to new software in its Arlington, 
Virginia voice mail center, according to a <CITE>Washington Post</CITE>
 article by Mike Mills on November 8.  The problem was originally reported by the 
<CITE>Post </CITE>
 on Oct. 31;  at that time Bell Atlantic reported that the problem was corrected when 
they rebooted the system.  Although the original report carried an estimate that 
such errors were &quot;a one in a million shot,&quot; the system has, in fact, 1.5 million 
subscribers, and the original article triggered eight additional reports of similar malfunctions 
from Northern Virginia residents.  A church organist reported receiving several messages 
intended for others over a period of a month, including one from a defense contractor detailing plans to bid on a federal project.  In the November 8 article, Paul 
Miller of Bell Atlantic reported that the problems occurred when new software at 
the Arlington voice mail center &quot;reacted poorly&quot; with another program that checks 
to make sure voice messages are correctly routed.  He said that the source of the problem 
had been identified and corrected.

<TITLE>PeopleSoft security flaws reported, corrected</TITLE>
PeopleSoft 5.0 contains includes several security weaknesses, 
according to an article by Barb Cole in the 6 November issue of Network World.  
The problems include storing unencrypted passwords on users' desktops 
in Windows memory, passing unencrypted passwords over the network, and  
storing a master identification providing access to advanced network privileges
on Windows clients where it could be found by hackers.  PeopleSoft, described
as the No. 3 vendor of client/server applications, provides a suite of
pre-built financial, distribution, and human resources applications.
The flaws were reported earlier by First Albany Corp.-META Technology Research,
according to Network World.  Patches to reduce the vulnerability of passwords
stored on the client side are included in PeopleSoft 5.0.1, now available.
Changes planned for early 1996 will encrypt passwords sent over networks.
<p>
A subsequent article by Ilan Greenberg in the 13 November issue of 
<i>INFOWORLD</i> reported that the 5.0.1 release indeed solves this particular
problem.  The article reports that PeopleSoft plans to incorporate
Open Horizon, Inc.'s desktop security technology (including Connection
Security Module, for better encryption and authentication of passwords), 
directly into PeopleSoft's applications by next March.  Representatives of
competing products from Oracle and Hyperion Software Corp. said their 
products were not subject to the kinds of security holes that had troubled
the PeopleSoft product, according to <i>INFOWORLD</i>.

Autumn is a busy season for our TCSP.  Here are a few dates to 
remember:
<p>
o Reviewers needed for Computer Security and Privacy Glossary
<p>
IEEE is preparing a Glossary of Terms under IEEE Standards Project 
P610.  The Glossary on Security and Privacy Project, P610.9, requests 
volunteers from our TC on Security and Privacy to provide expert review 
during the month of November 1996.  The Glossary has 19 Keyword Groups 
covering about 500 terms.  Volunteers are needed to review one or more 
of the Keyword Groups.  For more information on this effort and the 
IEEE Point of Contact, see Reviewers Requested for IEEE Standard P610.9 
in this issue of Cipher.  Do not send requests to Cipher or the TCSP 
Officers.

From time to time, the IEEE updates the Technical Committee (TC) 
membership database and culls old records.  To remain in our database 
of TCSP members, you must submit a membership application to IEEE 
Computer Society  by December 31 of this year.  If you have not already 
done so, please complete and submit the membership application in this 
issue of  Cipher (How To Join the TC on Security and Privacy), or at 
http://www.computer.org/tab/tcapplic.htm.  Send  your applications to 
the IEEE Computer Society  (and not to Cipher or the TCSP Officers).  
Our TCSP no longer keeps its own membership list so we need you to 
register with IEEE Computer Society in order to keep our membership 
list current and complete.
<p>

<TITLE> Letter from the Editor</Title>
Dear Readers,
<p>
Welcome to Bob Bruen, who has agreed to edit Cipher's previously
dormant book review section.  In this issue he contributes reviews
of two recent books on network security, and I am hoping for more
reviews in future issues.  If you have books to suggest, or you
would like to assist him, you can write him at bruen@mit.edu.
<p>
Here are a few news tidbits that I didn't have time to include
as full stories:
<p>
US non-counterfeitable Social Security Card studies:  the Welfare
Reform Bill of 1996, now enacted as P.L. 104-193, directs the
Commissioner of Social Security to develop a prototype counterfeit-
resistant social security card that will be:
<ul>
<li> (A) be made of a durable, tamper-resistant material such as plastic
     or polyester,
<li> (B) employ technologies that provide security features, such as
     magnetic stripes, holograms, and integrated circuits, and
<li> (C) be developed so as to provide individuals with reliable proof
     of citizenship or legal resident alien status.
</ul>
<p>
Prompted by a lawsuit filed by the ACLU against the state of Georgia,
which has passed a law imposing criminal penalties on certain kinds of
Internet communications, including some kinds of anonymous messages,
the Washington Post noted editorially that 11 states have passed
statutes restricting "Internet behavior" and wondered exactly who
is covered by these laws -- people within the particular states?
all traffic passing through them?  The editorial hypothesized that
the more local legislation is passed, the stronger will be the
demand for anonymous remailers.
<p>
Crypto policy debates and activities:  although several major companies
agreed to get on board with the administration's Key Recovery
program, others resisted.  As of this mailing, no actual Executive
Order has been released that would implement the announced policy,
but it has been reported that the administration will name an
official who will have the responsibility for marshalling international
support for the policy.  Japan announced that, under the Wassenaar
Arrangement on Export Controls (successor to COCOM), it would lower
the threshold above which government approval for crypto export
orders is required from the previous $91,000 to about $450.
The Internet Architecture Board and the Internet Engineering Steering
Group protested the key recovery plan, saying that any type of
escrow system would "inevitably weaken the security of the overall
cryptographic system, by creating new points of vulnerability
that can and will be attacked... Sound cryptographic practice
dictates that users never reveal their private keys to anyone, even
a certification authority." The White House has asked the Federal
Networking Council Advisory Committee to come up with recommendations
on information security issues, including the key recovery plan.
<p>
A Draft Treaty on Intellectual Property in Respect to Databases,
prepared under the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)
drew considerable comment and criticism.  The primary concern seems
to be that scientific and technical data currently available to
researchers without charge under fair-use exemptions may, under
the proposed treaty, become accessible only via databases that
charge for every access.  Further information, including a copy
of a letter from the heads of the National Academy of Sciences,
National Academy of Engineering, and the Institute of Medicine
to the Secretary of Commerce is available at
<a href="http://ksgwww.harvard.edu/iip/intellec.html">
http://ksgwww.harvard.edu/iip/intellec.html</a>
<p>
Thanks to the many contributors whose names you will find throughout
the issue; they have been so generous this month that I won't take up
any more space here, except to urge all Cipher readers to keep the
contributions coming.

<TITLE>
Report on DIMACS Workshop on Trust Management
</TITLE>
<H2>Report on DIMACS Workshop on Trust Management</H2>
</H3>by Clifford Kahn, The Open Group Research Institute 
(ckahn@opengroup.org)</H3>
<p>
The DIMACS Workshop on Trust Management in Networks was held in 
South Plainfield, NJ from 9/30/96-10/2/96.  

<p>
Trust management is authentication and access control.  The conference
organizers say that those two standard concepts need to be lumped
together.  They say applications don't want to know the name of the
remote principal.  Applications just want to know whether the remote
principal is OK, authorized, trusted.
<p>
There are no proceedings.  Abstracts can be found at
<a href="http://jya.com/dimacs.txt">
http://jya.com/dimacs.txt</a>

<H3>GENERAL SECURITY SYSTEMS</H3>
<p>
Four general security systems were debated at the conference.  I will
describe them, then review the big debates.  They are:<br>
a) Simple Distributed Security Infrastructure (SDSI)<br>
b) PolicyMaker<br>
c) Simple Public Key Infrastructure (SPKI)<br>
d) X.509v3<br>

<H3>X.509v3</H3>
<p>
Steve Kent (BB&N) presented. 
<p>
The central concern of X.509 is authentication, not access control.
X.509 is an ISO standard, part of the X.500 Directory series.  A
principal has a global name, like:
<p>
  C=US  O=The Open Group  OU=RI  CN=Clifford Kahn
<p>
X.509 certificates bind public keys to names.  The X.509 standard does
not say what trust to extend to each introducer, or "certification
authority".  But in the culture surrounding X.509, there is much
reliance on a few well-known and trusted introducers--global
certification authorities.
<p>
[Another model with some good properties is roughly: trust your own
ancestors and the other principal's ancestors as introducers.]
<p>  
X.509 is widely deployed.  NetScape, Internet Explorer, Secure
Electronic Transactions (SET), etc.  X.509v3 provides for extensions,
which can be used for authorization purposes.  A certificate could,
for example, designate someone as an officer of a corporation.


<H3>Simple Distributed Security Infrastructure </H3>
<p>
SDSI is a proposal by Butler Lampson (Microsoft) and Ron Rivest (MIT).
Lampson presented.
<p>
SDSI provides for both authentication and access control.  A group can
consist of any set of principals--one from this company, three from
that university.  Groups can be defined as intersections and/or unions
of other groups.
<p>
Principals have names, generally.  (Anonymous access is also
possible.)  Each principal defines its own name space for principals
it knows about.  This name space can contain symbolic links to other
peoples' name spaces.  The consensus at the conference was that if
principals were going to have names, SDSI had the right approach to
names.
<p>
A principal can certify only names in its own name space.  This is
similar to the "only trust ancestors" rule.
<p>
SDSI certificates have meanings expressible in English, a valuable
rule so that humans can know what they are signing.
<p>
In SDSI each certificate states its own revocation policy. 
<p>
SDSI is "an artful combination of well established ideas," says
Lampson.
<p>
Two implementations are due later this year. 


<H3>PolicyMaker</H3>
<p>
PolicyMaker is work of Matt Blaze, Joan Feigenbaum, and Jack Lacy
(AT&T Laboratories).  Blaze presented.
<p>
A certificate contains an executable program, a boolean function
OK(A).  A is an app-specific description of the action requested.  If
the keys match, the function is called.  The function must be in a
safe language.  Right now that language is awkward, a safe version of
awk.
<p>
The function can impose authentication rules.  Examples: <br>
- There can be only k introducers in a chain.  <br>
- The principal must be vouched for by at least two independent 
	  chains of introducers.
<p>
The function can make application-specific checks.  Example: Yes if
it's under $500.
<p>
How real users control access to their resources with PolicyMaker is
"an open question".  
<p>
PolicyMaker is available and is being used by researchers, who love
its flexibility.


<H3>Simple Public Key Infrastructure</H3>
<p>
SPKI is a draft IETF standard, being led by Carl Ellison (CyberCash).
Ellison presented.
<p>
SPKI has no names, in general.  A certificate declares that a key's
holder is allowed to do a particular thing.  Examples:<br>
- telnet into a particular account on a particular host<br>
- read a certain directory and everything in it 


<H2>BIG DEBATES</H2>
<p>
Should we identify a principal by name or by key? 
<p>
Should certificates be programs? 
<p>
Should we use X.509 or not? 


<H3>Identify Principal by Name or Key?</H3>
<p>
Claim: An application doesn't want to know the name of the requestor.
An application wants to know whether the requestor is allowed to do
what it is asking to do.  The security subsystem should answer that
question.  Names are beside the point.  (This is the position of
Blaze, Feigenbaum, and Lacy, among others.)
<p>
What of security management?  When granting someone access, should we
identify them by name?  Names are ambiguous.  To resolve the
ambiguity, you have to go out of band.  If you're going out of band
anyway, why not transmit a key out of band?  So runs the argument.
<p>
Ellison's view: before granting someone access, you should
authenticate them in person and get their public key.  Ellison works
for CyberCash.  It was observed that even credit card companies don't 
do what he recommends, much less publishers granting access to a 
document, etc.
<p>
Steve Kent's view: when you use account numbers as names, there is no
ambiguity.  Forget having a single name for each person.  "Let a
thousand CAs bloom."
<p>
Lampson's view: you need names for auditability.  People need to be
able to check whether the access controls are right.  


<H3>Should Certificates Be Programs? </H3>
<p>
Lampson: "The whole point of the security framework is to abstract
drastically down from the full complexity of the application."  With
PolicyMaker, nobody will understand the security system.  Specialized
checks should be in the application, not in the certificate. 
<p>
Q: When a resource owner wants to grant someone access in PolicyMaker,
what does he/she do?  Write a program?<br>
A (Blaze): It's an open question. <br>
    - Template policies?<br>
    - A GUI for building these programs graphically? <br>
And: "I'm not concerned with whether the average COBOL programmer can
produce certificates."  Much less with whether the end user can do
so, apparently.


<H3>X.509 or Not? </H3>
<p>
Anyone who thinks principal names are useless thinks X.509 is useless.
<p>
That aside, X.509 notation is really ugly, hard to generate and
decode.  On the other hand, X.509 is widely deployed.  In practice its
cumbersomeness can be hidden from users and mostly from programmers.
There is a big problem only if (as Ellison observes) one is trying to
process X.509 certificates in a very small processor, such as a smart
card.  SPKI is designed to accommodate such small implementations. 


<H2>SOME OTHER TOPICS</H2>
<p>
I don't cover every talk, just a selection. 


<H3>Trust Management in Web Browsers, Present and Future</H3>
<p>
Ed Felten (Princeton University)
<p>
What can the user do about evil executables?  Three alternatives:
<p>
1. Shrink wrap and trust. <br>
2. Limit the app and don't trust.  (Java's approach.)<br>
3. Like 1, but delegate the trustworthiness decision to someone: an
ISP, a corporate DP office.
<p>
The warnings that web browsers emit about downloading apps amount to
the "shrink wrap and trust" model: they ask the user to decide whether
the source is reliable.
<p>
The warnings are invisible to most people, "like a fly they swatted".
Ed ran an experiment and confirmed this intuition.
<p>
Approach 2 (Java's) can be made better if we empower applets more.  For
example, let them store an initialization file, but restrict its name
(\AUTOEXEC.BAT should be rejected). 
<p>
Felten believes in a hybrid of these approaches. 


<H3>Rating of applets and pages by a rating agency</H3>
<p>
WWW Consortium people described a system whereby rating agencies can
rate Web pages for safety, much as they now rate them for pornography
and violence.  Users can decide which rating agencies they want to
believe, perhaps even pay for the service.
<p>
The porno and violence ratings are not generally signed today; it
hasn't been necessary.  Safety ratings would have to be signed, which
means more infrastructure.


<H3>Secure Time Stamps</H3>
<p>
Stuart Haber (Bellcore)
<p>
The obvious (after a bit of thought) way to do secure time stamps is
to take a secure hash of a document and send it to a time-stamping
server.  The server then signs a certificate saying it witnessed the
hash at a particular time.  But the server has to be trusted. 
<p>
There's a way to do secure time stamps without adding a trusted
server.  A company publishes a secure hash each week in the New York
Times.  The point is that the hash is widely witnessed.  Anyone can
verify the hashes.


<H3>Trust Management in ERLink</H3>
<p>
Samuel I. Schaen (Mitre)
<p>
The Federal government is moving to use the Web for emergency
response, eg, to natural disasters.  This poses a whole set of
problems, like keeping the web servers from being swamped by the
general public, and reserving their bandwidth for emergency workers.
There is also a great need for both access control to prevent fraud
and such, and for flexibility to allow emergency workers to get the
job done.


<H3>Untrusted Third Parties:  Key Management for the Prudent</H3>
<p>
Mark Lomas (Cambridge University)
<p>
Lomas showed how to tighten up protocols so that misbehaving
certification authorities would be easier to catch.  For example, the
certification authority and the revocation authority would be
separated.


<H3>Trust Management for Mobile Agents</H3>
<p>
Vipin Swarup (MITRE) 
<p>
Swarup seemed to have a sophisticated and appropriate security model
for mobile agents.  He also presented ideas about how to achieve
safety--how to keep a subverted agent from penetrating its new
host--when an agent moved its execution context from one host to
another.  These ideas involved validation functions, but it was not
clear whether the state of a general program could be validated.


<H3>Policy-Controlled Key Release</H3>
<p>
Dennis Branstad (TIS)
<p>
The user will be able to set criteria for releasing information, such
as medical records:<br>
 - to certain people <br>
 - to people with certain roles (their doctor)<br>
 - upon certain events or conditions
<p>
Policies can have multiple authors (me, my doctor, my insurance
company) and can have conflicting parts.  There are priority rules.
<p>
He wants to automatically analyze policies for completeness (does it make
a decision in every case?) and consistency (can it make conflicting
decisions, with no basis for picking one?). 
<p>
This is in an early prototype stage.

<TITLE>New Security Paradigms Workshop '96 Report 
</TITLE>
<H2>Report on the 1996 New Security Paradigms Workshop<br> by Mary Ellen
Zurko and Cristina Serban</H2><br>
<p>
The 1996 New Security Paradigms Workshop was held at the UCLA
Conference in Lake Arrowhead, CA, September 17 - 20.  Hilary Hosmer
introduced the workshop, which she started in 1992.  It was originally
a workshop on impossible problems in computer security.  It now
emphasizes work on very recent, unfinished ideas which can serve as an
inspiration to work by others.
<p>
The first session was "Security in Its Contexts" chaired by Cathy 
Meadows. 
<p>
The first paper, "Harmonized Development Model for Information
Security", by Jussipekka Leiwo, Monash University, had no presenters,
and was skipped.
<p>
The second paper was "Simulated Social Control for Secure Internet
Commerce" by Lars Rasmussen and Swerker Jansson of Swedish Insitute of
Computer Science, and was presented by Lars. They are trying to make a
system with an emergent effect of fraud reduction to an acceptable
level. Relying on game theory, they note that iterated prisoner's
dilemmas reward cooperation, while a single instance of the dilemma
rewards defection. They are trying to achieve soft security, with no
central point of control. They run simulations of social control with
hundreds of agents. Some of the simulations have painful transition
phases for the cooperative agents.  Much of the discussion centered on
identity, reputation, and trust, since an iterated prisoners' dilemma
relies on stable identity for the parties.  Questions about modelling
included issues such as a referred trusted party not acting in a
trustworthy fashion because "it doesn't like my face", and modeling
stereotypes such as gender stereotypes. Most of the discussion also
centered on the singleton events that could produce bad results
instead of when the tradeoff between good and bad events could be
considered economically "good enough".

<p>
The second session was "User Control of Security" chaired by Tom
Lincoln.
<p>
The first paper, "User-Centered Security" by Mary Ellen Zurko and Rich
Simon of OSF Research Institute, was presented by Mary Ellen.  They
surveyed the history of "psychological acceptability" in secure
systems, and considered whether making secure systems usable is an
inherently particularly difficult task. They defined user-centered
secure systems as those with usability as a primary goal or
motivation. They presented three methodologies for achieving
user-centered security: applying usability methods to secure systems,
generating security models or mechanisms for Computer Supported
Cooperative Work (CSCW), and motivating the design of security
features based on identifiable user needs (user-centered design of
security). Much of the discussion centered on the tension between
security and usability. While more informative errors can greatly
enhance usability, they can also introduce covert channels.  The lack
of usability can work against security too; people try to work around
things to make their life easier, at the expense of security,
intentionally or not.  One idea was to use knowledge bases to
distinguish stupid behavior from malicious behavior.
<p>
The second paper "A New Model of Security for Distributed Systems" by
Chenxi Wang, William Wulf, and Darrell Kienzle of University of
Virginia. It was presented by William.  They start from the claim that
the TCB doesn't work for large scale distributed systems.  Legion,
their system, has agressive scalability goals, so it is assumed it
will run on top of fragile, insecure systems.  There's no one thing
that the system requires its users to trust.  In fact, the system does
not trust itself, since it could have been corrupted before it was
downloaded ("rogue Legionnaire").  There is no owner of the
distributed system. It is made up of a federation of folks who
willingly sign up.  Security has costs; not everyone is willing to
pay, and there is no single security policy. Legion is based on three
design principles: 1) "First, do no harm"': a correct Legion is not an
avenue of attack.  2) "Caveat emptor: Let the buyer beware":
ultimately individuals are responsible for themselves; the system is
responsible for very little. 3) "Small is beautiful": if it is little,
it's hard(er) to corrupt it to do something wrong.  Legion is an
object-oriented system.  The designer of an object class is the
responsible entity and the entity to be protected is the object. The
name of the object is its public key.  Discussion centered on how poor
people are doing difficult system management, and issues with the
public key as a name such as key changes and identity comparisons.
<p>
The next session was "Agent Security", chaired by John Dobson.
<p>
The first paper was "Personal Security Assistance for Secure Internet
Commerce" by Andreas Rasmussen and Swerker Jansson of Swedish
Institute of Computer Science. Andreas presented.  To answer the
questions of how an end-user gains confidence and trust in downloaded
programs, they presented a security assitant approach.  It is an open
architecture of agents acting as sensors. Each agent has
responsibility for monitoring some aspect of a program's execution and
notifying the user of unexpected activities.  This relies on some
statement about what a program should do. They hope to be able to
categorize programs by expected behavior or class, such as all
editors. These categories will list both expected and disallowed
actions. Agents should be easy to find, add, and replace, but they
have to be trusted.  Most of the discussion centered on issues of
coverage by the agents.  For example, it was not clear what happened
when an action that was not on either the allowed or disallowed list
occurred.
<p>
The second paper was "Communicating Security Agents" by Robert Filman
of Software Technology Center and Ted Linden of Lockheed Missles and
Space. Ted presented.  Their work is motivated by the need for
foolproof security controls for distributed systems that are both
flexible and context sensitive. They suggested that since mammals
devote large fraction of processing to security that it might not be
unreasonable for computer systems to devote two orders of magnitude of
processing power to it. They are developing Safebots to translate very
high level specification languages into executables that can wrap
insecure components. In contrast to firewalls, this is a pervasive
approach. Assurance comes from continuous mutual vetting of
distributed Safebots. Discussion included considering english as a
language for security ontology (ontosec), and the depth and redundancy
security mechanisms needed for this approach.
<p>
The final session of the first day was "New Paradigms for Security
Policies" chaired Yvo Desmedt.
<p>
The first paper was "A Credibility-Based Model of Computer System
Security" by Shaw Chuang and Paul Wernick of University of
Cambridge. It was presented by Shaw. They consider the credibility
level of statements made on behalf of a particular user based on
attributes such as context and time. Credibility is meant to be a
qualitative, rankable value that can be compared within a system (and
possibly across systems). It can be derived from statements from
others, the quality of authentication mechanisms, the transmission
medium, certification by a "trusted party", certification of a process
(ISO 9000), knowledge/awareness of the assessor, and the assessor's
perceptions of principal's trustworthiness.  The credibility applies
to some statements but not to others. There are user interface issues
with determining what level/value of credibility is required.
Discussion emphasized questions about composing credibilities, whether
negative credibility would be supported, previous work using fuzzy
logic, and whether Bayesian theory would help.
<p>
The final paper of the first day was "The Emperor's Old Armor" by Bob
Blakley of IBM NS Distributed Systems. Bob's discussion was mostly
about the source of problems in the old paradigm, which he called the
"Information Fortress Model." It relies on three problematic
foundations: 1) system integrity: every part must be perfect, but
humans and their artifacts are fallable, 2) cryptography for secrecy:
again, implemenations must be perfect, and people are bad at keeping
secrets anyway, 3) policy: security policy scales poorly and its
administration is complicated and sensitive.  This paradigm is used in
a world where there are more systems which are less assured, the tasks
they are used for are more complex, and we have made no progress in
integrity, assurability, physical security, composability or policy
simplification. Cryptographic protocols are better, but can't use
strong cryptography in commercial products. Attacks can cause us to
close the doors on our fortresses, causing a denial of service
problem. One possible direction is to consider inherent vs. imposed
properties of what we want to protect. Examples of inherent properties
are size, weight, radioactivity, difficulty, and obscurity. Policies
based on inherent properties are easier to maintain (for example, the
size and weight of $1 billion dollars in gold make it harder to steal
than bits). Bob suggested making electronic cash bit (many bits) to
slow down stealing and illicit spending. Discussion against this idea
included pointing out that convenience is a bit selling point of
electronic cash. Bob then pointed out that the strength of our
cryptographic protections only depends on no one having found a way to
break them.  "How much of the wealth of the world are we willing to
bet that our cryptographers are smarter than everyone who will born?"
One of the attendees told a story of a fortified town where all the
warriors had gone off to engage in battle.  An enemy army approached
the town, and the wise old patriarch left in charge had to defend his
town using women, children, and old men. He opened up the gate of the
town and, sitting on the top of the wall, invited the enemy commander
in to talk. The commander considered the situation and determined that
the invitation must be a trap, and so left the town untouched. The
moral is good enough is good enough.
<p>
The first session of the second day was "Architectures and Mechanisms
chaired Pierangela Samarati.
<p>
The first paper was "Developing and Using a Policy Neutral Access
Control Policy" by Duane Olawsky, Todd Fine, Edward Schneider, and Ray
Spencer of Secure Computing Corporation. Duane presented. The work
reported had developed a policy-neutral security server for the DTOS
microkernel. Each microkernel service is mapped to a subject, object,
and permission, and a single request can perform many services.
Security IDs are associated with subjects and objects, and mapped to
security information. A security policy specification can be used by
many audiences: assurance, developer, evaluators, accreditors. It is
also used to generate most of the code that checks permissions. They
have implemented MLS and Clark and Wilson in this system. They are
considering ORCON.  It is difficult to say which services are needed
and which are extraneous, since they have discovered that many
policies need only a handful of permissions.  Discussion centered on
issues of complexity for the administrator and support of policies
such as least privilege and time-based ones.
<p>
The second paper was "Run-time Security Evaluation: Can We Afford It?"
by Cristina Serban and Bruce McMillin, University of
Missouri-Rolla. Cristina presented.  She discussed the performance
issues that had arisen in their earlier work on run-time distributed
security evaluation in the context of a distributed application with
message exchange. They require a security specification or policy to
determine what correctness means. They want to flag errors resulting
from faults or intruders at run-time during each execution. The
assertions are coded into the application, and run-time event
histories are generated by each component and shared with all the
others. The causal structure of the execution gives a partial ordering
of event (using vector clocks). Each node checks all the shared
histories against the security specifications, looking for
disagreement. They measured a 40% decrease in performance (which
compared well with the earlier paper that suggested two orders of
magnitude was allowable). They want to consider how to get some of the
benefits while reducing the costs. Discussion included considering the
security impacts of this kind of evaluation. Since security
specifications don't include many events that shouldn't happen, these
don't get checked for. Someone asked, "If I use this on an A1 system,
and it detects an error, do I still have an A1 system?"
<p>
The second session was "New Paradigms For Access Control" chaired by
Tom Haigh.
<p>
The first paper was "A New Security Paradigm for Distributed Resource
Management and Access Control" by Steven Greenwald of Naval Research
Laboratory.  Steven started by discussing the problems with the
Jurassic Age Security Policy that dates back to the giant mainframe
computers, lazily grazing on their data.  A system administrator must
be enlisted to manage the resources which users and applications need
managed. This causes difficulties in distributed, heterogeneous
environments. Users require thee permission of system administrators
to share their resources across domains. Steven considered maximizing
the freedom of users while limiting system administration to only
necessary functions.  In the context of a Computer-Supported
Cooperative Work (CSCW) application, he suggests that applications
handle any needs for user IDs and roles, and that administrators
merely need to give these applications access to their resources.
They can then support anonymity and handle the accountability
issues. They can manage distributed user identity and compartment
information.  Discussion centered on policies such as officer of the
day for hospitals, and distributing the role of governor across
individuals. 
<p>
The second paper was "Access Control in Federated Systems" by
Pierangela Samarati and Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati of Universita
di Milano. Pierangela presented. They considered the issues involved
in trading off local and federated control of resources and login 
identities in a federated system of cooperative yet autonomous 
component systems. Access control may be specified independantly, 
bottom up, or top down, raising the issue of consistancy. 
Reconciliation may occur at different times such as whenever the
policies get out of synch, on-demand, and whenever a object is 
accessed. Policies may also let the site retain full authorization 
power, give it to the federation, and require checks at both levels.
Their work allows for negative authorizations at the local level 
only. Federation level groups and wildcards help with the
scalability issues. Users may belong to just one group. Objects can 
be exported to the federation in a limited manner (such as
read-only). Discussion included the issues around trusting other
administrations, and enforcing policies with a dynamic component such
as orcon.
<p>
The next session was "Distributed Systems" chaired by Cathy Meadows.
<p>
The first paper was "The Right Type of Trust for Distributed Systems" 
by Audun Josang of Norwegian University of Science and and Technology.
His work attempts ot understand trust as a human phenomenon and 
discuss how it applies to distributed systems. He tries to extract 
trust parameters from the real world. In a world of uncertainty it 
becomes very important to figure trust out. He presented a model with 
two entity types and two trust types. Entities can be passionate 
(humans) or rational (systems), or combinations of the two. Passionate
entities can be honest or malicious, and can be tempted. Rational 
entities can be secure or insecure, and can be threatened. The
trusting entity is passionate; the rational entity uses belief. Trust 
is potentially unstable, and reflects the state of knowledge about 
security or honesty. Trust is diverse over functions (trusting for 
different purposes) and time (very dynamic). While it is sufficient 
to be rational to assess the reliability of a system, assessing the
reliability of humans takes skill and experience. Audun concluded by
saying that to have stable trust, we need good knowledge. Discussion 
included questions on how to treat rational systems written by 
passionate people, and other aspects of trust: it's brittle, behaviour
in animals is a result of adaptation, and it's a hypothesis about 
future behaviour.
<p>
The second paper was "CAPSL: Common Authentication Protocol 
Specification Language" by Jonathan Millen of MITRE. The vision is 
that a CAPSL description of an authentication protocol (that uses 
cryptography) can be used as input to the wide variety of tools and 
approaches that are used to evaluate these protocols. This variety is 
needed since no one approach to vulnerability analysis is completely 
satisfactory. CAPSL is also meant to be usable by protocol 
designers/analysts to define protocols and to ease that task. The 
language takes a message list approach, and contains primitives for 
things like the data held by parties and their initial beliefs. 
Discussion centered on the details of the style choices in the
language, such as using the same symbol for assignment and equality 
checking. Jonathan has an area on the Web for discussing these details 
collaboratively.
<p>
The final session of the day was "Availability" chaired by Dixie 
Baker. In health care, availability means you might save a life, while
privacy means you might get sued. Both papers were presented by 
Hilary Hosmer.
<p>
The first paper was "Managing Time for Service and Security" by Ruth 
Nelson of Information Systems Security and Elizabeth Schwartz of
University of Massachusetts at Boston. Hilary began by outlining 
problems such as security mechanisms being exploited to shut a system 
down and legitimate and reasonable use of the system can also produce 
unexpected denial of service problems (such as the day that Jerry 
Garcia day, when Deadheads bogged down the Well). Some systems find a 
way to limit the load by gradually throttling certain types of inputs 
(White House email is using this approach). The basic questions to the 
designer are: What are the required system services - to whom and how 
much?, Is service more important than security?, and What are the 
control mechanisms? (measuring and monitoring, audit 
vulnerabilities?). She suggests that system management techniques are 
applicable to security. Discussion centered on other current examples 
of availability problems.
<p>
The last paper of the day was "Availability Policies in Adversarial 
Situations" by Hilary Hosmer of Data Systems Security. She called on
us to rethink traditional availability policies such as "90% uptime".
Availability is not always desirable; in the military, if your site is 
overrun, you must destroy it. In cyberspace we are interested in 
information availability. There are social threats to this (censors, 
marketeers). She wants to study policies where availability, 
confidentiality, and integrity are measured together. Discussion
included references to real availability engineering as it is 
practiced today, identifying critical paths and single points of
failure, and access control as a mechanism that can support 
availability. A final example of an availability problem was 
mentioned: Abbie Hoffman threw $300 in crisp new dollar bills on the 
floor of the NY Stock Exchange and brought it to its knees; what kind 
of attack is that?
<p>
The final session on the final day was "Paradigms from Other Fields"
chaired by Hillary Hosmer.
<p>
The first paper of the day was "Positive Feedback and the Madness of 
Crowds" by Hilarie Orman of University of Arizona. Rich Schroeppel 
presented. The title of the paper is taken from a Dover reprint
"Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds." Rich 
started by pointing out phenomena that built on positive feedback such 
as the tulip pricing bubble (when tulips became extremely popular) and 
various forms of stock market madness. He suggested the study of the 
composition of dynamic systems as an approach to the availability 
issues being raised, pariticularly in the context of the whole 
network. Simple, unbounded loops are easy to build and can cause 
feedback problems. The cannonical example is recursive email
distribution lists. If you can identify a loop, you can limit the 
nuber of times a resource is consumed in a loop, or insert drag into 
it. Another type of feedback was dubbed "flash floods." An example is 
everyone going to the Cool Site of the Day on the Web. An approach to 
these problems is to insert drag or negative feedback into the system. 
One challenge is to add in random backoff without breaking things. One 
parameter that complicates the problem is time. The time constant 
ranges from nanoseconds to years (the latter is the case with 
recurring urban myths such as the Good Times Virus). The challenges 
include efficient specification and code analysis for potential 
resonances and runtime adaptation. Discussion included current 
problems (such as having a single cool site of the day instead of 
redundant copies) and attempted solution (such as Ethernet's 
exponential backoff on collision and the use of priorities).
<p>
The final paper of the workshop was "Just Sick About Security" by
Jeff Williams of Arca Systems. It was presented by Bill Wilson. It 
explored the analogies between response to disease and healthcare in 
general and computer security. While this is not a perfect analogy, we 
may be able to learn from the differences as well as the similarities. 
As we try to deal with increasing complexity in computer systems we 
look to the complexity of organisms for ideas. There is a tradeoff
between performance and security in organisms; deeply recessed eyes 
are protected but less effective. Some of the comparisons he made 
were: fight or flight vs. shutdown, pain vs. auditing, FDA vs.
evaluation organizations, and checkups vs. certification and 
accreditation. Can we leverage off "survival of the fittest" to 
produce selection criteria that tends to promote better security?
In healthcare, wellness is a process. Should security professionals be 
certified? Can we make use of warning labels? We hope that there's no 
ebola coming, and we may use laws and law enforcement for those who 
are intentionally harmed. Discussion included exploration of the 
analogies, such as struggle for life, federation wrappers as a sense 
of self, and evolution as a process of running as hard as you can to 
stay in place. Software is currently a process of "survival of the fit 
enough." The state of software was likened to 19th century patent 
medicince. In response to the anthropomorphic analogy, Steven 
Greenwald suggested that computers really don't like it when you 
anthropomorphize them :-).
<p>
Cathy Meadows was tasked with producing a synthesis of the ideas. She 
noted the emphasis on: decentralized, distributed systems, more user 
control, more flexibility for describing and enforcing, and 
interaction with global policy. Two other threads were: 1. assurance: 
making a convincing argument that system will work using game theory, 
dynamic systems, medicine, or runtime evaluation, and 2. how can 
different ideas support each other? using systems, policies, models, 
and metaphors.
<p>
The workshop concluded with a business meeting. Proceedings will be
put together in the near future. The initial call for papers for
NSPW '97 will be available at NISSC in late October. We're still 
looking for a publications chair for the next workshop.

<TITLE>1996 Communications and Multimedia Security Conference Report 
</TITLE>
<H2>Report on the 1996 Communications and Multimedia Security Conference <br>
by Alexander Roehm</H2><br>
<p>
The joint IFIP TC6 and TC11 working conference on
Communications and Multimedia Security 1996 was held on 23rd
and 24th of September 1996 at the University of Essen
(Germany).  The working conference had approx. 90 attendees
from 16 different countries. The conference was opened  by the
organization chair Mr. G. Pernul (University of Essen) and the
program chair Mr. P. Horster (Technical University of
Chemnitz/Zwickau). 
<p>
The conference was organized in 10 sessions, 5 each day, of
which 2 per day took place in parallel tracks. Talks during
the working conference were considered to take 25 min. with
additional 5 min. for a discussion on the talk.
<p>
The program served a wide range of interests from highly
technical R&D projects to user oriented management and
administration topics.  Papers presented addressed a broad
spectrum of communications and multimedia security related
subjects, including: basic concepts, multimedia and hypertext
systems, attacks, dedicated solutions, healthcare and
telemedicine, cryptographic techniques, security
infrastructures, payment systems, access control, models and
policies, auditing and firewalls.
<p>
Monday 23rd:<br>
The first session was chaired by Mr. Horster and
addressed 'Multimedia Security'. Three talks were given by Mrs.
Krannig, who presented a platform for secure multimedia applications
called PLASMA, Mr. Fernandez presented about high level security
issues in multimedia and hypertext systems, and Mr. Warren talked on
security in healthcare multimedia systems. The next session was
chaired by Mr. Katsikas and was on `Attacks`. Mrs. Laurent presented
two security risks in the ATM Emulated LAN architecture and Mr.
Michels showed a failure in a voting scheme of Itoh, Kurasawa and
Park, who also attended the workshop. Mr. Pernul chaired the session
'Dedicated Solutions' where several ideas were presented. Mr. Olivier
showed, how to use workflow to enhance security in federated
databases. Mr. Kesdogan gave a talk about anonymous mobility
management for third generation mobile networks which was followed by
a description of security concepts for the WWW, given by Mr. Lipp.
After the lunch break a session on 'Network Security' chaired by Mr.
Fox took place. It consisted of two talks by Mr. Forne, about
securing ISDN and Mr. Chrissikopoulos, who applied network security
to a telemedicine system. During the first days last session
'Cryptographic Techniques', three Papers were presented. Mr.Cheng
showed, that image decomposition can be used for encryption,
Mr. Petersen presented a way to delegate rights by using digital
signatures and Mr. Lucks argued, that a blockcipher algorithm, which
divides plain text into two blocks, can be modified for arbitrary
block sizes. Mr. Michels chaired this session.

<p>
Tuesday 24th:<br> 
Several aspects of key infrastructure were discussed
during second days first session, which was chaired by Mr. Kraaibeek.
Mr. Gustavson proposed a WWW based certification infrastructure,
while Mr. Oppliger described a distributed registration and key
distribution system for online universities. Mr. Schwenk talked
proceeded on establishing a key hierarchy for conditional access. 
The next session was chaired by Mr. Lipp and began with Mr.
Zangehnehs talk, who gave an introductory overview on payment systems
in the Internet. Mr. Radus talk followed, where he described a blind
signature scheme, which can be applied in e-cash systems. Afterwards
Mr. Pntz presented a method for secure billing. At the same time a
parallel session focusing on 'Access Control' took place, where Mr.
Leitold talked about ISDN LAN Access, Mr. Trommler on secure WWW
access to server groups and Mrs. Schmidt argued, that handwriting
features should be added to electronic access control systems. This
session was chaired by Mr. Fernandez. Two presentations were
made at the session on Models and Policies, which was chaired by Mr.
Vossbein. One by Mr. Kokolakis dealt with problems in up to the
present existing security models, the other dealt with attack
modeling and was made Mr. Katsikas. The last session of the
conference was chaired by Mr. Roehm and was focused on Auditing and
Firewalls. Mr. Sobirey presented a way to do privacy oriented
auditing, while Mr. Katsikas described the expert system component
of SECURENET. Last talk of Mr. Boshoff was on tracing routes using
features of TCP/IP for increasing capabilities of firewalls.
<p>
The conference is seen as a success by the attendees and
speakers. The next Communications and Multimedia Security
Conference will be held on 22nd and 23rd of September 1997 in
Athens.  
<p>
There are few volumes of the proceedings left which can be purchased 
for DM 98,-- (approx. 65 US$). Orders will be treated on a
fifo basis. For further information contact Alexader W. Roehm

<TITLE> Letter from the Editor</Title>
Dear Readers,
<p>
First, thanks very much to my colleague Andy Moore, who took care of
Cipher chores while I was away for four weeks in August.  And thanks to
all of you for your patience in waiting for this issue.  
<p>
Please notice the submission dates for next spring's Symposium on
Security and Privacy:  papers are due 15 November.  Program Co-chairs
George Dinolt and Paul Karger are planning to accept submissions either
electronically or by hard copy.  I plan to mail the full call for
papers to the Cipher mailing list soon after this issue appears.
<p>
Erland Jonsson reports an encouraging response to the questionnaire
published in the last issue, but he has asked to distribute it one
more time in hopes of additional responses; it appears near the
end of this issue.
<p>
The IEEE Computer Society asks that TC members please send in new
membership renewal forms before 31 December.  The form appears in this
issue (as it has in every other issue); please do fill it out and send
it in.  It costs nothing more than a stamp, and it will put you on the
IEEE CS's roster of TC members (or keep you from falling off).

<TITLE>Trust Technology Assessment Program Workshop
</TITLE>
<H2>NIST/NSA Formally Unveils Trust Technology Assessment Program
by Jeremy Epstein, Cordant, Inc.</H2><br>
<p>
The Trust Technology Assessment Program (TTAP) is a joint effort by 
NIST and NSA to allow evaluation of low assurance commercial products 
by commercially licensed facilities.  On September 26, NIST and NSA 
held a public workshop to explain how TTAP will work.  This is a 
summary of the workshop.
<p>
The TTAP project has been underway for about five years, and has been 
explained in numerous papers and conference panels.  The workshop was 
to make available, for the first time, the documents that provide 
detailed explanations of how organizations can become licensed to 
perform TTAP evaluations and how TTAP evaluations will be performed. 
The 45 workshop attendees were about 50% potential TTAP laboratories, 
25% vendors, and 25% government (mostly TTAP presenters).
<p>
Under TTAP, evaluations will be performed by LTEFs (Licensed TTAP 
Evaluation Facilities).  There are two parts to understanding TTAP: 
the licensing process and the evaluation process.  To be licensed, an 
organization needs to be accredited under NIST's National Voluntary 
Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP).  In addition, the 
organization must pay accreditation fees and pass an on-site 
assessment (which includes reviewing the backgrounds of the proposed 
evaluators, conducting an evaluator proficiency exam, and examining 
the organization's quality assurance).  Once the LTEF is licensed, it 
can conduct TTAP evaluations.  Initially, TTAP will cover TCSEC C2 
evaluations only.  TTAP evaluations will be reviewed by an NSA 
Technical Review Board (TRB), just as is done with the current NSA-run 
Trusted Product Evaluation Process (TPEP) evaluations.  TTAP 
evaluations may eventually include TCSEC B1 evaluations, C2 and/or B1 
network evaluations, and Common Criteria evaluations.
<p>
A set of draft documents were handed out describing the above 
processes in detail:
<ul>
<li> "TTAP Scheme" describes the overall concept
<li> "TTAP Technical and Organizational Requirements for Accreditation", 
(known as "TORA", but consisting of one volume rather than the five 
one might expect :-) together with the "NVLAP Procedures and General 
Requirements" (NIST Handbook 150) describe how to become an LTEF
<li> "Derived Verification Requirements for TCSEC Class C2: Controlled
Access Protection" describes how LTEFs will evaluate C2 products
<li> "TRB Expectations" was not released
</ul>
<p>
All of these will be available (soon) from the TTAP Web site 
http://csrc.nist.gov/ttap.  NIST and NSA invited comments and 
questions on the documents and the process (send to 
ttap@csmes.ncsc.nist.gov).  A workshop will be held on November 20 at 
the Institute for Defense Analysis (IDA) in Alexandria VA to discuss 
TTAP further.
<p>
Under government sponsorship, Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) 
started an experimental TTAP evaluation of Hewlett-Packard's HP-UX to 
determine the viability of the process.  Thus far, the CSC team has 
completed IPAR TRB, after expending approximately 6 person-years of 
evaluation effort.
<p>
Starting in spring 1997, NIST will begin a two year pilot program to 
accredit LTEFs and do TTAP evaluations.  The plan is that once a 
sufficient number of LTEFs are accredited, NSA will cease beginning 
new C2 evaluations.
<p>
One of the more interesting topics covered was the business case for 
being an LTEF.  While NIST and NSA were unable to give expected effort 
levels or costs for a TTAP evaluation, members of the audience 
estimated the cost from $300K (for a very straightforward evaluation, 
such as a standalone UNIX system) to $2,000K or more for a more 
typical complex product. Although a dollar figure was not provided, 
the CSC experiment seems to bear out that this is an accurate order of 
magnitude for cost. It remains to be seen whether vendors will pay 
these fees to an LTEF in addition to the expenses already incurred to 
develop and support the evaluation of a trusted product.  The NIST 
representative suggested that an LTEF might be more viable once other 
types of evaluations are started (such as Common Criteria evaluations 
of firewalls).
<p>
It is unclear today whether vendors will spend the money to support 
both a TTAP and an ITSEC (European) evaluation, given that U.S. 
government organizations will accept an ITSEC evaluation if there is 
no competitive product with a U.S. rating. Finally, several vendors 
expressed the opinion that unless government organizations start 
purchasing evaluated products rather than obtaining waivers, there is 
no value to the vendor in evaluating the product.

<TITLE>10th IFIP WG 11.3 Working Conference on Database Security
</TITLE>
<H2>Report on the 10th IFIP WG 11.3 Working Conference on Database Security
by David Spooner, Chair, IFIP WG 11.3</H2><br>
<p>
IFIP WG 11.3 held its tenth working conference on database 
security at Villa Olmo, in Como, Italy, on July 22-24, 1996.  
The conference included the presentation of fourteen refereed 
papers, two invited talks, two panel sessions, and a group 
exercise session.  This conference restored a long standing 
tradition of holding the working conference on a waterfront, 
in this case, Lake Como.  By all accounts, the conference was 
a success.
<p>
The conference began with two invited talks.  Teresa Lunt 
(ARPA) discussed "Strategic Directions in Computer Security 
Research," making the point that there is a growing demand 
for secure systems, but current secure technologies are often 
fragile. She identified many areas where additional research 
is needed, including affordability, generic solutions, richer 
policies, scalability, and metrics for demonstrating 
progress.  Bhavani Thuraisingham (MITRE) discussed "Data 
Warehousing, Data Mining, and Security," suggesting that 
there is much commercial interest in data warehousing and 
data mining and that the security field needs to look 
carefully at the implications of these technologies on 
privacy and security of data.
<p>
The next session was on federated systems and included the 
presentation of three papers.  The first paper was presented 
by Zahir Tari (Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology) and 
was titled "Security Enforcement in the DOK Federated 
Database System" (co-author, George Fernandez). Tari 
discussed a unified security model and an architecture for 
distributed heterogeneous database systems that integrates 
many existing security models. The second paper was presented 
by Martin Olivier (Rand Afrikaans University) and was titled 
"Integrity Constraints in Federated Databases."  Olivier 
discussed a technique that allows a database system to obtain 
a certified guarantee of data integrity for the data it 
receives from another system in a federation.  The final 
paper in the session was presented by Silvana Castano 
(University of Milan) and was titled "An Approach to Deriving 
Global Authorizations in Federated Database Systems."  
Castano discussed issues in computing global authorizations 
from local authorizations in a federated system.
<p>
The next session was a panel discussion chaired by Sushil 
Jajodia on "Multilevel Secure Transaction Processing: Is It 
Well Understood?"  The panelists were Vijay Atluri (Rutgers 
University), Thomas Keefe (Penn State University), Catherine 
McCollum (MITRE), and Ravi Mukkamala (Old Dominion 
University).  In general, the panelist shared the opinion 
that much work has been done on the problem and that 
solutions are known with certain limitations.  They differed 
in their views of the importance of future work in this area, 
since existing commercial systems do not yet incorporate much 
of the work.  Several panelists called for the need to better 
understand the needs of the customer.
<p>
The second day of the conference began with a session on 
object-oriented security.  The first paper in this session 
was presented by John Hale (University of Tulsa) and was 
titled "A Framework for High Assurance Security of 
Distributed Objects" (co-authors Jody Threet and Sujeet 
Shenoi).  Hale discussed the use of a process calculus 
tailored for concurrent objects to develop a formal model and 
layered architecture for secure interoperation of 
heterogeneous distributed objects.  The second paper in this 
session was presented by Reind van de Riet (Free University) 
and was titled "An Object-Oriented Database Architecture for 
Providing High-Level Security in Cyberspace" (co-author Ehud 
Gudes).  He discussed the concept of alter-egos as a 
representation for people in cyberspace. He also discussed an 
implementation based on Mokum, an object-oriented knowledge-
base system, and on CORBA.  The final paper in this session 
was presented by Frederic Cuppens (ONERA-CERT) and was titled 
"A Logical Approach to Model a Multilevel Object Oriented 
Database" (co-author Alban Gabillon).  Cuppens discussed a 
formalization and extension of the Multiview model using a 
language based on first-order logic.
<p>
The next session was a group exercise lead by Pierangela 
Samarati (University of Milan) and Ravi Sandhu (George Mason 
University) on "Open Questions in Database Security."  It 
began with a presentation by John Campbell (Department of 
Defense, U.S.A.) on "Secure Database System Issues."  
Campbell identified a number of issues requiring additional 
research, including secure distributed systems, multimedia 
systems, parallel systems, and heterogeneous systems.  This 
was followed by a general discussion with the goal of 
identifying important research areas in database security.  
Some of the issues discussed included: (1) development of a 
reference model (possibly component based) and metrics to 
better define what a secure database system is, (2) how to 
deal with the fact that we must accept a non-ideal world with 
untrusted components mixed with trusted components, (3) how 
much can be done in an application-independent way and what 
depends on the semantics of a particular application system, 
and (4) recognition of the fact that the database is often 
just one component of a larger system, and we must consider 
the security of the larger system, not just the database by 
itself.
<p>
This session was followed by an afternoon of sightseeing in 
the Como area and a social dinner in small local restaurant.  
The food, wine and conversation were all excellent.
<p>
The final day of the conference began with a session on 
multilevel databases.  The first paper in this session was 
presented by Sushil Jajodia (George Mason University) and was 
titled "A Secure Locking Protocol for Multilevel Database 
Management Systems" (co-authors Luigi Mancini and Indrajit 
Ray).  Jajodia discussed a secure locking protocol that 
produces serializable histories of transactions for single 
version data.  The protocol requires only a trusted lock 
manager.  The next paper was presented by Gary Grossman (ARCA 
Systems) and was titled "A Data Model for a Multilevel 
Replicated X.500 Server" (co-author Marvin Schaefer).  
Grossman discussed the incorporation of multiple sensitivity 
levels into an X.500 directory service through the use of 
replication.  The final paper of the session was presented by 
Bhavani Thuraisingham (MITRE) for Janet Aisbett (University 
of Tasmania) and was titled "An Information Theoretic 
Analysis of Architectures for Multilevel Secure Databases."  
This paper discusses a framework for accessing the cost of 
security in a distributed database architecture from an 
information theory point of view.
<p>
The next session was on new directions in database system 
security.  It began with a presentation by Thomas Hinke 
(University of Alabama, Huntsville) of a paper titled "A 
Framework for Inference-Directed Data Mining" (co-authors 
Harry Delugach and Randall Wolf).  Hinke discussed a second-
path inference detection approach using association 
cardinalities.  The second paper in this section was 
presented by Vijay Atluri (Rutgers University) and was titled 
"An Extended Petri Net Model for Supporting Workflows in a 
Multilevel Secure Environment" (co-author Wei-Kuang Huang).  
This paper shows how Petri Nets can be used to detect and 
prevent task dependencies that violate security in workflow 
models.
<p>
The next session was a panel organized by Ravi Sandhu (George 
Mason University) on implementation experiences and 
prospects.  The panelists were LouAnna Notargiacomo (Oracle), 
Dan Thomsen (Secure Computing Corporation) and Jess 
Worthington (Informix).  During initial presentations by the 
panelists and subsequent discussion, the point was made that 
users want more tailorable security policies than are 
available today in commercial systems.  Traditional mandatory 
access control is not want everyone wants.  New technologies 
such as the world wide web are having an impact on what users 
want.  There appears to be a market for secure database 
products, but these products must support a wider variety of 
policies and enforcement mechanisms and they must be easy to 
use.
<p>
The final session of the conference was on role-based 
security and began with a presentation by Silvia Osborn 
(University of Western Ontario) titled "On the Interaction 
Between Role-Based Access Control and Relational Databases" 
(co-authors Laura Reid and Gregory Wesson).  Osborn discussed 
issues and techniques for mappings between a role graph and 
the set of privileges in a relational database system.   The 
final paper in this session was presented by T. C. Ting and 
was titled "Generics and Exception Handling for Supporting 
User-Role Based Security in Object-Oriented Systems" (co-
authors S. A. Demurjian, M. Price, and M.-Y. Hu).  This paper 
extends the authors' previous work to handle extensibility 
and reuse for role-based security enforcement mechanisms to 
facilitate the design of software systems.
<p>
Special thanks go to the organizing committee for the working 
conference who put together a well run and interesting 
conference: Elisa Bertino (General Chair), Pierangela 
Samarati (Program Co-Chair), Ravi Sandhu (Program Co-Chair), 
and Silvana Castano (Local Arrangements).  The proceedings 
for the working conference will be published by Chapman & 
Hall Publishing Company (London) in early 1997.  The title 
will be "Database Security X: Status and Prospects," with 
editors P. Samarati and R. Sandhu.  The next IFIP WG 11.3 
Working Conference will be held in Lake Tahoe, California, on 
August 11-13, 1997.  The call for papers can be accessed from

<TITLE> Letter from the Editor</Title>
Dear Readers,
<p>
If you check the Cipher web pages regularly, you will know that many
of the items in this issue have been available for a week or two;
my apologies to the authors for not getting this issue out until
now, but I think you will find the content worthwhile nonetheless.
The next Cipher will appear (I hope!) in mid- to late- September.
<p>

A few highlights in the area of security and privacy since the
last issue:<br>
In June, a three judge panel in Philadelphia ruled that the US
Communications Decency Act indeed violated the US Constitution and
issued a preliminary injunction against its enforcement.  In July,
the Justice Department announced that it would appeal the case to the
Supreme Court.
<p>

NIST held a workshop on sharing computer vulnerability data;
results should be available soon, but in the meantime, Chris Klaus
of ISS has devoted a section of his web site to this topic; see<br>
<a href=http://www.iss.net/vd/vd.html>http://www.iss.net/vd/vd.html</a>
<p>
On the countermeasures side, Janet Misich of DISA's Center for
Information Systems Security broadcast a call for security products
to be placed in their catalog and database; contact her at  
spd@ncr.disa.mil or (703)681-1345 if you have a product to list.
<p>

Also in June, the UK Department of Trade and Industry held a meeting
on "Trusted Third Party" proposals; check sci.crypt for a stinging
account of it by Ross Anderson.  Brian Gladman also distributed 
comments on the UK's cryptographic policies, suggesting that while
the proposals represent progress of a sort, they raise many
questions that so far are unanswered.  The text of the government's
position is said to be available at  
<a href=http://dtiinfo1.dti.gov.uk/cii/encrypt/>
http://dtiinfo1.dti.gov.uk/cii/encrypt/</a>
but I was unable to get through just now.  Reports also circulated
that the OECD, meeting in Paris June 26-28 to consider cryptography
policy, failed to take the next step toward international 
recognition of key-escrow systems.  The group is scheduled meet in Paris
again September 26-27.
<p>

Inter@ctive Week reported that Trusted Information Systems announced
the sale of a system that would support commercial key escrow
applications to "a large multinational corporation with headquarters
outside the US."  The firm was speculated to be Royal Dutch Shell.
<p>

The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) and Internet Engineering Steering
Group (IESG) also weighed in with a statement on cryptographic
policy and the Internet, arguing that restriction on the use
of cryptography, on key length, and other controls are against
the interest of consumers.  The statement favors "ready
access to uniform strong cryptographic technology for all Internet
users in all countries."  
<p>

Meanwhile, testimony of luminaries of the cryptographic world
was heard on Capitol Hill and via live audio over the Internet
concerning the PRO-CODE legislation.  No one's opinions seemed to
be changing very much, though Netscape has now been permitted to
distribute its export-controlled versions electronically.  See
the New Reports section of this issue for other export-controlled
source code made available for electronic distribution since June.
<p>

Mastercard and Visa published a new specification for Secure
Electronic Transactions (SET).  According to some reports, earlier
versions of the specification provided less cardholder information
to the retail merchant, to prevent fraud, but the current version
reflects changes made in response to merchants' complaints and
permits them greater access to cardholder data.
<p>

Cipher needs your contributions;  there have been (and will be,
in August) several conferences that I would like to receive reports
on, and there are probably others you know about and I don't.  Please
don't hesitate to write up what you learn that you think will be
of general interest and send it in.

<TITLE> Letter from the Editor</Title>
Dear Readers,
<p>
Thanks to Christoph Schuba and Mary Ellen Zurko for responding to my
last minute appeal for reporters for the Security and Privacy
Symposium; the report in this issue is their gift to you. Thanks and
congratulations also to Dale Johnson, Steve Kent, John McHugh, George
Dinolt, the Program Committee, and most of all the authors and
attendees who continue to make the Symposium worth the trip.
For the first time, the TC is assembling a hypertext version of the
proceedings; at this writing we have installed URL's to well over
half the papers presented, and more should be available in a few weeks.  
See URL <a href=http://www.itd.nrl.navy.mil/ITD/5540/ieee/SP96proceedings.html>
http://www.itd.nrl.navy.mil/ITD/5540/ieee/SP96proceedings.html</a>
<p>
Also this month brought an official report from the US General
Accounting Office confirming that there are lots of hackers beating on
the doors of Department of Defense unclassified systems (and the door
is too-frequently left ajar) and the National Research Council's report
on cryptographic policy.  With several bills addressing this policy
currently before Congress, the debate seems unlikely to cool down for a
while.
<p>
Cipher's research registry is off the ground, but I know there
are many more projects out there; send in those URL's.  
<p>
Finally, amidst the new journal announcements I ran across this one:
<pre>
                        Call for Papers

     An International Journal on Failures and Lessons Learned in
Information Technology Management has been founded. The journal will be
published four times a year, starting from January 1997. The publisher is
Cognizant Communication Corp., New York.

<HR>
Over half of the conference papers and panel submissions are now
available via the first ever IEEE S&P Symposium hypertext proceedings, 
available  
<a href=http://www.itd.nrl.navy.mil/ITD/5540/ieee/SP96proceedings.html>here</a>;
authors, please send URLs pointing to your contributions to <address>cipher@itd.nrl.navy.mil</address>.
<HR>
The 17th IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy was held at the
Claremont Resort in Oakland, CA on May 6-8, 1996. This one-track
symposium was sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society Technical
Committee on Security and Privacy in cooperation with the
International Association of Cryptologic Research (IACR).
<p>
The symposium was well attended with about 200 registered attendees.
Monday consisted of four sessions, two of which were panel discussions
that addressed the activities of the object management group's CORBA
security standard, and goals for computer security education. The
refereed paper session held Monday discussed new results in covert
channel analysis. The final session of the day was composed of sixteen
five-minute research talks. The official program closed with a
reception and poster session.
<p>
Tuesday consisted of four sessions, the first was a panel discussion
on medical information systems. The other sessions covered topics in
security protocols, database security, and biologically inspired
topics in computer security. Eight additional presentations focused on
modeling and networks.
<p>
The focus of the symposium has shifted in the past few years, the
emphasis moving from military security in the 80's to commercial
security in the 90's. Rich Simon, a conference attendee in the
mid-80's, pointed out that there was not a single military uniform to
be seen this year (a big change). Conversely, Dan Wallach, a Princeton
graduate student and co-author of the Java paper, mentioned he had
never seen so many suits in one room. The program addressed
application areas such as electronic commerce and medical information
systems. Additionally, last year's experiment, with a complete session
consisting of five-minute research talks, was so successful that the
experience was repeated. Sixty-seven submissions for refereed papers,
four panel proposals, and the diligent work of the program chairs and
referees resulted in an interesting and diverse symposium program.
<p>
MONDAY
<H3>
  Panel: Object Management Group CORBA Security Standard</H3> Moderated by
    Terry Benzel (TIS)
<p>
The participants included Bob Blakley (IBM), Richard Soley (OMG), Bret
Hartman (Black Watch Technology), and Roger Schell (Novell). Terry
Benzel's current project is exploring the use of CORBA to interoperate
between trusted and untrusted systems.
<p>
Soley began the presentations with an overview of the OMG. He
explained the CORBA architecture and goals of the OMG standards. He
emphasized that objects are only the tools to solve problems in
information access, particularly in terms of interoperability between
users and any information source.
<p>
Bob Blakley gave an overview of the CORBA security standard. He
reviewed four issues in detail: authorization management scale, object
semantics, forms of delegation, and non-repudiation services. The
first problem is scale; there are thousands of users and millions of
objects. Users have privilege attributes, which are name/value pairs.
Some attributes such as groups, roles, and clearances are defined, but
attributes are also extensible. There is a defining authority for
privilege attributes. The second problem is that objects are not
structured any way in advance. Objects must be grouped into domains
which have an access policy that maps privilege attributes to granted
rights. Domains can be implemented in many different ways. A similar
problem had to be addressed with object operations, since objects are
heterogeneous and can have many operations. Classes are mapped to
required rights. Operations such as 'get', 'set', and 'admin' are
defined a priori, and the set is extensible. Finally, a policy maps
privilege attributes to required rights, and the access control
decision engine compares required and granted rights. Two forms of
delegation are supported: a simple impersonation model (delegate all
my attributes) and a compound delegation model that allows individual
attributes to be delegated. There is a standard non-repudiation
interface. Object reuse protection and system integrity are up to
implementors. CORBA does produce guidelines for high integrity systems
and for auditing. The audit guideline is motivated by auditable events
occuring below the object code, e.g., in DCE.
<p>
Hartman discussed building a trustworthy CORBA system. He concentrated
on the question of who wants assurance, what the vulnerability
trade-offs in distributed object systems are, and what conformance
with the CORBA security standard means. The specification describes
how to build a secure ORB, not how to give security services to users.
Having a good API alone is not enough, the internal integrity of the
system is critical. The security standard guidelines encourage
flexibility and offer different levels of assurance. Within CORBA,
there is a common security framework. Distributed object systems pose
a complex security problem. They are complex to administer, dynamic
systems are hard to analyze, diverse environments lead to unjustified
trust, disjoint policy domains do not interoperate well, and layered
security mechanisms require complex analysis. Hartman pointed out that
the importance of key security issues differ across areas: the main
concern of healthcare is with the integrity of patient records; the
military cares strongly about confidentiality; and electronic commerce
is very interested in non-repudiation. Vendors of CORBA security
compliant systems have to produce a conformance statement, describing
the security relevant features of their product. Hartman claims this
procedure allows customers of such systems to make informed decisions
about the security of their systems.
<p>
Roger Schell criticized the CORBA security standard on several points.
First, it is not clear what the standard is trying to accomplish. It
is obviously infeasible to solve all security related problems, but
there is no concrete statement in the specification that makes clear
what an important subset to be solved is. Schell was concerned that
users would have problems understanding what they get when purchasing
CORBA security compliant systems. He also pointed out that there was
very little reference to the existing body of knowledge in security (a
minor theme that would turn into a full chorus at the Java evening
discussion). For Schell, the relationship between security services and
a more classical view of security as protection against efforts to
circumvent controls was not clear. What set of security services and
mechanisms is sufficient for protection?
<p>
During the following discussion, Blakley pointed out that the OMG had
not wanted to exclude any vendor, nor any existing standards. That is
why the specification is so large and unfocused. Vendors choose what
subset of security services they considered sufficient. In the
competition in object-oriented systems, security might not be the
determining factor. When questioned about the maturity of the system,
the audience was told "not to use this system for air traffic control
this year". Another important point raised was that implementations
are not interoperable, and the specification does not ensure
interoperability.
<H3>
  Covert Channels</H3> Chaired by Sylvan Pinsky (NSA)
<p>
The first paper presented by Ira S. Moskowitz (NRL) was "An Analysis
of the Timed Z-Channel" (joint work with colleagues Stephen J.
Greenwald and Myong H. Kang). This work is one of the first
contributions in literature on noisy covert channel analysis. The goal
is to devise a closed form for the capacity of noisy covert timing
channels.
<p>
Todd Fine (Secure Computing Corporation) presented "Defining
Noninterference in the Temporal Logic of Actions." His motivation was
to provide an intuitive statement of noninterference as well as
conditions appropriate for analysis. Noninterference is a technique
for analyzing a system model for covert channels.
<H3>
  Panel: Goals for Computer Security Education</H3> Chaired by Cynthia
    Irvine (Naval Postgraduate School)
<p>
Panelists were Stephen F. Barnett (NCSC), Jim Schindler (HP), Leslie
Chalmers (Wells Fargo Bank), Karl Levitt (UC Davis), and Roger Schell
(Novell). Irvine's motivation, as an educator of individuals trained
for security work, was to understand what the employers are looking
for.
<p>
From an employer's prospective, Stephen Barnett examined the kind of
training today's security practitioners require. In particular,
Barnett discussed the questions: what are people currently educated to
do, what should be included in a security curriculum, and what can
industry do to help. He stressed the fact that not only security
officers, product designers, and educators need to be educated, but
also the consumers and users of computer technology.
<p>
Jim Schindler based his analysis of the need for security education on
a central theme: Change. Technology is changing, computer paradigms
are changing, and security requirements are changing. He considers
security education a must for a much larger community than security
professionals, e.g., vendors, end-users, managers, and executives.
Electronic commerce was his example for the latest trend in computer
technology and the need for strong security.
<p>
Leslie Chalmers pointed out that there is a need for credentials for
security professionals without special university degrees. At Wells
Fargo, junior security people have jobs that require little skill. The
more senior and professional employees are assigned higher
responsibility projects. Chalmers discussed the need for knowing the
business, consulting skills, communication skills, and sales skills.
Security is only important and viable as long as it supports the
business goals. Chalmers mentioned that the banking security crowd
rarely overlaps with the traditional audience of the IEEE symposium.
<p>
Roger Schell stated that he was not impressed with what education
provides. He needs people who can think and grow, as well as having a
grounding in the fundamentals. Both Schell and Chalmers referred to the
problems of people trying to work in security without any background or
reading on the subject. There is a phenomenon that people think they
know security, but they really do not. This occurs, because failure is
not apparent.
<p>
Karl Levitt emphasized the need for additional support in security
education at the undergraduate level, in particular the need for a
good and current textbook. He (together with Ross Anderson) stressed the
role of educational institutions as providers of science, not
specifics. Particular technical knowledge must come from different
sources.
<p>
The panel agreed that it is desirable to provide security education to
a broader audience than only computer science students. However there
was no consensus on the question of the appropriate place for this
topic in an already filled undergraduate curriculum, or how to make
time for it. Additionally, the ethics of teachers encouraging students
to try to break software and systems as part of learning about
security was briefly discussed.
<H3>

TUESDAY
<H3> 
  Domain Specific Security</H3> Moderated by Deborah Cooper (Cooper)
<p>
"Security for Medical Information Systems." was the anchor paper by
Ross Anderson (University of Cambridge). It was followed by a panel,
chaired by Deborah Cooper, with Don Biggar (Unisys), Thomas C.
Rindfleisch (Stanford University), and Bruce Sams, a retired MD.
<p>
Anderson's work was based on the British medical system. The United
Kingdom government's initial approach at a security policy for
computerized medical data was similar to multi-level security. This
was unworkable since even low level data such as contract data can be
sensitive, e.g., if it deals with psychiatric work. Anderson's
approach assumes that the main threat is from insiders, i.e., someone
with legitimate, but limited access to patient records, and that the
inability to locate and access all of the distributed paper records is
a good defense. Therefore, aggregation of data must be controlled.
Anderson discussed nine principles that define his security policy
model. One of the guiding principles is that access to health
information is under the control of the patient, or the general
physician acting as the patient's advocate. Access control lists are
the mechanism of choice. Another interesting principle controls
aggregation of medical information. Essentially, the patient must give
his consent before a party involved that already has access to a large
number of records is allowed access to the patient's records.
<p>
Rindfleisch reviewed the flow of personal health information in the
United States. He pointed out that in the U.S. the situation is more
complex compared to the U.K. This complexity is because of legitimate
interactions of direct patient care, social uses, support activities,
and commercial uses. There is a patchwork of policies, many of which
are contradicting each other. Medical information access is regulated
on a state, not federal basis, e.g., 28 of 50 states allow patients to
access their own medical records. The stewardship of medical
information in the U.S. is quite different from the U.K. and other
European countries. There are operational difficulties with managing
access control lists.
<p>
Don Biggar stated that U.S. medical records are already in an electronic
format stored on mainframes. He perceives privacy concerns as a far
more global problem than discussed by the previous panelists.
<p>
Bruce Sams stressed the importance of the privacy problem for medical
records and applauded research done in this area. He pointed out that
in spite of the tremendous benefits of electronic storage and
transmission to facilitate better healthcare and research, there are
great dangers. Even though healthcare costs are often higher on
the priority list than privacy, anonymity of medical information for
research purposes, and privacy in general must be guaranteed by any
technical solution proposed.
<p>
There is a pilot experiment conducted by the Department of Defense in
Hawaii whereby patients carry their own medical records at all times.
The panel recognized that access to medical information as a basis for
warfare is a tremendous threat.
<p>
Rindfleisch concluded that computer systems are not ready for prime
time in the healthcare system, simply because they are less usable
than paper. For many, security is an even less important concern than
usability. In spite of many years of research at building a usable and
secure system himself, he has not yet succeeded.
<H3>
  Protocols</H3> Chaired by Michael Reiter (AT&T)
<p>
The first presentation was "Entity Authentication" by Dieter Gollmann
(University of London). Gollmann investigated the question why the
definition of authentication seems to be such a hard problem. There is
a translation problem between "human" meaning of authentication, and
the meaning of authentication in cryptographic protocols. He advocated
using the language of communications protocols instead of
human-to-human authentication when discussing these protocols.
<p>
A second paper, "A Fair Non-repudiation Protocol", was also presented
by Gollmann. This protocol uses a trusted third party to assure that
neither party in the non-repudiation protocol has an advantage over
the other.
<p>
"Limitations on Design Principles for Public Key Protocols" by Paul
Syverson of NRL took a cautionary look at the design principle
approach to cryptographic protocols. He examined a handful of design
principles and gave apparently secure protocols that contradicted
those principles. Syverson recommended checking the design motivations
when using guidelines, then checking any violated principles for
problems.
<H3>
  Databases</H3> Chaired by Mary Ellen Zurko (OSF)
<p>
The session began with "Ensuring Atomicity of Multilevel
Transactions", presented by Indrakshi Ray (George Mason University)
(joint work with colleagues Paul Amman and Sushil Jajodia). The
technique decomposes multilevel transactions into single level
transactions, ordered from low to high. These transactions are then
analyzed (for now, by hand) to ensure that interleaving will produce
correct results.
<p>
"View-Based Access Control with High Assurance", written by Xiaolei
Qian (SRI), was presented by Teresa Lunt (ARPA). Specifying a level on
a view is very easy and natural, and leads to content-based access
control. However, the query processor is the bulk of the code in a
database management system. This amount of code is considered too
large to be part of the trusted computing base in a high assurance
environment. In addition, there are complications from overlapping
views and from overclassifying data. The technique described in the
paper addresses two problems of multilevel secure databases: safety
and assurance. It describes a polynomial-time label compilation
algorithm that transforms view-level labeling to tuple-level labeling.
A further contribution of the paper are proofs that the lowest
classification and minimal upgrade problems are NP-complete.
<p>
"Supporting Multiple Access Control Policies in Database Systems" was
presented by Pierangela Samarati of the University of Milan (joint
work with colleague Elisa Bertino and Sushil Jajodia, George Mason
University). Their work uses a Directed Acyclic Graph of group
memberships to determine authorization based on explicit positive and
negative authorizations. An authorization can be strong or weak.
Conflicting strong authorizations are not allowed, strong
authorizations override weak ones, weak authorizations lower on a
single group path override those higher up, and conflicting
authorizations deny access. 
<H3>
  Biologically Inspired Topics In Computer Security</H3>Chaired by Lee
    Benzinger (Lockheed)
<p>
Stephanie Forrest (University of New Mexico) presented the first paper
titled "A Sense of Self for UNIX Processes" (joint work with
colleagues Steven A. Hofmeyr and Anil Somayaji, and Thomas A.
Longstaff, CERT). Forrest proposed a simple method for anomaly
detection. The method is based on a preliminary definition of self for
UNIX processes (statistical collection of short sequences of system
calls) and the detection of previously unseen behavior (a sequence of
unseen system calls). This approach inherits all the well understood
shortcomings of anomaly intrusion detection. Forrest presented
encouraging first results of this work in progress.
<p>
Secondly, Patrik D'Haeseleer (University of New Mexico) described "An
Immunological Approach to Change Detection: Algorithms, Analysis, and
Implications", (joint work with colleagues Stephanie Forrest and Paul
Helman). D'Haeseleer's work also addresses the question of how to
detect changes. His work takes an immunological approach by generating
a set of detectors as the complement of detectors that detect "self".
The generation of detectors is more efficient than previously
published algorithms and runs in linear time. A further advantage of
this approach is the fact that the detectors are in fact
distributable.
<p>
"Cryptovirology: Extortion Based Security Threats and Countermeasures"
Adam Young (Columbia University), (joint work with Moti Yung, IBM) The
approach uses encryption to hide information, and then to extort money
or goods from the victims. The point was that encryption could be used
as a force for evil as well as good. Good backups are the best
defense.
<H3>
  IEEE Technical Committee on Security and Privacy Meeting</H3>
<p>
<i>[Note: Look for an Deb Cooper's account of the meeting and other
TC business in the next issue of Cipher--CEL</i>]
TC Chair Deb Cooper mentioned that the IEEE web site can now be used to add
and change membership information (http://www.computer.org/). The
Cipher security newsletter recently began a research project registry.
After discussion about whether Cipher could support information on job
hunting, the group settled on researching if a registry would be
enough help to college students looking for a job. Carl Landwehr
requested assistance in maintaining the Cipher reader's guide (list of
security-related publications).
<p>
A discussion of alliances with other conferences developed. The
Oakland conference attendance averaged 200 attendees over the last 3
years. At the peak it got over 300
attendees ('89). The number of submissions has been going down, and
this caused concern. Many people postulated that the growing number of
security conferences has begun to dillute their quality. An alliance
with the ISOC symposium on network and distributed system security
will be discussed at future meetings.
<p>
Sushil Jajodia suggested the addition of tutorials. Several people
liked the idea of advanced tutorials in areas to cross-fertilize their
research. (Jajodia also suggested a vendor track, for which he
received strong criticism). Hilarie Orman brought up the issue of
electronic publishing. It is highly likely that next year's
proceedings will be available on-line.
<H3>
  Secure Mobile Agents (BOF)</H3>
<p>
The final event of the evening was a discussion session on Secure
Mobile Agents. It was primarily about Java, with a Telescript person
in attendance. Sun representatives gave an outline on Java. Sun
believes that the problem of secure mobile agents is full of subtle
difficulties, but that it is a a reasonable thing to try to do. The
Princeton authors presented their recommendations on how Java should
proceed. There was concern during the meeting that there was no
defined policy, and that putting assurance before policy is
unworkable. George Dinolt implied that users do
not set security policies, systems set security policies. Telescript
never looked so good. For any issue, the panelists were able to discuss
their approach to a problem, even if they did not have all the
answers. In discussing authentication, it was pointed out that the
Microsoft model was to emulate COTS software with digital signatures.
John McHugh pointed out that the number of applets will be
substantially larger than the number of COTS software packages, and
what would that imply about level of testing? Dan Wallach brought up
points concerning the user interface design of security features. He
wished to use "Do not bother the user" as a guiding principle, which
would be a refreshing change. Telescript is exploring having every
regional server apply digital signatures to endorse mobile agents, but
considers it a heavyweight mechanism.
<p>
WEDNESDAY
<H3>  
  Modeling</H3> Chaired by Richard Neely (CTA)
<p>
The first paper was "A Security Model of Dynamic Labeling Providing a
Tiered Approach to Verification", presented by Simon Foley (University
College, Cork), (joint work with Li Gong and Xiaolei Qian, both SRI).
Foley described a verified TCB with security requirements specified on
top of it. The tiered system has the advantage that for a new
application only the security requirements need to be reverified.
<p>
Martin Roescheisen of Stanford presented "A Communication Agreement
Framework of Access Control" (joint work with colleague Terry
Winograd). This model uses communication agreements to establish
peer-to-peer relationships, called commpacts. These agreements are the
focus of a framework for access/action control. The primary concerns
are usability and social acceptability. Commpacts manage relationships
providing trusted shareability.
<p>
Matt Blaze (AT&T Research) presented "Decentralized Trust Management"
(joint work with colleagues Joan Feigenbaum and Jack Lacy). The paper
identifies trust management as an important component of security in
large distributed systems. The authors argue that it is important not
to confuse the questions of "Whose public key was verified" with the
question of "For what purpose is this public key issued?". This
approach provides an architectural framework that separates generic
mechanism and application-specific policies. The concrete system is
called PolicyMaker and appears to applications much like a database
query engine. The generic mechanism can be utilized from any
application with different policies. That provides the decentralized
aspect of the architecture. The approach purposefully conflates the
specification of security policies and security credentials, the
policy decision process, and the deferring of trust to third parties.
<p>
The final paper was given by Steve Schneider (University of London)
entitled "Security Properties and CSP". Schneider's work is part of a
larger project dealing with problems of modeling and analysis of
security protocols. The basis is that security protocols can be viewed
as communicating sequential processes. CSL can be used to check safety
properties (which are viewed as security properties) of protocols
described as processes that interact over a medium.
<H3>
  Networks</H3> Chaired by Paul Karger (IBM)
<p> 
Drew Dean (Princeton University) presented "Security Flaws in the
HotJava Web Browser" (joint work with colleagues Ed Felton and Dan S.
Wallach). The paper outlines a number of attacks, both potential and
verified, on the HotJava Web browser. In Java, local file system
applets are trusted. A security manager module needs to be called to
approve dangerous operations, but there is nothing architecturally
which ensures that the module is always called appropriately. Applets could
contact any host (contrary to the stated security policy) through DNS,
and could degrade or deny service while other applets were being run.
The authors also exploited a vulnerability based on the difference
between what code would compile with a legal Java compiler and how
byte codes are checked. This vulnerability allowed them to run
arbitrary machine code. In Java there is only a single line of
defense; the class loader. Most of the vulnerabilities exposed have
since been patched, however, some have not.
<p>
The next paper was presented by Wenbo Mao (HP Labs, Bristol) "On Two
Proposals for On-line Credit-card Payments using Open Networks:
Problems and Solutions." He pointed out some missing services in the
areas of protocol integrity, non-repudiation, message receipt, and
message timeliness, and some misused services where non-repudiation
is used where authentication would work, and real-time replay
detection is done when batch would be sufficient.
<p>
"Secure Network Objects" was presented by Leendert van Doorn
(University in Amsterdam) (joint work with Martin Abadi, Mike Burrows,
and Edward Wobber, all DEC SRC). Van Doorn described their approach to
provide security for object-oriented network communication. The design
takes advantage of subtyping and achieves object-level granularity.
Both access control lists and capabilities are supported.
<p>
The last paper of the conference was "Run-Time Security Evaluation
(RTSE) for Distributed Applications" presented by Cristina Serban
(University of Missouri-Rolla) (joint work with colleague Bruce
McMillin). The central idea of this paper was that formal security
specifications for distributed applications can be checked at runtime.
This is done through executable security assertions.
<p>
The symposium formally adjourned after closing remarks from Dale
Johnson and the new program chair George Dinolt.

<TITLE> RECENT SECURITY & PRIVACY DEVELOPMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES</TITLE>
<H2>Recent Security & Privacy Developments in the United States, 
May 1994 - May 1995</H2>
by Willis Ware, RAND
<p>
<i>[This is Willis Ware's annual report to IFIP TC 11 as its US representative.
Willis cautions that this report was written in April, prior to the release
of the Clipper III , GAO, and NRC reports released in May.]</i>
<p>
In the last 12 months, there have been major interruptions in the U.S.
government process as a result of disputes about budget matters.
Accordingly, things related to system security which might otherwise
have happened have either dragged or have stopped completely.
<p>
This discussion emphasizes U.S. export policy and U.S. encryption
policy, both of which have been topics of ongoing debate, public
discussion, and various initiatives.  Other items are briefly
summarized.
<p>
Export policy. The issue of concern is the export of cryptography,
whether in the form of a standalone device or integrated into a system
or as technical data.  The U.S. controls such exports in two ways: for
products that have been adjudged readily exportable, the Department of
Commerce grants a commodity jurisdiction [CJ] license.  For products
that have to be considered on a case-by-case basis, the Department of
State controls the process and issues a single-case license.
<p>
Over a year ago, the policy had been adjusted to allow CJ export of
40-bit (key length) algorithms such as RSA's RC2/RC4.  Vendors asserted
that this can not provide adequate strength for customer demands and
various other schemes have been proposed.  In particular, Lotus has
negotiated commodity jurisdiction status for its Notes product
incorporating 64-bit key-length cryptography.  Specific details are
sketchy but apparently 24-bits (of the 64) are separately signed and
encrypted with a special key generated by and retained by the National
Security Agency.  With this arrangement, the strength against 3rd party
intrusion is 64-bits but with the proper court authorization, 24-bits
can be recovered from the escrow agent(s) of the U.S. Government.
Hence, the arrangement is still compatible with the established 40-bit
export policy.
<p>
The Government itself has proposed other possibilities in the spirit of
the original Clipper arrangement.  The most recent is to allow export of
64-bit cryptography provided its keys are fully escrowed with
organizations approved by the U.S.Government.  It is not being well
received.
<p>
Cryptographic policy.  For approximately 18 months, the National
Research Council of the National Academies of Science and Engineering
has sponsored a committee to examine the broad issue of national
cryptographic policy.  Its report is in the final phase of preparation
and is expected to be published in late May, 1996.  Meanwhile, the
outcome of the committee's deliberations is not known.
<p>
The Administration has quietly maintained the progress of the Clipper
proposal insofar as its original thrust was intended; namely, a
significant number of Clipper-equipped telephones have been acquired for
the internal use of the government.  The escrow agents for their keys
are the Communications Division of the Department of the Treasury and
the National Institute of Science and Technology of the Department of
Commerce.
<p>
A proposal nicknamed "son of Clipper" and offering alternate
arrangements for escrowing of keys was also floated but did not receive
good acceptance.  Other proposals for handling an escrow-type process
have appeared.  One has been called "self-escrow" because an
organization would maintain its own backup copies of cryptographic keys
but be prepared to relinquish them to law enforcement authorities upon
presentation of appropriate court authorization.  Another is being
called "commercial-key escrow" because it envisions independent business
entities whose mission would be to receive cryptographic keys from
clients, to maintain them securely but repond to law enforcement
authority when authorized by a court procedure.  Another has been called
"fair escrow" because it visualizes that keys would be broken into (say)
N parts, of which any K of them would be sufficient to recover encrypted
traffic.  Yet another is called "partial-key escrow" because only some of
the key digits are escrowed.
<p>
The case for assured access to encrypted material by the government or
law enforcement is far from convincingly made in the U.S.  The U.S. FBI
is still very vocal in its requirements to have such access, but its
focus of argument has broadened beyond encrypted telephony to include
stored computer materials.  There has not been offered any hard data to
indicate the magnitude of encryption usage in secure telephony or data
files, or to assess its status or rate of growth. The argument for law
enforcement access is being made on the emotional basis of a safe and
orderly society, in turn supported by specific anecdotal incidents which
are admittedly socially reprehensible.  The other side of the case
generally argues against government intrusion on personal freedom and
liberty, plus a deeply rooted concern about relinquishing so much power
to the government.
<p>
Importantly, however, Congress has become engaged in the issue and there
are presently bills before both the House and Senate (the Goodlatte bill
in the House and the Leahy bill in the Senate).  Both address not only
relaxation of export controls, but also law enforcement access and the
legal obligations and responsibilities of escrow agents.  The language
and construction in each is slightly different, but in general both
affirm positively that "it shall be legal for any person [within the
U.S., its possessions, and territories] to use any encryption,
regardless of encryption algorithm selected, encryption key length
chosen, or implementation technique or medium used."  The House bill
also provides that "no person in lawful possession of a key to encrypted
information may be required by Federal or State law to relinquish to
another person control of that key."  There is also a Burns bill, not
yet introduced, which will address only the issue of export of
cryptography and not the other issues in the Goodlatte and Leahy bills.
Finally, the Kyl amendment amends the criminal code to broaden the
penalties and actions taken against information systems.
<p>
It is not clear, with an election pending in November of 1996, how
rapidly encryption policy will progress, whether the bills now before
Congress will make any headway, or even whether the Administration will
pursue any proposals that have now been surfaced.
<p>
On other matters, there continue to be cracker and penetration
incidents but the cert organizations in the U.S. and worldwide,
coordinated by by an organization called FIRST, seem to be dealing
well with the incident response issue.  There are limited signs of
concern about security of systems.  For example, VISA and MasterCard
have announced a standard to protect bankcard data during electronic
transactions; it proposes to use specially designed algorithms from
RSA.  On the other hand, various studies and penetration attempts
support the conviction that computer and network security in
government and in the private sector is overall not well implemented.
<p>
Extant organizations continue to hold their conferences and workshops,
but some new ones have come into being; e.g., the various conferences
sponsored by NCSA, the RSA annual cryptography conference.
<p>
At the national level, the National Information Infrastructure effort
has organized an in-house group of studies under a body called the NII
Task Force.  It has issued for comment a document describing  proposed
guidelines on system security within the government.  Other documents
have also been issued; one that has created major opposition and
discussion addresses the protection of intellectual property -- the
generalized copyright issue.
<p>
The sixth Computers, Freedom and Privacy conference has been held during
March, 1995 at MIT, and this year featured a moot court with real judges
presiding over a hypothetical case involving escrowed encryption.  This
particular annual conference has been remarkably successful in bringing
together an appropriate cross section of attendees to discuss and
interact on issues arising from the interplay between society and
communications/computer technology.
<p>
The browser known as NETSCAPE has become exceedingly popular among users
of Internet and in fact has driven a huge surge of commercial interest.
Everybody who is anybody now has a home page on a Web site.  The growing
thrust to use the Net as a means for the conduct of commerce and the
sale of products led Netscape to put RSA-based encryption into its
system to safeguard personal and bankcard data.  There have been two
rounds of events in which substantial weaknesses were discovered and
quickly repaired by Netscape.  A weakness was also discovered by
Purdue's COAST laboratory in MIT's popular KERBEROS system, but it was
not publicly announced until MIT designers had installed technical
remedies.
<p>
The concept of Information Warfare has become prominent and led to
specialized conferences, books, and government-sponsored study.  In
general, it envisions deliberate clandestine covert attacks against the
information systems of a country, both themselves directly and as they
occur in the general national infrastructure.  To the extent that this
subject attains credence and standing, it will motivate better system
security.
<p>
There is little to be said about privacy in this period.  The word
itself has appeared in the title of some laws [e.g., Senator Leahy's
Encrypted Communications Privacy Act of 1996] but it is really used as a
synonym for confidentiality.  Nothing new has been done to control the
widespread use of personal information for a broad variety of commercial
purposes, and many observers feel that the government has taken actions
that allows such activity to be more intrusive than ever; e.g.,
authorized the creation of new data banks, authorized the use by states
of the Social Security Number as a de facto personal identifier.
<p>
Interestingly, the Digital Telephony Act, enacted in late 1994, and
requiring that communications providers design systems with technical
features able to assure that wire tapping by law enforcement continues
to be feasible, has not yet been funded.  As a reminder though, during
discussions leading to the final wording of the law, important privacy
protections were in fact added to the bill through the participation of
civil liberties' groups and privacy advocates.
<p>
The Federal Communications Commission pre-empted the actions of many
states by ruling that calling-party identification (the scheme that
announces the phone number of a calling party to the called party) must
be made available in all interstate telephony, but it also required
every telephone company to conduct an aggressive information campaign
for subscribers and to offer both per-call and per-line blocking.  In
California where about 50% of all telephone numbers are unlisted (i.e.,
not in the telephone book), the tone of the information campaign almost
encourages the subscriber to opt for line blocking (i.e., an outgoing
call will not deliver its number to the called party but prefacing the
dialing with *82 will negate call blocking for the single call).
<p>
At the same time, the FCC also ruled that calling-party numbers which
are provided to the called party as part of the 800-number system
(so-called ANI numbers) may no longer be used for purposes other than
for which collected.  This will curtail some of the commercial selling
of phone-number lists.

<TITLE>Comment on "Enforcing the CDA Improperly May Pervert Internet Architecture" </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
Editor:
<p>
I thought it very important to comment on David P.  Reed's article in
EI-9604 titled "Enforcing the CDA Improperly May Pervert Internet
Architecture". 
<p>
Mr.  Reed's basic position is that technical solutions to access
controls in the Internet should be done at the ends of the pipes and not
in the infrastructure and that this philosophy as espoused in the
"end-to-end argument" is one of the major reasons for the success of the
Internet over the years.
<p>
My disagreement with Mr.  Reed's position is basically very simple.  The
Internet Protocol already has an infrastructure-based access control
scheme built into it, and that scheme has been in place throughout the
development of the Internet.  Thus his assertion that the lack of such a
scheme is responsible for the Internet's success is fundamentally
flawed.  The access control scheme is a part of the IP protocols, and as
currently defined, it provides for about 8 different classifications of
information.  It also has another 8 classifications available for use
with the specific use not yet specified.
<p>
It would be a trivial matter for the Internet Engineering Task Force to
assign one of those access control codes to CDA blocked material.  No
infrastructure changes are required, no substantial protocol changes are
required, it does not hinder or effect non-CDA blocked material in any
way, and it costs nothing.  Using existing TCP stacks and the freely
available widely-used TCP-wrappers software, CDA-blocked material could
be limited anywhere in the infrastructure, including at the ISP, at the
user's home, and at the connection between the CDA-controlled provider
and their Internet connection.
<p>
As a side note, the "end-to-end argument" is very similar in some ways
to the "common-carrier" argument used by telephone companies to remain
out of the fray when providing telephone services. 
<p>
The basic position of the common carrier is that if someone attacks your
Internet site, it's between you and them.  The common carrier won't do
anything forceful to help the victim of an attack, for example, they
won't cut off the perpetrator's connection to stop the attack while it's
underway.  In the same manner, Mr. Reed asserts that the Internet should
not play traffic cop by providing access controls in the infrastructure,
and that if your 10-year old child is solicited through email, that is
your problem.
<p>
One of the results of this "common-carrier" mentality is that IP address
forgery is rampant on the Internet.  The most reasonable way to prevent
IP address forgery is for infrastructure elements to refuse to pass
packets when the source of those packets is not authorized to control
the "From" address in those packets.  But most of the infrastructure
providers refuse to provide this simple protection because of this
common-carrier mentality, and they use the end-to-end argument to
bolster their position.  The net effect is that untraceable denial of
service attacks are commonplace.  We can't provide end-to-end protection
against this sort of attack unless and until we can figure out where the
other end is, and we can't do that with only end-to-end protection.
<p>
One final point.  When your information infrastructure provider tells
you that information protection is not their job, that really means that
they don't value your information, they only value the payments they get
for your bandwidth.

<TITLE>Rebuttal to Fred Cohen's Comment </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
In rebuttal to Fred Cohen's response to my piece that you published in
Cipher, I'd just like to make a few points.
<p>
I think he has his facts wrong, in the first place; I know whatever 'access
control' mechanism he refers to is not there in the IP design, since I was
part of the original standards definition process.  If Fred would like to
name which IP feature, X, he thinks defines a content level access control
policy, I will be happy to respond in more detail.  But all of the fields in
the IP header are designed to manage the resources and logic involved in
routing of packets between the source and destination, not to carry content
level access control policy information. 
<p>
In the second place, he seems to attribute to me motivations that I don't
have;  I personally think internet service providers ought to help users
control undesired access to content - but I think that assistance is best
achieved by encouraging appropriate use of well-known end-to-end mechanisms
(such as content warning labels and encryption-based authentication) that
enable users and suppliers of high-level content to implement workable
policy choices.
<p>
In the third place, he attacks my claim that the scalability of the Internet
architecture has benefited from choosing to follow the end-to-end approach,
by arguing that some non-end-to-end feature X has been there all along, but
not implemented.  Had this feature X been implemented, his argument might
make sense, but I'm struggling to understand how he convinces himself that
this unimplemented and possibly illusory counterexample shows that the
end-to-end approach has not been a main contributor to scalability.
<p>
Finally, while likening the Internet carriers attitude to the 'common
carrier' principle, he characterizes 'indecent' communications as 'attacks'.
This is an odd description of indecency on the Web, wherein the indecent
material many are concerned with are files or web pages that are passively
available, but easily discovered by an interested seeker, and perhaps easily
discovered by accident.  The situation seems more like the presence of
'dirty' books in a library than an 'attack'.  It also seems odd to control
'attacks' by a voluntary mechanism that depends on the source of 'indecent'
material to place labeling information in IP headers.  Why would an
'attacker' choose to so vitiate his/her own efforts?  Does a provocateur
voluntarily wear a large red 'P' on their jacket?
<p>
My original note was concerned with the notion of 'Exon boxes' that would
enforce the CDA in routers.  The problem of protecting users against attacks
whose goal is sabotage, denial of service, loss of privacy, etc. is quite
different.  Confounding all of these issues does not help resolve them.
<p>

Report on the First ACM Workshop on Role-based Access Control,
Gaithersburg, Maryland, Nov. 30 - Dec. 1, 1995

<p>
The First ACM Workshop on Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) was held at
the National Institute of Standards of Technology (NIST) in
Gaithersburg, Maryland on November 30th and December 1st, 1995.  The
Workshop was sponsored by ACM SIGSAC, ACM DC Local Chapter and NIST.
Proceedings of the workshop are in preparation and should be available
in the May-June timeframe from ACM.
<p>
The Call for Papers describes the organizers' motivation in creating
this series of workshops.  Relevant portions are quoted below.
<blockquote>
  "In a nutshell, the essence of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is
   that rights and permissions are assigned to roles rather than to
   individual users.  Users acquire these rights and permissions by
   virtue of being assigned membership in appropriate roles.  This
   simple idea greatly eases the administration of authorizations.
   The basic concepts behind RBAC have been around since the advent of
   multi-user computing and information systems in the late 60's and
   early 70's.  There has been a recent resurgence of interest in
   RBAC.  This is in large part due to the user community's expression
   of interest in RBAC, and disenchantment with traditional mandatory
   and discretionary access controls.
<p>
   The ACM Workshop on Role-Based Access Control has been created to
   bring together users, vendors and researchers who are interested in
   fostering and promoting RBAC.  The Workshop's objectives are to
   provide a forum for rapid dissemination of new ideas and
   developments in RBAC, and to cultivate convergence towards a
   standard framework for RBAC and related access control issues.
<p>
   This is the first in a series of workshops to be held on a fairly
   frequent basis.  Ideally, we would like these workshops to develop
   a standard reference model for RBAC.  We recognize this cannot be
   accomplished in a single meeting, but we are seeking progress
   towards this end at a rapid pace.  In the first workshop we seek
   input from users regarding their access control needs, from vendors
   regarding plans for products, and from researchers concerning
   conceptual frameworks from which to approach these issues.
<p>
   Although there is much agreement on the basic concepts and value of
   RBAC, there remain a number of issues on which different
   researchers and vendors are proposing different approaches.  The
   user community is also often doing access control and management in
   a way that is very similar to RBAC without actually applying that
   name.  At the same time, the scope of RBAC ranges from very simple
   and straightforward at one end, to very sophisticated and
   complicated at the other.  Much remains to be done to develop a
   scientific and engineering discipline in this arena.  The ACM
   Workshops on RBAC are primarily intended to support this goal."
</blockquote>
<p>
The Workshop attracted attendees from the US, Canada and various West
European countries.  Many of the attendees met for the first time at
the Workshop.  We had representation from users, vendors, academia,
research laboratories and standards organizations.  Because the need
for RBAC is pervasive in computer systems it was particularly
gratifying that we had representation from the database, network,
distributed systems and operating systems communities.  Concepts of
RBAC have evolved more or less independently in these communities and
it is important to have Workshops such as this to foster
cross-fertilization of ideas.
<p>
The Workshop was successful in its modest goal of taking a first step
towards a consensus reference model for RBAC.  There was substantial
agreement among attendees regarding the general outlines of RBAC and
its various components.  There was considerable discussion about the
details, including the reconciliation of different terminology used by
different groups working in the field.  There was also extensive
discussion concerning the priorities and importance of various aspects
of RBAC.  Nonetheless, in general, there was substantial agreement.
<p>
From the workshop discussion two issues have emerged as significant
ones for further work in similar workshops and study groups.  Firstly,
any scientific discipline needs an internally consistent and widely
used terminology and vocabulary.  In the early stages, as the
discipline emerges, different people use the same words to mean
different things, and sometimes major concepts have not yet been
articulated and named.  As the discipline matures a de facto standard
terminology emerges.  Efforts to impose a standard terminology by
committee are rarely successful.  These efforts can be premature if
major concepts are still emerging in the field.  As the field matures
development of a de facto standard can be encouraged and helped by
workshops where disagreements about terminology and standards can be
articulated and discussed.  Discussions at the first workshop indicate
that RBAC is at the right point of maturity to merit such efforts.
<p>
Secondly, RBAC is an expansive concept.  In order to scope the problem
the RBAC community needs to clearly articulate what is excluded as
being outside the scope of RBAC proper.  This relates to the
terminology issue because we need to decide what should legitimately
be called RBAC.  But there is a bigger issue than terminology here.  A
sound technical discipline draws boundaries around its major concepts
for technical reasons.  The RBAC community needs to clearly identify
where it is useful to draw these boundaries for technical reasons (and
not merely for convenience of terminology).
<p>
In the rest of this report I describe my impression of the sessions as
they actually took place.  Let me emphasize that this is my personal
impression and I have not verified these remarks with other attendees.
A revised report incorporating feedback from attendees will appear in
the workshop proceedings.
<p>
After introductory remarks from representatives of the various
sponsoring organizations, the Workshop's first session on "What is
RBAC?" followed.  The first talk was presented by me.  My objective
was to present a framework of models for RBAC and the rationale which
led to this framework.  (This family of RBAC models was recently
published in IEEE Computer, Feb. 1996).  As is appropriate in a
workshop setting there were many questions and comments during the
presentation.  The central notion of this framework is that users and
permissions are brought together indirectly by roles.  So a user
acquires a permission by virtue of being assigned to a role that has
been assigned that permission.  The framework begins with a base model
to which role hierarchies and constraints are added in the extended
models.  This piecemeal approach is motivated by the use of the term
RBAC in the literature to include simple as well as sophisticated
concepts.
<p>
My talk was followed by a presentation from Virgil Gligor concerning a
RBAC model that has been developed for implementation on NSA's Synergy
platform.  Interestingly both talks presented work funded in part by
NIST.  A major discussion point during Virgil's talk concerned the
review of access rights and its importance in context of RBAC.  Virgil
argued that a central aspect of RBAC is that access review on a per
subject or per object basis involves similar effort.  Several
attendees noted that there are systems (such as Novell's NetWare)
which store access control data so that per object or per subject
review requires traversal of the access control data structures, but
such traversal has been demonstrated to be practical.
<i>Cipher readers: please note the following paragraph, which is 
revised by the author from the originally published version of this report. 
This revision entered on the Cipher Web April 30, 1996 -- CEL]</i>
My talk was followed by a presentation from Virgil Gligor concerning
a RBAC model that he has developed.  Virgil began by noting that if
RBAC proponents believe the notion of a role is fundamentally
different from that of a group of users we should be able to
articulate the essential difference.  Since access review is among
the basic aspects of access control, he proposed we distinguish
between roles and groups by requiring that roles allow us to perform
per-subject review of rights.  Moreover, per-subject review is
needed for separation-of-duty and conflict-of-interest properties
generally considered important in RBAC.  Virgil observed that
per-subject review is difficult in large distributed systems using
traditional access control lists (ACLs) because, given a user or
group identity, one does not know where to start the review.
Potentially, one would have to search the entire set of objects'
ACLs to determine the extent of a user's permissions.  In discussion
some attendees argued that such searches to determine per-subject
review are conducted by several practical systems (such as Novell's
NetWare, IBM's RACF and IBM's OS/400 list).  Virgil maintained that
none of these systems provide this support with "group" mechanisms
alone, and their access control models do not scale up to large
distributed systems.  Virgil argued that access control policies,
such as RBAC, that need both per-object and per-subject review could
be derived from the storage of the access matrix, redundantly, on
both rows and columns.
<p>
The second session continued the theme of "What is RBAC?"  Emile Lupu
of the Imperial College in London, UK presented a talk on a policy
based framework for RBAC.  His co-author and thesis advisor Morris
Sloman has been conducting research in this area from the perspective
of distributed systems management.  Lupu's talk introduced the
concepts of obligations and duties going beyond the access control
notion of permissions.  Lupu and Sloman were careful to point out that
obligations and duties are outside the scope of access control.  In
their view roles are a larger concept beyond access control and it is
important to distinguish and recognize the scope of access control
roles in contrast to roles in general.
<p>
Chris Sundt presented a talk on ICL's experiences with deploying RBAC
in actual products and their experience with real users.  Chris noted
that RBAC makes it easy to split the administration of the role-user
relationship from that of the role-permission relationship.  He said
users find this very useful.  He also introduced the notion of an
affiliation whereby a role can be further qualified.  Thus a role of
branch manager could be qualified by an affiliation to a particular
branch thereby conferring branch manager permissions only within that
branch.  This was another facility that ICL found to be popular with
users.
<p>
The second session on "What is RBAC?" concluded with three shorter
talks.  Sylvia Osborne of the University of Western Ontario in Canada
presented an overview of RBAC research by her group.  Among other
things this work has developed algorithms for recognizing redundant
assignment of permissions to roles, as well as algorithms for deletion
and addition of roles in a hierarchy and similar operations.  Luigi
Guiri of Fondazione Ugo Bordoni in Rome, Italy presented an extension
of a model of Baldwin's based on a role as a named protection domain.
Luigi argued that a role should be viewed a set of named protection
domains (and roles).  He presented a role algebra for constructing
such sets based on the notion of and-roles (that are simultaneously
activated) and or-roles (that are mutually exclusive).  For logistical
reasons, the third short talk of this session was actually presented
later but logically belongs in this session where it had been
originally scheduled.  The talk was by Fang Chen who is a student of
mine at George Mason University.  He described some preliminary work
in designing a language to express constraints on components of RBAC.
Mutually exclusive roles, where one user cannot be assigned both
roles, are perhaps the most common example of constraints in RBAC, but
there are also many other useful constraints.
<p>
After lunch, the third session on "What are user needs?" had two
presentations.  The first talk by Yahya Al-Salqan of West Virginia
University described an application of RBAC in the health care domain.
In this project RBAC provided by the Oracle database management system
(DBMS) was being considered as a means to enforce patient privacy and
confidentiality requirements.  Possible extensions to an
inter-organizational environment were also being studied.  The second
talk by Trent Jaeger looked at the possibility of using RBAC in
collaborative systems.  RBAC facilitates the use of least privilege
because different code can be executed with different roles by the
same user.  This makes it safer to use agents supplied by other users,
since these agents can execute on a user's workstation but with
restricted roles.  Further, different roles can be assigned to
different agents depending upon the trust and requirements of these
agents.
<p>
The fourth session consisted of a group exercise developed by Charles
Youman of SETA Corporation.  The exercise was conducted in two
break out groups.  The objective of the exercise was to rank order
different aspects of RBAC with respect to their priority or
importance.  The results indicated that there were some differences in
priorities assigned by individual attendees, but by and large there was
considerable agreement on what the more important aspects were.  This
is an encouraging finding which suggests that there is substantial
consensus within the RBAC community upon which a widely accepted
reference model can be developed.  This concluded the first day.
<p>
The second day began with a number of short talks in a session called
"Available and Emerging Technologies."  LouAnna Notargiacomo of Oracle
Corporation described various aspects of RBAC in Oracle 7 and Trusted
Oracle 7.  Oracle has pioneered the use of roles in relational DBMSs
and these features are being incorporated into SQL standards.  Jeremy
Epstein of Cordant Inc. presented a talk on "NetWare 4 as an Example
of Role Based Access Control."  Jeremy's talk focused on identifying
how Netware can implement the concepts of the RBAC models introduced
earlier in my talk.  Netware has a built-in concept of Organizational
Roles but attaches very little semantics to it beyond that associated
with any other Netware Directory Service object.  Jeremy's finding was
that some aspects of RBAC do translate quite easily on to Netware
roles but others would be difficult to support.  These two talks
demonstrate that there is available technology on popular platforms
that can be used today to support RBAC (at least to some extent).
<p>
The remaining papers in this session addressed emerging technologies.
T.C. Ting of the National Science Foundation (on leave from University
of Connecticut) described ongoing RBAC research at U. Conn. concerned
with implementing RBAC in object-oriented systems.  Their project
seeks to develop RBAC notions consistent with object-oriented conceots
such as encapsulation, information hiding and inheritance.  They have
used a health-care case study in their project.  John Barkley of NIST
gave a talk on "Implementing Role Based Access Control using Object
Technology."  In this project John used a concept of layered objects
to facilitate flexible administration while minimizing impact of role
changes on applications.  A prototype demonstration of these concepts
is available at NIST's RBAC home page (http://waltz.nist.gov/rbac).
Rohan Thomas of Odyssey Research Associates (ORA) presented a talk on
"RBAC and Distributed Object-Based Enterprise Computing."  Roshan
described ongoing work at Odyssey on next-generation security models
that involve RBAC as a component.  Roshan also mentioned ORA's efforts
at including some of these concepts in OMG's CORBA initiative.
<p>
The next session consisted of open discussion on two important issues
in making RBAC practical.  Edward Coyne of SETA Corporation
facilitated discussion on Role Engineering.  The definition of roles,
assignment of permissions to roles and definition of other components
of an RBAC model, is essentially a requirements engineering process.
Attendees agreed that this is an important and complex topic which
should be approached with a engineering methodology.  Charles Youman
of SETA Corporation facilitated discussion on RBAC Transition.  The
question is how to get from here (no RBAC) to there (RBAC)?  Attendees
agreed that RBAC would co-exist with other access control mechanisms.
Moreover, RBAC would need to be deployed incrementally in an
orginazation rather than totally replacing legacy approaches.  Further
details of these two discussion will be available in the Workshop
proceedings.
<p>
After lunch there was a discussion session on "Consensus Reached and
Remaining Issues," moderated by me.  A number of open issues were
enumerated.  The discussion focussed entirely on the most important
which was to define the concept of a role and distinguish it from the
familiar concept of a group in access control.  There was agreement
that the notion of a directory and a file and fairly standard notions
in operating systems (OSs) even though the details do vary from one OS
to another.  Similarly the concept of a group as a collection of users
(and possibly other groups) is well-known in access control systems.
The discussion attempted to develop a notion of role along the same
line.  The concept of a role in access control is currently being used
in two different ways.  Some use role to mean a named collection of
permissions (and possibly other roles).  Others use role to mean a
named collection of permissions and a named collection of users (and
possibly other roles).  The discussion could not reconcile whether one
of these was the "correct" use of the term role.  Further details and
thoughts on this discussion will be provided in the Workshop
proceedings.  It might seem that a discipline that cannot even agree
on the meaning of its key term (role in this case) is in deep trouble.
I am, however, much more optimistic and feel there is substantial
consensus that can overcome these minor disagreements of terminology.
Perhaps the term role can be used in both ways, but we just need to
make clear how it is being used in a given context.  Or perhaps we need
to agree as a community to use two different term for these two
different concepts of a role.  It would be inappropriate to discard
the entire disciple of RBAC just due to some minor disagreement in
basic terminology.
<p>
The final session of the workshop was devoted to discussion of future
plans.  Based on these discussion the Workshop Steering Committee is
planning for a second workshop to be held in the early part of 1997.
<p>
In conclusion I reiterate my earlier statement that the first RBAC
Workshop was successful in its modest goal of taking a the important
first steps towards a consensus reference model for RBAC.  Overall
success of this series will depend upon what happens subsequently.
Anyone interested in being involved should contact me.

<TITLE>Enforcing the CDA Improperly May Pervert Internet Architecture </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<i>[The following note came across my screen recently and I thought it
worth bringing to the attention of Cipher readers.  I found 
the "end-to-end argument" paper a model of clarity and insight,
and this comment has a technical component I haven't seen elsewhere
in the furor the CDA has evoked on the net.--CEL]</i>
<H3>Enforcing the CDA Improperly May Pervert Internet Architecture</H3>
by David P. Reed
<p>
Friends -
<p>
I'd like to call your attention to a situation where misguided politics (of
the "ends-justify-means" sort) threatens one of the fundamental principles
of Internet architecture, in a way that seems like a slippery slope.
I do not normally take public stands of a political nature, and I do not
participate much in Internet architecture anymore, but I'd like to call your
attention to a very severe perversion of the Internet architectural
philosophy that is being carried out in the name of political and commercial
expediency.  No matter what you believe about the issues raised by the
Communications Decency Act, I expect that you will agree that the mechanism
to carry out such a discussion or implement a resolution is in the
agreements and protocols between end users of the network, not in the groups
that design and deploy the internal routers and protocols that they
implement.  I hope you will join in and make suggestions as to the
appropriate process to use to discourage the use of inappropriate
architectural changes to the fundamental routing architecture of the net to
achieve political policy goals.
<p>
As you know, I am one of the authors, along with Saltzer and Clark, of the
paper "End-to-end arguments in decentralized computer systems", which first
characterized in writing the primary approach to the Internet's architecture
since it was conceived, which approach arguably has been one of the reasons
for its exponential growth.  This philosophy - avoid building special
functionality into the net internals solely to enforce an end-to-end policy
- has led to the simplicity, low cost, and radical scalability of the
Internet.  One of the consequences is that IP routers do not enforce
policies on a packet-by-packet basis, so routers can be extremely simple
beasts, compared to the complex beasts that characterize even the simplest
telephone central office switch.  End-to-end policies are implemented by
intelligence at the ends (today, the PCs and servers that communicate over
the many consolidated networks that make up the Internet).
<p>
I just read in <a href=http://www.zdnet.com/intweek/>
Inter@ctive Week</a> (March 25, 1996) that 
<a href=http://www.zdnet.com/intweek/print/960325/upfront/doc7.html>
Livingston plans to
announce an "Exon box"</a> - a router that is designed to enable ISPs to
restrict access to "indecent sites" or unrated sites unless an "adult"
enters an authorization code when opening a session to enable the router to
transmit packets to the site.
<p>
The scam seems to be that Livingston has colluded with Senator Exon's staff
to propose a "solution" to enable ISP's to implement parental controls.
Exon's staff is using the announced solution as an example to demonstrate
how simply ISPs can enforce local community standards and parental controls,
thus supporting interpretations of the CDA requiring all access providers to
include such capability in their boxes.  Exon's staff is quoted as
encouraging ISP's to install such functionality into the routers that serve
as access points for nets.
<p>
Since I use an Ascend P50 ISDN router to make frequent, short,
bandwidth-on-demand ISDN connections from my "Family LAN" to an Ascend
multi-line ISDN router at my commercial Internet Service Provider, I am
worried that this model is completely unworkable for me, and for others that
will eventually use such a practical system.  My family has minor children
and adults who all happily access the Internet.  My ISP has no clue
whatsoever whether a child or adult has initiated the call, and in fact, if
my child and I are both on different computers in different rooms, it is
quite silly to imagine that the Ascend router at the ISP can figure out if
it is me or my child generating each packet.
<p>
It is appalling to me that Livingston, which has some responsibility as a
router provider to assist in the orderly growth of the net, is pandering to
Exon's complete misunderstanding of how the Internet is built.  I would hope
that Ascend, with its much larger share of the ISP market, and other router
companies such as Cisco and Bay Networks, would take a principled and likely
popular position that the "Exon box" is not the way to go about this.  I
would hope that ISP's would in general avoid use of Livingston's products,
and also refuse to cave into Exon's pressure.  I believe, though I may be
wrong, that Livingston has contributed to the RADIUS technology that many
ISP's use to manage dialup access charging in a way that is consistent with
ethe end-to-end philosophy, but any credit they are due is overwhelmed by
the Exon box insanity.
<p>
I do work to protect my children from inappropriate material, but pressure
from Senators to mandate technically flawed solutions, and opportunistic,
poorly thought-through technologies from companies like Livingston are not
helpful.
<p>
If you agree, please join me in attempting to call off any tendency for
other router vendors and protocol designers to develop Exon box features.
It would seem that the appropriate place for content restrictions, such as
"parental controls", are in the end-to-end agreements between content
providers and their users, not in the internal switching architecture of the
net.
<p>

<p>
Notes:
The end-to-end paper was edited and republished in several forms (with
slight variations in title), generalizing its observations to systems beyond
the distributed systems that were its original focus; the final and most
accessible one is: Saltzer, J.H., D.P. Reed, and D.D. Clark, End-To-End
Arguments in System Design. ACM Transactions on Computer Systems, 1984. 2(4)
p. 277-288.
<p>
I don't have any more details on Livingston's technology or its marketing
plans than what was presented in Inter@ctive Week.  The Inter@ctive Week
article apparently based its information on 'sources' describing a planned
announcement, and also quoted Exon's staff.  It is possible that Livingston
will choose not to announce or position its technology in this form.  It
seems less likely that Exon's staff will change its position on forcing
ISP's to adopt some kind of technological solution, however.<br>
- David
<p><i>
[After considering Dr. Reed's comments, I asked him whether he objects
to firewalls in general.  His reply:</i>
<p>
No, I think firewalls of the sort now deployed can be OK (e.g., packet
filters), as a minimal line of defense.  However, they are inherently
flawed, in ways that are well understood (reading Cheswick and Bellovin
gives good insight here).  Most security threats ultimately require
end-to-end policies and must be implemented with end-to-end solutions.  As
the paper points out, sometimes one can optimize cost of implementing and
end-to-end solution by including some functionality that is not end-to-end.
Firewalls may reduce the cost.

Report on the Internet Society
Symposium on Network and Distributed System Security

<H3>
Report on the Internet Society
Symposium on Network and Distributed System Security, San Diego, CA, February 22-23,
1996</H3><br>
by Christoph L. Schuba<br>
(schuba@cs.purdue.edu, schuba@parc.xerox.com)
<p>
The fourth Symposium on Network and Distributed System Security (SNDSS)
was held at the Princess Hotel in San Diego, CA on February 22-23,
1996. This one-track symposium was sponsored by the Privacy and
Security Research Group of the Internet Research Task Force with
support from the Internet Society (ISOC).
<p>
The symposium was well attended, with about 300 registered attendees.
Thursday consisted of four sessions, two of which were panel
discussions. The refereed paper sessions addressed electronic mail
security, distributed object systems, and distributed system security.
The panels discussed scalability of security in distributed object
systems and intellectual property protection. After the dinner
banquet, Henry Kluepfel (Vice President, SAIC) was invited to speak
about "Security and Fraud on the Information Superhighway". The last
scheduled activity for the day was a BOF on security in Java.
<p>
Friday consisted again of four sessions, the last one was a panel
discussion on public-key infrastructure. The other sessions covered
aspects of network security, key management, and encryption.
<p>
The purpose of the symposium is to bring together people who are
building software and/or hardware to provide network and distributed
system security services. It has a focus on practical aspects, such as
actual system design, and implementation. It targets researchers,
implementors, and users of network and distributed systems facilities.
Forty submissions for refereed papers, panels, and BOFs and the work
of the program committee resulted in an outstanding symposium program.

<H3> Thursday, February 22 </H3>
<i>Morning</i>
<p>
James Ellis (general chair, CERT) opened the symposium with welcoming
remarks and thanks to the chairs that brought the symposium together:
Donna Leggett (registration chair), Thomas Hutton (local arrangement
chair), Stephen Welke (publication chair), Clifford Neuman and David
Balenson (Program Chairs), the session chairs Stephen Kent, Danny
Nesset, Michael Roe, Peter Neumann, Matt Bishop, Burt Kaliski, Avi
Rubin, and Warwick Ford, the rest of the Program Committee, and a
number of external reviewers.
<p> 
The first session regarding "Electronic Mail Security" was chaired by
Stephen Kent (BBN) and featured two talks.
<p>
The first talk was given by Ceki Gulcu (IBM) (joint work with Gene
Tsudik) with the title "Mixing E-mail with BABEL". Gulcu discussed
the goals and desired properties of anonymous email, such as
availability of the service to anyone, strong guarantee of anonymity,
minimal trust in remailers, and a remailer infrastructure that can
resist attacks. He then introduced the design and salient features of
the BABEL anonymous remailer. The basic idea is that the sender
repeatedly encrypts the message with the public keys of the remailers
that are on the forward path to the destination. Return path
information is included in the message to enable replies. This
approach has its obvious scalability problems, but is resistant to a
number of active and passive attacks, and assumes little trust in
intermediate remailers. A prototype implementation is based on freely
available software: Perl and PGP.
<p>
The following presentation was given by Kazuhiko Yamamoto (Nara IST,
Japan) who described and demonstrated a design for the "Integration of
PGP and MIME". The advantage is obvious: combining PGP's privacy
services and MIME's capability of exchanging multipart, multimedia
documents offers privacy for any non-textual documents. The design
allows for the embedding of PGP objects into MIME with a backward
compatibility with PGP. It offers confidentiality and authenticity on
a whole MIME message, or only selected parts. A prototype was
implemented in Emacs LISP and is operational on various emacs
platforms.
<p>
The second session in the morning was titled "Distributed Object
Systems". Dan Nessett (Sun Microsystems) chaired this session that
contained one presentation of a refereed paper and one panel
discussion.
<p>
The sole paper in this session was presented by Nicholas Yialelis
(joint work with Morris Sloman, both Imperial College London, UK). He
described a "Security Framework Supporting Domain Based Access Control
in Distributed Systems". Explicit goals of this work are to provide a
security platform for distributed applications that makes access
control and authentication mechanisms transparent to the application
level, and to support the enforcement of access control policies that
are specified using management domains. The latter has the advantage
that policies can be specified in terms of groups of objects.
Therefore it is not necessary to specify policies for possibly
millions of individual objects in large scale systems. The
architecture provides for a host manager server that is present on all
hosts and supports the host manager object, an authentication agent
object, and an access control agent object. The provided security is
transparent to the applications, and only few modifications are
necessary at the applications servers. The components communicate with
their remote peers via secure channels. A prototype implementation is
underway in the CORBA-compliant Orbix environment.
<p>
Bret Hartman (BlackWatch Technology), Dan Nessett, and Nicholas
Yialelis served on the following panel. The objective of the panel was
to discuss the question of "Scalability of Security in Distributed
Object Systems". Hartman began with a brief overview of the problem
area. To manage a set of objects, rather than the individual objects
separately is a powerful mechanism. The challenges include how to
compose policies that are specified on sets of objects, if
compositions can scale in the presence of complex security
requirements, and how different solutions to the previous two
challenges might interoperate. Dan Nessett provided three example
applications of large scale distributed object systems to explore the
applicability and advantages of security policy domains. The examples
addressed the question of federated domains, federated domains with
transitive trust requirements, and security policy updates. The first
two examples centered around the insight that technical solutions are
necessary but not sufficient to provide good security. The search for
higher level solutions must go on, and a true solution will in
addition to technical aspects have many other facets, such as
nondisclosure agreements, trust, object domains, ...and lots of
lawyers.
<p>
<i>Afternoon</i>
<p>
The third session was on "Distributed System Security". Michael Roe
(University of Cambridge, UK) chaired this session.
<p>
Jonathan Trostle (CyberSAFE) spoke first, about "A Flexible
Distributed Authorization Protocol" (joint work with Clifford Neuman,
ISI). The work is based on the observation that considerable effort
has been put into creating interoperability among authentication
methods, but authorization methods have received far less attention.
Trostle presented a flexible authorization protocol that provides the
full generality of restricted proxies while supporting the
functionality of and interoperability with existing authorization
models, such as OSF DCE, and SESAME V2.
<p>
Trent Jaeger (University of Michigan) presented "Preserving Integrity
in Remote File Location and Retrieval" (joint work with Avi Rubin,
Bellcore). Jaeger's work addresses the two problems of locating files
and verification of file integrity in the presence of untrusted
networks, or mobile systems with little memory. He described a service
that provides the capability to automatically locate, retrieve, and
verify files specified by a client using a single trusted principal, a
certification authority (CA). CAs generate and sign certificates that
associate an author with a file and a cryptographic digest of the
file. Automated location is possible because all remote files are
published with location servers.
<p>
Takahiro Kiuchi (University of Tokyo) presented the final speech in
this session titled "C-HTTP - The Development of a Secure, Closed
HTTP-Based Network on the Internet" (joint work with his colleague
Shigekoto Kaihara). The components of the system are a client-side
proxy, a server-side proxy, and a C-HTTP name server. Client-side
proxies and server-side proxies communicate with each other using a
secure encrypted protocol while communication between a user agent and
its client-side proxy or an origin server and server-side proxy are
performed using current HTTP/1.0. The C-HTTP based secure, encrypted
name and certification service is used, instead of the DNS. The aim of
C-HTTP is to assure institutional level security, in contrast to other
secure HTTP protocols currently proposed which are oriented toward
secure end-user to end-user HTTP communications.
<p>


The last session of the day, "Intellectual Property Protection", was
chaired by Peter Neumann (SRI). The panel consisted of brief
presentations by the panelists and a question and answer session. Olin
Sibert (Electronic Publishing Resources) proposed a decentralized
approach to electronic publishing of intellectual property. Components
of such an approach are decentralized servers, 'crypto (un)lock'
technology for making documents (in)accessible, and 'local'
participation and enforcement of end systems. Olin also advocated the
view that in the business world security requirements differ from
military requirements. Russ Housley (Spyrus) represented a vendor of
PCMCIA crypto hardware for metering remote use. Dan Boneh (Princeton
University) described a method of using public key cryptography to
mark complex documents, such as images, to allow the owner of the
document to identify each authorized copy and its owner. The scheme
can protect against collusion. It fails if automated tools can be
utilized to remove the protecting fingerprints, such as spacing in
text documents. A number of different topics were addressed during the
following question and answer period. Peter Neumann asked if
electronic commerce products can be made secure? The joint opinion of
all panelists concluded that this is impossible, and that the real
question is how to make the publishing systems resilient enough, such
that fraud is limited to an acceptable level. The remaining questions
centered around Boneh's work on fingerprinting documents. It was asked
if the assumption that products can be associated with the initial
purchaser is reasonable, and if so, how much this violates personal
privacy issues. The last question discussed if there are methods of
fingerprinting that do not affect the artistic contents of the work.



<H3>Friday, February 23</H3>
<i>Morning</i>
<p>
The first session on the second day on "Network Security" was chaired
by Matt Bishop (UC Davis). This session included three presentations.
<p>
Jonathan Stone (Stanford University) described "Designing an Academic
Firewall: Policy, Practice, and Experiences with SURF" (joint work
with colleagues Michael Greenwald, Sandeep Singhal, and David
Cheriton). The interesting premise of this work was that corporate
firewall designs are neither effective nor appropriate for academic or
corporate research environments. The research group built the Stanford
University Research Firewall (SURF). The policy implemented by this
firewall allows less restrictive outward information flow than the
traditional model. Services, such as e-mail, WWW, and anonymous FTP
work transparently for internal users. SURF was constructed using
off-the-shelf software and hardware components.
<p>
Secondly, Sandra Murphy (TIS) described "Digital Signature Protection
of the OSPF Routing Protocol" (joint work with colleague Madelyn
Badger). The talk reported on work in progress to protect the OSPF
routing protocol through the use of cryptography, specifically digital
signatures. The routing information is signed with an asymmetric
cryptographic algorithm, allowing each router recipient to check the
source and integrity of the information. Murphy discussed fundamental
issues in security of routing protocols, reviewed the basics of OSPF
operation, the proposed design, and remaining vulnerabilities (such as
the age field not being protected by the keyed hash).
<p>
Michael Roe (University of Cambridge, UK) concluded the session by his
"Case Study of Secure ATM Switch Booting" in the context of the
Fairisle ATM switch environment (joint work with his colleague
Shaw-Cheng Chuang). Roe examined a few techniques for booting
Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) switches securely over an insecure
network. Each of the techniques assumed a different trust model. The
work assumes an open multi-service network where ATM switches are
booted with third party software, possibly even using a third party
booting service. In that environment it is important to ensure that
the switches are booted with authorized and authenticated boot code.
Michael examined the threats and presented schemes of countering the
threats.
<p>

The sixth session of the symposium was on "Key Management", chaired by
Burt Kaliski (RSA).
<p>
Hugo Krawczyk (IBM T.J. Watson) began with a discussion of "SKEME, A
Versatile Secure Key Exchange Mechanism for Internet". SKEME
constitutes a compact protocol that supports a variety of realistic
scenarios and security models over the Internet. It provides clear
tradeoffs between security and performance as required by the
different scenarios without incurring unnecessary system complexity.
The protocol supports key exchange based on public keys, key
distribution centers, or manual installation, and provides for fast
and secure key refreshment. Additionally, SKEME selectively provides
perfect forward secrecy, allows for replaceability and negotiation of
the underlying cryptographic primitives, and addresses privacy issues
as anonymity and repudiatability.
<p>
The final talk before lunch was given by Carlisle Adams (BNR, Canada)
on "IDUP and SPKM: Developing Public-Key Based APIs and Mechanisms for
Communication Security Services". Carlisle discussed the progress in
the development of APIs and mechanisms which provide a comprehensive
set of security services to application developers. Existing APIs,
though similar, are developed for distinct environments: the session
API (GSS) is aimed at the on-line real-time messaging environment; the
store-and-forward API (IDUP) is particularly suited for
electronic-mail types of environments. Both APIs were designed to be
easy to use, yet with appropriate public-key-based mechanisms include
many necessary services for communication security, such as data
origin authentication, data confidentiality, data integrity, and
support for non-repudiation. A full key management and certification
infrastructure can be provided by implementations of these
APIs/mechanisms in a way which is completely transparent to the
calling application, thus ensuring maximum flexibility and scalability
to future environments.
<p>
<i>Afternoon</i>
<p>
Avi Rubin (Bellcore) opened the seventh session on "Encryption",
encompassing three presentations.
<p>
Iskender Agi (SRI) presented "An Empirical Study of Secure MPEG Video
Transmissions" (joint work with colleague Li Gong). MPEG is an
industrial strength standard for video processing and is widely used
in multimedia applications in the Internet. No security provision is
specified in the standard. The speakers conducted an experimental
study of previously proposed selective encryption schemes for MPEG
video security. This study showed that these methods are inadequate
for sensitive applications. Agi also discussed the tradeoffs between
levels of security and computational and compression efficiency.
<p>
The second presentation titled "Parallelized Network Security
Protocols" described a joint effort by Erich Nahum, David J. Yates
(both University of Massachusetts), Sean O'Malley, Hillarie Orman, and
Richard Schroeppel (all University of Arizona). The premise is that
shared-memory multiprocessors make attractive server platforms. The
paper is an experimental performance study that examines how
encryption protocol performance can be improved using parallelism. The
authors show linear speedup for several different Internet-based
cryptographic protocol stacks running on a symmetric shared-memory
multiprocessor using two different approaches to parallelism.
<p>
The last presentation was by David A. Wagner (UC Berkeley) who spoke
about a TCP/IP security extension for MS-DOS systems "A 'Bump in the
Stack' Encryptor for MS_DOS Systems" (joint work with Steven Bellovin,
AT&T Bell Labs). Source code is not readily available for MS-DOS
systems. Therefore, Wagner implemented the IP security extensions
using the packet driver interface. The IPSEC module sits between the
generic Ethernet driver and the hardware driver; it emulates each to
the other. The work showed that it is possible to add IP security
features by exploiting open interfaces. However, the implementation
has several problems, such as the duplication of functionality (IP
fragmentation).
<p>
The final session of the symposium was a panel on "Public-Key
Infrastructure". Chair and moderator Warwick Ford (BNR) introduced the
panel members and gave brief comments on the importance of the topic.
He also acknowledged that the subject was too broad, and restricted it
to the question of how many credentials are needed. The panelists gave
short presentations and answered several questions from the audience.
John Wankmueller (MasterCard International) stressed one point in his
presentation: MasterCard and VISA take a different approach to
certification than most other other systems: they try to establish
that a valid account is used, not the identity of the user.
Authenticating account numbers is in a sense obscuring the identity of
users. Wankmueller then presented the architecture of a certification
hierarchy that was developed to secure MasterCard electronic commerce
transactions. Taher ElGamal (Netscape) focussed on the importance of
user friendly and transparent security features. It therefore did not
matter how many certificates were needed, if all the user has to do is
to click on an icon to commit to a transaction, and the software
beneath it determines which certificate is needed. There will most
likely be a multitude of certificates: identity type, authorization
type, and special purpose certificates. Universal certificates are
possible to design, but complicated. Different countries have
different styles (e.g., phone cards). ElGamal claimed that a likely
outcome is to have about as many important certificates as plastic
cards in one's wallet. Michael Baum (Verisign) represented the
commercial public-key infrastructure service provider perspective. He
asked if the lack of a single certificate is really a problem. He
focussed on the practices and the legal side. The remainder of the
time was spent with questions from the floor. Steve Kent observed that
there is no need for multiple credentials not only because of
different types of identity, but also because of context of identity.
Bob Abbott challenged the trust in the system by asking what recourse
customers have against fraudulent merchants.

<i>Sessions reported by Charlie Payne:</i>
<p>
Amid the glamour and pomp of old New Orleans, the Annual Computer
Security Applications Conference (ACSAC '95) convened for its eleventh
conference.  Paul Strassman of SAIC was the Keynote Speaker, and Bob
Courtney of Robert Courtney Company presented the Distinguished
Lecture.  While the conference covered many of the traditional INFOSEC
topics, e.g., cryptography, database security and applications of
formal methods, it was clear that securing the Internet was the hot
topic, with cost-effective methods for assurance a close second.
<p>
Paul Strassman opened the conference with a call to top management to
take personal responsibility for information security in their
organizations.  Too often, he insisted, the task is delegated to
techies.  Strassman advocated a security organization based on systems
of governance so that there is separation of power.  The executive
committee is the legislative branch, while the operating management is
the executive branch.  Strassman stressed that only operating
management, with its direct responsibility for profits, should be
charged with trade-offs between security and other concerns.  The
judicial branch arises from the requirement that organization enforce
standards.  Strassman address concluded with some "bumper stickers":
<ul>
<li>Look only to yourself for security responsibility.
<li>Security mismanagement is the art of making a bad situation worse.
<li>There is an untested presumption by everyone that they are
in control.
<li>Any one of a thousand employees can plunge an organization
into disaster.
<li>Never mistake for treachery what simple incompetence can explain.
</ul>
<p>
Bob Courtney spoke next.  He proposed that the 1996 conference
committee arrange a debate between Strassman and him.  He didn't
elaborate on the points of disagreement; instead, he decried
organizations for not understanding what they are trying protect.
We're not doing a good job of defining the problem, he said, because
protecting the integrity of information is a far greater problem than
ensuring its confidentiality.  Integrity is the property of data
(or anything) "being no worse than you think it is".  Access control is 
a poor countermeasure for protecting integrity because individuals are 
not held accountable.  He advocated widening the internal auditor's 
scope to include all business processes and controls.
<p>
At the conclusion of the opening session, Marshall Abrams of The MITRE
Corp.  announced that "LAFS: A Logging and Auditing File System" by
Christopher Wee of the University of California, Davis, won the student
paper award.  Later in the conference it was announced that a team of
authors from the Naval Research Laboratory won the outstanding paper award
with their submission,
<a href=
"http://www.itd.nrl.navy.mil/ITD/5540/publications/CHACS/index1995.html">
Improving Inter-Enclave Information Flow for a
Secure Strike Planning Application"</a.>.

(postscript)</a>
The conference was presented in three tracks: two technical
presentation tracks and a vendor track.  The summaries below address
only the technical presentation tracks that this reviewer attended.

<p>
<H4>Wednesday late morning - Track A: Firewalls</H4>
<p>
Jeremy Epstein of Cordant, Inc. introduced the three presentations: two
described applications of firewall technology, while the third
presentation described the secure remote control of uninterruptible
power supply systems.
<p>
In "A Community of Firewalls: An Implementation Example", Dan Woycke of
The MITRE Corp. described a new, firewall-based architecture for the
Open Source Information System (OSIS), which is an unclassified
confederation of systems serving the intelligence community.  The old
architecture did not support direct connection between the internal
network and the Internet, and each node required strong
authentication.  After considering encrypting routers and managed IP
service, MITRE settled on a hybrid approach: virtual private networks.
The new architecture stresses usability and connectivity between nodes
while retaining an acceptable level of security.  It permits WWW
between OSIS nodes.  MITRE concludes that virtual private networks
provide node-to-node connectivity and Internet connectivity while
reducing the need for strong authentication.
<p>
In "Sidewinder: Combining Type Enforcement and UNIX", Dan Thomsen of
Secure Computing Corp. described how Type Enforcement and other
mechanisms were added to BSDi UNIX to create the company's firewall
product.  Four primary features were added: an administration kernel,
to which there is no access from the network; an operational kernel,
which enforces Type Enforcement and access to the administration
kernel; triggers for detecting malicious behavior; and controlled
system calls.  Finally, Thomsen summarized the results of the initial
Sidewinder Challenge, for which there were no successful penetration
attacks.
<p>
Gerd Enste of debis Systemhaus, Germany, concluded this session with
his presentation on the "Secure Remote Control and Adminstration of
Uninterruptible Power Supply-Systems with SNMP".  The primary threats
are message modification and replay attacks. Message disclosure is not
a major threat because the content of the control messages may be
publicly known.  Denial of service attacks are indistinguishable from
ordinary network failures.  The solution is a modified protocol that
uses monotonic counters instead of synchronized clocks and a
cryptographic algorithm for generating a message authentication code
that is changed for every session or message.
<p>

<H4>Wednesday early afternoon - Track B: Forum</H4>
<p>
Steve LaFountain of NSA moderated a forum titled "Experiences Using the
Common Criteria (CC) to Develop Protection Profiles (PP) and Security
Targets".  Forum participants were Bernard Roussely of the NATO Office
of Security, Leslie LaFountain of NSA, Jon Millen of The MITRE Corp.,
and Ken Elliot of The Aerospace Corp.  Version 1.0 of the CC will be
available in January 1996, with another version appearing a year
later.
<p>
Roussely described NATO's efforts to develop PPs for NATO critical
systems, including a PP with C2 features (plus information labels) and
B1 assurance as well as a PP for a firewall.  He concluded that product
PPs should be developed from system PPs, and that a method is needed to
design PPs from system requirements.  Roussely liked the rich database
of information that appears in part 2 of the CC, but he faulted the
perceived gap between a system's security objectives and the PP
components.  He also noted that the granularity of the components was
often inappropriate.
<p>
Leslie LaFountain described NSA's goal to develop generic high and low
assurance PPs for operating systems.  Overall she found the CC to be
very flexible and to provide useful guidance on the dependencies
between features and assurance.  However, the documentation
requirements may be overwhelming, and some requirements, such as for
assurance of modularity, are still too poorly stated.
<p>
Millen developed a PP for an application-level firewall with user
authentication, access control and auditing.  While most of the needed
requirements were present in the CC, there was no requirement for
exporting audit data.  In addition, he would have liked a special
interpretation of subjects and objects for clients and services,
respectively, and support for different authentication mechanisms.
Millen concluded that the Common Criteria needed improvement in the
area of refinement.
<p>
Elliot relayed his experience developing B2-level PPs.  He shared
Roussely's frustration with component granularity.  He also noted that
the profile structure is not backward-compatible with the TCSEC.  In
general, the CC is still too large and too informal.  However, it does
provide a common language for expressing requirements, and it is
flexible and extensible.  Outstanding issues seem to be the unnecessary
dependencies between components, the duplication of functionality and
the identification of a process for profile assessment.
<p>
One audience member noted that the CC is just the TCSEC in more shades
of colors; instead a PP should be something the vendor provides to make
claims about what is built.  Another individual noted that the utility
of the CC is still unknown since only evaluators and accreditors have
developed PPs.
<p>
<H4>Wednesday late afternoon - Track A: Trusted Distribution Systems</H4>
<p>
In the final session of the day, Emilie Siarkiewicz of Rome Laboratory
moderated technical presentations on trusted distributed systems.
<p>
In "The Triad System: The Design of a Distributed, Real-Time Trusted
System", John Sebes of Trusted Information Systems, Inc. described the
addition of real-time features to B3 Trusted Mach (TMach).  The system
is so-named because it merges three areas of operating system
functionality: multilevel security, real-time, and distributed
processing.  Triad's security functions are provided by the TMach
system and by a distributed interprocess communication (IPC) mechanism
for propagating security data between hosts.  Real-time extensions were
made to the Mach microkernel and to the TMach servers.  Enforcing the
security policy depends on attaching security ID tags (of the sending
task) to each IPC and interpreting the tags at each node in the
system.  A prototype operating system has been produced.  TIS believes
the architecture is ideal for CORBA security.
<p>
In "Immediacy (and Consistency) in Distributed Trusted Systems", Gary
Grossman of Cordant, Inc. pondered the meaning of "immediacy" for
distributed systems.  The term refers to the latency between the time
of check and the time of use.  For local systems, an action is
considered "immediate" if it occurs within a bounded period, or if it
occurs before some other action that could be affected by the change.
However, that definition fails for distributed systems.  If a security
database is replicated and distributed, immediacy and consistency will
conflict, and immediacy must take priority.  In fact, the Trusted
Network Interpretation (TNI) of the TCSEC refers to "indeterminate
delays" instead of "immediacy".  Grossman concludes that immediacy
should only be a local system requirement, not a distributed system
requirement.
<p>
Thomas Darr of CTA, Inc., concluded the session with a presentation on
"Multilevel Security Issues in Real-Time Embedded Systems".  He
discussed the issues and problems in applying existing security
technology, guidance and criteria to real-time embedded computer
systems with multilevel security requirements, including finding
suitable security models, identifying and characterizing the "TCB", the
requirements for mandatory access controls, label mechanisms and
authentication mechanisms, and the interpretation of security assurance
requirements.  He recommended closer ties between research and
acquisition organizations and suggested further research in threat and
risk-based rationales for real-time embedded system security
mechanisms.

<p>
<H4>Thursday late morning - Track B: Forum</H4>
<p>
Charles Payne of Secure Computing Corp. moderated a forum titled "Roads
to Assurance".  Forum participants included Doug Landoll of Arca
Systems, Inc., David Ferraiolo of NIST, Jody Heaney of The MITRE Corp,
John Adams of NSA, and Jan Filsinger of Trusted Information Systems.
<p>
Landoll set the tone for the other presentations with a framework for
understanding, comparing and reasoning about assurance methods.  The
framework, which was introduced at the 1995 Workshop on Information
Technology Assurance and Trustworthiness (WITAT), considers an
assurance method in three dimensions: assurance type (correctness,
effectiveness, usability, workmanship), assurance source (system,
process, people, environment), and assurance technique (evidence
production, evidence evaluation).
<p>
Ferraiolo discussed criteria-based assurance methods, focusing
primarily on the Common Criteria.  The Common Criteria, whose merits
were discussed earlier at this conference (see the forum above,
"Experiences Using the Common Criteria to Develop Protection Profiles
and Security Targets") define a set of components for expressing the
assurance requirements for products and systems.  The Criteria are
consistent with the TCSEC (US), ITSEC (EC) and CTCPEC (Canada).  In
terms of Landoll's assurance framework, the Common Criteria address
the correctness and effectiveness of a product or system through
evidence production and evaluation.
<p>
Heaney considered the contribution of process-based methods to
assurance.  The two most popular methods in use, the Software
Engineering Institute's Capability Maturity Model (CMM) for Software
and ISO 9000, have spawned a new generation of process-based
assessments, including the System Engineering CMM, the System Security
Engineering CMM and the Acquisition Maturity Model.  Process-based
assessments not only improve the process but the product as well;
however, they require significant management support.  Heaney
questioned whether the proposed assurance framework adequately captures
process improvement and the dependencies between pieces of assurance
evidence.
<p>
Adams described a recent NSA thrust to develop the Trusted Capability
Maturity Model (TCMM).  The TCMM model is the marriage of the CMM for
Software and the Trusted Software Development Methodology (TSDM).  The
TSDM describes a development process for building software with a high
degree of assurance that it is free from inadvertant errors or
malicious code.  The TCMM is a technique that yields quantitative
measures of both process maturity and compliance with developmental
principles that increase the trustworthiness of software.  NSA's goal
for the project is to replace several assessments (e.g., process-based,
product-oriented, etc.) with a single assessment. The project went from
ideas to results in only eight months.
<p>
Filsinger concluded the formal segment of the forum discussion with an
assessment of certification and accreditation methods.  C&A is unique
in that it is a lifecycle assurance process, and the certifier is a
consumer of the assurance evidence produced by the techniques described
above.  It requires claims about the operational environment and
remains in effect throughout the lifecycle of the system.
<p>
An audience member noted that the success of any of these techniques
still relies heavily on the pedigree of the organization.  Another
individual questioned why the commercial sector would ever undergo
security process improvement.  The answer, of course, lies in the
financial reward for taking this road.  Finally, someone asked if the
NSA planned to combine the TCMM and the SSE-MM (both funded by
NSA).  Adams responded that this issue was still unresolved.
<p>
<H4>Thursday early afternoon - Track A: Intrusion Detection</H4>
<p>
Vince Reed of The MITRE Corp. moderated a technical presentation
session on recent efforts in intrusion detection technology.
<p>
In "Monitoring and Controlling Suspicious Activity in Real-time With
IP-Watcher", Michael Neumann of En Garde Systems described a program
that allows the security administrator to monitor network logons in
real-time, record only the relevant streams of data as evidence, and
control the intruder by terminating or assuming control of his
connection.  Readers can get more information on the product at URL
http://nad.infostructure.com/watcher.html.
<p>
In "Addressing Threats in World Wide Web Technology", Kraig Meyer of
The Aerospace Corp. discussed threats inherent in the use of World Wide
Web (WWW) technology, including disclosure, modification, fabrication
and repudiation.  Security services are available to address these
threats at several architectural levels.  None of the commercial
security solutions currently being developed for Web security (e.g.,
SSL, SHTTP and DCE Web), however, appear to both completely address the
computer security issues and be easily integrated into legacy
environments.
<p>

<H4>Friday early morning - Track A: Assurance</H4>
<p>
Moderated by Marshall Abrams of The MITRE Corp., this session included
presentations on the Trust Technology Assessment Program (TTAP),
managing risk in software systems, and new perspectives on combining
assurance evidence.
<p>
In "A New Perspective on Combining Assurance Evidence", Jay Kahn of The
MITRE Corp. described an assurance evidence framework that is designed
to reduce the cost of assurance while improving the chances of success
for trusted system integration.  The framework seeks to produce
evidence that is useful, understandable, and that can be generalized
and extended to provide insight into the system as a whole.  The
framework has three properties: it can be applied over the system
lifecycle, it provides a structure for contingency planning, and it
provides the ability to perform tradeoffs.  It treats assurance
evidence as products and focuses on their interfaces.
<p>
<H4>Friday late morning - Track A: Formal Tools</H4>
<p>
Moderated by Klaus Keus of the German Information Security Agency, this
session included presentations on a method for specifying the
interfaces for a C2 system, tools for developing trusted applications,
and the Verification Support Environment (VSE).
<p>
In "A Semi-Formal Method for Specification of Interfaces to a C2
System", Jeremy Epstein of Cordant Inc., described a semi-formal
security semantics for describing TCB interfaces.  The security
semantics was applied to two existing products (Novell's Netware and
Cordant's Assure) to build a C2 component with over 500 TCB entry
points.  Using the technique, Cordant discovered many security flaws
and undocumented interfaces in the underlying products; however, they
were disappointed with the steep learning curve required, the
difficulty of maintaining consistency between authors and with the
code, and the semantics' support for testing.  In retrospect, Cordant
would have put more emphasis on training, and they would have based the
semantics on a real programming language rather than pseudo-code.
Overall the effort was worthwhile since it forced analysts and
developers to understand what was security-relevant in the system, and
while the effort might seem great for a C2 system, the authors felt
that the semantics helped illuminate a complex discretionary access
control (DAC) policy.

<p>
<H4>Track B: Security Engineering</H4>
<p>
The session on Security Engineering, chaired by Ron Ross, Institute for
Defense Analyses, presented two interesting and complementary papers in
the area of security metrics and trusted software reuse. Leading off
the session, Mark Aldrich, GRC Inc. presented his paper "Trusted
Software, Repositories and Reuse" in which he made several observations
and recommendations regarding the ability of system developers to reuse
trusted software that would reside in public repositories. He provided
current approaches used to identify specific components that are
candidates for reuse (described as domain analysis) and described six
different categories of assets that could be reused, (i.e., program
source code, design specification, plans, documentation, experience and
specialized expertise, and meta information about assets). The speaker
then discussed the various complications introduced by sharing trusted
code based on differing security policies of the systems desiring to
take advantage of reuse.  He concluded that reuse of components could
be very beneficial if employed correctly. Special consideration must be
given to ensuring that the concept of trust is not focused on a single
aspect of a component such as the source code or documentation, but
instead reflects a continuing thread of trust extending from the
original security policy down through the machine code executing on the
target system.
<p>
Following the reuse presentation, Deb Bodeau, Mitre Corporation,
presented her paper, "INFOSEC Metrics: Issues and Future Directions".
She began her presentation with a survey of current INFOSEC metrics, 
including COMPUSEC metrics, COMSEC metrics, personnel security metrics,
and risk metrics. She also discussed the critical area of information
valuation or the determination of asset values as part of the risk
management process. She then presented the three forms of security
metrics, (i.e., ranking, qualitative, and dollar equivalent) and the
pros and cons of each. Building on her previous definitions and
discussion, the speaker next provided some recommendations to security
engineers and architects needing to use security metrics. These
recommendations focused on selecting the appropriate level of
abstraction for the metric, understanding the target audience, (i.e.,
person receiving the resulting information from the metric), and
providing the correct scope for the metric.  She concluded her
presentation by providing several goals for INFOSEC metrics to ensure
the utility of current, emerging, and new metrics. These include
integrating discipline-specific INFOSEC metrics, providing common
language spanning organizational boundaries, closing the gap between
risk management and security engineering, and producing scalable
metrics that can be targeted to systems of varying complexity.
<p>
<H4>Track B: The System Security Engineering Capability Maturity Model:
Does It Provide Appropriate System Assurance</H4>
<p>
This panel session, chaired by Rick Hefner, TRW Corporation, addressed
the continuing controversial topic of using developmental assurance
techniques to achieve requisite assurances about products and systems
in lieu of the more traditional approaches involving system evaluation
and certification.  Specifically, the panel, consisting of Aaron Cohen,
CSE, Milan Kuchta, CSE, John Adams, NSA, and Bill Wilson, ARCA Systems,
Inc., presented position statements regarding the use of the System
Security Engineering Capability Maturity Model (SSECMM) as an assurance
alternative or supplement. John Adams discussed the NSA effort to
develop an assurance framework which includes a variety of sources to
include the SSECMM. The use of the SSECMM will provide NSA a more cost
effective and timely alternative to achieving product and system
assurance and facilitate the widespread use of commercial off-the shelf
products. Aaron Cohen stressed the importance of developmental
assurance as an alternative approach and indicated that the new Common
Criteria addresses this aspect of assurance. He also stressed the need
to understand the relationship among the various types of assurances
and highlighted the continuing controversy within the evaluation
community regarding the sufficiency of developmental assurance when
applied to products. Milan Kuchta focused on understanding the specific
capabilities and limitations of the SSECMM to ensure community
awareness that developmental assurance will not address all aspects of
assurance and trustworthiness. Bill Wilson stressed the increased
sophistication and frequency of attacks on systems and that products
containing only security features without appropriate assurances, are
highly vulnerable to attack and easily defeated. He also talked about
the benefits of organizations viewing security from a broad perspective
relying on sound security analysis, from the initial requirements phase
through the design, development, and implementation phases.


<p>
<H4>Track B: Access Control</H4>
<p>
This session provided an interesting contrast between role-based access
control issues and a logging and auditing file system. Christopher Wee,
University of California, Davis, presented his paper, "LAFS: A Logging
and Auditing File System", which describes an extension to the
traditional Unix-based file system with a policy-directed security
logging and audit analysis for non-privileged users. LAFS allows users
to specify a security policy and assists users in the configuration of
file system protection mechanisms. The system also logs file accesses
and audits the file access logs against the user-specified security
policy. These activities are all done in a mode that is transparent to
the user.  The principal difference in LAFS auditing versus the more
traditional auditing mechanisms is the level of granularity of the
audit. LAFS limits the audit capability to files only, and does not
allow any finer grain monitoring of objects within the system. The
user-specified security policy is derived from a policy language that
uses predicate logic and regular expressions. The language facilitates
expression of Clark-Wilson style integrity policies. The speaker also
described prototype implementations of the LAFS system on a variety of
common platforms.
<p>
Dave Ferraiolo, National Institute of Standards and Technology,
presented his paper, "Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Features and
Motivations", which began with a detailed description of the role-based
access control paradigm. He discussed the central aspects of RBAC and
the relationship between users, subjects, roles, objects and
operations. Next, he described the notion of role hierarchies, role
authorization, role activation, and separation of duty providing formal
rules to specify the interaction among entities. By administratively
associating access permissions with roles and making users members of
those roles, the management of authorizations within the system is
simplified. This provides a greater flexibility in the specification
and enforcement of organizational security policies and greatly reduces
the cost of security management. After a detailed presentation of the
formal aspects of RBAC, the speaker stated that while certain
commercial vendors have implemented RBAC features, there is still
confusion within the community on precise definitions of RBAC
functionality. He mentioned several research efforts that have been
initiated to better define RBAC features and the capabilities and
limitations of the approach.
<p>
<p4>Track A: Assurance</H4>
<p>
Julie Connolly, Mitre Corporation, presented a paper, "The Trust
Technology Assessment Program and Benefits to U.S. Evaluation", in
which she described the changing paradigm of trusted product
evaluations. Currently, all trusted product evaluations in the U.S. are
performed by the Government at the National Computer Security Center
(NCSC). Under the emerging Trust Technology Assessment Program (TTAP),
selected evaluations would be conducted by commercially-licensed
evaluation facilities. The goals of the new program include an increase
in the number of evaluated products available to the community, shorter
and more timely evaluations, and the framework for mutual recognition
and international reciprocity of evaluations. The speaker also
described the TTAP implementation plan which initially focuses on using
Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC) and an evaluation
methodology based largely on the current Trusted Product Evaluation
Program (TPEP). Stating the eventual goal of moving from TCSEC and TPEP
to the Common Criteria and associated methodology, the speaker
emphasized the need to increase the availability of commercial products
and keep the focus of the commercial evaluations on lower levels of
assurance.  The speaker also provided a brief status report on current
TTAP activities including the prototype experimental evaluation and
then outlined, in detail, the expected benefits TTAP will bring to the
U.S. evaluation community. These benefits included defined and
consistent evaluation procedures, shorter evaluation schedules, more
timely evaluations, more evaluated products, increased access to
evaluations, increased vendor flexibility, and smoother transition to
the Common Criteria.
<p>
Sharon Fletcher presented an interesting an informative paper entitled
"Understanding and Managing Risk in Software Systems", in which she
described a risk assessment methodology and toolset developed for
software systems involved in safety-critical, security-critical, or
mission-critical activities. The methodology introduced a framework for
defining perceived risk and desired risk reduction within the context
of a risk identification matrix. A system risk model captures the
interactions and effectiveness of risk mitigators (or barriers) within
a risk mitigators matrix. The purpose is to define an overall process
for an analyst to develop a system risk model using the risk ID and
mitigators matrices to guide the effort and provide essential
information.  Analysts perform a barrier analysis and threat analysis
for each identified threat. An analysis engine determines the remaining
risk within the system given the stated conditions. The model also has
the ability to use cost information as part of the overall analysis
effort.

<TITLE>Report on the Defensive Information Warfare Symposium, New Orleans, December 11-12 1995</TITLE>
<H3>Report on the Defensive Information Warfare Symposium, New Orleans, 
December 11-12 1995</H3>
by Cynthia Irvine, Naval Postgraduate School
<p>
A few years ago I watched a film about an adolescent computer whiz who
broke into a sensitive military command and control system and wreaked
havoc before being identified and subdued. Those were the good old
days. Then hacking was an arcane art requiring a high level of
technical skill and was accomplished using dumb terminal interfaces.
Perhaps that scenario was never particularly realistic, but now modern
hackers come in many varieties and have a vast array of tools at their
disposal.  Novice hackers now have at their fingertips the tools to
hijack sessions, run sweepers and sniffers, perform stealth
diagnostics, and engage in packet spoofing attacks.  They even have
nice GUIs for point and click hacking.  What does this mean for the
officers in charge of today's command and control system?  A much
greater vulnerability to attack.
<p>
On December 11 and 12, 1995, the Defense Information Security Agency/
Center for Information System Security (DISA/CISS) and the Air
Intelligence Agency/Air Force Information Warfare Center (AIA/AFWIC)
jointly sponsored a symposium on Defensive Information Warfare
(INFOWAR).  For the 200 attendees at the New Orleans meeting, the fact
that several participants were called away to work on aspects of
increased U.S. involvement in the Balkan region merely emphasized the
increasing importance of information warfare.
<p>
Joan Pohly and her associates at DISA/CISS put together an interesting
series of presentations which helped to define the problem and illustrated
ongoing defensive IW efforts.  Highlights of the meeting are reported here.
<p>
From the outset, it was clear that, of the services, the Air Force
has made the greatest effort to address information warfare problems.
The Air Force supports an impressive range of programs of which a few
are:  emergency response teams, automated security profiling tools,
distributed intrusion detection systems, and security prototyping
facilities. 
<p>
So, what is ``Information Warfare?''  The unclassified definition is:
Actions taken to achieve information superiority in support of national
military strategy by affecting adversary information and information
systems while leveraging and protecting our information and information
systems.  In his keynote address, MG David J. Kelley, Vice Director of
DISA, emphasized that information is a critical aspect of modern
warfare.  The battlespace presented to warfighters is dynamic and
requires interoperability between systems for command and control,
transmission of information, messaging, and processing. MG Kelley
described how the Global Command and Control System, Defense
Information System Network, Defense Message System, and Global Combat
Support System will combine to provide a real time view of the combat
situation with concurrent visibility of assets such as logistics,
finance, and procurement.  This defense information infrastructure will
include air, land, and sea,  as well as space-borne assets, and will
require protection of critical portions of the frequency spectrum.
Thus defensive information warfare specifically includes those
``measures to protect friendly information systems by preserving the
availability, integrity and confidentiality of the systems and the
information contained within those systems.''
<p>
As emphasized by MG Kelly and subsequent speakers, including Col.
Kenneth Ritchart and Sarah Jane League, both of DISA/CISS, DoD now
relies on an infrastructure of networked information systems and that
infrastructure is vulnerable. Not only do teenaged hackers pose a
threat, but there are dangers from criminal elements, malicious
insiders, those engaged in industrial and economic espionage, foreign
powers, and terrorists.  Highly technical powers, such as the developed
nations, are particularly vulnerable to attacks on their information
infrastructures.  These attacks have the following attributes:  
<ul>
<li>they
are low cost, in that only a few computers and network access are
required to launch an attack rather than sophisticated weapons systems;
<li>they are low risk to the perpetrator, who can hide his tracks and/or
deny illicit activity; 
<li>a small investment can result in a high payoff
in damaging an opponent's systems and provides a significant force
multiplier; 
<li>only minimal technological sophistication is needed to
engage in information warfare; 
<li>attacks can be orchestrated from
anywhere at any time; and 
<li> information warfare techniques are readily
available for those with Internet access.
</ul>
<p>
How does the military go after a thirteen-year-old system penetrator,
and what is the legal framework in which prosecutions can be
successfully mounted?  Legal issues pertaining to information warfare
were discussed in a talk by Col. Robert Giovagnoni of the Air Force
Office of Special Investigations.  His challenge is to catch the
intruder red-handed with his/her tools.  Unfortunately, it is sometimes
difficult to tell the normal users from the hackers until an attack is
well underway and even when an attacker is identified, current legal
mechanisms do not provide law enforcement with clear direction.  Active
defenses and hot pursuit of attackers are not usually options.  For
example, an attacker may be using someone else's computer as their
launch point and cyberspace soldiers cannot just move in and take out
an ``innocent'' system. Neither do the traditional concepts of search
and seizure scale well to cyberspace.  Finally, Col. Giovagnoni touched
on the problem of civil and criminal liability for system
administrators and investigators.  Often users have an expectation of
privacy and, even with the use of banner pages announcing that systems
are routinely monitored, only nebulous legal protections are available
for system defenders.
<p>
After a thorough discussion of the nature of the defensive information
warfare problem, a series of presentations described ongoing efforts to
address current system vulnerabilities.
<p>
The need for continued research and development in encryption,
intrusion detection, and countermeasures was the focus of session on
the second day.  Robin Roberts of the CIA made a particularly
interesting report (though I was unable to attend it) on the agency's
Workstation and Network Encryption Program.  Intended to provide NSA
Type-1 encryption for permanent storage and network transport in PC and
LAN environments, a crypto peripheral has been developed which can be
used on servers, workstations and laptops. This ongoing project gives
the community a new tool with which to insert cryptographic protection
with minimal disruption to ongoing operations.
<p>
The state of system accreditation was presented by Jack Eller, of
CISS.  Problems facing accreditations today include: overlapping
accreditation responsibilities, inconsistent and incomplete policies,
the high cost of accreditation, and a shift in paradigms from one in
which the data owner controlled the infrastructure to one of networked
systems in which the data owner no longer controls the infrastructure.
The DoD Information Technology Security Certification and Accreditation
Process (DITSCAP) is intended to provide a degree of standardization in
the certification process while promoting methods  that will reuse
existing documentation and analysis and that can be applied at any
stage in a system's lifecycle.
<p>
LTC Bernard Krauss presented a discussion of how DISA/CISS uses Red
Teams to assess the vulnerabilities of computer systems.  These
assessments involve examination of the usual holes found in network
operating systems. A point made during this presentation and throughout
the symposium was that once an attacker has entered one system, the
trust relationships between multiple systems within a network permit
access to most, if not all, of the remaining systems.  It is worth
noting that this is the same problem encountered when one depends upon
firewalls: if the interlopers can break through the firewall (or better
yet find a back door into your system) they are usually free to romp
around at will.  Krauss emphasized that although external penetration
is a threat, today the vast majority of problems are caused by
insiders.  Of particular interest were his slides describing the use of
social engineering techniques to convince an insider to divulge
sensitive information -- call up and say that General X needs the
information immediately, then fool a legitimate user into reading or
FAXing the data in the clear.  A presentation on the INFOSEC training
and awareness programs being conducted by DISA/CISS under the
supervision of George Bieber provided the audience with references to
resources to help insure that inside personnel understand the
importance of simple security measures and precautions.
<p>
Larry Merritt, the technical director of AFWIC, told the audience that
today the United States would be unable to survive a structured IW
attack.  During the symposium, several areas of research and
development were identified. Tools to warn administrators of ongoing
attacks are needed.  These include automated intrusion detection
systems, incident response techniques, network mapping tools to
describe who is hooked up to who, near-real-time risk management tools,
and techniques for rapid deployment of counter measures.  The need for
continuous vulnerability analysis to assess system risks was identified
along with active techniques for the detection and elimination of
malicious code.  Tools are needed to  manage interconnections to global
networks.  Finally enhanced training and awareness are needed to avoid
trivial vulnerabilities.
<p>
Although the symposium focused on DoD, the problem of information
warfare is not restricted to the defense community.  DoD is becoming
increasingly dependent upon the civilian information infrastructure,
which is essentially world-wide.  Commercial systems are no less
vulnerable than their military counterparts.  Perhaps this year's
version of the techno-flick will be more sinister as malicious entities
attack not only command and control systems, but the power grid and
telephone systems as well.

<H3>Hacker Challenges -- Boon or Bane?</H3>
<STRONG><BR>
</STRONG>
<p>
In the past year, several businesses have made resources publicly
available on the Internet and challenged all comers to find bugs in
them or break into them.  Incentives offered to those who reported
valid break-ins or bugs have ranged from T-shirts to cold cash.  Recently, 
Gene Spafford of Purdue University decried this growing practice in
a message circulated widely on the Internet.  <i>Cipher</i> has
obtained responses from some of the organizations who have sponsored
challenges of one sort or another, and circulating them along with that
note.  We thank Prof. Spafford and the organizations who responded to
our request for comments.
<H3>A Few Comments on "Hacker Challenges"</H3>
	by Eugene H. Spafford<br>
	   COAST Laboratory Director<br>
	   Purdue University<br>
	   http://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/spaf<br>
<p>
I note with dismay the increasing number of "hacker challenges" used
in marketing security products.  I think these are actually harmful to
the profession and practice of security, rather than helpful. I
believe the harm comes in two ways: (1) the challenges don't serve as
any real test of the products, and it denigrates security
professionals by suggesting that they should accept them as proof of
security; and (2) it helps reinforce the image that there should be
some form of reward for hacking through security measures.  Neither of
these are views we should responsibly seek to promote.
<p>
Consider the nature of showing the security of a product.  Does a
"challenge" meet the goal of testing, which is to increase one's
confidence in the correct functioning of the artifact?  It really
doesn't, for a number of reasons:
<ul>
<li> Few such "challenges" are conducted using established testing
        techniques.  They are ad hoc, random tests.  Thus, there is 
	no way of determining final coverage.  For instance, if 90% of
        all challenge attacks are of the same variety, what has the
        "test" really shown?  (Consider testing a calculator.  If you
        perform 10,000 tests, but 9000 of them are addition with
	zero, have you done a thorough job of testing?)
<li> That no problems are found does not mean that no problems exist.
        It may mean that the testers didn't expose them.  Doing
	random, black-box testing remotely is not likely to really
	test much of the product.
	(Challenge testing is basically a form of black-box testing.)
<li> That no problems are reported does not mean that no problems
        exist.  The "testers" might not have recognized them.  (Look
        at how often software is released with bugs, even after
        careful scrutiny -- users don't always recognize anomalies.)
<li> That no problems are reported does not mean that no problems
        exist.  How do you know that the "testers" will report what
        they find?  How do you know the vendor is getting accurate
        data?  If Jane Random Hacker found a way to penetrate the
	product in a manner that vendor monitoring didn't expose, it
	is possible she'd find more profitable uses (later) for that
	information than informing the vendor about it.  Further,
	because of possible problems with the law, hackers might not
	want to report success and draw attention to themselves.
<li> Simply because the vendor does not report a successful penetration
        does not mean that one did not occur -- the vendor may
        choose not to report it because it would reflect poorly
        on its product, or not meet the narrow criteria for a
        "successful" penetration, or the vendor may not be able to
	detect it happened. (How can anyone outside prove otherwise?)
<li> Seldom do the really good experts, on either side of the fence,
        participate in such exercises.  Thus, anything done is usually
        done by amateurs. (The "honor" of having won the challenge is
        not sufficient to lure the good ones into the fray.  Good consultants
        command fees of several thousand $$ per day in some cases --
	why should they donate their time and names for what amounts
	to free consulting and advertising?)
</ul>
<p>       
Also note that any such challenge also serves to aid potential
hackers in their later pursuits:
<ul>
<li> It gives potential miscreants some period to practice breaking
        the system without penalty.  Any other time spent hacking at
	one of these might result in legal action or worse.  Isn't it
	nice the vendor is giving free practice time to the bad guys?  I
	hope all the potential customers are equally pleased at this.
<li> It gives miscreants an excuse if they are caught trying to break
        into the system later (e.g., "We thought the contest was
        still on.")  This might well weaken any legal action taken
	later. 
<li> The vendor contest may actually even include some publication of
        hacks that don't work -- thus helping reduce the effort to
        compromise the system later.
</ul>
<p>
Furthermore, the whole process sends the wrong message -- that we
should build things and then try to break them, or that there is some
prestige or glory in breaking systems.  That isn't what we need.
Instead, we want to promote responsible behavior, using established
methods.  We need to establish that security is something best done by
well-trained professionals, and that hacking into systems is not "job
training".  (I've argued this point in more detail in "Are Computer
Break-Ins Ethical?", Journal of Systems and Software, Jan 1992,
17(1).)
<p>
Good security should be carefully designed in and tested using
established methods.  Tiger teams have a role, but using them
(especially ad hoc teams) as a major means of establishing safety is
negligent.  Security "contests" to demonstrate a system are worse, and
should be viewed negatively by potential customers.  It should be
generally recognized that such contests cannot establish more than
cursory confidence in a product, are not a good means of testing, and
actually create a climate that may encourage or enable people to try
to break the product after it is in use.
<p>
If I was a potential customer of any security product, which of the
following, somewhat exaggerated approaches would be more likely to
convince me that a company had its act together?  Which one is the
company more likely to be seeking to sell based on smoke and mirrors?
<ul>
<li>Approach A: Our product was coded by a bunch of really talented
    hackers and former system crackers who learned everything they
    know on the IRC.  We put our product up on the Internet for 6
    months, and offered a nifty backpack and some money to anyone who
    could break in.  No one claimed the prize.  Obviously, ours is a
    superior product.

<li>Approach B: Our company is certified as an ISO 9000 company.  We
    used formal software engineering approaches to design and build
    our product, ending in full functional testing, D-U path testing,
    and statement coverage to 98%.  We also hired well-known
    independent security experts A, B, and C under non-disclosure to
    examine the code and identify weaknesses, and then conduct field
    trials.  Company X and University Y have also had the opportunity
    to examine and test our product, and none of them have found
    flaws.
</ul>
<p>
Approach "B" is clearly the one we want to encourage.  Approach "A"
encourages cycles of "penetrate and patch" and that is what is wrong
with most mass-market software available today.  However, vendors
claim that Approach "A" is what sells more product than Approach "B,"
in part because it seems to inspire more confidence, and in part
because it is cheaper to produce software if they don't use an
approach like "B".
<p>
If we, as a community and a profession, want better quality and more
trustworthy products, we must begin to demonstrate it.  The best way
is in the marketplace, by showing a willingness to buy based on
substance, and not flash.  Saying "no" to attempts to sell us products
based on "hacker challenges" is one way to do that.

<p>
Most of Gene's points are very valid, and I agree with
them. His points are aimed at challenges promoted by a company in
order to show that a product is secure. On the other hand, the
Community ConneXion challenges are promoted in order to show that a
product is *insecure*.
<p>
It's easy to prove insecurity, but hard to prove security. The
vendor-supported challenges are trying to prove security, which is
rather misguided. In proving insecurity though, our challenges are
rather simple, as they only require one counter-example to be proven
that a system is insecure.

<p>
We received a very similar letter from Mr. Spafford when we first began our
contest and posted an extensive reply on our site while it was in
operation. I will summarize the main points for Cipher readers:
<p>
1) Mr. Spafford says that these challenges are a poor way of testing software.
<br>
That is true, however it was never our purpose to test the software by
running a challenge. The testing has been completed or we would not have
been confident enough to place $10,000 on the line. The main purpose of our
security challenge was to promote awareness of the existence of security
options for Macintosh servers. It was never intended as proof of the
security of the system or to replace rigorous testing.
<p>
2) Mr. Spafford says that these contests promote hacking.
<br>
We disagree with that entirely. By his argument, the Daytona 500 is
responsible for people driving too fast on highways. I think there are
people who drive as if they are on a race track (one passed me this morning
on my way to work) but it is clear that rules on the highway are different
from rules on the race track and no court in the land would let a person
get away with arguing differently. We clearly stated on our site the
limitations of the contest including a warning that we were not condoning
similar attacks on systems other than the one provided for the contest.
<p>
3) Mr. Spafford says that these contests make it easier to break other systems.
<br>
Mr. Spafford is looking in the wrong place. Bulletin boards, newsletters,
Web sites and more all exist with information on how to hack into systems.
Books have been written on the subject, movies made, and special
investigative reports offered on television all on the subject. Writing
about what failed on our site will not help hackers significantly. Our site
also did not provide free practice to hackers because *none of the attempts
worked*. Practice is useless if you do not at some point succeed.
<p>
4) Mr. Spafford says that it is wrong to test things by trying to break them.
<br>
I don't think he thought about what he was saying there. What is beta
testing but an attempt to find where software will break? Stress testing
for metal structures? Crash testing cars? It is a fact of life that part of
testing a product is to find where it will fail, which means trying
actively to break the product in a variety of ways.
<p>
In summary, it is our opinion that Mr. Spafford's letter has no bearing on
the challenge that we had online. He probably would have been better served
by investigating our site more thoroughly before writing the letter.

<p>
My quick reaction is that the Netscape Bugs Bounty is not
a "hacker challenge".  It is a way to reward users for
helping to find bugs that get past us.  I don't think that
we make any claims such as "our product must be secure
because no one claimed our hacker prize".  We also don't
view the bug bounty as a replacement for our own QA
efforts, but a supplement to it.

<TITLE>Summary of 34th IETF meeting, Dallas, December 4-8 1995</TITLE>
<H3>Summary of 34th IETF Meeting, held 4-8 December 1995, Dallas</H3>
by Hilarie Orman
<p>
Progress in defining and implementing a proposed network layer
security standard and associated key exchange methods enlivened the
IPSEC working group meeetings at the 34th IETF held in Dallas December
4th through 8th.  The working group, which has been meeting at IETF's
for the last 4 years, has defined a set of enhancements for IP packets
for authentication and integrity, and orthogonally, privacy.  Several
implementors were on-hand with laptop machines, and they exchanged
ICMP ("ping") packets using the Authentication Header (AH) enhancements
which protect an entire IP message, and the encryption enhancements
(ESP), which make the IP payload opaque.
<p>
The required algorithms for use with these options are MD5 for AH and
DES for ESP, and these were the ones used in the demonstrations.
The RFC's that define the architecture, the AH and ESP headers, and
the environment for applying the algorithms are RFC's 1825, 1826,
1827, 1828, and 1829, available from the ftp directory
ftp://ds.internic.net/documents/rfc.
<p>
Two key exchange protocols using the Diffie-Hellman algorithm were
demonstrated: Photuris and SKIP.  In each case, two independent
implementations achieved interoperation.  Photuris and SKIP differ
primarily in regard to supplying Perfect Forward Secrecy; Photuris can
supply a session key that is independent of any long-term state, while
SKIP keys are interdependent for the life of an advertised public
component.  As a corollary, Photuris requires maintenance of some
state information while the key is computed, and SKIP is stateless.
The draft documents describing these protocols are available from
<a href="ftp://ds.internic.net/documents/internet-drafts">.
ftp://ds.internic.net/documents/internet-drafts</a>.
<p>
Progress on a third key exchange protocol, ISAKMP, was discussed in
the working group, and two implementations were demonstrated
immediately following the working group meeting.  ISAKMP is designed
to serve as an "umbrella" for many, perhaps thousands, of key exchange
methods.  Photuris has been influenced by ISAKMP, and the
Diffie-Hellman algorithm is only one of a class of methods that can be
supported by either protocol.
<p>
Other working groups in the security area that met were the Public Key
Infrastructure (X.509) Group, Common Authentication Technology, Domain
Name System (DNS) Security, One Time Password Authentication (OTP),
and the HTTP Transaction Security group.
<p>
The DNS extensions are relevant to the IP security work because they
provide a possible method for distributing public keys for use in
authenticating the key components that are essential to the
Diffie-Hellman exchanges.  The DNS security extensions are described
in
<a href="
ftp://ds.internic.net/documents/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-dnssec-secext-06.txt">
ftp://ds.internic.net/documents/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-dnssec-secext-06.txt
</a>.
<p>
The OTP working group has move its specification forward towards
publication as a Proposed Standard RFC.  It is expected to become a
Proposed Standard in early January 1996.  A freely distributable
implementation of this specification is available by anonymous FTP from:
ftp.nrl.navy.mil/pub/security/nrl-opie
<p>
Minutes for the meetings will be available at
<a href="ftp://ds.internic.net/documents/minutes">
ftp://ds.internic.net/documents/minutes</a> directory.
<p>
In a surprising development, the SNMPv2 group determined that they
could reach no consensus on security extensions to the Simple Network
Monitoring Protocol, and so they will remove those extensions from
the current draft.

<TITLE>9th IFIP WG 11.3 Working Conference on Database Security
</TITLE>
<H2>Report on the 9th IFIP WG 11.3 Working Conference on Database Security
by David Spooner</H2><br>
<p>
The Ninth Annual IFIP WG 11.3 Working Conference on Database Security
was held on August 13-16, 1995, in Rensselaerville, New York.  The
conference was organized into ten session, of which eight were paper
sessions and two were panel discussions.
<p>
The opening session was highlighted with a presentation by T. C. Ting
(University of Connecticut and the National Science Foundation) titled
"How Secure is Secure?".  In this presentation, he stressed that policy
makers must take into consideration the value of data resources, the
consequences of unauthorized access, and the tolerance and risk in
securing data.  He also stressed that management must be convinced to
take responsibility for policy making.  This session also included a
presentation of a paper by J.  Dobson (University of Newcastle) and M.
J. Martin (University of Newcastle), titled "Messages, Communications,
Information Security:  Protecting the User from the Data." It was
presented by Dobson who argued that there can never be fully secure
systems and that it is important to analyze the failure modes of
systems.  He suggested an approach based on common abstractions (e.g.,
messages, communication) that can be instantiated to model and analyze
a given system.
<p>
The second session was devoted to federated and replicated databases,
and was chaired by E. Fernandez (Florida Atlantic University).  The
first paper presented was by  M. S. Olivier (Rand Afrikaans University)
titled "Self- Protecting Objects in a Secure Federated Database."  He
described the design of a secure object-oriented federated system in
which the objects are self protecting via the use of a trusted
extension within each object.  A trusted common core provides a secure
communication channel for the federated system, and a local trusted
extension provides local support for objects at the nodes of the
federated system.  This was followed by a presentation by D. Jonscher
(University of Zurich) of a paper by him and K.  Dittrich (University
of Zurich), titled "Argos - A Configurable Access Control System for
Interoperable Environments." He described a federated system with a
global access control model and local autonomous access control
models.  Propagation of authorizations from the global to the local
models is required to maintain consistency between the global and local
access control models.  The details of a prototype implementation were
discussed.  The final paper in this session was titled  "The Modulated-
Input Modulated-Output Model,"  by  I. S. Moskowitz (Naval Research
Laboratory) and M. H. Kang (Naval Research Laboratory), and was
presented by Moskowitz.  Moskowitz discussed the problem of getting
update messages to upper levels with acknowledgment in a replicated
multilevel secure database.  He described a "pump" mechanism to do this
that is under development at the Naval Research Laboratory and an
analysis of required buffer sizes for the pump so that no messages are
lost.
<p>
The third session addressed secure object-oriented database systems and
was chaired by P. Samarati (University of Milan).  The first paper in
this session, titled "User-Role Based Security Enforcement Mechanisms
for Object-Oriented Systems and Applications," by  S. A. Demurjian
(University of Connecticut), M.-Y. Hu (IBM Corporation), T. A. Daggett
(University of Connecticut), and T. C. Ting (University of
Connecticut), was presented by Hu.  The presentation described the
continuation of the development of the ADAM system, which is an
object-oriented design and code generation system using C++.  The
system uses a separate class hierarchy to model the roles required in
an application system.  The second paper in this session was titled "A
Formal Specification of an Authorization Model for Object- Oriented
Databases," by E. B. Fernandez (Florida Atlantic University), R.  B.
France (Florida Atlantic University) and D. Wei (Florida Atlantic
University), and was presented by Fernandez.  The presentation showed
how the Z  formal specification language can be used to formalize
security policies.  Fernandez argued that this would be useful to do
for assurance purposes.  One of the lessons learned was the difficulty
of modeling the structure of a database with the Z language.  The final
paper in the session was "Multilevel Data Model for the Trusted ONTOS
Prototype," by M.  Schaefer (ARCA Systems, Inc.), P. Marte (ONTOS
Inc.), T. Kanawati (ONTOS, Inc.), and V. Lyons (ONTOS, Inc.), and was
presented by Kanawati.  The presentation described a secure
object-oriented database system under development at ONTOS, Inc. that
attempts to balance confidentiality with integrity.  It supports MAC
without compartments, cover stories, and classifies methods as well as
attributes.
<p>
The fourth session was on mandatory access controls and was chaired by
M.  Schaefer (ARCA Systems, Inc.).  The first paper in the session was
titled "Modeling Mandatory Access Control in Role-Based Security
Systems," by M.  Nyanchama (University of Natal-Durban) and S. L.
Osborn (University of Western Ontario), and was presented by
Nyanchama.  Their approach studies information flows and uses
constraints on these information flows to model the requirements for
MAC.  The second paper in the session was "Modeling a Multilevel
Database with Temporal Downgrading Functionalities," by F.  Cuppens
(ONERA-CERT) and A. Gabillon (ONERA-CERT).  It was presented by
Cuppens.  The paper addresses downgrading based on events, times, and
delays.  Since the last two types of downgrading require a temporal
model, the paper proposes a temporal language for specifying
downgrading rules.  The final paper in the session was titled "Towards
a MAC Policy Framework," by X. Qian (SRI International) and T. F. Lunt
(ARPA/CSTO), and was presented by Qian.  This paper looks at the
problem of multilevel secure federated databases and whether semantic
interoperation makes sense.  It looks at such things as the semantics
of object labels, upward information flows, and inference channels.  It
proposes as new components in a system, an interpretation policy, a
view policy, and an update policy.
<p>
The next session focused on concurrency control issues and was chaired
by T. Keefe (Pennsylvania State University).  The first paper, titled
"A Locking Protocol for Multilevel Secure Databases Providing Support
for Long Transactions," was written and presented by S. Pal
(Pennsylvania State University).  Pal discussed a concurrency control
approach for secure multilevel databases that is based on object
versions and uses an untrusted scheduler at each level.  The second
paper, titled "An Adaptive Policy for Improved Timeliness in Secure
Database Systems," by S. H. Son (University of Virginia), R. David
(University of Virginia) and B. Thuraisingham (MITRE Corporation), was
presented by Son.  This paper explores secure two-phase locking schemes
for real-time databases.  Compromises are required between real-time
requirements and security requirements, and the paper presents
simulation results to compare several such compromises.  The next
paper, also presented by Son, was titled "A Secure Concurrency Control
Protocol for Real-Time Databases," by R. Mukkamala (Old Dominion
University) and S.  H. Son (University of Virginia).  This paper
discusses a multiversion concurrency control method in which higher
priority transactions can abort other transactions at the same level.
The transaction scheduler and the lock manager must be trusted.  The
final paper in the session was titled "Providing Different Degrees of
Recency Options to Transactions in Multilevel Secure Databases," by V.
Atluri (Rutgers University), E. Bertino (University of Milan), and S.
Jajodia (George Mason University), and was presented by Atluri.  The
idea presented in this paper is that a transaction should be able to
specify a desired level of recency in the data it reads.  The paper
presents a protocol based on multiple versions and time stamps.
<p>
Design and implementation of access controls was the topic for the next
session, chaired by X. Qian (SRI International).  The first paper in
this session was titled "Assured Discretionary Access Control for
Trusted RDBMS," by M. Schaefer (ARCA Systems, Inc.) and G. Smith (ARCA
Systems, Inc.), and was presented by Schaefer.  The goal of the work is
to investigate whether it is possible to implement DAC for a view-based
secure relational database system with assurance above the B1 level.
Schaefer proposed several potential approaches and concluded that a
credible paradigm is to use primitive views (i.e., no joins).  The
second paper in the session was titled "A Formal Security Design
Approach for Information Exchange in Organizations," by  R. Holbein
(University of Zurich), S. Teufel (University of Zurich), and K.
Bauknecht (University of Zurich), and was presented by Holbein.
Holbein argued that for need-to-know security design in organizations
it is important to be able to trace a particular access right back to
the need-to-know policy in an organization.  He proposed a formal
specification approach based on business process models to do this.
<p>
The next session was a panel discussion on role-based access control
and next generation security models, chaired by R. Thomas (Odyssey
Research Associates).  The first panelist was H. H. Bruggemann
(University of Essen) who discussed techniques for using object
technology to reduce the complexity of access rights administration.
The next panelist was D.  Ferraiolo (Department of Commerce, NIST) who
discussed how roles provide an ability to articulate and enforce
enterprise-specific protection policies.  B. Hartman (Odyssey Research
Associates) was the next panelist to speak.  He began by stating that
security is critical for distributed object systems, but that no one
solution is appropriate for all markets.  He described an effort to
develop a role-based security model for the Object Management Group
(OMG) common architecture.  P. Samarati (University of Milan) spoke as
the next panelist and  discussed how next generation authorization
models must increase expressiveness and flexibility.  Then R. Sandhu
(George Mason University) argued that a problem with existing security
models is that they do not adequately distinguish between users and
subjects.  He also suggested that role constraints will be important in
the development of future systems.  M. Schaefer (ARCA, Systems, Inc.)
spoke next and suggested that one role does not fit all users who have
that role, and a way is needed to selectively add and delete access
rights given the context of a situation.  He also warned that greater
functionality probably implies greater side-effects.  The final
panelist was T. C. Ting (University of Connecticut) who suggested that
no single security model works for everything, that MAC and DAC are
both important, and that role- based access control is one solution for
DAC.  After the panelists spoke there was an extended discussion on
whether the trend towards roles is appropriate.  It was suggested that
roles are close to what many users want, but are not a universal
solution.  It also became clear that there is not general agreement on
the definition of role-based security.
<p>
The next session focused on inference controls and was chaired by Don
Marks (Department of Defense).  The first paper in this session was
titled "Inference Analysis During Multilevel Database Design," by R. K.
Burns (AGCS Inc.).  Burns discussed a toolset for multilevel database
design.  The tool set uses Entity-Relationship diagrams augmented with
a security lattice and a database inference tool to improve the design
of a secure database schema. The second paper in the session was titled
"A Tool for Inference Detection and Knowledge Discovery in Databases,"
by S. Rath (University of Tulsa), D. Jones (University of Tulsa), J.
Hale (University of Tulsa) and S. Shenoi (University of Tulsa), and was
presented by Shenoi.  Shenoi described an imprecise inference model for
a mixed database of precise relations, imprecise relations, and fuzzy
relations.  The approach uses sieves for filtering data chucks into
equivalence classes based on the context.  These equivalence classes
are used to model functional dependencies and make inferences.  The
last paper in the session was presented by T. Hinke, and was titled
"ILIAD: An Integrated Laboratory for Inference Analysis and Detection,"
by T. H. Hinke (University of Alabama in Huntsville), H. S. Delugach
(University of Alabama in Huntsville) and R. P.  Wolf (University of
Alabama in Huntsville).  Hinke described a software system composed of
a database generator, a single-facet inference tool, and a multi-facet
inference tool.  He described how simulation can be used to generate
data with a coherent cover story that can be used as a test database
for the system.  The inference tools in the system focus on transitive
association type instances and are based on a semantic graph.
<p>
The next session was a panel session chaired by M. Schaefer (ARCA
Systems, Inc.). The first panelist to speak was R. Henning (Harris
Corporation) who discussed what system administrators want in a secure
database product.  She listed such things as single seat
administration, accountability, confidentiality, integrity, and minimal
duplication of services.  She also warned that what works for one
application may not necessarily work for all.  The next speaker was R.
Miller (IBM) who described the requirements for large (terabyte) secure
databases.  He stated that these databases are usually, multi-vendor,
geographically distributed, and heterogeneous.  Security goals for such
systems are consistency across the systems, with single sign-ons and
flexible audit functionality.  The next panelist was T.  Parenty
(Sybase, Inc.) who suggested that it is necessary to think about
security in a context larger than a single application or database and
that user authentication is particularly important.  He also felt that
multilevel security is far down the road for what most business
applications need now.  The final panelist was J. Worthington
(Informix, Inc.) who described a level B3 multilevel database product,
but warned that sales may not be sufficient to continue the product.
He also discussed what users want, including strong authentication,
different privileges at different times and locations, and flexible
encryption.  In summary, he indicated that the requirements are not
strictly role-based or task-based, and that there is a temporal
component.  The presentations were followed by a general discussion
that focused on three major issues: (1) privacy concerns, (2)
increasing communications between vendors and researchers in the
security area, and (3) customer requirements.
<p>
The final session focused on the topic of storage jamming and a
discussion of what was learned at the conference.  This session was
chaired by T. C.  Ting (University of Connecticut).  The session began
with a presentation by J. McDermott (Naval Research Laboratory) of a
paper titled "Storage Jamming," by J. McDermott (Naval Research
Laboratory) and D. Goldschlag (Naval Research Laboratory). McDermott
defined storage jamming as an attack on an organization by putting
bogus values that satisfy integrity constraints into a database.  He
then discussed techniques for reducing susceptibility to such attacks
within an organization (e.g., well designed and structured systems and
data).  This was followed by a summary and discussion of the conference
led by J. Dobson (University of Newcastle).  Some of the issues
identified included: (1) technology is moving from research to
engineering, (2) advanced information processing techniques are coming
into use, (3) some problems are still open, but may not yet be relevant
to customers (e.g., inference detection, connectionless
communications), (4) new security models are required, but the
conceptual basis for them is still a matter of debate, and (5) the
problems and concerns of indirect stakeholders are not always being
addressed.
<p>
An informal evening session organized by T. Y. Lin (San Jose State
University) was also held during the conference and was focused on data
mining and its relationship to database security.  There was
significant interest in this topic and the discussion will be continued
at future conferences.
<p>
The next IFIP WG 11.3 Working Conference on Database Security will be held, 
July 22-24, 1996 in Como, Italy.  The call for papers and details of the 
conference can be obtained on the World Wide Web at URL,

<TITLE>Notes on the 18th National Information System Security Conference
</TITLE>
<H2>18th NISS Conference draws throng to Baltimore</H2>
<p>
The National Information Systems Security Conference (formerly the
National Computer Security Conference) convened at the Baltimore 
Convention Center on a succession of lovely days from October 10-13.
Although the halls seemed a bit less crowded than past years, organizers
reported that the registration was over 1900, on a par with past events.
Several innovations (in addition to the new name) marked this year's
edition.  Many vendors took advantage of the opportunity to provide 
exhibits on the floor of the Convention Center, so it was possible to 
get an overview of current technology without traipsing to half a dozen 
suites in two or three different hotels.  The Conference Proceedings 
includes the Tables of Contents from all of the seventeen previous 
editions of the conference, which increases its value as a reference, 
and a subset of the proceedings was provided on CD-ROM at no charge.  
The disc includes those papers and panel statements whose authors choose 
to submit electronic copy) as well quite a bit of other information 
(I think -- the disc is unfortunately formatted for DOS and Windows, but
not for Macintoshes, so your reporter can only make educated guesses
about the full contents.
<p>
     Another traditional feature of this conference is a large
number of auxiliary meetings that are scheduled on an ad hoc basis during
the conference.  The large number of these meetings this year, together
with the press of other work, conspired to prevent your reporter from
attending more than a couple of regular paper and panel sessions -- 
hence the absence of descriptions of paper and panel sessions from this
article.  Any Cipher readers who attended and would like to contribute
summaries of sessions they found interesting are invited to mail them
to the editor for inclusion in the next issue.
<p>
     Awards were given to two regular papers: "Internet sniffer attacks,"
by Eugene Schultz and Thomas Longstaff, and "Maintaining privacy in
electronic transactions," by Benjamin Cox.  "Authorship analysis:
identifying the author of a program," by Ivan Krsul and Gene Spafford
won the student paper award.  In her opening keynote address, Marjory 
Blumenthal, Director of the Computer Science and Telecommunications 
Board of the National Research Council discussed the National 
Information Infrastructure (NII) and its security requirements, 
concluding that the government needs to foster the development of a 
security architecture for the NII.  Laryngitis prevented Dennis Branstad
from delivering the address he had written as recipient of the National
Computer Security Award;  Steve Walker read the address for him.Stephen
Barnett of the National Computer Security and Irene Gilbert of NIST 
co-chaired the conference, and Jack Holleran and Dennis Gilbert organized
the program.  Papers (up to 8 pages) for next year's conference (October 
22-25, 1996 at the Baltimore Convention Center) are due February 16, 
1996; for information, send e-mail to NISSCONFERENCE@Dockmaster.ncsc.mil.
<p>
    A limited number of single copies of the proceedings (hard copy)
and CD-ROM (this is a subset of the papers) are available from the
National Computer Security Center.  Cipher readers should call 
+1(410)766-8729 or send e-mail to NISSConference@dockmaster.ncsc.mil 
with requests (see proceedings table of contents in this issue).

<TITLE>Crypto '95 Invited Talks by Morris and Shamir</TITLE>
<H2>Notes on Crypto '95 invited talks by R. Morris and A. Shamir</H2>
by Jim Gillogly and Paul Syverson
<HR>
<p>
Crypto '95 attendance continued its upward trend this year, with over
300 participants.  Proceedings are available from Springer-Verlag (see
the IACR home page 
<a href="http://www.swcp.com/~iacr/">(http://www.swcp.com/~iacr/)</a> 
or via the Interesting
Links section on Cipher's Web page) that cover the regular sessions,
but we include notes on invited talks by Robert Morris, reported by
Jim Gillogly, and Adi Shamir, reported by Paul Syverson. Bob Morris
has reviewed Jim's summary, but, as Paul notes, Adi Shamir, has NOT

<H3>
Notes on "Non-cryptographic Ways of Losing Information" a talk by
Robert Morris</H3> reported by Jim Gillogly
<p>
Bob Morris (recently retired from NSA) gave a fascinating invited
lecture entitled "Non-cryptographic Ways of Losing Information".  I
hope he writes it up; until then, here are my notes from his
presentation.
<p>
Two things he said which I found new and fascinating:
<ul>
<li> During the early 1950's many major powers were discouraged by the
  tendency of then-modern crypto machines to fail in a way that would
  send plaintext instead of ciphertext, and they went to one time pads
  for most of their high-level enciphered traffic.  Because of key
  re-use, we were regularly and routinely reading pieces of that
  traffic.  This included many systems from various countries.  (I
  wonder if he meant to include VENONA among these systems?) Sometimes
  the people who prepared OTP's would double their profit by selling
  them to more than one customer.

<li> By the middle to late 1960's cryptanalysis became less cost effective
  than obtaining the information by other means -- wiretaps and so on.
</ul>
<p>
Morris emphasized and said we should write down these dicta:
<ul>
<li>Never underestimate the attention, risk, money and time that an opponent
   will put into reading traffic.

<li>Rule 1 of cryptanalysis: check for plaintext.
</ul>
<p>
The real start of modern cryptology should be dated to the Enigma
machines, which typified the new character of the art.  Much has been
made of the errors of the German cipher clerks, but egregious as they
were, the errors made by the British cryptographers were vastly worse,
and the American blunders were worse yet.  German analysts regularly
read and used Atlantic convoy orders throughout the war -- they were
transmitted in an old code.
<p>
One must always assume that the enemy has a copy of the
machine/algorithm.  A system that relies on keeping the algorithm
secret is eventually doomed to failure, because it will always be
discovered by some means or other.
<p>
He sees microphones and antennas everywhere: the telephone line cord is
an antenna; if telephone linemen were working on a pole outside his
house he'd call the police an then find out what they were working on.
In an unspecified country he called Lower Slobbovia (Al Capp, isn't
it?) American troops used encrypted radiophones; when they broke they
were taken to local repair shops to be fixed.  When they got home the
US engineers were interested to see the modifications that had been
made.  He mentioned a few similar instances, including the lovely
carved wooden seal given to the US Embassy in Moscow to decorate the
Ambassador's residence.  [A replica is now on view at the National
Cryptologic Museum with the transmitter cavity visible.] Cordless
phones have a range of 5 miles or so.  Use of cellular phones is
increasing dramatically, as well as fax and modems.
<p>
He discussed the Walker/Whitworth spying case, and said one of his
design criteria is to design systems with Walker in them: it's not good
enough to have a system where everyone must be trusted, but it must
also be made robust against insiders.  This may include going to
non-paper systems, so that there are no paper keys that the Walkers of
the world can shop to the other side.
<p>
Threats and risks include: overconfidence, carelessness, eavesdropping
and tapping, theft of floppies and other materials, purchase, theft of
key material, burglary and blackmail.  Much or most loss is due to
insiders.
<p>
In the future there will be more radio used for ordinary
communications.  Americans are unwilling to pay for secure telephones,
but that's not the case in Europe.

Notes on "Cryptography -- Myths and Realities", a talk by Adi Shamir</H3><br>
Reported by Paul Syverson
<br>
<i>[Note: I produced this writeup from memory without the beneifit of notes,
and Shamir has not had the opportunity to review it. So, caveat lector!
							-Paul Syverson]</i>
<p>
The IACR Distinguished Lecture, ``Cryptography---Myths and Realities''
was given by Adi Shamir. The lecture was both entertaining and
informative, tracing the early history of events surrounding the
development of the RSA algorithm and giving practical advice for
computer security today.
<p>
One of the first myths dispelled was that one has to be a longstanding
expert on algorithms to come up with a good one.  Shamir's first
contact with Ron Rivest was in a letter suggesting they discuss the
advanced algorithms course that the two would teach together when
Shamir was visiting at MIT. Actually this letter, sent just weeks
before the beginning of the spring term, was the first he knew of his
assignment. And, at that point he had no background in algorithms! He
also documented the laborious uphill struggle that the cryptographer
faces as the cryptanalyst relentlessly swoops down on his work;
apparently early proposals for what would become RSA were worked out on
ski trips in Vermont that winter and spring.  On the ride up someone
would propose a scheme which would then be broken during the next run
down the mountain.  The final version actually came to Ron Rivest on
another occasion as he lay delirious and sick on his couch at home.
Another myth he refuted was that NSA is some vicious three headed
monster. He agreed that it has three heads but said that, contrary to
popular belief, his dealings with NSA had always been quite reasonable
if sometimes a bit unclear.
<p>
After the history lesson, Shamir concluded his talk with lessons for
commercial security today, which he called the
<p>
<H3>10 Commandments of Commercial Security</H3><b>
 1. Don't aim for perfect security</b><br>
	So, be realistic, and do the best you can within your limits.
	Roughly, you should double security expenditure to halve risk.<br><b>
 2. Don't solve the wrong problem</b><br>
	For example, note that US banks lose 10 billion dollars a year
	in check fraud but only 5 million in online fraud.<br><b>
 3. Don't sell security bottom-up</b><br>
	(in terms of the personnel hierarchy).<br><b>
 4. Don't use cryptographic overkill</b><br>
	Even bad crypto is usually the strong part of the system.<br><b>
 5. Don't make it complicated</b><br>
	This yields more places to attack the system,
	and it encourages users to find ways to bypass security.<br><b>
 6. Don't make it expensive.</b><br><b>
 7. Don't use a single line of defense</b><br>
	Have several layers so security can be maintained
	without expensive replacement of the primary line.<br><b>
 8. Don't forget the ``mystery attack''</b><br>
	Be able to regenerate security even when you have no idea
	what's going wrong. For example, smart cards are attackable
	but are great for quick cheap recovery.<br><b>
 9. Don't trust systems.</b><br><b>
10. Don't trust people.</b>

<TITLE>Perspective on Recent Events in Data Encryption Policy</TITLE>
<H2>Perspective on Recent Events in Data Encryption Policy</H2>
<i>[The following column crossed my electronic desk and struck me as a
good summary of where the current discussions of public policy on
encryption have led.  Thanks to Peter Lewis for permitting us to include
it here.--CEL]</i>
<p>
On The Net Column<br>
Monday, Sept. 11, 1995<br>
Peter H. Lewis<br>
<p>
        In terms of its ability to raise the nation's blood pressure, the
debate over data encryption has not yet reached the same levels as gun
control.
<p>
        But last week the Clinton Administration appeared to set the stage
for an equally divisive national debate over the rights of businesses and
individuals to keep secrets when using telephones, computers and other
forms of electronic communications.
<p>
        In two days of public hearings last week in Gaithersburg, Md., home
of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the
Administration in effect unveiled its long-awaited proposals to relax
restrictions on the export of cryptographic software.
<p>
       In effect, the Administration drew a line in the virtual sands of
cyberspace, signaling that it is willing to permit Americans to put
stronger cryptographic locks on their electronic data only if a spare key
to those locks is made available on demand to law enforcement agencies.
<p>
        There looms the conflict. Although the current debate is about
export controls on an esoteric form of software that most Americans do not
use, the "export" issue is ultimately irrelevant in today's era of global
electronic voice and data networks, where passwords, not passports, are
checked at the gates. Simply placing a common privacy program on an
Internet-connected computer in Austin, Tex., is effectively no different
from sending a shrink-wrapped copy of the program to Moscow.
<p>
        The real issue is how much privacy the Government is willing to
allow its own citizens, and the latest word from the Clinton Administration
is that the right to electronic privacy, like the right to bear arms, is
not absolute.
<p>
        ***
<p>
        Cryptography is the science of secret writing. In this digital era,
secret writing applies not just to notes handed from one spy to another,
but also to telephone calls between individuals, funds transfers between
banks, bank and credit card records, electronic mail, faxes, and an endless
variety of computer files.
<p>
        The Clinton Administration has been clear and consistent in
outlining its basic position on cryptographic systems. The goal is to allow
American citizens and companies to use the strongest possible cryptographic
technology, while at the same time preserving the ability of law
enforcement agencies to perform court-authorized wiretaps as part of the
effort to catch drug dealers, terrorists, child pornographers and other
miscreants.
<p>
        In other words, it favors strong cryptography, but not too strong.
<p>
        One way to measure the strength of cryptographic software is the
length of the software key necessary to encode and decode a message. The
longer the key, in terms of digital bits, the harder it is for an
unauthorized user to decipher the message.
<p>
        In recent years, the Government has generally permitted Americans
to export cryptographic software with key lengths up to 40 bits. Experts
say that 40-bit keys are secure from casual snooping, but will fall quickly
to a determined codebreaker. The fact that the Government allows 40-bit
encryption systems to be exported is a pretty good indication that the
National Security Agency can break them easily.
<p>
        There are literally hundreds of stronger cryptography programs
readily available outside the United States, and these stronger programs
are attractive to businesses that want to safeguard their data from
Internet bandits and corporate and government spies.
<p>
        Last week, after more than a year of intense analysis of the
software export controls issue, the Government unveiled what it said was
the best possible compromise.
<p>
        Under the new policy, companies can export encryption algorithms
using 64-bit keys, which are much more secure, but only if spare keys are
made available to law enforcement agents under standard legal procedures.
Otherwise, the 40-bit limit continues to apply.
 <p>
       The "spare key" technology, officially known as key escrow, is
anathema to many privacy advocates who fear Government abuses. The
Government first proposed a key escrow system with its so-called Clipper
Chip, a technology that failed to win acceptance even as a voluntary
standard.
<p>
        Unlike Clipper, which was based on a classified algorithm called
Skipjack that only a few people outside the Government were allowed to
examine, the new policy allows people to use any algorithm they choose --
as long as it uses a key no larger than 64 bits, and as long as the keys
are entrusted to a domestic third party accessible to the Government, and
as long as the key escrow mechanisms cannot be readily altered or bypassed.
<p>
        Also unlike Clipper, which required a special tamper-proof
microprocessor that would have added cost, complexity and extra power
requirements to communications devices, the new proposals can be
implemented entirely in software.
<p>
        Key escrow systems make a lot of sense for most American companies,
at least for internal use. Having a spare set of keys lessens the risk of a
disgruntled employee or saboteur locking up vital company files.
<p>
        But key escrow is also unpopular with American computer and
software companies, who say it prevents them from competing against foreign
companies that have no similar constraints, and with many multinational
corporations, who say it prevents them from working with foreign companies
that don't especially care for the idea of Uncle Sam holding the keys to
their data banks.
<p>
        "If this was intended to be any sort of compromise, I don't think
it achieved its end," said Whitfield Diffie, a Distinguished Engineer at
Sun Microsystems who attended the meetings. "I didn't see anybody who was
enthusiastic."
<p>
        ***
<p>
        Raymond G. Kammer, deputy director of NIST, suggested that the
hearings last week were intended to elicit public comment, and that the
Administration's final positions on cryptographic policy are still under
analysis.
<p>
        However, the emergence of key escrow issues at the NIST proceedings
suggest that key escrow is emerging as a non-negotiable demand by some
factions of the Clinton Administration, especially the Justice Department
and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, led by Louis Freeh. Mr. Freeh
sincerely believes that data encryption is a weapon, and has publicly
called for domestic restrictions on civilian cryptography.
<p>
        "If this fails," said one observer familiar with the
Administration's thinking on the proposed change in cryptographic policy,
"it's going to lead to a very devisive debate. And the irony, for
libertarians who oppose key escrow, is that if it fails, I am convinced
that Louis Freeh cannot be true to his job without proposing domestic
controls on data encryption."
<p>
        "He's not going to give up without a fight, and neither is the
Justice Department," said the observer, who spoke on the condition he not
be identified.
<p>
        Others say they do not think the Clinton Administration has yet
arrived at a concrete position, even after more than a year of study and
debate. "I don't think it's a final offer," said John Gilmore, a member of
the board of directors of Cygnus Support Inc., a computer company in
Mountain View, Calif. "It looks to me like a weak strawman, a first offer,
a proposal to dance."
<p>
        The question is whether American citizens and businesses have the
patience to wait for the music to start. And the issue may be moot, anyway.
<p>
        "The Internet Architecture Board has specifically decided to ignore
export controls in designing the security infrastructure for the next
generation of Internet protocols," Mr. Gilmore said. "The Internet of 1998
will provide automatic, secure, and fully private communication, without
key escrow, internationally. The protocols will be implemented
independently in a dozen different countries."
<p>
        In other words, the international Internet community is already
planning to jump over the new line in the sand drawn last week by the
Clinton Administration. Cryptography that is stronger and better than the
Government's proposed system will become an integral part of the Internet,
and American companies and individuals would be foolish not to use it.
<p>
        At that point, millions of Americans will come in direct conflict
with Government policy, and the popular gun-control bumper sticker may be
replaced by one that says, "If cryptography is outlawed, only outlaws will
have cryptography."

<TITLE>8th IEEE CS Computer Security Foundations Workshop Summary</TITLE>
<H2>Summary of the 8th IEEE Computer Security Foundations Workshop</H2>
Dromquinna, Kenmare, County Kerry, Ireland, June 13-15, 1995<p>
by Simon Foley
<br>
<i>[The following article will appear in the next issue of SIGSAC Review
and appears here with permission of its editor, Catherine Meadows, and 
the author.  This piece supplements Cipher's earlier account by Trent
Jaeger in EI#7.  Simon Foley chaired the meeting reported.-- CEL]</i>
<HR>
<p>
The purpose of the Computer Security Foundations Workshop is to bring
together researchers to explore fundamental issues in computer security.
Each year, papers and panel sessions are presented in foundational areas
such as: access control, cryptographic protocols, database security,
integrity and availability, information flow, and formal methods for
security.
<p>
This year the workshop was held in Dromquinna Manor, Kenmare, County Kerry,
Ireland, June 13-15, 1995. It was the first time the workshop was held
outside the USA. Dromquinna Manor, situated on a peninsula on the south-west
coast of Ireland, provided the kind of peaceful environment, in an idyllic
setting, that has become synonymous with the workshop. The number of
submissions to the workshop were up on the previous three years, perhaps due
in part to the attractive venue, but most certainly due to the lively
technical discussions that can be expected during the workshop. It was the
hard work of Program Chair Li Gong(SRI, USA), Program Committee, authors and
panelists, that made the workshop such a success.
<p>
The first session, chaired by Simon Foley, was on Composition and comprised
of three papers about relationships between information flow properties and
composition. In his presentation of The Composability of Non-Interference
(A. Zakinthinos and E.S. Lee, U. Toronto, Canada), Aris Zakinthinos proposed
a novel, composable, non-interference property that permitted a degree of
feedback. He argued that non-interference was more appealing (than
restrictiveness), because unlike restrictiveness, it has a more intuitive
feel and a larger class of systems satisfy the property. Lars Wulf presented
Composing and Decomposing Systems under Security Properties, co-authored
with A.W. Roscoe (both Oxford U., UK). He argued that a more expressive
model than traces should be used when capturing information flow properties
in CSP. The authors studied separability, and its relationship to
composition, in terms of the failures-divergences model. A conclusion was
that separability is not a sound property for systems that have (internal)
nondeterminism. The final paper, Algebraic Properties of System Composition
in the Loral, Ulysses and McLean Trace Models was presented by Alfred Maneki
(DOD, USA), who gave a catalogue of algebraic properties for the three
information flow properties. His conclusion was one of caution: one should
be mindful of how compositions are made, even if the property is composable.
<p>
Michael Reiter (AT&T Bell Labs, USA) chaired the session on Authentication
Protocols. Li Gong, was to present a paper, Optimal Authentication Protocols
Resistant to Password Guessing Attacks, but in the tradition of CSFW
spontaneity, he proposed instead, ten foundational issues for computer
security. They were: secure initial access (by universal authentication
format); high integrity and easily accessible pseudo-random number
generators; highly available non-tamperable global time service on internet;
sensible placement of security mechanisms within internet; secure,
dynamically constituted groups; provably secure protocols; refinement of
security properties and specifications; secure (heterogeneous) system
composition; secure system inter-operation, and sensible integration of
security and fault tolerance.
<p>
The second paper, Key Distribution without Individual Trusted Authentication
Servers, was presented by Liqun Chen (co-authors, D. Gollmann and C.
Mitchell, all U. London). Chen described the problem of establishing secure
(symmetric) channels between entities who share no secret, and where some
authentication servers cannot be trusted. The advantages, over existing
solutions, of their protocol, include, less (and smaller) messages, greater
choice of hash function, and a lower computational complexity.
<p>
The session after lunch, Analysis of Cryptographic Protocols was chaired by
Gene Tsudik (IBM, Switzerland). Colin Boyd (U. Manchester, UK), presented
Towards a Classification of Key Agreement Protocols, and advised caution
when selecting hash functions. His `menagerie' of hash functions (acronyms,
BOW, MIOW and WOOF), help in classifying key agreement protocols into three
different types, which he described. The second speaker, Wenbo Mao (HP Labs,
UK) proposed An Augmentation of BAN-Like Logics. He noted that errors are
easily made during the protocol idealization step. His approach does not
change the axioms of the logic, but proposes that stages of the idealization
be described using new operators.
<p>
After a break for cream teas on the lawns of Dromquinna, the first day was
concluded by a panel session on What Makes a Cryptographic Protocol
Dependable? The moderator was Catherine Meadows (NRL, USA), with panelists
Colin Boyd, Dieter Gollmann and Michael Merritt (AT&T Bell Labs, USA). The
motivation for the panel was that there exists a large body of work
describing various conditions that cryptographic protocols should satisfy to
be reliable/dependable. However, these requirements are often contradictory
when taken together.
<p>
Colin Boyd's position was that we should follow the formal top down
principles of dependable systems development. He suggested a layered
approach, with refinement between layers providing correctness: first,
specify the security requirements for messages in the system; second,
design/describe the protocol in an abstract manner, but avoid details about
specific cryptographic algorithms, and third, implement. He argued that many
existing protocols are not specified properly, feeling that approaches such
as using CSP/FDR are good because they force the specifier to be precise. In
light of this Bob Morris wondered do we even know what cryptographic
protocols are intended to do in the first place?
<p>
Dieter Gollmann also asked this same question of protocols and repudiation,
suggesting that the problem is, not being able to focus on what we want to
talk about. He agreed with Boyd's layered approach and argued that when
designing protocols we should: always use the correct level of abstraction;
disassociate signature from encryption with a secret key; keep proofs a
distance from protocol, and make all initial assumptions on keys, nonces and
algorithm explicit.
<p>
Michael Merritt wondered if insight could be gained by taking the viewpoint
of dependable protocols as a form of fault tolerant distributed algorithms.
With fault tolerance one is interested in the reachable states of a system,
while with a protocol, we are interested in the reachable states of an
adversary. However, he pointed to a number of problems that make developing
dependable protocols harder. He felt that secure refinement will be a
difficult problem, especially given that an adversary attacks the
implementation, not the specification. He suggested that refinement could be
a process of re-examining the steps from previous levels to make sure they
still hold. Bill Roscoe agreed that refinement of specifications involving
true nondeterminism is very hard. John McLean wondered if properties like
subliminal channels might get overlooked by refinement and suggested that
perhaps refinement should be viewed as just a way to narrow down what one
needs to look at when developing a protocol.
<p>
Mark Lomas outlined a system which used two individually `dependable'
protocols together in such a way that they failed. Others had similar
experiences, often due to protocol assumptions not being made explicit.
Michael Merritt wondered how we specify `you do not do anything incredibly
stupid', and suggested analyzing substitution attacks as a way to avoid
problems of extending protocols later on. Li Gong felt that at the protocol
level we should not be concerned with low-level details about crypto-system
attacks etc., making it even harder to analyze. He argued that it is the
person who codes the protocol who should ask the relevant questions about
what appropriate ciphers to use.
<p>
Before chairing the first session of day two, Jonathan Millen (MITRE, USA)
asked the audience to consider the state of computer security foundations
and its relationship to the photograph of Staigue Fort on the proceeding's
cover (an early medieval stone fort near Dromquinna Manor). He speculated
that the fort looked like a foundation, but nothing was ever built on it and
furthermore, it was crumbling on top!
<p>
The first paper in this session on Issues in Implementations was The
Security Checker: A Semantics-based Tool for the Verification of Security
Properties, by R. Focardi, R. Gorrieri and V. Panini (U. Bologna, Italy). In
his talk, Ricardo Focardi, described work on adapting the CCS Concurrency
Workbench to model-check information flow properties of CCS style
specifications. The checking algorithms have poor(some exponential), worst
case complexity results. However, in practice the authors have found the
time and space requirements for the algorithms to be reasonable, especially
if algebraic properties (for example, parallel composition) of the security
property are used to reduce the number of states to be checked.
<p>
Trent Jaeger presented Implementation of a Discretionary Access Control
Model for Script-based Systems (co-author Atul Prakash, both from U.
Michigan, USA). He proposed an access control model tailored specifically
for script based systems. The model provides roles for processes running
command scripts: accesses are determined by the rights of the process and
script author. The model has been implemented using Safe-Tcl under Kerberos
and Taos. In the absence of the authors, J.V. Janeri (MITRE, USA), D.B.
Darby and D.D. Schnackenberg (Boeing, USA), Jonathan Millen presented their
paper Building Higher Resolution Synthetic Clocks for Signaling in Covert
Timing Channels. Millen described a network LAN covert channel, and its
countermeasures, based on process scheduling. Controlling the channel by
adjusting clock granularity can conflict with the timing requirements of
network software. This was exemplified by the discovery of an
Heisenberg-like principle: the covert channel worked when debugging code 
was present in the software, but decayed when it was removed!
<p>
Michael Merritt chaired the session on cryptographic protocols, which
focused on using algebraic techniques for verifying protocols (as opposed to
BAN style approaches). A.W. Roscoe's paper was on Modeling and Verifying
Key-Exchange Protocols using CSP and FDR, but he spoke about subsequent
ongoing work at Oxford with P. Gardiner, G. Lowe and M. Goldsmith. Their
approach is to use CSP to describe the agents in the protocol (responder,
server, initiator, adversary) and use the FDR tool to model check safety and
liveness properties of the protocol. The second paper, Using Temporal logic
to Specify and Verify Cryptographic Protocols (Progress Report), by J.W.
Gray III (Hong Kong U. of Science and Technology) and J. McLean, was
presented by John McLean. The goal of their research is to provide a single
logic in which requirements specification, protocol specification and proof
of correctness can all be done within the same formalism. In this respect,
they have effectively recast the Prolog, context free grammar and temporal
logic components of the NRL protocol analyzer tool into Lamport's Raw
Temporal Logic of Actions. The session adjourned for lunch, which was had
down by the sea shore.
<p>
The session on Secure Systems was chaired by John McLean. Tom Keefe (Penn
State, USA) presented Concurrency Control for Federated Multilevel Secure
Database Systems (co-author I.E. Kang, GTE Labs, USA). He explained their
interest in building federated multilevel DBMS on top of autonomous,
pre-existing multilevel DBMS systems. Their approach uses a secure
validation protocol which ensures serializability across the federation,
maintains local autonomy of individual DBMS and ensures multilevel security.
While their protocol currently requires the security lattices of local
DBMS's to be total, the resulting lattice for the secure federation is not
necessarily total. Keefe also described a novel method for untrusted
timestamp generation that can be used in their protocol. Jeremy Jacob
(University of York, UK) presented the paper Specifying Security for CSCW
Systems (co-author, S. Foley). He described what the authors believe to be a
reasonable method for specifying functionality and security
(confidentiality) requirements for CSCW applications. Testing the method
against a simple case study, they were surprised that security turned out to
be very simple to specify. Jacob suggested that this came about as a result
of the way the application is modularized, and because so much is captured
by the functionality requirements.
<p>
The panel session Considering the Common Criteria concluded the second day,
with moderator Jane Sinclair (Open University, UK) and panelists, Jeremy
Jacob, Jonathan Millen and Bronia Szczygiel(NPL, UK). Jane Sinclair gave the
motivation for the panel and asked a number of questions about the Criteria
she hoped we might find answers for.
<p>
The first panelist, Jonathan Millen, outlined the key components of the
Criteria, described how it might be used, and gave pointers to those aspects
of the Criteria that are open to opportunities to do further technical work
(practically everything). He noted that the Criteria typically defines what
is required, but gives no assistance on how to do it; he felt that further
support/guidance documentation should be provided. He finished with the
meta-challenge: do we really know enough to do what is required by the
Criteria?
<p>
Jeremy Jacob felt there little trace of the security foundations community
in the Criteria documentation, and asked if the people developing it are
paying any attention to us, or do we have anything to offer them anyhow?
John McLean noted that the Orange book did enshrine the view of the
technical community, and halted them in their tracks.
<p>
Bronia Szczygiel argued that the Criteria does not meet user's needs, is
incomplete and inflexible and should address the integrity of the entire
enterprise, not just the computer system. But she felt that its principles
were good, i.e., addressing what your security is, rather than low-level
details. She suggested that conformance testing for security can give an
added objectivity that is not got from evaluation alone.
<p>
There was speculation from the audience as to whether `evaluated to CC' was
like `Intel Inside': will it help sell systems? This was countered by,
perhaps it is a warning. This seemed indicative of audience's mood: one of
skepticism on whether it would be used in commercial practice. Perhaps,
using the Criteria is like the Irish dancing seen that night in Dromquinna:
just a lot of fancy footwork?
<p>
The session for the final day of the workshop, Information Flow was chaired
by Joshua Guttman (MITRE, USA). Paul Syverson(NRL, USA) presented a paper
The Epistemic Representation of Information Flow Security in Probabilistic
Systems, co-author J.W. Gray III. He outlined a logic for security in which
information flows due to time and probability can be accounted for. Their
logic, iss built on the standard Halpern-Tuttle model of knowledge and
probability in systems, and represents a bringing together of previous work
in the areas of noninterference and epistemic logic for modeling security.
Connection Policies and Controlled Interference, by W.R. Bevier, R.M. Cohen
and W.D. Young (Computational Logic, USA) was presented by Bill Young. He
described a generalization of their work (presented at this workshop last
year) on intransitive non-interference. Typical intransitive noninterference
requirements are at the granularity of agents: whether agents may/may not
interfere. Controlled noninterference permits a finer granularity by using
connection policies to define what channels connect agents, and effectively
capture how agents may/may not interfere with each other. He concluded by
examining related work on intransitive noninterference, separability and
type enforcement(assured pipelines).
<p>
We were fortunate to have three days of glorious sunshine, giving delegates
the opportunity to discuss their research over walks by the sea, across
mountains, and as with every previous year, over games of croquet.
Congratulations to this year's Croquet Tournament winner, Bill Roscoe, and
the runner-up Aris Zakinthinos. At the business meeting, held after the last
session, it was agreed to use Dromquinna Manor as the workshop venue for
1996. The workshop will run June 10--12, 1996. Simon Foley will remain as
General Chair and the Programme Chair will be Michael Merritt. For further

<TITLE>SUMMERCON '95 Conference Report</TITLE>
<H2>SUMMERCON '95 Conference Report</H2>
by Vincent Reed, MITRE
<p>
SUMMERCON, a hackers' conference conducted in the past on an
"invitation only" basis, was opened to the public this year as
SUMMERCON '95, sponsored by Phrack Magazine and Computer Security
Technologies.  Because of this new open format and some mainstream
speakers (e.g., Winn Schwartau and Bob Stratton), I decided to attend
and record the event for dissemination to the Information Systems
Security community.
<p>
Chris Goggans, editor of Phrack, opened the conference Saturday
morning, June 3, and introduced the first speaker, Robert Steele.  Mr.
Steele talked about hacking from an intelligence prospective.  He said
that with all of the security problems we currently have, industry is
criminally negligent.  He compared the security posture of the United
States to the emperor without clothes whose nakedness almost everyone
fears to declare.  He suggested that hackers seek jobs either in the
military or in companies where they can apply their skills in small
doses.  Mr. Steele said that he wants to highlight the security
problems we have through publicity and litigation.  He said that we
have information systems with no safety net and that we could lose
systems for weeks.  He proposed that workers make vulnerabilities
public.  He further stated that unprotected systems are inviting the
hacker in, and the hackers should not be prosecuted.  He said that he
was not as concerned about foreign countries as he is about
international crime organizations.  The US is not prepared, and no one
in Washington is in charge, according to him.  The DOD is working the
problem, but the intelligence community is out of control.  Mr. Steele
then asked, "When is healthy misconduct good for society?" and he said
that when he thinks of that question he thinks of hackers.  He said
that we currently occupy a house built over a sink-hole.
<p>
Eric Hughes spoke next, describing a remailer used to conceal the
identity of the sender.  He said that there are 20 remailers running
with three-fourths of them in the US.  Mr. Hughes said that many people
will be performing international electronic financial transactions
within a couple of years.  The number of off-shore bank accounts is
increasing, he said, because of relaxed regulations, and this will
result in new security issues that must be addressed.  He cited the
Swiss as an example and said that if it is not illegal under Swiss law
you do not have a problem.  Bermuda, which plans to install high speed
lines to the US, Venezuela, and Spain, is another example.  "Regulatory
arbitrage" is an important term to remember, he said.  Countries work
with each other based on anarchy even though there is international
law.  This makes international arbitrage easy on the Internet because
of "locational ambiguity," and he recommends that money remailers be
locationally ambiguous.  This service requires remote auditing using
encryption, he said,  and many banks in the Caribbean will fail as the
bank officials embezzle their clients' money, because they will not
want to be audited so tightly.
<p>
"Unauthorized Access," a video on hacking told from the hacker's
perspective, was next presented by its maker, Annaliza Savage.  The
video started with one hacker contending that phone and communications
companies take advantage of consumers.  Phyber Optic was then
interviewed and said that he was just "checking out things just like
others."  He contended that he was used to send a message and that he
is mad about it.  The commentator then said that Secret Agent turned
state's evidence but is still on the run for credit card fraud.  Noah's
parents were interviewed next and said that Noah was visited by the
Secret Service, but they did not understand, because they equated what
he did to petty crimes, like vandalism.  The Secret Service used too
heavy a hand, according to them.  Noah's mother said that if she had
known what he was doing, she would have done whatever it would take to
stop him.  Next, the video showed someone breaking into a server, a
phone phreaking session, and several people searching through the
trash, followed by a 2600 sequence and a HoHoCON sequence.  Several
European sequences followed, including one on Hack-Tic.  Even though
this video was developed from the hacker's perspective, it is a good
security awareness tape.  Ms.  Savage can be contacted through the web
at URL: http://bianca.com/bump/ua/ [This didn't work for me --CEL]
<p>
A pirate tape of three people breaking into a phone company Electronic
Switching Station was shown next.  The three wore masks and ran through
the station, playing with the equipment.  At one point, one accessed a
database and gave some phone additional calling features for free.
Another called a 900 line using a maintenance phone.  Most of the
time was just spent clowning around, but the intruders did show a 
very good understanding of the ESS.
<p>
Bob Stratton then discussed Internet issues.  He discussed TCP/IP
protocols and their impact on Internet security.  The Internet is a net
of nets and no one is running it:  all hosts are equal and you need to
learn whom you can trust.   We cannot depend on IP addresses, because
they can be spoofed.  Security is moving from being a restrictive
technology to an enabling technology, he said.   Encryption should be
like a feature on a stereo in that a light comes on when it's working
(i.e., transparent to user).  Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) will
bring security features: IP Security Authentication Header,
Encapsulating Security Payload, Security Associations/Security
Parameter Index, and Key Management.  He said that security will become
transparent to the user with IPv6.  Mr. Stratton also stressed the
point made by Robert Steele that vendors have been grossly negligent.
<p>
Winn Schwartau spoke next on electromagnetic eavesdropping.  He said
NSA had a classified program called TEMPEST and that it only came out
of the closet after a paper was written in Europe.  He then played a
tape produced by the BBC on electronic eavesdropping.  While the film
was somewhat dated, it showed the threat to totally unprotected
commercial systems is real.  Even with this demonstration, the British
had a hard time generating a commercial market for TEMPEST products.
Mr. Schwartau then discussed Magnetic Weapon Systems, such as HERF
guns.  He distributed a drawing of a 16 megawatt HERF gun that he
contended could take down systems up to 100 feet away.  He then showed
another video on EMI at low levels.  The video presented many serious
EMI problems related to airlines and hospitals, such as wheelchairs out
of control.  Many of the people attending the conference found these
stories funny.  Mr. Schwartau then said the rumor that we used a virus
in a printer to defeat Iraqi air defenses during the Gulf War was
incorrect;  instead we used magnetic weapon systems on cruise missiles
to jam the Iraqi air defenses.  He concluded by saying that we must
consider some terrorist organization using magnetic weapon systems to
damage our financial systems.
<p>
Chris Goggans concluded the conference with a discussion on international
hacking.  He said that the hacker community is anarchist and attacks
in all directions.  He suggested that the community needed focus and
recommended that they all get together and attack some foreign country,
such as France.
<p>
While I have attended conferences like this in the past and have found them
useful for gaining a better understanding of one's adversary, this
conference offered something new.  This conference attracted more
mainstream security professionals and I saw some real exchange of
understanding on both sides.  This exchange is important because ethics and
moral behavior are not paramount concerns of most of the crackers.  They
see themselves on some moral mission to crack the systems they encounter.
They have the anti-establishment mentality of the 60's hippie generation.
If our goal is to make our systems as secure as possible, then we need to
also work on changing attitudes.  I do not think that any miracles occurred
along those lines at SUMMERCON '95, but some important steps were taken.

<TITLE>Report on 33st Internet Engineering Task Force Meeting</TITLE>
<H2>Report on 33st Internet Engineering Task Force Meeting</H2>
by Avi Rubin, Bellcore 
<p>
The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) held its 33rd meeting in
beautiful Stockholm, Sweden on July 17-21.  The IETF has a www home page,
<a href="http://www.ietf.cnri.reston.va.us/home.html">
http://www.ietf.cnri.reston.va.us/home.html</a>, where more information can
be found. Briefly, the IETF is the protocol engineering and development
arm of the Internet. The IETF is a large open international community
of network designers, operators, vendors, and researchers concerned
with the evolution of the Internet architecture and the smooth
operation of the Internet. It is open to any interested individual. The
actual technical work of the IETF is done in its working groups, which
are organized by topic into several areas (e.g., routing, network
management, security, etc.).
<p>
The July meeting had about 1000 participants, up from about 850 that
attended in April. The large attendance was surprising given the large
number of Americans that participate in the IETF, but if you're on a
limited travel budget, Stockholm is definitely a trip you don't want
to miss. The conference took place at the Grand hotel, the oldest
hotel in Stockholm, and situated in the heart of downtown, across
the water from Old Town.
<p>
There were several working group (WG) meetings and three Birds of
Feather (BOF) sessions. The working groups that met were web
transaction security (WTS), authenticated firewall traversal (AFT),
IP layer security (IPSEC), common authentication technologies (CAT),
site security handbook (SSH). Groups that did not meet include 
domain name security (DNS), privacy enchanced mail (PEM), and one-
time passwords (OTP). The BOF's that were held were secure
socket layer (SSL), electronic payments, and SKIP. The last day
of the conference was reserved for technical talks, and several
talks were given on electronic payment protocols. These talks differed
from the ones in the working group in that the audience consisted
of the entire IETF community, rather than just the security crowd.
<p>
By far the most controversial sessions were the two electronic
payment BOF's. The meetings were chaired by Amir Herzberg of IBM.
The first meeting consisted of two hours of technical presentations
of various protocols for electronic payment. Among the presentations
were iKP by Gene Tsudik of IBM, Netscape's e-payment scheme presented
by Taher ElGamal, secure transaction technology by Microsoft/Visa,
Cybercash by Steve Crocker and Don Eastlake, Netcheck by Cliff
Neuman of USC/ISS, and also presentations by Win Treese of OpenMarket
and Spyglass. One observation made by many is that most of the payment
protocols resembled each other not only architecturally, but in the
messages as well. This was encouraging towards the possibility of
merging the protocols into one standard.
<p>
Then came the second session. The purpose of this session was to
discuss the formation of a working group and a draft charter that
was proposed by Amir. It was an interesting and often fiery discussion
that resulted. At one point it seemed that no working group should be 
formed, then a bit later, it appeared that 4 or 5 working groups might
be needed. In the end, a consensus was reached (an IETF word meaning 
that nobody is really happy, but the fewest number of people don't like
the idea) that the best idea would be to have one or two working
groups with a very narrow focus, designed to solve a particular
problem. It was also agreed to ignore the fact that the credit
card companies plan to announce their protocol in September. Within
the 24 hours following the second meeting, there were two draft
proposals submitted to Jeff Schiller, the area director for security.
For more information on the electronic payments activity, there
are two mailing lists: e-payment@cc.bellcore.com for general discussion
and ietf-payments@cc.bellcore.com for charter and working group information.  
To subscribe to either of these lists, send mail to 
<address>majordomo@cc.bellcore.com</address>
with: 'subscribe group-name' in the body of the message. The archives
are in 
<a href="ftp://thumper.bellcore.com/pub/rubin/">
ftp://thumper.bellcore.com/pub/rubin/</a>
EPAY-i and PAYMENTS-i.
<p>
In the SSL BOF, Taher ElGamal did not present the SSL scheme. This was
presented at the previous meeting in Danvers last April. Instead, the
group discussed the viability of having an IETF standard for a commercial
product. Also, it was suggested that this work might belong in the web
transaction security group. Finally, a consensus was reached that it
probably is worthwhile to have a separate group devoted to session
layer security so that kernel modifications are not necessary. The SSL
draft will be the first draft submitted to the session layer security
group, and ElGamal assured that Netscape would give change control of
the draft to the working group (although no papers were signed).
One other interesting point is that there was general agreement that
X.509 certificates should not be a requirement for session layer security.
The mailing list for the group is session-layer-security@netscape.com,
and to subscribe, send mail to <address>
session-layer-security-request@netscape.com</address>.
<p>
In the IPSEC meeting, Mark Schertler of the NSA presented the ISAKMP
framework for key management message exchanges. It was generally agreed
that this is a good idea, although it was suggested by Steve Bellovin
that it might be too flexible. The details are being worked out. 
The other key management protocol is Photuris. The author, Phil Karn,
was not present, and this proposal was not discussed at the meeting.
Meanwhile, the following documents have been moved to proposed standard:
draft-ietf-ipsec-arch-00.txt -esp- -auth- -esp-des-cbc-03.txt -ah-md5-02.
That means that there will be a general last call for comments, and
when they are approved by the IESG, they will become RFC standards.
At the end of the meeting, Don Eastlake presented the work being done
by DNS security and how it ties in with IPSEC because there was no
DNS security meeting this time. Basically, the work being done by
the DNS is to include information containing certificates within
the domain name structure to distribute long-term keys. The mailing
list for IPSEC is at ipsec@ans.net, and the archive can be found
at <a href="ftp://ftp.ans.net">ftp://ftp.ans.net</a>.
<p>
The web transaction security (WTS) working group is chaired by
Charlie Kaufman. The first speaker was Simon Cooper from Network Services
at Rutgers. He presented an API called RUSSL 
(<a href="http://www-ns.rutgers.edu/RUSSL/">
http://www-ns.rutgers.edu/RUSSL/</a>)
which provides the following services: an encrypt channel, service 
authentication, client authentication (If service request it), message 
authentication, protection against message replay, and status callback that 
allow GUI applications to provide transaction progress. The next speaker was
Doug Rosenthal from EINet Corp. He proposed a new URL type, gss_http, which
would provide a GSSAPI for web transactions. Other speakers were
Alan Schiffman who discussed some issues with regard to SHTTP, and then
Simon Cooper spoke again about the requirements for WTS. The session
ended with a decision to come up with a requirements document within
the next month.
<p>
The AFT group is working on standardizing SOCKS version 5. SOCKS provides
proxy services. The current draft is draft-ietf-aft-socks-protocol-v5-03.txt,
which is undergoing several revisions. The BOF on SKIP demonstrated
that there might be more than one approach to key management at the
IP layer. SKIP differs from other proposals in that there is no key
management. Instead, key information is embedded in every IP packet.
There is some resistance to this in the IPSEC, but Schiller suggested
that if the IPSEC crowd does not get their act together, SKIP might
stand a good chance because it is available and it works.
<p>
The CAT working group met for two sessions at the Stockholm IETF.
Topics related to active documents included GSS-V2 (to receive another
set of specific revisions at the Internet-Draft level, and then to be
recommended for advancement to Proposed Standards), IDUP (where
revised interface specs and a new mechanism spec were discussed, with
standards advancement to be considered at the next IETF), GSS-API
Negotiation, Kerberos mechanism and extensions, FTP Security
(to be recommended for advancement to Proposed Standard after
inclusion of clarifying revisions), and a presentation of a new
mechanism based on FIPS PUB JJJ cryptography.  Presentations on work
in progress included GSS-API integration into World-Wide Web browsers
and servers, loadable GSS-API multi-mechanism support, and discussion
of use of RFC-1731 as a generic framework for integration of security
tokens into text-based applications.  The group also discussed a range
of candidate follow-on topic areas related to authorization, and
identified a subset with apparent common value and feasibility for
proposals and work by group members.
<p>
The OTP group did not meet. It is currently working on standardizing
the S/KEY. The PEM group did not meet as well. The MOSS documents
in that group are moving along through the standards process, and Jeff
Schiller is considering closing down the PEM group after that.
<p>
Finally, at the end of the IETF conference, the Security Area Advisory
Group (SAAG) met. In this meeting, all of the security work that took
place at the conference was summarized, including reports from all the
working groups. Jeff Schiller, the area director for security, ran the
meeting. Amir Herzberg suggested that it might make sense to have a 
special working group devoted to key management for hosts, rather than
have each group come up with key management protocols. Schiller dismissed
the idea pointing out that in a sense, this is what IPSEC is doing anyway.
<p>
The next IETF meeting will be in Dallas, Texas on December 4-8, 1995.

<TITLE>Crypto Law Survey</TITLE>
<H2>Crypto Law Survey</H2>
by Bert-Jaap Koops (<i>koops@kub.nl</i>)
Version July 1995, PLEASE CREDIT IF QUOTING 
<p>
This survey of cryptography laws is based on several reports and on 
replies to a posting on Internet discussion lists. Only for France, The 
Netherlands, and Russia have I consulted original texts of relevant
regulations; for the other countries, the reports listed below served as 
the only source. These findings, therefore, do not pretend to be 
exhaustive or fully reliable.  I thank all who have provided me with 
information for this survey. Please send comments, corrections, updates, 
additional information, and questions to <address>E.J.Koops@kub.nl</address>.

<HR>
<H3>COCOM</H3>
 <br>1. COCOM (Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls) 
  is an international organization (Japan, Australia, and all NATO
  members, Ireland excluded) for the mutual control (and restriction) of 
  strategic arms export. It maintains, among others, the International 
  Industrial List and the International Munitions List. In 1991, COCOM 
  has decided to allow export of mass-market cryptographic software 
  (including public domain software). Some member countries of COCOM 
  follow its regulations, but others, such as Germany and the
  United States, maintain separate regulations.
<H3>Australia [1, 3]</H3>
 <br>1. Written permission is needed for exporting cryptographic equipment 
  designed to ensure the secrecy of communications or stored information.
 <br>2. no
 <br>3. no
<H3>Austria [1]</H3>
 <br>2. no
 <br>3. no
<H3>Belgium [1, 3]</H3>
   <br>1. no
   <br>2. no
   <br>3. no
<H3>Brazil [3]</H3>
   <br>1. no
<H3>Canada [1, 3, 4, 5]</H3>
 <br>1. Canada follows COCOM regulations. The exportation of items from 
  Canada may be subject to restriction if they are included on the Export 
  Control List. All types of cryptography can be transported between 
  Canada and the United States, but cryptography imported from the US 
  remains under US ITAR rules and cannot be exported if the US does not 
  allow export.
 <br>2. no
 <br>3. no (but Canada is monitoring the debate in the US)
<H3>People's Republic of China [3]</H3>
 <br>1.China restricts the importation and exportation of voice-encoding 
  devices.
<H3>Denmark [1, 4]</H3>
 <br>2. no
 <br>3. no
 <br>4. The Danish Teletrust Group has set up an Encryption Group to work
  on the technical and legal concept of public-key certifying authorities.   
  A Centre Certifying Authority (CCA) would coordinate control and 
  certification of key centres to provide secure keys within 
  telecommunications. It would be necessary for such a CCA to have a
  legal basis. The Danish government has not (yet) implemented the 
  initiative into law.
<H3>European Union [5]</H3>
 <br>2. no
 <br>3. There are rumours that the EU is working on the establishment of a 
  key escrow system to counter the US Clipper initiative. The EU system 
  would allow member states to choose escrow agents where keys have to 
  be deposited. The European Community's Green Book on the Security
  of Information Systems (Draft 4.0, 18 October 1993) poses a case for
  the provision of "Public Confidentiality Services" (which offer some 
  sort of Government Access to Keys).
<H3>Finland [4, 5]</H3>
 <br>2. no
 <br>3. no
<H3>France [1, 3, 4]</H3>
 <br>1. a) For exporting authentication- or integrity-only cryptography, a 
  declaration dossier of export delivery must be deposited. A copy of the 
  receipt of declaration must be presented to customs at each exportation. 
  For temporary exportation, a user declaration will serve as export 
  declaration in the case of cryptography used exclusively for personal 
  use by an individual. A delivery declaration will serve as temporary-
  export declaration for a sample.
  b) For exporting any other kind of cryptography, apart from once 
  depositing administrative and technical details needed for user or 
  delivery authorisation, a license is needed for each exportation.
<br>2. Delivery, exportation, and use of cryptography are subjected to:
  a) previous declaration if the cryptography can have no other object 
  than authenticating communications or assuring the integrity of 
  transmitted messages;
  b) previous authorisation by the Prime Minister in all other cases. 
  Simplified procedures exist for certain cryptography products or certain 
  user categories.
  For both declaration and authorisation, a dossier containing technical 
  details and administrative data must be submitted. Authorisation can be 
  subjected to certain conditions in order to reserve the use of certain 
  types of cryptography to defined user or application categories.
  It is unclear to what extent this regulation is being maintained in 
  practice.
  It seems impossible for individuals or enterprises to obtain 
  authorisation for "strong" cryptography, such as RSA. Moreover, the 
  office dealing with authorisation renders decisions without motivation.
<H3>Germany [1, 3, 4, 5]</H3>
 <br>1. COCOM regulations, but Germany maintains export control of both 
  public domain and mass-market encryption software.
 <br>2. no
 <br>3. Some politicians have expressed a desire to regulate cryptography, 
  but, on the whole, there seems to be no threat that Germany will prepare 
  a law on cryptography.  
<H3>Hungary [5]</H3>
 <br>2. no
 <br>3. no
 <br>4. There is a law that provides an agency with the competence to assess 
  cryptography; the agency can declare that it satisfies a minimum 
  security level.  
<H3>Iceland [1]</H3>
 <br>2. no
 <br>3. no  
<H3>India [3]</H3>
 <br>1. no  
<H3>Ireland [1]</H3>
 <br>2. no
 <br>3. no
<H3>Israel [3]</H3>
 <br>1. Israel imposes restrictions on encryption, but the scope of its 
  restrictions is not clear.
<H3>Italy [1, 3]</H3>
 <br>1. COCOM regulations.
 <br>2. There is a law that demands accessibility of encrypted records for 
  the treasury.
 <br>3. no
<H3>Japan [1, 3]</H3>
 <br>1. COCOM regulations.
 <br>2. no
 <br>3. no
<H3>Latvia [4]</H3>
 <br>2. no
 <br>3. no
<H3>Mexico [3]</H3>
 <br>1. no
<H3>The Netherlands [3, 4, 5]</H3>
 <br>1. Public domain and mass-market software generally does not require a 
  validated license. Items capable of file encryption do require a 
  validated license.
 <br>2. no
 <br>3. In March 1994, a Dutch predraft law on cryptography leaked out, the 
  drift of which was a prohibition of having, using, or trading strong 
  cryptography. Those with a "legitimate concern" could apply for a user 
  license or a trade authorization. One condition for granting a license 
  was giving information to an administration agency; the text did not 
  state whether this information concerned only the algorithm or also all 
  the keys used. After many protests from those who would be affected by 
  the proposed regulation, it was withdrawn. The Dutch authorities are 
  currently studying on alternatives to handle the issue. Although the 
  draft regulation will not be continued in its present scope, 
  it shows how much the judicial authorities fear wide dissemination of

  want to regulate encryption in some way.

 <br>4. A bill on information security has been proposed, which indicates 
  that cryptography can be used for the storage of passwords. It is not

  A bill has been proposed on central medical registries that would use 
  cryptographically pseudonimized entries.
<H3>Russia [3, 5]</H3>
 <br>1. A license is required for the importation of encryption facilities 
  manufactured abroad.
 <br>2. On 3 April 1995, president Jeltsin issued a decree prohibiting 
  unauthorized encryption. State organizations and enterprises need a 
  license to use encryption (for both authentication and secrecy, for 
  storage as well as transmission). Other enterprises and organizations 
  using uncertified cryptography do not receive state orders. The Central 
  Bank shall take measures against commercial banks that do not use 
  certified cryptography when communicating with divisions of the Central 
  Bank. The development, production, implementation, or operation of 
  cryptography without a license is prohibited.

 <br>3.  In its policy on the information superhighway, Labour states it does 
  not approve of escrowed encryption, but it wishes authorities to have 
  the power to demand decryption under judicial warrant.  It seems, then, 
  that Labour intends to penalize a refusal to comply with a demand to 
  decrypt under judicial warrant.
<H3>United States of America [1, 2, 4]</H3>
 <br>1. The International Traffic in Arms Regulation restricts export of 
  "dual-use" cryptography (that is, cryptography that can serve both 
  civilian and military purposes) by placing it on the Munitions List. For 
  (relatively strong) products that can encipher information, an export 
  license is usually issued only for use by foreign branches of American 
  enterprises and for use by financial institutions. "Weak" cryptography 
  (e.g., with a certain maximum key-length) can also be exported.
  Export of cryptography that serves only authentication or integrity 
  purposes is ruled by the Export Administration Regulations. Some types 
  of public domain software have been decontrolled and are now on the 
  Commerce Control List.
  Several initiatives, as yet unsuccessful, have been taken, both in 
  Congress and by the public, to try to mitigate the cryptography export 
  restrictions.
 <br>2. no
 <br>3. In 1993, the Clinton Administration announced the Escrowed
  Encryption Initiative (EEI), usually referred to as the Clipper
  Initiative, after its first implementation in the Clipper chip. A
  classified, secret-key algorithm, SKIPJACK, has been implemented in
  an Escrowed Encryption Standard (EES). The reported basic idea of the
  EEI is to provide citizens with a safe cryptosystem for securing
  their communications without threatening law enforcement.  The EES
  procures law enforcement access by means of a Law Enforcement Access
  Field (LEAF) that is transmitted along with each encrypted message;
  the field contains information identifying the chip used. Law
  enforcement agencies wiretapping communications encrypted with EES
  can decipher tapped messages by obtaining the two parts of the chip's
  master key that are deposited with two escrow agencies (National
  Institute of Standards and Technology and the Treasury Department's
  Automated Systems Division), provided they have a court order for the
  tapping.  The EES is a voluntary standard to be used in telephone
  communications. Privacy advocates fear that the government may
  declare escrowed encryption obligatory once it has captured a
  sufficient portion of the market. It is doubtful that EES will be
  widely accepted, though, given the skepticism with which the majority
  of US citizens presently regard escrowed encryption or government
  access to keys. On June 27, 1995, Senator Grassley introduced the
  Anti-Electronic Racketeering Act (S.974), which, if enacted, would
  virtually ban encryption. Only the use of escrow-like software would
  be an affirmative defense for those prosecuted for using
  cryptography.  The bill doesn't seem to have much support at
  present.  
 <br>4. The Utah Digital Signatures Act of 1995 provides a legal
  framework for the use of cryptography for authentication and
  integrity purposes.

<TITLE>European Commission Adopts Directive on Protection of Personal Data
</TITLE>
<H2>European Commission Adopts Directive on Protection of Personal Data</H2>
<br>
<pre>
EUROPEAN COMMISSION PRESS RELEASE: IP/95/822
DOCUMENT DATE: JULY 25, 1995

COUNCIL DEFINITIVELY ADOPTS DIRECTIVE ON PROTECTION OF PERSONAL DATA</H3>
</pre>
<p>
The Directive on the protection of personal data has been formally adopted
by the Council of Ministers. ``I am pleased that this important measure,
which will ensure a high level of protection for the privacy of 
individuals in all Member States, has been adopted with a very wide 
measure of agreement within the Council and European Parliament'' 
commented Single Market Commissioner Mario Monti. ``The Directive will 
also help to ensure the free flow of Information Society services in the 
Single Market by fostering consumer confidence and minimising differences 
between Member States' rules.  Moreover, the text agreed includes special 
provisions for journalists, which reconcile the right to privacy with 
freedom of expression,'' he added. ``The Member States must transpose 
the Directive within three years, but I sincerely hope that they will 
take the necessary measures without waiting for the deadline to expire 
so as to encourage the investment required for the Information Society 
to become a reality.''
<p>
The Directive will establish a clear and stable regulatory framework
necessary to guarantee free movement of personal data, while leaving
individual EU countries room for manoeuvre in the way the Directive is
implemented. Free movement of data is particularly important for all 
services with a large customer base and depending on processing personal 
data, such as distance selling and financial services. In practice, banks 
and insurance companies process large quantities of personal data inter 
alia on such highly sensitive issues as credit ratings and credit-
worthiness. If each Member State had its own set of rules on data 
protection, for example on how data subjects could verify the information 
held on them, cross-border provision of services, notably over the 
information superhighways, would be virtually impossible and this 
extremely valuable new market opportunity would be lost.
<p>
The Directive aims to narrow divergences between national data protection
laws to the extent necessary to remove obstacles to the free movement of
personal data within the EU. As a result, any person whose data are 
processed in the Community will be afforded an equivalent level of 
protection of his rights, in particular his right to privacy, irrespective
of the Member State where the processing is carried out.
<p>
Until now, differences between national data protection laws have resulted
in obstacles to transfers of personal data between Member States, even 
when these States have ratified the 1981 Council of Europe Convention on 
personal data protection. This has been a particular problem, for example, 
for multinational companies wishing to transfer data concerning their 
employees between their operations in different Member States.
<p>
Such obstacles to data transfers could seriously impede the future growth
of Information Society services. As the Bangemann Group report to the 
Corfu European Council remarked: ``Without the legal security of a Union-
wide approach, lack of consumer confidence will certainly undermine the 
rapid development of the information society.'' As a result, the Corfu 
European Council called for the rapid adoption of the data protection 
Directive.
<p>
To prevent abuses of personal data and ensure that data subjects are
informed of the existence of processing operations, the Directive lays 
down common rules, to be observed by those who collect, hold or transmit 
personal data as part of their economic or administrative activities or in
the course of the activities of their association. In particular, there 
is an obligation to collect data only for specified, explicit and 
legitimate purposes, and to be held only if it is relevant, accurate and 
up-to-date.
<p>
The Directive also establishes the principle of fairness, so that
collection of data should be as transparent as possible, giving 
individuals the option of whether they provide the information or not. 
Moreover, individuals will be entitled to be informed at least about the 
identity of the organisation intending to process data about them and 
the main purposes of such processing. That said, the Directive applies 
different rules according to whether information can be easily provided 
in the normal course of business activities or whether the data has been 
collected by third parties. In the latter case, there is an exemption 
where the obligation to provide information is impossible or involves 
disproportionate effort.
<p>
The Directive requires all data processing to have a proper legal basis.
The six legal grounds defined in the Directive are consent, contract, 
legal obligation, vital interest of the data subject or the balance 
between the legitimate interests of the people controlling the data and 
the people on whom data is held (i.e. data subjects). This balance gives 
Member States room for manoeuvre in their implementation and application 
of the Directive.
<p>
Under the Directive, data subjects are granted a number of important
rights including the right of access to that data, the right to know where
the data originated (if such information is available), the right to have
inaccurate data rectified, a right of recourse in the event of unlawful
processing and the right to withhold permission to use their data in 
certain circumstances (for example, individuals will have the right to 
opt-out free of charge from being sent direct marketing material, 
without providing any specific reason).
<p>
In the case of sensitive data, such as an individual's ethnic or racial
origin, political or religious beliefs, trade union membership or data
concerning health or sexual life, the Directive establishes that it can
only be processed with the explicit consent of the individual, except in 
specific cases such as where there is an important public interest (e.g. 
for medical or scientific research), where alternative safeguards have to 
be established.
<p>
As the flexibility of the Directive means that some differences between
national data protection regimes may persist, the Directive lays down the
principle that the law of the Member State where a data processor is
established applies in cases where data is transferred between Member 
States.
<p>
The Directive also establishes arrangements for monitoring by independent
data supervisory authorities, where necessary acting in tandem with each
other.
<p>
In the specific case of personal data used exclusively for journalistic,
artistic or literary purposes, the Directive requires Member States to 
ensure appropriate exemptions and derogations exist which strike a balance
between guaranteeing freedom of expression while protecting the 
individual's right to privacy.
<p>
For cases where data is transferred to non-EU countries, the Directive
includes provisions to prevent the EU rules from being circumvented. The
basic rule is that the non-EU country receiving the data should ensure an
adequate level of protection, although a practical system of exemptions 
and special conditions also applies. The advantage for non-EU countries 
who can provide adequate protection is that the free flow of data from all
15 EU states will henceforth be assured, whereas up to now each state has
decided on such questions separately.
<p>
For their part, the Council and the Commission have made it clear that
they consider that the European Union institutions and bodies should be
subject to the same protection principles as those laid down in the
Directive.

<li> From Martin David, Dept. of Information Industries, Adelaide:
A new joint Australian/New Zealand standards publication is due
to be issued on 5 November 1996.
<p>
AS/NZS 4444:1996 - "Information Security Management"
<p>
This new Australian/New Zealand standard proposes a set of
recommended requirements, procedures and controls for information
systems design, implementation and operation to safeguard
information resources of organizations from external and internal
security threats, either accidental or intended.  This Joint
Standard includes a comprehensive list of terms relating to
information security.  While it is based on BS 7799, it has been
enhanced and includes appendices with Australian and New Zealand
legislation as well as guidelines and principles from the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).<br>
Retail: Approx AUD 60-00.
<p>
In addition, the following report will also be issued.
<p>
SAA MP75-1996 -- "Strategies for the Implementation of a
Public Key Authentication Framework (PKAF) in Australia"
<p>
Digital signatures are touted to be the solution for true
electronic commerce for authentication purposes. The establishment
of the proposed framework, PKAF, will provide the framework within
which digital signature solutions can cooperatively function.
Without a mechanism for interoperation between proprietary digital
signature schemes, business could be forced to support a variety of
schemes to be able to conduct business with different business
partners.  By creating a PKAF, the issue of who to trust is made
redundant as the signatures are issued under the one framework with
minimum standards of policies and procedures.

<li> Simson Garfinkel and Eugene Spafford, <i>Practical UNIX and Internet Security, Second Edition</i> O'Reilly & Associates, Inc., 1996
 1004 pages.  ISBN: 1-56592-148-8.  $39.95.  Review by Peter Neumann
(from RISKS 17 May):
This book is an extraordinarily successful effort to cram into a mere
thousand pages (971+xxix+ORAads) almost everything you need to know about
Unix and Internet security.  It is a complete rewrite of the First Edition
of 1991, and contains much new material.  In terms of pages per dollar or
cents per page, or much more important, the amount of money it can save you
by keeping you away from a horrendous array of potential security problems,
it is an incredible bargain.  This is a keeper -- at least until the Third
Edition comes out, perhaps in 2001.  By then, the authors will be able to
write much more definitively about Java and web browsers, which are treated
only lightly in the Second Edition.  (Too much happening, too fast?)
Everything else, however, seems well covered and very nicely written.  This
is a very readable and very useful book, and deserves to be looked at by all
of you.

The goal of this document is to demonstrate a method for coherently
integrating the evidence that a computing system satisfies its
critical requirements.  A <EM>critical requirement</EM> is any
requirement that, if not satisfied, could result in catastrophic
behavior such as loss of life or the unauthorized disclosure of
classified information.  The method we use is particularly
appropriate for systems that require high assurance of such critical
requirements.

The evidence that a system satisfies its critical requirements is
typically assessed by an independent certification team during the
accreditation phase of the system's development cycle.  The previous
development of a high assurance network security device, the ECA
[<A HREF="node155.html#Payne94">25</A>], yielded assurance evidence that was not very
convincing to the certifiers, even though the developers were
confident that the ECA conformed to its security requirements.  The
primary problems were that the ECA documentation provided (1)
inadequate guidance on how to piece the evidence together into a
convincing assurance argument, and (2) inadequate assurance that the
evidence gathered was relevant to the ECA implementation.  This made
it difficult for the certifiers to identify potential problems in the
implementation.
<P>
The ECA development experience taught us that, with respect to
independent certification, the presentation of this evidence is at
least as important as the kind of evidence gathered.  The evidence
should be presented as a coherent and integrated whole, which we call
the assurance argument.  Documenting a convincing assurance argument
is complicated by several factors.  First, non-trivial systems usually
require the use of many different methods, both formal and informal,
during the development process, e.g., for requirements analysis,
design simulation and implementation.  Disparate notations and
methodological paradigms threaten the coherence of the assurance
argument and put its certification at risk.  Second, many aspects of
an assurance argument may not be easily formalized, e.g., design
decisions, strategies and assumptions.  The analysis of these aspects
are necessarily more subjective than those aspects that are
formalized.  Finally, although formal methods are more precise, they
can also be less intuitive than informal methods.  The documentation
must explain and motivate the formalisms used.

<P>
Literate programming methods and tools [<A HREF="node155.html#Knuth84">11</A>] provide a foundation for
solving the problems associated with documenting and managing a
convincing assurance argument.  The concept of literate programming is
simple:
<BLOCKQUOTE> A traditional computer program
consists of a text file containing program code.  Scattered in amongst
the program code are comments which describe the various parts of the
code.
<P>
In literate programming the emphasis is reversed.  Instead of writing
code containing documentation, the literate programmer writes
documentation containing code.  No longer does the English commentary
injected into a program have to be hidden in comment delimiters at the
top of the file, or under procedure headings, or at the end of lines.
Instead, it is wrenched into the daylight and made the main focus.
The ``program'' then becomes primarily a document directed at humans,
with the code being herded between ``code delimiters'' from where it
can be extracted and shuffled out sideways to the language system by
literate programming tools.
<P>
The effect of this simple shift of emphasis can be so profound as to
change one's whole approach to programming.  Under the literate
programming paradigm, the central activity of programming becomes that
of conveying meaning to other intelligent beings rather than merely
convincing the computer to behave in a particular way.  It is the
difference between performing and exposing a magic trick.
[<A HREF="node155.html#Williams92">30</A>]
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
We extend the use of literate programming beyond traditional
programming to encompass the specification and verification process as
well.  The application that we choose to demonstrate this approach, an
RS-232 character repeater, was originally posed as a non-trivial,
security-relevant example on which to determine the feasibility of
formal methods [<A HREF="node155.html#Landwehr89">15</A>].  Our use of literate programming
techniques (1) demonstrates how a formal assurance argument can be
presented in a clear and intuitive manner and (2) ensures that the
documentation of the argument is consistent with the actual
specification, implementation, and proof.  This document was written
using literate programming techniques and tools and is itself a
literate program.
<P>
The refinement of the repeater addresses many important issues that
commonly arise in the development of more complex hardware/software
systems.  We analyze very abstract requirements of the repeater at the
top level.  We specify and verify both a logical design and a physical
design of the repeater.  We deal directly with concurrency in
both the logical and physical designs.  This approach required
significant effort, as is evidenced by the length and complexity of
this document.  Nevertheless, by addressing these issues we
demonstrate the potential scalability of the method.  We expect this
document will provide a model for developing assurance arguments for
full-scale composite systems.

<P>
This document contains four parts.  Part&nbsp;<A HREF="node8.html#TheRepeaterProblem">i</A>
describes the repeater problem and solution strategy; we adopt CSP
[<A HREF="node155.html#Hoarecsp85">9</A>] as the computational framework and casts the repeater
critical requirements in terms of this model.  Part&nbsp;<A HREF="node49.html#TheRepeaterLogicalDesign">ii</A> describes the repeater logical design, specification,
and verification using the EVES interactive proof system
[<A HREF="node155.html#Kromodimoeljo93">13</A>].  Part&nbsp;<A HREF="node108.html#TheRepeaterPhysicalDesign">iii</A>
describes the physical implementation of this design and the
verification that the implementation conforms to the design
constraints using the Failures Divergence Refinement (FDR) model
checker [<A HREF="node155.html#Roscoe94">26</A>].  Part&nbsp;<A HREF="node140.html#SupportingDefinitions">iv</A> defines
concepts that are used in the first three parts.  This part presents a
brief description of EVES library units that comprise the EVES and CSP
background theory and repeater application modules.
<P>
Part&nbsp;<A HREF="node8.html#TheRepeaterProblem">i</A> contains three chapters.
Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node9.html#InformalProblemStatementandSolutionStrategy">2</A>
informally describes the repeater problem and solution.
Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node18.html#NotationOverview">3</A> presents an overview of the notation
used to specify, verify, and implement the repeater and the notation
used to document the repeater assurance argument.  This chapter
provides enough detail of the notations used for a fairly thorough
overview of the assurance argument.  It is organized for ease of
reference with much of the relevant notation summarized in tables in
the appendices.  Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node18.html#NotationOverview">3</A> also provides
pointers to relevant documentation (user manuals, tutorials, etc.) for
readers interested in a deeper understanding of the repeater assurance
argument.  Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node30.html#CriticalRequirementsSpecification">4</A> refines
the critical requirements for the repeater based on the assumptions of
the CSP model.  A subset of these requirements expressible as CSP
trace specifications are formalized in the EVES syntax.
Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node30.html#CriticalRequirementsSpecification">4</A> forms the foundation
for the rest of the assurance argument.  The argument evolves as the
repeater is refined using the formal techniques where possible and
informal techniques where necessary to ensure full coverage of the
critical requirements.
<P>
Part&nbsp;<A HREF="node49.html#TheRepeaterLogicalDesign">ii</A> contains three chapters.
Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node50.html#RepeaterLogicalArchitecture">5</A> specifies the repeater
logical architecture as the concurrent composition of two components.
It decomposes the critical requirements described in
Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node30.html#CriticalRequirementsSpecification">4</A> accordingly and
justifies the integrity of the decomposition using EVES for the formal
aspects of the argument.  Chapters &nbsp;<A HREF="node78.html#GetComponentRefinement">6</A> and &nbsp;<A HREF="node95.html#PutComponentRefinement">7</A> present
the design for each component and verify that the design satisfies the
derived requirements, again using EVES as appropriate.
<P>
Part&nbsp;<A HREF="node108.html#TheRepeaterPhysicalDesign">iii</A> contains two chapters.
Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node109.html#RepeaterPhysicalArchitecture">8</A> recasts the repeater
design specified in Part&nbsp;<A HREF="node49.html#TheRepeaterLogicalDesign">ii</A> in the FDR
syntax.  Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node119.html#RepeaterDetailedPhysicalDesign">9</A> implements
this design and verifies, using FDR as appropriate, that the
implementation conforms to the requirements of the design.  This
process generates a set of critical requirements that must be
satisfied by any further refinement.  Although this is the extent
of the repeater refinement in this document, this specification is
consistent with the repeater specified in [<A HREF="node155.html#Auletta93">1</A>], from which

Part&nbsp;<A HREF="node140.html#SupportingDefinitions">iv</A> contains four chapters describing,
respectively, a theory for reasoning about character sequences, a
module for representing character sequences as buffers, an
interface to an abstract base machine providing CSP-like primitives,
and an outline of the library units that comprise the repeater
specification.

The RS-232 character repeater, henceforth referred to simply
as the repeater, relays all characters of correct parity until it
overflows.  More specifically, the repeater has an input data line, an
output data line, and an error port, as shown in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node9.html#externalview">2.1</A>, that can operate at a range of speeds.
Characters (each consisting of a sequence of <TT>K</TT> bits) received from
the input data line are transmitted at the output data line, possibly
after some delay.  All characters of correct parity (assume even
parity coding) received by the repeater are stored, until
transmission, in an internal buffer that can grow to a maximum size
of <TT>N&#;`\>0</TT> <TT>K</TT>-bit characters.  Characters of odd parity are not
retransmitted and cause an error to be signaled on the error port.  If
the buffer overflows (grows to a size greater than <TT>N</TT> characters), an
error is signaled on the error port, nothing more is accepted, all
characters in the buffer received prior to the character causing the
error condition are transmitted, and the repeater halts.

Information security is increasingly recognized as a property of
an information system as a whole, rather than a property of its
components [<A HREF="node155.html#Young91">31</A>]. This raises the question as to why a low-level
device like a character repeater was viewed as security-relevant by
the originators of the problem.  Typically as one focuses on the
requirements of smaller and smaller components of a system, those
requirements become less and less identifiable as security-relevant.
Nevertheless, certain commonly reusable components, such as a memory
management unit, have features that are generally useful in the
construction of secure systems [<A HREF="node155.html#LandCarr84">14</A>]. This is true as well for
the repeater.
<P>
Confidentiality and integrity of information are important concerns
for building secure systems.  The primary concern for the repeater is
the integrity of the data it processes, i.e., ensuring the data is not
corrupted in some way.  The first critical requirement demands that
the characters received by the repeater are transmitted without
change.  Enforcing a strong notion of integrity might require
using an error-correcting code; that is, however, beyond the scope of this
repeater design.
<BLOCKQUOTE> <B>Transmit Characters Until Overflow</B> -- Exactly those
characters of even parity received by the repeater prior to the
reception of the character causing an overflow are transmitted,
<TT>K</TT>-bit character by <TT>K</TT>-bit character.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The repeater must also be concerned with ensuring that no new,
possibly classified, information gets inserted into the character
stream.  The second and third critical requirements address which
characters get transmitted and their ordering.  Preserving the order
of characters is necessary both to ensure that no sensitive
information is encoded in a re-ordering (confidentiality) and to
ensure that the data goes out as it came in (integrity).
<BLOCKQUOTE> <B>Transmit No Spurious Characters</B> -- Only received characters are
transmitted.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <B>Preserve Order</B> -- Characters are transmitted in the
order in which they were received.

The CSP language [<A HREF="node155.html#Hoarecsp85">9</A>] forms the basis for the specification
of the repeater and the verification that it satisfies its critical
requirements.  The EVES Verification System
[<A HREF="node155.html#Craigen91b">5</A>, <A HREF="node155.html#Kromodimoeljo93">13</A>] and the FDR model checker
[<A HREF="node155.html#FDR94">6</A>, <A HREF="node155.html#Roscoe94">26</A>] provide mechanical assistance for constructing
and verifying the CSP specifications.  EVES is a general purpose
interactive verification system that can be used to prove
mathematically that CSP descriptions conform to trace specifications.
NRL extended an existing CSP theory [<A HREF="node155.html#Pase92">24</A>, <A HREF="node155.html#Kromodimoeljo92">12</A>] to
support such verifications [<A HREF="node155.html#MooreEVES94">21</A>].  FDR is a CSP model
checker that automatically verifies (through an exhaustive state space
analysis) that a CSP process implementation properly refines a CSP
process specification.

<STRONG>Figure 2.2:</STRONG> Repeater Assurance Argument<BR>
<P>
<P>
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node11.html#argument">2.2</A> illustrates our approach for constructing the
assurance argument for the repeater CSP process implementation.
Slanted arrows indicate a <I>refinement</I> of a specification to a
more detailed specification or implementation; vertical arrows
indicate a <I>translation</I> of a specification from one semantic
domain to another semantic domain at a comparable specification level.
Dashed arrows indicate a refinement/translation that is <I>
informal</I>; solid arrows indicate a refinement that uses a combination
of <I>informal</I> and <I>formal</I> techniques.  The increase in width of the
argument from top to bottom illustrates additional detail that is
specified at the lower levels.  Other work describes the synthesis of
a gate-level hardware description from the repeater CSP physical design
using VHDL synthesis tools [<A HREF="node155.html#Auletta93">1</A>].
<P>
The CSP computational paradigm makes a number of assumptions about the
environment and implementation of CSP processes.  Since we use this
model to derive the repeater physical design, these assumptions result
in critical requirements in addition to those described in the
previous section.  These additional critical requirements are not
expressible in terms of the CSP model and, thus, must be verified
informally.  Tracing all the critical
requirements through the levels of repeater refinement is a key aspect
of the assurance argument that is not explicit in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node11.html#argument">2.2</A>.

<STRONG>Figure 2.3:</STRONG> Repeater Requirements Tracability<BR>
<P>
<P>
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node11.html#reqstrace">2.3</A> illustrates the trace of requirements through
the repeater logical and physical designs to the verification that
those designs satisfy their derived requirements.  An arrow from <I>A</I>
to <I>B</I> means that <I>A</I> contributes to the derivation of <I>B</I>.  Critical
requirements for the repeater's physical architecture derive both from
the top-level critical requirements and the fact that the detailed
logical design satisfies the top-level critical requirements.  This
latter fact simplifies the physical architecture requirements since we
need to show only that the physical design conforms to the logical
design to guarantee that the requirements of Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node10.html#CriticalRequirements">2.1</A> hold.  A set of requirements for further refinement of
the repeater are generated out of the process of refining the physical
architecture.
<P>
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node11.html#reqstrace">2.3</A> provides part and chapter numbers indicating
where in this document the primary elements of the requirements trace
reside.  Critical requirements are classified as either assumptions or
assertions.  <EM>Assumptions</EM> are those requirements that are
necessary to satisfy the requirements of Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node10.html#CriticalRequirements">2.1</A>, but that can only be enforced by the repeater's
environment.  <EM>Assertions</EM> are those critical requirements that
can be enforced by the repeater itself.  <EM>Formal</EM>
assumptions/assertions can be stated in the CSP model; <EM>informal</EM>
assumptions/assertions are beyond the expressive power of the CSP
model and are stated in English.  We identify new or derived
assumptions and assertions ``in-line'' during the presentation of a
specification and summarize them near the end of the chapter in which
they are identified.  We use a numbering scheme similar to the
chapter/section numbering scheme so that critical requirements can
easily be traced back to their origin, e.g., ``Assert 3.2'' represents
the second derived assertion that originated from assertion 3.
<P>
Refinement of the repeater design requires justification.  Each
chapter representing such a refinement concludes with a section that
justifies the refinement.  Each justification relies on a combination
of formal and informal arguments.  Formal arguments are used to justify
that a repeater design conforms to its formal assertions; informal
arguments are used to justify that a repeater design conforms to its
informal assertions.  We use narrative text to motivate and outline
the formal
arguments, but we rely on the mechanical tools to convince the reader
that the details of the formal argument are correct.
<P>
Formal and informal arguments use identical notation to identify
exactly what is to be proven and what facts are needed in the proof.
The expression <TT>c</TT> using <TT>a1,a2,...,an</TT> describes a theorem in
which <TT>a1</TT> through <TT>an</TT> are assumptions and <TT>c</TT> is the
conclusion.  This expression can be read ``<TT>c</TT> follows from the
assumptions <TT>a1</TT> through <TT>an</TT>.''  The justification of each
theorem immediately follows the sequent representing the theorem.
Each argument ends with symbol .  Critical requirements that
do not change through the decomposition are signified by the name of
the requirement followed by the phrase ``No change.''
<P>
The rest of this section provides an overview of the tools that we use
to specify and document the repeater assurance argument, with pointers
to relevant documentation for a more thorough treatment.

The question arises why we use both interactive proof and model
checking technology to construct the repeater argument.  The use of
interactive mathematical proof as a means of gaining assurance that an
implementation conforms to its critical requirements is a (human)
labor intensive process.  Model checking can provide a comparable
level of assurance for portions of a system verification at a
substantial savings in time and human labor.  Unfortunately, model
checking currently applies only to the verification of relatively
low-level requirements.  FDR, for example, is used to verify that an
implementation conforms to a CSP process specification.  We need the
EVES interactive prover to verify that the CSP process specification
conforms to a more intuitive statement of the critical
requirements.

The repeater problem statement, described in the introduction to this
chapter, requires the repeater to receive and transmit bits at a range
of speed.  Support for asynchronous input and output suggests that we
use a language suited to reasoning about asynchronously communicating
components.  Unfortunately, few mechanical tools directly support
formal reasoning about such systems.  The Gypsy Verification
Environment [<A HREF="node155.html#Good89">8</A>] is useful for the verification of a variety
of concurrent applications, but limits on the form of the
specification and implementation of concurrent programs make it
awkward to use for the repeater.  At this writing, it is difficult,
for example to specify in Gypsy program exit conditions of the form
``at the time a message is received over channel A, the history of
channel B satisfies property P.''
<P>
Process algebras alleviate such problems by interleaving the
individual channel histories in the order in which communications take
place.  Since the repeater is naturally described as a set of
communicating processes and the repeater requirements are naturally
stated as restrictions on traces of communication events, the process
algebraic approach is ideal.  While there are many process algebras
documented in the literature, most are related in some way to one of
the two early process algebras: CSP and CCS [<A HREF="node155.html#Milner89">17</A>].  The
tools that have been developed to aid reasoning about CSP and CCS are
roughly comparable.  However, we choose to use CSP because we had
ready access to the CSP tools and we had experience using CSP to
specify and verify security properties for a number of applications.
Furthermore, the CSP Traces Refinement model is relatively easy to
understand, allowing a clear exposition of the assurance argument.
<P>
Our solution strategy balances the
assurance gained with the development cost incurred (including both
human resources used and time to completion).  A number of tools exist
that permit users to graphically depict the simulation of
communicating processes, e.g., LOTOS [<A HREF="node155.html#Eijk89">29</A>], but we decided to
limit the scope of our effort to techniques complementary to testing
in the verification process.  This left interactive mathematical proof
and model checking.
<P>
The choice of model checker is critical to achieving the goal of
automating as much of the verification process as possible.  FDR and
the Concurrency Workbench [<A HREF="node155.html#Cleaveland90">3</A>] were the leading model
checker candidates.  While these tools are roughly equivalent in terms
of functionality, FDR was chosen for the repeater refinement because
of its basis in CSP, rather than CCS, and it's production-quality
environment.
<P>
Verifying more intuitive properties of CSP specifications requires interactive
proof.  A number of interactive proof assistants in addition to EVES
have been extended to support reasoning about CSP.  Previous work at
NRL encoded a subset of the CSP Traces Refinement model in the logic
of EHDM [<A HREF="node155.html#Moore90">20</A>]; work in the UK encoded the Failure-Divergences
Model in the logic of HOL [<A HREF="node155.html#Camerilli90">2</A>].  EVES was chosen for a
number of reasons.  Only EVES and HOL permit user-defined syntax of
application theories, which is helpful for reasoning in a
user-friendly CSP syntax.  Only EVES and EHDM permit verification of actual
software programs, which is important for future work involving
literate assurance arguments about code.  In the end, EVES was chosen
because of its support for automating, rather than merely mechanizing,
the reasoning process.  The advent of other tools, e.g., PVS
[<A HREF="node155.html#Owre92">23</A>], may require a re-evaluation of this choice for future
efforts.

The solution that we have proposed to the repeater problem
stresses the importance of specifying the critical requirements in an
intuitive manner while automating as much of the verification process
as possible.  Unfortunately, requirements stated to promote human
understanding are usually not the easiest to verify automatically.
This is exemplified by the low level requirements specification
languages of existing model checkers.  Our solution requires combining
in a coherent manner the three tools we described in the last chapter:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><STRONG> <IMG WIDTH=6 HEIGHT=6 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18042" SRC="img6.gif"  > </STRONG>
<DD> CSP which provides a concise notation and theory, but,
by itself, provides no mechanical support;
<P>
<DT><STRONG> <IMG WIDTH=6 HEIGHT=6 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18042" SRC="img6.gif"  > </STRONG>
<DD> EVES which provides the ability to prove arbitrary
properties, but, by itself, only provides a limited potential for
automation; and
<P>
<DT><STRONG> <IMG WIDTH=6 HEIGHT=6 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18042" SRC="img6.gif"  > </STRONG>
<DD> FDR which provides complete automation,
but, by itself,
does not support specifying properties in an intuitively appealing
manner.
<P>
 </DL>
<P>
Addressing the goals of our solution through the combined use of CSP,
EVES and FDR comes at a cost.  Each of these tools has its own set of
notational conventions that often conflict.  Our goal in the
presentation of the repeater assurance argument is to use a notation
that eases the understanding of the argument to the lowest levels of
abstraction.  Fortunately, EVES permits user-defined syntax for
application theories, so that a CSP-like syntax for specifying and
reasoning about CSP can be defined.  However, EVES restricts
user-defined syntax to certain sequences of ASCII character symbols;
these restrictions do not permit full conformance with the syntax for
CSP in [<A HREF="node155.html#Hoarecsp85">9</A>] or the ASCII version of CSP on which FDR is
based.
<P>
We choose a syntax for CSP that is as close as possible to FDR's CSP
syntax and that we believe promotes readability of the repeater
assurance argument.  We present this syntax in Appendix&nbsp;<A HREF="node156.html#CSPNotationOverview">A</A>; the index at the end of the document identifies
the page number on which specific operators are described.
Appendix&nbsp;<A HREF="node165.html#NotationalVariations">B</A> describes variations on the
syntax necessary for processing by the mechanical tools.  We
explicitly choose not to use a pretty (LaTeX) version of the syntax in
the narrative descriptions, e.g., one which follows more closely the
notation described in [<A HREF="node155.html#Hoarecsp85">9</A>], because we
feel this would tend to confuse rather than clarify the
ASCII-restricted SVerdi specifications.  We present enough detail
about the relatively small subset of CSP used that additional reading
on CSP is probably not necessary.  For readers already familiar with
CSP or readers that desire additional background,
Appendix&nbsp;<A HREF="node166.html#ComparisonwithHoaresCSP">C</A> provides a
summary of the correspondence between the syntax of Hoare's CSP and
the syntax we have adopted.
<P>
The rest of this section uses the notation of Appendix&nbsp;<A HREF="node156.html#CSPNotationOverview">A</A> to describe in more detail the CSP specification
paradigm and the infrastructure provided by EVES and FDR to specify
and mechanically verify properties about CSP descriptions.  We also
describe the notational conventions of the literate programming tool
that we are using to document and manage the assurance argument.  One
need not memorize the notation presented at first reading.  Only a
small subset of the CSP and EVES notation is needed for the next
chapter.  Part&nbsp;<A HREF="node49.html#TheRepeaterLogicalDesign">ii</A> increasingly relies
on a more in-depth understanding of the CSP and EVES notation.  We do
not use the FDR notation until Part&nbsp;<A HREF="node108.html#TheRepeaterPhysicalDesign">iii</A>.  An understanding of FunndelWeb notation is required
uniformly through the document.  We suggest a cursory review of the
notation to start with followed by a more in-depth study as the need
arises.
<P>
While progressing through the assurance argument, we hope the reader
keeps in mind Hoare's views on learning a new notation:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Notations are a frequent complaint. ... If it is any
consolation, this should be the least of your worries.  After learning
the script, you must learn the grammar and the vocabulary, and after
that you must master the idiom and style, and after that you must
develop fluency in the use of the language to express your own ideas.
All this requires study and exercise and time, and cannot be hurried.
So it is with mathematics.  The symbols may initially appear to be a
serious hurdle; but the real problem is to understand the meaning and
properties of the symbols and how they may and may not be manipulated,
and to gain fluency in using them to express new problems, solutions,
and proofs.  Finally, you will cultivate an appreciation of
mathematical elegance and style.  By that time, the symbols will be
invisible; you will see straight through them to what they mean.

The CSP language permits describing systems as networks of
communicating processes.  A CSP process is an entity that communicates
with its environment through named communication channels.  The Traces
Refinement
model of CSP characterizes a process according to its alphabet and set
of traces.  The alphabet of a process <I>P</I>, denoted  <IMG WIDTH=62 HEIGHT=23 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18050" SRC="img45.gif"  > ,
specifies all communication events relevant to characterizing <I>P</I>.  A
communication event is described by a pair <I>c</I>.<I>m</I>; the alphabet of
process <I>P</I> contains <I>c</I>.<I>m</I> if and only if <I>P</I> is permitted to
communicate message <I>m</I> over channel <I>c</I>.  The trace of a process is an
observation of its execution.  It consists of a finite sequence of
events in which the process has engaged at some moment of time.  The
set of all traces of a process <I>P</I> is denoted  <IMG WIDTH=71 HEIGHT=11 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18068" SRC="img8.gif"  > .
<P>
The CSP notation allows the description of processes using a variety
of process constructors.  The CSP subset used in this document
contains nine primary process constructors, <code>STOP</code>, <code>SKIP</code>,
the prefix constructor `` <IMG WIDTH=16 HEIGHT=8 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18070" SRC="img9.gif"  > '', the choice constructor
`` <IMG WIDTH=11 HEIGHT=22 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18072" SRC="img10.gif"  > '', the conditional constructor `` <IMG WIDTH=154 HEIGHT=10 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18074" SRC="img11.gif"  > '', the sequential constructor `` <IMG WIDTH=3 HEIGHT=16 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18076" SRC="img12.gif"  > '', the recursion
constructor `` <IMG WIDTH=7 HEIGHT=5 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18078" SRC="img13.gif"  > '', the concurrent constructor `` <IMG WIDTH=11 HEIGHT=22 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18080" SRC="img89.gif"  > '',
and the compose constructor `` <IMG WIDTH=19 HEIGHT=22 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18082" SRC="img51.gif"  > ''.   <IMG WIDTH=33 HEIGHT=10 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18084" SRC="img16.gif"  >  is the process with
alphabet <I>A</I> that never engages in any events of <I>A</I>; it describes the
behavior of a broken process.  The only trace of  <IMG WIDTH=33 HEIGHT=10 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18090" SRC="img16.gif"  >  is the
empty trace.   <IMG WIDTH=33 HEIGHT=10 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18092" SRC="img18.gif"  >  is the process with alphabet <I>A</I>, which does
nothing but terminate successfully; it describes the behavior of a
process that has successfully finished its job. To distinguish  <IMG WIDTH=33 HEIGHT=10 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18096" SRC="img16.gif"  >  and  <IMG WIDTH=33 HEIGHT=10 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18098" SRC="img18.gif"  >  the event  <IMG WIDTH=34 HEIGHT=10 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18100" SRC="img70.gif"  >  is used to signify successful
termination.  The only traces of  <IMG WIDTH=33 HEIGHT=10 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18102" SRC="img18.gif"  >  is  <IMG WIDTH=14 HEIGHT=9 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18104" SRC="img23.gif"  >  <code>&gt;.</code>    and  <IMG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=11 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18106" SRC="img24.gif"  > .
<P>
The prefix process `` <IMG WIDTH=44 HEIGHT=11 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18108" SRC="img25.gif"  > '' describes a process that first
behaves like <I>e</I> and then like process <I>P</I>.  The trace of this process
is <I>e</I> tacked onto the front of <I>t</I> where <I>t</I> is the trace of <I>P</I>.
The choice constructor allows the behavior of a process to be
influenced by outside events.  If <I>P</I> and <I>Q</I> are processes and <I>e</I>
and <I>f</I> are events, the process `` <IMG WIDTH=112 HEIGHT=22 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18130" SRC="img26.gif"  > '' behaves like
process <I>P</I> if <I>e</I> is the first event to occur and behaves like
process <I>Q</I> if <I>f</I> is the first event to occur.  This generalizes to a
process `` <IMG WIDTH=85 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18140" SRC="img27.gif"  > '' where <I>B</I> is a non-empty set of events,
<I>x</I> is an arbitrary event from <I>B</I>, and <I>P</I> is a function from events
to processes.  A trace of a choice process
must be a trace of one of the alternatives.  The conditional process
`` <IMG WIDTH=186 HEIGHT=22 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18150" SRC="img28.gif"  > '' is defined as the process <I>P</I> if <I>b</I> is
 <IMG WIDTH=34 HEIGHT=9 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18156" SRC="img29.gif"  > , otherwise <I>Q</I>.  This can be generalized to allow any number
of conditional branches in the natural way.  The trace of a
conditional process is simply the trace of the process specified by
the value of the conditional expressions.
<P>
The sequential composition of processes, `` <IMG WIDTH=31 HEIGHT=22 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18160" SRC="img30.gif"  > '', describes a
process that acts like the successful termination of <I>P</I> followed by
<I>Q</I>. If <I>P</I> does not terminate successfully then <I>Q</I> does not start.
The trace of this process is a trace of <I>P</I> and, if this trace ends
with the successful termination event, that event is replaced by a
trace of <I>Q</I>.  A process successfully terminates only if the process
terminates on a <code>SKIP</code> process.  The recursive process `` <IMG WIDTH=44 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18174" SRC="img31.gif"  > '' describes the process <I>X</I> that is the solution, i.e., fixed
point, of the equation  <IMG WIDTH=44 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18178" SRC="img31.gif"  > .
<P>
 <IMG WIDTH=97 HEIGHT=22 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18180" SRC="img97.gif"  >  describes a process executing process <I>P</I> concurrently
with process <I>Q</I> while synchronizing on events in <I>X</I>.  Two processes
synchronize on an event if and only if they engage in that event
simultaneously.  A commonly used abbreviation,  <IMG WIDTH=49 HEIGHT=22 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18188" SRC="img48.gif"  >  describes a
process executing process <I>P</I> concurrently with process <I>Q</I> with
synchronization on those events that occur in both  <IMG WIDTH=62 HEIGHT=23 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18194" SRC="img45.gif"  >  and
 <IMG WIDTH=62 HEIGHT=23 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18196" SRC="img36.gif"  > .  Events occurring in  <IMG WIDTH=62 HEIGHT=23 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18198" SRC="img45.gif"  >  but not  <IMG WIDTH=62 HEIGHT=23 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18200" SRC="img36.gif"  >  may
be engaged in by <I>P</I> independently of <I>Q</I>.  While the concurrency
constructor is an operation on two processes, either of the two
processes may itself be a concurrent process.  This operator therefore
allows the description of arbitrary networks of processes.
<P>
Processes executing concurrently communicate through channels.   <IMG WIDTH=42 HEIGHT=12 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18206" SRC="img39.gif"  >  denotes the output of message <I>m</I> on channel <I>C</I>;  <IMG WIDTH=37 HEIGHT=12 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18212" SRC="img40.gif"  >  denotes
the input of
value for <I>x</I> on channel <I>C</I>.  These operations are communication events
defined by
<P> <IMG WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=40 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="eqnarray484" SRC="img41.gif"  > <P>
Although the CSP notation distinguishes between
the input and output of values over channels, the Traces Refinement model uses
only the generic dot notation, <I>C</I>.<I>m</I>, to represent communications over
channels.  For example, the traces of the output process  <IMG WIDTH=65 HEIGHT=11 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18220" SRC="img42.gif"  > 
are simply the traces of  <IMG WIDTH=67 HEIGHT=12 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18222" SRC="img43.gif"  > .
<P>
A communication of message <I>m</I> over <I>C</I> can occur between two processes
running in parallel if and only if both processes have the
communication event <I>C</I>.<I>m</I> in their alphabets and both processes
simultaneously engage in that event.  That is, whenever one process
outputs a value onto the channel, the other process simultaneously
inputs the same value from the channel. This implies
that
<P> <IMG WIDTH=432 HEIGHT=16 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="displaymath18230" SRC="img44.gif"  > <P>
where <I>C</I>.<I>m</I> occurs in  <IMG WIDTH=62 HEIGHT=23 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18234" SRC="img45.gif"  >  and  <IMG WIDTH=87 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18236" SRC="img46.gif"  > . If
only one process in a
network of processes has a communication event in its alphabet, then
that process may communicate over the channel associated with that
event independently of the other processes.  To simplify the theory
involved, Hoare assumes that at most two processes in a network of
processes can access the same communication channel and that
communication over a channel occurs in only one direction [<A HREF="node155.html#Hoarecsp85">9</A>].
If only
one process in the network can access the channel, the channel is said
to be external; if two processes can access the channel, the channel
is said to be internal.  The only way a process can communicate with
another process executing concurrently is by engaging in a
communication event; no shared memory is permitted.
<P>
The alphabet and set of traces of a concurrent process are defined in
terms of its component processes.  The alphabet of a concurrent
process is simply the union of the alphabets of its component
processes.  The set of traces of a concurrent process includes any trace
that, when restricted to one of its component alphabets, forms a trace
for that component.
<P>
The above view of concurrency requires that any trace of a
concurrent process  <IMG WIDTH=49 HEIGHT=22 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18238" SRC="img48.gif"  >  include every event in which <I>P</I> or <I>Q</I>
engage.  The visibility of the communications over internal channels
in the traces of  <IMG WIDTH=49 HEIGHT=22 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18244" SRC="img48.gif"  >  reduces the amount of abstraction possible
during the system design process.  Hierarchical design, a proven
method for managing the complexity of system design and verification,
requires that the requirements of a component be based solely on the
sequence of external communications in which it may engage.  We would
like to be able to hide the internal events and describe requirements
of a process's external interface only.  The CSP hiding operation
`` <IMG WIDTH=47 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18246" SRC="img49.gif"  > '' describes a process <I>P</I> with the events in set <I>A</I>
hidden.  Therefore,  <IMG WIDTH=236 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18252" SRC="img50.gif"  >  describes a concurrent process with all internal event hidden.
For convenience, we define an abbreviation for this process using the
compose operator, denoted  <IMG WIDTH=19 HEIGHT=22 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18254" SRC="img51.gif"  > .   <IMG WIDTH=111 HEIGHT=22 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18256" SRC="img52.gif"  >  is equivalent to the
 <IMG WIDTH=49 HEIGHT=22 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18258" SRC="img48.gif"  >  except that the internal communications are hidden.
The traces and alphabet of a compose process are the
same as for a concurrent process with the internal events deleted.
<P>
The Traces Refinement model of CSP permits specifying safety, i.e., partial
correctness, requirements of non-divergent processes [<A HREF="node155.html#Olderog86">22</A>].
A process <I>P</I> is non-divergent if <I>P</I> contains no unguarded recursion
(i.e., if every recursive call to <I>P</I> is prefixed by some event) and
<I>P</I> cannot engage in an infinite consecutive sequence of hidden
events.<A NAME="tex2html6" HREF="footnode.html#500"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC=".//foot_motif.gif"></A> A
requirement in CSP is viewed as a set of traces.  Process <I>P</I>
satisfies a requirement <I>R</I>, denoted  <IMG WIDTH=58 HEIGHT=12 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18272" SRC="img54.gif"  > , if and only if <I>R</I>
contains every trace that may occur as an observation of <I>P</I>:
<P> <IMG WIDTH=355 HEIGHT=16 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="displaymath18278" SRC="img55.gif"  > <P>
<P>
The above discussion
identifies a number of assumptions that the Traces Refinement
model of CSP makes about the environment and implementation of a CSP
process.  In summary, these are
<BLOCKQUOTE> <B>Shared Channel Communication</B> -- Communication
between concurrent processes (or a process and its environment) can
take place only over channels shared by the alphabets of the
processes.
<P>
        <B>Two-Process Communication</B> -- Communication over a
channel is unidirectional involving exactly two processes - one
process acting as a sender and the other process acting as a receiver.
<P>
        <B>Atomic Communication</B> -- Communication over
a channel is an atomic event.
<P>
        <B>Synchronous Communication</B> -- Communication over
a channel requires synchronous participation of both sender and
receiver.
<P>
        <B>Non-Divergent Processes</B> -- Processes are non-divergent,
i.e., all recursion is guarded and there is no possibility of a
process engaging in an infinite consecutive sequence of hidden events.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The validity of the assurance argument for the repeater developed in this
document depends on the validity of these assumptions for the primitives
of the repeater logical and physical designs.  These assumptions will be
continually refined and interpreted throughout the repeater refinement.

We use SVerdi to write definitions, conjectures, and
proofs.  These entities can be organized using the built-in library
mechanism.  This mechanism provides a foundation from which to encode
the CSP Traces Refinement model in EVES, to specify CSP applications and to
prove that they satisfy their critical (trace) requirements.

SVerdi can be partitioned into the constructs that permit execution in EVES
and those that do not permit execution in EVES.  SVerdi non-executable
definitions are for specification purposes only; they can be stated as
functions in the SVerdi Logic.  The SVerdi Logic is based on the
Predicate Calculus using an ASCII syntax for predicate logic operators
(see Appendix&nbsp;<A HREF="node156.html#CSPNotationOverview">A</A>).
Constants may be defined as functions of zero arguments.  The EVES
initial theory defines all the built-in functions including the
set-theoretic extensions and operators for the pre-defined types.
<P>
User-defined functions in SVerdi have the format
<BLOCKQUOTE> <PRE>function F (p1,p2,...,pn) =
  measure M(p1,p2,...,pn)
  begin
    FDef(p1,p2,...,pn)
  end F;</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The <TT>measure</TT> expression in the above template is required only for
recursive functions as a basis for proof of termination.  The measure
<TT>M</TT> must describe an expression associating natural numbers to
recursive calls that is bounded below by zero and decreases each
recurrence of the function.
The body of a function may be ``stubbed out'' to postpone
its definition until a later time. A simple example is integer exponentiation,
the stub of which might be
<BLOCKQUOTE> <PRE>function exp (base,exponent);</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
and the fully expanded body of which might be
<BLOCKQUOTE> <PRE>function exp (base,exponent) =
  measure exponent
  begin
    if exponent &gt;= 1
    then base * (exponent - 1)
    else 1
  end exp;</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The value of <code>exponent</code>, the measure for this function,
decreases each iteration until it reaches a value
less than 1.
<P>
SVerdi provides a distinct notation called <I>zf functions</I> for constructing
sets.  To define, for example, the sets
<P> <IMG WIDTH=351 HEIGHT=16 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="displaymath18280" SRC="img56.gif"  > <P>
<P> <IMG WIDTH=363 HEIGHT=16 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="displaymath18282" SRC="img57.gif"  > <P>
we define in SVerdi
<BLOCKQUOTE> <PRE>zf function foo (x) =
  begin
    { y in f(x) | P(x,y) }
  end foo;

zf function bar (x) =
  begin
    { g(x,y,z) | y,z in f(x) }
  end bar;</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
One other type of zf function allows you to choose an arbitrary value
that satisfies some expression; for example, the function
<BLOCKQUOTE> <PRE>zf function foobar (x) =
  begin
    y | P(x,y)
  end foobar;</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
chooses a <code>y</code> such that <code>P(x,y)</code> holds, provided that one exists.
No measures are
needed for zf functions since they may not be defined recursively.  These
and other set theoretic operators, which do not require embedding in zf
function definitions, are summarized in Appendix&nbsp;<A HREF="node160.html#SetNotation">A.4</A>.

SVerdi specifications may use the full power of mathematics to
describe the requirements to which a system must conform.  SVerdi
code, on the other hand, must be executable on a physical
machine and, therefore, must conform to the constraints of that
machine.  For example, specifications may use unbounded integers,
whereas any code will be constrained to a subset that is
representable on the base machine chosen.  The executable subset of
SVerdi is strongly typed for representation purposes;  the subset
consists of type declarations, typed function declarations, and
procedure declarations.  SVerdi types include <TT>bool</TT> (Booleans),
<TT>char</TT> (characters), <TT>int</TT> (integers), enumerated types, records
and arrays.
<P>
Typed functions have the format
<BLOCKQUOTE> <PRE>typed function TF (p11,p12,...,p1i : t1,
                   p21,p22,...,p2j : t2,
                   ...,
                   pm1,pm2,...,pmn : tm,) returns t =
  pre P(p11,...,pmn)
  begin
    TFDef(p11,...,pmn)
  end TF;</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
where <TT>t, t1, t2, ..., tm</TT> are pre-declared types and <TT>p11, ..., pmn</TT> are
parameters of the associated types.  The <TT>pre</TT> expression in the
above template is needed only if the function <TT>TF</TT> is not total over
the type space;  in this case, <TT>P(p11,...,pmn)</TT> defines the
restricted domain of the
function.
<P>
SVerdi procedure declarations have the format
<BLOCKQUOTE> <PRE>typed function PR (xvar p11,p12,...,p1i : t1,
                   xvar p21,p22,...,p2j : t2,
                   ...,
                   xvar pm1,pm2,...,pmn : tm) =
  initial I(p11,...,pmn)
  pre P1(p11,...,pmn)
  post P2(p11,...,pmn)
  measure M(p11,...,pmn)
  begin
    PRDef(p11,...,pmn)
  end PR;</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
where <TT>t, t1, t2, ..., tm</TT> are pre-declared types and
<TT>p11, ..., pmn</TT> are
parameters of the associated types.  <TT>xvar</TT> is one of <TT>lvar</TT>,
<TT>pvar</TT>, or <TT>mvar</TT>.  Logical variable, or <TT>lvar</TT>, parameters are
value parameters.  Program variable, or <TT>pvar</TT>, parameters are
variable parameters.  Machine variable, or <TT>mvar</TT>, parameters
provide restricted access to variables of the base machine, e.g.,
physical ports.
Their exact value depends, ultimately,
on linking the program to the specific observables.
<P>
The <TT>initial</TT> expression in procedure declarations gives
names to the initial values of the variables for reference in later
annotations.  The <TT>pre</TT> expression describes the condition that is
assumed to hold on entry to the procedure.  The <TT>post</TT> expression
describes the condition that is guaranteed to hold on exit of the
procedure, if it can be shown that execution of statements
<TT>PRDef(p11,...,pmn)</TT> of the procedure implies that the condition holds.
The <TT>measure</TT> expression is required only for recursively defined
procedures; <TT>M</TT> must describe an expression associating
natural numbers to recursive calls that is bounded below by zero and
decreases each recurrence of the procedure.
<P>
SVerdi statements include assignments, conditionals, procedure calls,
loops and loop exits.  Each loop must have the format
<BLOCKQUOTE> <PRE>loop
  invariant Inv(p11,...,pmn)
  measure m(p11,...,pmn)
  LDef(p11,...,pmn)
end loop;</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
where the <TT>invariant</TT> expression describes a condition that holds at
that point every iteration; the <TT>measure</TT> expression describes an
integer expression that is bounded below by zero and decreases each
iteration of the loop; and <TT>LDef</TT> describes the statements executed
each iteration.

<P>
<A NAME="Conjectures">&#160;</A>
<P>
SVerdi provides several complementary ways to formulate conjectures,
i.e., logical predicates, about SVerdi definitions.  The simplest form
of conjecture is an axiom:
<BLOCKQUOTE> <PRE>axiom A (v1,v2,...,vn) =
  begin
    P(v1,v2,..,vn)
  end A;</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
where <code>P</code> is a predicate stated in terms of the variables
<code>v1</code> through <code>vn</code>.  Although this type of conjecture is
referred to as an
axiom, EVES obligates the developer to prove the predicate submitted.
The EVES prover, which is called NEVER, requires that the axiom
definition be explicitly
assumed (via a <code>use</code> command) in order for the predicate defined by the
axiom to be used in subsequent proofs.
<P>
Three other types of
conjecture definitions - rules, grules, and frules - allow the
developer to direct NEVER to use the predicates defined automatically
when certain conditions are met.  Rules are rewrite rules of the form
<BLOCKQUOTE> <PRE>rule R (v1,v2,...,vn) =
  begin
       C(v1,v2,..,vn)
    -&gt; P(v1,v2,..,vn) = E(v1,v2,..,vn)
  end R;</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
where <code>C</code> is a predicate condition, <code>P</code> is a pattern to be
matched, and E is an expression to be substituted.  If <code>R</code> is in
the EVES database and NEVER encounters the pattern <code>P</code> in the
proof of a formula, then, if condition <code>C</code> can be proven
automatically, expression E is substituted for P in the formula.  If
<code>C</code> is tautologically  <IMG WIDTH=34 HEIGHT=9 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18284" SRC="img29.gif"  > , the definition of a rule
can be simplified as expected.
<P>
A grule is used in the proof of a formula when a subexpression of the
formula matches the trigger expression for the grule.  Grules have the
form
<BLOCKQUOTE> <PRE>grule G (v1,v2,...,vn) =
  begin
       C(v1,v2,..,vn)
    -&gt; P(v1,v2,..,vn)
  end G;</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
where <code>C</code> is a predicate condition, and <code>P</code> is a predicate
containing the trigger expression.  The trigger is the first full
function applied to zero or more distinct free variables when <code>P</code>
is scanned from left to right.  If <code>G</code> is in the EVES database
and NEVER encounters <code>G</code>'s trigger in the proof of a formula
then, if condition <code>C</code> can be proven, predicate <code>P</code> is
assumed.  If <code>C</code> is tautologically  <IMG WIDTH=34 HEIGHT=9 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18286" SRC="img29.gif"  > , the definition of a
grule can be simplified as expected.
<P>
Finally, a frule is used in the proof of a formula when an instance of
its condition becomes  <IMG WIDTH=34 HEIGHT=9 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18288" SRC="img29.gif"  > .  Frules have the form
<BLOCKQUOTE> <PRE>frule F (v1,v2,...,vn) =
  begin
       C(v1,v2,..,vn)
    -&gt; P(v1,v2,..,vn)
  end F;</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
where <code>C</code> and <code>P</code> are predicates.  If <code>F</code> is in the
EVES database and NEVER detects that condition <code>C</code> is satisfied
for some instantiation of <code>v1</code> through <code>vn</code> in the proof of
a formula, then predicate <code>P</code> is assumed.

SVerdi provides commands to interact with NEVER to prove the proof
obligations generated while parsing definitions and conjectures into
the EVES database.  These commands can roughly be classified as to
whether they provide coarse-grained control or fine-grained control
over NEVER.
<P>
Commands providing coarse-grained control include <code>simplify</code>,
<code>rewrite</code>, and <code>reduce</code>.  Simplification uses frules and
grules to transform an expression to one that the system considers to
be simpler.  Rewriting performs simplification and applies any rewrite
rules that match the subexpression being traversed.  Finally, reducing
expands function definitions in addition to simplifying and rewriting
the current formula.  These coarse-grained commands can use a
conjecture or function definition only if it is enabled.  By default
conjectures and definitions are enabled; they may be disabled by
adding the keyword <code>disabled</code> in front of the conjecture or
function definition.  The coarse-grained commands can be incrementally
strengthened/weakened using the <code>with enabled/</code><code>with
disabled</code> modifiers, specifying the definitions and conjectures to be
enabled/disabled during the course of the command execution.
<P>
Commands that provide fine-grained control include commands that allow
definitions and conjectures to be used manually (e.g., <code>use</code>,
<code>invoke</code>,
and <code>apply</code>) and commands that perform
<UL><LI> quantifier manipulation (e.g., <code>instantiate</code> and <code>prenex</code>),<LI> equality reasoning (e.g., <code>equality substitute</code>),<LI> formula rearranging (e.g., <code>rearrange</code> and <code>split</code>), and<LI> case splitting (e.g., <code>cases</code> and <code>next</code>).
</UL>
SVerdi also provides an induction command, <code>induct</code>, which inducts
on a recursive function specified by the user or chosen heuristically
based on calls to recursive functions within the current formula.

SVerdi descriptions can be organized into library units for
configuration and proof management.  Library units are either
<code>spec</code> (i.e., specification) units or <code>model</code> units.  Each
<code>spec</code> unit corresponds to a unique <code>model</code> unit; EVES
requires the <code>model</code> unit to be a model (in the mathematical
logic sense) of its corresponding <code>spec</code> unit.  A library can be
specified as default by calling the <code>set library</code> command with
the path name of the directory in which the library resides.  The
current state of the EVES database can be saved as either a
<code>spec</code> or <code>model</code> unit by calling the <code>make</code> command.
<code>model</code> units may only be saved if all the proofs are complete
and all the definitions are consistent with its corresponding
<code>spec</code> unit.  The definition of new units may be started by
resetting the state of the EVES database using the <code>reset</code>
command.
<P>
One library unit may <code>load</code> a previously defined <code>spec</code> unit
to access the definitions and conjectures of that unit, if no
circularities are introduced as a result.  The definitions and
conjectures loaded are referenced by prefixing their names with the
name of the unit followed by an exclamation mark.  For example, a
definition <code>def</code> from the library unit <code>lib</code> is referred to
as <code>lib!def</code>.  The only exception to this naming convention is
when the user defines specialized syntax for particular applications,
in which case the user definition overrides the naming convention (see
[<A HREF="node155.html#Meisels94">16</A>] for details on how this is accomplished).  The
special syntax used in the repeater refinement is described in
Appendix&nbsp;<A HREF="node156.html#CSPNotationOverview">A</A>.  The library distributed with
EVES is described in [<A HREF="node155.html#SaaltinkEVES91">27</A>]; a brief summary of the
portion of the EVES Library that we use, including the names of the
units defined, is presented in Section 1 of Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node151.html#RelevantLibraryUnits">13</A>.
<P>
The SVerdi library mechanism supports abstraction, information hiding,
modularization and reuse in the form of Ada-like package
specifications or axiomatic descriptions of mathematical theories.
The <code>spec</code> unit can be used to document the specification portion
of a package as a CSP process stub
and the critical requirements of
that process.  The <code>model</code> unit documents the body portion of the
package as an detailed design of the CSP process and the verification
that it satisfies the critical requirements defined.  More important
for the CSP theory development is the use of the library mechanism to
formulate axiomatic descriptions of mathematical theories given in the
<code>spec</code> unit and model theoretic proofs of their consistency
given in the <code>model</code> unit.  The CSP library developed for EVES
and documented in
[<A HREF="node155.html#MooreEVES94">21</A>] uses this approach to set up the background
theory to specify and verify the repeater.  A brief summary of its
contents, including the names of the units defined, is presented in
Section 2 of Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node151.html#RelevantLibraryUnits">13</A>.

CSP descriptions in FDR consist of three elements: a low-level process
description language, a set of high-level process combination
operators, and a supporting mathematical language.  FDR's low-level
process language allows the definition of relatively small finite
state sequential components in terms of relatively complex
mathematical objects.  FDR's high-level process composition operators
allow low-level process components to be combined into complex system
models.  FDR enforces two restrictions on the combination of these
elements:
<UL><LI> no high-level operators may be nested inside low level processes, and<LI> process descriptions that involve high-level operators may not be
parameterized.
</UL>
These restrictions are made to
ease the FDR verification process.  Since our approach is to translate
a logical CSP design into FDR syntax, we will have
to ensure these restrictions are met throughout the design of
the repeater.  The FDR
parser will reject any specification that does not meet these criteria.
<P>
Unlike EVES, FDR is tailored specifically to process CSP descriptions.
CSP in FDR is strongly typed and has its own built-in language for
defining channels, alphabets and processes.  Channels and the values
that may be communicated are declared as
<BLOCKQUOTE> <PRE>  pragma channel c1,c2,...,cn : v</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
where <TT>ci</TT> is the name of a distinct channel that may communicate the
values in the set <code>v</code>.  <code>v</code> may be either the name of a
previously defined set or the set itself.  Sets are user-defined finite
enumerations that may include integers or truth values; conventional
set notation is used, e.g., <code>MySet = {0,1,2}</code>.
<P>
Although the values transmitted over channels are limited to simple
atomic values, process definitions may be parameterized with more
complex structures such as sets and sequences.  In particular, the
repeater descriptions depend on sequences of bits to represent
characters and buffer contents.  These sequences are parameters to
recursive processes that represent the current state of the repeater.
<P>
FDR supports the definition of functions on the CSP complex structures
in the Standard ML (Meta-Language) programming language
[<A HREF="node155.html#Milner90">18</A>].  To use ML functions in a CSP process description,
the developer must define the ML function, load the function into FDR,
declare the name of the function to be used in the CSP description,
and link the function definition with the appropriate name.

ML functions are defined in a separate file and then loaded into FDR
using the ML <code>use</code> command, e.g., <code>use &quot;filename&quot;</code>.
The syntax for the subset of ML that we use is similar to that for
EVES' CSP function definitions
with extensions to support integration with FDR.  ML function
definitions have the form
<BLOCKQUOTE> <PRE>  fun F (v1,v2,...,vn) =
    Def(v1,v2,...,vn);;</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
where <code>Def</code> is an ML expression in terms of <code>F</code>'s
parameters.
<P>
ML functions that pass values to FDR are required to have a rather
awkward and unintuitive structure.  Such functions must have type
<code>expression list</code>  <IMG WIDTH=14 HEIGHT=6 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18290" SRC="img61.gif"  >  <code>expression</code> or, if it is to be
used as a predicate, <code>expression list</code>  <IMG WIDTH=14 HEIGHT=6 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18290" SRC="img61.gif"  >  <code>bool</code>.  To
cast ML/FDR interface functions in this form, FDR provides a set of
built-in functions to coerce values to type <code>expression</code> and to
interrogate values contained in a variable of type <code>expression</code>.
A sequence of values can be coerced to type <code>expression</code> by
passing the sequence as the first parameter to the <code>EXPseqcomp</code>
function:
<BLOCKQUOTE> <code>EXPseqcomp: expression list</code>  <IMG WIDTH=8 HEIGHT=14 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18294" SRC="img62.gif"  >  <code>expression list</code>
         <IMG WIDTH=14 HEIGHT=6 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18290" SRC="img61.gif"  >  <code>expression</code>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Since a parameter list can be viewed as an expression list,
ML functions used to directly interface to FDR have the form
<BLOCKQUOTE> <PRE>  fun f [EXPseqcomp (list, [])]
        Def (list);;</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
ML functions called by <code>Def</code> use the more general syntax for ML
function definitions described above.  The first argument of
<code>EXPseqcomp</code> is the list of parameters being passed; the second
argument is always empty.  The elaboration of <code>Def</code> requires the
use of other coercion and interrogation functions, the signatures of
which follow:
<BLOCKQUOTE> <code> CheckAtom : expression</code>  <IMG WIDTH=14 HEIGHT=6 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18290" SRC="img61.gif"  >  <code>atomvalue</code>
<P>
<code> Atom : atomvalue</code>  <IMG WIDTH=14 HEIGHT=6 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18290" SRC="img61.gif"  >  <code>expression</code>
<P>
<code> InjectNum : int</code>  <IMG WIDTH=14 HEIGHT=6 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18290" SRC="img61.gif"  >  <code>atomvalue</code>
<P>
<code> NumberOf : atomvalue</code>  <IMG WIDTH=14 HEIGHT=6 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18290" SRC="img61.gif"  >  <code>int</code>

As we mentioned earlier, a literate programming (LP) tool allows the
user to interleave documentation and code in whatever order is most
appropriate for presentation.  However, the tool must be able to
extract and reorder the code ``chunks'' properly for the compiler.
Like other LP tools, FunnelWeb accomplishes this feat with macros and
automatic cross-referencing.
<P>
Each macro may contain some code as well as references to other
macros.  During the code extraction phase, FunnelWeb, starting at the
``root'' macro<A NAME="tex2html7" HREF="footnode.html#612"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC=".//foot_motif.gif"></A>, extracts any code from the macro
and expands all references to other macros.  The process continues
until there are no more references to expand and all of the code is
extracted.  The macros and their cross-references also appear in the
typeset documentation so the reader can see how the code chunks fit
together.
<P>
We use two types of FunnelWeb macros:
<P>
<DL ><DT><DD><B>Simple Macro:</B> The simple macro, by far the most common,
has the following format. (The typographical conventions are
consistent with FunnelWeb's output.)
<PRE><TT>  <IMG WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18306" SRC="img63.gif"  > <I>macro name</I>&#175; <IMG WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18308" SRC="img64.gif"  > [definition number] <IMG WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=8 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18310" SRC="img65.gif"  > 
<P>
  		 <TT>The code to be processed appears here </TT>
<P>
  		  <IMG WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18306" SRC="img63.gif"  > <I>call to another macro</I> <IMG WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18308" SRC="img64.gif"  > 
        [called macro's definition number]
<P>
  This macro is invoked in definition n.
<P>
</TT></PRE>
<P>
The letters <B>M</B> and <B>Z</B> may follow the definition number,
indicating that the macro may be called many times or zero times,
respectively.  The numbers of the definitions that use a macro are
listed in the last line.  Macros that are invoked in a macro that is
not defined in this document are invoked in external files as
described by Section 3 of Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node151.html#RelevantLibraryUnits">13</A>.
<P>
Here is an example of a simple macro.
<PRE><TT>  <IMG WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18306" SRC="img63.gif"  > <I>proc</I>I<>edure example</I> <IMG WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18308" SRC="img64.gif"  > [5] <IMG WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=8 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18310" SRC="img65.gif"  > 
<P>
  		 <TT>proc</TT>T<T>edure example is</TT>
<P>
  		 		  <IMG WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18306" SRC="img63.gif"  > <I>Constants</I> <IMG WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18308" SRC="img64.gif"  > [4]
<P>
  		 <TT>begin</TT>
<P>
  		 		 <TT>for i</TT>T<T> in 1..n loop</TT>
<P>
  		 		 		  <IMG WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18306" SRC="img63.gif"  > <I>Write out first p powers of i</I> <IMG WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18308" SRC="img64.gif"  > [8]
<P>
  		 		 <TT>end loop;</TT>
<P>
  		 <TT>end example;</TT>
<P>
  This macro is invoked in definition 7.
<P>
</TT></PRE>
<P>
  <DT><DD><B>Additive Macro:</B> This macro is like the simple macro
except that its definition may be distributed throughout the document.
Each extension of an additive macro has the same name.  The only
syntactic difference between an additive macro and a simple macro is
that  <IMG WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=8 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18310" SRC="img65.gif"  >  is replaced with  <IMG WIDTH=27 HEIGHT=20 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18332" SRC="img66.gif"  > .
<P>
  <DT><DD><B>Parameterized Macro:</B> As its name implies, the parameterized
macro accepts one or more parameters for its definition.  While not
widely used in this report, this facility is useful in certain cases.
Here is a simple example.
<PRE><TT>  <IMG WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18306" SRC="img63.gif"  > <I>add</I>&#175; <IMG WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18308" SRC="img64.gif"  > [6]
     ( <IMG WIDTH=8 HEIGHT=8 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18338" SRC="img67.gif"  > 2)<B>M</B> <IMG WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=8 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18310" SRC="img65.gif"  > 
<P>
  		  <IMG WIDTH=8 HEIGHT=8 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18338" SRC="img67.gif"  > 1 +  <IMG WIDTH=8 HEIGHT=8 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18338" SRC="img67.gif"  > 2
<P>
  This macro is invoked in definitions 3, 4 and 9.
<P>
</TT></PRE>
This macro takes two parameters and the second is added to the first.
The small diamonds ( <IMG WIDTH=8 HEIGHT=8 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18338" SRC="img67.gif"  > ) distinguish the quantity of parameters
and the parameter numbers from the
definition numbers and ordinary code.
Since it makes little sense to define a parameterized macro to be
invoked only once, the <B>M</B> will usually appear after the
definition number.
An invocation of <I>add</I> is illustrated below in the definition of
another parameterized macro!
The parameter list is enclosed in parentheses and the individual
parameters are enclosed in single quotes and delimited by commas.
<PRE><TT>  <IMG WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18306" SRC="img63.gif"  > <I>double</I>&#175; <IMG WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18308" SRC="img64.gif"  > [3]( <IMG WIDTH=8 HEIGHT=8 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18338" SRC="img67.gif"  > 1)<B>M</B> <IMG WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=8 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18310" SRC="img65.gif"  > 
<P>
  		  <IMG WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18306" SRC="img63.gif"  > <I>add</I> <IMG WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18308" SRC="img64.gif"  > [6](` <IMG WIDTH=8 HEIGHT=8 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18338" SRC="img67.gif"  > 1',` <IMG WIDTH=8 HEIGHT=8 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18338" SRC="img67.gif"  > 1')
<P>
  This macro is invoked in definitions 10 and 11.

<P>
This chapter specifies the critical requirements for a CSP process
called <TT>Rptr</TT> that represents the repeater.  <TT>Rptr</TT>'s critical
requirements derive from both the requirements introduced in
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node10.html#CriticalRequirements">2.1</A> and the assumptions of the CSP
Traces Refinement model introduced in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node19.html#TheCSPComputationalFramework">3.1</A>.  We start with the model assumptions since,
in some sense, they lay the foundation for the specification of the
other critical requirements.  Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node31.html#CriticalRequirementsthatDerivefromModelAssumptions">4.1</A> discusses and motivates the definition
of critical requirements that derive from the model assumptions.
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node37.html#SpecificationoftheFormalAssertions">4.2</A> presents the
<TT>Rptr</TT> formal assertions in the literate style.  Although the
requirements derived from the model assumptions are critical they
cannot be expressed in the CSP Traces Refinement model and, thus, are
not formalized.  Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node114.html#SummaryofthePhysicalArchitectureCriticalRequirements">8.3</A> lists the collection of informal
and formal <TT>Rptr</TT> critical requirements as a basis for future
refinement.

<P>
<P>
As depicted in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node31.html#csprepeater">4.1</A>, the channel <TT>inbit</TT>
represents <TT>Rptr</TT>'s input port and the channel <TT>outbit</TT>
represents <TT>Rptr</TT>'s output port.  The <TT>inbit</TT> and <TT>outbit</TT>
channels are limited to single-bit transmissions per communication
event.  In this chapter, we model only that portion of the repeater
function necessary to describe its critical requirements.  The
omitted function, e.g., error processing and signaling over the
error port, will be introduced during later refinement.
<P>
We derive critical requirements for <TT>Rptr</TT> by interpreting each
Traces Refinement model assumption of Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node19.html#TheCSPComputationalFramework">3.1</A> in terms of the
primitives of the <TT>Rptr</TT>.

This assumption imposes a restriction on the way a CSP process
description may be implemented in software or hardware.  The Traces
Refinement model assumes that the only way a process can communicate
is through channels defined in it's alphabet.  The proof theory
associated with the model enforces this constraint on the CSP process
description, but any refinement
of the description to software or hardware is outside scope of the
CSP theory and must be shown to satisfy the intent of the constraint
independently.
<P>
Although this model assumption primarily imposes a requirement on the
mapping of a CSP process description to an implementation, it is also
helpful to identify assumptions of the environment during the CSP
refinement process.  The only assumption at this level is that power is
continuously supplied to <TT>Rptr</TT>.  This simplification is made so
that it is not necessary to model a power channel explicitly.
Although from a formal perspective the arguments made about <TT>Rptr</TT>
are invalidated by a loss of power, practically speaking power loss
only violates the guaranteed delivery aspect of the <B>Transmit
Characters Until Overflow</B> requirement.

<P>
The assumption that communication events are atomic makes
reasoning about the behavior of CSP processes simpler.  This assumption
appears to be inconsistent with the fact that transmission of data
over a physical channel requires some finite, non-zero amount of time to
complete.  The intent of the assumption, however, is not to force
instantaneous communication, but rather to ensure that the existence
of arbitrary transmission delay does not affect the truth or falsity
of the critical requirements of interest.  Since the Traces Refinement
model of CSP is limited to specifying and proving safety properties
of CSP processes, the time it takes for communications to occur has
no impact on the truth of a property specified in the Traces
Refinement model.  This assumption,
therefore, implies no additional requirement for <TT>Rptr</TT>.

This assumption imposes a restriction on the form of CSP process
descriptions.  The restriction ensures that CSP recursive process
descriptions have a single solution, i.e., a unique meaning.  In
general, process descriptions must be fully refined to ensure
non-divergence.  Nevertheless, the assumption provides important
guidance for the refinement process to ensure non-divergence can be
proven of the final implementation.

The process representing <TT>Rptr</TT> has three parameters:
<UL><LI> <TT>chsz</TT> represents the length in bits of a character
processed.  All characters processed by <TT>Rptr</TT> are delimited by a
<TT>startbit</TT>/<TT>stopbit</TT> combination.  In terms of the variable <TT>K</TT>
introduced in Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node9.html#InformalProblemStatementandSolutionStrategy">2</A>, <TT>chsz</TT> is just <TT>K</TT> reduced by two bits, one bit for
each delimiter (i.e., <TT>chsz</TT> equals <TT>K-2</TT>).<LI> <TT>buffsz</TT> represents the capacity in characters of the
internal buffer.  From an external viewpoint, we have to interpret the
size of the internal buffer referred to in Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node9.html#InformalProblemStatementandSolutionStrategy">2</A> as the difference between the
number of even parity characters received over <TT>inbit</TT> and the
number of characters transmitted over <TT>outbit</TT>.  <TT>Rptr</TT> may be
processing a character in addition to those stored in the internal
buffer; <TT>buffsz</TT> represents the actual maximum number of characters
that can be stored by <TT>Rptr</TT> in addition to the one being processed,
i.e., the value <TT>N-1</TT>.  The maximum size of the internal buffer,
<TT>N</TT>, referred to in Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node9.html#InformalProblemStatementandSolutionStrategy">2</A> is therefore mapped to the maximum capacity of
<TT>Rptr</TT>.  This somewhat awkward interpretation is necessitated by the
desire to start from an external specification of the critical
requirements.<LI>  <IMG WIDTH=34 HEIGHT=10 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18368" SRC="img70.gif"  >  represents the event representing successful
termination.  We use the variable <code>tick</code>, by convention, to represent a
special event that occurs automatically when (and only when) a process
terminates successfully.  <TT>Rptr</TT> terminates successfully after it
halts due to receiving a character that causes an overflow; otherwise,
<TT>Rptr</TT> continues to process characters that it receives.

The alphabet of the repeater consists of communication of bits over

represented in EVES simply as a function with no parameters, i.e., a

These are actually just names of channels representing the medium

The values of these constants are irrelevant as long as they
are distinct.  We make this assumption explicit in the EVES specification
by adding an axiom stating that the values returned by
these functions are different.  This axiom is trivially satisfied

That this is the alphabet for <TT>Rptr</TT> is specified as an axiom at

have yet to be defined.  We assume that <TT>chsz</TT> is a natural number
and  <IMG WIDTH=34 HEIGHT=10 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18372" SRC="img70.gif"  >  is not a communication event.  The latter assumption is
made so that we do not need to worry about  <IMG WIDTH=34 HEIGHT=10 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18374" SRC="img70.gif"  >  being
indistinguishable from a communication event relevant to <TT>Rptr</TT>'s

A trace specification like <TT>valid_relay</TT> is simply a set
of traces.  Elements of the set are chosen from the universe of
possible traces of events and must
conform to <code>valid_relay_spec</code>:

We split <TT>valid_relay_spec</TT>
into two pieces: one when <TT>Rptr</TT> has successfully terminated (i.e.,
 <IMG WIDTH=34 HEIGHT=10 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18376" SRC="img70.gif"  >  is the last event of <TT>Rptr</TT>'s trace) and one when it has not.
Traces of <TT>Rptr</TT> that end with  <IMG WIDTH=34 HEIGHT=10 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18378" SRC="img70.gif"  >  must satisfy <TT>Rptr</TT>'s post
condition; traces of <TT>Rptr</TT> that do not end with  <IMG WIDTH=34 HEIGHT=10 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18380" SRC="img70.gif"  >  must satisfy
<TT>Rptr</TT>'s invariant.  This forms a natural partition of
<TT>valid_relay</TT> since we can say more about the requirements of
<TT>Rptr</TT> when it has terminated.  At termination we can say that all
even parity characters received by <TT>Rptr</TT> before the buffer
overflows have been successfully transmitted.  Before termination, all
we can say is that some subsequence of those characters have been
transmitted.  Henceforth, the phrase <EM>valid characters</EM> refers
only to those characters of even parity received before an overflow.

Under the assumption that <TT>Rptr</TT> has terminated, the three logical
requirements taken together require that
up to the point at which an overflow occurs, the output stream of
characters must be identical to the input stream of characters with
characters of odd parity removed.  Also, nothing other than
identifiable
and complete characters may be transmitted over <TT>outbit</TT>.

Before <TT>Rptr</TT> terminates, we cannot guarantee that every even
parity
character received has been transmitted.  We can guarantee, however,
that the sequence of characters
transmitted over <TT>outbit</TT> must be a prefix of the
sequence of even parity characters received over <TT>inbit</TT> before the
overflow occurred.  This is easily specified in terms of the
primitives already defined.

This chapter presents the logical CSP architecture for <TT>Rptr</TT>
including the decomposition of <TT>Rptr</TT> critical requirements onto the
components of this architecture.  The goal of the logical architecture
(and subsequent logical component refinement) is to describe the most
abstract CSP process description that embodies the critical
requirements of <TT>Rptr</TT> elaborated in the previous chapter.  This
process description will be used as the basis for the FDR refinement
and verification described in Part&nbsp;<A HREF="node108.html#TheRepeaterPhysicalDesign">iii</A>.
By making the semantic gap between the <TT>Rptr</TT> critical requirements
and its logical architecture as small as possible, we can minimize the
extent to which the <TT>Rptr</TT> verification depends on interactive proof
and maximize the extent to which it depends on automatic model
checking.  As mentioned previously, this approach minimizes the human
resources needed to carry out a rigorous verification of intuitively
appealing properties of <TT>Rptr</TT>.
<P>
Decomposition of the <TT>Rptr</TT> formal assertions onto the components of
the logical architecture was carried out using the method described in
[<A HREF="node155.html#Moore90">20</A>].  We present only the final results of the application
of this method; the process by which we reached these results are not
particularly important for understanding the refinement and
verification of <TT>Rptr</TT>.  Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node51.html#OverviewoftheLogicalArchitecture">5.1</A> presents an informal overview of the <TT>Rptr</TT> logical
architecture and the primary responsibilities of its components.
Sections&nbsp;<A HREF="node52.html#GetFormalAssertions">5.2</A> and <A HREF="node56.html#PutFormalAssertions">5.3</A>
describe the alphabet and the critical formal assertions of each
component.  Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node60.html#SummaryoftheLogicalArchitectureCriticalRequirements">5.4</A> summarizes the critical requirements of the logical
architecture.  Finally, Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node65.html#JustificationoftheDecomposition">5.5</A>
outlines the proof that the combination of the component formal
assertions imply the <TT>Rptr</TT> formal assertions.

<P>
<P>
As depicted in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node51.html#logicaldecomp">5.1</A>, <TT>Rptr</TT> is specified as
the composition of two processes: <TT>Get</TT>, which receives and checks
the parity of incoming characters, and <TT>Put</TT>, which maintains the
internal buffer and transmits those characters that passed the parity
check.  The internal channel <TT>mid</TT> is used to pass valid characters
for output.

<DD> <TT>Put</TT> does not send data over <TT>mid</TT>.  
 </DL>
<P>
Intuitively, <TT>Rptr</TT> operates as follows.  The bit stream received
over <TT>inbit</TT> and transmitted over <TT>outbit</TT> can be partitioned
according to the delimited character sequence that the bit stream
represents.  Each segment of the bit stream representing a delimited
character contains the <TT>startbit</TT> at the beginning of the segment
and the <TT>stopbit</TT> at the end of the segment.  For each such segment
received over <TT>inbit</TT>, <TT>Get</TT> determines the parity of the
character that the segment represents.  If the character is of odd
parity it is thrown out and the reception of a new character is
initiated.  Otherwise, the <TT>startbit</TT> and <TT>stopbit</TT> are
stripped off and the character is sent in parallel form over <TT>mid</TT>
to <TT>Put</TT>.  <TT>Put</TT> serializes the data, adds the <TT>startbit</TT> and
<TT>stopbit</TT> delimiters and stores the data until ready for
transmission over <TT>outbit</TT>.
<TT>Rptr</TT>'s components are tightly synchronized; <TT>Get</TT>
can be processing a character and the internal buffer can store a
maximum of <TT>buffsize</TT> characters.  <TT>Get</TT> delays the reception of a
new character until the transmission of the previous
character to <TT>Put</TT>.  At this level of specification, we have not
indicated how or when errors are to be signaled over <TT>err</TT>.
<P>
<DL ><DT><STRONG>Assert 3.1L</STRONG>
<DD> Communication between <TT>Get</TT> sub-processes must be
unidirectional and involve exactly two processes.  
 </DL>
<P>
<DL ><DT><STRONG>Assert 3.3L</STRONG>
<DD> Communication between <TT>Put</TT> sub-processes must be

 </DL>
<P>
A few characteristics of this partitioning of the problem are worth
emphasizing.  The black box view of the problem, described in
Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node9.html#InformalProblemStatementandSolutionStrategy">2</A>,
defines an overflow to occur when the number of bits received over
<TT>inbit</TT> exceeds the number of bits transmitted over <TT>outbit</TT> by
more than <TT>K*N</TT> (i.e., <TT>(chsz + 2) * (buffsz + 1)</TT> in terms of the
formal <TT>Rptr</TT> specification).  While errors can occur in this
refinement due to the reception of characters of odd parity, the tight
synchronization of <TT>Rptr</TT>'s components prohibits the occurrence of
an overflow.  <TT>Rptr</TT> can hold a maximum of <TT>N</TT> delimited
characters, one from <TT>Get</TT> and <TT>N-1</TT> (i.e., <TT>buffsz</TT>) from
<TT>Put</TT>.  Once this maximum is reached, no more characters can be
received until a character is transmitted.

This section presents the critical formal assertions
for <TT>Get</TT>.  The alphabet of <TT>Get</TT> consists of communication of
bits over the previously defined channel <TT>inbit</TT> and
the new channel <TT>mid</TT>.  The fact that <TT>Get</TT> is actually a
sequential process is specified as an axiom at this level of
specification since <TT>Get</TT> has yet to be defined.
We assume that <TT>chsz</TT> is a natural number and
 <IMG WIDTH=34 HEIGHT=10 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18398" SRC="img70.gif"  >  is not a communication event.
The latter assumption is made so that we do not need to worry about
 <IMG WIDTH=34 HEIGHT=10 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18400" SRC="img70.gif"  >  being indistinguishable from a communication event relevant
to <TT>Get</TT>'s description.

As before, a CSP channel is represented as a function with no
parameters, i.e., a constant, so we define a <TT>nilfix</TT> alias for
<TT>mid</TT> to make it easier to use, e.g., <TT>mid</TT> for <TT>mid ()</TT>.
<TT>mid</TT> is actually just a name of a channel representing the medium
for transmission that will be implemented at some lower level.  Its
value is irrelevant as long as it is different than previously
defined channels.  We make this assumption explicit in the EVES
specification by adding a series of axioms stating that the value
returned by <TT>mid</TT> is different than that returned by any other
channel.  These axioms are trivially satisfied by any unique scheme
for assigning values to the channels.

the number of even parity characters received over <TT>inbit</TT> can be at

<TT>valid_char_Get</TT> can be specified much like the
<TT>Rptr</TT>-level critical requirements, except that we need not worry
about overflow.  We split the specification of <TT>valid_char_Get</TT> into
two pieces: one when <TT>Get</TT> has successfully terminated (i.e.,  <IMG WIDTH=34 HEIGHT=10 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18404" SRC="img70.gif"  > 
is the last event of <TT>Get</TT>'s trace) and one when it has not.  Traces
of <TT>Get</TT> that end with  <IMG WIDTH=34 HEIGHT=10 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18406" SRC="img70.gif"  >  must satisfy <TT>Get</TT>'s post condition;
traces of <TT>Get</TT> that do not end with  <IMG WIDTH=34 HEIGHT=10 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18408" SRC="img70.gif"  >  must satisfy <TT>Get</TT>'s
invariant.  This forms a natural partition of <TT>valid_Get</TT> since we
can say much more about the requirements of <TT>Get</TT> when it has
terminated.  At termination we can say that all even parity characters
received by <TT>Get</TT> have been successfully transmitted over <TT>mid</TT>.
Before termination, all we can say is that some subsequence of those
characters have been transmitted.

This section presents the critical formal assertions for <TT>Put</TT> in
much the same manner as those specified for <TT>Get</TT>.  The alphabet of
<TT>Put</TT> consists of communication of bits over the previously defined
channels <TT>outbit</TT> and <TT>mid</TT>.  The fact that <TT>Put</TT> is actually a
sequential process is specified as an axiom at this level of
specification since <TT>Put</TT> has yet to be defined.  Again, we assume
that <TT>chsz</TT> is a natural number and  <IMG WIDTH=34 HEIGHT=10 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18414" SRC="img70.gif"  >  is not a communication
event.  We also assume that the buffer can hold at least one
character.

As we did for <TT>valid_char_Get</TT>, we split the specification of
<TT>valid_char_Put</TT> into two pieces: one when <TT>Put</TT> has successfully
terminated and one when it has not.  Traces of <TT>Put</TT> that end with
 <IMG WIDTH=34 HEIGHT=10 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18418" SRC="img70.gif"  >  must satisfy <TT>Put</TT>'s post condition; traces of <TT>Put</TT> that
do not end with  <IMG WIDTH=34 HEIGHT=10 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18420" SRC="img70.gif"  >  must satisfy <TT>Put</TT>'s invariant.  At termination we
can say that all characters received by <TT>Put</TT> have been
successfully transmitted over <TT>outbit</TT>.  Before termination, all we can
say is that some subsequence of those characters have been
transmitted.

Under the assumption that <TT>Put</TT> has terminated, the critical
requirements for <TT>Rptr</TT> require that the output stream
of characters must be identical to the input stream of characters.  To
ensure that no extraneous bits were transmitted we also specify that
the length of the sequence of bits transmitted over <TT>outbit</TT> be
divisible by the length of a delimited character.

We considered two approaches to define and verify sequential CSP processes
in SVerdi:  a functional approach and a procedural approach.  The
functional approach uses the theory specified in the CSP library,
documented in [<A HREF="node155.html#MooreEVES94">21</A>], to construct sequential processes
using EVES function declarations.  Specification and verification
proceeds in a manner similar to that documented for concurrent
processes in the last chapter.  The procedural approach models
sequential CSP processes as SVerdi procedures.  The critical (trace)
requirements are specified much as they are in the functional
approach, but they appear in the post condition of the SVerdi
procedure that represents the CSP process.  EVES's proof obligation
generator constructs the conditions under which the process conforms
to its requirements.
<P>
The procedural approach requires modeling an interface to a base
machine on which the CSP described system executes.  This interface,
described in the <TT>mach</TT> library unit in Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node150.html#BaseMachineInterface">12</A>, provides a set of communication routines very similar to
the input and output primitives provided by CSP.  An SVerdi procedure
that communicates using these routines builds up a trace of its
execution recorded in a machine variable parameter that represents the
internal state.  This trace forms the basis for the specification of
the procedure's critical requirements.
<P>
The functional approach is more rigorous than the procedural approach
since it does not rely on an informal interpretation of CSP processes
as SVerdi procedures.  Nevertheless, we adopt the procedural approach
in the refinement of the <TT>Rptr</TT> sequential processes.  The
procedural approach reduces the complexity of specifying and verifying
sequential processes by exploiting EVES's approach to decompose the
requirements of SVerdi procedures and automatically generate the proof
obligations required.  We believe that this reduced complexity results
in a more intelligible assurance argument than possible using the
functional approach.
<P>
This chapter begins in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node79.html#OverviewoftheGetDesign">6.1</A> by
describing an overview of the design of <TT>Get</TT> in CSP.
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node80.html#FormalSpecificationoftheGetDesign">6.2</A>
recasts this design in SVerdi by modeling CSP processes as SVerdi
procedures and CSP operations as SVerdi statements.  Critical
requirements Assert 7.1L and Assert 8.1L are cast as a post condition on the
procedure representing <TT>Get</TT>.  Finally, Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node83.html#JustificationoftheGetDesign">6.3</A> decomposes these
requirements onto the primary procedures of the design and argues that
the design satisfies the set of critical requirements of <TT>Get</TT>.

<TT>Get</TT> is a recursive non-terminating CSP process.  Once <TT>Get</TT>
receives the initiating <TT>startbit</TT> over channel <TT>inbit</TT>,
processing of the next character may begin.  One bit arrives over
<TT>inbit</TT> with each iteration of <TT>Get</TT> until the whole character has
been received, i.e., chsz + 2 bits including the delimiters.  If the
character received is of even parity and the final bit received is
<TT>stopbit</TT>, the character is transmitted over <TT>mid</TT>; otherwise,
<TT>Get</TT> ignores the character and initiates reception of the next
character.  The design of <TT>Get</TT> in CSP follows.  <TT>Inchar</TT> is
responsible for receiving the character once the <TT>startbit</TT> has
arrived.  A character has odd parity if the exclusive or of the bits
that constitute the character holds true, where a <TT>1</TT> bit value
represents true and a <TT>0</TT> bit value represents false.
<P>
<PRE>Get(chsz, tick) =
   inbit ? b -&gt; if b = startbit

Inchar(ch,chsz,tick) =
    if (len ch) &lt;= chsz
    then inbit ? b -&gt; Inchar(ch ^ .&lt;b&gt;.,chsz,tick)
    else inbit ? b -&gt; (if     not odd_parity (tail ch)

The machine variable <TT>st</TT> representing internal state provides a
means to transmit of values over channels and, for specification
purposes, to store a record of the sequence of values transmitted.
The current trace of <TT>Get</TT> during execution is evaluated from <TT>st</TT>
and must be restricted to <TT>Get</TT>'s alphabet.  The process trace is
the basis for the specification of <TT>Get</TT>'s two primary requirements:
<TT>Get_not_over_capacity</TT> and <TT>valid_char_Get</TT>.  Showing that these
requirements hold for every prefix of the final trace ensures that
they hold invariantly during <TT>Get</TT>'s execution.  Although the CSP
process representing <TT>Get</TT> does not terminate, EVES requires
termination.  We, therefore, force the SVerdi representation to
terminate at an arbitrary point, i.e., after the variable <TT>cntdwn</TT>
reaches zero.  <TT>cntdwn</TT> starts at the value of the maximum integer,
<TT>int'last()</TT>.  Later refinement will reveal how and when <TT>cntdwn</TT>
decreases.

<TT>buff</TT>.  If <TT>buff</TT> is empty the only option is to receive the next
character over <TT>mid</TT>.  If the current length of <TT>buff</TT> will not
accommodate storing another character the only option is to send the
next bit stored in <TT>buff</TT>.  Finally, if <TT>buff</TT> is not empty and
there is room for storing another character, either of the above
options may occur.
<P>
<TT>Get_step</TT> receives at most one character, stored in the variable
<TT>chr</TT>.  Character variables can be thought of as a trace of bits.
Once <TT>Inchar</TT> has received the character, <TT>Outchar</TT> determines
whether the character is appropriate for transmission over <TT>mid</TT>
and, if so, transmits it.  Note that an input or output operation is
successful if and only if <TT>cntdwn</TT> remains greater than zero.

<TT>Inchar</TT> is a recursive process that iteratively accepts
another bit over <TT>inbit</TT> and appends it to the end of <TT>chr</TT>.  The
recursion bottoms out when the length of <TT>chr</TT> becomes greater than
<TT>chsz</TT>, i.e., the length of the character plus 1 for the
<TT>startbit</TT>.  <TT>cntdwn</TT> must decrease each iteration of <TT>Inchar</TT> since
it will be used as the measure to prove the termination of <TT>Get_step</TT>.

EVES requires that executable recursive definitions be specified in
terms of procedures.  The function <TT>odd_parity</TT> specified previously
in the overview of the <TT>Get</TT> design is defined as an EVES procedure
<TT>odd_parity_check</TT>.  The proof that this procedure terminates with
<TT>is_odd</TT> equal to the value returned by <TT>odd_parity</TT> is trivial.

This chapter uses the same procedural approach to the design of
<TT>Put</TT> as used in the last chapter in the design of <TT>Get</TT> (see the
introduction to Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node78.html#GetComponentRefinement">6</A> for a
description of the approach).  We begin in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node96.html#OverviewofthePutDesign">7.1</A> by describing an overview of the design of <TT>Put</TT> in
CSP.  Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node97.html#FormalSpecificationofthePutDesign">7.2</A> recasts
this design in SVerdi by modeling CSP processes as SVerdi procedures
and CSP operations as SVerdi statements.  Critical requirements Assert 7.2L
and Assert 8.2L are cast as a post condition on the procedure representing
<TT>Put</TT>.  Finally Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node98.html#JustificationofthePutDesign">7.3</A>
decomposes these requirements onto the primary procedures of the
design and argues that the design satisfies the set of critical
requirements of <TT>Put</TT>.

<A NAME="OverviewofthePutDesign">&#160;</A>
<P>
<TT>Put</TT> is a recursive non-terminating CSP process.  Each recurrence
chooses either to send a bit from the internal buffer, i.e., <TT>buff</TT>,
over <TT>outbit</TT> or receive a character over <TT>mid</TT>.  A bit can be
sent whenever there is one available to send; a character can be
received only if the buffer has enough room to store it.
<P>
The buffer has sufficient capacity to store a character if the buffer
is empty, since we assume <TT>buffsz &#;`\>= 1</TT>, or if <TT>buffsz*(chsz+2) &#;`\>=
(len buff)+chsz+2</TT>, since the two delimiting bits are stored along
with each <TT>chsz</TT>-length character.  Characters received are stored
at the right end of the buffer; bits transmitted are taken from the
left end of the buffer.  The design of <TT>Put</TT> in CSP follows:
<P>
<PRE>Put (chsz, buffsz, tick,buff) =
    if null buff
    then mid ? ch -&gt; Put(chsz,buffsz,tick,
                          buff ^ (startbit ]- (ch ^ .&lt;stopbit&gt;.)))
    elseif buffsz*(chsz+2) &lt; (len(buff) + chsz + 2)
    then outbit ! head(buff) -&gt; Put (chsz, buffsz, tick, tail(buff)
    else outbit ! head(buff) -&gt; Put (chsz, buffsz, tick, tail(buff)
         [] mid ? ch -&gt; Put(chsz,buffsz,tick,
                             buff ^ (startbit ]- (ch ^ .&lt;stopbit&gt;.)))
    end if</PRE>

<P>
As in the design of <TT>Get</TT>, the machine variable <TT>st</TT> representing
internal state provides a means to transmit values over channels and, for
specification purposes, to store a record of the sequence of values
transmitted.  The current trace of <TT>Put</TT> during execution is
evaluated from <TT>st</TT> and must be restricted to <TT>Put</TT>'s alphabet.
The process trace is the basis for the specification of <TT>Put</TT>'s two
primary requirements: <TT>Put_not_over_capacity</TT> and
<TT>valid_char_Put</TT>.  Showing that these requirements hold for every
prefix of the final trace ensures that they hold invariantly during
<TT>Put</TT>'s execution.  Although the CSP process representing <TT>Put</TT>
does not terminate, EVES requires termination.  We, therefore, force
the SVerdi representation to terminate at an arbitrary point, i.e.,
after the variable <TT>cntdwn</TT> reaches zero.  <TT>cntdwn</TT> starts at the
value of the maximum integer, <TT>int'last()</TT>.  Later refinement will
reveal how and when <TT>cntdwn</TT> decreases.

<TT>Put</TT>'s buffer <TT>buff</TT> is represented as a first-in first-out queue
of bits.  An iteration of <TT>Put_step</TT> depends on the current state of
<TT>buff</TT>.  If <TT>buff</TT> is empty the only option is to receive the next
character over <TT>mid</TT>.  If the current length of <TT>buff</TT> will not
accommodate storing another character the only option is to send the
next bit stored in <TT>buff</TT>.  Finally, if <TT>buff</TT> is not empty and
there is room for storing another character, either of the above
options may occur.  Note that an input or output operation is
successful if and only if <TT>cntdwn</TT> remains greater than zero.

When both receiving a character over <TT>mid</TT> and sending a bit over
<TT>outbit</TT> is possible, <TT>mid</TT> and <TT>outbit</TT> must be iteratively
polled to determine whether a communication can take place.  Once one
of the communications occurs <TT>buff</TT> is updated as appropriate.

<P>
This chapter presents the physical CSP architecture for <TT>Rptr</TT>.  The
target for the physical architecture and design is the CSP design
specified in [<A HREF="node155.html#Auletta93">1</A>].  We present in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node110.html#OverviewofthePhysicalArchitecture">8.1</A> an overview of the physical architecture
including the primary responsibilities of the components of that
architecture.  Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node111.html#TranslationoftheLogicalDesigntoFDR">8.2</A>
translates the <TT>Rptr</TT> logical design described in SVerdi in
Part&nbsp;<A HREF="node49.html#TheRepeaterLogicalDesign">ii</A> of this document to the syntax
required by FDR.  The FDR logical design is the CSP process
specification to which the physical design must conform.  Section 8.3
summarizes the critical requirements of the physical architecture.
These requirements are derived from the top-level critical
requirements described in Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node30.html#CriticalRequirementsSpecification">4</A>.  This derivation uses the fact that the <TT>Rptr</TT>
logical design conforms to the requirements of Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node10.html#CriticalRequirements">2.1</A> to simplify the physical architecture critical
requirements.  The critical requirements of the physical architecture
were not derived directly from the logical architecture requirements
since the logical architecture has a different structure than the
physical architecture.

<P>
<P>
As depicted in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node110.html#physicaldecomp">8.1</A>, the <TT>Rptr</TT> physical
architecture composes three processes: <TT>Rcv</TT>, which receives and
checks the parity of incoming characters; <TT>Str</TT>, which maintains the
internal buffer; and <TT>Tx</TT>, which transmits those characters that
passed the parity check.  The internal channels <TT>data1</TT> and
<TT>data2</TT> are used to pass characters of even parity for transmission
over <TT>outbit</TT>.  The channels <TT>err1</TT> and <TT>err2</TT> are used to relay
status information, such as parity or framing error, to the operator.
<P>
<DL ><DT><STRONG>Assert 2.1P</STRONG>
<DD> The environment does not send data over <TT>outbit</TT>,
<TT>err1</TT>, or <TT>err2</TT>.  
 </DL>
<P>
At the external interface, the <TT>Rptr</TT> physical design behaves the
same as the <TT>Rptr</TT> design if you ignore communications over the
error channel.  This fact is, of course, the subject of the
justification that the physical design conforms to the design
constraints.  From an internal perspective, the behavior of the
<TT>Rptr</TT> physical design is a refinement of the the behavior of the
<TT>Rptr</TT> logical design.  For each delimited character received over
<TT>inbit</TT>, <TT>Rcv</TT> determines the parity of the character that the
segment represents.  A signal is sent over the error channels
indicating whether the character received had a parity error (not even
parity), a framing error (improper <TT>stopbit</TT> delimiter), or if no
error occurred.  If the character is of odd parity it is thrown out,
and the reception of a new character is initiated.  Otherwise, the
<TT>startbit</TT> and <TT>stopbit</TT> are stripped off and the character is
sent as an integer encoding over <TT>data1</TT> to <TT>Str</TT>.
<P>
<DL ><DT><STRONG>Assert 3.1P</STRONG>
<DD> The environment does not send or receive data over
<TT>data1</TT> or <TT>data2</TT>.  
 </DL>
<P>
<TT>Str</TT> has the capacity to store only a single character at a
time.  When <TT>Tx</TT> is ready, <TT>Str</TT> relays the character
encoded as an integer over <TT>data2</TT> to <TT>Tx</TT>.  <TT>Tx</TT> decodes
the character, adds the <TT>startbit</TT> and <TT>stopbit</TT> delimiters, and transmits
the character in serial for over <TT>outbit</TT>.  As in the logical design,
<TT>Rptr</TT>'s physical components are
tightly synchronized.  <TT>Rcv</TT> cannot receive a new character until it has
transmitted the character it is processing to <TT>Str</TT>.  <TT>Str</TT> cannot
accept another character from <TT>Rcv</TT> until its buffer is empty.  Finally,
<TT>Tx</TT> cannot receive a character from <TT>Str</TT> until it has transmitted
the character that it is processing over <TT>outbit</TT>.  Note that this
design implies that the size of the buffer, <TT>N</TT>, specified in the
initial problem description equals three;  each component has a capacity
of one character.

FDR places certain constraints on CSP descriptions to which the
<TT>Rptr</TT> design currently does not conform:
<UL><LI> Process descriptions that involve high level operators may
not be parameterized.  This implies that the parameters of low level
process descriptions must be concrete.<LI> The set of events that synchronize concurrent components must
be explicit.  Processes are composed with the  <IMG WIDTH=59 HEIGHT=22 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18656" SRC="img88.gif"  >  operator
(where <I>X</I> is the set of events synchronized)
rather than the  <IMG WIDTH=11 HEIGHT=22 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18660" SRC="img89.gif"  >  or the  <IMG WIDTH=19 HEIGHT=22 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18662" SRC="img51.gif"  >  operators.<LI> The set of events hidden for abstraction purposes must be
explicit.  The hiding operator  <IMG WIDTH=6 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18664" SRC="img91.gif"  >  is used to hide internal
events rather than the  <IMG WIDTH=19 HEIGHT=22 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18666" SRC="img51.gif"  >  operator.<LI> Values that may be transmitted over channels are limited to
integers or truth values.  The characters transmitted over <TT>mid</TT> in
the <TT>Rptr</TT> design must be encoded as integers before transmission by
<TT>Get</TT> and decoded before transmission by <TT>Put</TT>.<LI> The successful termination event in FDR is implicit.  The
parameter <TT>tick</TT> in the <TT>Rptr</TT> design is suppressed in the FDR
specification.<LI> Functions returning something other than a CSP process must
be defined in ML.
<P>
</UL>
This section recasts the logical design of Part&nbsp;<A HREF="node49.html#TheRepeaterLogicalDesign">ii</A> to conform to these
constraints in the syntax required by FDR and ML.
The CSP process called <TT>Rptr</TT> in Part&nbsp;<A HREF="node49.html#TheRepeaterLogicalDesign">ii</A> is renamed <TT>RptrSpec</TT> in the FDR
specification.  The CSP process <TT>Rptr</TT> now represents the repeater
physical design.  The goal of the FDR verification will be to show
that <TT>Rptr</TT> refines <TT>RptrSpec</TT>.

Recall that FDR requires that support functions, such as
<TT>odd_parity</TT> and the character coercion functions, to be defined in
ML.  These functions are rather awkward to specify since
FDR requires that the parameters to ML functions be of type ML
<TT>expression</TT> and the return type be either ML <TT>expression</TT> or
<TT>bool</TT>.  FDR provides functions that allow coercion of
<TT>expression</TT>s to/from <TT>atom</TT>s and <TT>atom</TT>s to/from <TT>int</TT> as
described in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node27.html#DefiningandLoadingMLFunctions">3.3.1</A> Using
these coercion functions, <TT>odd_parity</TT> is specified as follows:

The <TT>Rptr</TT> physical design requires defining four new channels: two
for passing characters between the components and two one-bit channels
representing the two-bit error channel.  We use two channels to
represent the error channel for simplicity.  We hide these four
channels in the <TT>Rptr</TT> process implementation since they did not
occur in the <TT>Rptr</TT> design.  The models of refinement in CSP all
require that the set of traces of the process implementation be a
subset of the set permitted by the process specification.

Once the <TT>Rcv</TT> component receives a startbit it begins processing
the next <TT>K</TT>-bit character.  The process <TT>Data</TT> receives all but the

This section presents an intuitive justification that the FDR <TT>Rptr</TT>
physical design satisfies the critical requirements of <TT>Rptr</TT> as
described in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node114.html#SummaryofthePhysicalArchitectureCriticalRequirements">8.3</A>.  We argue informally that the physical design
satisfies the informal assertions.  We use a combination of
informal and formal techniques to argue that the physical design
satisfies the formal assertions.  In particular we use the FDR model checker
to demonstrate that the <TT>Rptr</TT> physical design satisfies the
constraints of the <TT>Rptr</TT> specification.

The formalization of the repeater critical requirements is based on a
theory, called <code>cseq</code>, for partitioning a bit stream into a
sequence of characters and for reasoning about the bit stream in an
abstract manner.  The theory also includes facilities for reasoning
about the parity of characters.  Characters include all
<TT>chsz</TT>-length sequences of bits.

All characters processed by <TT>Rptr</TT> are delimited by a
<TT>startbit</TT>/<TT>stopbit</TT> combination.  These values are implemented as
SVerdi functions, <TT>start_bit</TT> and <TT>stop_bit</TT>, with no parameters.
Since these values are really constants we define <TT>nilfix</TT> aliases
for each to make them easier to use.  To
avoid confusion, henceforth, we refer to a character that is delimited
appropriately as a <EM>delimited character</EM>; the term <EM>character</EM>
simply refers to the entity between the delimiters.

The primary operations provided by <TT>cseq</TT> are to identify character
sequences (<TT>is_char_seq</TT>), to convert between bit streams and
character sequences (<TT>char_seq</TT> and <TT>flatten</TT>), and to determine
the current (partial) character being processed (<TT>current_char</TT>).
These functions are used many times in the definition and
decomposition of the repeater critical requirements.

We begin by defining each of the above functions in terms of a set of
secondary operations.  <TT>is_char_seq</TT> describes a trivial predicate
that holds if and only if each element of the sequence that it is
passed is a character, via the <TT>is_char</TT> call.

<TT>char_seq</TT> begins by searching through the bit stream for the first
<TT>startbit</TT>.  Once found, a decision must be made whether the bit
sequence starting at that <TT>startbit</TT> begins with a valid delimited
character, i.e., whether <TT>has_char (s, chsz)</TT> returns <TT>true</TT>.  If
so, the character is retrieved, via the <TT>char_head</TT> call, and the
search continues by recurring on all but the first delimited
character, via the first <TT>char_tail</TT> call.  Otherwise, the malformed
delimited character (which may be merely an incomplete delimited
character) is discarded, via the second <TT>char_tail</TT> call, and the
search continues.  The recursion bottoms out when the bit sequence is
null, returning the empty sequence.  This process constructs the
<TT>chsz</TT>-length character sequence formed from the bit sequence <TT>s</TT>.

The procedural approach to modeling CSP sequential processes using
EVES requires using only executable SVerdi constructs.  Although
traces are useful for storing characters in the specifications about
<TT>Rptr</TT>, they cannot be used in SVerdi procedure definitions since
they are not executable.  This section characterizes a module called
<TT>bfr</TT> that includes a set of operations on a data type called
<TT>buffer</TT> used to store sequences of characters.

Objects of type buffer are isomorphic to traces of
<TT>bit</TT>s in the sense that there is a mapping from buffers to traces of
<TT>bit</TT>s that is one-to-one and onto.  We call this mapping <TT>contents</TT>;
we call its inverse <TT>rebuff</TT>.  We specify the properties of
<TT>buffer</TT> only at its interface since we are not concerned at this
point with an implementation.  Of course, any implementation would
require that buffers be bounded which would imply a more constrained
interface.

The isomorphic nature of buffers and traces of <TT>bit</TT>s implies that each
operation on traces has a counterpart for buffers.  As a notational
convenience we name each operation on a <TT>buffer</TT> similar to its
counterpart.  In particular, operations named by a sequence of
alphabetic characters are modified by appending the letter <TT>p</TT> onto
the end, e.g., <TT>tailp</TT> for the <TT>tail</TT> of a buffer.  Operations
named by a special symbol are modified by delimiting the symbol with
backward quote marks, e.g., <TT>`&#;``</TT> for <TT>&#;`^</TT>.

As mentioned there is a one to one correspondence between the
operations on buffers and the operations on traces of bits.  This
correspondence is specified as a sequence of rules that are assumed
without proof.  These rules are the natural ones expected.

keeps track of the status of relevant communication channels and the
values that have been transmitted over those channels.
This section describes an SVerdi library unit called <TT>mach</TT> that
characterizes the interface to this machine.
<P>
The state of a sequential process is characterized by a machine
variable of type <TT>state</TT>.  The only way this variable can be
accessed or modified is by the facilities provided by <TT>mach</TT>.  The
structure of the <TT>state</TT> data type is hidden from any units using
<TT>mach</TT>.

<TT>mach</TT> provides facilities to send <TT>bit</TT>s over channels.  As in
the specification, channel identifiers
are simply represented as integers.  The variable <TT>cntdwn</TT>, which
serves as the measure for the loop,
represents an upper bound on the number of times the channel is to be
polled before the communication is aborted.  Note that the invariant
for the loop of <TT>snd_bit</TT> is the same as the post-condition for the
polling routine.  <TT>cntdwn</TT> must decrease each iteration and be bounded
below by zero.  The <TT>bit</TT> is sent only if the variable <TT>sent</TT> is
<TT>true</TT> and <TT>cntdwn</TT> is greater than zero; otherwise no change to
the trace is incurred.  The primary difference between <TT>snd_bit</TT> and
<TT>poll_snd_bit</TT> below is that <TT>snd_bit</TT> guarantees that the <TT>bit</TT> is
sent as long as cntdwn does not reach zero.  <TT>poll_snd_bit</TT> polls
the channel to determine whether a <TT>bit</TT> may be sent and, if so, sends
it.

<TT>mach</TT> provides facilities to send and receive characters very
similar to those provided to send and receive bits.  The primary
difference is that, on reception, the character size <TT>chsz</TT> is
passed and the predicate <TT>cseq!is_char</TT> is guaranteed to hold for
the character received.

This section outlines the library units containing the repeater
specification, implementation and proof.  Because of their size, these
units are not included <EM>in their entirety</EM> in this document.
Instead, we selected certain functions and rules from each theory to
elaborate.  FunnelWeb helps us maintain consistency between the
functions and rules as they are defined in this document and in the
external unit.  These units are specified fully in [<A HREF="node155.html#MooreRptrLib94">19</A>].
<P>
If the reader encounters a FunnelWeb macro definition whose definition
invocation number is higher than any FunnelWeb macro presented in this
document (e.g., the reader sees &quot;This macro is invoked in definition
203.&quot;, and the highest macro definition number presented here is 191),
then that macro definition is invoked in an external unit.  The names
of the files containing these macros are listed below in the context
of aFunnelWeb additive macro.  Files ending with ``s''
contain specification units; files ending with ``m''
contain model units.

<P>
<A NAME="CSPNotationOverview">&#160;</A>
<P>
This appendix summarizes the notation that we use to write CSP
specifications and process descriptions.  This notation subsumes
relevant notation provided by SVerdi in [<A HREF="node155.html#Meisels94">16</A>], by CSP in
[<A HREF="node155.html#Hoarecsp85">9</A>], and by FDR in [<A HREF="node155.html#FDR94">6</A>].  The degree to which we
could maintain compatibility was limited by the constraints on
user-extensible syntax of SVerdi.  Appendix&nbsp;<A HREF="node165.html#NotationalVariations">B</A> describes the variations on this notation required by the
constraints of the mechanical tools.
<P>
In addition to briefly describing the meaning of the fundamental
operators, information important for parsing CSP is presented in
a tabular format.  For each operator presented, its meaning, relative
precedence, and full SVerdi function name, if any, is indicated.
Operators may be of the following types:
<BLOCKQUOTE> <DL ><DT><STRONG>nilfix</STRONG>
<DD> -- a constant, e.g., <code>true</code>;
<DT><STRONG>prefix</STRONG>
<DD> -- a unary operator occurring before its parameter,
e.g., -1;
<DT><STRONG>infix</STRONG>
<DD> -- a binary operator occurring between two parameters,
e.g., 1+2;
<DT><STRONG>postfix</STRONG>
<DD> -- a unary operator occurring after its parameter,
e.g., 5!;
<DT><STRONG>list</STRONG>
<DD> -- an n-ary operator representing a list, e.g., a pair
represented in Verdi as pair!pair(a,b) is represented as  <IMG WIDTH=55 HEIGHT=22 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18810" SRC="img95.gif"  > ;
<DT><STRONG>plist</STRONG>
<DD> -- an n-ary operator representing a paired list, e.g., a set
represented in Verdi as (setadd <I>a</I> (setadd <I>b</I> (setadd <I>c</I> (nullset)))) is
represented as  <IMG WIDTH=51 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18818" SRC="img96.gif"  >  and corresponds to the Verdi functions setadd
and nullset; and
<DT><STRONG>multifix</STRONG>
<DD> -- a more flexible n-ary operator that allows internal
operator symbols to vary, e.g., the concurrent process denoted
 <IMG WIDTH=97 HEIGHT=22 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline18820" SRC="img97.gif"  > .
<A NAME="tex2html386" HREF="footnode.html#4819"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC=".//foot_motif.gif"></A>
<P>
 </DL></BLOCKQUOTE>
The precedence of each operator is given on a scale of 0 to 24 where
the higher numbers indicate higher precedence.  Finally, the full
function name, when written in prefix form, is provided so that
the properties that the SVerdi
operator inherits from Verdi, if any, are apparent from the Verdi
Language Definition [<A HREF="node155.html#Craigen91a">4</A>].  The function name is also
needed when performing the <code>invoke</code> prover command, so that the parser
can easily resolve which (potentially overloaded) operator should be
expanded.
