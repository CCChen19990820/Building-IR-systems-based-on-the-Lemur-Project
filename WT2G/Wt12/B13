<P>With the Gulf war officially over, broader questions come to the fore: What are the likely contours of the New World Order, specifically, for the Middle East? What do we learn about the victors, whose power is at least temporarily enhanced?

<P>A standard response is that we live in "an era full of promise," "one of those rare transforming moments in history" (James Baker). The United States "has a new credibility," the President announced, and dictators and tyrants everywhere know "that what we say goes." George Bush is "at the height of his powers" and "has made very clear that he wants to breathe light into that hypothetical creature, the Middle East peace process" (Anthony Lewis). So things are looking up.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1" HREF="#FN1">1</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Others see a different picture. A Catholic weekly in Rome, close to the Vatican, writes that Bush is the "surly master of the world," who deserves "the Nobel War Prize" for ignoring opportunities for peace in the Gulf. Bush "had the very concrete possibility of a just peace and he chose war." He "didn't give a damn" about the many peace appeals of Pope John Paul II and proposals of others, never veering from his objective of a murderous war (<CITE>Il Sabato</CITE>).

<P>The <CITE>Times of India</CITE> described Bush's curt dismissal of Iraq's February 15 offer to withdraw from Kuwait as a "horrible mistake," which showed that the West sought a "regional Yalta where the powerful nations agree among themselves to a share of Arab spoils.... [The West's] conduct throughout this one month has revealed the seamiest sides of Western civilisation: its unrestricted appetite for dominance, its morbid fascination for hi-tech military might, its insensitivity to `alien' cultures, its appalling jingoism...." A leading Third World monthly condemned "The most cowardly war ever fought on this planet." The foreign editor of Brazil's major daily wrote that "What is being practiced in the Gulf is pure barbarism -- ironically, committed in the name of civilization. Bush is as responsible as Saddam.... Both, with their inflexibility, consider only the cold logic of geopolitical interests [and] show an absolute scorn for human life." The "Business Magazine of the Developing World" predicts that the Arab states will "in effect...become <I>vassal states,</I>" losing such control as they once had over their resources (<CITE>South,</CITE> London).<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2" HREF="#FN2">2</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>All of this was before the glorious "turkey shoot" in the desert and the "euphoria" and unconcealed bloodlust it evoked until the news managers thought better of the project and suddenly called it off.

<P>Outside the West, such perceptions are common. One experienced British journalist observes that "Despite the claims by President Bush that Desert Storm is supported by `the whole world', there can be little doubt about which side has won the contest for the hearts and minds of the masses of the Third World; it is not the US" (Geoffrey Jansen). Commenting on the world's "moral unease" as the air war began, John Lloyd noted in the London <CITE>Financial Times</CITE> that the US and Britain are a "tiny minority in the world" in their war policy. <CITE>South</CITE> concludes that the French, Italians and Turks joined the US-British war only "to secure a slice of the pie in the form of lucrative reconstruction and defence contracts in a post-war Gulf or in the form of aid and credits or both." Reports from the Third World, including most of the neighboring countries, indicated substantial, often overwhelming, popular opposition to the US-UK war, barely controlled by the US-backed tyrannies. The Iraqi democratic opposition publicly opposed the war, and even the most pro-American Iraqi exiles condemned the "wanton quality of the violence" in Bush's "dirty and excessively destructive war" (Samir al-Khalil).<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3" HREF="#FN3">3</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Before evaluating such conflicting perceptions, we have to settle a methodological question. There are two ways to proceed. One is to rely on the rhetoric of power: George Bush has "made it clear" that he is going to "breathe light" into the problems of suffering humanity; that settles the matter. Perhaps there are some blemishes on our record, but we have undergone another of those miraculous changes of course that occur at convenient moments, so we need not trouble ourselves with the documentary record, the events of past and present history, and their institutional roots. That is the easy way, and the path to respectability and privilege. Another approach, lacking these advantages, is to consider the facts. Not surprisingly, these approaches commonly yield quite different conclusions.


<H3>"The Surly Master of the World"</H3>

<P>Adopting the second approach, we face some obvious questions. Consider the President's proud boast that <I>dictators and tyrants</I> know "that what we say goes." It is beyond dispute that the US has no problem with dictators and tyrants if they serve US interests, and will attack and destroy committed democrats if they depart from their service function. The correct reading of Bush's words, then, is: "What we say goes," whoever you may be.

<P>Continuing on this course, we find no grounds to expect George Bush to "breathe light" into the Middle East peace process, or any other problem. In fact, why is the peace process a "hypothetical creature"? Though inexpressible in polite company, the answer is not obscure: the US has kept it that way. Washington has barred the way to a diplomatic settlement of the Arab-Israel conflict since February 1971 (coincidentally, just as George Bush appeared on the national scene as UN Ambassador), when Kissinger backed Israel's rejection of Egyptian President Sadat's proposal for a peace settlement in terms virtually identical to official US policy, without even a gesture towards the Palestinians. The US has regularly rejected other peace proposals, vetoed Security Council resolutions, and voted against General Assembly resolutions calling for a political settlement. In December 1990, the General Assembly voted 144-2 (US and Israel) to call an international conference. A year before, the Assembly voted 151-3 (US, Israel, Dominica) for a settlement incorporating the wording of UN Resolution 242, along with "the right to self-determination" for the Palestinians.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT4" HREF="#FN4">4</A></FONT></SUP> The NATO allies, the USSR, the Arab states, and the nonaligned countries have been united for years in seeking a political settlement along these lines, but the US will not permit it, so the peace process remains "hypothetical."

<P>In part for similar reasons, reduction of armaments has been a "hypothetical creature." In April 1990, Bush flatly rejected a proposal from his friend Saddam Hussein to eliminate weapons of mass destruction from the Middle East. One way to direct petrodollars to the US economy has been to encourage arms sales. Currently, Bush is proposing to sell $18 billion worth of arms to his Middle East allies, with the Export-Import Bank underwriting purchases, at below-market rates if necessary, a hidden tax to benefit major sectors of industry. Military victories by the US and its Israeli client have long been used as an export-promotion device. Corporations may hire showrooms to display their goods; the government hires the Sinai and Iraqi deserts.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT5" HREF="#FN5">5</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>There are no plausible grounds for optimistic expectations now that the great power that has kept the peace process "hypothetical" and has helped keep the region armed to the teeth is in an even stronger position than before to tell the world that "what we say goes."

<P>The Administration has in fact taken pains to present itself as "surly master of the world." As the ground campaign opened, <CITE>New York Times</CITE> correspondent Maureen Dowd quoted a leaked section of a National Security Policy Review from the first months of the Bush presidency, dealing with "third world threats." It reads: "In cases where the U.S. confronts much weaker enemies, our challenge will be not simply to defeat them, but to defeat them decisively and rapidly." Any other outcome would be "embarrassing" and might "undercut political support."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT6" HREF="#FN6">6</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>"Much weaker enemies" pose only one threat to the United States: the threat of independence, always intolerable. For many years, it was possible to disguise the war against Third World nationalism with Cold War illusions, but that game is over and the real story is bright and clear: the primary target has always been Third World independence, called "radical nationalism" or "ultranationalism" in the internal planning record, a "virus" that must be eradicated.

<P>The <CITE>Times</CITE> report makes no reference to peaceful means. That too is standard. As understood on all sides, in its confrontations with Third World threats, the US is "politically weak"; its demands will not gain public support, so diplomacy is a dangerous exercise. That is why the US has so commonly sought to keep diplomatic processes "hypothetical" in the Middle East, Central America, Indochina, and on other issues, and why it has regularly undermined the United Nations. Furthermore, political support at home is understood to be very thin. Naturally, one does not want to confront enemies that can fight back, but even much weaker enemies must be destroyed quickly, given the weakness of the domestic base and the lessons that are to be taught.

<P>These lessons are directed to several audiences. For the Third World, the message is simple: Don't raise your heads. A "much weaker" opponent will not merely be defeated, but pulverized. The central lesson of World Order is: "What we say goes"; we are the masters, you shine our shoes, and don't ever forget it. Others too are to understand that the world is to be ruled by force, the arena in which the US reigns supreme, though with its domestic decline, others will have to pay the bills.


<H3>The Lessons at Home</H3>

<P>There is also a lesson for the domestic audience. They must be terrorized by images of a menacing force about to overwhelm us -- though in fact "much weaker" and defenseless. The monster can then be miraculously slain, "decisively and rapidly," while the frightened population celebrates its deliverance from imminent disaster, praising the heroism of the Great Leader who has come to the rescue just in the nick of time.

<P>These techniques, which have familiar precedents, were employed through the 1980s, for sound reasons. The population was opposed to the major Reagan policies, largely an extension of Carter plans. It was therefore necessary to divert attention to ensure that democratic processes would remain as "hypothetical" as the peace process. Propaganda campaigns created awesome chimeras: international terrorists, Sandinistas marching on Texas, narcotraffickers, crazed Arabs. Even Grenada was portrayed as a mortal threat, with fevered tales of an air base that would be used to attack the continent, huge Soviet military stores, and the threat to Caribbean sea lanes. Only a year ago, Noriega -- a minor thug by international standards -- was elevated to the status of Genghis Khan as the US prepared to invade Panama to restore the rule of the 10% white minority and to ensure that the Canal Treaty, or some remnant of it, will not interfere with US control over the Canal and the military bases there. Government-media Agitprop has had some success. The tourism industry in Europe repeatedly collapsed while Americans cower in terror, afraid to travel to European cities where they would be 100 times as safe as they are at home, eliciting much derision in the right-wing European press.

<P>In the Old World Order, the Soviet threat was skillfully deployed to mobilize public support for intervention abroad and for subsidies to high tech industry at home. These basic institutional requirements remain a policy guide, and they have their consequences. During Bush's two years in office, real wages continued to decline, falling to the level of the late 1950s for non-supervisory workers (about 2/3 of the work force). Three million more children crossed the poverty line. Over a million people lost their homes. Infant mortality increased beyond its already scandalous levels. Federal spending dropped for education and for non-military R&D. Government, corporate and household debt continued to rise, in part concealed with various budgetary scams. Financial institutions drowned in red ink, following the S&Ls, set on their course by the Deregulation Task Force headed by George Bush. The gap between rich and poor grew to postwar record levels. Civic services collapsed further while the US took a healthy lead worldwide in prison population per capita, doubling the figure during the Reagan-Bush years, with black males now four times as likely to be in prison as in South Africa. And the "third deficit" of unmet social and economic needs (repairing infrastructure, etc.) is calculated at some $130 billion annually, omitting the S&Ls.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT7" HREF="#FN7">7</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>As inspection of its domestic programs makes clear, the Administration has no intention of addressing such problems; rightly, from its point of view. Any serious measures would infringe upon the prerogatives of its constituency. For the executives of a transnational corporation or other privileged sectors, it is important for the world to be properly disciplined, for advanced industry to be subsidized, and for the wealthy to be guaranteed security. It does not matter much if public education and health deteriorate, the useless population rots in urban concentrations or prisons, and the basis for a livable society collapses for the public at large.

<P>For such reasons, it is important to distract the domestic population. They must join their betters in admiring "the stark and vivid definition of principle...baked into [George Bush] during his years at Andover and Yale, that honor and duty compels you to punch the bully in the face" -- the words of the awe-struck reporter who released the Policy Review explaining how to deal with "much weaker enemies."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT8" HREF="#FN8">8</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The principle that you punch the bully in the face -- when you are sure that he is securely bound and beaten to a pulp -- is a natural one for advocates of the rule of force. It teaches the right lessons to the world. And at home, cheap victories deflect the attention of a frightened population from domestic disasters while the state pursues its tasks as global enforcer, serving the interests of the wealthy. Meanwhile, the country continues its march towards a two-tiered society with striking Third World features.

<P>The same <CITE>Times</CITE> reporter goes on to quote the gallant champion himself: "By God, we've kicked the Vietnam syndrome once and for all." The second national newspaper joined in, applauding the "spiritual and intellectual" triumph in the Gulf: "Martial values that had fallen into disrepute were revitalized," and "Presidential authority, under assault since Vietnam, was strengthened." With barely a gesture towards the dangers of overexuberance, the ultraliberal <CITE>Boston Globe</CITE> hailed the "victory for the psyche" and the new "sense of nationhood and projected power" under the leadership of a man who is "one tough son of a bitch," a man with "the guts to risk all for a cause" and a "burning sense of duty," who showed "the depth and steely core of his convictions" and his faith that "we are a select people, with a righteous mission in this earth," the latest in a line of "noble-minded missionaries" going back to his hero Teddy Roosevelt -- who was going to "show those Dagos that they will have to behave decently" and to teach proper lessons to the "wild and ignorant people" standing in the way of "the dominant world races." Liberal columnists praised "the magnitude of Bush's triumph" over a much weaker enemy, dismissing the "uninformed garbage" of those who carp in dark corners (Thomas Oliphant). The open admiration for fascist values is a matter of some interest.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT9" HREF="#FN9">9</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>For 20 years, there have been vigorous efforts to "kick the Vietnam syndrome," defined by Reaganite intellectual Norman Podhoretz as "the sickly inhibitions against the use of military force." He thought the disease was cured when we were "standing tall" after our astounding victory in Grenada. Perhaps that triumph of martial virtues was not enough, but now, at last, we have kicked these sickly inhibitions, the President exults. "Bush's leadership has transformed the Vietnam Syndrome into a Gulf Syndrome, where `Out Now!' is a slogan directed at aggressors, not at us" (Thomas Oliphant); we were the injured party in Vietnam, defending ourselves from the Vietnamese aggressors, from "internal aggression" as Adlai Stevenson explained in 1964. Having overcome the Vietnam syndrome, we now observe "the worthy and demanding standard that aggression must be opposed, in exceptional cases by force," Oliphant continues -- but, somehow, we are not to march on Jakarta, Tel Aviv, Damascus, Washington, Ankara, and a long series of other capitals.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT10" HREF="#FN10">10</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The ground had been well prepared for overcoming this grave malady, including dedicated labors to ensure that the Vietnam war is properly understood -- as a "noble cause," not a violent assault against South Vietnam, then all of Indochina. When the President proclaims that we will no longer fight with one hand tied behind our backs, respectable opinion asks only whether we were indeed too restrained in Indochina, or whether our defense of freedom was always a "lost cause" and a "mistake." It is "clear," the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> reports, that "the lesson of Vietnam was a sense of the limits of United States power"; in contrast, the lesson of Afghanistan is not a sense of the limits of Soviet power. Reviewing the "heroic tale" of a Vietnamese collaborator with the French colonialists and their American successors, the <CITE>Times</CITE> describes the methods he devised in 1962 to destroy the "political organization" of the South Vietnamese revolutionaries. The most successful device was to send "counter-terror teams to track down and capture or kill recalcitrant Vietcong officials" -- <I>counter-terror teams,</I> because it was the US and its clients who were assassinating civilians to undermine an indigenous political organization that far surpassed anything the US could construct, as fully conceded.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT11" HREF="#FN11">11</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>So effectively has history been rewritten that an informed journalist at the left-liberal extreme can report that "the US military's distrust of cease-fires seems to stem from the Vietnam War," when the Communist enemy -- but not, apparently, the US invaders -- "used the opportunity [of a bombing pause] to recover and fight on" (Fred Kaplan). Near the dissident extreme of scholarship, the chairman of the Center for European Studies at Harvard can inform us that Nixon's Christmas bombing of Hanoi in 1972 "brought the North Vietnamese back to the conference table" (Stanley Hoffmann). Such fables, long ago demolished, are alive and well, as the propaganda system has elegantly recovered; no real problem among the educated classes, who had rarely strayed from the Party Line. Americans generally estimate Vietnamese deaths at about 100,000, a recent academic study reveals. Its authors ask what conclusions we would draw about the political culture of Germany if the public estimated Holocaust deaths at 300,000, while declaring their righteousness. A question we might ponder.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT12" HREF="#FN12">12</A></FONT></SUP>


<H3>The Leader and his Teachings</H3>

<P>George Bush's career as a "public servant" also has its lessons concerning the New World Order. He is the one head of state who stands condemned by the World Court for "the unlawful use of force"; in direct defiance of the Court, he persisted in the terror and illegal economic warfare against Nicaragua to prevent a free election in February 1990, then withheld aid from his chosen government because of its refusal to drop the World Court suit. Bush dismisses with contempt the Court's call for reparations for these particular crimes (others are far beyond reach), while he and his sycophants solemnly demand reparations from Iraq, confident that respectable opinion will see no problem here.

<P>Or in the fact that in March 1991, the Administration once again contested World Court jurisdiction over claims resulting from its crimes; in this case, Iran's request that the Court order reparations for the downing of an Iranian civilian airliner in July 1988 by the US warship <I>Vincennes,</I> part of the naval squadron sent by Reagan and Bush to support Iraq's aggression. The airbus was shot down in a commercial corridor off the coast of Iran with 290 people killed -- out of "a need to prove the viability of Aegis," its high tech missile system, in the judgment of US Navy commander David Carlson, who "wondered aloud in disbelief" as he monitored the events from his nearby vessel. Bush further sharpened our understanding of the sacred Rule of Law in April 1990, when he conferred the Legion of Merit award upon the commander of the <I>Vincennes</I> (along with the officer in charge of anti-air warfare) for "exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding service" in the Gulf and for the "calm and professional atmosphere" under his command during the period when the airliner was shot down. "The tragedy isn't mentioned in the texts of the citations," AP reported. The media kept a dutiful silence -- at home, that is. In the less disciplined Third World, the facts were reported in reviews of US terrorism and "U.S. imperial policy" generally.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT13" HREF="#FN13">13</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Bush opened the post-Cold War era with the murderous invasion of Panama. Since he became UN Ambassador in 1971, the US is far in the lead in vetoing Security Council resolutions and blocking the UN peacekeeping function, followed by Britain -- "our lieutenant (the fashionable word is partner)," in the words of a senior Kennedy advisor.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT14" HREF="#FN14">14</A></FONT></SUP> Bush took part in the Reaganite campaign to undermine the UN, adding further blows during the Gulf crisis. With threats and bribery, the US pressured the Security Council to wash its hands of the crisis, authorizing individual states to proceed as they wished, including the use of force (UN Resolution 678). The Council thus seriously violated the UN Charter, which bars any use of force until the Council determines that peaceful means have been exhausted (which, transparently, they had not, so no such determination was even considered), and requires further that the Security Council -- not George Bush -- will determine what further means may be necessary. Having once again subverted the UN, the US compelled the Security Council to violate its rules by refusing repeated requests by members for meetings to deal with the mounting crisis, rules that the US had angrily insisted were "mandatory" when it objected to brief delays in earlier years. In further contempt for the UN, the US bombed Iraqi nuclear facilities, proudly announcing the triumph shortly after the General Assembly reaffirmed the long-standing ban against such attacks and called upon the Security Council "to act immediately" if such a violation occurs; the vote was 144-1, the US in splendid isolation as usual (Dec. 4, 1990).<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT15" HREF="#FN15">15</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Bush was called to head the CIA in 1975, just in time to support near-genocide in East Timor, a policy that continues with critical US-UK support for General Suharto, whose achievements even dim the lustre of Saddam Hussein. Meanwhile, exhibiting his refined taste for international law, Bush looks the other way as his Australian ally arranges with the Indonesian conqueror to exploit Timorese oil, rejecting Portugal's protest to the World Court on the grounds that "There is no binding legal obligation not to recognize acquisition of territory by force" (Foreign Minister Gareth Evans). Furthermore, Evans explains, "The world is a pretty unfair place, littered with examples of acquisition by force..."; and in the same breath, following the US-UK lead, he bans all official contacts with the PLO with proper indignation because of its "consistently defending and associating itself with Iraq's invasion of Kuwait." Recognizing that the monumental cynicism might disrupt the posturing about international law and the crime of aggression, the ideological institutions have protected the public from such undesirable facts, keeping them in the shadows along with a new Indonesian military offensive in Timor under the cover of the Gulf crisis, and the Western-backed Indonesian operations that may wipe out a million tribal people in Irian Jaya, with thousands of victims of chemical weapons among the perhaps 300,000 already killed, according to human rights activists and the few observers.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT16" HREF="#FN16">16</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The attention of the civilized West is to be focused, laser-like, on the crimes of the official enemy, not on those we could readily mitigate or eliminate, without tens of thousands of tons of bombs.

<P>On becoming Vice-President, Bush travelled to Manila to pay his respects to another fine killer and torturer, Ferdinand Marcos, praising him as a man "pledged to democracy" who had performed great "service to freedom," and adding that "we love your adherence to democratic principle and to the democratic processes." He lent his talents to the war against the Church and other deviants committed to "the preferential option for the poor" in Central America, now littered with tortured and mutilated bodies, perhaps devastated beyond recovery. In the Middle East, Bush supported Israel's harsh occupations, its savage invasion of Lebanon, and its refusal to honor Security Council Resolution 425 calling for its immediate withdrawal from Lebanon (March 1978, one of several). The plea was renewed by the government of Lebanon in February 1991,<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT17" HREF="#FN17">17</A></FONT></SUP> ignored as usual while the US client terrorizes the occupied region and bombs elsewhere at will, and the rest of Lebanon is taken over by Bush's new friend Hafez el-Assad, a clone of Saddam Hussein.

<P>Another friend, Turkish president Turgut Ozal, was authorized to intensify Turkey's repression of Kurds in partial payment for his services as "a protector of peace," in Bush's words, joining those who "stand up for civilized values around the world" against Saddam Hussein. While making some gestures towards his own Kurdish population and attempting to split them from Iraqi Kurds, Ozal continues to preside over "the world's worst place to be Kurdish" (Vera Saeedpour, director of the New York-based program that monitors Kurdish human rights). Journalists, the Human Rights Association in the Kurdish regions, and lawyers report that this protector of civilized values has made use of his new prestige to have his security forces expel 50,000 people from 300 villages, burning homes and possessions so that the people will not return, and fire on anti-war demonstrators, while continuing the torture that is standard procedure in all state security cases. The Frankfurt relief organization Medico International reported in late January that hundreds of thousands of Kurds were in flight from cities near the Iraqi frontier, with women, children and old people trying to survive the cold winter in holes in the ground or animal sheds while the government bars any help or provisions, the army is destroying fields with flame throwers, and jet planes are bombing Kurdish villages. Human Rights Watch reports that in mid-August, Turkey officially suspended the European Convention on Human Rights for the Kurdish provinces, eliminating these marginal protections with no protest from any Western government, while the army "stepped up the village burnings and deportations." Censorship is so extreme that the facts remain obscure, and lacking ideological utility, are of no interest in any event.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT18" HREF="#FN18">18</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Plainly, we have here a man who can be expected to "breathe light" into the problems of the Middle East. If we prefer the facts, we may derive further conclusions about the New World Order.


<H3>The Background to the War</H3>

<P>Prior to August 2, 1990, the US and its allies found Saddam Hussein an attractive partner. In 1980, they helped prevent UN reaction to Iraq's attack on Iran, which they supported throughout. At the time, Iraq was a Soviet client, but Reagan, Thatcher and Bush recognized Saddam Hussein as "our kind of guy" and induced him to switch sides. In 1982, Reagan removed Iraq from the list of states that sponsor terror, permitting it to receive enormous credits for the purchase of US exports while the US became a major market for its oil. By 1987, Iraq praised Washington for its "positive efforts" in the Gulf while expressing disappointment over Soviet refusal to join the tilt towards Iraq (Tariq Aziz). US intervention was instrumental in enabling Iraq to gain the upper hand in the war. Western corporations took an active role in building up Iraq's military strength, notably its weapons of mass destruction. Reagan and Bush regularly intervened to block congressional censure of their friend's atrocious human rights record, strenuously opposing any actions that might interfere with profits for US corporations or with Iraq's military build-up.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT19" HREF="#FN19">19</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Britain was no different. When Saddam was reported to have gassed thousands of Kurds at Halabja, the White House intervened to block any serious congressional reaction and not one member of the governing Conservative Party was willing to join a left-labor condemnation in Parliament. Both governments now profess outrage over the crime, and denounce those who did protest for appeasing their former comrade, while basking in media praise for their high principle.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT20" HREF="#FN20">20</A></FONT></SUP> It was, of course, understood that Saddam Hussein was one of the world's most savage tyrants. But he was "our gangster," joining a club in which he could find congenial associates. Repeating a familiar formula, Geoffrey Kemp, head of the Middle East section in the National Security Council under Reagan, observed that "We weren't really that naive. We knew that he was an SOB, but he was our SOB."

<P>By mid-July 1990, our SOB was openly moving troops towards Kuwait and waving a fist at his neighbors. Relations with Washington remained warm. Bush intervened once again to block congressional efforts to deny loan guarantees to Iraq. On August 1, while intelligence warned of the impending invasion, Bush approved the sale of advanced data transmission equipment to his friendly SOB. In the preceding two weeks, licenses had been approved for $4.8 million in advanced technology products, including computers for the Ministry of Industry and Military Industrialization, for the Saad 16 research center that was later destroyed by bombing on grounds that it was developing rockets and poison gas, and for another plant that was repeatedly bombed as a chemical weapons factory. The State Department indicated to Saddam that it had no serious objection to his rectifying border disputes with Kuwait, or intimidating other oil producers to raise the oil price to $25 a barrel or more. For reasons that remain unexplained, Kuwait's response to Iraqi pressures and initiatives was defiant and contemptuous.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT21" HREF="#FN21">21</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The available evidence can be read in various ways. The most conservative (and, in my view, most plausible) reading is that Saddam misunderstood the signals as a "green light" to take all of Kuwait, possibly with the intention of setting up a puppet government behind which he would keep effective power (on the model of the US in Panama and many other cases), possibly as a bargaining chip to achieve narrower ends, possibly with broader goals. That was unacceptable: no independent force is permitted to gain significant control over the world's major energy reserves, which are to be in the hands of the US and its clients.

<P>Saddam's record was already so sordid that the conquest of Kuwait added little to it, but that action was a crime that matters: the crime of independence. Torture, tyranny, aggression, slaughter of civilians are all acceptable by US-UK standards, but not stepping on our toes. The standard policies were then set into motion.


<H3>Deterring Iraqi Democracy</H3>

<P>Throughout these years, Iraqi democratic forces opposing Bush's comrade were rebuffed by the White House, once again in February 1990, when they sought support for a call for parliamentary democracy. In the same month, the British Foreign Office impeded their efforts to condemn Iraqi terror, for fear that they might harm Anglo-Iraqi relations. Two months later, after the execution of London <CITE>Observer</CITE> correspondent Farzad Bazoft and other Iraqi atrocities, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd reiterated the need to maintain good relations with Iraq. Iraqi Kurds received the same treatment. In mid-August, Kurdish leader Jalal Talabani flew to Washington to seek support for guerrilla operations against Saddam's regime. Neither Pentagon nor State Department officials would speak to him, even though such operations would surely have weakened Iraq's forces in Kuwait; he was rebuffed again in March 1991. The reason, presumably, was concern over the sensibilities of the Turkish "defender of civilized values," who looked askance at Kurdish resistance.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT22" HREF="#FN22">22</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>It is a very revealing fact that the Iraqi democratic opposition was not only ignored by Washington but also scrupulously excluded from the media, throughout the Gulf crisis.  That is easily explained when we hear what they had to say.

<P>On the eve of the air war, the German press published a statement of the "Iraqi Democratic Group," conservative in orientation ("liberal," in the European sense), reiterating its call for the overthrow of Saddam Hussein but also opposing "any foreign intervention in the Near East," criticizing US "policies of aggression" in the Third World and its intention to control Middle East oil, and rejecting UN resolutions "that had as their goal the starvation of our people." The statement called for the withdrawal of US-UK troops, withdrawal of Iraqi troops from Kuwait, self-determination for the Kuwaiti people, "a peaceful settlement of the Kuwait problem, democracy for Iraq, and autonomy for Iraq-Kurdistan." A similar stand was taken by the Teheran-based Supreme Assembly of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (in a communiqu from Beirut); the Iraqi Communist Party; Mas'ud Barzani, the leader of the Kurdistan Democratic Party; and other prominent opponents of the Iraqi regime, many of whom had suffered bitterly from Saddam's atrocities. Falih `Abd al-Jabbar, an Iraqi journalist in exile in London, commented: "Although the Iraqi opposition parties have neither given up their demand for an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait nor their hope of displacing Saddam some time in the future, they believe that they will lose the moral right to oppose the present regime if they do not side with Iraq against the war." They called for reliance on sanctions, which, they argued, would prove effective.  "All the opposition parties are agreed in calling for an immediate withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait," British journalist Edward Mortimer reports, "but most are very unhappy about the military onslaught by the US-led coalition" and prefer economic and political sanctions. They also condemned the murderous bombing.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT23" HREF="#FN23">23</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>A delegation of the Kuwaiti democratic opposition in Amman in December took the same position, opposing any Western assault against Iraq. On British television, anti-Saddam Arab intellectuals in London, including the prominent Kuwaiti opposition leader Dr. Ahmed al-Khatib, were unanimous in calling for a cease-fire and for serious consideration of Saddam's February 15 peace offer. In October 1990, Dr. al-Khatib had stated that Kuwaitis "do not want a military solution" with its enormous costs for Kuwait, and strenuously opposed any military action.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT24" HREF="#FN24">24</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The silence here was deafening, and most instructive. Unlike Bush and his associates, the peace movement and Iraqi democratic opposition had always opposed Saddam Hussein. But they also opposed the quick resort to violence to undercut a peaceful resolution of the conflict. Such an outcome would have avoided the slaughter of tens of thousands of people, the destruction of two countries, harsh reprisals, an environmental catastrophe, further slaughter by the Iraqi government and the likely emergence of another murderous US-backed tyranny there. But it would not have taught the crucial lessons, already reviewed. With the mission accomplished, the disdain for Iraqi democrats continues unchanged. A European diplomat observes that "The Americans would prefer to have another Assad, or better yet, another Mubarak in Baghdad," referring to their "military-backed regimes" (dictatorships, that of Assad being particularly odious). "This may account for the fact that thus far, the administration has refused to meet with Iraqi opposition leaders in exile," Jane Friedman reports in the <CITE>Christian Science Monitor.</CITE> A diplomat from the US-run coalition says that "we will accept Saddam in Baghdad in order to have Iraq as one state," which might be interpreted as meaning: to prevent Iraqi democracy.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT25" HREF="#FN25">25</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>In mid-March, Iraqi opposition leaders alleged that the US favors a military dictatorship, insisting that "changes in the regime must come from within, from people already in power" (Leith Kubba, head of the London-based Iraqi Democratic Reform Movement). Banker Ahmed Chalabi, another prominent opposition activist, said that "the United States, covered by the fig leaf of non-interference in Iraqi affairs, is waiting for Saddam to butcher the insurgents in the hope that he can be overthrown later by a suitable officer," an attitude rooted in the US policy of "supporting dictatorships to maintain stability." Official US spokesmen confirmed that the Bush administration had not talked to any Iraqi opposition leaders and did not then intend to: "We felt that political meetings with them...would not be appropriate for our policy at this time," State Department spokesman Richard Boucher stated on March 14.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT26" HREF="#FN26">26</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>These judgments were confirmed in the following weeks. Bush had openly encouraged uprisings against Saddam Hussein, and, according to intelligence sources, had authorized the CIA in January to aid rebels -- secretly, perhaps to avoid offending his Turkish and Saudi friends. But he stood by quietly as Saddam slaughtered Shi'ites and Kurds, tacitly approving the use of helicopter gunships to massacre civilians, refusing to impede the terror or even to provide humanitarian aid to the victims. Fleeing refugees bitterly asked journalists "Where is George Bush," probably not knowing the answer: he was fishing in Florida. Turkey was accused by Kurdish leaders of blocking food shipments to starving Kurds, and later closed its borders to most of those in flight. US forces turned back people fleeing the terror in the South, and refused even to provide food and water to those who had escaped, Reuters reported, though individual soldiers did so. A senior Pentagon official said: "The bottom line here is, if you're suggesting we would stay purely for a purpose of protecting the refugees, we won't." "We are under no obligation to them," another added. Our job is to destroy, nothing more. The US and Britain barred efforts to have the UN Security Council condemn the massacre, let alone act in any way, until it was too late to matter.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT27" HREF="#FN27">27</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>So profound is Bush's commitment to the principle of noninterference that he also could lend no support to Kuwaiti democrats. His delicacy barred mention of the word "democracy" even in private communications to the Emir, officials explained. "You can't pick out one country to lean on over another," one said; never will you find the US "leaning on" Nicaragua or Cuba, for example, or moving beyond the narrowest interpretation of international law and UN initiatives.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT28" HREF="#FN28">28</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Those who find any of this strange are simply unacquainted with standard procedures and the reasons for them.


<H3>Blocking the Diplomatic Track</H3>

<P>Iraq's invasion of Kuwait fell within the range of many other recent atrocities. The regular response of the international community is condemnation, followed by sanctions and diplomatic efforts. These procedures rarely succeed, or even begin, because they are blocked by the great powers, in the past several decades, primarily the United States, with Britain second; these powers account for 80% of Security Council vetoes in the 20 years of George Bush's national prominence. Since the US and UK happened to oppose Iraq's aggression, sanctions could be invoked, with unusually high prospects for success because of their unprecedented severity and the fact that the usual violators --  the US, UK, and their allies -- would, for once, adhere to them. The likelihood of success was stressed by virtually all witnesses at the Nunn Senate Hearings (including former Defense Secretaries and chairmen of the Joint Chiefs), as well as by academic specialists on sanctions. The question whether sanctions would have worked may be idle; quite possibly they already <I>had</I> worked by late December, perhaps mid-August. That seems a reasonable interpretation of the Iraqi withdrawal proposals confirmed or released by US officials.

<P>Washington moved resolutely to bar the success of peaceful means. Following the prescriptions of the National Security Policy Review, it ensured that this "much weaker enemy" would be punished by force. On August 22, <CITE>New York Times</CITE> chief diplomatic correspondent Thomas Friedman outlined the Administration position: the "diplomatic track" must be blocked, or negotiations might "defuse the crisis" at the cost of "a few token gains" for Iraq, perhaps "a Kuwaiti island or minor border adjustments." A week later, Knut Royce revealed in <CITE>Newsday</CITE> that a proposal in just those terms had been offered by Iraq, but was dismissed by the Administration (and suppressed by the <CITE>Times,</CITE> as it quietly conceded). The proposal, regarded as "serious" and "negotiable" by a State Department Mideast expert, called for Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait in exchange for access to the Gulf (meaning control over two uninhabited mudflats that had been assigned to Kuwait in the imperial settlement, leaving Iraq landlocked) and Iraqi control of the Rumailah oil field, about 95% in Iraq, extending two miles into Kuwait over an unsettled border.

<P>Investigative reporter Robert Parry adds further details. The offer, relayed via Iraqi Deputy Foreign Minister Nizar Hamdoon, reached Washington on August 9. According to a confidential Congressional summary, it represented the views of Saddam Hussein and other Iraqi leaders. On August 10, the proposal was brought to the National Security Council, which rejected it as "already moving against policy," according to the retired Army officer who arranged the meeting. Former CIA chief Richard Helms attempted to carry the initiative further, but got nowhere. Further efforts by Hamdoon, the Iraqi Embassy in Washington, and US interlocuters elicited no response. "There was nothing in this [peace initiative] that interested the US government," Helms said. A Congressional summary, with an input from intelligence, concludes that a diplomatic solution might have been possible at that time. That we will never know. Washington feared that it was possible, and took no chances, for the reasons expressed through the <CITE>Times</CITE> diplomatic correspondent.

<P>From the outset, the US position was clear, unambiguous, and unequivocal: no outcome will be tolerated other than capitulation to force. Others continued to pursue diplomatic efforts. On January 2, US officials disclosed an Iraqi proposal to withdraw in return for agreement of an unspecified nature on the Palestinian problem and weapons of mass destruction. US officials described the offer as "interesting" because it mentioned no border issues, taking it to "signal Iraqi interest in a negotiated settlement." A State Department Mideast expert described it as a "serious prenegotiation position." The facts were again reported by Knut Royce of <CITE>Newsday,</CITE> who observed that Washington "immediately dismissed the proposal." A <CITE>Times</CITE> report the next day suggested that mere statement by the Security Council of an intention to deal with the two "linked" issues might have sufficed for complete Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait. Again, the US was taking no chances, and quashed the threat at once.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT29" HREF="#FN29">29</A></FONT></SUP> The story continued. On the eve of the air war, the US and UK announced that they would veto a French proposal for immediate Iraqi withdrawal in exchange for a meaningless Security Council statement on a possible future conference; Iraq then rejected the proposal as well. On February 15, Iraq offered to withdraw completely from Kuwait, stating that the withdrawal "should be linked" to Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories and Lebanon, in accord with UN resolutions. The Iraqi Ambassador to the UN stated that the offer was unconditional, and that the terms cited were "issues" that should be addressed, not "conditions" involving "linkage." The State Department version, published in the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> and elsewhere, mistranslated the Iraqi offer, giving the wording: "Israel must withdraw..."  Washington at once rejected the offer, and the Ambassador's comments, which were barely noted in the press, were ignored. The US insisted that Iraqi withdrawal must <I>precede</I> a cease-fire; Iraqi forces must leave their bunkers and be smashed to pieces, after which the US might consider a cease-fire. The media seemed to consider this quite reasonable.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT30" HREF="#FN30">30</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Washington's plan was to launch the ground operation on February 23. Problems arose when the Soviet Union, a day earlier, reached an agreement with Iraq to withdraw if UN resolutions would then be cancelled. The President, "having concluded that the Soviet diplomacy was getting out of hand" (as the <CITE>Times</CITE> puts it), brusquely dismissed the final Soviet-Iraq agreement, quickly changing the topic to the charge of an Iraqi "scorched-earth policy." Again, the crucial difference between the two positions had to do with timing: should Iraq withdraw one day after a cease-fire, as the Soviet-Iraqi proposal stated, or while the bombing continued, as the US demanded.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT31" HREF="#FN31">31</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Throughout, the media went along, with scarcely a false note.

<P>The record strongly supports the judgment of Reagan insider James Webb, former Navy Secretary, one of the few critics of the war to gain a public forum. In the <CITE>Wall Street Journal,</CITE> he wrote that "this administration has dealt in extremes," favoring "brute force" over other means. Bush "relentlessly maneuvered our nation into a war" that was unnecessary. He chose to turn the country into "the world's Hessians," a mercenary state paid by others while "our society reels from internal problems" that the administration refuses to address.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT32" HREF="#FN32">32</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>This record is, again, highly informative. The possibility of a negotiated settlement was excluded from the political and ideological systems with remarkable efficiency. When Republican National Committee Chairman Clayton Yeutter states that if a Democrat had been President, Kuwait would not be liberated today, few if any Democrats can respond by saying: If I had been President, Kuwait might well have been liberated long before, perhaps by August, without the disastrous consequences of your relentless drive for war. In the media, one will search far for a hint that diplomatic options might have been pursued, or even existed. The mainstream journals of opinion were no different. Those few who felt a need to justify their support for the slaughter carefully evaded these crucial issues, in Europe as well.

<P>To evaluate the importance of this service to power, consider again the situation just before the air war began. On January 9, a national poll revealed that 2/3 of the US population favored a conference on the Arab-Israeli conflict if that would lead to Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait. The question was framed to minimize a positive response, stressing that the Bush administration opposed the idea.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT33" HREF="#FN33">33</A></FONT></SUP> It is a fair guess that each person who nevertheless advocated such a settlement assumed that he or she was isolated in this opinion.  Few if any had heard any public advocacy of their position; the media had been virtually uniform in following the Washington Party Line, dismissing "linkage" (i.e., diplomacy) as an unspeakable crime, in this unique case. It is hardly likely that respondents were aware that an Iraqi proposal calling for a settlement in these terms had been released a week earlier by US officials, who found it reasonable; or that the Iraqi democratic forces, and most of the world, took the same stand.

<P>Suppose that the crucial facts had been known and the issues honestly addressed. Then the 2/3 figure would doubtless have been far higher, and it might have been possible to avoid the huge slaughter preferred by the administration, with its useful consequences: the world learns that it is to be ruled by force, the dominant role of the US in the Gulf and its control over Middle East oil are secured, and the population is diverted from the growing disaster around us. In brief, the educated classes and the media did their duty.

<P>The academic study of attitudes and beliefs cited earlier revealed that the public overwhelmingly supports the use of force to reverse illegal occupation and serious human rights abuses. But, like journalists and others who proudly proclaim this "worthy standard," they do not call for force in a host of cases that at once come to mind. They do not applaud Scud attacks on Tel Aviv, though Saddam's sordid arguments compare well enough to those of his fellow-criminal in Washington, if honestly considered; nor would they approve bombs in Washington, a missile attack on Jakarta, etc.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT34" HREF="#FN34">34</A></FONT></SUP> Why? Again, because of the triumphs of the ideological system. The facts having been consigned to their appropriate obscurity, the slogans can be trumpeted, unchallenged.


<H3>Deterring US Democracy</H3>

<P>Such examples, readily extended, illustrate the success in suppressing democracy in the United States. The ideal, long sought by the business community and the political class, is that the general population should be marginalized, each person isolated, deprived of the kinds of associations that might lead to independent thought and political action. Each must sit alone in front of the tube, absorbing its doctrinal message: trust in the Leader; ape the images of the "good life" presented by the commercials and the sitcoms; be a spectator, a consumer, a passive worker who follows orders, but not a participant in the way the world works. To achieve this goal, it has been necessary to destroy unions and other popular organizations, restrict the political system to factions of the business party, and construct a grand edifice of lies to conceal every relevant issue, whether it be Indochina, Central America, the Middle East, terrorism, the Cold War, domestic policy, ..., whatever -- so that the proper lessons are on the shelf, ready when needed.

<P>The methods have been refined over many years. The first state propaganda agency was established by the Woodrow Wilson administration. Within a few months, a largely pacifist population had been turned into a mob of warmongers, raging to destroy everything German and later backing the Wilson repression that demolished unions and independent thought. The success impressed the business and intellectual communities, leading to the doctrines of "manufacture of consent" and the elaboration of methods to reduce the general public to its proper spectator role. When the threat of popular democracy and labor organizing arose again in the 1930s, business moved quickly to destroy the virus, with great success. Labor's last real legislative victory was in 1935, and the supporting culture has largely been swept away. "Scientific methods of strike-breaking" rallied community support against the disruptive elements that interfered with the "harmony" to which "we" are devoted -- "we" being the corporate executive, the honest sober worker, the housewife, the people united in support of "Americanism." Huge media campaigns wielding vacuous slogans to dispel the danger of thought are now a staple of the ideological system. To derail concern over whether you should <I>support their policy,</I> the PR system focuses attention on whether you <I>support our troops</I> -- meaningless words, as empty as the question of whether you support the people of Iowa. That, of course, is just the point: to reduce the population to gibbering idiots, mouthing empty phrases and patriotic slogans, waving ribbons, watching gladiatorial contests and the models designed for them by the PR industry, but, crucially, not thinking or acting. A few must be trained to think and act, if only to serve the needs of the powerful; but they must be kept within the rigid constraints of the ideological system. These are the tasks of the media, journals of opinion, schools and universities.

<P>They have been accomplished with much distinction. To approach any serious question, it is first necessary to clear away mountains of ideological rubble. But the triumph is far from complete, far less so than a generation ago. Outside elite circles, the indoctrination is thin, and often is cast aside with surprising ease if people have an opportunity to think. Skepticism and disbelief are barely below the surface. Where there are even fragments of organization, many have been able to defend themselves from the ideological onslaught. The famed "gender gap" is an example. The opportunities for association and independent thought offered by the womens' movement have led to a dramatic shift in attitudes -- or, perhaps, willingness to express long-held attitudes -- over the past two decades. The same is true of church groups, solidarity organizations, and others.

<P>The political leadership and others who hail the martial virtues know well that the domestic base for intervention in the traditional mode has eroded: no more Marines chasing Sandino, or US forces marauding for years in the Mekong Delta. Either proxy forces must be used, as in the international terror networks of the Reagan-Bush years, or victory must be "rapid and decisive." And a "much weaker enemy" can be attacked only if it is first demonized and built to awesome dimensions by vast propaganda campaigns. By the same token, those who hope to narrow the options for violence and state terror must find ways to clear away the rubble under which the reality of the world has been buried. It is not an easy task, but the task of raising consciousness never is, and it has been pursued effectively under circumstances that most of us can barely imagine.


<H3>The War</H3>

<P>The war followed the script laid out for confrontations with a "much weaker enemy." A ground war was avoided. US combat casualties were on the scale of Grenada, while Iraqi military deaths are estimated by the US military at 1-200,000, killed from a safe distance. The victors bulldozed corpses into mass graves, in violation of the Geneva Conventions to which they appeal when some interest is served. But the laws of war are as relevant as they were in earlier days, when the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> cheerily described how helicopter gunships would attack the "dazed and bleeding people" surrounding B-52 bomb craters in Vietnam and "put them out of their misery," honoring the law that soldiers unable to fight "shall in all circumstances be treated humanely."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT35" HREF="#FN35">35</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>In a briefing, General Schwartzkopf observed that during the Grenada invasion, the Cubans fought harder than expected -- referring to the several dozen paramilitary construction workers who resisted the assault of 6000 elite US forces after Washington had ignored Cuba's announcement that they would not fire unless attacked, and its call for a peaceful resolution. This time, the heroic General explained, we would take no chances. The tactic was to pulverize the Third World peasant army -- hiding in the sand, immobile, and defenseless -- after months of disinformation about its artillery, sophisticated defenses, chemical weapons, and other fantastic capacities, later conceded to be largely fakery. When the enemy was utterly demoralized, US forces cut off escape, the Air Force slaughtered those attempting to flee (including Asian workers and Kuwaiti hostages, BBC reported),<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT36" HREF="#FN36">36</A></FONT></SUP> and troops were sent it to pick up the pieces -- though elite Iraqi units were allowed to move on to crush later revolts with savage terror, in accord with the US aim of reconstructing something rather like the friendly regime of the pre-August 1990 period, but now with firmer guarantees of obedience to the master.

<P>The air war had already reduced Iraq to a "pre-industrial age," creating "near apocalyptic" conditions, a UN survey reported. The air attack was aimed at civilian targets, called "military" for the purpose: water, sewage, and power systems, bridges and infrastructure generally. The results, as expected, were the effective destruction of the health system so that limbs have to be sawed off without anesthesia among other harrowing scenes in what remains of hospitals; mounting deaths from disease and lack of food and water, with huge increase in infant diarrheal infections and other serious diseases; water down to 5% of normal supply; food rations at 1000 calories with further crises impending; and the likelihood of major epidemics from what amounts to biological warfare. The <CITE>Times</CITE> reported that the US opposes any "premature relaxation" of these conditions, insisting that the civilian population be held hostage in the expectation that if they suffer enough, they might remove Saddam Hussein. This is apart from the tens of thousands of civilians killed, the destruction of four hospitals, thousands of homes and other civilian structures by bombing, and other goals readily -- and of course heroically -- achieved when the the "much weaker enemy" is entirely defenseless.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT37" HREF="#FN37">37</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Had the diplomatic track that Washington feared been successfully pursued, Kuwait too would have been spared the war and the Iraqi terror, which, according to reports, rapidly increased in the final days. An environmental catastrophe would also have been averted. In the small print, the <CITE>Times</CITE> noted that according to Pentagon officials, "the burning of Kuwait's oil fields might have been a defensive action by Iraq, which appeared to be anticipating imminent attack by allied ground forces." While Iraq created the largest oil spill, the one that threatened the desalination plant at Safaniya in Saudi Arabia probably resulted from US bombing, US military officials said. A Pentagon official added that the Iraqi oil spill might have been aimed at the water sources for US troops, in retaliation for US destruction of Kuwait's major desalination plant just before. The prime responsibility for the Gulf tragedy lies on the shoulders of Saddam Hussein; but he is not without his partners in crime, nor are his crimes unique.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT38" HREF="#FN38">38</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Some commentators expressed qualms about the savagery of the final slaughter, but a look at history should have relieved their surprise. When violence is cost-free, all bars are down. During the Indochina war, there were constraints on bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong, or dikes in North Vietnam, because of fear of a Chinese or Soviet reaction and the political cost elsewhere. But in the southern sectors of North Vietnam, or elsewhere in Indochina, no one important cared, and the rule was that "anything goes." The Pentagon Papers reveal extensive planning about the bombing of the North, because of potential costs to the US; the far more devastating bombing of the South, begun years earlier and including major war crimes, is passed over with little attention.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT39" HREF="#FN39">39</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The same was true of World War II. At the end, Japan was defenseless, therefore demolished at will. Tokyo was removed from the list of atom bomb targets because it was "practically rubble" so that an attack would not demonstrate the bomb's power.  Many believe that the war ended with the atom bomb. Not so. In the official US Air Force history, we read that General Arnold "wanted as big a finale as possible," and, with management skills that compare to Stormin' Norman's, assembled over 1000 planes to bomb Japan after Nagasaki, killing thousands of people and dropping leaflets saying "Your Government has surrendered. The war is over!" Truman announced Japan's surrender before the last planes returned. Japan was prostrate, so why not? As the Korean war ground on, the Air Force could locate no more targets.  Therefore, as an official US Air Force study records, it attacked North Korean dams, leading to such stirring sights as a "flash flood [that] scooped clean 27 miles of valley below," while 75% of the water supply for rice production was wiped out and the enemy suffered "the destruction of their chief sustenance -- rice." "The Westerner can little conceive the awesome meaning which the loss of this staple food commodity has for the Asian," the study explains: "starvation and slow death, ...more feared than the deadliest plague. Hence the show of rage, the flare of violent tempers, and the avowed threats of reprisals when bombs fell on five irrigation dams." The threats of reprisal were empty, and there were no political costs, so these war crimes joined the long list of others compiled with impunity by the powerful, who never fail to strike impressive poses as they call for war crimes trials -- for others.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT40" HREF="#FN40">40</A></FONT></SUP>


<H3>The Political Culture</H3>

<P>The published record tells us more about the political culture in the United States and the West generally. As noted, the possibility of a peaceful resolution was virtually banned from discussion. When George Bush thundered that <I>There Will Be No Negotiations,</I> a hundred editorials and news reports would laud him for "going the last mile for peace" in "extraordinary efforts at diplomacy." Democratic forces in Iraq, with their unwanted message, were also successfully barred. Popular opposition to the war in most of the world was sporadically reported, but primarily as a problem: Can the friendly dictatorships control their populations while we gain our ends by force? Even among those who did not exalt the "martial values," the totalitarian commitments were scarcely below the surface.

<P>In the US, dissident voices were effectively excluded from the mainstream, as is the norm; and while the media elsewhere were far more open, support for the war on the part of the educated classes in the industrial democracies was so overwhelming that the effects were slight. Strikingly, no concern was voiced over the glaringly obvious fact that <I>no official reason was ever offered for going to war</I> -- no reason, that is, that could not be instantly refuted by a literate teenager. That is the very hallmark of a totalitarian political culture.

<P>The matter merits a closer look. After various failed efforts, one single official reason was offered for war, repeated in a litany by George Bush and his acolytes: "There can be no reward for aggression. Nor will there by any negotiation. Principle cannot be compromised."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT41" HREF="#FN41">41</A></FONT></SUP> Accordingly, there can be no diplomacy, merely an ultimatum -- capitulate or die -- followed by the quick resort to violence.

<P>Presented with this argument, the educated classes did not collapse in ridicule, but solemnly intoned the Party Line, expressing their awe and admiration for Bush's high principles. One would have to search far for the reaction that would be immediate on the part of any rational and minimally informed person: True, principle cannot be compromised, but since George Bush is a leading supporter of aggression and always has been, the principle invoked is not his, or his government's, or that of any other state. And it follows that no reason has been given at all for rejecting negotiations in favor of violence.

<P>The specific words just quoted happen to be Bush's response to the Iraqi withdrawal proposal released by US officials on January 2. But the stance was maintained throughout. Intellectuals asked no questions, finding nothing to challenge in the farcical official pronouncements and the doctrine clearly implied: the world is to to be ruled by force.

<P>The conclusion is brilliantly clear: no official reason was offered for the war, and the educated classes suppressed the fact with near unanimity. We must look elsewhere to find the reasons for the war -- a question of great significance for any citizen, though not for the guardians of doctrinal purity, who must bar this quest.

<P>The methods adopted were enlightening. Those who had the indecency to demolish the official justifications were accused of demanding "moral purity," opposing any response to Iraq's aggression by states that had been "inconsistent" in the past (in fact, they had consistently pursued their own interests, generally supporting aggression for this reason). Returning to the realm of rational discourse, these miscreants were pointing out that war without stated reason is a sign of totalitarian values, and citizens who reject these values will have to turn elsewhere to discover the real reasons. In the mainstream, they would find very little.

<P>Outside official circles, the standard justification for war was that sanctions would not work and that it was unfair to allow the Kuwaitis to suffer on. Some held that debate over sanctions was a standoff, perhaps irresoluble. By the same logic, the bombing of numerous other countries can at once be justified by mere assertion that nothing else will put an end to aggression, annexation, and human rights abuses. Transparently, all of this is nonsense, even if we ignore the evidence that sanctions had already worked. Indisputably, the burden of proof lies on those who call for the use of force, a heavy burden that was never met, or even seriously faced.

<P>One could not seriously argue that the suffering of the victims in this case was more extreme than in numerous others for which force has never been proposed. Nor is there any merit to the argument that this case was different because of the annexation: putting aside the US-UK response to other cases of annexation, no less horrifying, the drive towards war continued unchanged after Iraqi withdrawal offers that the US did not risk pursuing. The claim that a peaceful settlement would not have destroyed Saddam's warmaking capacity is no more persuasive. Apart from the broader consequences of such an argument if taken seriously, the obvious procedure for eliminating this capacity would have been to explore the possibilities for regional disarmament and security arrangements (proposed by Iraq, rejected by the US, well before the invasion of Kuwait); and after his negotiated withdrawal from Kuwait, to refrain from providing Saddam with lavish high technology assistance for his warmaking capacity, surely a possibility if the West could overcome its greed in this sole instance. Other arguments are equally weighty.

<P>In one of the more serious efforts to address some of the questions, Timothy Garton Ash asserts in the <CITE>New York Review</CITE> that while sanctions were possible in dealing with South Africa or Communist East Europe, Saddam Hussein is different. That concludes the argument. We now understand why it was proper to pursue "quiet diplomacy" while our South African friends caused over $60 billion in damage and 1.5 million deaths from 1980 to 1988 in the neighboring states -- putting aside South Africa and Namibia, and the preceding decade. They are basically decent folk, like us and the Communist tyrants. Why? No answer is offered here, but a partial one is suggested by Nelson Mandela, who condemns the hypocrisy and prejudice of the highly selective response to the crimes of the "brown-skinned" Iraqis. The same thought comes to mind when the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> assures us that "the world" is united against Saddam Hussein, the most hated man in "the world" -- the world, that is, minus its darker faces.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT42" HREF="#FN42">42</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The emergence of Western racism with such stunning clarity is worth notice. It is an understandable consequence of the end of the Cold War. For 70 years, it has been possible to disguise traditional practices as "defense against the Soviets," generally a sham, now lost as a pretext. We return, then, to earlier days when the New York press explained that "we must go on slaughtering the natives in English fashion, and taking what muddy glory lies in the wholesale killing til they have learned to respect our arms. The more difficult task of getting them to respect our intentions will follow."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT43" HREF="#FN43">43</A></FONT></SUP> In fact, deprived of the benefits of our form of civilization, they understood our intentions well enough, and still do.


<H3>The Contours of the New World Order</H3>

<P>Despite basic continuities, there have been changes in the international system. It is by now a truism that the world is economically "tripolar." The collapse of Soviet tyranny adds new dimensions: much of Eastern Europe can be restored to its former status as a quasi-colonial dependency of the West; new pretexts are needed for intervention; there is no longer any deterrent to the use of military force by the United States. But though it has a virtual monopoly of military force, the US no longer has the economic base to impose "order and stability" (meaning, a proper respect for the masters) in the Third World. Therefore, as the business press has been advising, the US must become a "mercenary state," paid for its services by German-led continental Europe and Japan, and relying on the flow of capital from Gulf oil production, which it will dominate. The same is true of its British lieutenant, also facing serious domestic problems, but with a "sturdy national character" and proper tradition. John Keegan, a prominent British military historian and defense commentator for the right-wing <CITE>Daily Telegraph,</CITE> outlines the common view succinctly: "The British are used to over 200 years of expeditionary forces going overseas, fighting the Africans, the Chinese, the Indians, the Arabs. It's just something the British take for granted," and the war in the Gulf "rings very, very familiar imperial bells with the British."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT44" HREF="#FN44">44</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The financial editor of the conservative <CITE>Chicago Tribune</CITE> has been stressing these themes with particular clarity. We must be "willing mercenaries," paid for our ample services by our rivals, using our "monopoly power" in the "security market" to maintain "our control over the world economic system." We should run a global protection racket, he advises, selling "protection" to other wealthy powers who will pay us a "war premium." This is Chicago, where the words are understood: if someone bothers you, you call on the mafia to break their bones. And if you fall behind in your premium, your health may suffer too.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT45" HREF="#FN45">45</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The use of force to control the Third World is only a last resort. Economic weapons remain a more efficient instrument. Some of the newer mechanisms can be seen in the Uruguay Round negotiations, now in disarray because of conflicts among the rich, but sure to be revived in one or another form. Western powers call for liberalization when that is in their interest; and for enhanced protection of domestic economic actors, when <I>that</I> is in their interest. The major concern of the US in the GATT negotiations was not agricultural policy, as much of the coverage suggested, but rather the "new themes," as they are called: guarantees for "intellectual property rights" (ranging from pop culture to software and patents), removal of constraints on services and investment, and so on; a mixture of liberalization and protectionism, determined by the interests of the powerful. The effect of these measures would be to restrict Third World governments to a police function to control their working classes and superfluous population, while transnational corporations gain free access to their resources and monopolize new technology and global investment and production -- and of course are granted the central planning, allocation, production and distribution functions denied to governments, which suffer from the defect that they might fall under the baleful influence of the rabble. These facts have not been lost on Third World commentators, who have been protesting eloquently and mightily. But their voices are as welcome here as those of Iraqi democrats.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT46" HREF="#FN46">46</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The US will try to establish more firmly its own regional dominance, exploiting "free trade" to secure super-cheap labor in Mexico, the Caribbean, and other dependencies, while Canadian resources are taken over and its industry and cultural independence decline. The press failed to give Bush sufficient credit for his achievements in his Fall 1990 tour of Latin America. Mexico was induced to allow US oil companies new access to its resources, a long-sought policy goal. US companies will now be able "to help Mexico's nationalized oil company," as the <CITE>Wall Street Journal</CITE> prefers to construe the matter. Our fondest wish for many years has been to help our little brown brothers, and at last the ignorant peons will allow us to cater to their needs.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT47" HREF="#FN47">47</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The population at home must also be controlled, and diverted from the growing domestic crises. The basic means have already been described, including periodic campaigns against "much weaker enemies": Cuba is a likely next target, perhaps in time for the next election, if illegal economic warfare, terrorism, intimidation of others to bar normal relations, and other devices can set the stage.

<P>In the Middle East, the US is now well placed to impose its will. The traditional strategic conception has been that the US and its British lieutenant should maintain effective power but indirect control along lines explained by Lord Curzon in the days of British dominance: it is preferable to rule behind an "Arab facade," with "absorption" of the quasi-colony "veiled by constitutional fictions as a protectorate, a sphere of influence, a buffer State, and so on." But we must never run the risk of "losing control," as John Foster Dulles and many others warned.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT48" HREF="#FN48">48</A></FONT></SUP> The local managers of Gulf oil riches are to be protected by regional enforcers, preferably non-Arab: Turkey, Israel, Pakistan and Iran, which perhaps can be restored to the fold. Bloody tyrants of the Hafez el-Assad variety, with his minority-based dictatorship, may be allowed to take part, possibly even Egypt if it can be purchased, though the regime is not brutal enough to be reliable. US and British force remain on call if needed, and can now be freely deployed, with the Soviet deterrent gone. The US will seek some agreement among its clients, and might even consider an international conference, if it can be properly managed. As Henry Kissinger insisted, Europe and Japan must be kept out of the diplomacy, but the USSR might be tolerated on the assumption that it will be obedient in its current straits.

<P>As for the Palestinians, the US can now move towards the solution outlined by James Baker well before the Gulf crisis: Jordan is the Palestinian state; the occupied territories are to be ruled in accord with the basic guidelines of the Israeli government, with Palestinians permitted to collect local taxes in Nablus; their political representatives will be chosen for them, with the PLO excluded; and "free elections" will be held under Israeli military control with the Palestinian leadership in prison camps. The reality will be masked behind such slogans as "territorial compromise" and "land for peace," interpreted in accord with traditional Labor Party rejectionism, always favored by the US over the Likud variant: Israel will take what it wants in the territories, leaving the surplus population stateless or under Jordanian administration. New excuses will be devised for old policies, which will be hailed as generous and forthcoming.

<P>Economic development for the Palestinians had always been barred, while their land and water were taken. The Labor Party leadership advised that the Palestinians should be given the message: "You shall continue to live like dogs, and whoever wishes, may leave" (Moshe Dayan, more pro-Palestinian than most).<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT49" HREF="#FN49">49</A></FONT></SUP> The advice was followed, though the grim story was largely suppressed here. Palestinians had been permitted to serve the Israeli economy as virtual slave labor, but this interlude is passing. The recent curfew administered a further blow to the Palestinian economy. The victors can now proceed with the policy articulated in February 1989 by Yitzhak Rabin of the Labor Party, then Defense Secretary, when he informed Peace Now leaders of his satisfaction with the US-PLO dialogue, meaningless discussions to divert attention while Israel suppresses the Intifada by force. The Palestinians "will be broken," Rabin promised, reiterating the prediction of Israeli Arabists 40 years earlier: the Palestinians will "be crushed," will die or "turn into human dust and the waste of society, and join the most impoverished classes in the Arab countries." Or they will leave, while Russian Jews, now barred from the US by policies designed to deny them a free choice, flock to an expanded Israel, leaving the diplomatic issues moot, as the Baker-Shamir-Peres plan envisaged.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT50" HREF="#FN50">50</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>These are some of the contours of the planned New World Order that come into view as the beguiling rhetoric is lifted away.

<H1>Gulf War Pullout</H1>

<P>Noam Chomsky and Michael Albert<BR>
<CITE>Z Magazine,</CITE> February 1991

<H3>The "Logic" of War</H3>

<P>To effectively combat war in the Gulf we have to understand its motives. Bush is seeking to get Iraq out of Kuwait. Possibly he is seeking to reduce Iraq to rubble. But that is not the whole story.

<P>Hundreds of U.S. bombers are not "storming" Iraq to maintain cheap oil. (1) The cost of more expensive oil would be much less than the cost of the military operation. (2) Oil prices have a marked-regulated cap anyhow. If oil producers raise prices too high for too long, users drift away which is self-defeating for oil rich countries. (3) Insofar as high oil prices cause problems to industrialized economies, Europe and Japan are more vulnerable than the U.S., so relative to these countries higher oil prices often <I>help</I> our economy at a time of its threatened dissolution.

<P>Fleets of U.S. helicopters are not "storming" Iraq to honor Kuwait's national sovereignty. U.S. history is a near continuous chronicle of violating other countries' national sovereignty for even less compelling reasons than those Saddam Hussein offers to rationalize his militarism. For example, Kuwait's oil policies were certainly more damaging to Iraq's economy than Panama's policies were to the U.S. economy. No U.S. elected official or mainstream media commentator has even hinted that our invasion of Panama was just as much a violation of national sovereignty as Hussein's invasion of Kuwait. Respect for national sovereignty is an after-the-fact rationalization of Desert Storm, not a motive.

<P>U.S. troops are not "storming" Iraq because we fear Hitlerite expansionism. Iraq is only a local power, not pre-World War II Germany. Iraq just spent the 1980s <I>failing</I> to conquer Iran despite U.S. support.

<P>The real reason for U.S. opposition to Iraqi occupation of Kuwait is not to keep oil prices low, but to keep Washington, Wall Street, and their allies in charge of setting oil prices. We are fighting to maintain and even enlarge one of our few continuing claims to international economic clout: control of oil prices. The Bush administration and the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> alike view the Mideast as an extension of Texas. It is "our oil," not theirs. The U.S. oil posture is not a sober defense of countries dependent on oil. It is a greedy offensive that pursues U.S. oil advantage. Most countries, particularly Third World countries, suffer horribly for these policies.

<P>But fulfilling our imperial need to control the "oil card" requires only that Hussein be pushed out of Kuwait. A second question therefore arises. Why not let diplomacy and sanctions push Hussein out? Why escalate the war?

<P>The answer is at the heart of understanding the U.S. role in the so-called "new world order." George Bush wants Hussein out of Kuwait, yes. But he does not want UN activism, international sanctions, and multilateral diplomacy credited with causing withdrawal. From Bush's perspective a diplomatic solution would be as bad as Hussein's interference in the first place. Diplomatic success would undercut the efficacy of U.S. military interventionism, now, and well into the future. And it would add powerful fuel to calls for a "peace dividend" and conversion here in the U.S..

<P>On the other hand, the early dispatch of hundreds of thousands of U.S. troops and immense firepower allowed Bush to enter what he undoubtedly saw as a "win/win" game. If Hussein had withdrawn Bush would have claimed he did so due to our military threat, thus establishing the logic of continued military spending to maintain peace. Now, the U.S. will forcibly annihilate Hussein, again evidencing the necessity for military might. The goal of our drive to war is to maintain the region's effective colonization <I>while re-legitimating militarism.</I> Now Secretary of Defense Cheney will argue not only for increased conventional military expenditures, but also for nuclear and star wars expenditures to forestall future Third World conflicts and/or smash future dictators who stray from doing our bidding.  Desert Storm is, therefore, also a war against the redistribution of domestic wealth and power than conversion away from militarism implies. It is a war against Iraq, but also a war against the poor in our own country.

<P>For years the U.S. has been the biggest economic power and has shared contested military dominance with the Soviet Union. Now we are alone at the top of the military heap with the biggest, best, and most numerous weapons of every conceivable type.  Moreover, our economy is losing its ability to coerce international obedience. The U.S. is climbing down the ladder of economic influence as U.S. military stature rises without limit.  Big guns and fewer dollars suggest a warfare state hiring out as the world's enforcer. Now we fight Exxon's wars <I>and</I> anyone else's, as long as they pay the proper fees, either because they want to or, if necessary, because we force them to. Have gun will travel. Destination: a warrior state domestically and internationally.

<P>The first battle over this scenario is unfolding now in the Mideast, as well as here at home. Will militarism be re- legitimated or will conversion gain momentum as a policy alternative? To reverse Bush's war scenario social movements must explain the underlying forces compelling Bush's violence and galvanize the deep-rooted and sustained opposition needed to stop it.


<H3>Questions and Answers</H3>

<P>1. Does the U.S. oppose aggression? No.

<UL>
<LI>Aggression is fine if it's in U.S. interests. It's bad only if it's opposed to U.S. interests. The U.S. invaded Panama and imposed a puppet regime still under U.S. control. The world objected so we vetoed two UN Security Council resolutions.

<LI>Turkey invaded northern Cyprus, broke it up, killed two thousand people, tried to destroy relics of Greek civilization, drove out 200,000 people. That was fine. Turkey is our ally.

<LI>Israel attacked Lebanon, killed about 20,000 people, bombarded the capital, and still occupies southern Lebanon. The U.S. vetoed a series of UN Security Council resolutions to terminate that aggression. Israel holds on to the occupied territories. It has annexed some of them. Fine. The U.S. supports Israel.

<LI>Morocco invaded the Western Sahara, annexed it. The U.S. thinks that's fine.

<LI>Indonesia invaded East Timor. Two hundred thousand killed. The worst slaughter relative to the population since the Holocaust. The U.S. gives them aid.

<LI>Iraq attacked Iran. The U.S. assisted them. Iraq gassed the Kurds in the north of Iraq. Fine. After all, the Turks are having problems with the Kurds too and the Turks are our ally.

<LI>Iraq invades Kuwait. Outrage. Cries of Hitler reborn. Send 400,000 troops. Bomb Baghdad.

<LI>The United States can claim it's opposed to aggression on ABC News without ridicule because we have a disciplined intellectual class who look the other way and/or lie as a matter of course. In the Third World, however, the claim is seen as ludicrous. People there consider the U.S. the major violator of the principle that aggression is wrong.
</UL>

<P>2. Does the U.S. oppose proliferation of super-weapons? No.

<UL>
<LI>In April 1990, Saddam Hussein, then still the U.S.'s friend and ally, offered to destroy his chemical and biological weapons if Israel agreed to destroy its non-conventional weapons--- including its nuclear weapons. The State Department welcomed Hussein's offer to destroy his own arsenal, but rejected the link "to other issues or weapons systems."

<LI>Acknowledgment of the existence of Israeli nuclear weapons would raise the question why all U.S. aid to Israel is not illegal under 1970s congressional legislation that bars aid to any country engaged in clandestine nuclear weapons development.

<LI>In December 1990, speaking at a joint press conference with Secretary of State Baker, then Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze proposed a nuclear-free zone in the Middle East if Iraq withdraws form Kuwait. Baker gave "qualified support," the press observed, but "carefully avoided using the words nuclear-free zone" -- for the reason just noted.

<LI>A week later, Iraq offered to "scrap chemical and mass destruction weapons if Israel was also prepared to do so," Reuters reported. The offer seems to have passed in silence here. Weapons proliferation for our allies -- including Iraq before August 2 -- is fine.

<LI>Iraq's more recent call for "the banning of all weapons of mass destruction in the region" as part of a negotiated settlement of its withdrawal from Kuwait evoked no Western support.
</UL>

<P>3. So what <I>is</I> Bush concerned about? Domination.

<UL>
<LI>Iraq violated a fundamental principle of world affairs -- that the energy reserves of the Middle East have to be firmly in the hands of U.S. energy corporations and trusted U.S. clients like Saudi Arabia's elites.

<LI>This means Mideast populations do not really benefit from their own resource, but "so what," says Bush. The West benefits because Saudi Arabia, the Emirates, and Qatar are basically sectors of London and New York. The U.S. government doesn't care if the Saudi elite administers oil prices because that's like having it done on Wall Street.

<LI>The U.S. does care if an independent Arab nationalist threatens to use the resources for domestic purposes. The U.S. opposes that kind of behavior anywhere in the world. That is why we "destroy cities to save them."

<LI>The State Department says Mideast oil is a "stupendous source of strategic power" and "one of the greatest prizes in world history." So what if it's in the Mideast?

<LI>In Iran in 1953 we overthrew a nationalist parliamentary regime. Now we threaten a murderous tyrant's regime, although Hussein was just as much a murderous tyrant before August 2, when we supported him because doing so furthered U.S. interests.
</UL>

<P>4. Why does Bush oppose negotiations? They might work.

<UL>
<LI>The U.S. is <I>usually</I> against diplomacy. If the U.S. can establish force as the way to rule the world, the U.S. wins because it's way ahead in force. If diplomacy succeeds, it delegitimates militarism, reduces the relevance of military might and increases the relevance of diplomacy.

<LI>This is also why the U.S. adamantly opposes linkage between Kuwait and the West Bank. The U.S. supports linkage when it benefits us. But in this case we're against linkage, and the reason is not just because Israel is our ally, but because linkage is a step toward diplomatically resolving the Gulf <I>and</I> Arab-Israeli crises. The U.S. opposes a <I>diplomatic</I> settlement of either crisis and therefore certainly opposes a joint diplomatic settlement of both of them.

<LI>When Bush sent 400,000 troops instead of 15,000, which could have been just as effective in preventing further Iraqi aggression, he did it to scuttle negotiations and leave only military might as the arbiter. His worst nightmare is a negotiated solution that would legitimate the rule of international law rather than U.S. power.
</UL>

<P>5. What is the New World Order all about? Same as the old, with an ominous new wrinkle.

<UL>
<LI>In the London <CITE>Financial Times</CITE> of November 21, 1990, a respected commentator describes the Gulf crisis as a "watershed event in U.S. international relations," which will be seen in history as having "turned the U.S. military into an internationally financed public good." In the 1990s, he continues, "there is no realistic alternative [to] the U.S. military assuming a more explicitly mercenary role than it has played in the past."

<LI>The financial editor of the <CITE>Chicago Tribune</CITE> recently put the point less delicately: we must exploit our "virtual monopoly in the security marked...as a lever to gain funds and economic concessions" from Germany and Japan. The U.S. has "cornered the West's security marked" and will therefore be "the world's rent-a-cops."

<LI>Some will call us "Hessians," he continues, but "that's a terribly demeaning phrase for a proud, well-trained, well-financed and well-respected military" and whatever anyone may say, "we should be able to pound our fists on a few desks" in Japan and Europe, and "extract a fair price for our considerable services," demanding that our rivals "buy our bonds at cheap rates, or keep the dollar propped up, or better yet, pay cash directly into our Treasury." "We could change this role" of enforcer, he concludes, "but with it would go much of our control over the world economic system."
</UL>

<P>6. Why is Bush so eager to wage war? Momentum and preference!

<UL>
<LI>Having sent a gigantic military force to ensure that any Gulf resolution would be military, Bush left himself few options. Either Hussein would withdraw, with or without concessions, or we would bomb him out. Bush could not maintain so high a level of force indefinitely nor withdraw without a resolution of the crisis.

<LI>But Bush has shown that he actually favored war. Why was he so eager to start a conflagration that could endanger oil supplies, our place in the Mideast, and international alliances -- all things he certainly holds dear?

<LI>The answer has to be that there is something about the effects of war that Bush finds desirable. In the "rubble" he wants to  "bounce" in Baghdad, Bush sees a prize worth struggling for.

<LI>What could it be? Peace? No. Justice? No. Stability? No. So what?

<LI>Bush is seeking the legitimation of war, the end of the "peace dividend," and the elevation of the U.S. to the status of World Mercenary Police, thus ensuring years more of U.S. international domination even as our economy flounders. <I>That's his preferred scenario.</I>

<LI>Additionally, many CEOs and other influential economic and political figures fear a serious collapse of the U.S. economy. To push up the price of oil dramatically and ensure that the super revenues are then invested in U.S. banks is, they think, one way to avert this collapse. They do not care if this approach will also mean blood, gore, pain, retribution, and hate for years to come.
</UL>

<P>7. What will be the results of war? Rivers of blood.

<UL>
<LI>If the U.S. military is not curtailed, tens of thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands or even a million Arab lives will be lost.

<LI>Thousands and perhaps tens of thousands of U.S. lives will be lost.

<LI>Countless Third World lives will be lost via inflated oil prices and international economic turmoil.

<LI>There will be world wide economic recession. Mideast destabilization with unknown repercussions. Increased nightmares for Palestinians. Possible disaster for Israel. Possible ecological devastation.

<LI>The peace dividend will be reduced or lost. Military expenditures will be reenlarged.

<LI>The Hessianization of the U.S. and subordination of international affairs to U.S. mercenary might will proceed.

<LI>A new "enemy," the Moslem world, will help scare the U.S. public into tolerating outrageous defense appropriations.

<LI>And, if all goes as planned, U.S. corporate officials and state policy-makers will continue to oversee vast wealth and unfettered power -- the real motive for U.S. intervention in the first place.
</UL>

<P>8. Why does the U.S. oppose linkage? Fear of isolation.

<UL>
<LI>There has long been a broad international consensus on a political settlement of this conflict. The U.S. and Israel have opposed it and have been isolated in this rejectionism, as numerous lopsided General Assembly votes (most recently 151-3) indicate.

<LI>President Bush likes to tell us how James Baker has labored for peace, but remains silent about the terms of the famed Baker plan, whose basic principles ban an "additional Palestinian state"; bar any "change in the status of Judea, Samaria, and Gaza other than in accordance with the basic guidelines of the [Israeli] Government," preclude any meaningful Palestinian self-determination; reject negotiations with the PLO, thus denying Palestinians the right to choose their own political representation; and call for "free elections" under Israeli military rule.

<LI>Regarding the Palestinian question, it is therefore the world against George Bush and his predecessors. For this reason, since long before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait the U.S. has consistently opposed an international conference on the Middle East.

<LI>Such a conference would lead to pressures for a just political settlement that the U.S. rejects, since by force they can maintain an unjust situation. For the same reasons the U.S. has vetoed Security Council resolutions calling for a political settlement and blocked other diplomatic initiatives for the past 20 years.
</UL>

<P>9. Why oppose war in the Gulf? It's wrong.

<UL>
<LI>Some liberals oppose a Gulf war on the grounds it will be too expensive. Usually they mean lost stability, lost resources, or heightened recession. Sometimes they mean lost U.S. lives. Rarely do they mean lost Arab lives. While these costs are real, the best grounds on which to oppose the Gulf War is that it is not just.

<LI>It is not anti-interventionist. It is not pro-national sovereignty. It is not pro-international legality. It is not pro-"a new and more peaceful world order."

<LI>This war is to reinforce U.S. control of Arab oil. It is to crush Arab nationalism.

<LI>It is to establish the U.S. as the world's policeman with the bills paid, whether they like it or not, by whoever we pass them on to.

<LI>This war should be opposed because it is wrong. We have no right controlling oil prices. No right administering the future of the Middle East. And no right becoming the world's Hessian state, sacrificing much of the U.S. population to a Third World existence in the process.

<LI>We should oppose this war because we oppose militarism as a solution to international conflict.
</UL>

<P>10. What is the logic of our antiwar activism? Raise the social cost.

<UL>
<LI>Arguments that war is immoral will not deter Bush. Arguments that he isn't seeing the costs will not change his mind.

<LI>Pursuers of war, including Bush, don't care about Iraqi lives, American lives, or anyone's lives. The same holds, by and large, for U.S. media which has yet to discuss the potential loss of Arab lives as a central cost of war.

<LI>Nor do U.S. warmakers care about subtle concerns of culture or history. They care about advancing the geopolitical interests of the U.S. as they are understood by the White House and Wall Street. That's all.

<LI>To get Bush to reverse his war policies requires that the public raise costs that warmakers don't want to pay.

<LI>Warmakers do not want to endure an end to business as usual. They do not want war to cause a new generation to turn to activism. They dread the escalation of dissent from events that oppose war, to actions that oppose militarism, to projects that oppose capitalism.

<LI>These costs curtailed U.S. militarism in Indochina. They can do the same, and more, in the Gulf.

<LI>Raise the social cost.
</UL>

<P>11. What should be the focus of our activism? Peace and justice.

<UL>
<LI>Antiwar activity needs to develop lasting consciousness of the causes and purposes of U.S. war policies including understanding underlying institutions. And it also needs to send a powerful message of dissent.

<LI>Events that focus on ROTC, on campus military centers, such as military bases or the Pentagon, and that demand an end to war are excellent.

<LI>Events that focus on centers of domestic suffering that demand an end to war <I>and</I> and end to militarism <I>and</I> a reallocation of military resources to social ends, are still more powerful.

<LI>Multi-focused events will reveal and enlarge not only antiwar militance, but militance extending to gender, race, and class policies and institutions that war-makers hold even more dear. Multi-issue events send an even more powerful and threatening message than single issue efforts, and can have that much more impact.

<LI>They also have the capacity to build a movement that can last beyond the Gulf crisis to attack the causes as well as the symptoms of oppressive institutions. Build a movement not just for peace, but for peace and justice too.

<LI>Create a multi-issue focus.
</UL>

<P>12. What tactics should we use? Demonstrate, demand, disobey.

<UL>
<LI>A gathering of people at a teach-in to learn about U.S. policies threatens leaders of a country who want people as ignorant as possible. A march with many constituencies threatens the leadership of a country who want people as passive and divided as possible. A march that include civil disobedience and says that some people are willing to break laws and, moreover, next time many more will do so, is still more powerful.

<LI>Create a multi-tactic movement.

<LI>But lasting movements also have to develop a positive component that can become a center of organizing energy and a place for learning and support.

<LI>In addition to teach-ins, marches, rallies, and civil disobedience, we need to create lasting coalitions and institutional centers of Peace and Justice in occupied buildings on campuses or in community centers, and/or churches.

<LI>Such student and community centers could be places for people to do peace work: creating leaflets and banners and writing letters to GIs. They could be places from which people could do systematic coordinated canvassing and provide each other with support and help.

<LI>Further, these campus and community centers could be places where people consider how their universities or communities might become centers of peace and conversion rather than militarism. Create a long-term movement.

<H1>The Gulf Crisis</H1>

<P>Noam Chomsky<BR>

</CENTER>


<H3>Aggression and Response</H3>

<P>Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on August 2, 1990 evoked a strong response from the industrial powers; in fact, two rather different responses. The first was an array of economic sanctions of unprecedented severity. The second was the threat of war. Both responses were initiated at once, even before Iraq's annexation of the invaded country. The first response had broad support. The second is pretty much limited to the U.S. and Britain, apart from the family dictatorships that had been placed in charge of the Gulf oil producing states. As leader of the two-member coalition, the U.S. moved quickly to ensure that sanctions could not be effective and to bar any diplomatic initiative.

<P>Two questions at once arise: What explains the unprecedented actions? What lies behind the tactical division over generally shared objectives?

<P>The second question is rarely raised explicitly, except in the course of complaints about our faint-hearted and money-grubbing allies, who lack the courage, integrity and sturdy national character of the Anglo-American duo. The general question, however, suffers from no shortage of answers, including impressive phrases about the sanctity of international law and the U.N. Charter, and our historic mission to punish anyone who dares to violate these sacred principles by resorting to force. President Bush declared that "America stands where it always has, against aggression, against those who would use force to replace the rule of law." While some questioned his tactical judgment, there was widespread admiration for the President's honorable stand, and his forthright renewal of our traditional dedication to nonviolence, the rule of law, and the duty of protecting the weak and oppressed. Scholarship weighed in, adding historical and cross-cultural depth. A noted Cambridge University Professor of Political Science wrote in the Times Literary Supplement (London) that "Our traditions, fortunately, prove to have at their core universal values, while theirs are sometimes hard to distinguish with the naked eye from rampant (and heavily armed) nihilism. In the Persian Gulf today, President Bush could hardly put it more bluntly...." Others too basked in self-adulation, though it was conceded that we had not always applied our traditional values with complete consistency, failures that we are sure to rectify as soon as we have finished with the business at hand. These past lapses are commonly attributed to our understandable preoccupation with defense against the Russians, now of lesser urgency with the U.S. triumph in the Cold War.

<P>The issue was raised to cosmic significance, with visions of a New World Order of peace and justice that lies before us if only the new Hitler can be stopped before he conquers the world -- after having failed to overcome post-revolutionary Iran with its severely weakened military, even with the support of the U..S., USSR, Europe, and the major Arab states. "We live in one of those rare transforming moments in history," Secretary Baker declared, with the Cold War over and "an era full of promise" just ahead, if we can avoid "the self-defeating path of pretending not to see." Commentators marvelled at the "wondrous sea change" at the United Nations, which is "functioning as it was designed to do...for virtually the first time in its history" and thus offering "a bold pattern of peacekeeping for the post-Cold War world" (New York Times). The standard explanation is that with the U.S. victory in the Cold War, Soviet obstructionism and the "shrill, anti-Western rhetoric" of the Third World no longer render the U.N. ineffective.


<H3>Narrowing the Options</H3>

<P>Professing high principle, Washington moved vigorously to block all diplomatic efforts, restricting its own contacts with Iraq to delivery of an ultimatum demanding immediate and total capitulation to U.S. force -- what George Bush called "going the extra mile to achieve a peaceful solution." Europeans were warned not to deviate from the firm U.S. rejection of any form of diplomacy or any hint of willingness to negotiate. Washington also sternly rejected any "linkage" with regional issues, expressing its moral revulsion at the very thought of rewarding an aggressor by considering problems of armaments, security, and others in a regional context. The effect was to minimize the likelihood that Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait might be arranged without the threat or use of force. It is difficult to imagine that this was not the purpose of the rejection of "linkage," also an unprecedented stand.

<P>These solemn declarations of high principle were generally accepted at face value, leaving unchallenged the pretexts offered for war. Debate was therefore limited to tactical questions of U.S. interest. In this limited frame, the Administration is sure to prevail, and did. The rhetorical stance, in contrast, could not have survived the slightest challenge. The general abdication of critical standards was thus a matter of no small importance -- not for the first time.

<P>Some did express concern, and a degree of wonder, over the inability of backward sectors to perceive our nobility. "Perhaps most troublesome for Bush in his effort to create a `new world order'," one reporter observed plaintively, is the fact that "a surprising number of Europeans believe that the United States is in the gulf not to free Kuwait or punish Saddam Hussein but to bolster its own influence and power." A poll reported in the same paper the same day (Boston Globe, Jan. 13) revealed that a surprising number of Americans share these delusions, believing that control over oil is the "key reason" for the U.S. troop presence (50%), not "liberation of Kuwait from Iraqi occupation" (28%) or "neutralization of Iraq's weapons capabilities (14%). Such confusions are even more rampant in the Third World, apart from the wealthy and privileged elements which, like their counterparts here, have a proper understanding of our innate virtue and benevolence.

<P>Washington's explicit rejection of any form of diplomacy was welcomed as a "sensational offer to negotiate" (in the words of a British loyalist), a forthcoming willingness to "explore any diplomatic avenue," along the "diplomatic track" that had been effectively blocked. There was eloquent rhetoric about Iraqi human rights abuses, and the anguish they caused George Bush, who "keeps copies of Amnesty International's reports on Iraqi torture in his office" (Daniel Yergin) and whose soul had been seared by the experience of fighting to stop Hitler and Tojo, after the cowardly appeasers had let them go too far.

<P>Rejection of diplomacy was explicit from the outset. New York Times chief diplomatic correspondent Thomas Friedman (in effect, the State Department voice at the Times) attributed the Administration's rejection of "a diplomatic track" to its concern that negotiations might "defuse the crisis" at the cost of "a few token gains in Kuwait" for the Iraqi dictator, perhaps "a Kuwaiti island or minor border adjustments" (August 22). Anything short of capitulation to U.S. force is unacceptable, whatever the consequences.

<P>Diplomatic options opened shortly after Saddam Hussein realized the nature of the forces arrayed against him, apparently with some surprise, though we cannot evaluate their prospects because they were barred at once by Washington's rigid rejectionism. On August 12, Iraq proposed a settlement linking its withdrawal from Kuwait to withdrawal from other occupied Arab lands: Syria and Israel from Lebanon, and Israel from the territories it conquered in 1967. Two weeks later, about the time that Friedman warned of the dangers of diplomacy, the Times learned of a considerably more far-reaching offer from Iraq, but chose to suppress it. A similar (or perhaps the same) offer was leaked to the suburban New York journal Newsday, which published it very prominently on August 29, compelling the Times to give it marginal and dismissive notice the next day. The Iraqi offer was delivered to National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft by a former high-ranking U.S. official on August 23. It called for Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait in return for the lifting of sanctions, full Iraqi control of the Rumailah oil field that extends about 2 miles into Kuwaiti territory over a disputed border, and guaranteed Iraqi access to the Gulf, which involves the status of two uninhabited islands that had been assigned by Britain to Kuwait in the imperial settlement, thus leaving Iraq virtually landlocked. Iraq also proposed negotiations on an oil agreement "satisfactory to both nations' national security interest," on "the stability of the gulf," and on plans "to alleviate Iraq's economical and financial problems." There was no mention of U.S. troop withdrawal or other preconditions. An Administration official who specializes in Mideast affairs described the proposal as "serious" and "negotiable."

<P>Like others, this diplomatic opportunity quickly passed. Where noted at all in the media, the offer was dismissed on the grounds that the White House was not interested; surely true, and sufficient for the offer to be written out of history, on the assumption that all must serve the whims of power. Iraqi proposals continued to surface, along with others. As of January 15, the last known example was made public on January 2, when U.S. officials disclosed an Iraqi offer "to withdraw from Kuwait if the United States pledges not to attack as soldiers are pulled out, if foreign troops leave the region, and if there is agreement on the Palestinian problem and on the banning of all weapons of mass destruction in the region" (Knut Royce, Newsday, Jan. 3). Officials described the offer as "interesting" because it dropped any claims to the islands in the Gulf and the Rumailah oil field, and "signals Iraqi interest in a negotiated settlement." A State Department Mideast expert described the proposal as a "serious prenegotiation position." The U.S. "immediately dismissed the proposal," Royce continues. It passed without mention in the Times, and was barely noted elsewhere.

<P>The Times did however report on the same day that Yasser Arafat, after consultations with Saddam Hussein, indicated that neither of them "insisted that the Palestinian problem be solved before Iraqi troops get out of Kuwait." According to Arafat, the report continues, "Mr. Hussein's statement Aug. 12, linking an Iraqi withdrawal to an Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza Strip, was no longer operative as a negotiating demand." All that is necessary is "a strong link to be guaranteed by the five permanent members of the Security Council that we have to solve all the problems in the Gulf, in the Middle East and especially the Palestinian cause."

<P>Two weeks before the deadline for Iraqi withdrawal, then, the possible contours of a diplomatic settlement appeared to be these: Iraq would withdraw completely from Kuwait with a U.S. pledge not to attack withdrawing forces; foreign troops leave the region; the Security Council indicates a serious commitment to settle other major regional problems. Disputed border issues would be left for later consideration. Once again, we cannot evaluate the prospects for settlement along these -- surely reasonable -- lines, because the offers were flatly rejected, and scarcely entered the media or public awareness. The United States and Britain maintained their commitment to force alone.

<P>The strength of that commitment was again exhibited when France made a last-minute effort to avoid war on January 14, proposing that the Security Council call for "a rapid and massive withdrawal" from Kuwait along with a statement that Council members would bring their "active contribution" to a settlement of other problems of the region, "in particular, of the Arab-Israeli conflict and in particular to the Palestinian problem by convening, at an appropriate moment, an international conference" to assure "the security, stability and development of this region of the world." The French proposal was supported by Belgium, a Council member, and Germany, Spain, Italy, Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, and several non-aligned nations. The U.S. and Britain rejected it (along with the Soviet Union, irrelevantly). U.N. Ambassador Thomas Pickering stated that the proposal was unacceptable, because it went beyond previous U.N. resolutions on the Iraqi invasion.

<P>The Ambassador's statement was technically correct. The wording of the proposal is drawn from a different source, namely, a Security Council decision of December 20, adjoined to Resolution 681, which calls on Israel to observe the Geneva Conventions in the occupied territories. In that statement the members of the Security Council called for "an international conference, at an appropriate time, properly structured," to help "achieve a negotiated settlement and lasting peace in the Arab-Israeli conflict." The statement was excluded from the actual Resolution to prevent a U.S. veto. Note that there was no "linkage" to the Iraqi invasion, which was unmentioned.

<P>We do not, again, know whether the French initiative could have succeeded in averting war. The U.S. feared that it might, and therefore blocked it, in accord with its zealous opposition to any form of diplomacy, and, in this case, its equally strong opposition to an international conference that might lead the way towards a political settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict that the U.S. has long opposed. In this rejectionism, George Bush was joined by Saddam Hussein, who gave no public indication of any interest in the French proposal, though doing so might possibly have averted war.

<P>The U.S. at once dispatched a huge expeditionary force to the Gulf (even before the annexation, which was therefore not a factor in this decision). That force was virtually doubled after the November elections. While a deterrent force could be kept in the desert and offshore, hundreds of thousands of troops cannot be maintained in the desert for long, and withdrawal of this military force without victory was ruled out by same lofty rhetorical stance that blocked the diplomatic track. The predictable effect of this decision -- and, presumably, its purpose -- was to undercut the reliance on sanctions, which could only have an impact over an extended period.

<P>We might take a moment to review the standard arguments against sanctions. Advocates of force observed somberly that there is no guarantee that sanctions would work. That is quite true; there is also no guarantee that the sun will rise tomorrow. There is, however, a strong probability that in this case sanctions would have been effective, if only because of their extraordinary severity, and because -- for once -- the usual "sanctions busters" (the U.S., Britain, and their allies) happen to be on board, a simple truth that plainly cannot be expressed.

<P>It was also argued that we cannot delay until sanctions have an effect. Why can't we wait? One reason offered is that the coalition would not hold -- a tacit concession of the lack of support for the U.S. stance. Another is that it would be too costly for us. But the costs of a deterrent force would, in fact, be slight. The main argument is again high moral principle: it offends our sensibilities to stand by while the aggressor remains unpunished. That is not very convincing, to put it mildly. As Edward Herman discussed in the January issue of Z magazine, for two decades South Africa defied the U.N. and the World Court on Namibia, looting and terrorizing the occupied country and using it as a base for its aggression against neighboring states, exacting an awesome toll. In the 1980s, the cost of South African terror just to its neighbors is estimated by the UN Economic Commission on Africa at more than $60 billion and 1.5 million lives. No one proposed bombing South Africa, or withholding food. The U.S. pursued "quiet diplomacy" and "constructive engagement," insisting upon "linkage" to a variety of other issues, with thoughtful consideration of the interests of the occupiers. Exactly the same was true when George Shultz attempted to broker Israel's partial withdrawal from Lebanon, also with ample reward for the aggressor, who had been the beneficiary of U.S. material aid and Security Council vetoes as it battered the defenseless country in the course of completely unprovoked aggression that opened, symbolically, with bombing of civilian targets leaving over 200 killed, including 60 patients in a children's hospital.

<P>Avoidance of "linkage," whatever the merits of this stance, is another diplomatic innovation devised for the present case. Obviously, it reflects no high principle. In fact, no argument whatsoever was presented for this radical departure from normal procedure -- and none was needed, given the reflexive obedience of the educated classes.

<P>From the outset, then, policy was carefully designed to reduce the likely alternatives to two: war, or Iraqi capitulation to a display of armed might. Crucially, the peaceful means prescribed by international law must be barred. On that fundamental principle, the U.S. and Britain have been adamant, standing almost alone.

<P>The moral level of debate was illustrated by the reaction to an influential interview with the commander of the U.S. forces, General Norman Schwartzkopf, featured in a front-page story in the New York Times, which opened as follows:

<P>"The commander of the American forces facing Iraq said today that his troops could obliterate Iraq, but cautioned that total destruction of that country might not be `in the interest of the long-term balance of power in this region'."

<P>The warning was elaborated by others. In a typical example, Times Middle East specialist Judith Miller, under the heading "Political Cost of Victory Questioned," wrote:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
There are few who doubt that if there is a war in the Persian Gulf, the United States and its allies can "turn Baghdad into a parking lot," as an American diplomat in the Middle East recently put it. But many analysts are increasingly concerned about the probable effect of such a victory on longer-term American interests in the region. William Crowe, a former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, warned last week that "many Arabs would deeply resent a campaign that would necessarily kill large numbers of their Muslim brothers...."
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>In short, we could slaughter 17 million people and wipe a country off the face of the earth, but mass extermination might be tactically unwise, harmful to our interests. This wrenching moral issue was thoughtfully discussed in many articles. Those who have expressed concern over the decline of our traditional values may rest assured.


<H3>High Principle</H3>

<P>As noted, the largely uncritical acceptance of Washington's rhetorical stance by articulate opinion was no insignificant matter. Its effect was to undercut reliance on sanctions and to bar exploration of the diplomatic track, on the grounds that "aggressors cannot be rewarded" -- in this unique case. The effect, then, was to leave violence as the only policy option: Iraq might succumb to the threat, or pay the price. Restricting the options to these was no small achievement, given the unprecedented character of the U.S. stance and its narrow base of real support. The rhetorical stance assumed by the White House, and accepted uncritically by its mainstream critics as well for the most part, therefore merits some attention. Not a great deal of attention is required, however, because the rhetorical stance cannot withstand even a moment's scrutiny.

<P>As a matter of logic, principles cannot be selectively upheld. As a matter of fact, the U.S. is one of the major violators of the principles now grandly proclaimed. We conclude at once, without ambiguity or equivocation, that the U.S. does not uphold these principles. We do not admire Saddam Hussein as a man of principle because he condemns Israel's annexation of the Syrian Golan Heights, nor do his laments over human rights abuses in the occupied territories encourage our hopes for a kinder, gentler world. The same reasoning applies when George Bush warns of appeasing aggressors and clutches to his heart the Amnesty International report on Iraqi atrocities (after August 2), but not AI reports on El Salvador, Turkey, Indonesia, the Israeli occupied territories, and a host of others. As for the "wondrous sea change" at the U.N., it has little to do with the end of the Cold War, or the improved behavior of the Russians and Third World degenerates, whose "shrill, anti-Western rhetoric" commonly turns out to be a call for observance of international law, a weak barrier against the depredations of the powerful.

<P>The U.N. was able to respond to Iraq's aggression because -- for once -- the U.S. happened to be opposed to criminal acts, as distinct from its own invasion of Panama in the first post-Cold War act of aggression, the Turkish invasion and virtual annexation of northern Cyprus, Israel's invasion of Lebanon and annexation of the Golan Heights (sanctions vetoed by the U.S.), the Moroccan invasion of the Sahara (justified on grounds that "one Kuwait in the Arab world is enough"; it is unjust for such vast resources to be in the hands of a tiny population); and much else. As for the unprecedented severity of the U.N. sanctions, that was a direct result of intense U.S. pressures, cajolery, and threats, and the considerations of self-interest that motivate other powers, great and small.

<P>Saddam Hussein is a murderous gangster, just as he was before August 2, when he was an amiable friend and favored trading partner. His invasion of Kuwait is another crime, comparable to others, not as terrible as some; for example, the Indonesian invasion and annexation of East Timor, which reached near-genocidal levels thanks to diplomatic and material support from the two righteous avengers of the Gulf. The truth was revealed by U.N. Ambassador Daniel Patrick Moynihan in his memoirs, describing his success in implementing State Department directives to render the U.N. "utterly ineffective in whatever measures it undertook" in response to Indonesia's aggression, because "the United States wished things to turn out as they did, and worked to bring this about." It was stated with equal frankness by Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans, explaining his country's acquiescence in the forcible annexation of East Timor: "The world is a pretty unfair place, littered with examples of acquisition by force...." Saddam Hussein's aggression, in contrast, called forth Australian Prime Minister Hawke's ringing declaration that "big countries cannot invade small neighbors and get away with it." If Libya were to join the Butcher of Baghdad in exploiting Kuwait's oil riches, we would be hearing calls to nuke the bastards. The reaction was slightly different when Australia joined the Butcher of Jakarta a few weeks ago in development of the rich petroleum resources of the Timor sea.

<P>U.N. peacekeeping efforts have regularly been frustrated by the United States. The first post-Cold War U.N. session (1989-90) was typical in this regard. Three Security Council resolutions were vetoed, all by the U.S. Two condemned George Bush's murderous invasion of Panama, the third condemned Israeli human rights abuses; the U.S. vetoed a similar resolution the following May. Britain and France joined the U.S. in blocking one of the resolutions on Panama; the other, condemning U.S. violations of diplomatic rights, was voted 13-1, Britain abstaining. The General Assembly passed two resolutions calling on all states to observe international law. The U.S. voted against both, alone with Israel. The first condemned the continuing U.S. support for the contras, the second, U.S. economic warfare against Nicaragua -- both declared "unlawful" by the World Court, but irrelevantly, by the standards of the U.S. and its allies. A resolution condemning the acquisition of territory by force passed 151-3 (U.S., Israel, Dominica); this was yet another call for a political settlement of the Arab-Israel conflict, which the U.S. has blocked for 20 years.

<P>The U.S. is far in the lead in the past 20 years in Security Council vetoes. Britain is second, France a distant third, and the USSR fourth. The situation is similar in the General Assembly, where the U.S. regularly votes against resolutions on aggression, international law, human rights abuses, disarmament, and other relevant issues, often alone, or with a few client states. That has been the pattern since the U.N. ceased to serve as a virtual instrument of U.S. foreign policy. There is no reason to expect that the Soviet collapse will induce the U.S. and Britain to end their campaign against international law, diplomacy, and collective security -- a campaign that had little to do with the Cold War, as a look at cases shows. The record offers no prospects for a bright new era.

<P>The actual stance of the U.S. was made clear during the debate over its invasion of Panama, when U.N. Ambassador Thomas Pickering lectured the Security Council on the meaning of Article 51 of the Charter, which restricts the use of force to self-defense against armed attack until the Council acts. These words permit the U.S. to use "armed force...to defend our interests," Pickering explained to his backward students. The same Article permits the U.S. to invade Panama to prevent its "territory from being used as a base for smuggling drugs into the United States," the Justice Department added. Washington has even claimed the right of "self-defense against future attack" under Article 51 (justifying the terror bombing of Libya). In brief, like other states, the U.S. will do what it chooses, regarding law and principle as ideological weapons, to be used when serviceable, to be discarded when they are a nuisance. We do no one any favors by suppressing these truisms.

<P>Washington's rejection of "linkage" in this particular case is readily understandable when we dispense with illusion. The U.S. opposes diplomatic resolution of each of the major issues; therefore it opposes linking them. Simple enough.

<P>There are two crucial regional issues, apart from Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait, a fact underscored by the Iraqi proposal released by U.S. officials on January 2. The first is the Arab-Israel conflict, the second, the matter of weapons of mass destruction. On both issues, the U.S. has been consistently opposed to the diplomatic track.

<P>Consider first the Arab-Israel conflict. There has long been a broad international consensus on a political settlement of this conflict. The U.S. and Israel have opposed it, and have been isolated in this rejectionism, as the recent General Assembly vote of 151-3 indicates. The President likes to tell us how James Baker has labored to advance the peace process, but he remains silent about the terms of the famed Baker plan, with its unwavering support for the Israeli government "peace plan." Its basic principles ban an "additional Palestinian state" (Jordan already being one); bar any "change in the status of Judea, Samaria and Gaza other than in accordance with the basic guidelines of the [Israeli] Government," which preclude any meaningful Palestinian self-determination; reject negotiations with the PLO, thus denying Palestinians the right to choose their own political representation; and call for "free elections" under Israeli military rule with much of the Palestinian leadership rotting in prison camps. Unsurprisingly, the official U.S. position is kept carefully under wraps, and diplomacy is not a policy option.

<P>Another of the President's favorite slogans is that "it is the world against Saddam Hussein." It is even more true that it is the world against George Bush and his predecessors, as the recent U.N. vote again illustrates. For this reason, the U.S. has consistently opposed an international conference on the Middle East. The excuse offered now is that we must not reward aggression. But that cannot be the reason. The U.S. is commonly quite happy to reward aggression, and it opposed an international conference long before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, and continued to oppose a call for such a conference even when it was not "linked" to Iraq, as noted above. The real reason is that at an international conference, the U.S. would be isolated. Such a conference could only lead to pressures for a political settlement that the U.S. rejects. Therefore, Washington opposes an international conference. For the same reasons the U.S. has vetoed Security Council resolutions calling for a political settlement and blocked other diplomatic initiatives for the past 20 years.

<P>The same is true with regard to weapons of mass destruction, surely an issue that must be considered on a regional basis, hence with the dread "linkage," as in all similar cases. In April 1990, Saddam Hussein, then still George Bush's friend and ally, offered to destroy his chemical and biological weapons if Israel agreed to destroy its non-conventional weapons -- including its nuclear weapons. The State Department welcomed Hussein's offer to destroy his own arsenal, but rejected the link "to other issues or weapons systems." Note that these remain unspecified. Acknowledgement of the existence of Israeli nuclear weapons would raise the question why all U.S. aid to Israel is not illegal under congressional legislation of the 1970s that bars aid to any country engaged in clandestine nuclear weapons development.

<P>The story continues. In December, speaking at a joint press conference with Secretary of State Baker, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze proposed a nuclear-free zone in the Middle East if Iraq withdraws from Kuwait. Baker gave "qualified support," the press observed, but "carefully avoided using the words `nuclear-free zone' " -- for the reason just noted. A week later, Iraq offered to "scrap chemical and mass destruction weapons if Israel was also prepared to do so," Reuters reported. The offer seems to have passed in silence here. Iraq's more recent call for "the banning of all weapons of mass destruction in the region" as part of a negotiated settlement of its withdrawal from Kuwait has already been mentioned.

<P>We gain further understanding of the high principles inspiring the U.S. and its British partner when we look at the forces assembled, however ambiguously, under their flag. It has been hard to overlook the fact that there is little to distinguish Saddam Hussein from Syria's Hafez el-Assad, apart from current service to U.S. needs; in fact, prior to August 2 their rankings were often reversed within the doctrinal system. An inconvenient Amnesty International release of November 2 reported that Saudi security forces tortured and abused hundreds of Yemeni "guest workers," also expelling 750,000 of them, "for no apparent reason other than their nationality or their suspected opposition to the Saudi Arabian government's position in the gulf crisis." Apparently George Bush, though an avid reader of AI reports (so we are told), somehow missed this one. The press also looked the other way, though in the case of Arab states, there is no shortage of commentators to denounce their evil nature.

<P>It was also necessary to overlook Turkey's abysmal human rights record, not to speak of its conquest and virtual annexation of northern Cyprus, with thousands of casualties and hundreds of thousands of refugees after an orgy of killing, torture, rape and pillage to extirpate the last remnants of Greek culture back to classical antiquity. Nonetheless, few winced when George Bush praised Turkey for serving "as a protector of peace" as it joined those who "stand up for civilized values around the world," opposing Saddam Hussein.

<P>The alliance with Turkey also required some fancy footwork because of the question of the Kurds in northern Iraq. It is difficult not to notice that Iraqi forces facing U.S. troops would be severely weakened if the U.S. were to support a Kurdish rebellion. Washington rejected this option, presumably out of concern that a Kurdish rebellion in Iraq might spread to Eastern Turkey, where the huge Kurdish population (subjected to torture and other severe punishments for the crime of speaking or writing Kurdish or otherwise identifying themselves as Kurds) suffer brutal oppression. In a rare notice of the issue in the press, the Wall Street Journal observed that "the West fears that pressing the `Kurdish question' with Turkey, Syria and Iran...could weaken the anti-Iraq alliance." The report adds that "the U.S. administration pointedly refused to meet with an Iraqi Kurdish leader who visited Washington in August" to ask for support, and that "Kurds say Ankara is using the Gulf crisis and Turkey's resulting popularity in the West as cover for a crackdown" -- while Western commentary now laments Iraq's vicious treatment of the Kurds, whose grim fate has been cynically exploited by the West for many years. Other reports confirm new population transfers in the regions near the Iraqi border, with several hundred villages either partially or totally evacuated, though increased press censorship -- the most severe since 1925, according to an informed Turkish source -- leaves the matter obscure.

<P>The avoidance of this topic is particularly remarkable because of its relevance to the sole issue that is supposed to concern us, in accord with our traditional values: saving American lives. Evidently, this concern was outweighed by the higher priority of protecting Turkey's right to repress its Kurdish population.

<P>Proceeding through the list, the plea that Washington is inspired by any wisp of principle can hardly be sustained. Inquiry will reveal nothing beyond the usual reasons of state.

<P>It is child's play to demonstrate that Saddam Hussein is a major criminal, who would be subjected to the judgment of Nuremberg in a just world. Many others would stand beside him before the bar of justice, among them many of his most passionate accusers, some well within the reach of U.S. law enforcement. The arguments advanced to justify the bombing of Baghdad might be taken seriously if they were put forth by people who had also been calling eloquently for the bombing of Jakarta, Ankara, Tel Aviv, Cape Town, and many other capitals, not excluding Washington.

<P>Returning to the two questions raised at the outset, the answer to the first is straightforward: the response to Saddam Hussein's aggression is unprecedented because he stepped on the wrong toes. The U.S. is upholding no high principle in the Gulf. Nor is any other state.

<P>Let's also be clear about a further point. Since the justifications for war are based on an appeal to principle that is clearly fraudulent, it follows that no reason at all has been given for going to war. None whatsover. Doubtless there are reasons, but not the ones that have been offered, because these plainly cannot be taken seriously.


<H3>The Guardians of the Gulf</H3>

<P>Let us turn now to the second question raised: Why have the U.S. and Britain insisted on the threat or use of force to attain the ends generally shared, instead of sanctions and diplomacy? Why do we find two major First World military forces in the Gulf, the U.S. and Britain, while other powers declined to give more than token support -- even financial? Furthermore, even after extensive U.S. pressures, the Security Council could not be moved beyond an ambiguous resolution authorizing "all necessary means" to secure Iraqi withdrawal: diplomacy, sanctions, or military action by those intent on undertaking it. As noted by David Scheffer, senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, the resolution "neither requests nor commands the use of military force" and "avoids the terminology of war and such explicit terms as `armed force' or `military measures'." When the history of this period emerges, if it ever does, it may well turn out that, in reality, the U.N. record did not deviate much from the standard pattern of attempts at peacekeeping frustrated by U.S. veto; in this case, attempts to pursue the course of sanctions and diplomacy, blocked by U.S. threats and pressures, leading the U.N. in effect to wash its hands of the matter, never pursuing the procedures by which the Security Council may make "plans for the application of armed force," according to the Charter.

<P>At this point, one can only speculate about the reasons for the U.S.-British insistence on force, but there are relevant factors, including the historical background and the nature of the emerging world order.

<P>The U.S. and U.K. largely established the post-war settlement in the region. A principle guiding U.S. policy has been that the incomparable energy resources of the Gulf region, and the enormous profits reaped, must remain under the effective control of the U.S., its corporations, and dependable allies and clients. Britain viewed matters in a similar light. In the early post-war years, there was considerable conflict between the U.S. and Britain over the terms of the imperial settlement, resolved by the 1950s within the global order dominated by the United States.

<P>Iraq challenged Anglo-American privilege in 1958, when a nationalist military coup overthrew a dependent regime. There is, of course, an earlier history, including British terror bombing of civilians and the request of the RAF Middle East command for authorization to use chemical weapons "against recalcitrant Arabs as experiment." The request was granted by the Secretary of State at the War office, who was "strongly in favour" of "using poisoned gas against uncivilised tribes" (Winston Churchill) -- another illustration of the "universal values" that animate our traditions.

<P>In his history of the oil industry, Christopher Rand describes the 1958 coup as "America's biggest setback in the region since the war," "a shocking experience for the United States" that "undoubtedly provok[ed] an agonizing reappraisal of our nation's entire approach to the Persian Gulf." Recently released British and American documents help flesh out earlier surmises.

<P>Kuwait was a particular concern. The "new Hitler" of the day was the secular nationalist Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt, and it was feared that his pan-Arab nationalism might spread to Iraq, Kuwait, and beyond. One reaction to the 1958 coup was a U.S. Marine landing in Lebanon to prop up the regime, and apparent authorization of use of nuclear weapons by President Eisenhower "to prevent any unfriendly forces from moving into Kuwait" (in his words). Britain considered several options for Kuwait, the least harsh being a grant of nominal independence, but with acceptance of "the need, if things go wrong, ruthlessly to intervene, whoever it is has caused the trouble" (Foreign Secretary Selwyn Lloyd). Lloyd stressed "the complete United States solidarity with us over the Gulf," including the need to "take firm action to maintain our position in Kuwait" and the "similar resolution" of the U.S. "in relations to the Aramco oilfields" in Saudi Arabia; the Americans "agree that at all costs these oilfields [in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Qatar] must be kept in Western hands." Six months before the Iraqi coup, Lloyd summarized the major concerns, including free access to Gulf oil production "on favourable terms and for sterling," and "suitable arrangements for the investment of the surplus revenues of Kuwait," a matter of no little significance.

<P>Declassified U.S. documents outline British goals in similar terms: "the U.K. asserts that its financial stability would be seriously threatened if the petroleum from Kuwait and the Persian Gulf area were not available to the U.K. on reasonable terms, if the U.K. were deprived of the large investments made by that area in the U.K. and if sterling were deprived of the support provided by Persian Gulf oil." These British needs, and the fact that "An assured source of oil is essential to the continued economic viability of Western Europe," provide some reason for the U.S. "to support, or if necessary assist, the British in using force to retain control of Kuwait and the Persian Gulf." In November 1958, the National Security Council recommended that the U.S. "Be prepared to use force, but only as a last resort, either alone or in support of the United Kingdom," if these interests are threatened. In January, the National Security Council had advised that Israel might provide a barrier to Arab nationalism, articulating the basis for one element of the system of control over the Middle East developed in the years that followed.

<P>The concern that Gulf oil and riches be available to support the ailing British economy was extended by the early 1970s to the U.S. economy, which was visibly declining relative to Japan and German-led Europe. Furthermore, control over oil serves as a means to influence these rivals/allies, a fact noted in the internal record in the early post-war years. One of the major architects of the New World Order of that day, George Kennan, advised that Japan should be helped to reindustrialize within the U.S.-dominated global framework, but that the U.S. should keep control of its energy system, which would give the U.S. "veto power" if some time in the distant future, Japan might get out of hand. That "veto power" is not as strong today, with the decline of U.S. hegemony; but influence over oil production, prices, and access is still not a negligeable factor in world affairs. And as the U.S. and Britain lose their former economic dominance, privileged access to the rich profits of Gulf oil production is a matter of serious concern.

<P>Capital flow from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the other Gulf principalities to the U.S. and Britain has provided significant support for their economies, corporations, and financial institutions. These are among the reasons why the U.S. and Britain have often not been averse to increases in oil price. The issues are too intricate to explore here, but these factors surely remain operative. It comes as no great surprise that the two states that established the imperial settlement and have been its main beneficiaries and guarantors are now girding for war in the Gulf, while others keep their distance.

<P>Also worth noting is a division in the Arab world. By and large, support for the U.S. military initiative tends to decline as the influence of the public increases. Commentators have occasionally noted that support for the U.S. military initiative was least in the governments that had "nascent democratic movements": Jordan, Algeria, Yemen, and Tunisia (Judith Miller, New York Times). Administration analysts expressed concern that if U.S. troops were kept in place too long, the "Islamic religious periods" (the Hajj and Ramadan) would allow more expression of popular feelings and "could set off protests and perhaps coups" that "could topple western-oriented governments in the region and cut the diplomatic ground out from under US-led troops facing Iraq" (Peter Gosselin, Boston Globe). Similar concerns are regularly voiced about the home front. The standard conclusion is that the U.S. must therefore strike fast. Fear of the public is a normal feature of statecraft, as familiar as it is instructive.


<H3>The New World Order</H3>

<P>Secretary Baker's comments on the new "era full of promise" raise another issue relevant to explanation of the U.S.-U.K. stance. The New World Order that has become a virtual cliche since August is real enough, though the lovely phrases about peace and justice are another matter.

<P>Basic elements of the New World Order were coming into focus 20 years ago, with the emergence of a "tripolar world" as economic power diffused within U.S. domains. The U.S. remains the dominant military power, but its economic superiority, though still manifest, has declined, and may well decline further as the costs of Reagan's party for the rich fall due. The collapse of Soviet tyranny adds several new dimensions. First, new pretexts are needed for Third World intervention, a serious challenge for the educated classes. Second, there are now prospects for the "Latin Americanization" of much of the former Soviet empire, that is, for its reversion to a quasi-colonial status, providing resources, cheap labor, markets, investment opportunities, and other standard Third World amenities. But the U.S. and Britain are not in the lead in this endeavor. A third important consequence is that the U.S is more free than before to use force, the Soviet deterrent having disappeared. That may well increase the temptation for Washington to transfer problems to the arena of forceful confrontation. The United States intends to maintain its near monopoly of force, with no likely contestant for that role. One effect will be exacerbation of domestic economic difficulties; another, a renewed temptation to "go it alone" in relying on the threat of force rather than diplomacy, generally regarded as an annoying encumbrance.

<P>These factors too help to clarify the varied reactions to the Gulf crisis. War is dangerous; defusing the crisis without a demonstration of the efficacy of force is also an unwelcome outcome for Washington. As for the costs, plainly it would be advantageous for them to be shared, but not at the price of sacrificing the role of lone enforcer. These conflicting concerns led to a sharp elite split over the tactical choice between the threat of force and reliance on sanctions, with the Administration holding to the former course.

<P>In the New World Order, the Third World domains must still be controlled, sometimes by force. This task has been the responsibility of the United States, but with its relative economic decline, the burden becomes harder to shoulder. One reaction is that the U.S. must persist in its historic task, while others pay the bills. Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger explained that the emerging New World Order will be based on "a kind of new invention in the practice of diplomacy": others will finance U.S. intervention to keep order. In the London Financial Times, a respected commentator on international economic affairs described the Gulf crisis as a "watershed event in US international relations," which will be seen in history as having "turned the US military into an internationally financed public good." In the 1990s, he continues, "there is no realistic alternative [to] the US military assuming a more explicitly mercenary role than it has played in the past" (David Hale, FT, Nov. 21).

<P>The financial editor of a leading U.S. conservative daily puts the point less delicately: we must exploit our "virtual monopoly in the security market...as a lever to gain funds and economic concessions" from Germany and Japan (William Neikirk, Chicago Tribune, Sept. 9). The U.S. has "cornered the West's security market" and will therefore be "the world's rent-a-cops"; the phrase "rent-a-thug" might be more accurate, if less appealing. Some will call us "Hessians," he continues, but "that's a terribly demeaning phrase for a proud, well-trained, well-financed and well-respected military"; and whatever anyone may say, "we should be able to pound our fists on a few desks" in Japan and Europe, and "extract a fair price for our considerable services," demanding that our rivals "buy our bonds at cheap rates, or keep the dollar propped up, or better yet, pay cash directly into our Treasury." "We could change this role" of enforcer, he concludes, "but with it would go much of our control over the world economic system."

<P>The British right has added its special touch as well. The editor of the London Sunday Telegraph writes that the "new job" for "the post-Cold War world" is "to help build and sustain a world order stable enough to allow the advanced economies of the world to function without constant interruption and threat from the Third World," a task that will require "instant intervention from the advanced nations" and perhaps even "pre-emptive action." Britain is "no match for Germany and Japan when it comes to wealth creation; or even for France and Italy. But when it comes to shouldering world responsibilities we are more than a match." England will thus join the U.S., with its similar configuration of strengths and weaknesses, in "rising to this challenge." The offer is welcomed by American neoconservatives, happy to have support in the mercenary role.

<P>That role is also welcomed by the local administrators of Gulf riches. A high Gulf official quoted in the Wall Street Journal sees no reason for his son to "die for Kuwait." "We have our white slaves from America to do that," he explains with a "chuckle" -- not having looked too closely at the skin color of his mercenaries, and forgetting momentarily that those who have the guns will call the shots, if he forgets his responsibilities.

<P>The "new job" to which the editor of the Sunday Telegraph refers is actually a very old one, though it needs a new guise. George Bush has been much criticized for his failures as a "communicator," unable to articulate the reasons (necessarily noble) for the attack on Panama and the insistence on force in the Gulf. But the criticism is unfair. The reflex appeal to "defense against the Russians" had lost its last shreds of plausibility, and new constructions are not so simple to devise.

<P>This vision of the future helps illuminate Washington's reaction to the Gulf crisis. It implies that the U.S. must continue to enforce obedience (called "order" or "stability" in the doctrinal system), with the support of other industrial powers. Riches funnelled by the oil-producing monarchies will help prop up the troubled economies of the guardians of order. To be sure, force is only a last resort. It is more cost-effective to use the IMF than the Marines or the CIA if possible; but it is not always possible.

<P>Parallel domestic developments add another dimension to the picture. Studies by the U.S. Labor Department and others predict serious shortages of skilled labor (everything from scientists and managers to technicians and typists) as the educational system deteriorates, part of the collapse of infrastructure accelerated by Reaganite social and economic policies. The tendency may be mitigated by modification of immigration laws to encourage a brain drain, but that is not likely to prove adequate. The predicted result is that the cost of skilled labor will rise and transnational corporations will transfer research, product development and design, marketing, and other such operations elsewhere. For the growing underclass, opportunities will still be available as Hessians. It takes little imagination to picture the consequences if such expectations -- not inevitable, but also not unrealistic -- are indeed realized.

<P>For the traditional victims, the New World Order is not likely to be an improvement on the old, and the prospects for citizens of the mercenary states are also less than attractive, if they permit this scenario to unfold.

<P>Let's return finally to the initial questions raised. Choice of policy is determined by the goals that are sought. If the goal had been to secure Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait, settle regional issues, and move towards a more decent world, then Washington would have followed the peaceful means prescribed by international law: sanctions and diplomacy. If the goal is to firm up the mercenary-enforcer role and establish the rule of force, then the Administration policy of narrowing the options to capitulation or war has a certain chilling logic.

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Note: <A HREF="../dd/dd-c07-s01.html">Chapter 7</A> of <CITE><A HREF="../dd/dd.html">Deterring Democracy</A></CITE> is based in part on this essay.</FONT>
</CENTER>


<P>At any historical moment, we are likely to find a conventional interpretation of the state of the world and our role within it, often gaining the force of unchallenged doctrine. Another near truism is that reality tends to depart from established Truth. The present period is no exception.

<P>That significant, even momentous, changes are underway in the world is clear enough, and has been so for many years. The conventional interpretation need not be elaborated at length; open an arbitrary journal, and it is laid out before you. The U.S. has won the Cold War. Righteousness has triumphed over evil with the victory of democracy, free market capitalism, justice and human rights. As standard bearer of the cause, the United States now leads the way to a New World Order of peace, economic development, and cooperation among those who have seen the light, virtually everyone except for some holdouts like Cuba which still complains irrationally that the Third World isn't getting its due -- or Saddam Hussein, despite our dedicated efforts to improve his behavior by the carrot rather than the stick, an error of judgment soon to be rectified by the sword of the righteous avenger.

<P>There are various ways to assess the validity of this inspiring picture. One is to have a look at the traditional domains of the U.S. (and the West generally), and ask how their people fare at this historic moment, as they celebrate the victory of their side, a triumph of liberal capitalism and democracy so final and conclusive, some feel, that we have reached "the end of history," after which we sink into a sad state of boredom, relieved only by the occasional technical manipulations needed to deal with questions at the margin.

<P>The concern that the fun might be over is not quite as novel as Francis Fukuyama and other devotees of the Hegelian Spirit suggest. At his first meeting with John F. Kennedy in 1958, Walt Rostow, later to become a top adviser of the Kennedy administration, warned -- perhaps a shade prematurely -- that after the astonishing domestic successes achieved by "the nation's creativeness and idealism over the past ninety years, ...we run the danger of becoming a bore to ourselves and the world." In Rostow's picture of the world (shared with Kennedy, according to his account), the basic problems of American society were then approaching full resolution. No real barriers stood in the way of economic progress without serious cyclic disorders, "social equity" for minorities, "the provision of equal educational opportunity," and "the equitable distribution of income." We knew what was needed, and agreed that it should be done. The consensus was so broad and the conclusions so well-founded as to signal "the end of ideology," it was widely held. Like Kennedy, Rostow felt that with the problems of domestic society largely behind us, "the great revolutionary transformations going forward in the underdeveloped world" should now absorb our energies and revitalize "those basic spiritual qualities which have been historically linked to the nation's sense of world mission."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.1" HREF="#FN1.1">1</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The Third World was soon to experience, once again, these "basic spiritual qualities," now with the special cast given them by the knights-errant of Camelot.

<P>Not everyone feels confident that the nature and proper goals of human society are fully understood, and the problems at home so close to resolution that only some minor tinkering remains, just as not all share Tom Wolfe's appreciation of the past decade as "one of the great golden moments that humanity has ever experienced." One need hardly go as far as a Black teenager in Harlem to find a slightly different sense of current realities. And even the most cursory look beyond the borders will locate voices that are not raised in joy and acclaim for the triumph of their champions -- Central American human rights workers and priests, for example -- and do not join the meaningless game of comparing Eastern and Western Europe, or the USSR and the United States, but rather choose, more realistically and more honestly, to compare the current state of regions that were at similar levels of economic and sociopolitical development, with similar endowments and prospects, not many years ago. And despite much curious rhetoric in media and other circles, some perceive that the past years hardly illustrate the thesis that democracy and the free market are the decisive conditions for economic success -- in Japan and the Four Tigers in its periphery, to take the obvious (but not only) example.

<P>Let us survey -- all too briefly -- some of the daily experience of those who should be savoring the fruits of victory. The reasonable course is to begin the inquiry close to home, in the domains where U.S. influence has been so overwhelming that the contours of the triumph must be shatteringly clear. In this first section, I will keep to that, turning in subsequent articles to a broader view, and to some comments on meaningful comparisons that would be made, and studies that would be pursued, if human concerns animated the odes to our virtue that accompany the triumph. I would also like to consider the shape of the New World Order and the U.S. role within it as seen from a perspective that departs from reigning conventions, attending to features of the contemporary world that suggest a rather different conception of where we are and where we are heading.


<H3>The Fruits of Victory</H3>

<P>Few regions of the world have been so dominated by a great power as Central America, which emerged from its usual oblivion in the 1980s, moving to center stage as the traditional order faced an unexpected challenge with the growth of popular movements, inspired in part by the new orientation of the Church toward "a preferential option for the poor" (Puebla Conference of Bishops, 1979). After decades of brutal repression and the destructive impact of the U.S. aid programs of the 1960s -- an "economic miracle" by statistical measures, a disaster for most of the population -- the ground was prepared for meaningful democracy and social change. The mood in Washington darkened further with the overthrow of the Somoza dictatorship and the defeat of his murderous National Guard despite the best efforts of the Carter administration, until the end, to ensure that it would retain effective power.

<P>The reaction was vigorous and swift: violent repression, which decimated popular organizations. The ranks of the small guerrilla organizations swelled as state terror mounted. "The guerrilla groups, the revolutionary groups, almost without exception began as associations of teachers, associations of labor unions, campesino unions, or parish organizations...." with practical and reformist goals, ex-Ambassador Robert White testified before Congress in 1982. The same point has been made by the assassinated Salvadoran Jesuit intellectual Father Ignacio Martin-Baro, among many others.

<P>A decade later, the United States and its local allies could claim substantial success. The challenge to the traditional order was effectively contained. The misery of the vast majority had deepened while the power of the military and the privileged sectors was enhanced behind a facade of democratic forms. Some 200,000 people had been killed, most of them slaughtered outright in a paroxysm of sadistic terror conducted by the forces armed, trained, and advised by the United States. Countless others were maimed, tortured, "disappeared," driven from their homes. The people, the communities, the environment were devastated, possibly beyond repair. It is truly a grand victory.

<P>Elite reaction in the United States is one of gratification and relief. "For the first time, all five of the countries are led by presidents who were elected in contests widely considered free and fair," <CITE>Washington Post</CITE> Central America correspondent Lee Hockstader reports from Guatemala City, expressing the general satisfaction over the victory of "conservative politicians" in elections which, we are to understand, took place on a level playing field with no use of force and no foreign influence. It is true, he continues, that "conservative politicians in Central America traditionally represented the established order," defending the wealthy "despite their countries' grossly distorted income patterns." "But the wave of democracy that has swept the region in recent years appears to be shifting politicians' priorities," so the bad old days are gone forever.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.2" HREF="#FN1.2">2</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The student of American history and culture will recognize the familiar moves. Once again, we witness the miraculous change of course that occurs whenever some particularly brutal excesses of the state have been exposed. Hence all of history, and the reasons for its persistent character, may be dismissed as irrelevant, while we march forward, leading our flock to a new and better world.

<P>The <CITE>Post</CITE> news report does not merely assert that the new conservatives are dedicated populists, unlike those whom the U.S. used to support in the days of its naivete and inadvertent error, now thankfully behind us. Serious journalistic standards require evidence for this central claim, and it is indeed provided. The shift of priorities to a welcome populism is demonstrated by the outcome of the conference of the five presidents in Antigua, Guatemala, just completed. The presidents, all "committed to free-market economics," have abandoned worthless goals of social reform, Hockstader explains. "Neither in the plan nor in the Declaration of Antigua' was there any mention of land reform or suggestion of new government social welfare programs to help the poor." Rather, they are adopting "a trickle-down approach to aid the poor." "The idea is to help the poor without threatening the basic power structure," a regional economist observes, contemplating these imaginative new ideas on how to pursue our vocation of serving the suffering masses.

<P>The headline reads "Central Americans to use Trickle-down Strategy in War on Poverty." Quite properly, the headline captures the basic thrust of the news story and the assumption that frames it: aiding the poor is the highest priority of this new breed of populist conservatives, as it always has been for Washington and the political culture generally. The only question is how to achieve this noble aim. That this has always been our fervent commitment is a doctrine so obviously valid that it need not be supported with any evidence or argument, or even formulated explicitly. It is merely presupposed, and we go on from there. What is newsworthy, and so promising, is the populism of the conservatives we support, and their ingenious and startlingly innovative approach to our traditional commitment to help the poor and suffering: a trickle-down strategy of enriching the wealthy -- a "preferential option for the rich," overcoming the errors of the Puebla Conference of Bishops.

<P>One participant in the meeting is quoted as saying that "These past 10 years have been gruesome for poor people, they've taken a beating." Putting aside the conventions, one might observe that the political outcomes hailed as a triumph of democracy are in no small measure a tribute to the efficacy of U.S. terror, and that the presidents who hold formal power, and their sponsors, might have had something other than a war on poverty in mind. There is also a history of trickle-down approaches to relieving poverty that might be explored. Such an inquiry might lead us to expect that the next 10 years will be no less gruesome for the poor. But that path is not pursued, here or elsewhere in the mainstream.

<P>The <CITE>Post</CITE> story captures well the character and dimensions of the U.S. victory. The satisfaction among the important people is readily understandable.

<P>While the three-day conference of populist conservatives was taking place in Antigua, 33 tortured, bullet-riddled bodies were discovered in Guatemala. They did not disturb the celebration over the triumph of freedom and democracy, or even make the news.

<P>Nor did the rest of the 125 bodies, half with signs of torture, found throughout the country that month, according to the Guatemalan Human Rights Commission. The Commission identified 79 as victims of "extrajudicial execution" by the security forces. Another 29 were kidnapped and 49 injured in kidnap attempts. The report comes to us from Mexico, where the Commission is based so that human rights workers can survive now that the U.S. has succeeded in establishing democracy in Guatemala.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.3" HREF="#FN1.3">3</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>In the Costa Rican journal <CITE>Mesoamerica,</CITE> a report on the Antigua meeting observes that "Now that the Sandinistas have been successfully booted out of office, the pervading attitude among regional and U.S. leaders with respect to the Esquipulas peace mission accomplished'." The core sections of the Central America accords that call for social justice and respect for human rights had been long been consigned to the ashcan, as intended by Oscar Arias and his U.S. sponsors in high places, who, along with the elite political culture generally, revealed by their actions their actual attitudes towards the savage atrocities conducted under the aegis of those with the right priorities.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.4" HREF="#FN1.4">4</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The U.N. Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (CEPAL) reports that the percentage of the Guatemalan population living in extreme poverty increased rapidly after the establishment of democracy in 1985, from 45% in that year to 76% in 1988. A study by the Nutritional Institute of Central America and Panama (INCAP) estimates that half the population live under conditions of extreme poverty, and that in rural areas, where the situation is worse, 13 out of every 100 children under five die of illnesses related to malnutrition. Other studies estimate that 20,000 Guatemalans die of hunger every year, that more than 1000 children died of measles alone in the first four months of 1990, and that "the majority of Guatemala's four million children receive no protection at all, not even for the most elemental rights." The Communique of the January 1990 Conference of Guatemalan Bishops reviews the steady deterioration of the critical situation of the mass of the population as "the economic crisis has degenerated into a social crisis" and human rights, even "the right to dignity," "do not exist."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.5" HREF="#FN1.5">5</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Throughout the region, the desperate situation of the poor majority has become still more grave with the progress of democracy, American-style. Three weeks before the Antigua conference, in his homily marking the completion of President Alfredo Cristiani's first year in office, Archbishop Rivera y Damas of San Salvador deplored the policies of his administration, which have worsened the already desperate plight of the poor; the conservative populist so admired in Washington and New York "is working to maintain the system," the Archbishop said, "favoring a market economy which is making the poor yet poorer."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.6" HREF="#FN1.6">6</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>In the neighboring countries, the situation is much the same. A few days after the encouraging <CITE>Washington Post</CITE> report on the Antigua meeting, an editorial in a leading Honduran journal appeared under the headline "Misery is increasing in Honduras because of the economic adjustment," referring to the new trickle-down strategy that the <CITE>Post</CITE> found so promising --  actually the traditional strategy, its lethal features now more firmly entrenched. The main victims are "the usual neglected groups: children, women, and the aged," according to the conclusions of an academic seminar on "Social Policy in the Context of Crisis," confirmed by "the Catholic Church, the unions, several political parties, and noted economists and statisticians of the country." Two-thirds of the population live below the poverty line, over half of these below the level of "dire need." Unemployment, undernourishment, and severe malnutrition are increasing.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.7" HREF="#FN1.7">7</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The Pan American Health Organization estimates that of 850,000 children born every year in Central America, 100,000 will die before the age of five and two-thirds of those who survive will suffer from malnutrition, with attendant physical or mental development problems. The Inter-American Development Bank reports that per capita income has fallen to the level of 1971 in Guatemala, 1961 in El Salvador, 1973 in Honduras, 1960 in Nicaragua, 1974 in Costa Rica, and 1982 in Panama.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.8" HREF="#FN1.8">8</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Nicaragua was an exception to this trend of increasing misery, but the U.S. terrorist attack and economic warfare succeeded in reversing earlier gains. Nevertheless, infant mortality halved over the decade, from 128 to 62 deaths per thousand births; "Such a reduction is exceptional on the international level," a UNICEF official said in 1989, "especially when the country's war-ravaged economy is taken into account."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.9" HREF="#FN1.9">9</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Studies by CEPAL, the World Health Organization, and others "cast dramatic light on the situation," Mexico's leading daily reports.

<P>They reveal that 15 million Central Americans, almost 60% of the population, live in poverty, of whom 9.7 million live in "extreme poverty." Severe malnutrition is rampant among children. 75% of the peasants in Guatemala, 60% in El Salvador, 40% in Nicaragua, and 35% in Honduras lack health care. To make matters worse, Washington has applied "stunning quotas on sugar, beef, cocoa, cheese, textiles, and limestone, as well as compensation laws and antidumping' policies in cement, flowers, and operations of cellulose and glass." The EEC and Japan have followed suit, also imposing harmful protectionist measures.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.10" HREF="#FN1.10">10</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The environment has shared the fate of those who people it. Deforestation, soil erosion, pesticide poisoning, and other forms of environmental destruction, increasing through the 1980s, are traceable in large measure to the development model imposed upon the region and U.S. militarization of it in recent years. Intense exploitation of resources by agribusiness and export-oriented production have enriched wealthy sectors and their foreign sponsors, and led to statistical growth, with a devastating impact on the land and the people. In El Salvador, large areas have become virtual wastelands as the military has sought to undermine the peasant base of the guerrillas by extensive bombardment, and by forest and crop destruction. There have been occasional efforts to stem the ongoing catastrophe. Like the Arbenz government overthrown in the CIA-run coup that restored the military regime in Guatemala, the Sandinistas initiated a series of environmental reforms and protections. These were desperately needed, both in the countryside and near Managua, where industrial plants had been permitted to dump waste freely. The most notorious case was the U.S. Penwalt corporation, which poured mercury into Lake Managua until 1981.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.11" HREF="#FN1.11">11</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>As in Guatemala 30 years before, these efforts to depart from what the <CITE>Washington Post</CITE> approvingly calls "the Central American mode" were satisfactorily overcome by U.S. terror and economic warfare.

<P>The foreign-imposed development model has emphasized "nontraditional exports" in recent years. Under the free market conditions approved for defenseless Third World countries, the search for survival and gain will naturally lead to products that maximize profit, whatever the consequences. Coca production has soared in the Andes and elsewhere for this reason, but there are other examples as well. After the discovery of clandestine "human farms" and "fattening houses" for children in Honduras and Guatemala, Dr. Luis Genaro Morales, president of the Guatemalan Pediatric Association, said that child trafficking "is becoming one of the principal nontraditional export products," generating $20 million of business a year. The International Human Rights Federation (IHRF), after an inquiry in Guatemala, gave a more conservative estimate, reporting that about 300 children are kidnapped every year, taken to secret nurseries, then sold for adoption at about $10,000 per child.

<P>The IHRF investigators could not confirm reports that organs of babies were being sold to foreign buyers. This macabre belief is widely held in the region, however. A few weeks earlier, the Honduran journal <CITE>Tiempo</CITE> reported that the Paraguayan police rescued 7 Brazilian babies from a gang that "intended to sacrifice them to organ banks in the United States, according to a charge in the courts." The same journal reported shortly after that an Appeals Judge in Honduras ordered "a meticulous investigation into the sale of Honduran children for the purpose of using their organs for transplant operations." A year earlier, the Secretary General of the National Council of Social Services, which is in charge of adoptions, had reported that Honduran children "were being sold to the body traffic industry" for organ transplant. "Fattening houses" for children had been found in San Pedro Sula and elsewhere.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.12" HREF="#FN1.12">12</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>A Resolution on the Trafficking of Central American Children, approved by the European Parliament two months later (November 1988), alleged that near a "human farm" in San Pedro Sula, infant corpses were found that "had been stripped of one or a number of organs." At another "human farm" in Guatemala, babies ranging from 11 days old to four months old had been found. The director of the farm, at the time of his arrest, declared that the children "were sold to American or Israeli families whose children needed organ transplants at the cost of $75,000 per child," the Resolution continues, expressing "its horror in the light of the facts" and calling for investigation and preventive measures.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.13" HREF="#FN1.13">13</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>As the region sinks into further misery, these reports continue to appear. In July 1990, a right-wing Honduran daily, under the headline "Loathsome Sale of Human Flesh," reported that police in El Salvador had discovered a group, headed by a lawyer, that was buying children to resell in the United States. An estimated 20,000 children disappear every year in Mexico, the report continues, destined for this end or for use in criminal activities such as transport of drugs "inside their bodies." "The most gory fact, however, is that many little ones are used for transplant [of organs] to children in the U.S.," which may account for the fact that the highest rate of kidnapping of children from infants to 18-year-olds is in the Mexican regions bordering on the United States.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.14" HREF="#FN1.14">14</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The one exception to the Central America horror story has been Costa Rica, set firmly on a course of state-guided development by the Jose Figueres coup of 1948, with welfare measures combined with harsh repression of labor, and virtual elimination of the armed forces. The U.S. has always kept a wary eye on this deviation from the regional standards, despite the welcome suppression of labor and the favorable conditions for foreign investors. In the 1980s, U.S. pressures to dismantle the social democratic features and restore the army elicited bitter complaints from Figueres and others who shared his commitments. While Costa Rica continues to stand apart from the region in political and economic development, the signs of what the Central Americanization' of Costa Rica" are unmistakeable.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.15" HREF="#FN1.15">15</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Under the pressure of a huge debt, Costa Rica has been compelled to follow "the preferential option for the rich": the IMF model of free market capitalism designed for the Third World, with austerity for the poor, cutback in social programs, and benefits for domestic and foreign investors. The results are coming in. By statistical measures, the economy is relatively strong. But more than 25% of the population -- 715,000 people -- live in poverty, 100,000 in extreme poverty, according to a study published by the ultra-right journal <CITE>La Nacion</CITE> (one feature of Costa Rican democracy being a monopoly of the Spanish language media by the extreme right sectors of the business community). A study by the Gallup office in Costa Rica published in <CITE>Prensa Libre</CITE> gives even higher figures, concluding that "approximately one million people cannot afford a minimum diet, nor pay for clothing, education or health care."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.16" HREF="#FN1.16">16</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The neoliberal economic policies of the 1980s increased social discontent and labor tensions, <CITE>Excelsior</CITE> reports, evoking an "intense attack by unionists, popular organizations," and others against the Arias administration, which has implemented these measures in conformity with U.S. demands and the priorities of privileged sectors. Church sources report that "the belt-tightening measures of the 1980s, which included the elimination of subsidies, low interest credit, price supports and government assistance programs, have driven many campesinos and small farmers off their land," leading to many protests. The Bishop of Limon issued a pastoral letter deploring the social deterioration and "worsening of the problems" to which "banana workers, in great majority immigrants from rural settings where they were property owners, have been subject." He also deplored the harsh labor code and government policies that enabled the growers to purge union leaders and otherwise undermine workers' rights, and the deforestation and pollution the companies have caused, with government support.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.17" HREF="#FN1.17">17</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Environmental degradation is serious here as well, including rapid deforestation and sedimentation that has severely effected virtually every major hydroelectric project. Environmental studies reveal that 42% of Costa Rica's soil shows signs of severe erosion. "Top soil is Costa Rica's largest export," the Vice-Minister of Natural Resources commented. Expanding production for export and logging have destroyed forests, particularly the cattle boom of the 1960s and 1970s promoted by the government, international banks and corporations, and the U.S. aid program, which also undermined food production for domestic needs, as elsewhere in Central America. Environmentalists blame government and business for "ecological illiteracy" -- more accurately, pursuit of profit without regard for externalities, as prescribed in the capitalist model.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.18" HREF="#FN1.18">18</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Submissiveness to these demands has yet to meet the exacting standards of the international guardians of business rights. The IMF suspended assistance to Costa Rica in February 1990, cancelling credits. U.S. aid is also falling, now that there is no longer any need to buy Costa Rica's cooperation in the anti-Sandinista jihad.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.19" HREF="#FN1.19">19</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Economic constraints and foreign pressures have narrowed the political system in the approved manner. In the 1990 elections, the two candidates had virtually identical (pro-business) programs, in accord with "Central American mode" approved by U.S.  liberal doctrine, and were highly supportive of U.S. policies in the region ("right on the mark," the eventual victor, Rafael Angel Calderon, declared in a debate sponsored by the business federation). The Central Americanization of Costa Rica is also revealed by the increasing repression through the 1980s. From 1985, the Costa Rican Human Rights Commission (CODEHU) reported torture, arbitrary arrest, harassment of campesinos and workers, and other abuses by the security forces, including a dramatic rise in illegal detentions and arrests. It links the growing wave of abuses to the increasing militarization of the police and security forces, some of whom have been trained in U.S. and Taiwanese military schools. These charges were supported further when an underground torture chamber was found in the building of the Costa Rican Special Police (OIJ), where prisoners were beaten and subjected to electric shock treatment, including torture of a pregnant woman who aborted and electric shock administered to a 13-year-old child to elicit a false confession. CODEHU alleges that 13 people have died in similar incidents since 1988.  "Battered by charges of corruption and drug trafficking, the Arias administration receives another blow to its diminishing reputation as a bulwark of democracy" from these revelations, the <CITE>Central America Report</CITE> observed.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.20" HREF="#FN1.20">20</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Arias's image "is about to be tarnished" further, according to reports from San Jose that investigators of the Legislative Drug Commission discovered that he had received a check for $50,000 for his campaign fund from Ocean Hunter Seafood, but had put it in his personal bank account. This Miami-based company and its Costa Rican affiliate, Frigarificos de Puntarenas, were identified by U.S. Congressional investigators as a drug trafficking operation.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.21" HREF="#FN1.21">21</A></FONT></SUP> I leave it to the reader to imagine Mark Uhlig's sardonic story in the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> if something similar were hinted about a minor Sandinista official, however flimsy the evidence.

<P>According to official government figures, the security budget increased 15% in 1988 and 13% in 1989 (spending on education rose less than half that much). The press has reported training of security officers in Fort Benning, Georgia, and U.S. bases in Panama, and a Taiwanese military academy, as well as by Israeli secret police, the army of El Salvador, the Guatemalan army special forces, and others. Fifteen private paramilitary, vigilante, and security organizations have been identified, with extreme nationalist and right-wing agendas. A member of the special commission of the legislature set up to investigate these matters described the police as an "army in disguise...out of control." The executive secretary of Costa Rica's Human Rights Commission, Sylvia Porras, noted that "the psychological profile of the police has changed as a result of military training," adding that "we cannot talk any longer of a civilian police force. What we have now is a hidden army."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.22" HREF="#FN1.22">22</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Annual U.S. military aid in the 1980s shot up to about 18 times what it had been from 1946 through 1979. U.S. pressures to rebuild the security forces, reversing the Figueres reforms, have been widely regarded as a factor in the drift towards the Central American mode. The role of Oscar Arias has evoked particular ridicule South of the border. After an Arias article in the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> piously calling on Panama to follow the Costa Rican model and abolish the army, the well-known Mexican writer Gregorio Selser published a review of some Costa Rican realities, beginning with the violent repression of a peaceful demonstration of landless campesinos in September 1986 by Arias's Civil Guard, with many serious injuries. The absence of an army in Costa Rica, he alleges, has become largely a matter of semantics; different words for the same things. He cites an Arias decree of August 5, 1987 -- just at the moment of the signing of the Esquipulas accords that brought him a Nobel Peace prize -- establishing a professional army in all but name, with the full array of ranks and structure; and a 1989 CODEHU report on the training of hundreds of men in military academies of the U.S., Taiwan, Honduras, Guatemala and Panama.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.23" HREF="#FN1.23">23</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Little of this has ever reached the United States, except far from the mainstream. In the context of the Drug War, however, some notice has been taken. An editorial in the <CITE>Miami Herald</CITE> on "Costa Rica's anguish" cites the comments by Sylvia Porras quoted above on the effects of U.S. military training, which has changed the "psychological profile" of the civilian police, turning them to "a camouflaged army." The judgment is not "hyperbole," the editorial concludes, attributing the rapid growth of the army and the recent killing of civilians by the security forces to the Nicaraguan conflict and the drug war -- but with no mention of U.S. pressures, following the norms of the Free Press.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.24" HREF="#FN1.24">24</A></FONT></SUP>


<H3>Good Intentions Gone Awry</H3>

<P>We may conclude this survey of the triumph of free market capitalism in Central America with a look at Panama, recently liberated by Operation Just Cause.

<P>In the months following the liberation, the successful affair largely disappeared from view,<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.25" HREF="#FN1.25">25</A></FONT></SUP> the normal pattern. U.S. goals had been achieved, the triumph had been properly celebrated, and there was little more to say except to record subsequent progress towards freedom, democracy, and good fortune -- or, if that strains credulity, to produce occasional musings on how the best of intentions go awry when we have such poor human material to work with.

<P>Central American sources continued to give considerable attention to the impact of the invasion on civilians, but they were ignored in the occasional reviews of the matter here. <CITE>New York Times</CITE> correspondent Larry Rohter devoted a column to casualty estimates on April 1, citing figures as high as 673 killed, and adding that higher figures, which he attributes only to Ramsey Clark, are "widely rejected" in Panama. He found Panamanian witnesses who described U.S. military actions as restrained, but none with less happy tales.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.26" HREF="#FN1.26">26</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Among the many readily accessible sources deemed unworthy of mention in the <CITE>Times</CITE> (and the media generally), we find such examples as the following.

<P>The Mexican press reported that two Catholic Bishops estimated deaths at perhaps 3000. Hospitals and nongovernmental human rights groups estimated deaths at over 2000.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.27" HREF="#FN1.27">27</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>A joint delegation of the Costa Rica-based Central American Human Rights Commission (CODEHUCA) and the Panamanian Human Rights Commission (CONADEHUPA) published the report of its January 20-30 inquiry, based on numerous interviews. It concluded that "the human costs of the invasion are substantially higher than the official U.S. figures" of 202 civilians killed, reaching 2-3000 according to "conservative estimates." Eyewitnesses interviewed in the urban slums report that U.S. helicopters aimed their fire at buildings with only civilian occupants, that a U.S. tank destroyed a public bus killing 26 passengers, that civilian residences were burned to the ground with many apartments destroyed and many killed, that U.S. troops shot at ambulances and killed wounded, some with bayonets, and denied access to the Red Cross. The Catholic and Episcopal Churches gave estimates of 3000 dead as "conservative." Civilians were illegally detained, particularly union leaders and those considered "in opposition to the invasion or nationalistic." "All the residences and offices of the political sectors that oppose the invasion have been searched and much of them have been destroyed and their valuables stolen." The U.S. imposed severe censorship. Human rights violations under Noriega had been "unacceptably high," the report continues, though of course "mild compared with the record of U.S.-supported regimes in Guatemala and El Salvador." But the U.S invasion "caused an unprecedented level of deaths, suffering, and human rights abuses in Panama." The title of the report is: "Panama: More than an invasion, ...a massacre."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.28" HREF="#FN1.28">28</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Since its topic is not Kuwait, the report passed without notice here.

<P>Sources at the University of Panama estimated at least 5000 dead; the head of the School of Public Administration at the University condemned the U.S. army's "iron control [which] will not allow access to any Panamian institution to find out the correct number of casualties."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.29" HREF="#FN1.29">29</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Physicians for Human Rights, with the concurrence of Americas Watch, reached tentative casualty figures higher than those given by the Pentagon but well below those of COHUDECA-CONADEHUPA and others in Panama. Their estimate is about 300 civilians killed. Americas Watch also gives a "conservative estimate" of at least 3000 wounded, concluding further that civilian deaths were four times as great as military deaths in Panama, and over ten times as high as U.S. casualties (officially given as 23; the U.S. military estimated civilian deaths at 202). They ask: "How does `surgical operation' result in almost ten civilians killed (by official U.S. count) for every American military casualty?" By September, the count of bodies exhumed from several of the mass graves had passed 600.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.30" HREF="#FN1.30">30</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Excavation of mass graves meanwhile continues. By September, the count of bodies found in these graves alone had reached well over 600.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.31" HREF="#FN1.31">31</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The COHUDECA-CONADEHUPA report emphasizes that a great deal is uncertain, because of the violent circumstances, the incineration of bodies, and the lack of records for persons buried in common graves without having reached morgues or hospitals, according to eyewitnesses. note: See CODEHUCA letter to Americas Watch, June 5, 1990, commenting on the Americas Watch report.} Its reports, and the many others of which a few have been cited here, may or may not be accurate. A media decision to ignore them, however, reflects not professional standards but a commitment to power.

<P>On September 30, some of this information finally broke into the mainstream media in a television report by CBS news ("60 minutes").<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.32" HREF="#FN1.32">32</A></FONT></SUP> Pictures of mass graves were shown, and a Panamanian woman who had worked for months to have a few of them opened and the remains identified, exhausting her own resources in the process, estimated civilian deaths at perhaps 4000. The CBS investigation also revealed new information: secret U.S. army reports estimating 1000 civilians killed -- not the 202 that were officially reported -- and urging that damage claims not be considered because the number might mount too high. There was also a (rare) report of thousands of Panamanians protesting against the U.S. invasion and occupation.

<P>While Larry Rohter's visits to the slums destroyed by U.S. bombardment located only celebrants, or critics of U.S. "insensitivity" at worst, others found a rather different picture. Mexico's leading newspaper reported in April that Rafael Olivardia, refugee spokesman for the 15,000 refugees of the devastated El Chorrillo neighborhood, "said that the El bloodbath' during and after saw North American tanks roll over the dead' during the invasion that left a total of more than 2000 dead and thousands injured, according to unofficial figures." "You only live once," Olivardia said, "and if you must die fighting for an adequate home, then the U.S. soldiers should complete the task they began" on December 20.

<P>The Spanish language press in the United States was less celebratory and deferential than its colleagues. Vicky Pelaez reports from Panama that "the entire world continues in ignorance about how the thousands of victims of the Northamerican invasion of Panama died and what kinds of weapons were used, because the Attorney-General of the country refuses to permit investigation of the bodies buried in the common graves." An accompanying photo shows workmen exhuming corpses from a grave containing "almost 200 victims of the invasion." Quoting a woman who found the body of her murdered father, Pelaez reports that "just like the woman vox populi' in Panama that the Northamericans used completely unknown armaments during the 20 December invasion." Olga Mejia, President of Panamanian Human Rights, informed the journal that "They converted Panama into a laboratory of horror. Here, they first experimented with methods of economic strangulation; then they successfully used a campaign of disinformation at the international level. But it was in the application of the most modern war technology that they demonstrated infernal mastery."  The CODEHUCA-CONADEHUPA report also alleges that "the U.S. Army used highly sophisticated weapons -- some for the first time in combat -- against unarmed civilian populations," and "in many cases no distinction was made between civilian and military targets."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.33" HREF="#FN1.33">33</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>One case of "highly sophisticated weapons" did receive some attention. F-117A stealth fighters were used in combat for the first time, dropping 2000-lb. bombs with time-delay mechanisms in a large open field near an airstrip and barracks that housed an elite PDF battalion. The Air Force had kept this plane under close wraps, refusing to release cost or performance data about it. "There were conflicting reports as to the rationale for employing the sophisticated aircraft, which cost nearly $50 million apiece, to conduct what appeared to be a simple operation," <CITE>Aviation Week & Space Technology</CITE> reported. The Panamanian air force has no fighters and no military aircraft were stationed permanently at the base that was attacked. Its only known air defenses "were a pair of aging small caliber antiaircraft guns." An American aeronautical engineering consultant and charter operator in Panama said he was "astonished" to learn of the use of the F-117A, pointing out that the target attacked did not even have radar: "They could have bombed it with any other aircraft and not been noticed." The aerospace journal cites Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's claim that the aircraft were used "because of its great accuracy," then suggesting its own answer to the puzzle: "By demonstrating the F-117A's capability to operate in low-intensity conflicts, as well as its intended mission to attack heavily defended Soviet targets, the operation can be used by the Air Force to justify the huge investment made in stealth technology" to "an increasingly skeptical Congress."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.34" HREF="#FN1.34">34</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>A similar conclusion was reached, more broadly, by Col. (Ret.) David Hackworth, a former combat commander who is one of the nation's most decorated soldiers. He described the Panama operation as technically efficient, though in his judgment "100 Special Forces guys" would have sufficed to capture Noriega, and "this big operation was a Pentagon attempt to impress Congress just when they're starting to cut back on the military." Other evidence lends credibility to these suggestions, including the White House National Security Strategy report presented to Congress in March 1990.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.35" HREF="#FN1.35">35</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>If these were indeed among the motives for the exercise, they may have suffered a slight setback when it turned out that one of the stealth fighter-bombers had missed its undefended target by more than 300 yards, despite its "great accuracy." Defense Secretary Cheney ordered an inquiry.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.36" HREF="#FN1.36">36</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The nature of the U.S. victory became clearer, along predictable lines, in the following months. Its character is described by Andres Oppenheimer in the <CITE>Miami Herald</CITE> in June, under the heading "Panama Flirts with Economic Recovery" -- that is, recovery from the depths to which it was plunged by illegal U.S. economic warfare, then invasion and occupation. But there is a qualification: "Six months after the U.S. invasion, Panama is showing signs of growing prosperity -- at least for the largely white-skinned business class that has regained its influence after more than two decades of military rule," the small minority of important people. The luxury shops are again full of goods, and "Panama's nightlife is also perking up" as "foreign tourists, mostly U.S. businessmen, can be seen most evenings sipping martinis in the lobbies of the biggest hotels," which are sometimes "booked solid -- a contrast to the moribund atmosphere there before the invasion." Newspapers are filled with ads from department stores, banks, and insurance firms. "The upper class and the middle classes are doing great," a Western European diplomat observes: "They had the money in U.S. bank accounts and are bringing it back to the country. But the poor are in bad shape, because the government is bankrupt and can't help them."  "The Catholic Church has begun to denounce what it sees as a lack of government concern for the poor," Oppenheimer continues. An editorial in a Church weekly "lashed out at authorities for devoting their energies to helping the private sector while breaking their original promises not to fire low-income public workers."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.37" HREF="#FN1.37">37</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Chalk up another victory for capitalism and democracy.

<P>On August 2, the Catholic bishops of Panama issued a pastoral letter condemning U.S. "interference in the country's internal affairs" and denouncing the December invasion as "a veritable tragedy in the annals of the country's history." The statement also condemned Washington's failure to provide aid to the people who continue to suffer from the invasion, and criticized the government for ignoring their plight. Their protest appears in the Guatemala City <CITE>Central America Report</CITE> under the heading "Church Raises Its Voice" -- though not loudly enough to be heard in Washington and New York. The same report quotes the Mexican daily <CITE>Excelsior</CITE> on U.S. military maneuvers in the mountains of Panama, and the high visibility of U.S. troops throughout the capital and other areas of the country.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.38" HREF="#FN1.38">38</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>In April, President Endara had appointed a commission (the Panamanian Commission for National Reconstruction) to deal with the problem of reconstructing the economy that had been devastated by the U.S. economic sanctions, then the invasion and its aftermath. Its report, issued in August, proposed a three-point plan: a truce, political amnesty, and the end of "occupation of the State and its territory" by U.S. troops. Special emphasis was placed on the consequences of the U.S. invasion, and the demand for the end to the military occupation and reestablishment of Panamanian sovereignty.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.39" HREF="#FN1.39">39</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>In the British journal <CITE>Race and Class,</CITE> Joy James reviews some relevant history. The White (European) sector, which owns most of the land and resources, is estimated at about 8% of the population. The "two decades of military rule" to which the <CITE>Miami Herald</CITE> refers had some other characteristics as well. The Torrijo dictatorship had a populist character, which largely ended after his death in 1981 in an airplane accident (with various charges about the cause), and the subsequent Noriega takeover. During this period, Blacks, Mestizo, and Indigenous Panamanians gained their first share of power, and economic and land reforms were undertaken. In these two decades, infant mortality declined from 40% to less than 20% and life expectancy increased by nine years. New hospitals, health centers, houses, schools and universities were built, and more doctors, nurses and teachers were trained. Indigenous communities were granted autonomy and protection for their traditional lands, to an extent unmatched in the hemisphere. For the first time, Panama moved to an independent foreign policy, still alive in the 1980s to an extent, as Panama participated in the Contadora peace efforts (one of the main reasons why Noriega was transmuted from good guy to devil). The Canal Treaty was signed in 1977, theoretically awarding control over the Canal to Panama by the year 2000, though the prospects are doubtful. The Reagan administration took the position that "when the Carter-Torrijos treaties are being renegotiated" -- an eventuality taken for granted -- "the prolongation of the US military presence in the Panama Canal area till well after the year 2000 should be brought up for discussion" (State Department).<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.40" HREF="#FN1.40">40</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The post-invasion moves to place Panamanian military forces under U.S. control may be motivated by more than just the normal commitment to this doctrine. It will probably be argued that Panama is not in a position to defend the Canal as the Treaty requires, so that U.S. bases must be retained.

<P>The U.S. sanctions largely dismantled the reforms of the Torrijo period. Poverty rose rapidly, and the unions virtually collapsed. The invasion and the U.S. post-invasion rule are likely to administer the coup de grace to these populist efforts.

<P>In August, government economists warned that more than 300,000 Panamanians are unemployed or underemployed, some 40% of the population. One leading economist and former high government planning official reported that 44% of the population lives in poverty, 24% in "extreme poverty," and that 93,800 infants and pre-school children live "in misery," while 35% of infants are malnourished. To check rising unemployment, he estimates, 190,000 jobs new jobs will be needed this year alone.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.41" HREF="#FN1.41">41</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The problems faced by the usual victims are described out of the mainstream by labor journalist Daphne Wysham. She reports that the U.S. invasion virtually completed the destruction of the Panamanian trade unions. The general secretary of the Inter-American Regional Organization of Workers (ORIT), Luis Anderson, condemned the invading troops for arresting three top Panamanian labor leaders. "Many union offices have been raided and sacked. The journalists union has been banned." These steps by the occupying forces are part of a more general attack on independent politics. In an interview before the invasion, one Panamian labor leader later detained by U.S. troops reported that he and other union leaders were informed by the State Department that they were on a list of people who would be eliminated if they didn't "get their feet in support of the opposition" to Noriega. Union activists interviewed by Joy James report similar pre-invasion threats by the AFL-CIO, which, they say, is now working to create a new "parallel organization" that will be better-behaved, following its traditional union-busting policies..

<P>Teresa Guttierez, a spokesperson for former U.S. Attorney-General Ramsey Clark, who heads a Panamanian inquiry commission, reports that new labor laws disallow the right to hold union meetings, the right to protest, and the right to strike, and that trade unionists are rounded up on a regular basis and held without charges.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.42" HREF="#FN1.42">42</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The same picture emerges from the occasional reports in the mainstream media. Pamela Constable reports that "bankers and business owners" find that things are looking up, though "a mood of anger and desperation permeates the underclass" in "the blighted shantytowns." Vice-president Guillermo Ford says that "The stores have reopened 100 percent, and the private sector is very enthusiastic. I think we're on the road to a very solid future." Under his "proposed recovery program," public enterprises would be sold off, "the labor code would be revised to allow easier dismissal of workers and tax-free export factories would be set up to lure foreign capital."

<P>Business leaders "are bullish on Ford's ideas," Constable continues. In contrast, "Labor unions are understandably wary of these proposals," but "their power has become almost negligible" with "massive dismissals of public workers who supported Noriega and the unprecedented jobless rate." The U.S. emergency aid package approved by Congress is intended largely "to make back payments on Panama's foreign debt and shore up its creditworthiness with foreign lending institutions"; in translation: it is a taxpayer subsidy to international banks, foreign investors, and the important people in Panama. The thousands of refugees from El Chorillo, now living in what some of them call "a concentration camp," will not be returning to the devastated slum. The original owners, who had long wanted "to transform this prime piece of real estate into a posher district," may now be able to do so. Noriega had stood in the way of these plans, allowing the poor to occupy housing there rent-free. But by bombing the neighborhood into rubble and then levelling the charred ruins with bulldozers, U.S. forces overcame "that ticklish legal and human obstacle" to these intentions, Constable reports.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.43" HREF="#FN1.43">43</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>With unemployment skyrocketing, nearly half the population cannot meet essential food needs. Crime has quadrupled. Aid is designated for businesses and foreign banks (debt repayment). It could be called the "Central Americanization" of Panama, correspondent Brook Larmer aptly observes in the <CITE>Christian Science Monitor</CITE>.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.44" HREF="#FN1.44">44</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The U.S. occupying forces continue to leave little to chance. The Mexican journal <CITE>Excelsior</CITE> reports that the U.S. forces have established direct control over ministries and public institutions. According to an organization chart leaked to the journal by political and diplomatic sources, U.S. controls extend to all provinces, the Indian community, the Town Halls of the ten major cities, and the regional police offices. "Washington's objective is to have a strategic network in this country to permanently control all the actions and decisions of the government." With the establishment of this "parallel government" closely controlling all decision-making, "things have returned to the way they were before 1968 in Panama." The journal scheduled an interview with President Endara to discuss the matter, but it was cancelled without explanation.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.45" HREF="#FN1.45">45</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The report provides extensive details, including names of U.S. officials and the tasks assigned them in the organization chart. All of this could easily be checked by U.S. reporters, if home offices were interested. They are not. "The information that we reveal here," <CITE>Excelsior</CITE> reports, "is supposed to be known only to very restricted groups" -- not including the U.S. public.

<P>The regime put in power is to be a well-behaved puppet, with no populist heresies or thoughts of independence. That is the firm policy goal. It might well have been the policy goal of Saddam Hussein in Kuwait, had international sanctions not been applied in outrage over his nefarious aggression. The efficient way, after all, is to rule through locals who can be trusted, with ample force on the ready, just in case.

<P>The occupying forces are not only dedicated to restoring the rule of the traditional European oligarchy and its foreign associates, but also to ensuring that the project is not troubled by such irritants as freedom of expression. <CITE>Excelsior</CITE> reports that "United States intelligence services exercise control not only over local information media but also over international news agencies," according to the president of the Journalist Union of Panama. He adds that the goal is to make the world believe that there is freedom and democracy, whereas in reality broadcast stations have been taken over and placed "in custody" and dozens of journalists have been fired. An opposition activist alleges that the first Panamanian publishing company, ERSA, with three daily papers, was occupied by U.S. tanks and security forces "in order to turn it over to a businessman who had lost it in a lawsuit," a member of an oligarchical family that "favors the interventionist line of the United States."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.46" HREF="#FN1.46">46</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>According to Ramsey Clark's Independent Commission of Inquiry, the offices of the daily <CITE>La Republica</CITE> "were ransacked and looted by U.S. troops the day after the newspaper reported on the large number of deaths caused by the U.S. invasion." Its editor was arrested and held for six weeks by U.S. troops, then sent to a Panamanian prison without charges. The publisher of one of the few opposition voices was arrested in March on charges of alleged misconduct when he was a government minister, and the government closed a radio station for broadcasting editorials critical of the U.S. invasion and the government it established.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.47" HREF="#FN1.47">47</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Miguel Antonio Bernal, a leading Panamanian intellectual and anti-Noriega activist, writes that "freedom of press is again under siege in Panama." Vice-president Ricardo Arias Calderon has proposed a new law to restrict press criticism of the government, saying that "We will not tolerate criticism." He has also urged stockholders of Panama's largest newspaper, <CITE>La Prensa,</CITE> to fire its editor and founder Roberto Eisenman because of the journal's criticism of the government, and has called on members of his Christian Democratic Party to work for Eisenman's ouster.  Describing such acts, the increasing terror, and the reconstruction of the military with Noriega associates who were implicated in drug running and corruption, Bernal asks why the U.S. is "turning the same blind eye" as in the past to these developments.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.48" HREF="#FN1.48">48</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Bernal's question is surely rhetorical. Latin Americans know the answer very well, though the question could hardly be addressed in the fanatically ideological intellectual culture to the North.

<P>Not only the military, but the bankers and businessmen restored to power in the December invasion as well had close links to the drug trade. Justice Department and Senate inquiries had identified Panamanian banks as major conduits for drug money in the early 1980s, when Noriega was still a great friend, and high officials of the new government, including President Endara, were closely involved with banks charged with money laundering as directors or in other ways. In September, the U.S. Embassy "implicated President Endara in a money laundering scheme" (<CITE>Central America Report,</CITE> Guatemala). DEA officials accused 7 Panamanian banks of laundering drug money and protecting the accounts of drug-traffickers, including the Interbanco, directed by Endara until he took over the presidency in January 1990, which was charged with protecting millions of dollars belonging to Colombian druglord Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha (since killed). U.S. Ambassador Hinton charged further that the "Colombian mafia" continues to use Panama for drug shipment to Europe and the United States. At the heart of the controversy is a U.S. demand for access to information about bank depositors in Panama, which the financial community there claims would undermine the international banking sector by eliminating confidentiality (and might be used for the U.S. for its own purposes under a drug cover). The alleged U.S. concerns about drug trafficking might be a bit more credible if we were to witness raids by Delta Force on the executive headquarters of the U.S. corporations that supply the drug cartel with the chemicals they need for cocaine production -- or if the U.S. government were not applying strong pressures on Asian countries to remove barriers on advertising and marketing of lethal addictive drugs produced in the United States (tobacco, a far worse killer than cocaine).<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.49" HREF="#FN1.49">49</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Those not restricted to the quality press here will also learn that President Endara's government received "one of its worst diplomatic setbacks" on March 30, when it was formally ousted from the Group of Eight (now Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay, Venezuela), what are considered the major Latin American democracies. Panama had been suspended from the group in 1988 in reaction to Noriega's repression, and with the further deterioration of the political climate under foreign occupation, Panama was ousted permanently at the March meeting of foreign ministers. The Group of Eight, now Seven, issued a resolution stating that "the process of democratic legitimation in Panama requires popular consideration without foreign interference, that guarantees the full right of the people to freely choose their governments." The resolution also indicated that the operations of the U.S. military are affecting Panama's sovereignty and independence as well as the legality of the Endara government. This decision extends the pattern of strong Latin American opposition to the earlier U.S. measures against Panama and the invasion, from the outset, when the Organization of American States condemned U.S. moves by a vote of 17-1 (U.S. opposed) in July 1987. As the media here barely noted, President Endara's inaugural address four weeks after the invasion was boycotted by virtually all Latin American ambassadors.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.50" HREF="#FN1.50">50</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The Washington-media position is that the Endara government is legitimate, having won the 1989 elections that were stolen by Noriega. Latin American opinion commonly takes a different view.

<P>In 1989, Endara was running against Noriega, with extensive U.S. backing, open and covert. Furthermore, the elections were conducted under conditions caused by the illegal U.S. economic warfare that was demolishing the economy. The United States was therefore holding a whip over the electorate. For that reason alone the elections were far from free and uncoerced, by any sensible standards. Today, the political scene is quite different -- or would be, if the U.S. were to tolerate political activity and free expression. On these grounds, there would be every reason to organize a new election, contrary to the wishes of Endara and his U.S. sponsors. Polls in Panama show that over half the population would vote for a new party or new alliance if elections were to be permitted.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.51" HREF="#FN1.51">51</A></FONT></SUP> The official position is offered by Michael Massing in the <CITE>New York Review of Books</CITE>. Reporting from Panama, he writes that Endara's willingness to "go along" with the U.S. request that he assume the presidency "has caused the leaders of some Latin American countries, such as Peru, to question his legitimacy." "The Panamanians themselves, however, have few such qualms," because his "clear victory" in the 1989 election "provided Endara with all the credentials he needs." Citation of Peru for dragging its feet is a deft move, since President Garcia was an official enemy of the U.S. who had been recalcitrant about Nicaragua, had restricted debt payment, and in general failed to observe proper standards; best to overlook the rest of the Group of Eight, however, among "some Latin American countries." As for the views of "the Panamanians themselves," no further indication is given as to how this information was obtained.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.52" HREF="#FN1.52">52</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Massing reports on the police raids in poor neighborhoods, the protests of homeless and hungry people demanding jobs and housing, the reconstruction of Noriega's PDF, the restoration of the oligarchy with a "successful corporate lawyer" at the head of a government "largely made up of businessmen," who receive U.S.  corporate visitors sponsored by OPIC (which ensures U.S. investments abroad) "as if they were visiting heads of state." The business climate is again "attractive" in this "land ruled by merchants, marketers, and moneylenders." "The government is drafting plans to revive Panama's banking industry, relax its labor laws, expand the free trade zone, and attract foreign investors," and to privatize state enterprises and "radically cut public spending."

<P>Drawn from the "tiny white elite" of under 10% of the population, the government has been accused of "wanting to turn the clock back to 1968, when a small rich group ruled the country" -- namely, exactly the group now restored to power. But "the charge is unfair," Massing comments -- much like the charge that the conservative populists swept into office in the democratic wave of free elections in Central America might have something on their minds other than helping the poor when they opt for a trickle-down strategy. The proof that the charge is unfair, Massing explains, is that when employees from Air Panama fearful of losing their jobs held a vigil outside his office, President Endara "sent them coffee and made a point of talking with them."  What is more, while fasting in the Cathedral in an effort to expedite U.S. aid (or to lose weight, some unkind locals quipped), "he invited striking sanitation workers in for a chat and eventually negotiated a settlement." Furthermore, Vice-President Arias Calderon has said that he wants the government to correct disparities created by the market. True, no projects that might illustrate these plans "are in the works" and the Endara government "opposes the idea" of using U.S. aid for such purposes, "determined to leave virtually everything to the private sector." But that proves nothing, in the face of the powerful evidence showing that "the charge is unfair," just reviewed in its entirety.

<P>Massing is not pleased with the outcome, particularly, the restoration of Noriega's PDF, "despite all the good intentions" of the United States (taken as given, in accordance with the norms of the intellectual culture), and its efforts "to atone for its past misbehavior." The problem does not lie in the U.S. military aid programs, which have trained security forces that "have been guilty of horrible excesses" in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Noriega's Panama (and other cases unmentioned). Rather, the problem lies in what the U.S. "had to work with." It's those folks who are bad, not us, please.

<P>The consistent effects of our military training, the policies of which it is a part, the documentary record explaining the reasons -- all may be put aside, irrelevant, along with all of history. We are always willing to admit that there were aberrations in the past. But at every moment of time, we have changed course and put the errors of the past behind us.

<P>We are Good, our intentions are Good. Period.

<H1>The Victors, Part II</H1>
<CITE>Z Magazine,</CITE> January 1991
</CENTER>


<P>The first part of this series (<CITE>Z,</CITE> November) opened with the conventional interpretation of the past decade: the U.S. won the Cold War, a victory for the forces of righteousness. We then turned to the question that would at once come to the mind of anyone apart from the most fanatic ideologue: How are the victors faring at this historic moment, as they celebrate their triumph? We looked first at those who should be the most overjoyed because of their unusual good fortune: our "little brown brothers" in Central America and Panama, who have long been under the protective wing of the leader of the crusade, becoming a foreign policy obsession in the past decade. The conditions of their existence help us understand why the obvious questions about the Grand Victory of democracy and free market capitalism are so scrupulously avoided in polite and cultivated circles. Needless to say, the beneficiaries of our solicitude have some thoughts of their own about these matters. We will turn in the final section to their interpretation of the triumph of capitalism and freedom, and the nobility of their protector -- thoughts that do not penetrate the well-disciplined commissar culture at home.

<P>Let us now extend the survey to other regions where the virtuous leaders of the crusade for freedom and justice have long held sway and have thus been able to realize their noble objectives with no more than marginal interference from Communists and other evil forces, beginning with the rest of Latin America.


<H3>The Fruits Of Victory: Latin America</H3>

<P>A World Bank study in 1982 estimated that "40 percent of households in Latin America live in poverty, meaning that they cannot purchase the minimum basket of goods required for the satisfaction of their basic needs, and...20 percent of all households live in destitution, meaning that they lack the means of buying even the food that would provide them with a minimally adequate diet." The situation became far worse through the victorious 1980s, largely because of the huge export of capital to the West. From 1982 to 1987 this amounted to about $250 billion, 25 times the total value of the Alliance for Progress and 15 times the Marshall Plan. The Bank for International Settlements in Switzerland estimates that between 1978 and 1987, some $170 billion in flight capital left Latin America, not including money hidden by falsified trade transactions. The New York Times cites another estimate that anonymous capital flows, including drug money and flight capital, total $600 billion to $800 billion.

<P>This huge hemorrhage is part of a complicated system whereby Western banks and Latin American elites enrich themselves at the expense of the general population of Latin America, which is saddled with the "debt crisis" that results from these manipulations, and of taxpayers in the Western countries who are ultimately called upon to foot part of the bill. These are among the triumphs of free market capitalism that we now celebrate -- apart from a few perpetual complainers who are "as welcome as gnats at a nudist party," a New York Times reviewer comments, referring to Murray Bookchin.

<P>Speaking in Washington in preparation for the 1989 General Assembly of the OAS, which he headed, Brazilian President Soares described the 1980s as a "lost decade" for Latin America, with falling personal income and general economic stagnation or decline. In 1988 average income had fallen to the level of 1978. There was a further decline in 1989, and the export of capital continued in a flood, the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean reported.

<P>According to World Bank figures, average per capita income in Argentina fell from $1,990 in 1980 to $1,630 in 1988. Mexico's GNP declined for seven straight years. Real wages in Venezuela has fallen by a third since 1981, to the 1964 level. Argentina allotted 20 percent of its budget to education in 1972, 6 percent in 1986. David Felix, a leading specialist on Latin American economics, writes that per capita output and real investment per worker declined sharply in the 1980s, the latter falling to below 1970 levels in most of the heavily indebted countries, where urban real wages are in many cases 20 percent to 40 percent below 1980 levels, even below 1970 levels.  The brain drain quickened and physical and human capital per head shrank because of the decline of public and private investment and collapse of infrastructure. Much of the sharp deterioration of the 1980s, Felix and others conclude, can be traced to the free-market restructuring imposed by the industrial powers.

<P>Mexicans continue to flee to the United States for survival, and macabre stories abound, some hard to believe but important for what they indicate about the prevailing mood. Reporting the annual meeting of the Border Commission on Human Rights in Mexico, Mexico's leading daily (Excelsior) alleges that actions of the U.S. Border Patrol cause the drowning of persons seeking to cross the river to the United States. A representative of the regional Human Rights Committee told the session that 1,000 people had disappeared without a trace after leaving their homes to enter the U.S. illegally. She "also added that the disappearance or theft of women for the extraction of organs for use in transplants in the U.S. is common." Others reported torture, high rates of cancer from chemicals used in the maquiladora industries (mainly subsidiaries of transnationals supplying U.S. factories), secret prisons, kidnapping, and other horror stories. The journal also reports a study by environmental groups, presented to President Salinas, claiming that 100,000 children die every year as a result of pollution in the Mexico City area, along with millions suffering from pollution-induced disease, which has reduced life expectancy by an estimated 10 years. The "main culprit" is the emissions of lead and sulfur from operations of the national petrochemical company Pemex, which is free from the controls imposed elsewhere -- one of the advantages of Third World production that is not lost on investors.

<P>The Mexican Secretariat of Urban Development and the Environment described the situation as "truly catastrophic," Excelsior reports further, estimating that less than 10 percent of Mexican territory is able to support "minimally productive agriculture" because of environmental degradation, while water resources are hazardously low.  Many areas are turning into "a real museum of horrors" from pollution because of the blind pursuit of profits on the part of national and international private capital. The Secretariat estimates further that more than 90 percent of industry in the Valley of Mexico, where there are more than 30,000 plants, violate global standards, and in the chemical industry, more than half the labor force suffers irreversible damage to the respiratory system.

<P>Maude Barlow, chairperson of a Canadian study group, reports the results of their inquiry into maquiladoras "built by Fortune 500 to take advantage of a desperate people," for profits hard to match elsewhere. They found factories full of teenage girls, some 14-years-old, "working at eye-damaging, numbingly repetitive work" for wages "well below what is required for even a minimum standard of living." Corporations commonly send the most dangerous jobs here because standards on chemicals are "lax or non-existent." "In one plant," she writes, "we all experienced headaches and nausea from spending an hour on the assembly line" and "we saw young girls working beside open vats of toxic waste, with no protective face covering."  Unions are barred, and there is an ample reserve army of desperate people ready to take the place of any who "are not happy, or fall behind in quotas, or become ill or pregnant." The delegation "took pictures of a lagoon of black, bubbling toxic waste dumped by plants in an industrial park," following it to "where it met untreated raw sewage and turned into a small river running past squatters' camps (where children covered in sores drank Pepsi Cola from baby bottles) to empty into the Tijuana River."

<P>It is more fashionable to bemoan the environmental and human catastrophes of Eastern Europe, the results of an evil system now happily overcome in a victory for our humane values.

<P>Colombia is another success story of capitalist democracy, flawed only by the drug cartels -- and for some of those gnats who still fail to appreciate the wonders of our system, by such marginal problems as the murder of "subversives" -- such as 1,000 members of the leading opposition party and 3 of its presidential candidates -- by death squads in league with the security forces.

<P>There is also a background, though one would be hard put to find a discussion of it in recent commentary on U.S. efforts to aid the Colombian military in the "war against drugs." The topic is addressed in a discussion of human rights in Colombia by Alfredo Vasquez Carrizosa, president of the Colombian Permanent Committee for Human Rights. "Behind the facade of a constitutional regime," he observes, "we have a militarized society under the state of siege provided" by the 1886 Constitution. The Constitution grants a wide range of rights, but they have no relation to reality. "In this context poverty and insufficient land reform have made Colombia one of the most tragic countries of Latin America." Land reform, which "has practically been a myth," was legislated in 1961, but "has yet to be implemented, as it is opposed by landowners, who have had the power to stop it" -- again, no defect of `'democracy," by Western standards. The result of the prevailing misery has been violence, including <I>la Violencia</I> of the 1940s and 1950s, which took hundreds of thousands of lives. "This violence has been caused not by any mass indoctrination, but by the dual structure of a prosperous minority and an impoverished, excluded majority, with great differences in political participation," the familiar story.

<P>The story has another familiar thread. "But in addition to internal factors," Vasquez Carrizosa continues, "violence has been exacerbated by external factors. In the 1960s the United States, during the Kennedy administration, took great pains to transform our regular armies into counterinsurgency brigades, accepting the new strategy of the death squads." These Kennedy initiatives "ushered in what is known in Latin America as the National Security Doctrine, ...not defense against an external enemy, but a way to make the military establishment the masters of the game... [with] the right to combat the internal enemy, as set forth in the Brazilian doctrine, the Argentine doctrine, the Uruguayan doctrine, and the Colombian doctrine: it is the right to fight and to exterminate social workers, trade unionists, men and women who are not supportive of the establishment, and who are assumed to be communist extremists. And this could mean anyone, including human rights activists such as myself."

<P>A study by Evan Vallianatos of the U.S. government Office of Technology Assessment amplifies the dimensions of the victory of capitalist democracy here. "Colombia's twentieth century history is above all stained in the blood of the peasant poor," he writes, reviewing the gruesome record of atrocities and massacre to keep the mass of the population in its place. The U.S. Aid program, the Ford Foundation, and others have sought to deal with the plight of the rural population "by refining the largely discredited trickle-down technology and knowledge transfer process," investing in the elite and trusting in "competition, private property, and the mechanism of the free market" -- a system in which "the big fish eats the small one," as one poor farmer observes. These policies have made the dreadful conditions still worse, creating "the most gross inequalities that the beast in man has made possible." It is not only the rural poor who have suffered beyond endurance. To illustrate the kind of development fostered by the multinational corporations and the technocrats, Vallianatos offers the example of the small industrial city of Yumbo, "rapidly becoming unfit for human habitation" because of uncontrolled pollution, decay, and "corrosive slums" in which "the town's spent humanity has all but given up."

<P>Another victory for our side.

<P>Brazil is another country with rich resources and potential, long subject to European influence, then U.S. intervention, primarily since the Kennedy years. We cannot, however, simply speak of "Brazil."  There are two very different Brazils. In a major scholarly study of the Brazilian economy, Peter Evans writes that "the fundamental conflict in Brazil is between the 1, or perhaps 5, percent of the population that comprises the elite and the 80 percent that has been left out of the `Brazilian model' of development." The Brazilian journal <CITE>Veja</CITE> reports on these two Brazils, the first modern and westernized, the second sunk in the deepest misery. Seventy percent of the population consumes fewer calories than Iranians, Mexicans, or Paraguayans. Over half the population have family incomes below the minimum wage. For 40 percent of the population, the median annual salary is $287, while inflation skyrockets and necessities are beyond reach. A World Bank report on the Brazilian educational system compares it unfavorably to Ethiopia and Pakistan, with a dropout rate of 80 percent in primary school, growing illiteracy, and falling budgets. The Ministry of Education reports that the government spends over a third of the education budget on school meals, because most of the students will either eat at school or not at all.

<P>The journal South, which describes itself as "The Business Magazine of the Developing World," reports on Brazil under the heading "The Underside of Paradise." A country with enormous wealth, no security concerns, a relatively homogeneous population, and a favorable climate, Brazil nevertheless has problems: "The problem is that this cornucopia is inhabited by a population enduring social conditions among the worst in the world. Two-thirds do not get enough to eat.  Brazil has a higher infant mortality rate than Sri Lanka, a higher illiteracy rate than Paraguay, and worse social indicators than many far poorer African countries. Fewer children finish first-grade school than in Ethiopia, fewer are vaccinated than in Tanzania and Botswana. Thirty-two percent of the population lives below the poverty line. Seven million abandoned children beg, steal and sniff glue on the streets. For scores of millions, home is a shack in a slum, a room in the inner city, or increasingly, a patch of ground under a bridge."

<P>The share of the poorer classes in the national income is "steadily falling, giving Brazil probably the highest concentration of income in the world." It has no progressive income tax or capital gains tax, but it does have galloping inflation and a huge foreign debt, while participating in a "Marshall Plan in reverse," in the words of former President Jose Samey, referring to debt payments.

<P>For three-quarters of the population of this cornucopia, the conditions of Eastern Europe are dreams beyond reach, another triumph of the Free World.

<P>A UN "Report on Human Development" ranks Brazil, with the world's eighth-largest economy, in 80th place in general welfare (as measured by education, health, and hygiene), near Albania, Paraguay, and Thailand. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) announced on October 18 that more than 40 percent of the population (almost 53 million people) are hungry. The Brazilian Health Ministry estimates that 840,000 children aged 1-4 and 420,000 newborns will die of hunger this year.

<P>Here too it is widely alleged that babies are sacrificed for organ banks, a belief that can hardly be true but that reveals much about the conditions under which it can take root. The Honduran press reported that Brazilian babies had been rescued from a gang that "intended to sacrifice them to organ banks in the United States, according to a charge in the courts." Brazil's Justice Ministry ordered federal police to investigate allegations that adopted children are being used for organ transplants in Europe, a practice "known to exist in Mexico and Thailand," the London Guardian reports, adding that "handicapped children are said to be preferred for transplant operations" and reviewing the process by which children in Brazil are kidnapped, "disappeared," or given up by impoverished mothers, then adopted or used for transplants.

<P>It would only be fair to add that the authorities are concerned with the mounting problem of homeless and starving children and are trying to reduce their numbers. Amnesty International reports that death squads, often run by the police, are killing street children at a rate of about one a day, while "many more children, forced onto the streets to support their families, are being beaten and tortured by the police" (Reuters, citing AI). "Poor children in Brazil are treated with contempt by the authorities, risking their lives simply by being on the streets," AI alleges. Most of the torture takes place under police custody or in state institutions. There are few complaints by victims or witnesses because of fear of the police, and the few cases that are investigated judicially result in light sentences.

<P>Recall that these are the conditions that hold on the 25th anniversary of "the single most decisive victory of freedom in the mid-twentieth century" (Kennedy Ambassador Lincoln Gordon), that is, the overthrow of parliamentary democracy by Brazilian generals backed by the United States, which then praised the "economic miracle" produced by the neo-Nazi national security state they established. In the months before the generals' coup, Washington assured its traditional military allies of its support and provided them with aid, because the military was essential to "the strategy for restraining left-wing excesses" of the elected Goulart government, Gordon cabled the State Department. The U.S. actively supported the coup, preparing to intervene directly if its help was needed for what Gordon described as the "democratic rebellion" of the generals. This "de facto ouster" of the elected president was "a great victory for the free world," Gordon reported with joy, adding that it should "create a greatly improved climate for private investment." U.S. labor leaders also demanded their proper share of the credit for the overthrow of the parliamentary regime, as the new government placed in power by the generals proceeded to smash the labor movement and subordinate poor and working people to the overriding needs of business interests, primarily foreign. Secretary of State Dean Rusk justified U.S. recognition for the obviously illegal regime on the grounds that "the succession there occurred as foreseen by the [Brazilian] Constitution," which had just been blatantly violated. The U.S. proceeded to provide ample aid as torture and repression mounted, the relics of constitutional Government faded away, and the climate for investors improved under the rule of what Washington hailed as the "democratic forces."

<P>These events in Latin America's most powerful state initiated a domino effect throughout the continent, leading to an unprecedented plague of repression under the National Security doctrines crafted by the military and political leaders of the hemisphere and their U.S.  advisers.

<P>The circumstances of the poor in Brazil continue to regress as austerity measures are imposed on the standard International Monetary Fund formula in an effort to deal somehow with this catastrophe of capitalism. The austerity measures initiated by President Collor de Mello were initially described as "populist," harmful mostly to the wealthy. Predictably, reality took a different course. Ken Silverstein reports that half a year after the measures were inaugurated, "the rich are reassured." The IMF measures primarily harmed the poor, while wealthy individuals and large companies were able to find ways to enrich themselves by exploiting measures that in theory were devised to impose the main burden on them. A study by the J. Walter Thompson agency concluded that "Collor's policies are not a threat to the wealthy.... The rich are now leading absolutely normal lives" (agency vice-president Celia Chiavolle). Businessmen, bankers, and the U.S.  Chamber of Commerce express their pleasure in the course of policy, while "the working class has been pushed to the wall," Silverstein adds, with hundreds of thousands fired and purchasing power reduced to a historic low, well below minimal needs for about half the population.

<P>The situation is similar in Argentina, where the Christian Democratic Party called on its members to resign from the cabinet in March "in order not to validate, by their presence in the government, the anti-popular [economic] measures of the regime." In a further protest over these measures, the Party expelled the current Minister of the Economy. Experts say that the socioeconomic situation has become "unbearable."

<P>The terrible fate of Argentina is addressed in a report in the Washington Post by Eugene Robinson. One of the ten richest countries in the world at the turn of the century, with rich resources and great advantages, Argentina is becoming a Third World country, Robinson observes. About one-third of its 31 million inhabitants live below the poverty line. Some 18,000 children die each year before their first birthday, most from malnutrition and preventable disease The capital, once considered "the most elegant and European city this side of the Atlantic," is "ringed by a widening belt of shantytowns, called <I>villas miserias,</I> or `miseryvilles,' where the homes are cobbled- together huts and the sewers are open ditches." Here too the IMF-style reforms "have made life even more precarious for the poor"

<P>Robinson's article is paired with another entitled "A Glimpse Into the Lower Depths," devoted to a mining town in the Soviet Union Subtitled "A mining town on the steppes reveals `the whole sick system'," the article stresses the comparison to capitalist success. The article on Argentina, however, says nothing about any "sick system." The only hint of a reason for the catastrophe in Argentina, or the general "economic malaise" in Latin America, is in a statement by a planning minister that "we destroyed ourselves" by "economic mismanagement."  Again the usual pattern: their crimes reveal their evil nature, ours are the result of personal failings and the poor human material with which we are forced to work in the Third World.

<P>David Felix concludes that Argentina's decline results from "political factors such as prolonged class warfare and a lack of national commitment on the part of Argentina's elite," which took advantage of the free-market policies of the murderous military dictatorship that were much admired here. These led to massive redistribution of income towards the wealthy and a sharp fall of per capita income, along with a huge increase in debt as a result of capital flight, tax evasion, and consumption by the rich beneficiaries of the "sick system" -- Reaganomics, in essence.

<P>In oil-rich Venezuela, over 40 percent live in extreme poverty according to official figures, and the food situation is considered "hyper-critical," the Chamber of Food Industries reported in 1989.  Malnutrition is so common that it is often not noted in medical histories, according to hospital officials, who warn that "the future is horrible." Prostitution has also increased, reaching the level of about 170,000 women or more, according to the Ministry of Health. The Ministry also reports an innovation, beyond the classic prostitution of women of low in-come. Many "executive secretaries and housewives and college students accompany tourists and executives during a weekend, earning at times up to [about $150] per contact."  Child prostitution is also increasing and is now "extremely widespread," along with child abuse.

<P>Brutal exploitation of women is a standard feature of the "economic miracles" in the realms of capitalist democracy. The huge flow of women from impoverished rural areas in Thailand to service the prostitution industry -- one of the success stories of the economic takeoff sparked by the Indochina wars -- is one of the many scandals that escape notice in the admiration for the Free World triumph. The savage conditions of work for young women largely from the rural areas are notorious; >young< women, because few others are capable of enduring the conditions of labor, or survive to continue with it.

<P>Chile under the Pinochet dictatorship is another famous success story.  Under the heading "Tyrant's `Success' Leaves 7 of 12 Million Chileans Poor," Antonio Garza Morales reports in Excelsior that "the social cost which has been paid by the Chilean people is the highest in Latin America," with the number of poor rising from 1 million after Allende to 7 million today, while the population remained stable at 12 million. Christian Democratic Party leader Senator Anselmo Sule, returned from exile, says that economic growth that benefits 10 percent of the population has been achieved (Pinochet's official institutions agree), but development has not. Unless the economic disaster for the majority is remedied, "we are finished," he adds. According to David Felix, "Chile, hit especially hard in the 1982-84 period, is now growing faster than during the preceding decade of the Chicago Boys," enthralled by the free market ideology that is, indeed, highly beneficial for some: the wealthy, crucially including foreign investors. Chile's recovery, Felix argues, can be traced to "a combination of severe wage repression by the Pinochet regime, an astutely managed bailout of the bankrupt private sector by the economic team that replaced the discredited Chicago Boys, and access to unusually generous lending by the international financial institutions," much impressed by the favorable climate for business operations.

<P>Environmental degradation is also a severe problem in Chile. The Chilean journal Apsi devoted a recent issue to the environmental crisis accelerated by the "radical neoliberalism" of the period following the U.S.-backed coup that overthrew the parliamentary democracy. Recent studies show that about half the country is becoming a desert, a problem that "seems much farther away than the daily poisoning of those who live in Santiago," the capital city, which competes with Sao Paolo (Brazil) and Mexico City for the pollution prize for the hemisphere (for the world, the journal alleges). "The liquid that emerges from the millions of faucets in the homes and alleys of Santiago have levels of copper, iron, magnesium and lead which exceed by many times the maximum tolerable norms." The land that "supplies the fruits and vegetables of the Metropolitan Region are irrigated with waters that exceed by 1,000 times the maximum quantity of coliforms acceptable," which is why Santiago "has levels of hepatitis, typhoid, and parasites which are not seen in any other part of the continent" (one of every three children has parasites in the capital). Economists and environmentalists attribute the problem to the "development model," crucially, its "transnational style," "in which the most important decisions tend to be adopted outside the ambit of the countries themselves," consistent with the assigned "function" of the Third World: to serve the needs of the industrial West.

<P>The fashion at home, as noted, is to attribute the problems of Eastern Europe to the "sick system" (quite accurately), while ignoring the catastrophes of capitalism or, on the rare occasions when some problem is noticed, attributing it to any cause other than the system that consistently brings it about. Latin American economists who have attributed the problems of the region to the "development model" are generally ignored, but some of them have been useful for ideological warfare and therefore have attained respectability in the U.S.  political culture. One example is Francisco Mayorga, a Yale Ph.D. in economics, who became one of the most respected commentators on the economic affairs of Nicaragua in the 1980s because he could be quoted on the economic debacle caused by the Sandinistas. He remained a U.S.  favorite as he became the economic Czar after the victory for the U.S.  candidate in the February 1990 election, though he disappeared from view when he was removed after the failure of his highly-touted recovery policies (which failed, in large part, because of U.S.  foot-dragging, the UNO government being nowhere near harsh and brutal enough for Washington's tastes).

<P>But Mayorga was never quoted on what he actually wrote about the Nicaraguan economy, which is not without interest. His 1986 Yale doctoral dissertation is a study of the consequences for Nicaragua of the development model of the U.S.-backed Somoza regime, and of the likely consequences of alternative policy choices for the 1980s. He concludes that "by 1978 the economy was on the verge of collapse" because of the "exhaustion of the agroindustrial model" and the "monetarist paradigm" that the U.S. favored. This model had led to huge debt and insolvency, and "the drastic downturn of the terms of trade that was around the corner was clearly going to deal a crucial blow to the agroindustrial model developed in the previous three decades," leading "inexorably" to an "economic slump in the 1980s." The immense costs of the U.S.-backed Somoza repression of 1978-9 and the contra war made the "inexorable" even more destructive. Mayorga estimates capital flight from 1977 to 1979 at $500 million, and calculates the "direct economic burden" of war from 1978 to 1984 at more than $3.3 billion. That figure, he points out, is one and a half times the "record GDP level of the country in 1977," a year of "exceptional affluence" because of the destruction of the Brazilian coffee crop, hence regularly used by U.S. propagandists (including some who masquerade as scholars) as a base line to prove Sandinista failures. The course of the economy from 1980, Mayorga concludes, was the result of the collapse of the agroindustrial export model, the severe downturn in the terms of trade, and the unbearable burden of the 1978-9 war and then the contra war (his study ends before the U.S. embargo exacerbated the crisis further). Sandinista policies, he concludes, were ineffective in dealing with the "inexorable" collapse: they "had a favorable impact on output and a negative effect on rural wages and farming profits," favoring industrial profits and redistributing income "from the rural to the urban sector." Had there been "no war and no change in economic regime," his studies show, "the Nicaraguan economy would have entered a sharp slump."

<P>These conclusions being useless or worse, Mayorga's actual work on the Nicaraguan economy passes into the same oblivion as all other inquiries into the catastrophes of capitalism. The example is noteworthy because of Mayorga's prominence, at the very same time, insofar as he could serve a propaganda function for the media.


<H3>The Fruits Of Victory: The Caribbean</H3>

<P>Brazil and Chile are not the only countries to have basked in praise for their achievements after U.S. intervention set them on the right course. Another is the Dominican Republic. After the latest U.S.  invasion under Lyndon Johnson in 1965, and a dose of death squads and torture, democratic forms were established, and U.S. commentators have expressed much pride in the peaceful transfer of power -- or better, governmental authority, power lying elsewhere. The economy is stagnant and near bankrupt, public services function only intermittently, poverty is endemic, malnutrition is increasing, and the standard of living of the poor continues its downward slide. In the capital city, electricity supply is down to four hours a day; water is available for only an hour a day in many areas. Unemployment is rising, the foreign debt has reached $4 billion, the 1989 trade deficit was $1 billion, up from $700 million the year before. Estimates of the number who have fled illegally to the U.S. range up to a million. Without the remittances of Dominicans working in Puerto Rico and on the U.S.  mainland -- illegally for the most part -- "the country could not survive," the London Economics reports.

<P>U.S. investors, assisted by Woodrow Wilson's invasion and its aftermath, later Johnson's, had long controlled most of the economy.  Now foreign investment in 17 free trade zones is attracted by 15-year tax holidays and average wages of 65 cents an hour. Some "remain upbeat about the Dominican Republic's situation," the Business Magazine of the Developing World (South) reports, citing U.S.  ambassador Paul Taylor, who described the new free trade zones as an economic miracle in a talk to the chamber of commerce. There are some objective grounds for Taylor's cheerful view of the prospects, South observes: "Optimists point to the political and labour harmony in the Dominican Republic, the substantial pool of cheap workers and the transport, banking and communications services as continuing strong incentives to investors. Indeed, as a Dominican factory manager notes: `Anyone who gets involved in unions here knows that they'll lose their job and won't work in the free trade zone any more.' "

<P>As in Brazil and elsewhere, the American Institute for Free Labor Development (AIFLD), the AFL-CIO foreign affairs arm supported by the government and major corporations, "has been instrumental in discouraging hostile [sic] union activity in order to help U.S. companies maximise their profits," South reports. With friends like these, Dominican workers have little to fear.

<P>A more recent beneficiary of U.S. invasion, Panama, also has its share of optimists, as discussed in the first part of this series, notably the tiny white minority now restored to power and the U.S.  businesspeople who have revived Panama City's night-life. As elsewhere in Latin America, the plight of the unimportant people is deplored by sections of the Church who persist in their old-fashioned "preferential option for the poor," not understanding the merits of the promising new "trickle down" techniques of raising them from their misery.

<P>Elsewhere in the Caribbean basin, we find much the same picture, including Grenada, also liberated by U.S. benevolence, then restored to its proper status (see my article in Z, March 1990). The U.S.  pursued a different path to ensure virtuous behavior in the case of Jamaica. Upstarts led by the social democrat Michael Manley and his People's National Party (PNP) sought to explore the forbidden path of independent development and social reform in the 1970s, eliciting the usual hostility from the United States and sufficient pressures to achieve an electoral victory for U.S. favorite Edward Seaga, who pledged to put an end to such nonsense. Seaga's pursuit of proper free market principles was lauded by the Reagan administration, which announced grandly that it would use this opportunity to create a showcase for democracy and capitalism in the Caribbean. Massive aid flowed. USAID spent more on Jamaica than on any other Caribbean program. The World Bank also joined in to oversee and expedite this estimable project. Seaga followed all the rules, introducing austerity measures, establishing Free Trade Zones where non-union labor, mostly women, work in sweatshops for miserable wages in foreign-run plants subsidized by the Jamaican government, and generally keeping to the IMF prescriptions.

<P>There was some economic growth, "mainly as a result of laundered `ganja' dollars from the marijuana trade, increased tourism earnings, lower fuel import costs, and higher prices for bauxite and alumina," the North American Congress on Latin America (NACLA) reports. The rest was the usual catastrophe of capitalism, including one of the highest per capita foreign debts in the world, collapse of infrastructure, and general impoverishment. According to USAID, by March 1988, along with its "crippling debt burden," Jamaica was a country where economic output was "far below the production level of 1972," "distribution of wealth and income is highly unequal," "shortages of key medical and technical personnel plague the health system," "physical decay and social violence deter investment," and there are "severe deficits in infrastructure and housing." The assessment was made six months before hurricane Gilbert dealt a further blow.

<P>At this point, Michael Manley, now properly tamed, was granted the right to return to power to administer the ruins, all hope for constructive change having been lost. Manley "is making all the right noises" to reassure the Bank and foreign investors, Roger Robinson, World Bank senior economist for Jamaica, said in a June 1988 pre-election interview. He explained further that "Five years ago, people were still thinking about `meeting local needs,' but not any more. Now the lawyers and others with access to resources are interested in external export investment. Once you have that ingrained in a population, you can't go back easily, even if the PNP and Michael Manley come in again. Now there's an understanding among individuals who save, invest, and develop their careers that capital will start leaving again if the PNP, or even [Seaga's] JLP, intervenes too much."

<P>Returned to office, Manley recognized the handwriting on the wall, outdoing Seaga as an enthusiast for free market capitalism. "The old gospel that government should be operated in the interests of the poor is being modified, even if not expressly rejected, by the dawning realization that the only way to help the poor is to operate the government in the interest of the productive!" the journal of the Private Sector of Jamaica exulted -- here the term "productive" does not refer to the people who produce, but to those who manage, control investment, and reap profits. The public sector is "on the verge of collapse," the Private Sector report continues, with schools, health care and other services rapidly declining. But with the "nonsensical rhetoric of the recent past" abandoned, and privatization of everything in sight on the way, there is hope -- for "the productive," in the special intended sense.

<P>Manley has won new respect from the important people now that he has learned to play the role of "violin president," in Latin American terminology: "put up by the left but played by the right." The conditions of capital flight and foreign pressures -- state, private, and international economic institutions -- have regularly sufficed to bar any other course.


<H3>The Fruits Of Victory: Asia</H3>

<P>Turning to Asia, a serious inquiry into the victory of freedom, capitalism, and democracy will naturally begin with the Philippines, which has benefited from U.S. solicitude for close to a century. The desperate state of Filipinos is reviewed in the Far Eastern Economic Review, firmly dedicated to economic liberalism and the priorities of the business community, under the heading "Power to the plutocrats."  Its reports conclude that "Much of the country's problems now...seem to be rooted in the fact that the country has had in its entire history no form of social revolution." The consequences of this failure include "the jinxed land reform programme," a failure that "profoundly affects the prognosis for the incidence of poverty" among the 67 percent of poor Filipino families living in rural areas, condemning them to permanent misery, huge foreign debt, "massive capital flight," an increase in severe malnutrition among pre-school children since the Aquino Government took power, widespread underemployment, and survival for many on incomes far below Government-defined poverty thresholds, "the growth of a virtual society of beggars and criminals," and the rest of the familiar story.  Government and academic experts expect things to get considerably worse. For the "rapidly expanding disadvantaged," the only way out is to seek work abroad: "legal and illegal workers from the Philippines now comprise the greatest annual labour exodus in Asia." With social programs abandoned, the only hope is if "the big-business elite, in a situation of little government interference, foregoes the Philippine elite traditional proclivity towards conspicuous consumption, and instead use profits both for their employees' welfare and to accumulate capital for industrial development."

<P>Their failure to do so can perhaps be explained by the fact that the United States has had so little time to exercise its tutelage; only 90 years, after all. That its ministrations might have something to do with what we find is a possibility not to be addressed.  In the real world, these desperate conditions can be traced in no small measure to the U.S. invasion at the turn of the century with its vast slaughter and destruction, the long colonial occupation, and the subsequent policies including the postwar counterinsurgency campaign and support for the Marcos dictatorship as long as it was viable. But the Philippines did gain the (intermittent) gift of democracy. In the same business journal, a columnist for the Manila Daily Globe, Conrado de Quiros, reflects on this matter under the heading "The wisdom of democracy." He compares the disaster of the Philippines to the economic success story of Singapore under Lee Kuan Yew, whose harsh tyranny is another of those famous triumphs of democracy and capitalism. De Quiros quotes the Singapore Minister of Trade and Industry, Lee's son, who condemns the U.S. model imposed on the Philippines for many flaws, the "worst crime" being that it granted the Filipinos a free press; in his own words, "An American-style free-wheeling press purveyed junk in the marketplace of ideas, which led to confusion and bewilderment, not to enlightenment and truth."  With a better appreciation of the merits of fascism, his Singapore government is too wise to fall into this error.

<P>The Americans did introduce a form of democracy, de Quiros continues.  However, it "was not designed to make Filipinos free but to make them comfortable with their new chains." It may have given the Filipinos more newspapers, but "it has given them less money with which to buy them. It has made the rich richer," with "one of the world's worst cases of inequity in the distribution of wealth," according to the World Bank. Democracy "was an instrument of colonisation," and was not intended to have substantive content: "For most Filipinos, American-style democracy meant little more than elections every few years. Beyond this, the colonial authorities made sure that only the candidates who represented colonial interests first and last won. This practice did not die with colonialism. The ensuing political order, which persisted long after independence, was one where a handful of families effectively and ruthlessly ruled a society riven by inequality. It was democratic in form, borrowing as many American practices as it could, but autocratic in practice.

<P>That these were indeed the policy goals is a rational conclusion in the light of historical practice and the documentary record. We may then describe the Philippines as another success story of democracy and capitalism, and number its people too among the victors in the Cold War.

<P>Under Philippine democracy, most of the population is not represented.  The politicians are lawyers or wealthy businessmen or landowners. As the political structure bequeathed to the Philippines by the American occupation was reconstituted after the overthrow of the U.S.-backed dictator by "people power," Gary Hawes writes in the scholarly journal Pacific Affairs, "it is only those with money and muscle who can be elected." Candidates are mainly "former elected officials, relatives of powerful political families and/or members of the economic elite," unrepresentative of the rural majority or even "the citizens who had demonstrated to bring down Marcos and who had risked their lives to protect their ballots for Corazon Aquino." There was a party (PnB) based on the popular organizations that arose against the dictatorship, with broad support from the peasantry, the labor force, and large reformist sections of the middle class, but it was to have no political role. In the elections, PnB was outspent by the traditional conservative parties by a ratio of up to 20 to 1. Its supporters were subjected to intimidation and threats of loss of jobs, housing, and city licenses. The military presence also served to inhibit PnB campaigning. Interviews with poor farmers and workers revealed a preference for PnB candidates, but a recognition that since the military and the rural elite opposed them, "the next best choice was to take the money or the rewards and vote for the candidates endorsed by the Aquino government.

<P>The playing field having been properly levelled, our celebrated "yearning for democracy" is satisfied.

<P>Under the reconstituted elite democracy, Hawes continues, "the voices of the rural dwellers" -- almost two-thirds of the population -- "have seldom been heard," and the same is true of the urban poor. The cure for agitation in the countryside is militarization and the rise of vigilantes, leading to a record of human rights violations "as bad as, if not worse than, during the time of Marcos," a 1988 human rights mission reported, with torture, summary executions, and forced evacuations. There is economic growth, but its fruits "have seldom trickled down to the most needy." Peasants continue to starve while paying 70 percent of their crop to the landlord. Agrarian reform is barely a joke. Support for the National Democratic Front (NDF) and its guerrillas is mounting after years of rural organizing.

<P>De Quiros suggests that there has been "substantive democracy in the Philippines -- despite colonialism and elite politics." "This is so because democracy took a life of its own, expressing itself in peasant revolts and popular demand for reforms." It is just this substantive democracy that the United States and its allies are dedicated to repress and contain. Hence the absence of any social revolution of the kind that he and several other commentators in this most respectable business journal see as sorely lacking in the Philippines -- though if it can join the club of "capitalist democracies" of the Singapore variety, the tune will likely change.

<P>Meanwhile, Survival International reports that tribal peoples are being attacked by the private army of a logging company, which, in a six month campaign of terror, has killed and tortured villagers, burned down houses, destroyed rice stores, and driven thousands from their homes. The same tribal people are among the many victims of bombing of villages and other practices of the government counterinsurgency campaigns. Appeals to the Aquino government have been ignored. An appeal to the U.S. government, or Western circles generally, cannot be seriously proposed. The same is true in Thailand, where the government announced a plan to expel six million people from forests where it wants to establish softwood plantations.

<P>Miracles of capitalism are also to be found elsewhere in Asia. Charles Gray, responsible for Asian affairs in the pro-business AFL-CIO foreign affairs branch (AIFLD), observes in the Far Eastern Economic Review that transnational corporations "generally insist the host government suppress the right of workers to organise and join unions, even when that right is guaranteed in the country's own constitution and laws." The organization that coordinates trade in the Free World (GATT) does not have a single rule that "covers the subsidies that transnational corporations get though pressures on Third World governments to permit 19th century-type exploitation of labour." In Malaysia, "U.S. and other foreign corporations forced the Labour Ministry in 1988 to continue the government's long-standing prohibition of unions in the electronics industry by threatening to shift their jobs and investments to another country." In Bangladesh, contractors for the transnationals "discriminate against women and girls by paying them starvation wages as low as 9 U.S. cents an hour." In China's Guangdong province, when the government found that "the factory of a leading toy manufacturer was engaged in labour law violations -- such as 14-hour workdays and 7-day workweeks -- it approached the managers to ask them to respect the law. The managers refused, and said that if they were unable to operate the way they wanted they would close their Chinese factories and move to Thailand," where there are no such unreasonable demands.

<P>Low prices for imported toys have doubtless brought much Christmas cheer in the industrial West.


<H3>The Fruits Of Victory: Africa</H3>

<P>The scene in Africa is worse still. To mention only one small element of a growing catastrophe, a study of the U.N. Economic Commission for Africa estimates that "South Africa's military aggression and destabilization of its neighbors cost the region $10 billion in 1988 and over $60 billion and <I>1.5 million lives in the first nine years of this decade.</I>" Such figures are considered too insignificant to merit notice in the Newspaper of Record, which avoided the matter. Congress imposed sanctions on South Africa in 1986 over Reagan's veto, but their impact has been limited. The American Committee on Africa reports that only 25 percent of U.S.-South African trade has been affected, and that iron, steel, and (until late 1989) half-finished uranium continued to be imported. After the sanctions were put in place, U.S. exports to South Africa increased from $1.28 billion in 1987 to $1.71 billion in 1989, according to the U.S. Commerce Department.

<P>While the South African government and the minority White groups it represents face mounting problems, they may see some rays of hope as well. New diplomatic ties between South Africa and Hungary, now that it has achieved independence, may prove to be "the wedge that breaks trade sanctions and the international isolation of the South African government," the Christian Science Monitor reports in a lead story, citing an economist at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences who foresees expanding trade between South Africa and Eastern Europe.

<P>The economic catastrophe of much of Africa is commonly attributed to "socialism," a term used freely to apply to anything we are not supposed to like. But there is an exception, "an island of freewheeling capitalism in a sea of one-party socialist states," Africa correspondent Howard Witt of the conservative Chicago Tribune writes. He is referring to Liberia, which, like the Philippines, can attribute its happy state to the fact that it was "America's only toehold on the African continent" -- for a century and a half, in this case. Liberia took on special significance during the Cold War years, Witt continues, particularly after President Samuel Doe, a "brutish, nearly illiterate army sergeant...seized power in 1980 after disemboweling the previous president in his bed" (more recently suffering a similar fate himself), and proceeded to elevate his fellow tribesmen -- 4 percent of the population -- into a new ruling elite, and to persecute and savagely oppress the rest of the population. The Reagan administration, much impressed, determined to turn Liberia, like Jamaica, into a showcase of capitalism and democracy. In the first six years of Doe's regime, the U.S. poured military and economic aid into "the backward country," "even as evidence mounted that Doe and his ministers were stealing much of the money, and after he "brazenly stole" the 1985 election with Washington's approval, in a replay of the Noriega story a year earlier. A "respected expatriate Liberian dissident and former government minister," Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, says: "At the time, an American official told me bluntly, `Our strategic interests are more important than democracy'."

<P>The results of the aid are evident, Witt writes: "The soldiers of President Samuel Doe's army wear the uniforms of American GIs as they go about their business murdering Liberian civilians on the streets of the capital, Monrovia," named after President Monroe, and "the bodies of many of the civilian victims are dumped in the morgue at the American-built John F. Kennedy Hospital," where "combat-hardened doctors" say "they have never witnessed such brutality." Monrovia is a death trap, Witt writes. Those who are not struck down by starvation, cholera, or typhoid try to escape the army or the rebel forces under Charles Taylor, a former Doe aide -- or later, those under the command of a breakaway unit led by Prince Johnson.

<P>The results of the U.S. aid became even clearer when reporters entered Monrovia with the African peacekeeping force after Doe was tortured and murdered by Johnson's guerrillas. They found "a bloody legacy" of the "10 years in power" of the U.S. favorite, UPI reporter Mark Huband writes: piles of bleached bones and skulls, many smashed; "half-clothed, decomposed heaps of flesh...littered with millions of maggots"; "contorted bodies...huddled beneath church pews" and "piled up in a dark corner beside the altar"; bodies "rotting into their mattresses"; "a large meeting hall for women and children [where] clothes clung to the skeletons of female and underaged victims."

<P>Not everyone, of course, has suffered in this "island of freewheeling capitalism." For a century and a half, the oligarchy of freed American slaves and their descendants "oppressed and exploited the indigenous population," while "the U.S. looked the other way." And lately, the Reagan favorites did quite well for themselves until their turn came to be dispatched. Others merely benefited, escaping any such unpleasant fate: "U.S. corporations like Firestone and B.F. Goodrich made healthy profits from the expansive Liberian operations," Witt observes, proving that freewheeling capitalism has its virtues. The U.S. built a huge Voice of America transmitter in Liberia, perhaps to broadcast the happy message of what can be achieved under capitalist democracy. We can chalk up another victory for the Free World.

<P>Current U.S. policy, Johnson-Sirleaf says, is "a lack of policy."  "It's kind of, `Oh, those Africans are at it again. Let them fight, and may the best man win'." To judge by the commentary on all of this, there is nothing here to teach us anything about ourselves, our legendary benevolence, or the marvels of freewheeling capitalism.

<P>Behind the "lack of policy," there is, however, the usual policy toward the Third World, which we can trace back as usual to the early postwar period when the global order was being shaped in the interests of the rich and powerful in the West. Like other parts of the Third World, Africa had its "function." It was to be "exploited" for the reconstruction of Europe, George Kennan explained in a major State Department study on the international order. He added that the opportunity to exploit Africa should provide a psychological lift for the European powers, affording them "that tangible objective for which everyone has been rather unsuccessfully groping...." History might have suggested a different project: that Africa should "exploit" Europe to enable it to reconstruct from centuries of devastation at the hands of European conquerors, perhaps also improving its psychological state through this process. Needless to say, nothing of the sort was remotely thinkable, and the actual proposals have received little notice, apparently being regarded as uncontroversial.

<P>In discussion of African policy particularly, the element of racism cannot be discounted. Dean Acheson warned the former Prime Minister of the racist government of Rhodesia in 1971 to beware of the "American public," who "decide that the only correct decision of any issue must be one which favors the colored point of view." He urged that Rhodesia not "get led down the garden path by any of our constitutional cliches -- equal protection of the laws, etc. -- which have caused us so much trouble...." This venerated figure of American liberalism was particularly disturbed by the Supreme Court's use of "vague constitutional provisions" which "hastened racial equality and has invaded the political field by the one-man-one-vote doctrine," which made "Negroes...impatient for still more rapid progress and led to the newly popular techniques of demonstration and violence" (September 1968). The "pall of racism...hovering over" African affairs under the Nixon administration, "and over the most basic public issues foreign and domestic," has been discussed by State Department official Roger Morris, including Nixon's request to Kissinger to assure that his first presidential message to Congress on foreign policy have "something in it for the jigs" (eliciting "the usual respectful `Yes'" from this abject flunkey); Kissinger's disbelief that the Ibos, "more gifted and accomplished" than other Nigerians, could also be "more Negroid"; and Alexander Haig's "quietly pretend[ing] to beat drums on the table as African affairs were brought up at NSC staff meetings.


<H3>The "Unrelenting Nightmare"</H3>

<P>The World Health Organization estimates that 11 million children die every year in the world of the Cold War victors ("the developing world") because of the unwillingness of the rich to help them. The catastrophe could be brought to a quick end, the WHO study concludes, because the diseases from which the children suffer and die are easily treated. Four million die from diarrhea; about two-thirds of them could be saved from the lethal dehydration it causes by sugar and salt tablets that cost a few pennies. Three million die each year from infectious diseases that could be overcome by vaccination, at a cost of about $10 a head. Reporting in the London Observer on this "virtually unnoticed" study, Annabel Ferriman quotes WHO director-general Hiroshi Nakajima, who observes that this "silent genocide" is "a preventable tragedy because the developed world has the resources and technology to end common diseases worldwide," but lacks "the will to help the developing countries."

<P>The basic story was summarized succinctly by President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda, chairman of the Organization of African Unity. Speaking at the UN conference of the world's 41 least-developed countries, he called the 1980s "an unrelenting nightmare" for the poorest countries.  There was a plea to the industrial powers to more than double their aid to a munificent 2/10 of 1 percent of their GNP, but no agreement was reached, the New York Times reports "principally because of opposition from the United States."

<P>As capitalism and freedom won their Grand Victory, the World Bank reported that the share of the world's wealth controlled by poor and medium-income countries declined from 23 percent to 18 percent (1980 to 1988). The Bank's 1990 report adds that in 1989, resources transferred from the "developing countries" to the industrialized world reached a new record. Debt service payments are estimated to have exceeded new flows of funds by $42.9 billion, an increase of $5 billion from 1988, and new funds from the wealthy fell to the lowest level in the decade.

<P>These are some of the joys of capitalism that are somehow missing in the flood of self-praise and the encomia to the wonders of our system -- of which all of this is a noteworthy component -- as we celebrate its triumph. The media and journals are inundated with laments (with an admixture of barely concealed glee) over the sad state of the Soviet Union and its domains, where even a salary of $100 a month enjoyed by the luckier workers is "scandalously high by the niggardly standards of Communism." One will have to search far, however, for a look at the scene nearer to home, or for derisive commentary on "the niggardly standards of capitalism" and the suffering endured by the huge mass of humanity who have been cast aside by the dominant powers, long the richest and most favored societies of the world, and not without a share of responsibility for the circumstances of most of the others, all too easy to ignore.

<P>The missing view also unveils a possible future that may await much of Eastern Europe, which has endured many horrors, but is still regarded with envy in large parts of the Third World domains of the West that had comparable levels of development in the past, and are no less well endowed with resources and the material conditions for satisfying human needs. "Why have the leaders, the media, the citizens of the Great Western Democracies cared long and ardently for the people of Central Europe, but cared nothing for the people of Central America?"  the experienced correspondent Martha Gellhorn asks: "Most of them are bone poor, and most of them do not have white skin. Their lives and their deaths have not touched the conscience of the world. I can testify that it was far better and safer to be a peasant in communist Poland than it is to be a peasant in capitalist El Salvador."

<P>Her question is, unfortunately, all too easy to answer. It has been demonstrated beyond any lingering doubt that what sears the sensitive soul is the crimes of the enemy, not our own, for reasons that are all too obvious and much too uncomfortable to face. The comparison that Gellhorn draws is scarcely to be found in Western commentary, let alone the reasons for it.

<P>As in Latin America, some sectors of Eastern European society should come to share the economic and cultural standards of privileged classes in the rich industrial world that they see across their borders, much of the former Communist Party bureaucracy probably among them. Many others might look to the second Brazil, and its counterparts elsewhere, for a glimpse of a different future, which may come to pass if matters proceed on their present course.

<H1>The Victors, Part III</H1>
<CITE>Z Magazine,</CITE> April 1991
</CENTER>


<P>In the first two segments of this series, I raised the question that at once comes to mind amidst the cheers for the glorious victory of the West in the Cold War: how are the victors faring at the moment of their triumph? A survey of the domains of the state capitalist industrial societies provides a stark answer: we find an "unrelenting nightmare," in the accurate words of those who have enjoyed the kind tutelage of the West. The catastrophe of capitalism could not be more vivid and dramatic.

<P>Notice that the question raised is precisely the right one. One will learn next to nothing from a comparison of Eastern and Western Europe. In contrast, it is quite reasonable to compare regions that were more or less similar in relevant respects 80 years ago, but have since followed a different course: subjugation to Leninist-Stalinist tyranny and its aftermath (the USSR and Eastern Europe), or domination by the state capitalist democracies (the conventional Third World).

<P>Neither of these regions is homogeneous, and their prior histories differ as well. But to a first approximation, it is reasonable to describe large parts of both regions, before World War I, as roughly comparable in social and economic development, and relation to the West. At the time, Russia was developing, though it was far more backward than Western Europe and not closing the gap, and by 1914, "becoming a semi-colonial possession of European capital," historian Teodor Shanin observes. Making a similar point, economic historian Alexander Gerschenkron notes that "in 1913, that is, thirty-five years after Bulgaria's liberation, nearly 80 percent of all the plows used in Bulgarian farming were most primitive wooden implements," and in the 1930s, "wooden plows were still more numerous than the iron ones." Similar observations hold generally, so it appears, though comparative studies seem to be few.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.1" HREF="#FN3.1">1</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>It is therefore of some interest to ask how Guatemalan peasants or Brazilian slum dwellers would react, were they to find themselves suddenly transported to Poland or Bulgaria or the Ukraine. We learn a good deal about ourselves by pursuing the inquiry, and also by observing how the obvious questions are stifled and eliminated in the chorus of self-adulation.


<H3>Some Unheard Voices</H3>

<P>The victims, of course, do not join the chorus, but as always, their voices remain unheard. Thus, there is much pretense of concern over the murder of the Jesuit intellectuals in El Salvador, but it does not reach as far as attending to anything they say on any topic, including this one, even though -- or rather because -- one might learn a good deal from the exercise. On the question at hand, the journal <CITE>Proceso</CITE> of the Jesuit University UCA in San Salvador, where the priests were assassinated, has this to say:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The so-called Salvadoran `democratic process' could learn a lot from the capacity for self-criticism that the socialist nations are demonstrating. If Lech Walesa had been doing his organizing work in El Salvador, he would have already entered into the ranks of the disappeared -- at the hands of `heavily armed men dressed in civilian clothes'; or have been blown to pieces in a dynamite attack on his union headquarters. If Alexander Dubcek were a politician in our country, he would have been assassinated like He'ctor Oquel!  [the social democratic leader assassinated in Guatemala, by Salvadoran death squads, according to the Guatemalan government]. If Andrei Sakharov had worked here in favor of human rights, he would have met the same fate as Herbert Anaya [one of the many murdered leaders of the independent Salvadoran Human Rights Commission CDHES]. If Ota-Sik or Vaclav Havel had been carrying out their intellectual work in El Salvador, they would have woken up one sinister morning, lying on the patio of a university campus with their heads destroyed by the bullets of an elite army battalion.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.2" HREF="#FN3.2">2</A></FONT></SUP>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The comparison between the Soviet and U.S. satellites is so dramatic that it takes real dedication not to perceive it, and outside of Western intellectual circles, it is a commonplace. A writer in the Mexico's leading daily comments on the "striking contrast" between Soviet behavior toward its satellites and "U.S.  policy in the Western Hemisphere, where intransigence, interventionism and the application of typical police state instruments have traditionally marked Washington's actions": "In Europe, the USSR and Gorbachev are associated with the struggle for freedom of travel, political rights, and respect for public opinion. In the Americas, the U.S. and Bush are associated with indiscriminate bombings of civilians, the organization, training and financing of death squads, and programs of mass murder" -- not quite the story in New York and Washington, where the United States is hailed as an "inspiration for the triumph of democracy in our time" (<CITE>New Republic</CITE>).<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.3" HREF="#FN3.3">3</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>A prominent Latin American theologian, Pablo Richard, also fails to see matters as he is informed he does by the <CITE>New Republic</CITE> commissars. Richard is professor of theology at the National University of Costa Rica and a leading figure in the formation of the base Christian communities, a prime target of the U.S.-backed savagery of the Reagan-Bush years (enthusiastically supported by the <CITE>New Republic</CITE> and others who now bask in their inspiring triumph) because they sought to organize the poor, threatening to bring democracy and social reform, the ultimate crime. Richard compares the current situation of the Third World to that of the early Christians under the Roman Empire, which Christians saw as "the Beast, a murderous idolatrous Beast," who could not be confronted with force, because it is far too powerful and violent, but must be confronted ethically and spiritually: "This new way of confronting imperialism in the decade of the `90s, which emphasizes cultural, ethical, spiritual, and theological confrontation, challenges in a special way the [Christian base communities] and the Church of the Poor," Richard writes.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.4" HREF="#FN3.4">4</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Others use different terms to express similar perceptions. The essential points, again, are a commonplace outside of disciplined Western circles, mired in ideological fanaticism and blind to the elementary (but unacceptable) realities of the world.


<H3>Latin America and the Soviet Bloc</H3>

<P>The social, economic, and ecological catastrophes resulting from traditional Western imperialism and its more recent variants go a long way towards explaining the reluctance of many in the Third World to join the celebration of victory, and their tendency to regard the victims of Soviet tyranny with a degree of envy. Furthermore, the state terror faced on a daily basis by Latin Americans who dare to raise their heads has been qualitatively different from the repression in Eastern Europe in the post-Stalin period, terrible as that was in its own ways; and they do not share our reluctance to see the powerful and systematic influence of Washington and U.S. corporations in establishing and maintaining the grim conditions of their lives.

<P>Another comparison that might be addressed is suggested by the huge flow of capital from the Third World to the United States and the West generally. Latin America alone transferred some $150 billion to the industrial West from 1982 to 1987 in addition to $100 billion of capital flight, a capital transfer amounting to 25 times the total value of the Alliance for Progress and 15 times the Marshall Plan, according to Latin Americanist Robert Pastor, director of Latin American and Caribbean Affairs for the National Security Council under the Carter administration. The Bank for International Settlements in Switzerland estimates that between 1978 and 1987, some $170 billion in flight capital left Latin America, not including money hidden by falsified trade transactions. The <CITE>New York Times</CITE> cites another estimate that anonymous capital flows, including drug money and flight capital, total $600 billion to $800 billion. This huge hemorrhage is part of a complicated system whereby Western banks and Latin American elites enrich themselves at the expense of the general population of Latin America, saddled with the "debt crisis" that results from these manipulations, and taxpayers in the Western countries who are ultimately called upon to foot part of the bill.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.5" HREF="#FN3.5">5</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Again, the situation in the Soviet satellites is different. One commentator on their affairs, Lawrence Weschler, observes that

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Poles, like most Eastern Europeans, have long lived under the delusion that the Soviets were simply bleeding them dry; in fact, the situation has been considerably more complex than that. (The Soviet dominion was in fact that unique historical perversity, an empire in which the center bled <I>itself</I> for the sake of its colonies, or rather, for the sake of tranquility in those colonies. Muscovites always lived poorer lives than Varsovians.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Throughout the region, journalists and others report, shops are better stocked than in the Soviet Union and material conditions are often better. It is widely agreed that "Eastern Europe has a higher standard of living than the USSR," and that while "Latin-Americans claim mainly economic exploitation," "Soviet exploitation of Eastern Europe is principally political and security-oriented" (Jan Triska, summarizing the conclusions of a Stanford University symposium on the USSR in Eastern Europe and the U.S. in Latin America).<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.6" HREF="#FN3.6">6</A></FONT></SUP> In the decade of the 1970s, according to U.S. government sources, the Soviet Union provided an $80 billion subsidy to its Eastern European satellites (while their indebtedness to the West increased from $9.3 billion in 1971 to $68.7 billion in 1979). A study done at the Institute of International Studies of the University of California (Berkeley) estimated the subsidy at $106 billion from 1974 to 1984. Using different criteria, another academic study by Paul Marer and Kazimierz Poznanski reaches the estimate of $40 billion for the same period, omitting factors that might add several billion, they note. When Lithuania was faced with Soviet economic retaliation after its declaration of independence, the <CITE>Wall Street Journal</CITE> reported that the Soviet subsidy to that country alone might approach $6 billion annually.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.7" HREF="#FN3.7">7</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Such comparisons cannot simply be taken at face value; complex issues arise, and they have never been properly addressed. The only extensive scholarly study attempting to compare the U.S. impact on Latin America with that of the USSR on Eastern Europe, to my knowledge, is the Stanford symposium just cited, but it does not reach very far. Among many striking gaps, the contributors entirely disregard repression and state terror in Latin America and the U.S. role in implementing it. Writing in May 1986, the editor states that "some left-wing forces in Latin America and all dissidents in Eastern Europe have little hope of bringing about substantive changes, either peacefully or through violence." One contributor even takes seriously (though rejecting) the absurd statement by Mexican writer (now Nobel Laureate) Octavio Paz in 1985 that it is "monstrous" even to raise the question of comparing U.S. policies with those of the Soviet Union. Most take it as obvious, hence needing no real evidence, that U.S. influence has been disinterested and benign. In fact, this 470 page study contains very little information altogether.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.8" HREF="#FN3.8">8</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Many questions would arise if such comparisons were to be undertaken in a meaningful way. Contrary to standard conventions (generally followed in the Stanford symposium), it is hardly plausible to regard U.S. security concerns in Latin America as comparable to those of the Soviet Union in Eastern Europe, or even to take seriously the conventional doctrine that security concerns are "probably the greatest factor in shaping U.S. policy toward Latin America" (Robert Wesson, presenting the "historical overview and analysis" for the Stanford symposium). In recent memory, the United States has not been repeatedly invaded and virtually destroyed by powerful enemies marching through Central America. In fact, its authentic security concerns are virtually nil, by international and historical standards. There are what are called "security concerns," but as one participant in the symposium finally concedes, after having taken them quite seriously, "U.S. national security interests in the Caribbean [as elsewhere in the hemisphere, we may add] have rested on powerful economic investments" (Jiri Valenta) -- which is to say that they are termed "security interests" only for purposes of the delusional system. Furthermore, it makes little sense to attribute to the United States greater tolerance for "political-ideological deviations" on the grounds that it does not insist on "the U.S. brand of democracy" and tolerates "authoritarian dictatorships," while the USSR insists on Leninist regimes (Valenta). What the U.S. demands is an economic order geared to its interests; the political form it takes is largely an irrelevance.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.9" HREF="#FN3.9">9</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Unless freed from the extreme ideological constraints of conventional scholarship, comparative study is bound to be largely worthless.

<P>The matter of capital flow is also complex. In the first place, the regional hegemons are not remotely comparable in wealth and economic level, and never have been, so that their role in economic transactions will differ greatly. For another, investment has intricate effects. It can lead to economic growth, benefit certain sectors of the population while severely harming others, lay the basis for independent development or undermine such prospects. The numbers in themselves tell only a small part of the story, and have to be complemented by the kind of analysis that has yet to be undertaken in comparing Eastern Europe and Latin America.

<P>It should be evident without further comment that the standard comparison of Eastern to Western Europe, or the Soviet Union to the United States, is virtually meaningless, designed for propaganda, not enlightenment.


<H3>Latin America and the NICs</H3>

<P>Other subordinate and dependent systems have yet a different character. Discussing the rapid economic growth of South Korea and Taiwan after the powerful stimulus given by Vietnam war spending, Bruce Cumings observes that it resumes a process of development begun under Japanese colonialism. Unlike the West, he notes, Japan brought industry to the labor and raw materials rather than vice versa, leading to industrial development under state-corporate guidance, now renewed. Japan's colonial policies were extremely brutal, but they laid a basis for economic development. Needless to say, these economic successes, like those of Singapore and Hong Kong, are no tribute either to democracy or the wonders of the market; rather, to harsh labor conditions, efficient quasi-fascist political systems, and, much as in Japan, high levels of protectionism and planning by financial-industrial conglomerates in a state-coordinated economy.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.10" HREF="#FN3.10">10</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Comparison of the Pacific colonies of the U.S. and Japan is not common here, but right-wing Japanese are not reluctant to pursue it. Shintaro Ishihara, a powerful figure in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, which holds a virtual monopoly of political power, observes that the countries that were once under Japanese administration are "success stories" from the economic point of view, while the Philippines are an economic disaster and the "showcase of democracy" is largely empty form. "Philippine landowners have accumulated incredible power and wealth, siphoning everything from the ordinary people," while "tradition is dismantled" in favor of a shallow and superficial veneer of American culture, "an atrocity -- a barbaric act."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.11" HREF="#FN3.11">11</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>This spokesman for right-wing nationalism is plainly not a trustworthy independent source. But there is more than a little truth to what he says.

<P>Comparison of the Latin American economies with those of East Asia (the "Newly Industrializing Countries," NICs) is another topic that has rarely been undertaken seriously. Editorials, news reporting, and other commentary commonly allege that the comparison reveals the superiority of economic liberalism, but without providing the basis for that conclusion. It is not easy to sustain, if only because of the radical departures from liberal capitalism in the success stories of Asia. As Alice Amsden in particular has emphasized, the highly touted economic successes of East Asia can be traced in no small measure to the fact that the state is not only powerful enough to discipline labor, as is the norm, but even to discipline <I>capital,</I> and to compel sharp departures from market principles for the sake of economic development. More generally, it is virtually the conventional wisdom (and well supported) that "late developing countries" typically rely on extensive state intervention and coordination. In fact, it is hard to find any exception, late or early. If the U.S. had kept to the principles it now imposes on the "developing world," we would probably still be pursuing our comparative advantage in producing furs, and it is hardly likely that we would ever have had, say, a steel industry. The same continues to be true of advanced industrial societies, including the United States, where the parts of the economy that remain competitive benefit from huge taxpayer subsidies and a state-guaranteed market (high tech industry via the Pentagon system being the most striking case). In Germany, to mention only one feature, the IMF estimates that industrial incentives are the equivalent of a 30 percent tariff. IMF conditions and the like are fine for weaker economies that we intend to exploit.  The conditions greatly facilitate the robbery of the poor.  Beyond that, their merits are less than obvious.

<P>The comparison between Latin America and East Asia was addressed at a conference on global macroeconomics in Helsinki in 1986.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.12" HREF="#FN3.12">12</A></FONT></SUP> Several contributors observe that the situation is complex, and conclude that the disparities that developed in the 1980s (though not before) are attributable to a variety of factors, among them, the harmful effects of greater openness to international capital markets in large parts of Latin America (as in the Philippines), which permitted vast capital flight, but not in the East Asian economies with their more rigid controls by government and central banks. In South Korea, for example, export of capital can carry the death penalty. Again, the standard story seems to be virtually the opposite of the truth.


<H3>Comparisons and their Pitfalls</H3>

<P>The complexity of the issues that arise is shown in a revealing study of Indian development, in comparison to China and others, by Harvard economist Amartya Sen. He observes that "a comparative study of the experiences of different countries in the world shows quite clearly that countries tend to reap as they sow in the field of investment in health and quality of life." India followed very different policies from China in this regard. Beginning at a comparable level in the late 1940s, India has added about 15 years to added life expectancy, while China added 10 or 15 years beyond that increase, approaching the standards of Europe. The reasons lie in social policy, primarily, the much greater focus on improving nutrition and health conditions for the general population in China, and providing widespread medical coverage. The same was true, Sen argues, in Sri Lanka and probably Vietnam, and in earlier years in Europe as well, where, for example, life expectancy rose rapidly in England and Wales after large-scale public intervention in the distribution of food and health care and expansion of public employment.

<P>But this is not the whole story. In the late 1950s, life expectancy in China plunged for several years to far below that of India because of a huge famine, which took an estimated 30 million lives. Sen attributes the famine to the nature of the Chinese regime, which did not react for three years, and may not even have been aware of the scale of the famine because the totalitarian conditions blocked information flow. Nothing similar has happened in India with its pluralist democracy. Nevertheless, Sen calculates, if China's lower mortality rates prevailed in India, there would have been close to 4 million fewer deaths a year in the mid-1980s. "This indicates that every eight years or so more people in addition die in India -- in comparison with Chinese mortality rates -- than the total number that died in the gigantic Chinese famine," the worst in the world in this century.

<P>In further confirmation of his thesis, Sen observes that life expectancy in China has suffered a slow decline since 1979, when the new market-oriented reforms were undertaken. Another relevant example is the Indian state of Kerala, long under leftist rule and with "a long history of extensive public support in education, health care, and food distribution." Here, improvement in life expectancy is comparable to China, though it is one of India's poorer states.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.13" HREF="#FN3.13">13</A></FONT></SUP>


<H3>Human Values</H3>

<P>These are all serious and difficult questions, with far-reaching human consequences. The development strategies imposed upon the Third World by Western power, implemented by the international economic institutions or the states and corporations themselves, have enormous effects on the lives of the targeted populations. The record shows plainly enough that the policies that are advocated or enforced by the Western powers, and the confident rhetoric that accompanies them in official pronouncements and other commentary, are guided by the self-interest of those who hold the reins, not by any solid understanding of the economics of development, or any serious concern for the human impact of these decisions. Benefits that may accrue to others are largely incidental, as are the catastrophes that commonly ensue.

<P>As the collapsing Soviet system resumes traditional quasi-colonial relations with the West, it is coming to be subjected to the same prescriptions -- in part by choice, given the intellectual vacuity that is one of the consequences of decades of totalitarian rule. But imposition of Third World norms is bound to meet resistance. One Polish critic writes that if the popular Chicago School

<BLOCKQUOTE>
words become flesh, this government would be the first in the history of the world to adhere firmly to this doctrine. All developed countries, including those (such as the Federal Republic of Germany) whose governments pay obeisance to the liberal doctrine, apply a wide spectrum of government interventions, such as in resource allocation, in investments, in developing technology, income distribution, pricing, export and import.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.14" HREF="#FN3.14">14</A></FONT></SUP>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>If resistance follows the path often taken in the Third World, it is likely to elicit the classic response.

<P>On a visit to Europe a few days before he was assassinated by elite government forces in San Salvador in November 1989, Father Ignacio Ellacuria, rector of the University of Central America, addressed the West on the underlying issues. You "have organized your lives around inhuman values," he said. These values

<BLOCKQUOTE>
are inhuman because they cannot be universalized. The system rests on a few using the majority of the resources, while the majority can't even cover their basic necessities. It is crucial to define a system of values and a norm of living that takes into account every human being.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.15" HREF="#FN3.15">15</A></FONT></SUP>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>In our dependencies, such thoughts are subversive and can call forth the death squads. At home, they are sometimes piously voiced, then relegated to the ashcan in practice. Perhaps the last words of the murdered priests deserve a better fate.

</CENTER>


<P>At any historical moment, we are likely to find a conventional interpretation of the state of the world and our role within it, often gaining the force of unchallenged doctrine. Another near truism is that reality tends to depart from established Truth. The present period is no exception.

<P>That significant, even momentous, changes are underway in the world is clear enough, and has been so for many years. The conventional interpretation need not be elaborated at length; open an arbitrary journal, and it is laid out before you. The U.S. has won the Cold War. Righteousness has triumphed over evil with the victory of democracy, free market capitalism, justice and human rights. As standard bearer of the cause, the United States now leads the way to a New World Order of peace, economic development, and cooperation among those who have seen the light, virtually everyone except for some holdouts like Cuba which still complains irrationally that the Third World isn't getting its due -- or Saddam Hussein, despite our dedicated efforts to improve his behavior by the carrot rather than the stick, an error of judgment soon to be rectified by the sword of the righteous avenger.

<P>There are various ways to assess the validity of this inspiring picture. One is to have a look at the traditional domains of the U.S. (and the West generally), and ask how their people fare at this historic moment, as they celebrate the victory of their side, a triumph of liberal capitalism and democracy so final and conclusive, some feel, that we have reached "the end of history," after which we sink into a sad state of boredom, relieved only by the occasional technical manipulations needed to deal with questions at the margin.

<P>The concern that the fun might be over is not quite as novel as Francis Fukuyama and other devotees of the Hegelian Spirit suggest. At his first meeting with John F. Kennedy in 1958, Walt Rostow, later to become a top adviser of the Kennedy administration, warned -- perhaps a shade prematurely -- that after the astonishing domestic successes achieved by "the nation's creativeness and idealism over the past ninety years, ...we run the danger of becoming a bore to ourselves and the world." In Rostow's picture of the world (shared with Kennedy, according to his account), the basic problems of American society were then approaching full resolution. No real barriers stood in the way of economic progress without serious cyclic disorders, "social equity" for minorities, "the provision of equal educational opportunity," and "the equitable distribution of income." We knew what was needed, and agreed that it should be done. The consensus was so broad and the conclusions so well-founded as to signal "the end of ideology," it was widely held. Like Kennedy, Rostow felt that with the problems of domestic society largely behind us, "the great revolutionary transformations going forward in the underdeveloped world" should now absorb our energies and revitalize "those basic spiritual qualities which have been historically linked to the nation's sense of world mission."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.1" HREF="#FN1.1">1</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The Third World was soon to experience, once again, these "basic spiritual qualities," now with the special cast given them by the knights-errant of Camelot.

<P>Not everyone feels confident that the nature and proper goals of human society are fully understood, and the problems at home so close to resolution that only some minor tinkering remains, just as not all share Tom Wolfe's appreciation of the past decade as "one of the great golden moments that humanity has ever experienced." One need hardly go as far as a Black teenager in Harlem to find a slightly different sense of current realities. And even the most cursory look beyond the borders will locate voices that are not raised in joy and acclaim for the triumph of their champions -- Central American human rights workers and priests, for example -- and do not join the meaningless game of comparing Eastern and Western Europe, or the USSR and the United States, but rather choose, more realistically and more honestly, to compare the current state of regions that were at similar levels of economic and sociopolitical development, with similar endowments and prospects, not many years ago. And despite much curious rhetoric in media and other circles, some perceive that the past years hardly illustrate the thesis that democracy and the free market are the decisive conditions for economic success -- in Japan and the Four Tigers in its periphery, to take the obvious (but not only) example.

<P>Let us survey -- all too briefly -- some of the daily experience of those who should be savoring the fruits of victory. The reasonable course is to begin the inquiry close to home, in the domains where U.S. influence has been so overwhelming that the contours of the triumph must be shatteringly clear. In this first section, I will keep to that, turning in subsequent articles to a broader view, and to some comments on meaningful comparisons that would be made, and studies that would be pursued, if human concerns animated the odes to our virtue that accompany the triumph. I would also like to consider the shape of the New World Order and the U.S. role within it as seen from a perspective that departs from reigning conventions, attending to features of the contemporary world that suggest a rather different conception of where we are and where we are heading.


<H3>The Fruits of Victory</H3>

<P>Few regions of the world have been so dominated by a great power as Central America, which emerged from its usual oblivion in the 1980s, moving to center stage as the traditional order faced an unexpected challenge with the growth of popular movements, inspired in part by the new orientation of the Church toward "a preferential option for the poor" (Puebla Conference of Bishops, 1979). After decades of brutal repression and the destructive impact of the U.S. aid programs of the 1960s -- an "economic miracle" by statistical measures, a disaster for most of the population -- the ground was prepared for meaningful democracy and social change. The mood in Washington darkened further with the overthrow of the Somoza dictatorship and the defeat of his murderous National Guard despite the best efforts of the Carter administration, until the end, to ensure that it would retain effective power.

<P>The reaction was vigorous and swift: violent repression, which decimated popular organizations. The ranks of the small guerrilla organizations swelled as state terror mounted. "The guerrilla groups, the revolutionary groups, almost without exception began as associations of teachers, associations of labor unions, campesino unions, or parish organizations...." with practical and reformist goals, ex-Ambassador Robert White testified before Congress in 1982. The same point has been made by the assassinated Salvadoran Jesuit intellectual Father Ignacio Martin-Baro, among many others.

<P>A decade later, the United States and its local allies could claim substantial success. The challenge to the traditional order was effectively contained. The misery of the vast majority had deepened while the power of the military and the privileged sectors was enhanced behind a facade of democratic forms. Some 200,000 people had been killed, most of them slaughtered outright in a paroxysm of sadistic terror conducted by the forces armed, trained, and advised by the United States. Countless others were maimed, tortured, "disappeared," driven from their homes. The people, the communities, the environment were devastated, possibly beyond repair. It is truly a grand victory.

<P>Elite reaction in the United States is one of gratification and relief. "For the first time, all five of the countries are led by presidents who were elected in contests widely considered free and fair," <CITE>Washington Post</CITE> Central America correspondent Lee Hockstader reports from Guatemala City, expressing the general satisfaction over the victory of "conservative politicians" in elections which, we are to understand, took place on a level playing field with no use of force and no foreign influence. It is true, he continues, that "conservative politicians in Central America traditionally represented the established order," defending the wealthy "despite their countries' grossly distorted income patterns." "But the wave of democracy that has swept the region in recent years appears to be shifting politicians' priorities," so the bad old days are gone forever.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.2" HREF="#FN1.2">2</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The student of American history and culture will recognize the familiar moves. Once again, we witness the miraculous change of course that occurs whenever some particularly brutal excesses of the state have been exposed. Hence all of history, and the reasons for its persistent character, may be dismissed as irrelevant, while we march forward, leading our flock to a new and better world.

<P>The <CITE>Post</CITE> news report does not merely assert that the new conservatives are dedicated populists, unlike those whom the U.S. used to support in the days of its naivete and inadvertent error, now thankfully behind us. Serious journalistic standards require evidence for this central claim, and it is indeed provided. The shift of priorities to a welcome populism is demonstrated by the outcome of the conference of the five presidents in Antigua, Guatemala, just completed. The presidents, all "committed to free-market economics," have abandoned worthless goals of social reform, Hockstader explains. "Neither in the plan nor in the Declaration of Antigua' was there any mention of land reform or suggestion of new government social welfare programs to help the poor." Rather, they are adopting "a trickle-down approach to aid the poor." "The idea is to help the poor without threatening the basic power structure," a regional economist observes, contemplating these imaginative new ideas on how to pursue our vocation of serving the suffering masses.

<P>The headline reads "Central Americans to use Trickle-down Strategy in War on Poverty." Quite properly, the headline captures the basic thrust of the news story and the assumption that frames it: aiding the poor is the highest priority of this new breed of populist conservatives, as it always has been for Washington and the political culture generally. The only question is how to achieve this noble aim. That this has always been our fervent commitment is a doctrine so obviously valid that it need not be supported with any evidence or argument, or even formulated explicitly. It is merely presupposed, and we go on from there. What is newsworthy, and so promising, is the populism of the conservatives we support, and their ingenious and startlingly innovative approach to our traditional commitment to help the poor and suffering: a trickle-down strategy of enriching the wealthy -- a "preferential option for the rich," overcoming the errors of the Puebla Conference of Bishops.

<P>One participant in the meeting is quoted as saying that "These past 10 years have been gruesome for poor people, they've taken a beating." Putting aside the conventions, one might observe that the political outcomes hailed as a triumph of democracy are in no small measure a tribute to the efficacy of U.S. terror, and that the presidents who hold formal power, and their sponsors, might have had something other than a war on poverty in mind. There is also a history of trickle-down approaches to relieving poverty that might be explored. Such an inquiry might lead us to expect that the next 10 years will be no less gruesome for the poor. But that path is not pursued, here or elsewhere in the mainstream.

<P>The <CITE>Post</CITE> story captures well the character and dimensions of the U.S. victory. The satisfaction among the important people is readily understandable.

<P>While the three-day conference of populist conservatives was taking place in Antigua, 33 tortured, bullet-riddled bodies were discovered in Guatemala. They did not disturb the celebration over the triumph of freedom and democracy, or even make the news.

<P>Nor did the rest of the 125 bodies, half with signs of torture, found throughout the country that month, according to the Guatemalan Human Rights Commission. The Commission identified 79 as victims of "extrajudicial execution" by the security forces. Another 29 were kidnapped and 49 injured in kidnap attempts. The report comes to us from Mexico, where the Commission is based so that human rights workers can survive now that the U.S. has succeeded in establishing democracy in Guatemala.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.3" HREF="#FN1.3">3</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>In the Costa Rican journal <CITE>Mesoamerica,</CITE> a report on the Antigua meeting observes that "Now that the Sandinistas have been successfully booted out of office, the pervading attitude among regional and U.S. leaders with respect to the Esquipulas peace mission accomplished'." The core sections of the Central America accords that call for social justice and respect for human rights had been long been consigned to the ashcan, as intended by Oscar Arias and his U.S. sponsors in high places, who, along with the elite political culture generally, revealed by their actions their actual attitudes towards the savage atrocities conducted under the aegis of those with the right priorities.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.4" HREF="#FN1.4">4</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The U.N. Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (CEPAL) reports that the percentage of the Guatemalan population living in extreme poverty increased rapidly after the establishment of democracy in 1985, from 45% in that year to 76% in 1988. A study by the Nutritional Institute of Central America and Panama (INCAP) estimates that half the population live under conditions of extreme poverty, and that in rural areas, where the situation is worse, 13 out of every 100 children under five die of illnesses related to malnutrition. Other studies estimate that 20,000 Guatemalans die of hunger every year, that more than 1000 children died of measles alone in the first four months of 1990, and that "the majority of Guatemala's four million children receive no protection at all, not even for the most elemental rights." The Communique of the January 1990 Conference of Guatemalan Bishops reviews the steady deterioration of the critical situation of the mass of the population as "the economic crisis has degenerated into a social crisis" and human rights, even "the right to dignity," "do not exist."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.5" HREF="#FN1.5">5</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Throughout the region, the desperate situation of the poor majority has become still more grave with the progress of democracy, American-style. Three weeks before the Antigua conference, in his homily marking the completion of President Alfredo Cristiani's first year in office, Archbishop Rivera y Damas of San Salvador deplored the policies of his administration, which have worsened the already desperate plight of the poor; the conservative populist so admired in Washington and New York "is working to maintain the system," the Archbishop said, "favoring a market economy which is making the poor yet poorer."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.6" HREF="#FN1.6">6</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>In the neighboring countries, the situation is much the same. A few days after the encouraging <CITE>Washington Post</CITE> report on the Antigua meeting, an editorial in a leading Honduran journal appeared under the headline "Misery is increasing in Honduras because of the economic adjustment," referring to the new trickle-down strategy that the <CITE>Post</CITE> found so promising --  actually the traditional strategy, its lethal features now more firmly entrenched. The main victims are "the usual neglected groups: children, women, and the aged," according to the conclusions of an academic seminar on "Social Policy in the Context of Crisis," confirmed by "the Catholic Church, the unions, several political parties, and noted economists and statisticians of the country." Two-thirds of the population live below the poverty line, over half of these below the level of "dire need." Unemployment, undernourishment, and severe malnutrition are increasing.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.7" HREF="#FN1.7">7</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The Pan American Health Organization estimates that of 850,000 children born every year in Central America, 100,000 will die before the age of five and two-thirds of those who survive will suffer from malnutrition, with attendant physical or mental development problems. The Inter-American Development Bank reports that per capita income has fallen to the level of 1971 in Guatemala, 1961 in El Salvador, 1973 in Honduras, 1960 in Nicaragua, 1974 in Costa Rica, and 1982 in Panama.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.8" HREF="#FN1.8">8</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Nicaragua was an exception to this trend of increasing misery, but the U.S. terrorist attack and economic warfare succeeded in reversing earlier gains. Nevertheless, infant mortality halved over the decade, from 128 to 62 deaths per thousand births; "Such a reduction is exceptional on the international level," a UNICEF official said in 1989, "especially when the country's war-ravaged economy is taken into account."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.9" HREF="#FN1.9">9</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Studies by CEPAL, the World Health Organization, and others "cast dramatic light on the situation," Mexico's leading daily reports.

<P>They reveal that 15 million Central Americans, almost 60% of the population, live in poverty, of whom 9.7 million live in "extreme poverty." Severe malnutrition is rampant among children. 75% of the peasants in Guatemala, 60% in El Salvador, 40% in Nicaragua, and 35% in Honduras lack health care. To make matters worse, Washington has applied "stunning quotas on sugar, beef, cocoa, cheese, textiles, and limestone, as well as compensation laws and antidumping' policies in cement, flowers, and operations of cellulose and glass." The EEC and Japan have followed suit, also imposing harmful protectionist measures.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.10" HREF="#FN1.10">10</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The environment has shared the fate of those who people it. Deforestation, soil erosion, pesticide poisoning, and other forms of environmental destruction, increasing through the 1980s, are traceable in large measure to the development model imposed upon the region and U.S. militarization of it in recent years. Intense exploitation of resources by agribusiness and export-oriented production have enriched wealthy sectors and their foreign sponsors, and led to statistical growth, with a devastating impact on the land and the people. In El Salvador, large areas have become virtual wastelands as the military has sought to undermine the peasant base of the guerrillas by extensive bombardment, and by forest and crop destruction. There have been occasional efforts to stem the ongoing catastrophe. Like the Arbenz government overthrown in the CIA-run coup that restored the military regime in Guatemala, the Sandinistas initiated a series of environmental reforms and protections. These were desperately needed, both in the countryside and near Managua, where industrial plants had been permitted to dump waste freely. The most notorious case was the U.S. Penwalt corporation, which poured mercury into Lake Managua until 1981.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.11" HREF="#FN1.11">11</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>As in Guatemala 30 years before, these efforts to depart from what the <CITE>Washington Post</CITE> approvingly calls "the Central American mode" were satisfactorily overcome by U.S. terror and economic warfare.

<P>The foreign-imposed development model has emphasized "nontraditional exports" in recent years. Under the free market conditions approved for defenseless Third World countries, the search for survival and gain will naturally lead to products that maximize profit, whatever the consequences. Coca production has soared in the Andes and elsewhere for this reason, but there are other examples as well. After the discovery of clandestine "human farms" and "fattening houses" for children in Honduras and Guatemala, Dr. Luis Genaro Morales, president of the Guatemalan Pediatric Association, said that child trafficking "is becoming one of the principal nontraditional export products," generating $20 million of business a year. The International Human Rights Federation (IHRF), after an inquiry in Guatemala, gave a more conservative estimate, reporting that about 300 children are kidnapped every year, taken to secret nurseries, then sold for adoption at about $10,000 per child.

<P>The IHRF investigators could not confirm reports that organs of babies were being sold to foreign buyers. This macabre belief is widely held in the region, however. A few weeks earlier, the Honduran journal <CITE>Tiempo</CITE> reported that the Paraguayan police rescued 7 Brazilian babies from a gang that "intended to sacrifice them to organ banks in the United States, according to a charge in the courts." The same journal reported shortly after that an Appeals Judge in Honduras ordered "a meticulous investigation into the sale of Honduran children for the purpose of using their organs for transplant operations." A year earlier, the Secretary General of the National Council of Social Services, which is in charge of adoptions, had reported that Honduran children "were being sold to the body traffic industry" for organ transplant. "Fattening houses" for children had been found in San Pedro Sula and elsewhere.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.12" HREF="#FN1.12">12</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>A Resolution on the Trafficking of Central American Children, approved by the European Parliament two months later (November 1988), alleged that near a "human farm" in San Pedro Sula, infant corpses were found that "had been stripped of one or a number of organs." At another "human farm" in Guatemala, babies ranging from 11 days old to four months old had been found. The director of the farm, at the time of his arrest, declared that the children "were sold to American or Israeli families whose children needed organ transplants at the cost of $75,000 per child," the Resolution continues, expressing "its horror in the light of the facts" and calling for investigation and preventive measures.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.13" HREF="#FN1.13">13</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>As the region sinks into further misery, these reports continue to appear. In July 1990, a right-wing Honduran daily, under the headline "Loathsome Sale of Human Flesh," reported that police in El Salvador had discovered a group, headed by a lawyer, that was buying children to resell in the United States. An estimated 20,000 children disappear every year in Mexico, the report continues, destined for this end or for use in criminal activities such as transport of drugs "inside their bodies." "The most gory fact, however, is that many little ones are used for transplant [of organs] to children in the U.S.," which may account for the fact that the highest rate of kidnapping of children from infants to 18-year-olds is in the Mexican regions bordering on the United States.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.14" HREF="#FN1.14">14</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The one exception to the Central America horror story has been Costa Rica, set firmly on a course of state-guided development by the Jose Figueres coup of 1948, with welfare measures combined with harsh repression of labor, and virtual elimination of the armed forces. The U.S. has always kept a wary eye on this deviation from the regional standards, despite the welcome suppression of labor and the favorable conditions for foreign investors. In the 1980s, U.S. pressures to dismantle the social democratic features and restore the army elicited bitter complaints from Figueres and others who shared his commitments. While Costa Rica continues to stand apart from the region in political and economic development, the signs of what the Central Americanization' of Costa Rica" are unmistakeable.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.15" HREF="#FN1.15">15</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Under the pressure of a huge debt, Costa Rica has been compelled to follow "the preferential option for the rich": the IMF model of free market capitalism designed for the Third World, with austerity for the poor, cutback in social programs, and benefits for domestic and foreign investors. The results are coming in. By statistical measures, the economy is relatively strong. But more than 25% of the population -- 715,000 people -- live in poverty, 100,000 in extreme poverty, according to a study published by the ultra-right journal <CITE>La Nacion</CITE> (one feature of Costa Rican democracy being a monopoly of the Spanish language media by the extreme right sectors of the business community). A study by the Gallup office in Costa Rica published in <CITE>Prensa Libre</CITE> gives even higher figures, concluding that "approximately one million people cannot afford a minimum diet, nor pay for clothing, education or health care."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.16" HREF="#FN1.16">16</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The neoliberal economic policies of the 1980s increased social discontent and labor tensions, <CITE>Excelsior</CITE> reports, evoking an "intense attack by unionists, popular organizations," and others against the Arias administration, which has implemented these measures in conformity with U.S. demands and the priorities of privileged sectors. Church sources report that "the belt-tightening measures of the 1980s, which included the elimination of subsidies, low interest credit, price supports and government assistance programs, have driven many campesinos and small farmers off their land," leading to many protests. The Bishop of Limon issued a pastoral letter deploring the social deterioration and "worsening of the problems" to which "banana workers, in great majority immigrants from rural settings where they were property owners, have been subject." He also deplored the harsh labor code and government policies that enabled the growers to purge union leaders and otherwise undermine workers' rights, and the deforestation and pollution the companies have caused, with government support.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.17" HREF="#FN1.17">17</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Environmental degradation is serious here as well, including rapid deforestation and sedimentation that has severely effected virtually every major hydroelectric project. Environmental studies reveal that 42% of Costa Rica's soil shows signs of severe erosion. "Top soil is Costa Rica's largest export," the Vice-Minister of Natural Resources commented. Expanding production for export and logging have destroyed forests, particularly the cattle boom of the 1960s and 1970s promoted by the government, international banks and corporations, and the U.S. aid program, which also undermined food production for domestic needs, as elsewhere in Central America. Environmentalists blame government and business for "ecological illiteracy" -- more accurately, pursuit of profit without regard for externalities, as prescribed in the capitalist model.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.18" HREF="#FN1.18">18</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Submissiveness to these demands has yet to meet the exacting standards of the international guardians of business rights. The IMF suspended assistance to Costa Rica in February 1990, cancelling credits. U.S. aid is also falling, now that there is no longer any need to buy Costa Rica's cooperation in the anti-Sandinista jihad.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.19" HREF="#FN1.19">19</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Economic constraints and foreign pressures have narrowed the political system in the approved manner. In the 1990 elections, the two candidates had virtually identical (pro-business) programs, in accord with "Central American mode" approved by U.S.  liberal doctrine, and were highly supportive of U.S. policies in the region ("right on the mark," the eventual victor, Rafael Angel Calderon, declared in a debate sponsored by the business federation). The Central Americanization of Costa Rica is also revealed by the increasing repression through the 1980s. From 1985, the Costa Rican Human Rights Commission (CODEHU) reported torture, arbitrary arrest, harassment of campesinos and workers, and other abuses by the security forces, including a dramatic rise in illegal detentions and arrests. It links the growing wave of abuses to the increasing militarization of the police and security forces, some of whom have been trained in U.S. and Taiwanese military schools. These charges were supported further when an underground torture chamber was found in the building of the Costa Rican Special Police (OIJ), where prisoners were beaten and subjected to electric shock treatment, including torture of a pregnant woman who aborted and electric shock administered to a 13-year-old child to elicit a false confession. CODEHU alleges that 13 people have died in similar incidents since 1988.  "Battered by charges of corruption and drug trafficking, the Arias administration receives another blow to its diminishing reputation as a bulwark of democracy" from these revelations, the <CITE>Central America Report</CITE> observed.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.20" HREF="#FN1.20">20</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Arias's image "is about to be tarnished" further, according to reports from San Jose that investigators of the Legislative Drug Commission discovered that he had received a check for $50,000 for his campaign fund from Ocean Hunter Seafood, but had put it in his personal bank account. This Miami-based company and its Costa Rican affiliate, Frigarificos de Puntarenas, were identified by U.S. Congressional investigators as a drug trafficking operation.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.21" HREF="#FN1.21">21</A></FONT></SUP> I leave it to the reader to imagine Mark Uhlig's sardonic story in the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> if something similar were hinted about a minor Sandinista official, however flimsy the evidence.

<P>According to official government figures, the security budget increased 15% in 1988 and 13% in 1989 (spending on education rose less than half that much). The press has reported training of security officers in Fort Benning, Georgia, and U.S. bases in Panama, and a Taiwanese military academy, as well as by Israeli secret police, the army of El Salvador, the Guatemalan army special forces, and others. Fifteen private paramilitary, vigilante, and security organizations have been identified, with extreme nationalist and right-wing agendas. A member of the special commission of the legislature set up to investigate these matters described the police as an "army in disguise...out of control." The executive secretary of Costa Rica's Human Rights Commission, Sylvia Porras, noted that "the psychological profile of the police has changed as a result of military training," adding that "we cannot talk any longer of a civilian police force. What we have now is a hidden army."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.22" HREF="#FN1.22">22</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Annual U.S. military aid in the 1980s shot up to about 18 times what it had been from 1946 through 1979. U.S. pressures to rebuild the security forces, reversing the Figueres reforms, have been widely regarded as a factor in the drift towards the Central American mode. The role of Oscar Arias has evoked particular ridicule South of the border. After an Arias article in the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> piously calling on Panama to follow the Costa Rican model and abolish the army, the well-known Mexican writer Gregorio Selser published a review of some Costa Rican realities, beginning with the violent repression of a peaceful demonstration of landless campesinos in September 1986 by Arias's Civil Guard, with many serious injuries. The absence of an army in Costa Rica, he alleges, has become largely a matter of semantics; different words for the same things. He cites an Arias decree of August 5, 1987 -- just at the moment of the signing of the Esquipulas accords that brought him a Nobel Peace prize -- establishing a professional army in all but name, with the full array of ranks and structure; and a 1989 CODEHU report on the training of hundreds of men in military academies of the U.S., Taiwan, Honduras, Guatemala and Panama.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.23" HREF="#FN1.23">23</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Little of this has ever reached the United States, except far from the mainstream. In the context of the Drug War, however, some notice has been taken. An editorial in the <CITE>Miami Herald</CITE> on "Costa Rica's anguish" cites the comments by Sylvia Porras quoted above on the effects of U.S. military training, which has changed the "psychological profile" of the civilian police, turning them to "a camouflaged army." The judgment is not "hyperbole," the editorial concludes, attributing the rapid growth of the army and the recent killing of civilians by the security forces to the Nicaraguan conflict and the drug war -- but with no mention of U.S. pressures, following the norms of the Free Press.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.24" HREF="#FN1.24">24</A></FONT></SUP>


<H3>Good Intentions Gone Awry</H3>

<P>We may conclude this survey of the triumph of free market capitalism in Central America with a look at Panama, recently liberated by Operation Just Cause.

<P>In the months following the liberation, the successful affair largely disappeared from view,<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.25" HREF="#FN1.25">25</A></FONT></SUP> the normal pattern. U.S. goals had been achieved, the triumph had been properly celebrated, and there was little more to say except to record subsequent progress towards freedom, democracy, and good fortune -- or, if that strains credulity, to produce occasional musings on how the best of intentions go awry when we have such poor human material to work with.

<P>Central American sources continued to give considerable attention to the impact of the invasion on civilians, but they were ignored in the occasional reviews of the matter here. <CITE>New York Times</CITE> correspondent Larry Rohter devoted a column to casualty estimates on April 1, citing figures as high as 673 killed, and adding that higher figures, which he attributes only to Ramsey Clark, are "widely rejected" in Panama. He found Panamanian witnesses who described U.S. military actions as restrained, but none with less happy tales.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.26" HREF="#FN1.26">26</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Among the many readily accessible sources deemed unworthy of mention in the <CITE>Times</CITE> (and the media generally), we find such examples as the following.

<P>The Mexican press reported that two Catholic Bishops estimated deaths at perhaps 3000. Hospitals and nongovernmental human rights groups estimated deaths at over 2000.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.27" HREF="#FN1.27">27</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>A joint delegation of the Costa Rica-based Central American Human Rights Commission (CODEHUCA) and the Panamanian Human Rights Commission (CONADEHUPA) published the report of its January 20-30 inquiry, based on numerous interviews. It concluded that "the human costs of the invasion are substantially higher than the official U.S. figures" of 202 civilians killed, reaching 2-3000 according to "conservative estimates." Eyewitnesses interviewed in the urban slums report that U.S. helicopters aimed their fire at buildings with only civilian occupants, that a U.S. tank destroyed a public bus killing 26 passengers, that civilian residences were burned to the ground with many apartments destroyed and many killed, that U.S. troops shot at ambulances and killed wounded, some with bayonets, and denied access to the Red Cross. The Catholic and Episcopal Churches gave estimates of 3000 dead as "conservative." Civilians were illegally detained, particularly union leaders and those considered "in opposition to the invasion or nationalistic." "All the residences and offices of the political sectors that oppose the invasion have been searched and much of them have been destroyed and their valuables stolen." The U.S. imposed severe censorship. Human rights violations under Noriega had been "unacceptably high," the report continues, though of course "mild compared with the record of U.S.-supported regimes in Guatemala and El Salvador." But the U.S invasion "caused an unprecedented level of deaths, suffering, and human rights abuses in Panama." The title of the report is: "Panama: More than an invasion, ...a massacre."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.28" HREF="#FN1.28">28</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Since its topic is not Kuwait, the report passed without notice here.

<P>Sources at the University of Panama estimated at least 5000 dead; the head of the School of Public Administration at the University condemned the U.S. army's "iron control [which] will not allow access to any Panamian institution to find out the correct number of casualties."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.29" HREF="#FN1.29">29</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Physicians for Human Rights, with the concurrence of Americas Watch, reached tentative casualty figures higher than those given by the Pentagon but well below those of COHUDECA-CONADEHUPA and others in Panama. Their estimate is about 300 civilians killed. Americas Watch also gives a "conservative estimate" of at least 3000 wounded, concluding further that civilian deaths were four times as great as military deaths in Panama, and over ten times as high as U.S. casualties (officially given as 23; the U.S. military estimated civilian deaths at 202). They ask: "How does `surgical operation' result in almost ten civilians killed (by official U.S. count) for every American military casualty?" By September, the count of bodies exhumed from several of the mass graves had passed 600.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.30" HREF="#FN1.30">30</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Excavation of mass graves meanwhile continues. By September, the count of bodies found in these graves alone had reached well over 600.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.31" HREF="#FN1.31">31</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The COHUDECA-CONADEHUPA report emphasizes that a great deal is uncertain, because of the violent circumstances, the incineration of bodies, and the lack of records for persons buried in common graves without having reached morgues or hospitals, according to eyewitnesses. note: See CODEHUCA letter to Americas Watch, June 5, 1990, commenting on the Americas Watch report.} Its reports, and the many others of which a few have been cited here, may or may not be accurate. A media decision to ignore them, however, reflects not professional standards but a commitment to power.

<P>On September 30, some of this information finally broke into the mainstream media in a television report by CBS news ("60 minutes").<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.32" HREF="#FN1.32">32</A></FONT></SUP> Pictures of mass graves were shown, and a Panamanian woman who had worked for months to have a few of them opened and the remains identified, exhausting her own resources in the process, estimated civilian deaths at perhaps 4000. The CBS investigation also revealed new information: secret U.S. army reports estimating 1000 civilians killed -- not the 202 that were officially reported -- and urging that damage claims not be considered because the number might mount too high. There was also a (rare) report of thousands of Panamanians protesting against the U.S. invasion and occupation.

<P>While Larry Rohter's visits to the slums destroyed by U.S. bombardment located only celebrants, or critics of U.S. "insensitivity" at worst, others found a rather different picture. Mexico's leading newspaper reported in April that Rafael Olivardia, refugee spokesman for the 15,000 refugees of the devastated El Chorrillo neighborhood, "said that the El bloodbath' during and after saw North American tanks roll over the dead' during the invasion that left a total of more than 2000 dead and thousands injured, according to unofficial figures." "You only live once," Olivardia said, "and if you must die fighting for an adequate home, then the U.S. soldiers should complete the task they began" on December 20.

<P>The Spanish language press in the United States was less celebratory and deferential than its colleagues. Vicky Pelaez reports from Panama that "the entire world continues in ignorance about how the thousands of victims of the Northamerican invasion of Panama died and what kinds of weapons were used, because the Attorney-General of the country refuses to permit investigation of the bodies buried in the common graves." An accompanying photo shows workmen exhuming corpses from a grave containing "almost 200 victims of the invasion." Quoting a woman who found the body of her murdered father, Pelaez reports that "just like the woman vox populi' in Panama that the Northamericans used completely unknown armaments during the 20 December invasion." Olga Mejia, President of Panamanian Human Rights, informed the journal that "They converted Panama into a laboratory of horror. Here, they first experimented with methods of economic strangulation; then they successfully used a campaign of disinformation at the international level. But it was in the application of the most modern war technology that they demonstrated infernal mastery."  The CODEHUCA-CONADEHUPA report also alleges that "the U.S. Army used highly sophisticated weapons -- some for the first time in combat -- against unarmed civilian populations," and "in many cases no distinction was made between civilian and military targets."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.33" HREF="#FN1.33">33</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>One case of "highly sophisticated weapons" did receive some attention. F-117A stealth fighters were used in combat for the first time, dropping 2000-lb. bombs with time-delay mechanisms in a large open field near an airstrip and barracks that housed an elite PDF battalion. The Air Force had kept this plane under close wraps, refusing to release cost or performance data about it. "There were conflicting reports as to the rationale for employing the sophisticated aircraft, which cost nearly $50 million apiece, to conduct what appeared to be a simple operation," <CITE>Aviation Week & Space Technology</CITE> reported. The Panamanian air force has no fighters and no military aircraft were stationed permanently at the base that was attacked. Its only known air defenses "were a pair of aging small caliber antiaircraft guns." An American aeronautical engineering consultant and charter operator in Panama said he was "astonished" to learn of the use of the F-117A, pointing out that the target attacked did not even have radar: "They could have bombed it with any other aircraft and not been noticed." The aerospace journal cites Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's claim that the aircraft were used "because of its great accuracy," then suggesting its own answer to the puzzle: "By demonstrating the F-117A's capability to operate in low-intensity conflicts, as well as its intended mission to attack heavily defended Soviet targets, the operation can be used by the Air Force to justify the huge investment made in stealth technology" to "an increasingly skeptical Congress."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.34" HREF="#FN1.34">34</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>A similar conclusion was reached, more broadly, by Col. (Ret.) David Hackworth, a former combat commander who is one of the nation's most decorated soldiers. He described the Panama operation as technically efficient, though in his judgment "100 Special Forces guys" would have sufficed to capture Noriega, and "this big operation was a Pentagon attempt to impress Congress just when they're starting to cut back on the military." Other evidence lends credibility to these suggestions, including the White House National Security Strategy report presented to Congress in March 1990.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.35" HREF="#FN1.35">35</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>If these were indeed among the motives for the exercise, they may have suffered a slight setback when it turned out that one of the stealth fighter-bombers had missed its undefended target by more than 300 yards, despite its "great accuracy." Defense Secretary Cheney ordered an inquiry.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.36" HREF="#FN1.36">36</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The nature of the U.S. victory became clearer, along predictable lines, in the following months. Its character is described by Andres Oppenheimer in the <CITE>Miami Herald</CITE> in June, under the heading "Panama Flirts with Economic Recovery" -- that is, recovery from the depths to which it was plunged by illegal U.S. economic warfare, then invasion and occupation. But there is a qualification: "Six months after the U.S. invasion, Panama is showing signs of growing prosperity -- at least for the largely white-skinned business class that has regained its influence after more than two decades of military rule," the small minority of important people. The luxury shops are again full of goods, and "Panama's nightlife is also perking up" as "foreign tourists, mostly U.S. businessmen, can be seen most evenings sipping martinis in the lobbies of the biggest hotels," which are sometimes "booked solid -- a contrast to the moribund atmosphere there before the invasion." Newspapers are filled with ads from department stores, banks, and insurance firms. "The upper class and the middle classes are doing great," a Western European diplomat observes: "They had the money in U.S. bank accounts and are bringing it back to the country. But the poor are in bad shape, because the government is bankrupt and can't help them."  "The Catholic Church has begun to denounce what it sees as a lack of government concern for the poor," Oppenheimer continues. An editorial in a Church weekly "lashed out at authorities for devoting their energies to helping the private sector while breaking their original promises not to fire low-income public workers."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.37" HREF="#FN1.37">37</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Chalk up another victory for capitalism and democracy.

<P>On August 2, the Catholic bishops of Panama issued a pastoral letter condemning U.S. "interference in the country's internal affairs" and denouncing the December invasion as "a veritable tragedy in the annals of the country's history." The statement also condemned Washington's failure to provide aid to the people who continue to suffer from the invasion, and criticized the government for ignoring their plight. Their protest appears in the Guatemala City <CITE>Central America Report</CITE> under the heading "Church Raises Its Voice" -- though not loudly enough to be heard in Washington and New York. The same report quotes the Mexican daily <CITE>Excelsior</CITE> on U.S. military maneuvers in the mountains of Panama, and the high visibility of U.S. troops throughout the capital and other areas of the country.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.38" HREF="#FN1.38">38</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>In April, President Endara had appointed a commission (the Panamanian Commission for National Reconstruction) to deal with the problem of reconstructing the economy that had been devastated by the U.S. economic sanctions, then the invasion and its aftermath. Its report, issued in August, proposed a three-point plan: a truce, political amnesty, and the end of "occupation of the State and its territory" by U.S. troops. Special emphasis was placed on the consequences of the U.S. invasion, and the demand for the end to the military occupation and reestablishment of Panamanian sovereignty.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.39" HREF="#FN1.39">39</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>In the British journal <CITE>Race and Class,</CITE> Joy James reviews some relevant history. The White (European) sector, which owns most of the land and resources, is estimated at about 8% of the population. The "two decades of military rule" to which the <CITE>Miami Herald</CITE> refers had some other characteristics as well. The Torrijo dictatorship had a populist character, which largely ended after his death in 1981 in an airplane accident (with various charges about the cause), and the subsequent Noriega takeover. During this period, Blacks, Mestizo, and Indigenous Panamanians gained their first share of power, and economic and land reforms were undertaken. In these two decades, infant mortality declined from 40% to less than 20% and life expectancy increased by nine years. New hospitals, health centers, houses, schools and universities were built, and more doctors, nurses and teachers were trained. Indigenous communities were granted autonomy and protection for their traditional lands, to an extent unmatched in the hemisphere. For the first time, Panama moved to an independent foreign policy, still alive in the 1980s to an extent, as Panama participated in the Contadora peace efforts (one of the main reasons why Noriega was transmuted from good guy to devil). The Canal Treaty was signed in 1977, theoretically awarding control over the Canal to Panama by the year 2000, though the prospects are doubtful. The Reagan administration took the position that "when the Carter-Torrijos treaties are being renegotiated" -- an eventuality taken for granted -- "the prolongation of the US military presence in the Panama Canal area till well after the year 2000 should be brought up for discussion" (State Department).<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.40" HREF="#FN1.40">40</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The post-invasion moves to place Panamanian military forces under U.S. control may be motivated by more than just the normal commitment to this doctrine. It will probably be argued that Panama is not in a position to defend the Canal as the Treaty requires, so that U.S. bases must be retained.

<P>The U.S. sanctions largely dismantled the reforms of the Torrijo period. Poverty rose rapidly, and the unions virtually collapsed. The invasion and the U.S. post-invasion rule are likely to administer the coup de grace to these populist efforts.

<P>In August, government economists warned that more than 300,000 Panamanians are unemployed or underemployed, some 40% of the population. One leading economist and former high government planning official reported that 44% of the population lives in poverty, 24% in "extreme poverty," and that 93,800 infants and pre-school children live "in misery," while 35% of infants are malnourished. To check rising unemployment, he estimates, 190,000 jobs new jobs will be needed this year alone.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.41" HREF="#FN1.41">41</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The problems faced by the usual victims are described out of the mainstream by labor journalist Daphne Wysham. She reports that the U.S. invasion virtually completed the destruction of the Panamanian trade unions. The general secretary of the Inter-American Regional Organization of Workers (ORIT), Luis Anderson, condemned the invading troops for arresting three top Panamanian labor leaders. "Many union offices have been raided and sacked. The journalists union has been banned." These steps by the occupying forces are part of a more general attack on independent politics. In an interview before the invasion, one Panamian labor leader later detained by U.S. troops reported that he and other union leaders were informed by the State Department that they were on a list of people who would be eliminated if they didn't "get their feet in support of the opposition" to Noriega. Union activists interviewed by Joy James report similar pre-invasion threats by the AFL-CIO, which, they say, is now working to create a new "parallel organization" that will be better-behaved, following its traditional union-busting policies..

<P>Teresa Guttierez, a spokesperson for former U.S. Attorney-General Ramsey Clark, who heads a Panamanian inquiry commission, reports that new labor laws disallow the right to hold union meetings, the right to protest, and the right to strike, and that trade unionists are rounded up on a regular basis and held without charges.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.42" HREF="#FN1.42">42</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The same picture emerges from the occasional reports in the mainstream media. Pamela Constable reports that "bankers and business owners" find that things are looking up, though "a mood of anger and desperation permeates the underclass" in "the blighted shantytowns." Vice-president Guillermo Ford says that "The stores have reopened 100 percent, and the private sector is very enthusiastic. I think we're on the road to a very solid future." Under his "proposed recovery program," public enterprises would be sold off, "the labor code would be revised to allow easier dismissal of workers and tax-free export factories would be set up to lure foreign capital."

<P>Business leaders "are bullish on Ford's ideas," Constable continues. In contrast, "Labor unions are understandably wary of these proposals," but "their power has become almost negligible" with "massive dismissals of public workers who supported Noriega and the unprecedented jobless rate." The U.S. emergency aid package approved by Congress is intended largely "to make back payments on Panama's foreign debt and shore up its creditworthiness with foreign lending institutions"; in translation: it is a taxpayer subsidy to international banks, foreign investors, and the important people in Panama. The thousands of refugees from El Chorillo, now living in what some of them call "a concentration camp," will not be returning to the devastated slum. The original owners, who had long wanted "to transform this prime piece of real estate into a posher district," may now be able to do so. Noriega had stood in the way of these plans, allowing the poor to occupy housing there rent-free. But by bombing the neighborhood into rubble and then levelling the charred ruins with bulldozers, U.S. forces overcame "that ticklish legal and human obstacle" to these intentions, Constable reports.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.43" HREF="#FN1.43">43</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>With unemployment skyrocketing, nearly half the population cannot meet essential food needs. Crime has quadrupled. Aid is designated for businesses and foreign banks (debt repayment). It could be called the "Central Americanization" of Panama, correspondent Brook Larmer aptly observes in the <CITE>Christian Science Monitor</CITE>.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.44" HREF="#FN1.44">44</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The U.S. occupying forces continue to leave little to chance. The Mexican journal <CITE>Excelsior</CITE> reports that the U.S. forces have established direct control over ministries and public institutions. According to an organization chart leaked to the journal by political and diplomatic sources, U.S. controls extend to all provinces, the Indian community, the Town Halls of the ten major cities, and the regional police offices. "Washington's objective is to have a strategic network in this country to permanently control all the actions and decisions of the government." With the establishment of this "parallel government" closely controlling all decision-making, "things have returned to the way they were before 1968 in Panama." The journal scheduled an interview with President Endara to discuss the matter, but it was cancelled without explanation.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.45" HREF="#FN1.45">45</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The report provides extensive details, including names of U.S. officials and the tasks assigned them in the organization chart. All of this could easily be checked by U.S. reporters, if home offices were interested. They are not. "The information that we reveal here," <CITE>Excelsior</CITE> reports, "is supposed to be known only to very restricted groups" -- not including the U.S. public.

<P>The regime put in power is to be a well-behaved puppet, with no populist heresies or thoughts of independence. That is the firm policy goal. It might well have been the policy goal of Saddam Hussein in Kuwait, had international sanctions not been applied in outrage over his nefarious aggression. The efficient way, after all, is to rule through locals who can be trusted, with ample force on the ready, just in case.

<P>The occupying forces are not only dedicated to restoring the rule of the traditional European oligarchy and its foreign associates, but also to ensuring that the project is not troubled by such irritants as freedom of expression. <CITE>Excelsior</CITE> reports that "United States intelligence services exercise control not only over local information media but also over international news agencies," according to the president of the Journalist Union of Panama. He adds that the goal is to make the world believe that there is freedom and democracy, whereas in reality broadcast stations have been taken over and placed "in custody" and dozens of journalists have been fired. An opposition activist alleges that the first Panamanian publishing company, ERSA, with three daily papers, was occupied by U.S. tanks and security forces "in order to turn it over to a businessman who had lost it in a lawsuit," a member of an oligarchical family that "favors the interventionist line of the United States."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.46" HREF="#FN1.46">46</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>According to Ramsey Clark's Independent Commission of Inquiry, the offices of the daily <CITE>La Republica</CITE> "were ransacked and looted by U.S. troops the day after the newspaper reported on the large number of deaths caused by the U.S. invasion." Its editor was arrested and held for six weeks by U.S. troops, then sent to a Panamanian prison without charges. The publisher of one of the few opposition voices was arrested in March on charges of alleged misconduct when he was a government minister, and the government closed a radio station for broadcasting editorials critical of the U.S. invasion and the government it established.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.47" HREF="#FN1.47">47</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Miguel Antonio Bernal, a leading Panamanian intellectual and anti-Noriega activist, writes that "freedom of press is again under siege in Panama." Vice-president Ricardo Arias Calderon has proposed a new law to restrict press criticism of the government, saying that "We will not tolerate criticism." He has also urged stockholders of Panama's largest newspaper, <CITE>La Prensa,</CITE> to fire its editor and founder Roberto Eisenman because of the journal's criticism of the government, and has called on members of his Christian Democratic Party to work for Eisenman's ouster.  Describing such acts, the increasing terror, and the reconstruction of the military with Noriega associates who were implicated in drug running and corruption, Bernal asks why the U.S. is "turning the same blind eye" as in the past to these developments.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.48" HREF="#FN1.48">48</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Bernal's question is surely rhetorical. Latin Americans know the answer very well, though the question could hardly be addressed in the fanatically ideological intellectual culture to the North.

<P>Not only the military, but the bankers and businessmen restored to power in the December invasion as well had close links to the drug trade. Justice Department and Senate inquiries had identified Panamanian banks as major conduits for drug money in the early 1980s, when Noriega was still a great friend, and high officials of the new government, including President Endara, were closely involved with banks charged with money laundering as directors or in other ways. In September, the U.S. Embassy "implicated President Endara in a money laundering scheme" (<CITE>Central America Report,</CITE> Guatemala). DEA officials accused 7 Panamanian banks of laundering drug money and protecting the accounts of drug-traffickers, including the Interbanco, directed by Endara until he took over the presidency in January 1990, which was charged with protecting millions of dollars belonging to Colombian druglord Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha (since killed). U.S. Ambassador Hinton charged further that the "Colombian mafia" continues to use Panama for drug shipment to Europe and the United States. At the heart of the controversy is a U.S. demand for access to information about bank depositors in Panama, which the financial community there claims would undermine the international banking sector by eliminating confidentiality (and might be used for the U.S. for its own purposes under a drug cover). The alleged U.S. concerns about drug trafficking might be a bit more credible if we were to witness raids by Delta Force on the executive headquarters of the U.S. corporations that supply the drug cartel with the chemicals they need for cocaine production -- or if the U.S. government were not applying strong pressures on Asian countries to remove barriers on advertising and marketing of lethal addictive drugs produced in the United States (tobacco, a far worse killer than cocaine).<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.49" HREF="#FN1.49">49</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Those not restricted to the quality press here will also learn that President Endara's government received "one of its worst diplomatic setbacks" on March 30, when it was formally ousted from the Group of Eight (now Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay, Venezuela), what are considered the major Latin American democracies. Panama had been suspended from the group in 1988 in reaction to Noriega's repression, and with the further deterioration of the political climate under foreign occupation, Panama was ousted permanently at the March meeting of foreign ministers. The Group of Eight, now Seven, issued a resolution stating that "the process of democratic legitimation in Panama requires popular consideration without foreign interference, that guarantees the full right of the people to freely choose their governments." The resolution also indicated that the operations of the U.S. military are affecting Panama's sovereignty and independence as well as the legality of the Endara government. This decision extends the pattern of strong Latin American opposition to the earlier U.S. measures against Panama and the invasion, from the outset, when the Organization of American States condemned U.S. moves by a vote of 17-1 (U.S. opposed) in July 1987. As the media here barely noted, President Endara's inaugural address four weeks after the invasion was boycotted by virtually all Latin American ambassadors.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.50" HREF="#FN1.50">50</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The Washington-media position is that the Endara government is legitimate, having won the 1989 elections that were stolen by Noriega. Latin American opinion commonly takes a different view.

<P>In 1989, Endara was running against Noriega, with extensive U.S. backing, open and covert. Furthermore, the elections were conducted under conditions caused by the illegal U.S. economic warfare that was demolishing the economy. The United States was therefore holding a whip over the electorate. For that reason alone the elections were far from free and uncoerced, by any sensible standards. Today, the political scene is quite different -- or would be, if the U.S. were to tolerate political activity and free expression. On these grounds, there would be every reason to organize a new election, contrary to the wishes of Endara and his U.S. sponsors. Polls in Panama show that over half the population would vote for a new party or new alliance if elections were to be permitted.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.51" HREF="#FN1.51">51</A></FONT></SUP> The official position is offered by Michael Massing in the <CITE>New York Review of Books</CITE>. Reporting from Panama, he writes that Endara's willingness to "go along" with the U.S. request that he assume the presidency "has caused the leaders of some Latin American countries, such as Peru, to question his legitimacy." "The Panamanians themselves, however, have few such qualms," because his "clear victory" in the 1989 election "provided Endara with all the credentials he needs." Citation of Peru for dragging its feet is a deft move, since President Garcia was an official enemy of the U.S. who had been recalcitrant about Nicaragua, had restricted debt payment, and in general failed to observe proper standards; best to overlook the rest of the Group of Eight, however, among "some Latin American countries." As for the views of "the Panamanians themselves," no further indication is given as to how this information was obtained.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.52" HREF="#FN1.52">52</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Massing reports on the police raids in poor neighborhoods, the protests of homeless and hungry people demanding jobs and housing, the reconstruction of Noriega's PDF, the restoration of the oligarchy with a "successful corporate lawyer" at the head of a government "largely made up of businessmen," who receive U.S.  corporate visitors sponsored by OPIC (which ensures U.S. investments abroad) "as if they were visiting heads of state." The business climate is again "attractive" in this "land ruled by merchants, marketers, and moneylenders." "The government is drafting plans to revive Panama's banking industry, relax its labor laws, expand the free trade zone, and attract foreign investors," and to privatize state enterprises and "radically cut public spending."

<P>Drawn from the "tiny white elite" of under 10% of the population, the government has been accused of "wanting to turn the clock back to 1968, when a small rich group ruled the country" -- namely, exactly the group now restored to power. But "the charge is unfair," Massing comments -- much like the charge that the conservative populists swept into office in the democratic wave of free elections in Central America might have something on their minds other than helping the poor when they opt for a trickle-down strategy. The proof that the charge is unfair, Massing explains, is that when employees from Air Panama fearful of losing their jobs held a vigil outside his office, President Endara "sent them coffee and made a point of talking with them."  What is more, while fasting in the Cathedral in an effort to expedite U.S. aid (or to lose weight, some unkind locals quipped), "he invited striking sanitation workers in for a chat and eventually negotiated a settlement." Furthermore, Vice-President Arias Calderon has said that he wants the government to correct disparities created by the market. True, no projects that might illustrate these plans "are in the works" and the Endara government "opposes the idea" of using U.S. aid for such purposes, "determined to leave virtually everything to the private sector." But that proves nothing, in the face of the powerful evidence showing that "the charge is unfair," just reviewed in its entirety.

<P>Massing is not pleased with the outcome, particularly, the restoration of Noriega's PDF, "despite all the good intentions" of the United States (taken as given, in accordance with the norms of the intellectual culture), and its efforts "to atone for its past misbehavior." The problem does not lie in the U.S. military aid programs, which have trained security forces that "have been guilty of horrible excesses" in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Noriega's Panama (and other cases unmentioned). Rather, the problem lies in what the U.S. "had to work with." It's those folks who are bad, not us, please.

<P>The consistent effects of our military training, the policies of which it is a part, the documentary record explaining the reasons -- all may be put aside, irrelevant, along with all of history. We are always willing to admit that there were aberrations in the past. But at every moment of time, we have changed course and put the errors of the past behind us.

<P>We are Good, our intentions are Good. Period.

<P>The first part of this series (<CITE>Z,</CITE> November) opened with the conventional interpretation of the past decade: the U.S. won the Cold War, a victory for the forces of righteousness. We then turned to the question that would at once come to the mind of anyone apart from the most fanatic ideologue: How are the victors faring at this historic moment, as they celebrate their triumph? We looked first at those who should be the most overjoyed because of their unusual good fortune: our "little brown brothers" in Central America and Panama, who have long been under the protective wing of the leader of the crusade, becoming a foreign policy obsession in the past decade. The conditions of their existence help us understand why the obvious questions about the Grand Victory of democracy and free market capitalism are so scrupulously avoided in polite and cultivated circles. Needless to say, the beneficiaries of our solicitude have some thoughts of their own about these matters. We will turn in the final section to their interpretation of the triumph of capitalism and freedom, and the nobility of their protector -- thoughts that do not penetrate the well-disciplined commissar culture at home.

<P>Let us now extend the survey to other regions where the virtuous leaders of the crusade for freedom and justice have long held sway and have thus been able to realize their noble objectives with no more than marginal interference from Communists and other evil forces, beginning with the rest of Latin America.


<H3>The Fruits Of Victory: Latin America</H3>

<P>A World Bank study in 1982 estimated that "40 percent of households in Latin America live in poverty, meaning that they cannot purchase the minimum basket of goods required for the satisfaction of their basic needs, and...20 percent of all households live in destitution, meaning that they lack the means of buying even the food that would provide them with a minimally adequate diet." The situation became far worse through the victorious 1980s, largely because of the huge export of capital to the West. From 1982 to 1987 this amounted to about $250 billion, 25 times the total value of the Alliance for Progress and 15 times the Marshall Plan. The Bank for International Settlements in Switzerland estimates that between 1978 and 1987, some $170 billion in flight capital left Latin America, not including money hidden by falsified trade transactions. The New York Times cites another estimate that anonymous capital flows, including drug money and flight capital, total $600 billion to $800 billion.

<P>This huge hemorrhage is part of a complicated system whereby Western banks and Latin American elites enrich themselves at the expense of the general population of Latin America, which is saddled with the "debt crisis" that results from these manipulations, and of taxpayers in the Western countries who are ultimately called upon to foot part of the bill. These are among the triumphs of free market capitalism that we now celebrate -- apart from a few perpetual complainers who are "as welcome as gnats at a nudist party," a New York Times reviewer comments, referring to Murray Bookchin.

<P>Speaking in Washington in preparation for the 1989 General Assembly of the OAS, which he headed, Brazilian President Soares described the 1980s as a "lost decade" for Latin America, with falling personal income and general economic stagnation or decline. In 1988 average income had fallen to the level of 1978. There was a further decline in 1989, and the export of capital continued in a flood, the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean reported.

<P>According to World Bank figures, average per capita income in Argentina fell from $1,990 in 1980 to $1,630 in 1988. Mexico's GNP declined for seven straight years. Real wages in Venezuela has fallen by a third since 1981, to the 1964 level. Argentina allotted 20 percent of its budget to education in 1972, 6 percent in 1986. David Felix, a leading specialist on Latin American economics, writes that per capita output and real investment per worker declined sharply in the 1980s, the latter falling to below 1970 levels in most of the heavily indebted countries, where urban real wages are in many cases 20 percent to 40 percent below 1980 levels, even below 1970 levels.  The brain drain quickened and physical and human capital per head shrank because of the decline of public and private investment and collapse of infrastructure. Much of the sharp deterioration of the 1980s, Felix and others conclude, can be traced to the free-market restructuring imposed by the industrial powers.

<P>Mexicans continue to flee to the United States for survival, and macabre stories abound, some hard to believe but important for what they indicate about the prevailing mood. Reporting the annual meeting of the Border Commission on Human Rights in Mexico, Mexico's leading daily (Excelsior) alleges that actions of the U.S. Border Patrol cause the drowning of persons seeking to cross the river to the United States. A representative of the regional Human Rights Committee told the session that 1,000 people had disappeared without a trace after leaving their homes to enter the U.S. illegally. She "also added that the disappearance or theft of women for the extraction of organs for use in transplants in the U.S. is common." Others reported torture, high rates of cancer from chemicals used in the maquiladora industries (mainly subsidiaries of transnationals supplying U.S. factories), secret prisons, kidnapping, and other horror stories. The journal also reports a study by environmental groups, presented to President Salinas, claiming that 100,000 children die every year as a result of pollution in the Mexico City area, along with millions suffering from pollution-induced disease, which has reduced life expectancy by an estimated 10 years. The "main culprit" is the emissions of lead and sulfur from operations of the national petrochemical company Pemex, which is free from the controls imposed elsewhere -- one of the advantages of Third World production that is not lost on investors.

<P>The Mexican Secretariat of Urban Development and the Environment described the situation as "truly catastrophic," Excelsior reports further, estimating that less than 10 percent of Mexican territory is able to support "minimally productive agriculture" because of environmental degradation, while water resources are hazardously low.  Many areas are turning into "a real museum of horrors" from pollution because of the blind pursuit of profits on the part of national and international private capital. The Secretariat estimates further that more than 90 percent of industry in the Valley of Mexico, where there are more than 30,000 plants, violate global standards, and in the chemical industry, more than half the labor force suffers irreversible damage to the respiratory system.

<P>Maude Barlow, chairperson of a Canadian study group, reports the results of their inquiry into maquiladoras "built by Fortune 500 to take advantage of a desperate people," for profits hard to match elsewhere. They found factories full of teenage girls, some 14-years-old, "working at eye-damaging, numbingly repetitive work" for wages "well below what is required for even a minimum standard of living." Corporations commonly send the most dangerous jobs here because standards on chemicals are "lax or non-existent." "In one plant," she writes, "we all experienced headaches and nausea from spending an hour on the assembly line" and "we saw young girls working beside open vats of toxic waste, with no protective face covering."  Unions are barred, and there is an ample reserve army of desperate people ready to take the place of any who "are not happy, or fall behind in quotas, or become ill or pregnant." The delegation "took pictures of a lagoon of black, bubbling toxic waste dumped by plants in an industrial park," following it to "where it met untreated raw sewage and turned into a small river running past squatters' camps (where children covered in sores drank Pepsi Cola from baby bottles) to empty into the Tijuana River."

<P>It is more fashionable to bemoan the environmental and human catastrophes of Eastern Europe, the results of an evil system now happily overcome in a victory for our humane values.

<P>Colombia is another success story of capitalist democracy, flawed only by the drug cartels -- and for some of those gnats who still fail to appreciate the wonders of our system, by such marginal problems as the murder of "subversives" -- such as 1,000 members of the leading opposition party and 3 of its presidential candidates -- by death squads in league with the security forces.

<P>There is also a background, though one would be hard put to find a discussion of it in recent commentary on U.S. efforts to aid the Colombian military in the "war against drugs." The topic is addressed in a discussion of human rights in Colombia by Alfredo Vasquez Carrizosa, president of the Colombian Permanent Committee for Human Rights. "Behind the facade of a constitutional regime," he observes, "we have a militarized society under the state of siege provided" by the 1886 Constitution. The Constitution grants a wide range of rights, but they have no relation to reality. "In this context poverty and insufficient land reform have made Colombia one of the most tragic countries of Latin America." Land reform, which "has practically been a myth," was legislated in 1961, but "has yet to be implemented, as it is opposed by landowners, who have had the power to stop it" -- again, no defect of `'democracy," by Western standards. The result of the prevailing misery has been violence, including <I>la Violencia</I> of the 1940s and 1950s, which took hundreds of thousands of lives. "This violence has been caused not by any mass indoctrination, but by the dual structure of a prosperous minority and an impoverished, excluded majority, with great differences in political participation," the familiar story.

<P>The story has another familiar thread. "But in addition to internal factors," Vasquez Carrizosa continues, "violence has been exacerbated by external factors. In the 1960s the United States, during the Kennedy administration, took great pains to transform our regular armies into counterinsurgency brigades, accepting the new strategy of the death squads." These Kennedy initiatives "ushered in what is known in Latin America as the National Security Doctrine, ...not defense against an external enemy, but a way to make the military establishment the masters of the game... [with] the right to combat the internal enemy, as set forth in the Brazilian doctrine, the Argentine doctrine, the Uruguayan doctrine, and the Colombian doctrine: it is the right to fight and to exterminate social workers, trade unionists, men and women who are not supportive of the establishment, and who are assumed to be communist extremists. And this could mean anyone, including human rights activists such as myself."

<P>A study by Evan Vallianatos of the U.S. government Office of Technology Assessment amplifies the dimensions of the victory of capitalist democracy here. "Colombia's twentieth century history is above all stained in the blood of the peasant poor," he writes, reviewing the gruesome record of atrocities and massacre to keep the mass of the population in its place. The U.S. Aid program, the Ford Foundation, and others have sought to deal with the plight of the rural population "by refining the largely discredited trickle-down technology and knowledge transfer process," investing in the elite and trusting in "competition, private property, and the mechanism of the free market" -- a system in which "the big fish eats the small one," as one poor farmer observes. These policies have made the dreadful conditions still worse, creating "the most gross inequalities that the beast in man has made possible." It is not only the rural poor who have suffered beyond endurance. To illustrate the kind of development fostered by the multinational corporations and the technocrats, Vallianatos offers the example of the small industrial city of Yumbo, "rapidly becoming unfit for human habitation" because of uncontrolled pollution, decay, and "corrosive slums" in which "the town's spent humanity has all but given up."

<P>Another victory for our side.

<P>Brazil is another country with rich resources and potential, long subject to European influence, then U.S. intervention, primarily since the Kennedy years. We cannot, however, simply speak of "Brazil."  There are two very different Brazils. In a major scholarly study of the Brazilian economy, Peter Evans writes that "the fundamental conflict in Brazil is between the 1, or perhaps 5, percent of the population that comprises the elite and the 80 percent that has been left out of the `Brazilian model' of development." The Brazilian journal <CITE>Veja</CITE> reports on these two Brazils, the first modern and westernized, the second sunk in the deepest misery. Seventy percent of the population consumes fewer calories than Iranians, Mexicans, or Paraguayans. Over half the population have family incomes below the minimum wage. For 40 percent of the population, the median annual salary is $287, while inflation skyrockets and necessities are beyond reach. A World Bank report on the Brazilian educational system compares it unfavorably to Ethiopia and Pakistan, with a dropout rate of 80 percent in primary school, growing illiteracy, and falling budgets. The Ministry of Education reports that the government spends over a third of the education budget on school meals, because most of the students will either eat at school or not at all.

<P>The journal South, which describes itself as "The Business Magazine of the Developing World," reports on Brazil under the heading "The Underside of Paradise." A country with enormous wealth, no security concerns, a relatively homogeneous population, and a favorable climate, Brazil nevertheless has problems: "The problem is that this cornucopia is inhabited by a population enduring social conditions among the worst in the world. Two-thirds do not get enough to eat.  Brazil has a higher infant mortality rate than Sri Lanka, a higher illiteracy rate than Paraguay, and worse social indicators than many far poorer African countries. Fewer children finish first-grade school than in Ethiopia, fewer are vaccinated than in Tanzania and Botswana. Thirty-two percent of the population lives below the poverty line. Seven million abandoned children beg, steal and sniff glue on the streets. For scores of millions, home is a shack in a slum, a room in the inner city, or increasingly, a patch of ground under a bridge."

<P>The share of the poorer classes in the national income is "steadily falling, giving Brazil probably the highest concentration of income in the world." It has no progressive income tax or capital gains tax, but it does have galloping inflation and a huge foreign debt, while participating in a "Marshall Plan in reverse," in the words of former President Jose Samey, referring to debt payments.

<P>For three-quarters of the population of this cornucopia, the conditions of Eastern Europe are dreams beyond reach, another triumph of the Free World.

<P>A UN "Report on Human Development" ranks Brazil, with the world's eighth-largest economy, in 80th place in general welfare (as measured by education, health, and hygiene), near Albania, Paraguay, and Thailand. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) announced on October 18 that more than 40 percent of the population (almost 53 million people) are hungry. The Brazilian Health Ministry estimates that 840,000 children aged 1-4 and 420,000 newborns will die of hunger this year.

<P>Here too it is widely alleged that babies are sacrificed for organ banks, a belief that can hardly be true but that reveals much about the conditions under which it can take root. The Honduran press reported that Brazilian babies had been rescued from a gang that "intended to sacrifice them to organ banks in the United States, according to a charge in the courts." Brazil's Justice Ministry ordered federal police to investigate allegations that adopted children are being used for organ transplants in Europe, a practice "known to exist in Mexico and Thailand," the London Guardian reports, adding that "handicapped children are said to be preferred for transplant operations" and reviewing the process by which children in Brazil are kidnapped, "disappeared," or given up by impoverished mothers, then adopted or used for transplants.

<P>It would only be fair to add that the authorities are concerned with the mounting problem of homeless and starving children and are trying to reduce their numbers. Amnesty International reports that death squads, often run by the police, are killing street children at a rate of about one a day, while "many more children, forced onto the streets to support their families, are being beaten and tortured by the police" (Reuters, citing AI). "Poor children in Brazil are treated with contempt by the authorities, risking their lives simply by being on the streets," AI alleges. Most of the torture takes place under police custody or in state institutions. There are few complaints by victims or witnesses because of fear of the police, and the few cases that are investigated judicially result in light sentences.

<P>Recall that these are the conditions that hold on the 25th anniversary of "the single most decisive victory of freedom in the mid-twentieth century" (Kennedy Ambassador Lincoln Gordon), that is, the overthrow of parliamentary democracy by Brazilian generals backed by the United States, which then praised the "economic miracle" produced by the neo-Nazi national security state they established. In the months before the generals' coup, Washington assured its traditional military allies of its support and provided them with aid, because the military was essential to "the strategy for restraining left-wing excesses" of the elected Goulart government, Gordon cabled the State Department. The U.S. actively supported the coup, preparing to intervene directly if its help was needed for what Gordon described as the "democratic rebellion" of the generals. This "de facto ouster" of the elected president was "a great victory for the free world," Gordon reported with joy, adding that it should "create a greatly improved climate for private investment." U.S. labor leaders also demanded their proper share of the credit for the overthrow of the parliamentary regime, as the new government placed in power by the generals proceeded to smash the labor movement and subordinate poor and working people to the overriding needs of business interests, primarily foreign. Secretary of State Dean Rusk justified U.S. recognition for the obviously illegal regime on the grounds that "the succession there occurred as foreseen by the [Brazilian] Constitution," which had just been blatantly violated. The U.S. proceeded to provide ample aid as torture and repression mounted, the relics of constitutional Government faded away, and the climate for investors improved under the rule of what Washington hailed as the "democratic forces."

<P>These events in Latin America's most powerful state initiated a domino effect throughout the continent, leading to an unprecedented plague of repression under the National Security doctrines crafted by the military and political leaders of the hemisphere and their U.S.  advisers.

<P>The circumstances of the poor in Brazil continue to regress as austerity measures are imposed on the standard International Monetary Fund formula in an effort to deal somehow with this catastrophe of capitalism. The austerity measures initiated by President Collor de Mello were initially described as "populist," harmful mostly to the wealthy. Predictably, reality took a different course. Ken Silverstein reports that half a year after the measures were inaugurated, "the rich are reassured." The IMF measures primarily harmed the poor, while wealthy individuals and large companies were able to find ways to enrich themselves by exploiting measures that in theory were devised to impose the main burden on them. A study by the J. Walter Thompson agency concluded that "Collor's policies are not a threat to the wealthy.... The rich are now leading absolutely normal lives" (agency vice-president Celia Chiavolle). Businessmen, bankers, and the U.S.  Chamber of Commerce express their pleasure in the course of policy, while "the working class has been pushed to the wall," Silverstein adds, with hundreds of thousands fired and purchasing power reduced to a historic low, well below minimal needs for about half the population.

<P>The situation is similar in Argentina, where the Christian Democratic Party called on its members to resign from the cabinet in March "in order not to validate, by their presence in the government, the anti-popular [economic] measures of the regime." In a further protest over these measures, the Party expelled the current Minister of the Economy. Experts say that the socioeconomic situation has become "unbearable."

<P>The terrible fate of Argentina is addressed in a report in the Washington Post by Eugene Robinson. One of the ten richest countries in the world at the turn of the century, with rich resources and great advantages, Argentina is becoming a Third World country, Robinson observes. About one-third of its 31 million inhabitants live below the poverty line. Some 18,000 children die each year before their first birthday, most from malnutrition and preventable disease The capital, once considered "the most elegant and European city this side of the Atlantic," is "ringed by a widening belt of shantytowns, called <I>villas miserias,</I> or `miseryvilles,' where the homes are cobbled- together huts and the sewers are open ditches." Here too the IMF-style reforms "have made life even more precarious for the poor"

<P>Robinson's article is paired with another entitled "A Glimpse Into the Lower Depths," devoted to a mining town in the Soviet Union Subtitled "A mining town on the steppes reveals `the whole sick system'," the article stresses the comparison to capitalist success. The article on Argentina, however, says nothing about any "sick system." The only hint of a reason for the catastrophe in Argentina, or the general "economic malaise" in Latin America, is in a statement by a planning minister that "we destroyed ourselves" by "economic mismanagement."  Again the usual pattern: their crimes reveal their evil nature, ours are the result of personal failings and the poor human material with which we are forced to work in the Third World.

<P>David Felix concludes that Argentina's decline results from "political factors such as prolonged class warfare and a lack of national commitment on the part of Argentina's elite," which took advantage of the free-market policies of the murderous military dictatorship that were much admired here. These led to massive redistribution of income towards the wealthy and a sharp fall of per capita income, along with a huge increase in debt as a result of capital flight, tax evasion, and consumption by the rich beneficiaries of the "sick system" -- Reaganomics, in essence.

<P>In oil-rich Venezuela, over 40 percent live in extreme poverty according to official figures, and the food situation is considered "hyper-critical," the Chamber of Food Industries reported in 1989.  Malnutrition is so common that it is often not noted in medical histories, according to hospital officials, who warn that "the future is horrible." Prostitution has also increased, reaching the level of about 170,000 women or more, according to the Ministry of Health. The Ministry also reports an innovation, beyond the classic prostitution of women of low in-come. Many "executive secretaries and housewives and college students accompany tourists and executives during a weekend, earning at times up to [about $150] per contact."  Child prostitution is also increasing and is now "extremely widespread," along with child abuse.

<P>Brutal exploitation of women is a standard feature of the "economic miracles" in the realms of capitalist democracy. The huge flow of women from impoverished rural areas in Thailand to service the prostitution industry -- one of the success stories of the economic takeoff sparked by the Indochina wars -- is one of the many scandals that escape notice in the admiration for the Free World triumph. The savage conditions of work for young women largely from the rural areas are notorious; >young< women, because few others are capable of enduring the conditions of labor, or survive to continue with it.

<P>Chile under the Pinochet dictatorship is another famous success story.  Under the heading "Tyrant's `Success' Leaves 7 of 12 Million Chileans Poor," Antonio Garza Morales reports in Excelsior that "the social cost which has been paid by the Chilean people is the highest in Latin America," with the number of poor rising from 1 million after Allende to 7 million today, while the population remained stable at 12 million. Christian Democratic Party leader Senator Anselmo Sule, returned from exile, says that economic growth that benefits 10 percent of the population has been achieved (Pinochet's official institutions agree), but development has not. Unless the economic disaster for the majority is remedied, "we are finished," he adds. According to David Felix, "Chile, hit especially hard in the 1982-84 period, is now growing faster than during the preceding decade of the Chicago Boys," enthralled by the free market ideology that is, indeed, highly beneficial for some: the wealthy, crucially including foreign investors. Chile's recovery, Felix argues, can be traced to "a combination of severe wage repression by the Pinochet regime, an astutely managed bailout of the bankrupt private sector by the economic team that replaced the discredited Chicago Boys, and access to unusually generous lending by the international financial institutions," much impressed by the favorable climate for business operations.

<P>Environmental degradation is also a severe problem in Chile. The Chilean journal Apsi devoted a recent issue to the environmental crisis accelerated by the "radical neoliberalism" of the period following the U.S.-backed coup that overthrew the parliamentary democracy. Recent studies show that about half the country is becoming a desert, a problem that "seems much farther away than the daily poisoning of those who live in Santiago," the capital city, which competes with Sao Paolo (Brazil) and Mexico City for the pollution prize for the hemisphere (for the world, the journal alleges). "The liquid that emerges from the millions of faucets in the homes and alleys of Santiago have levels of copper, iron, magnesium and lead which exceed by many times the maximum tolerable norms." The land that "supplies the fruits and vegetables of the Metropolitan Region are irrigated with waters that exceed by 1,000 times the maximum quantity of coliforms acceptable," which is why Santiago "has levels of hepatitis, typhoid, and parasites which are not seen in any other part of the continent" (one of every three children has parasites in the capital). Economists and environmentalists attribute the problem to the "development model," crucially, its "transnational style," "in which the most important decisions tend to be adopted outside the ambit of the countries themselves," consistent with the assigned "function" of the Third World: to serve the needs of the industrial West.

<P>The fashion at home, as noted, is to attribute the problems of Eastern Europe to the "sick system" (quite accurately), while ignoring the catastrophes of capitalism or, on the rare occasions when some problem is noticed, attributing it to any cause other than the system that consistently brings it about. Latin American economists who have attributed the problems of the region to the "development model" are generally ignored, but some of them have been useful for ideological warfare and therefore have attained respectability in the U.S.  political culture. One example is Francisco Mayorga, a Yale Ph.D. in economics, who became one of the most respected commentators on the economic affairs of Nicaragua in the 1980s because he could be quoted on the economic debacle caused by the Sandinistas. He remained a U.S.  favorite as he became the economic Czar after the victory for the U.S.  candidate in the February 1990 election, though he disappeared from view when he was removed after the failure of his highly-touted recovery policies (which failed, in large part, because of U.S.  foot-dragging, the UNO government being nowhere near harsh and brutal enough for Washington's tastes).

<P>But Mayorga was never quoted on what he actually wrote about the Nicaraguan economy, which is not without interest. His 1986 Yale doctoral dissertation is a study of the consequences for Nicaragua of the development model of the U.S.-backed Somoza regime, and of the likely consequences of alternative policy choices for the 1980s. He concludes that "by 1978 the economy was on the verge of collapse" because of the "exhaustion of the agroindustrial model" and the "monetarist paradigm" that the U.S. favored. This model had led to huge debt and insolvency, and "the drastic downturn of the terms of trade that was around the corner was clearly going to deal a crucial blow to the agroindustrial model developed in the previous three decades," leading "inexorably" to an "economic slump in the 1980s." The immense costs of the U.S.-backed Somoza repression of 1978-9 and the contra war made the "inexorable" even more destructive. Mayorga estimates capital flight from 1977 to 1979 at $500 million, and calculates the "direct economic burden" of war from 1978 to 1984 at more than $3.3 billion. That figure, he points out, is one and a half times the "record GDP level of the country in 1977," a year of "exceptional affluence" because of the destruction of the Brazilian coffee crop, hence regularly used by U.S. propagandists (including some who masquerade as scholars) as a base line to prove Sandinista failures. The course of the economy from 1980, Mayorga concludes, was the result of the collapse of the agroindustrial export model, the severe downturn in the terms of trade, and the unbearable burden of the 1978-9 war and then the contra war (his study ends before the U.S. embargo exacerbated the crisis further). Sandinista policies, he concludes, were ineffective in dealing with the "inexorable" collapse: they "had a favorable impact on output and a negative effect on rural wages and farming profits," favoring industrial profits and redistributing income "from the rural to the urban sector." Had there been "no war and no change in economic regime," his studies show, "the Nicaraguan economy would have entered a sharp slump."

<P>These conclusions being useless or worse, Mayorga's actual work on the Nicaraguan economy passes into the same oblivion as all other inquiries into the catastrophes of capitalism. The example is noteworthy because of Mayorga's prominence, at the very same time, insofar as he could serve a propaganda function for the media.


<H3>The Fruits Of Victory: The Caribbean</H3>

<P>Brazil and Chile are not the only countries to have basked in praise for their achievements after U.S. intervention set them on the right course. Another is the Dominican Republic. After the latest U.S.  invasion under Lyndon Johnson in 1965, and a dose of death squads and torture, democratic forms were established, and U.S. commentators have expressed much pride in the peaceful transfer of power -- or better, governmental authority, power lying elsewhere. The economy is stagnant and near bankrupt, public services function only intermittently, poverty is endemic, malnutrition is increasing, and the standard of living of the poor continues its downward slide. In the capital city, electricity supply is down to four hours a day; water is available for only an hour a day in many areas. Unemployment is rising, the foreign debt has reached $4 billion, the 1989 trade deficit was $1 billion, up from $700 million the year before. Estimates of the number who have fled illegally to the U.S. range up to a million. Without the remittances of Dominicans working in Puerto Rico and on the U.S.  mainland -- illegally for the most part -- "the country could not survive," the London Economics reports.

<P>U.S. investors, assisted by Woodrow Wilson's invasion and its aftermath, later Johnson's, had long controlled most of the economy.  Now foreign investment in 17 free trade zones is attracted by 15-year tax holidays and average wages of 65 cents an hour. Some "remain upbeat about the Dominican Republic's situation," the Business Magazine of the Developing World (South) reports, citing U.S.  ambassador Paul Taylor, who described the new free trade zones as an economic miracle in a talk to the chamber of commerce. There are some objective grounds for Taylor's cheerful view of the prospects, South observes: "Optimists point to the political and labour harmony in the Dominican Republic, the substantial pool of cheap workers and the transport, banking and communications services as continuing strong incentives to investors. Indeed, as a Dominican factory manager notes: `Anyone who gets involved in unions here knows that they'll lose their job and won't work in the free trade zone any more.' "

<P>As in Brazil and elsewhere, the American Institute for Free Labor Development (AIFLD), the AFL-CIO foreign affairs arm supported by the government and major corporations, "has been instrumental in discouraging hostile [sic] union activity in order to help U.S. companies maximise their profits," South reports. With friends like these, Dominican workers have little to fear.

<P>A more recent beneficiary of U.S. invasion, Panama, also has its share of optimists, as discussed in the first part of this series, notably the tiny white minority now restored to power and the U.S.  businesspeople who have revived Panama City's night-life. As elsewhere in Latin America, the plight of the unimportant people is deplored by sections of the Church who persist in their old-fashioned "preferential option for the poor," not understanding the merits of the promising new "trickle down" techniques of raising them from their misery.

<P>Elsewhere in the Caribbean basin, we find much the same picture, including Grenada, also liberated by U.S. benevolence, then restored to its proper status (see my article in Z, March 1990). The U.S.  pursued a different path to ensure virtuous behavior in the case of Jamaica. Upstarts led by the social democrat Michael Manley and his People's National Party (PNP) sought to explore the forbidden path of independent development and social reform in the 1970s, eliciting the usual hostility from the United States and sufficient pressures to achieve an electoral victory for U.S. favorite Edward Seaga, who pledged to put an end to such nonsense. Seaga's pursuit of proper free market principles was lauded by the Reagan administration, which announced grandly that it would use this opportunity to create a showcase for democracy and capitalism in the Caribbean. Massive aid flowed. USAID spent more on Jamaica than on any other Caribbean program. The World Bank also joined in to oversee and expedite this estimable project. Seaga followed all the rules, introducing austerity measures, establishing Free Trade Zones where non-union labor, mostly women, work in sweatshops for miserable wages in foreign-run plants subsidized by the Jamaican government, and generally keeping to the IMF prescriptions.

<P>There was some economic growth, "mainly as a result of laundered `ganja' dollars from the marijuana trade, increased tourism earnings, lower fuel import costs, and higher prices for bauxite and alumina," the North American Congress on Latin America (NACLA) reports. The rest was the usual catastrophe of capitalism, including one of the highest per capita foreign debts in the world, collapse of infrastructure, and general impoverishment. According to USAID, by March 1988, along with its "crippling debt burden," Jamaica was a country where economic output was "far below the production level of 1972," "distribution of wealth and income is highly unequal," "shortages of key medical and technical personnel plague the health system," "physical decay and social violence deter investment," and there are "severe deficits in infrastructure and housing." The assessment was made six months before hurricane Gilbert dealt a further blow.

<P>At this point, Michael Manley, now properly tamed, was granted the right to return to power to administer the ruins, all hope for constructive change having been lost. Manley "is making all the right noises" to reassure the Bank and foreign investors, Roger Robinson, World Bank senior economist for Jamaica, said in a June 1988 pre-election interview. He explained further that "Five years ago, people were still thinking about `meeting local needs,' but not any more. Now the lawyers and others with access to resources are interested in external export investment. Once you have that ingrained in a population, you can't go back easily, even if the PNP and Michael Manley come in again. Now there's an understanding among individuals who save, invest, and develop their careers that capital will start leaving again if the PNP, or even [Seaga's] JLP, intervenes too much."

<P>Returned to office, Manley recognized the handwriting on the wall, outdoing Seaga as an enthusiast for free market capitalism. "The old gospel that government should be operated in the interests of the poor is being modified, even if not expressly rejected, by the dawning realization that the only way to help the poor is to operate the government in the interest of the productive!" the journal of the Private Sector of Jamaica exulted -- here the term "productive" does not refer to the people who produce, but to those who manage, control investment, and reap profits. The public sector is "on the verge of collapse," the Private Sector report continues, with schools, health care and other services rapidly declining. But with the "nonsensical rhetoric of the recent past" abandoned, and privatization of everything in sight on the way, there is hope -- for "the productive," in the special intended sense.

<P>Manley has won new respect from the important people now that he has learned to play the role of "violin president," in Latin American terminology: "put up by the left but played by the right." The conditions of capital flight and foreign pressures -- state, private, and international economic institutions -- have regularly sufficed to bar any other course.


<H3>The Fruits Of Victory: Asia</H3>

<P>Turning to Asia, a serious inquiry into the victory of freedom, capitalism, and democracy will naturally begin with the Philippines, which has benefited from U.S. solicitude for close to a century. The desperate state of Filipinos is reviewed in the Far Eastern Economic Review, firmly dedicated to economic liberalism and the priorities of the business community, under the heading "Power to the plutocrats."  Its reports conclude that "Much of the country's problems now...seem to be rooted in the fact that the country has had in its entire history no form of social revolution." The consequences of this failure include "the jinxed land reform programme," a failure that "profoundly affects the prognosis for the incidence of poverty" among the 67 percent of poor Filipino families living in rural areas, condemning them to permanent misery, huge foreign debt, "massive capital flight," an increase in severe malnutrition among pre-school children since the Aquino Government took power, widespread underemployment, and survival for many on incomes far below Government-defined poverty thresholds, "the growth of a virtual society of beggars and criminals," and the rest of the familiar story.  Government and academic experts expect things to get considerably worse. For the "rapidly expanding disadvantaged," the only way out is to seek work abroad: "legal and illegal workers from the Philippines now comprise the greatest annual labour exodus in Asia." With social programs abandoned, the only hope is if "the big-business elite, in a situation of little government interference, foregoes the Philippine elite traditional proclivity towards conspicuous consumption, and instead use profits both for their employees' welfare and to accumulate capital for industrial development."

<P>Their failure to do so can perhaps be explained by the fact that the United States has had so little time to exercise its tutelage; only 90 years, after all. That its ministrations might have something to do with what we find is a possibility not to be addressed.  In the real world, these desperate conditions can be traced in no small measure to the U.S. invasion at the turn of the century with its vast slaughter and destruction, the long colonial occupation, and the subsequent policies including the postwar counterinsurgency campaign and support for the Marcos dictatorship as long as it was viable. But the Philippines did gain the (intermittent) gift of democracy. In the same business journal, a columnist for the Manila Daily Globe, Conrado de Quiros, reflects on this matter under the heading "The wisdom of democracy." He compares the disaster of the Philippines to the economic success story of Singapore under Lee Kuan Yew, whose harsh tyranny is another of those famous triumphs of democracy and capitalism. De Quiros quotes the Singapore Minister of Trade and Industry, Lee's son, who condemns the U.S. model imposed on the Philippines for many flaws, the "worst crime" being that it granted the Filipinos a free press; in his own words, "An American-style free-wheeling press purveyed junk in the marketplace of ideas, which led to confusion and bewilderment, not to enlightenment and truth."  With a better appreciation of the merits of fascism, his Singapore government is too wise to fall into this error.

<P>The Americans did introduce a form of democracy, de Quiros continues.  However, it "was not designed to make Filipinos free but to make them comfortable with their new chains." It may have given the Filipinos more newspapers, but "it has given them less money with which to buy them. It has made the rich richer," with "one of the world's worst cases of inequity in the distribution of wealth," according to the World Bank. Democracy "was an instrument of colonisation," and was not intended to have substantive content: "For most Filipinos, American-style democracy meant little more than elections every few years. Beyond this, the colonial authorities made sure that only the candidates who represented colonial interests first and last won. This practice did not die with colonialism. The ensuing political order, which persisted long after independence, was one where a handful of families effectively and ruthlessly ruled a society riven by inequality. It was democratic in form, borrowing as many American practices as it could, but autocratic in practice.

<P>That these were indeed the policy goals is a rational conclusion in the light of historical practice and the documentary record. We may then describe the Philippines as another success story of democracy and capitalism, and number its people too among the victors in the Cold War.

<P>Under Philippine democracy, most of the population is not represented.  The politicians are lawyers or wealthy businessmen or landowners. As the political structure bequeathed to the Philippines by the American occupation was reconstituted after the overthrow of the U.S.-backed dictator by "people power," Gary Hawes writes in the scholarly journal Pacific Affairs, "it is only those with money and muscle who can be elected." Candidates are mainly "former elected officials, relatives of powerful political families and/or members of the economic elite," unrepresentative of the rural majority or even "the citizens who had demonstrated to bring down Marcos and who had risked their lives to protect their ballots for Corazon Aquino." There was a party (PnB) based on the popular organizations that arose against the dictatorship, with broad support from the peasantry, the labor force, and large reformist sections of the middle class, but it was to have no political role. In the elections, PnB was outspent by the traditional conservative parties by a ratio of up to 20 to 1. Its supporters were subjected to intimidation and threats of loss of jobs, housing, and city licenses. The military presence also served to inhibit PnB campaigning. Interviews with poor farmers and workers revealed a preference for PnB candidates, but a recognition that since the military and the rural elite opposed them, "the next best choice was to take the money or the rewards and vote for the candidates endorsed by the Aquino government.

<P>The playing field having been properly levelled, our celebrated "yearning for democracy" is satisfied.

<P>Under the reconstituted elite democracy, Hawes continues, "the voices of the rural dwellers" -- almost two-thirds of the population -- "have seldom been heard," and the same is true of the urban poor. The cure for agitation in the countryside is militarization and the rise of vigilantes, leading to a record of human rights violations "as bad as, if not worse than, during the time of Marcos," a 1988 human rights mission reported, with torture, summary executions, and forced evacuations. There is economic growth, but its fruits "have seldom trickled down to the most needy." Peasants continue to starve while paying 70 percent of their crop to the landlord. Agrarian reform is barely a joke. Support for the National Democratic Front (NDF) and its guerrillas is mounting after years of rural organizing.

<P>De Quiros suggests that there has been "substantive democracy in the Philippines -- despite colonialism and elite politics." "This is so because democracy took a life of its own, expressing itself in peasant revolts and popular demand for reforms." It is just this substantive democracy that the United States and its allies are dedicated to repress and contain. Hence the absence of any social revolution of the kind that he and several other commentators in this most respectable business journal see as sorely lacking in the Philippines -- though if it can join the club of "capitalist democracies" of the Singapore variety, the tune will likely change.

<P>Meanwhile, Survival International reports that tribal peoples are being attacked by the private army of a logging company, which, in a six month campaign of terror, has killed and tortured villagers, burned down houses, destroyed rice stores, and driven thousands from their homes. The same tribal people are among the many victims of bombing of villages and other practices of the government counterinsurgency campaigns. Appeals to the Aquino government have been ignored. An appeal to the U.S. government, or Western circles generally, cannot be seriously proposed. The same is true in Thailand, where the government announced a plan to expel six million people from forests where it wants to establish softwood plantations.

<P>Miracles of capitalism are also to be found elsewhere in Asia. Charles Gray, responsible for Asian affairs in the pro-business AFL-CIO foreign affairs branch (AIFLD), observes in the Far Eastern Economic Review that transnational corporations "generally insist the host government suppress the right of workers to organise and join unions, even when that right is guaranteed in the country's own constitution and laws." The organization that coordinates trade in the Free World (GATT) does not have a single rule that "covers the subsidies that transnational corporations get though pressures on Third World governments to permit 19th century-type exploitation of labour." In Malaysia, "U.S. and other foreign corporations forced the Labour Ministry in 1988 to continue the government's long-standing prohibition of unions in the electronics industry by threatening to shift their jobs and investments to another country." In Bangladesh, contractors for the transnationals "discriminate against women and girls by paying them starvation wages as low as 9 U.S. cents an hour." In China's Guangdong province, when the government found that "the factory of a leading toy manufacturer was engaged in labour law violations -- such as 14-hour workdays and 7-day workweeks -- it approached the managers to ask them to respect the law. The managers refused, and said that if they were unable to operate the way they wanted they would close their Chinese factories and move to Thailand," where there are no such unreasonable demands.

<P>Low prices for imported toys have doubtless brought much Christmas cheer in the industrial West.


<H3>The Fruits Of Victory: Africa</H3>

<P>The scene in Africa is worse still. To mention only one small element of a growing catastrophe, a study of the U.N. Economic Commission for Africa estimates that "South Africa's military aggression and destabilization of its neighbors cost the region $10 billion in 1988 and over $60 billion and <I>1.5 million lives in the first nine years of this decade.</I>" Such figures are considered too insignificant to merit notice in the Newspaper of Record, which avoided the matter. Congress imposed sanctions on South Africa in 1986 over Reagan's veto, but their impact has been limited. The American Committee on Africa reports that only 25 percent of U.S.-South African trade has been affected, and that iron, steel, and (until late 1989) half-finished uranium continued to be imported. After the sanctions were put in place, U.S. exports to South Africa increased from $1.28 billion in 1987 to $1.71 billion in 1989, according to the U.S. Commerce Department.

<P>While the South African government and the minority White groups it represents face mounting problems, they may see some rays of hope as well. New diplomatic ties between South Africa and Hungary, now that it has achieved independence, may prove to be "the wedge that breaks trade sanctions and the international isolation of the South African government," the Christian Science Monitor reports in a lead story, citing an economist at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences who foresees expanding trade between South Africa and Eastern Europe.

<P>The economic catastrophe of much of Africa is commonly attributed to "socialism," a term used freely to apply to anything we are not supposed to like. But there is an exception, "an island of freewheeling capitalism in a sea of one-party socialist states," Africa correspondent Howard Witt of the conservative Chicago Tribune writes. He is referring to Liberia, which, like the Philippines, can attribute its happy state to the fact that it was "America's only toehold on the African continent" -- for a century and a half, in this case. Liberia took on special significance during the Cold War years, Witt continues, particularly after President Samuel Doe, a "brutish, nearly illiterate army sergeant...seized power in 1980 after disemboweling the previous president in his bed" (more recently suffering a similar fate himself), and proceeded to elevate his fellow tribesmen -- 4 percent of the population -- into a new ruling elite, and to persecute and savagely oppress the rest of the population. The Reagan administration, much impressed, determined to turn Liberia, like Jamaica, into a showcase of capitalism and democracy. In the first six years of Doe's regime, the U.S. poured military and economic aid into "the backward country," "even as evidence mounted that Doe and his ministers were stealing much of the money, and after he "brazenly stole" the 1985 election with Washington's approval, in a replay of the Noriega story a year earlier. A "respected expatriate Liberian dissident and former government minister," Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, says: "At the time, an American official told me bluntly, `Our strategic interests are more important than democracy'."

<P>The results of the aid are evident, Witt writes: "The soldiers of President Samuel Doe's army wear the uniforms of American GIs as they go about their business murdering Liberian civilians on the streets of the capital, Monrovia," named after President Monroe, and "the bodies of many of the civilian victims are dumped in the morgue at the American-built John F. Kennedy Hospital," where "combat-hardened doctors" say "they have never witnessed such brutality." Monrovia is a death trap, Witt writes. Those who are not struck down by starvation, cholera, or typhoid try to escape the army or the rebel forces under Charles Taylor, a former Doe aide -- or later, those under the command of a breakaway unit led by Prince Johnson.

<P>The results of the U.S. aid became even clearer when reporters entered Monrovia with the African peacekeeping force after Doe was tortured and murdered by Johnson's guerrillas. They found "a bloody legacy" of the "10 years in power" of the U.S. favorite, UPI reporter Mark Huband writes: piles of bleached bones and skulls, many smashed; "half-clothed, decomposed heaps of flesh...littered with millions of maggots"; "contorted bodies...huddled beneath church pews" and "piled up in a dark corner beside the altar"; bodies "rotting into their mattresses"; "a large meeting hall for women and children [where] clothes clung to the skeletons of female and underaged victims."

<P>Not everyone, of course, has suffered in this "island of freewheeling capitalism." For a century and a half, the oligarchy of freed American slaves and their descendants "oppressed and exploited the indigenous population," while "the U.S. looked the other way." And lately, the Reagan favorites did quite well for themselves until their turn came to be dispatched. Others merely benefited, escaping any such unpleasant fate: "U.S. corporations like Firestone and B.F. Goodrich made healthy profits from the expansive Liberian operations," Witt observes, proving that freewheeling capitalism has its virtues. The U.S. built a huge Voice of America transmitter in Liberia, perhaps to broadcast the happy message of what can be achieved under capitalist democracy. We can chalk up another victory for the Free World.

<P>Current U.S. policy, Johnson-Sirleaf says, is "a lack of policy."  "It's kind of, `Oh, those Africans are at it again. Let them fight, and may the best man win'." To judge by the commentary on all of this, there is nothing here to teach us anything about ourselves, our legendary benevolence, or the marvels of freewheeling capitalism.

<P>Behind the "lack of policy," there is, however, the usual policy toward the Third World, which we can trace back as usual to the early postwar period when the global order was being shaped in the interests of the rich and powerful in the West. Like other parts of the Third World, Africa had its "function." It was to be "exploited" for the reconstruction of Europe, George Kennan explained in a major State Department study on the international order. He added that the opportunity to exploit Africa should provide a psychological lift for the European powers, affording them "that tangible objective for which everyone has been rather unsuccessfully groping...." History might have suggested a different project: that Africa should "exploit" Europe to enable it to reconstruct from centuries of devastation at the hands of European conquerors, perhaps also improving its psychological state through this process. Needless to say, nothing of the sort was remotely thinkable, and the actual proposals have received little notice, apparently being regarded as uncontroversial.

<P>In discussion of African policy particularly, the element of racism cannot be discounted. Dean Acheson warned the former Prime Minister of the racist government of Rhodesia in 1971 to beware of the "American public," who "decide that the only correct decision of any issue must be one which favors the colored point of view." He urged that Rhodesia not "get led down the garden path by any of our constitutional cliches -- equal protection of the laws, etc. -- which have caused us so much trouble...." This venerated figure of American liberalism was particularly disturbed by the Supreme Court's use of "vague constitutional provisions" which "hastened racial equality and has invaded the political field by the one-man-one-vote doctrine," which made "Negroes...impatient for still more rapid progress and led to the newly popular techniques of demonstration and violence" (September 1968). The "pall of racism...hovering over" African affairs under the Nixon administration, "and over the most basic public issues foreign and domestic," has been discussed by State Department official Roger Morris, including Nixon's request to Kissinger to assure that his first presidential message to Congress on foreign policy have "something in it for the jigs" (eliciting "the usual respectful `Yes'" from this abject flunkey); Kissinger's disbelief that the Ibos, "more gifted and accomplished" than other Nigerians, could also be "more Negroid"; and Alexander Haig's "quietly pretend[ing] to beat drums on the table as African affairs were brought up at NSC staff meetings.


<H3>The "Unrelenting Nightmare"</H3>

<P>The World Health Organization estimates that 11 million children die every year in the world of the Cold War victors ("the developing world") because of the unwillingness of the rich to help them. The catastrophe could be brought to a quick end, the WHO study concludes, because the diseases from which the children suffer and die are easily treated. Four million die from diarrhea; about two-thirds of them could be saved from the lethal dehydration it causes by sugar and salt tablets that cost a few pennies. Three million die each year from infectious diseases that could be overcome by vaccination, at a cost of about $10 a head. Reporting in the London Observer on this "virtually unnoticed" study, Annabel Ferriman quotes WHO director-general Hiroshi Nakajima, who observes that this "silent genocide" is "a preventable tragedy because the developed world has the resources and technology to end common diseases worldwide," but lacks "the will to help the developing countries."

<P>The basic story was summarized succinctly by President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda, chairman of the Organization of African Unity. Speaking at the UN conference of the world's 41 least-developed countries, he called the 1980s "an unrelenting nightmare" for the poorest countries.  There was a plea to the industrial powers to more than double their aid to a munificent 2/10 of 1 percent of their GNP, but no agreement was reached, the New York Times reports "principally because of opposition from the United States."

<P>As capitalism and freedom won their Grand Victory, the World Bank reported that the share of the world's wealth controlled by poor and medium-income countries declined from 23 percent to 18 percent (1980 to 1988). The Bank's 1990 report adds that in 1989, resources transferred from the "developing countries" to the industrialized world reached a new record. Debt service payments are estimated to have exceeded new flows of funds by $42.9 billion, an increase of $5 billion from 1988, and new funds from the wealthy fell to the lowest level in the decade.

<P>These are some of the joys of capitalism that are somehow missing in the flood of self-praise and the encomia to the wonders of our system -- of which all of this is a noteworthy component -- as we celebrate its triumph. The media and journals are inundated with laments (with an admixture of barely concealed glee) over the sad state of the Soviet Union and its domains, where even a salary of $100 a month enjoyed by the luckier workers is "scandalously high by the niggardly standards of Communism." One will have to search far, however, for a look at the scene nearer to home, or for derisive commentary on "the niggardly standards of capitalism" and the suffering endured by the huge mass of humanity who have been cast aside by the dominant powers, long the richest and most favored societies of the world, and not without a share of responsibility for the circumstances of most of the others, all too easy to ignore.

<P>The missing view also unveils a possible future that may await much of Eastern Europe, which has endured many horrors, but is still regarded with envy in large parts of the Third World domains of the West that had comparable levels of development in the past, and are no less well endowed with resources and the material conditions for satisfying human needs. "Why have the leaders, the media, the citizens of the Great Western Democracies cared long and ardently for the people of Central Europe, but cared nothing for the people of Central America?"  the experienced correspondent Martha Gellhorn asks: "Most of them are bone poor, and most of them do not have white skin. Their lives and their deaths have not touched the conscience of the world. I can testify that it was far better and safer to be a peasant in communist Poland than it is to be a peasant in capitalist El Salvador."

<P>Her question is, unfortunately, all too easy to answer. It has been demonstrated beyond any lingering doubt that what sears the sensitive soul is the crimes of the enemy, not our own, for reasons that are all too obvious and much too uncomfortable to face. The comparison that Gellhorn draws is scarcely to be found in Western commentary, let alone the reasons for it.

<P>As in Latin America, some sectors of Eastern European society should come to share the economic and cultural standards of privileged classes in the rich industrial world that they see across their borders, much of the former Communist Party bureaucracy probably among them. Many others might look to the second Brazil, and its counterparts elsewhere, for a glimpse of a different future, which may come to pass if matters proceed on their present course.

<H1>Part III</H1>
<CITE>Z Magazine,</CITE> April 1991
</CENTER>


<P>In the first two segments of this series, I raised the question that at once comes to mind amidst the cheers for the glorious victory of the West in the Cold War: how are the victors faring at the moment of their triumph? A survey of the domains of the state capitalist industrial societies provides a stark answer: we find an "unrelenting nightmare," in the accurate words of those who have enjoyed the kind tutelage of the West. The catastrophe of capitalism could not be more vivid and dramatic.

<P>Notice that the question raised is precisely the right one. One will learn next to nothing from a comparison of Eastern and Western Europe. In contrast, it is quite reasonable to compare regions that were more or less similar in relevant respects 80 years ago, but have since followed a different course: subjugation to Leninist-Stalinist tyranny and its aftermath (the USSR and Eastern Europe), or domination by the state capitalist democracies (the conventional Third World).

<P>Neither of these regions is homogeneous, and their prior histories differ as well. But to a first approximation, it is reasonable to describe large parts of both regions, before World War I, as roughly comparable in social and economic development, and relation to the West. At the time, Russia was developing, though it was far more backward than Western Europe and not closing the gap, and by 1914, "becoming a semi-colonial possession of European capital," historian Teodor Shanin observes. Making a similar point, economic historian Alexander Gerschenkron notes that "in 1913, that is, thirty-five years after Bulgaria's liberation, nearly 80 percent of all the plows used in Bulgarian farming were most primitive wooden implements," and in the 1930s, "wooden plows were still more numerous than the iron ones." Similar observations hold generally, so it appears, though comparative studies seem to be few.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.1" HREF="#FN3.1">1</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>It is therefore of some interest to ask how Guatemalan peasants or Brazilian slum dwellers would react, were they to find themselves suddenly transported to Poland or Bulgaria or the Ukraine. We learn a good deal about ourselves by pursuing the inquiry, and also by observing how the obvious questions are stifled and eliminated in the chorus of self-adulation.


<H3>Some Unheard Voices</H3>

<P>The victims, of course, do not join the chorus, but as always, their voices remain unheard. Thus, there is much pretense of concern over the murder of the Jesuit intellectuals in El Salvador, but it does not reach as far as attending to anything they say on any topic, including this one, even though -- or rather because -- one might learn a good deal from the exercise. On the question at hand, the journal <CITE>Proceso</CITE> of the Jesuit University UCA in San Salvador, where the priests were assassinated, has this to say:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The so-called Salvadoran `democratic process' could learn a lot from the capacity for self-criticism that the socialist nations are demonstrating. If Lech Walesa had been doing his organizing work in El Salvador, he would have already entered into the ranks of the disappeared -- at the hands of `heavily armed men dressed in civilian clothes'; or have been blown to pieces in a dynamite attack on his union headquarters. If Alexander Dubcek were a politician in our country, he would have been assassinated like He'ctor Oquel!  [the social democratic leader assassinated in Guatemala, by Salvadoran death squads, according to the Guatemalan government]. If Andrei Sakharov had worked here in favor of human rights, he would have met the same fate as Herbert Anaya [one of the many murdered leaders of the independent Salvadoran Human Rights Commission CDHES]. If Ota-Sik or Vaclav Havel had been carrying out their intellectual work in El Salvador, they would have woken up one sinister morning, lying on the patio of a university campus with their heads destroyed by the bullets of an elite army battalion.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.2" HREF="#FN3.2">2</A></FONT></SUP>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The comparison between the Soviet and U.S. satellites is so dramatic that it takes real dedication not to perceive it, and outside of Western intellectual circles, it is a commonplace. A writer in the Mexico's leading daily comments on the "striking contrast" between Soviet behavior toward its satellites and "U.S.  policy in the Western Hemisphere, where intransigence, interventionism and the application of typical police state instruments have traditionally marked Washington's actions": "In Europe, the USSR and Gorbachev are associated with the struggle for freedom of travel, political rights, and respect for public opinion. In the Americas, the U.S. and Bush are associated with indiscriminate bombings of civilians, the organization, training and financing of death squads, and programs of mass murder" -- not quite the story in New York and Washington, where the United States is hailed as an "inspiration for the triumph of democracy in our time" (<CITE>New Republic</CITE>).<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.3" HREF="#FN3.3">3</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>A prominent Latin American theologian, Pablo Richard, also fails to see matters as he is informed he does by the <CITE>New Republic</CITE> commissars. Richard is professor of theology at the National University of Costa Rica and a leading figure in the formation of the base Christian communities, a prime target of the U.S.-backed savagery of the Reagan-Bush years (enthusiastically supported by the <CITE>New Republic</CITE> and others who now bask in their inspiring triumph) because they sought to organize the poor, threatening to bring democracy and social reform, the ultimate crime. Richard compares the current situation of the Third World to that of the early Christians under the Roman Empire, which Christians saw as "the Beast, a murderous idolatrous Beast," who could not be confronted with force, because it is far too powerful and violent, but must be confronted ethically and spiritually: "This new way of confronting imperialism in the decade of the `90s, which emphasizes cultural, ethical, spiritual, and theological confrontation, challenges in a special way the [Christian base communities] and the Church of the Poor," Richard writes.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.4" HREF="#FN3.4">4</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Others use different terms to express similar perceptions. The essential points, again, are a commonplace outside of disciplined Western circles, mired in ideological fanaticism and blind to the elementary (but unacceptable) realities of the world.


<H3>Latin America and the Soviet Bloc</H3>

<P>The social, economic, and ecological catastrophes resulting from traditional Western imperialism and its more recent variants go a long way towards explaining the reluctance of many in the Third World to join the celebration of victory, and their tendency to regard the victims of Soviet tyranny with a degree of envy. Furthermore, the state terror faced on a daily basis by Latin Americans who dare to raise their heads has been qualitatively different from the repression in Eastern Europe in the post-Stalin period, terrible as that was in its own ways; and they do not share our reluctance to see the powerful and systematic influence of Washington and U.S. corporations in establishing and maintaining the grim conditions of their lives.

<P>Another comparison that might be addressed is suggested by the huge flow of capital from the Third World to the United States and the West generally. Latin America alone transferred some $150 billion to the industrial West from 1982 to 1987 in addition to $100 billion of capital flight, a capital transfer amounting to 25 times the total value of the Alliance for Progress and 15 times the Marshall Plan, according to Latin Americanist Robert Pastor, director of Latin American and Caribbean Affairs for the National Security Council under the Carter administration. The Bank for International Settlements in Switzerland estimates that between 1978 and 1987, some $170 billion in flight capital left Latin America, not including money hidden by falsified trade transactions. The <CITE>New York Times</CITE> cites another estimate that anonymous capital flows, including drug money and flight capital, total $600 billion to $800 billion. This huge hemorrhage is part of a complicated system whereby Western banks and Latin American elites enrich themselves at the expense of the general population of Latin America, saddled with the "debt crisis" that results from these manipulations, and taxpayers in the Western countries who are ultimately called upon to foot part of the bill.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.5" HREF="#FN3.5">5</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Again, the situation in the Soviet satellites is different. One commentator on their affairs, Lawrence Weschler, observes that

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Poles, like most Eastern Europeans, have long lived under the delusion that the Soviets were simply bleeding them dry; in fact, the situation has been considerably more complex than that. (The Soviet dominion was in fact that unique historical perversity, an empire in which the center bled <I>itself</I> for the sake of its colonies, or rather, for the sake of tranquility in those colonies. Muscovites always lived poorer lives than Varsovians.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Throughout the region, journalists and others report, shops are better stocked than in the Soviet Union and material conditions are often better. It is widely agreed that "Eastern Europe has a higher standard of living than the USSR," and that while "Latin-Americans claim mainly economic exploitation," "Soviet exploitation of Eastern Europe is principally political and security-oriented" (Jan Triska, summarizing the conclusions of a Stanford University symposium on the USSR in Eastern Europe and the U.S. in Latin America).<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.6" HREF="#FN3.6">6</A></FONT></SUP> In the decade of the 1970s, according to U.S. government sources, the Soviet Union provided an $80 billion subsidy to its Eastern European satellites (while their indebtedness to the West increased from $9.3 billion in 1971 to $68.7 billion in 1979). A study done at the Institute of International Studies of the University of California (Berkeley) estimated the subsidy at $106 billion from 1974 to 1984. Using different criteria, another academic study by Paul Marer and Kazimierz Poznanski reaches the estimate of $40 billion for the same period, omitting factors that might add several billion, they note. When Lithuania was faced with Soviet economic retaliation after its declaration of independence, the <CITE>Wall Street Journal</CITE> reported that the Soviet subsidy to that country alone might approach $6 billion annually.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.7" HREF="#FN3.7">7</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Such comparisons cannot simply be taken at face value; complex issues arise, and they have never been properly addressed. The only extensive scholarly study attempting to compare the U.S. impact on Latin America with that of the USSR on Eastern Europe, to my knowledge, is the Stanford symposium just cited, but it does not reach very far. Among many striking gaps, the contributors entirely disregard repression and state terror in Latin America and the U.S. role in implementing it. Writing in May 1986, the editor states that "some left-wing forces in Latin America and all dissidents in Eastern Europe have little hope of bringing about substantive changes, either peacefully or through violence." One contributor even takes seriously (though rejecting) the absurd statement by Mexican writer (now Nobel Laureate) Octavio Paz in 1985 that it is "monstrous" even to raise the question of comparing U.S. policies with those of the Soviet Union. Most take it as obvious, hence needing no real evidence, that U.S. influence has been disinterested and benign. In fact, this 470 page study contains very little information altogether.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.8" HREF="#FN3.8">8</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Many questions would arise if such comparisons were to be undertaken in a meaningful way. Contrary to standard conventions (generally followed in the Stanford symposium), it is hardly plausible to regard U.S. security concerns in Latin America as comparable to those of the Soviet Union in Eastern Europe, or even to take seriously the conventional doctrine that security concerns are "probably the greatest factor in shaping U.S. policy toward Latin America" (Robert Wesson, presenting the "historical overview and analysis" for the Stanford symposium). In recent memory, the United States has not been repeatedly invaded and virtually destroyed by powerful enemies marching through Central America. In fact, its authentic security concerns are virtually nil, by international and historical standards. There are what are called "security concerns," but as one participant in the symposium finally concedes, after having taken them quite seriously, "U.S. national security interests in the Caribbean [as elsewhere in the hemisphere, we may add] have rested on powerful economic investments" (Jiri Valenta) -- which is to say that they are termed "security interests" only for purposes of the delusional system. Furthermore, it makes little sense to attribute to the United States greater tolerance for "political-ideological deviations" on the grounds that it does not insist on "the U.S. brand of democracy" and tolerates "authoritarian dictatorships," while the USSR insists on Leninist regimes (Valenta). What the U.S. demands is an economic order geared to its interests; the political form it takes is largely an irrelevance.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.9" HREF="#FN3.9">9</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Unless freed from the extreme ideological constraints of conventional scholarship, comparative study is bound to be largely worthless.

<P>The matter of capital flow is also complex. In the first place, the regional hegemons are not remotely comparable in wealth and economic level, and never have been, so that their role in economic transactions will differ greatly. For another, investment has intricate effects. It can lead to economic growth, benefit certain sectors of the population while severely harming others, lay the basis for independent development or undermine such prospects. The numbers in themselves tell only a small part of the story, and have to be complemented by the kind of analysis that has yet to be undertaken in comparing Eastern Europe and Latin America.

<P>It should be evident without further comment that the standard comparison of Eastern to Western Europe, or the Soviet Union to the United States, is virtually meaningless, designed for propaganda, not enlightenment.


<H3>Latin America and the NICs</H3>

<P>Other subordinate and dependent systems have yet a different character. Discussing the rapid economic growth of South Korea and Taiwan after the powerful stimulus given by Vietnam war spending, Bruce Cumings observes that it resumes a process of development begun under Japanese colonialism. Unlike the West, he notes, Japan brought industry to the labor and raw materials rather than vice versa, leading to industrial development under state-corporate guidance, now renewed. Japan's colonial policies were extremely brutal, but they laid a basis for economic development. Needless to say, these economic successes, like those of Singapore and Hong Kong, are no tribute either to democracy or the wonders of the market; rather, to harsh labor conditions, efficient quasi-fascist political systems, and, much as in Japan, high levels of protectionism and planning by financial-industrial conglomerates in a state-coordinated economy.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.10" HREF="#FN3.10">10</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Comparison of the Pacific colonies of the U.S. and Japan is not common here, but right-wing Japanese are not reluctant to pursue it. Shintaro Ishihara, a powerful figure in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, which holds a virtual monopoly of political power, observes that the countries that were once under Japanese administration are "success stories" from the economic point of view, while the Philippines are an economic disaster and the "showcase of democracy" is largely empty form. "Philippine landowners have accumulated incredible power and wealth, siphoning everything from the ordinary people," while "tradition is dismantled" in favor of a shallow and superficial veneer of American culture, "an atrocity -- a barbaric act."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.11" HREF="#FN3.11">11</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>This spokesman for right-wing nationalism is plainly not a trustworthy independent source. But there is more than a little truth to what he says.

<P>Comparison of the Latin American economies with those of East Asia (the "Newly Industrializing Countries," NICs) is another topic that has rarely been undertaken seriously. Editorials, news reporting, and other commentary commonly allege that the comparison reveals the superiority of economic liberalism, but without providing the basis for that conclusion. It is not easy to sustain, if only because of the radical departures from liberal capitalism in the success stories of Asia. As Alice Amsden in particular has emphasized, the highly touted economic successes of East Asia can be traced in no small measure to the fact that the state is not only powerful enough to discipline labor, as is the norm, but even to discipline <I>capital,</I> and to compel sharp departures from market principles for the sake of economic development. More generally, it is virtually the conventional wisdom (and well supported) that "late developing countries" typically rely on extensive state intervention and coordination. In fact, it is hard to find any exception, late or early. If the U.S. had kept to the principles it now imposes on the "developing world," we would probably still be pursuing our comparative advantage in producing furs, and it is hardly likely that we would ever have had, say, a steel industry. The same continues to be true of advanced industrial societies, including the United States, where the parts of the economy that remain competitive benefit from huge taxpayer subsidies and a state-guaranteed market (high tech industry via the Pentagon system being the most striking case). In Germany, to mention only one feature, the IMF estimates that industrial incentives are the equivalent of a 30 percent tariff. IMF conditions and the like are fine for weaker economies that we intend to exploit.  The conditions greatly facilitate the robbery of the poor.  Beyond that, their merits are less than obvious.

<P>The comparison between Latin America and East Asia was addressed at a conference on global macroeconomics in Helsinki in 1986.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.12" HREF="#FN3.12">12</A></FONT></SUP> Several contributors observe that the situation is complex, and conclude that the disparities that developed in the 1980s (though not before) are attributable to a variety of factors, among them, the harmful effects of greater openness to international capital markets in large parts of Latin America (as in the Philippines), which permitted vast capital flight, but not in the East Asian economies with their more rigid controls by government and central banks. In South Korea, for example, export of capital can carry the death penalty. Again, the standard story seems to be virtually the opposite of the truth.


<H3>Comparisons and their Pitfalls</H3>

<P>The complexity of the issues that arise is shown in a revealing study of Indian development, in comparison to China and others, by Harvard economist Amartya Sen. He observes that "a comparative study of the experiences of different countries in the world shows quite clearly that countries tend to reap as they sow in the field of investment in health and quality of life." India followed very different policies from China in this regard. Beginning at a comparable level in the late 1940s, India has added about 15 years to added life expectancy, while China added 10 or 15 years beyond that increase, approaching the standards of Europe. The reasons lie in social policy, primarily, the much greater focus on improving nutrition and health conditions for the general population in China, and providing widespread medical coverage. The same was true, Sen argues, in Sri Lanka and probably Vietnam, and in earlier years in Europe as well, where, for example, life expectancy rose rapidly in England and Wales after large-scale public intervention in the distribution of food and health care and expansion of public employment.

<P>But this is not the whole story. In the late 1950s, life expectancy in China plunged for several years to far below that of India because of a huge famine, which took an estimated 30 million lives. Sen attributes the famine to the nature of the Chinese regime, which did not react for three years, and may not even have been aware of the scale of the famine because the totalitarian conditions blocked information flow. Nothing similar has happened in India with its pluralist democracy. Nevertheless, Sen calculates, if China's lower mortality rates prevailed in India, there would have been close to 4 million fewer deaths a year in the mid-1980s. "This indicates that every eight years or so more people in addition die in India -- in comparison with Chinese mortality rates -- than the total number that died in the gigantic Chinese famine," the worst in the world in this century.

<P>In further confirmation of his thesis, Sen observes that life expectancy in China has suffered a slow decline since 1979, when the new market-oriented reforms were undertaken. Another relevant example is the Indian state of Kerala, long under leftist rule and with "a long history of extensive public support in education, health care, and food distribution." Here, improvement in life expectancy is comparable to China, though it is one of India's poorer states.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.13" HREF="#FN3.13">13</A></FONT></SUP>


<H3>Human Values</H3>

<P>These are all serious and difficult questions, with far-reaching human consequences. The development strategies imposed upon the Third World by Western power, implemented by the international economic institutions or the states and corporations themselves, have enormous effects on the lives of the targeted populations. The record shows plainly enough that the policies that are advocated or enforced by the Western powers, and the confident rhetoric that accompanies them in official pronouncements and other commentary, are guided by the self-interest of those who hold the reins, not by any solid understanding of the economics of development, or any serious concern for the human impact of these decisions. Benefits that may accrue to others are largely incidental, as are the catastrophes that commonly ensue.

<P>As the collapsing Soviet system resumes traditional quasi-colonial relations with the West, it is coming to be subjected to the same prescriptions -- in part by choice, given the intellectual vacuity that is one of the consequences of decades of totalitarian rule. But imposition of Third World norms is bound to meet resistance. One Polish critic writes that if the popular Chicago School

<BLOCKQUOTE>
words become flesh, this government would be the first in the history of the world to adhere firmly to this doctrine. All developed countries, including those (such as the Federal Republic of Germany) whose governments pay obeisance to the liberal doctrine, apply a wide spectrum of government interventions, such as in resource allocation, in investments, in developing technology, income distribution, pricing, export and import.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.14" HREF="#FN3.14">14</A></FONT></SUP>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>If resistance follows the path often taken in the Third World, it is likely to elicit the classic response.

<P>On a visit to Europe a few days before he was assassinated by elite government forces in San Salvador in November 1989, Father Ignacio Ellacuria, rector of the University of Central America, addressed the West on the underlying issues. You "have organized your lives around inhuman values," he said. These values

<BLOCKQUOTE>
are inhuman because they cannot be universalized. The system rests on a few using the majority of the resources, while the majority can't even cover their basic necessities. It is crucial to define a system of values and a norm of living that takes into account every human being.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.15" HREF="#FN3.15">15</A></FONT></SUP>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>In our dependencies, such thoughts are subversive and can call forth the death squads. At home, they are sometimes piously voiced, then relegated to the ashcan in practice. Perhaps the last words of the murdered priests deserve a better fate.

<H1>The Decline of the Democratic Ideal</H1>

<P>Noam Chomsky<BR>
March 1990<BR>
<CITE>Z Magazine,</CITE> May 1990

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Note: <A HREF="../dd/dd-c10-s01.html">Chapter 10</A> of <CITE><A HREF="../dd/dd.html">Deterring Democracy</A></CITE> is based in part on this essay.</FONT>
</CENTER>


<P>One fundamental goal of any well-conceived indoctrination program is to direct attention elsewhere, away from effective power, its roots, and the disguises it assumes. Thus to enter into debate over Vietnam, or the Middle East, or Central America, one is required to gain special knowledge of these areas while avoiding scrutiny of the United States. Rational standards are permitted for the study of Soviet intervention, which focusses on Moscow, not Kabul and Prague; for us, however, the problems lie elsewhere, not here. Respectable commentators can even speak of "the tragic self-destruction of Central America," with the two superpowers playing a (symmetrical) background role (Theodore Sorenson). A similar comment about Eastern Europe would merely arouse ridicule.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1" HREF="#FN1">1</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The serviceability of the doctrine is apparent. Those who hope to understand world affairs will naturally resist it. The February elections in Nicaragua are a case in point. The forces at work within Nicaragua are surely worth understanding, the reactions to the elections here no less so -- far more so, in fact, in terms of global import and long-term significance, given the scale and character of U.S. power. These reactions provide quite illuminating insight into the dominant political culture. They provide further and quite dramatic evidence that the concept of democracy is disappearing even as an abstract ideal.


<H3>The Winner: George Bush</H3>

<P>As a point of departure, consider a few reactions beyond the borders. In Mexico City, the liberal <CITE>La Jornada</CITE> wrote: "After 10 years, Washington examines with satisfaction the balance of an investment made with fire and blood..., an undeclared war of aggression... The elections were certainly cleanly prepared and conducted, but a decade of horror was behind them."

<P>While welcoming the electoral outcome, the right-wing daily <CITE>El Universal</CITE> acknowledged that "The defeated Sandinista Front does not have all of the responsibility for the disasters that have fallen upon Nicaraguans. Its lead role in the construction of Nicaragua in recent years cannot be denied, either. But the voters have made an objective use of the essential prerogative of democracy: to vote for who they believe can better their situation," surely George Bush's candidate, in the light of invariant U.S. policies that are as familiar to Latin Americans as the rising of the sun. For the independent <CITE>El Tiempo</CITE> in Colombia, passionately opposed to "frightening communism" and the Sandinistas who represent it on the continent, "The U.S. and President Bush scored a clear victory."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2" HREF="#FN2">2</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>In Guatemala, the independent <CITE>Central America Report</CITE> (Inforpress Centroamericana) concluded that "Most analysts agree that the UNO victory marks the consummation of the US government's military, economic and political efforts to overthrow the Sandinistas." Under the heading <CITE>The Winners,</CITE> the journal added:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
US President George Bush emerged as a clear victor in the Nicaraguan elections. The decade-long Reagan/Bush war against Nicaragua employed a myriad of methods -- both covert and open -- aimed at overthrowing the Sandinistas. Bush's continuation of the two-pronged Reagan policy of economic strangulation and military aggression finally reaped tangible results. Following the elections, Ortega said that the outcome was not in retrospect surprising since the voters went to the polls "with a pistol pointed at their heads"
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> -- a conclusion that the journal accepts without comment. "The consensus attributes the population's defection...to the critical economic crisis in Nicaragua," the report continues, citing an editorial in the Guatemala City press that "pointed out that more than ten years of economic and military aggressions waged by a government with unlimited resources created the setting for an election determined by economic exhaustion." "It was a vote in search of peace by a people that, inevitably, were fed up with violence," the Guatemala City editorial concluded: "It is a vote from a hungry people that, more than any idea, need to eat."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3" HREF="#FN3">3</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The analysis ends with this comment:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
"While many observers today are remarking that never before has a leftist revolutionary regime handed over power in elections, the opposite is also true. Never has a popular elected leftist government in Latin America been allowed to undertake its reforms without being cut short by a coup, an invasion or an assassination"
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> -- or, we may add, subversion, terror, or economic strangulation.

<P>Readers in Guatemala, or elsewhere in Latin America, need no further reminders of this truism. One will search far for any hint of such a thought, let alone a discussion of what it implies, in U.S. commentary. Even the fact that Nicaragua had a popular elected government is inexpressible in the U.S. propaganda system, with its standards of discipline that no respectable intellectual would dare to flout.

<P>Much of the press abroad saw the events in a similar light. The editors of the London <CITE>Financial Times</CITE> observe that "The war against the Contras has eroded the early achievements in health and education of the Sandinista revolution and brought the country close to bankruptcy." The victors, they add, are the contras -- which is to say, the White House, Congress, and the support team who set up, maintained, and justified what was conceded to be a "proxy army" by contra lobbyists, who hoped that Washington might somehow convert its proxies into a political force (Bruce Cameron and Penn Kemble of Freedom House); in vain, despite resources and advantages undreamt of by authentic popular and guerrilla movements. Their Managua correspondent Tim Coone concludes that "Nicaraguans appeared to believe that a UNO victory offered the best prospect of securing US funds to end the country's economic misery" -- correctly, of course.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT4" HREF="#FN4">4</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The left-wing Costa Rican journal <CITE>Mesoamerica</CITE> added that "the Sandinistas fell for a scam perpetrated by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias and the other Central American Presidents," which "cost them the 25 Feb. elections." Nicaragua had agreed to loosen wartime constraints and advance the scheduled elections by a few months "in exchange for having the <I>contras</I> demobilized and the war brought to an end." The White House and Congress broke the deal at once, maintaining the contras as a military force in violation of the agreements and compelling them to be modified to focus on Nicaragua alone. With the deal effectively broken, the U.S. candidate could promise to end the war, while Ortega could not. "War weary Nicaraguans voted for peace." The operation was a stunning success for White House-Congress duplicity, which succeeded brilliantly in undermining the diplomatic settlement while the media provided their crucial assistance by concealing the operation, a regular pattern in Vietnam and the Middle East as well, as documented elsewhere.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT5" HREF="#FN5">5</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>In short, the winner of the elections was George Bush and the Democrat-Republican coalition that waged ten years of economic and military aggression, leaving a hungry and distraught people who voted for relief from terror and misery. Democracy has been dealt a serious blow, with a "popular elected leftist government" replaced by one elected under duress, by violent foreign intervention that proved decisive.


<H3>United in Joy</H3>

<P>Returning home, we find a different picture. The <CITE>New Republic</CITE> editorial on the elections is entitled "Who Won Nicaragua?" The answer is: "Why, the Nicaraguans, of course" -- not George Bush and U.S. aggression. "Those who supported aid to the contras..., as did this magazine, can find considerable vindication in the outcome," which "made nonsense of both the left-wing myth that anti-Yankeeism is the centerpiece of all Latin America's political identity and the right-wing myth that Leninists can never be induced to change." Adding what remains unsaid, the former "myth" succumbed to the successful use of terror and economic strangulation, and the latter is based on the loyal denial of familiar and well-attested facts about "the Sandinistas, who had won free and fair elections in 1984" (London <CITE>Observer</CITE>). "Gratifying as the election results are," the editorial continues, "democracy is not yet quite safe in Nicaragua," and "having served as an inspiration for the triumph of democracy in our time, the United States now has an opportunity to see to it that democracy prevails" -- "democracy," <CITE>New Republic</CITE>-style: the kind that "prevails" in the Central American domains where the U.S. has had ample opportunity to entrench it, to take the obvious example.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT6" HREF="#FN6">6</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Perhaps it is unfair to illustrate U.S. reaction by a journal that gave "Reagan & Co. good marks" for their support of state terror in El Salvador as it reached Pol Pot levels in 1981, and then, surveying the carnage three years later, advised Reagan & Co. to explain to the American people that we must support "Latin-style fascists," sending military aid "regardless of how many are murdered," because "there are higher American priorities than Salvadoran human rights." In assessing U.S. political culture let us, then, put aside the more passionate advocates of state terror -- though not without noting that these values, familiar from the Nazi era, in no way diminish the reputation of the journal, or even merit a word of comment in left-liberal circles. Let us concentrate attention, rather, on what is called the "establishment left" by editor Charles William Maynes of <CITE>Foreign Policy.</CITE> He is referring specifically to the <CITE>New York Times,</CITE> but doubtless would include also the <CITE>Washington Post,</CITE> the major TV news bureaus, the <CITE>Boston Globe</CITE> (which perhaps qualifies as "ultra-left"), and his own journal, the more liberal of the two major foreign affairs quarterlies.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT7" HREF="#FN7">7</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Turning to the left, then, we begin with the <CITE>New York Times,</CITE> where Elaine Sciolino reviewed the U.S. reaction to the elections. The headline reads: "Americans United in Joy, But Divided Over Policy." The policy division turns out to be over who deserves credit for the joyous outcome, so we are left with "Americans United in Joy."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT8" HREF="#FN8">8</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Such phrases as "United in Joy" are not entirely unknown. One might find them, perhaps, in the North Korean or Albanian press. Obviously the issue was contentious, certainly to Nicaraguans, to others in Latin America as well. But not to educated U.S. elites, who are quite eager to depict themselves as dedicated totalitarians.

<P>The review of opinion opens by noting that "the left and the right and those in between [have] a fresh opportunity to debate one of the United States's most divisive foreign policy issues of the last decade." The left-right debate now reduces to who can justly claim credit. Sciolino begins with eleven paragraphs reviewing the position of the right, followed by five devoted to the left. In the former category, she cites Elliott Abrams, Jeane Kirkpatrick, Fred Ikle of the Pentagon, Oliver North, Robert Leiken of the Harvard University Center for International Affairs, and Ronald Reagan. They portray the outcome as "spectacular," "great, wonderful, stunning," a tribute to the contras who, "when history is written, ...will be the folk heroes," a victory "for the cause of democracy" in a "free and fair election."

<P>Sciolino then turns to the left: "On the other side, Lawrence A. Pezzullo, who was appointed Ambassador to Nicaragua by President fantastic'." We return to

<P>[text is missing here -- JBE]

<P>Pezzullo's left-wing credentials directly. The second representative of "the other side" is Sol Linowitz, who, as Carter Administration Ambassador to the Organization of American States (OAS), sought in vain to mobilize Latin America in support of Carter's program of "Somocismo sin Somoza" ("Somozism without Somoza") after the murderous tyrant could no longer be maintained in power, and later urged pressures to make Nicaragua more democratic -- like El Salvador and Guatemala, both just fine and hence needing no such pressures. The final representative of the left is Francis McNeil, who quit the State Department in 1987 when his pessimism about contra military prospects aroused the ire of Elliott Abrams.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT9" HREF="#FN9">9</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The last paragraph observes that some "were not entirely comfortable with the results" of the election, citing Lawrence Birns of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, who "seemed to side with the Sandinistas," expressing his "inner rage that the corner bully won over the little guy."

<P>Sciolino remarks incidentally that "Sandinista supporters expressed sadness, and said that the defeat was a product of Nicaragua's economic troubles -- a result of the American trade embargo and other outside pressures" -- thus lining up with much of Latin America. But recall that Americans were United in Joy. By simple logic, it follows that these miscreants are not Americans, or perhaps not people. Earlier <CITE>Times</CITE> reporting suggests the latter interpretation. Thus, when the <CITE>Times</CITE> reported in 1985 that "no one is arguing strenuously that [the embargo] be amended," many featherless bipeds were arguing strenuously that these murderous and illegal measures be not merely amended but terminated. Evidently, then, they bore only a superficial resemblance to the human race.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT10" HREF="#FN10">10</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Summarizing, there are "two sides," the right and the left, which differed on the tactical question of how to eliminate the Sandinistas in favor of U.S. clients and are now "United in Joy."

<P>There is one person who <I>seems</I> to side with the Sandinistas, but couldn't <I>really</I> be that far out of step, we are to understand. And there are some non-Americans, or perhaps non-humans, who share the exotic opinions of Latin Americans as to what happened and why. Having failed to obey state orders, these strange creatures are off the left-right spectrum entirely, and do not participate in the great debate over the sole issue still unresolved: Who deserves the credit for the happy outcome?

<P>The <CITE>Times</CITE> conception of the spectrum of opinion is, then, very much like that of the editor of <CITE>Foreign Policy.</CITE> Or former Undersecretary of State David Newsom, now director of the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy at Georgetown University, who urges "the ideological extremes of the nation's political spectrum" to abandon the fruitless debate over the credits for our victories. Or Jimmy Carter, who explained to the press that his observer commission was "carefully balanced -- half Democrat and half Republican," thus carefully balanced between two groups that satisfy the prior condition of objectivity: passionate opposition to the Sandinistas and support for Washington's candidates.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT11" HREF="#FN11">11</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Throughout, we see with great clarity the image of a highly disciplined political culture, deeply imbued with totalitarian values.


<H3>The Case for the Doves</H3>

<P>In the new phase of the debate, the right attributes the defeat of the Sandinistas to the contras, while the left claims that the contras impeded their effort to overthrow the Sandinistas by other means. But the doves have failed to present their case as strongly as they might. Let us therefore give them a little assistance, meanwhile recalling some crucial facts that are destined for oblivion because they are far too inconvenient to preserve.

<P>We begin with Lawrence Pezzullo, the leading representative of the left in the <CITE>Times</CITE> survey of opinion. Pezzullo was appointed Ambassador in early 1979, at a time when Carter's support for the Somoza tyranny was becoming problematic. Of course no one contemplated any modification in the basic system of power, surely no significant role for the Sandinistas (FSLN). As explained by Carter dove Robert Pastor, Director of Latin American and Caribbean Affairs on the National Security Council, there was complete agreement that Somoza's National Guard must be kept intact, and it was not until June 29, shortly before the end, that any participant in an NSC meeting "suggested the central U.S. objective was something other than preventing a Sandinista victory." By then it was finally realized that means must be sought "to moderate the FSLN," who could not be marginalized or excluded, as hoped.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT12" HREF="#FN12">12</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>As in U.S. political democracy generally, the Carter Administration had its left-right spectrum. On the right, National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski proclaimed that "we have to demonstrate that we are still the decisive force in determining the political outcomes in Central America," warning of apocalyptic outcomes if the U.S. did not intervene. On the left, Secretary of State Cyrus Vance and Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs Viron Vaky pursued a more nuanced approach. Pezzullo's task was to implement the policy of the left, that is, to bar the FSLN from power through the "preservation of existing instititutions, especially the National Guard" (Vaky, June 15, 1979). This plan was proposed to the OAS, but rejected by the Latin American governments, all ultra-left extremists, by U.S. standards. Pezzullo was then compelled to inform Somoza that his usefulness was at an end. On June 30, he noted in a cable to Washington that "with careful orchestration we have a better than even chance of preserving enough of the [National Guard] to maintain order and hold the FSLN in check after Somoza resigns," even though this plan would "smack somewhat of Somocismo sin Somoza," he added a few days later. For the "successor government," the Carter Administration approached Archbishop Obando y Bravo (in contrast, our religious sensibilities are deeply offended by political engagement of priests who envision a church that serves the poor) and the right-wing businessman Adolfo Calero (later civilian director of the main contra force); and for head of the National Guard, it considered Colonel Enrique Bermudez, later contra commander.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT13" HREF="#FN13">13</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>At the time, the National Guard was carrying out murderous attacks against civilians, leaving tens of thousands killed. Pezzullo recommended that the bloodbath be continued: "I believe it ill-advised," he cabled Washington on July 6, "to go to Somoza and ask for a bombing halt." On July 13, Pezzullo informed Washington that the "survivability" of the Guard was doubtful unless Somoza left, as he did, four days later, fleeing to Miami with what remained of the national treasury. On July 19, the game was over -- that phase, at least.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT14" HREF="#FN14">14</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>As the FSLN entered Managua on July 19, the Carter Administration "began setting the stage for a counterrevolution," Peter Kornbluh observes, mounting a clandestine operation to evacuate Guard commanders on U.S. planes disguised with Red Cross markings. This is a war crime punishable under the Geneva conventions, the London <CITE>Economist</CITE> observed years later, when the same device was used to supply contras within Nicaragua (pictures of CIA supply planes disguised with Red Cross markings appeared without comment in <CITE>Newsweek,</CITE> while the vigorous denunciation of this violation of international law by the Red Cross passed without notice in the newspaper of record). Within six months after the overthrow of Somoza, the Carter Administration had initiated the CIA destabilization campaign, inherited and expanded by the Reaganites. The Carter doves did not give direct support to the National Guard forces that they helped reconstitute, preferring to use the neo-Nazi Argentine generals "as a proxy for the United States" (Rand Corporation terrorism expert Brian Jenkins). The U.S. took over directly with the Reagan presidency.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT15" HREF="#FN15">15</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Pezzullo's next task was to "moderate the FSLN." The Carter doves proposed economic aid as "the main source of U.S. influence" (Pastor). The U.S. business community supported this plan, particularly U.S. banks, which, as noted in the London <CITE>Financial Times,</CITE> were pressuring Carter to provide funds to Nicaragua so that their loans to Somoza would be repaid (courtesy of the U.S. taxpayer, as in the Savings & Loan scam of the Reagan years). The banks were particularly concerned that if Nicaragua, reduced to utter ruin and bankruptcy by the U.S.-backed Somoza regime, were to default on the Somoza debt, it would serve as a "bad example" for other U.S. clients. It was also recognized that aid directed to anti-Sandinista elements in the ruling coalition was the last remaining device to block the FSLN and its programs.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT16" HREF="#FN16">16</A></FONT></SUP> After Nicaragua reached a settlement with the banks, $75 million in aid was offered, about 60% for the private business sector, with $5 million a grant for private organizations and $70 million a loan (partly credits to buy U.S. goods, another taxpayer subsidy to corporations). One of the conditions was that no funds be used for projects with Cuban personnel, a way of ensuring that nothing would go to schools, the literacy campaign, health programs, or other reform measures for which Nicaragua was likely to turn to those with experience in such projects and willingness to serve. Nicaragua had no choice but to agree, since, as the <CITE>Wall Street Journal</CITE> noted, without this "signal of U.S. confidence in the stability of the country" there would be no bank loans, which were desperately needed. Nicaragua's request for U.S. military aid and training was rejected, and efforts to obtain such aid from the West were blocked by U.S. pressure, compelling reliance on East bloc aid as the external threat mounted.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT17" HREF="#FN17">17</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>As these events pass through the U.S. doctrinal system, they undergo a subtle alchemy and emerge in a different form: The Sandinistas "enjoyed American encouragement at first; having helped get rid of Somoza, the Carter administration also gave them $75 million in aid. But when the Sandinistas brought in Cuban and East German military advisers to help build their Army into the region's largest fighting force, conflict with Washington was sure to follow..." (<CITE>Newsweek</CITE>).<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT18" HREF="#FN18">18</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Nicaragua also attempted to maintain its trade links with the U.S. and the West, and succeeded in doing so through the mid-1980s despite U.S. efforts. But Washington naturally preferred that they rely on the East bloc, to ensure maximal inefficiency and to justify the attack on these "Soviet clients." The U.S. also blocked aid from international development organizations, and, after failing to displace the FSLN, sought to destroy private business in Nicaragua to increase domestic discontent and undermine the mixed economy (a major and predicted effect of the Reagan embargo, and the reason why it was bitterly opposed by the Nicaraguan opposition that the U.S. claimed to support).<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT19" HREF="#FN19">19</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>So enormous was the devastation left as Somoza's final legacy that a World Bank Mission concluded in October 1981 that "per capita income levels of 1977 will not be attained, in the best of circumstances, until the late 1980s" and that "any untoward event could lead to a financial trauma." There were, of course, "untoward events," but such facts do not trouble the ideologues who deduce Sandinista responsibility for the subsequent economic debacle from the doctrinal necessity of this conclusion. A standard rhetorical trick, pioneered by the Kissinger Commission, is to "demonstrate" Sandinista economic mismanagement by comparing living standards of 1977 to those of the eighties, thus attributing the effects of the U.S.-backed Somoza terror to the Marxist-Leninist totalitarians.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT20" HREF="#FN20">20</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Despite the horrendous circumstances, Nicaragua's economic progress through the early 1980s was surprisingly good, with the highest growth rate in Central America by a large margin, an improvement in standard of living in contrast to a substantial fall for the rest of Central America and a somewhat lesser fall for Latin America as a whole, and significant redistribution of income and expansion of social services. In 1983, the Inter-American Development Bank reported that Nicaragua's "noteworthy progress in the social sector" was "laying a solid foundation for long-term socio-economic development." The World Bank and other international development organizations lauded the "remarkable" Nicaraguan record and outstanding success, in some respects "better than anywhere in the world" (World Bank). But U.S. pressures succeeded in terminating these dangerous developments. By early 1987, business leader Enrique Bolanos, well to the right of the UNO directorate, attributed the economic crisis in Nicaragua to the war (60%, presumably including the economic war), the international economic crisis (10%), the contraction of the Central American Common Market (10%), and decapitalization by the business sector and government errors (20%). The London <CITE>Financial Times</CITE> estimates the costs of the contra war at $12 billion; UNO economist Francisco Mayorga adds $3 billion as the costs of the embargo. Actual totals are unknown, but plainly fall within the range of the "untoward events" which, the World Bank predicted, would lead to catastrophe.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT21" HREF="#FN21">21</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Naturally, the idea that the U.S. might pay reparations for what it has done can be relegated to the same category as the notion that it might observe international law generally: Too ludicrous to merit a word of comment.

<P>Underlying their various tactical moves, the Carter doves had a strategic conception. Robert Pastor comments that "The United States did not want to control Nicaragua or the other nations in the region, but it also did not want to allow developments to get out of control. It wanted Nicaraguans to act independently, <I>except</I> when doing so would affect U.S. interests adversely." Nicaraguans, in short, should have complete freedom to do what we want them to do, and need not be controlled unless they are out of control.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT22" HREF="#FN22">22</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Applying these principles to Nicaragua, Viron Vaky outlined "the principal arguments" for supporting the contras: "a longer war of attrition will so weaken the regime, provoke such a radical hardening of repression, and win sufficient support from Nicaragua's discontented population that sooner or later the regime will be overthrown by popular revolt, self-destruct by means of internal coups or leadership splits, or simply capitulate to salvage what it can"; another one of those cases of "the tragic self-destruction of Central America" lamented by Theodore Sorenson. The sole aim of Reagan policy, Vaky continues, was "a negotiation on the terms and schedule under which the Sandinistas would turn over power," a goal that he sees as "reasonable" and "idealistic," while acknowledging that the U.S. proxy forces to which power is to be turned over "have been unable to elicit significant political support."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT23" HREF="#FN23">23</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>As a dove, Vaky saw these goals as unattainable, and preferred other measures (not excluding force) to "contain" the Sandinista threat and promote "the evolution of Nicaragua's internal system into a more open, less virulent one," perhaps even one as benign as in the U.S. terror states. In this way, he concludes, we might be able to reach our "objective of promoting Nicaraguan self-determination," now happily achieved, at last. The concept of democracy shines through bright and clear.

<P>With a sufficiently powerful microscope one can distinguish this left-wing perspective from that of the right, for example, the DoD official who informed the press a few months later that a small number of "hard-core guys could keep some pressure on the Nicaraguan government, force them to use their economic resources for the military, and prevent them from solving their economic problems -- and that's a plus," because "Anything that puts pressure on the Sandinista regime, calls attention to the lack of democracy, and prevents the Sandinistas from solving their economic problems is a plus."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT24" HREF="#FN24">24</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Nicaragua must be reduced to "the Albania of Central America," a State Department insider is reported to have observed in 1981. In a "Latin American Albania...the Sandinista dream of creating a new, more exemplary political model for Latin America would be in ruins," John Carlin comments in the London <CITE>Independent.</CITE> There would be no "revolution without borders" of the sort anticipated by Tomas Borge, with Nicaragua serving as a model for its neighbors, the source of a well-known fraud perpetrated by the government, the media, and segments of scholarship.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT25" HREF="#FN25">25</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Other government officials explained that they did not expect a contra victory, but were "content to see the contras debilitate the Sandinistas by forcing them to divert scarce resources toward the war and away from social programs"; the consequences could then be adduced as proof of "Sandinista mismanagement". Since this understanding is common to hawks and doves, it is not surprising that no reaction was evoked when it was reported in the <CITE>Boston Globe,</CITE> just as no reaction was to be expected when ex-CIA analyst David MacMichael testified at the World Court that the goals of the contra program were to "provoke cross-border attacks by Nicaraguan forces and thus demonstrate Nicaragua's aggressive nature" and to pressure Nicaragua to "clamp down on civil liberties" so as to demonstrate "its allegedly inherent totalitarian nature and thus increase domestic dissent within the country." It is superfluous to document the enthusiasm with which the educated classes undertook the task assigned to them in these programs.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT26" HREF="#FN26">26</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>It thus made perfect sense for the U.S. command to direct its proxy forces to attack "soft targets" -- that is, undefended civilian targets -- as SOUTHCOM commander General John Galvin explained; to train the contra forces to "attack a lot of schools, health centers, and those sort of things" so that "the Nicaraguan government cannot provide social services for the peasants, cannot develop its project." "That's the idea," contra Intelligence Chief Horacio Arce (<CITE>El Mercenario</CITE>) informed the press in Mexico after defecting in November 1988 (but not the U.S. press, which succeeded in evading such unpleasant testimony).<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT27" HREF="#FN27">27</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The Maynes-Sciolino left did not object to these policies in principle. They had no fundamental disagremeent with the conclusion of George Shultz's State Department that "Nicaragua is the cancer and [is] metastasizing" and that "the Sandinista cancer" must be removed, "by radical surgery if necessary."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT28" HREF="#FN28">28</A></FONT></SUP> Furthermore, the Carter doves effectively set these policies in motion. They can therefore claim to have succeeded in their aims, as the election showed. Their only fault was excessive pessimism over the prospects of success of terror and economic warfare; in this respect, the judgment of the right was correct, and it is unreasonable for the left to deny that their right-wing opponents had a sounder appreciation of the efficacy of state violence. Thus left and right have every reason to be United in Joy at the triumph of democracy, as they jointly conceive it: Free choice, with a pistol to your head.


<H3>"Rallying to Chamorro"</H3>

<P>The Kim Il Sung-style unanimity considered so natural and appropriate by the <CITE>Times</CITE> has, in fact, been characteristic of the "divisive foreign policy issue" that is said to have rent the United States in the past decade. As has been extensively documented, both reporting and permissible opinion in the media were virtually restricted to the question of the choice of means for returning Nicaragua to "the Central American mode." There was indeed a "division": Should this result be achieved by terror, or, if violence proved ineffective, by arrangements enforced by the death squad democracies that already observe the approved "regional standards," as advocated by Tom Wicker and other doves? This spectrum of thought was safeguarded at a level approaching 100% in the national press, a most impressive achievement.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT29" HREF="#FN29">29</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Pre-election coverage maintained the same high standards of conformism. It was uniformly anti-Sandinista. The UNO coalition were the democrats, on the sole grounds that the coalition had been forged in Washington and included the major business interests, sufficient proof of democratic credentials by the conventions of U.S. political discourse. On similar assumptions, Bob Woodward describes the CIA operations launched by Carter as a "program to boost the democratic alternative to the Sandinistas"; no evidence as to the concern for democracy is provided, or needed, on the conventional understanding of the concept of democracy.

<P>Commentary and reporting on the Sandinistas was harsh and derisive. Some did break ranks. The <CITE>Boston Globe</CITE> ran an op-ed by Daniel Ortega a few days before the election, but the editors were careful to add an accompanying caricature of an ominous thug in a Soviet Field Marshal's uniform wearing designer glasses, just to ensure that readers would not be misled.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT30" HREF="#FN30">30</A></FONT></SUP> Media monitors have yet to come up with a single phrase suggesting that an FSLN victory might be the best thing for Nicaragua. Even journalists who privately felt that way did not say it; not out of fear, I suppose, but because they took for granted that such an idea would be unintelligible, on a par with "the U.S. is a leading terrorist state," or "Washington is blocking the peace process," or "maybe we should tell the truth about Cambodia and Timor," or other departures from dogma. Such statements lack cognitive meaning. They are imprecations, like shouting "Fuck You" in public; they can only elicit a stream of abuse, not a rational response. This is the ultimate achievement of thought control, beyond what Orwell imagined. Large parts of the language are simply ruled unthinkable. It all makes good sense: In a Free Society, <I>all</I> must march on command, or keep silent. Anything else is just too dangerous.

<P>There must have been departures somewhere, but the performance in the mainstream would have impressed any dictator.

<P>On TV, Peter Jennings opened the international news by announcing that Nicaragua is going to have its "first free election in a decade."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT31" HREF="#FN31">31</A></FONT></SUP> Three crucial doctrines are presupposed: (1) the elections under Somoza were free; (2) there was no free election in 1984; (3) the 1990 election was free and uncoerced. A standard footnote is that Ortega was driven to accept the 1990 elections by U.S. pressure; here opinion divides, with the right and the left differing on who deserves the credit for the achievement. Recall that truly sophisticated propagandists understand that it is a mistake to articulate basic doctrines, thus opening them to critical reflection. Rather, they are to be presupposed, setting the bounds of thinkable thought.

<P>We may disregard point (1), though not without noting that it has been a staple of the "establishment left," with its frequent reference to "restoring democracy" in Nicaragua. The second point expresses a fundamental dogma, which brooks no deviation and is immune to fact; I need not review this matter, familiar outside of the reigning doctrinal system. The footnote ignores the unacceptable (hence unreportable) fact that the next election had always been scheduled for 1990, and that the total effect of U.S. machinations was to advance it by a few months.

<P>The most interesting point, however, is the third. Suppose that the USSR were to follow the U.S. model as the Baltic states declare independence, organizing a proxy army to attack them from foreign bases, training its terrorist forces to hit "soft targets" (health centers, schools, etc.) so that the governments cannot provide social services, reducing the economies to ruin through embargo and other sanctions, and so on, in the familiar routine. Suppose further that when elections come, the Kremlin informs the population, loud and clear, that they can vote for the CP or starve. Perhaps some unreconstructed Stalinist might call this a "free and fair election." Surely no one else would.

<P>Or suppose that the Arab states were to reduce Israel to the level of Ethiopia, then issuing a credible threat that they would drive it the rest of the way unless it "cried uncle" and voted for their candidate. Someone who called this a "democratic election," "free and fair," would be condemned as an outright Nazi.

<P>The pertinence of the analogies is obvious. Simple logic suffices to show that anyone who called the 1990 Nicaraguan elections "free and fair," a welcome step towards democracy, was not merely a totalitarian, but of a rather special variety. Fact: That practice was virtually exceptionless. I have found exactly <I>one</I> mainstream journalist who was able to make the obvious points.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT32" HREF="#FN32">32</A></FONT></SUP> Surely other examples must exist, but the conclusion, which we need not spell out, tells us a great deal about the dominant intellectual culture.

<P>It was apparent from the outset that the U.S. would never tolerate free and fair elections, as I have been emphasizing in these columns since the campaign opened in October. The point was underscored by repeated White House statements that the terror and economic war would continue unless a "free choice" met the conditions of the Enforcer. It was made official in early November when the White House announced that the embargo would continue unless the population followed U.S. orders. In a political culture that is more free and independent than ours -- the military-run terror state of Guatemala, for example -- the media had no difficulty perceiving these trivialities, as we have already seen.

<P>To be sure, the kinds of "divisions" that the <CITE>Times</CITE> perceives were to be found here as well. There were a few who simply denied that the military and economic wars had any notable impact; what could a mere $15 billion and 30,000 dead mean to a society as rich and flourishing as Nicaragua after Somoza?<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT33" HREF="#FN33">33</A></FONT></SUP> Turning to those who tried to be serious, we find the usual two categories. The right didn't mention these crucial factors, and hailed the stunning triumph of democracy. The establishment left did mention them, and <I>then</I> hailed the stunning triumph of democracy. Still keeping to that sector of opinion, let us consider a few examples to illustrate the pattern.

<P>Michael Kinsley, who represents the left on the <CITE>New Republic</CITE> editorial staff and in CNN television debate, presented his analysis of the election in the journal he edits (reprinted in the <CITE>Washington Post</CITE>).<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT34" HREF="#FN34">34</A></FONT></SUP> He recalled an earlier article of his, omitting its crucial content: that terrorist attacks against civilian targets are legitimate if a "cost-benefit analysis" shows that the "blood and misery that will be poured in" yields consequences that he takes to be favorable. This doctrine, which could readily be accepted by Abu Nidal, helps us situate the establishment left in the general spectrum.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT35" HREF="#FN35">35</A></FONT></SUP> Kinsley then observes that "impoverishing the people of Nicaragua was precisely the point of the contra war and the parallel policy of economic embargo and veto of international development loans," and it is "Orwellian" to blame the Sandinistas "for wrecking the economy while devoting our best efforts to doing precisely that." "The economic disaster was probably the victorious opposition's best election issue," he continues, and "it was also Orwellian for the United States, having created the disaster, to be posturing as the exhorter and arbiter of free elections."

<P>Kinsley then proceeds to posture, Orwellian-style, as the arbiter of free elections, hailing the "free election" and "triumph of democracy," which "turned out to be pleasanter than anyone would have dared to predict."

<P>At the extreme of the establishment left, Anthony Lewis of the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> writes that "the Reagan policy did not work. It produced only misery, death and shame." Why it did not work, he does not explain; it appears to have worked very well, including those parts that were supported throughout by the doves. Lewis then proceeds to hail "the experiment in peace and democracy," which "did work." This triumph of democracy, he writes, gives "fresh testimony to the power of Jefferson's idea: government with the consent of the governed, as Vaclav Havel reminded us the other day. To say so seems romantic, but then we live in a romantic age." We are "dizzy with success," as Stalin used to say, observing the triumph of our ideals in Central America and the Caribbean, the Philippines, the Israeli-occupied territories, and other regions where our influence reaches so that we can take credit for the conditions of life and the state of freedom.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT36" HREF="#FN36">36</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The reference to Havel merits some reflection. Havel's address to Congress had a remarkable impact on the political and intellectual communities. "Consciousness precedes Being, and not the other way around, as the Marxists claim," Havel informed Congress to thunderous applause; in a Woody Allen rendition, he would have said "Being precedes Consciousness," eliciting exactly the same reaction. But what really enthralled elite opinion was his statement that the United States has "understood the responsibility that flowed" from its great power, that there have been "two enormous forces -- one, a defender of freedom, the other, a source of nightmares." We must put "morality ahead of politics," he went on. The backbone of our actions must be "responsibility -- responsibility to something higher than my family, my country, my company, my success." To be moral, then, we must not shirk our responsibility to suffering people in the Dominican Republic, Timor, Vietnam, Guatemala, El Salvador, Mozambique, and others like them throughout the world who can offer direct testimony to the great works of the "defender of freedom."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT37" HREF="#FN37">37</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>These thoughts evoked an overwhelming reaction. Lewis was not alone in being entranced. The <CITE>Washington Post</CITE> described them as "stunning evidence" that Havel's country is "a prime source" of "the European intellectual tradition," a "voice of conscience" that speaks "compellingly of the responsibilities that large and small powers owe each other." The <CITE>Boston Globe</CITE> hailed Havel for having "no use for cliches" as he gave us his "wise counsel" in a manner so "lucid and logical." Mary McGrory reveled in "his idealism, his irony, his humanity," as he "preached a difficult doctrine of individual responsibility" while Congress "obviously ached with respect" for his genius and integrity. Columnists Jack Germond and Jules Witcover asked why America lacks intellectuals so profound, who "elevate morality over self-interest" in this way. A front-page story in the <CITE>Globe</CITE> described how "American politicans and pundits are gushing over" Havel, and interviewed locals on why American intellectuals do not approach these lofty heights.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT38" HREF="#FN38">38</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>This reaction too provides a useful mirror for the elite culture.

<P>Putting aside the relation of Being to Consciousness, the thoughts that so entranced the intellectual community are, after all, not entirely unfamiliar. One finds them regularly in the pontifications of fundamentalist preachers, Fourth of July speeches, American Legion publications, the journals and scholarly literature generally, indeed, everywhere. Who can have been so remote from American life as not to have heard that we are "the defender of freedom" and that we magnificently satisfy the moral imperative to be responsible not just to ourselves, but to the Welfare of Mankind? There is only one rational interpretation. Liberal intellectuals secretly cherish the pronouncements of Pat Robertson and the John Birch society, but are embarrassed to say so; they can therefore gush in awe when these very same words are produced by Vaclav Havel.

<P>Havel's "voice of conscience" has another familiar counterpart. In the Third World, one sometimes hears people say that the Soviet Union defends our freedom while the U.S. government is a nightmare. I have heard such sentiments in remote villages in Vietnam in areas destroyed by U.S. bombardment, in the Israeli-occupied territories, and other places, as have many others. Journalist T.D. Allman, who wrote one of the few serious articles on El Salvador in the early eighties, described a visit to a Christian base community, subjected to the standard practice of the U.S.-backed security forces, where an old man told him that he had heard of a country called Cuba across the seas that might have concern for their plight, and asked Allman to "tell us, please, sir, how we might contact these Cubans, to inform them of our need, so that they might help us."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT39" HREF="#FN39">39</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Let us now try another thought experiment. Suppose a villager in Vietnam, or Allman's Salvadoran peasant, had reached the Supreme Soviet to orate about moral responsibility and the confrontation between two powers, one a nightmare and the other a defender of freedom. There would doubtless have been a rousing ovation, while every party hack in <CITE>Pravda</CITE> would have gushed with enthusiasm. I do not, incidentally, mean to draw a comparison to Havel. It is easy to understand that the world might look this way to someone whose experience is limited to U.S. bombs and U.S.-trained death squads on the one hand, and, on the other, Soviet tractors and anti-aircraft guns, and dreams of rescue by Cubans from unbearable torment. For victims of the West, the circumstances of existence -- incomparably worse than those of Eastern Europe -- make the conclusion plausible while barring knowledge of a broader reality. Havel and those who gush over his familiar pieties can claim no such excuse.

<P>We once again learn something about ourselves, if we choose. The other <CITE>Times</CITE> spokesman for the left, Tom Wicker, followed the same script. He concludes that the Sandinistas lost "because the Nicaraguan people were tired of war and sick of economic deprivation." But the elections were "free and fair," untainted by coercion.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT40" HREF="#FN40">40</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>At the dissident extreme, William LeoGrande also hailed the promise of the "democratic elections in Nicaragua," while noting that "In the name of democracy, Washington put excruciating military and economic pressure on Nicaragua in order to force the Sandinistas out of power." Now, he continues, "the United States must show that its commitment to democracy in Central America extends to pressuring friendly conservative governments as well." Thus, having demonstrated its "commitment to democracy" by terror and economic warfare, the U.S. should "extend" this libertarian fervor to pressure on its friends.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT41" HREF="#FN41">41</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Turning to the shining light of American liberalism, the lead editorial in the <CITE>Boston Globe</CITE> was headlined "Rallying to Chamorro." All those who truly "love Nicaraguans," editorial page editor Martin Nolan declared, "must now rally to Chamorro." Suppose that in 1964 someone had said that all Goldwater supporters "must now rally to Johnson." Such a person would have been regarded as a throwback to the days when the Gauleiters and Commissars recognized that everyone must rally behind der Fuehrer. In Nicaragua, which has not yet risen to our heights, no one issued such a pronouncement. We learn more about the prevailing conception of democracy.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT42" HREF="#FN42">42</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Nolan goes on to explain that "Ortega was not an adept politician. His beloved masses could not eat slogans and voted with their stomachs, not their hearts." If Ortega had been more adept, he could have provided them with food -- by following Nolan's advice and capitulating to the master. Now, in this "blessing of democracy," "at long last, Nicaragua itself has spoken" -- freely and without duress, wherever "their hearts" may have been.

<P><CITE>Times</CITE> correspondent David Shipler contributed his thoughts under the headline "Nicaragua, Victory for U.S. Fair Play." Following the liberal model, Shipler observes that "it is true that partly because of the confrontation with the U.S., Nicaragua's economy suffered terribly, setting the stage for the widespread public discontent with the Sandinistas reflected in Sunday's balloting." Conclusion? "The Nicaraguan election has proved that open, honorable support for a democratic process is one of the most powerful foreign policy tools at Washington's disposal" -- to be sure, after imposing "terrible suffering" to ensure the proper outcome in a "Victory for U.S. Fair Play." Shipler adds that now Nicaragua "needs help in building democratic institutions" -- which he and his colleagues are qualified to offer, given their profound understanding of true democracy.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT43" HREF="#FN43">43</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>In <CITE>Newsweek,</CITE> Charles Lane recognized that U.S. efforts to "democratize Nicaragua" through the contra war and "devastating economic sanctions" carried "a terrible cost," including 30,000 dead and another half million "uprooted from their homes," "routine" resort to "kidnapping and assassination," and other unpleasantness. So severe were the effects that "by the end of 1988, it was pride alone that kept the Sandinistas from meeting

<P>[text is missing here -- JBE]

<P>cry uncle'!" But the population finally voted for "a chance to put behind them the misery brought on by 10 years of revolution and war." "In the end, it was the Nicaraguans who won Nicaragua." We must "celebrate the moment" while reflecting "on the peculiar mix of good intentions and national insecurities that led us to become so passionately involved in a place we so dimly understood."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT44" HREF="#FN44">44</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The moral cowardice reeks even more than the hypocrisy.

<P>Editorials in the national press hailed "the good news from Nicaragua," "a devastating rebuke to Sandinistas," which "will strengthen democracy elsewhere in Central America as well" (<CITE>New York Times</CITE>). The editors do recognize that one question is "debatable," namely, "whether U.S. pressure and the contra war hastened or delayed the wonderful breakthrough." But "No matter; democracy was the winner," in elections free and fair. Note that this contribution falls on the "conservative" side of the debate: No mention of the crucial factors, rather than mention and dismissal, as in the liberal model. The <CITE>Washington Post</CITE> editors hoped that these elections would launch "Nicaragua on a conclusive change from a totalitarian to a democratic state," but are not sure. "The Masses Speak in Nicaragua," a headline reads, employing a term that is taboo apart from such special occasions.

<P>The <CITE>Christian Science Monitor</CITE> exulted over "another stunning assertion of democracy," an unflawed triumph.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT45" HREF="#FN45">45</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Perhaps that is enough. I have sampled only the less egregious cases, avoiding the right. It would be hard to find an exception to the pattern.

<P>Several features of the election coverage are particularly striking: the extraordinary uniformity; the hatred and contempt for democracy revealed with such stark clarity across the political spectrum; and the utter incapacity to perceive these simple facts. Exceptions are marginal indeed.


<H3>Within Nicaragua</H3>

<P>I have kept to the factual circumstances and the reaction here, saying nothing about why Nicaraguans voted as they did under the conditions imposed upon them by the terrorist superpower, an important question, but a different one. But the Nicaraguan reaction merits a few comments for what it shows about U.S. political culture.

<P>Within the United States, the standard reaction was joyous acclaim for the Nicaraguan "masses" who had triumphed over their oppressors in fair elections. In Nicaragua, the reaction seems to have been rather different. After informing us that the winners were "the Nicaraguans, of course," the <CITE>New Republic</CITE> turns to its Managua correspondent Tom Gjelten, who writes: "UNO victory rallies were small, mostly private affairs, and there was no mass outpouring into the streets. Most people stayed home." Almost a month after the elections, AP reported that "UNO supporters still have not held a public celebration." Many other reports from around Nicaragua confirm the somber mood, which contrasts strikingly to the Unity in Joy here. The comparison may suggest something about who won and who lost, but the thought was not pursued -- here, that is; in Latin America, the meaning was taken to be clear enough.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT46" HREF="#FN46">46</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>AP reporter Candice Hughes filed an interesting report from Bluefields on the Atlantic Coast, where "Anti-communism runs deep, a legacy of the region's ties to the Yankees who mined its gold, cut its lumber, fished its waters, and to the missionary fervor of the Moravians and the Capuchin priests who educated its children"; a well-known center of opposition to the Sandinistas with close ties of travel and trade with the United States, so much so that "anti-Cuban riots erupted when the government announced plans to send in more teachers" in 1980. A Cuban medical brigade has been working in Bluefields, "15 idealistic envoys of a revolution becoming isolated and stale," along with a construction brigade that is building 5,000 homes to replace those destroyed in Hurricane Joan (which devastated the region, eliciting aid from Cuba and U.S. citizens who are non-Americans by <CITE>Times</CITE> standards, but few others). The Cubans are living in a complex they built that will become a university when they leave. They stayed home after the elections, and "Bluefields got a taste of life without the Cubans," as "things fell apart" at the hospital and construction stopped. "After two days, community leaders went to the Cubans and persuaded them to return to work, reassuring them they were not only safe, but desperately needed. The experience converted all but the most fervent anti-communists in Bluefields," the Nicaraguan doctor who directs the local hospital said: "People changed colors like chameleons." Hughes reports that "today, many Bluefilenos dread the Cubans' departure," which "would strip Nicaragua's isolated South Atlantic coast" of its major medical services and "would shatter the vision" of the "sturdy new homes replacing shacks flattened by Hurricane Joan."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT47" HREF="#FN47">47</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Yet another Nicaraguan reaction is described by <CITE>Times</CITE> reporter Larry Rohter, in a typically bitter and scornful condemnation of the "internationalists," who carry out such despicable activities as fixing bicycles and distributing grain "to child care centers and maternity clinics," and who intend to continue "serving the vast majority of workers and peasants whose needs have not diminished," an activist in the Casa

<P>[text is missing here -- JBE]

<P>Benjamin Linder says. Rohter quotes Vice President-elect Virgilio Godoy, who says that the new government will keep a close eye on these intruders: "we are not going to permit any foreigner to interfere in our domestic political problems."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT48" HREF="#FN48">48</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>In a well-disciplined society, no one laughs when such statements are reported. Under the totalitarian Sandinistas, foreigners were permitted to forge a political coalition based upon the terrorist force they created to attack the country and to pour millions of dollars into supporting it. Foreigners engaged in what the World Court condemned as "the unlawful use of force" against Nicaragua were nevertheless allowed to fund a major newspaper that called for the overthrow of the government and openly identified with the terrorist forces pursuing these ends, proxies of the foreign power funding the journal. Under these totalitarians, such foreigners as Jeane Kirkpatrick and U.S. Congressmen were permitted to enter the country to present public speeches and news conferences calling for the overthrow of the government by violence and supporting the foreign-run terrorist forces. "Human Rights" investigators accompanied by contra lobbyists posing as "experts" were permitted free access, along with journalists who were scarcely more than agents of the foreign power attacking the country. Nothing remotely resembling this record can be found in Western democracies; in the United States, Israel, England, and other democracies, such freedoms would be inconceivable, even under far less threat, as the historical record demonstrates with utter clarity.

<P>But now, at last, totalitarianism is yielding to freedom, so Nicaragua will no longer tolerate "interference" from foreigners who have the wrong ideas about how to contribute to reform and development, foreigners who are not working for the violent overthrow of the government but rather are supporting the only mass-based political force in the country.

<P>In short, freedom in Nicaragua is over, so, naturally, "Americans are United in Joy." Again we see exactly what is meant by "freedom" and "democracy" in the elite political culture.


<H3>Looking Ahead</H3>

<P>Let us depart now from the factual record and turn to a few speculations.

<P>A fundamental goal of U.S. policy towards Latin America (and elsewhere), long-standing and well-documented, is to take control of the police and military so as to assure that the population will not act upon unacceptable ideas. As Edward Herman has observed, just as there are "worthy and unworthy victims" (the worthy being those persecuted by official enemies, who arouse great anguish, the unworthy being our victims, whose fate is therefore a matter of indifference), so there are "worthy and unworthy armies." Worthy armies, such as those of Somoza, El Salvador, Guatemala, South Africa, or Indonesia, need no interference, because they are doing their job quite satisfactorily. Unworthy armies, which do not meet these high standards, must be reformed. In Nicaragua, then, the goal will be to restore something like the Somozist National Guard, following the prescriptions of the Carter doves.

<P>A secondary goal is to destroy any independent press. Sometimes this requires murderous violence, as in El Salvador and Guatemala. The broad elite approval of the practice is evident from the reaction when it is carried out; typically, silence, coupled with praise for the advances towards democracy. Sometimes market forces suffice, as in Costa Rica, where the Spanish language press is a monopoly of the ultra-right, so there are no concerns about freedom of the press.

<P>More generally, there are two legitimate forces in Latin America: First and foremost, the United States; secondarily, the local oligarchy, military, and business groups that associate themselves with the interests of U.S. economic and political elites. If these forces hold power without challenge, all is well. The playing field is level, and if formal elections are held, it will be called "democracy." If there is any challenge from the general population, a firm response is necessary. The establishment left and right will typically differ over tolerable levels of atrocities, repression, and general misery.

<P>In Nicaragua, it will not be so simple to attain the traditional objectives. Any resistance to them will, of course, be condemned as "Sandinista totalitarianism." One can write the editorials in advance, just as those with sufficient literary skill might be able to write the unpublishable editorials on the reality of life in U.S. domains.

<P>Perhaps the political coalition constructed by Washington will be unable to meet the demands imposed upon it by the master. If so, new managers will be needed. It is clear where to turn. There is a mass-based political organization, and if it can be brought to heel, perhaps it can be assigned the task. The point was made obliquely by the <CITE>Wall Street Journal,</CITE> in its triumphal editorial on the elections. "In time," the editors wrote, "Daniel Ortega may discover the moderating influences of democratic elections, as did Jamaica's Michael Manley, himself formerly a committed Marxist."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT49" HREF="#FN49">49</A></FONT></SUP> Translating from Newspeak, the U.S. may have to try the Jamaica model, first working to undermine and destroy a popular movement, then lavishly supporting the preferred capitalist alternative that proved to be a miserable failure, then turning to the populist Manley to manage the resulting disaster -- but <I>for us,</I> now that he and the population generally have been tamed, and understand that they have no choice but to follow orders.

<P>The point is widely understood, though generally left tacit in the media. As if by instinct, when the election returns were announced, Ortega was instantaneously tranformed from a villain to a statesman, with real promise. He can be kept in the wings, to be called upon if needed to follow our directions.

<P>The policy is routine. Once popular movements are crushed, once the dream of a better future is abandoned and "the masses" understand that their only hope is to shine shoes for whitey, then it makes good sense to allow a "democratic process" that may even bring former enemies to power. They can then administer the ruins, for us. A side benefit is that populist forces are thereby discredited. Thus the U.S. was quite willing to permit Manley to take over after the failure of the Reaganite free market experiment, and would observe with equanimity (indeed, much pride in our tolerance of diversity) if Juan Bosch wins the elections in the Dominican Republic. There is no longer any need to send the Marines to bar him from office as in 1965, when the population arose, defeating the army and restoring the populist constitutional regime that had been overthrown by a U.S.-backed coup. After years of death squads, starvation, mass flight of desperate boat people, and takeover of the rest of the economy by U.S. corporations, we need not be troubled by democratic forms. On the same reasoning, it is sometimes a good idea to encourage Black mayors -- if possible, civil rights leaders -- to preside over the decline of what is left of the inner cities of the domestic Third World. Once demoralization is thorough and complete, they can run the wreckage and control the population. Perhaps Ortega and the Sandinistas, having come to their senses after a dose of reality administered by the guardian of order, will be prepared to take on this task if the chosen U.S. proxies fail.

<P>If all works well, Maynes's establishment left will once again be able to celebrate what he calls the U.S. campaign "to spread the cause of democracy." It is true, he observes, that sometimes things don't quite work out. Thus "specialists may point out that the cause of democracy suffered some long-run setbacks in such places as Guatemala and Iran because of earlier CIA successes' in overthrowing governments there," but ordinary folk

<P>[text is missing here -- JBE]

<P>will not be troubled by the human consequences of these setbacks.

<P>More successful is the case of the Dominican Republic, or Grenada, where the cause of democracy triumphed at not too great a cost to us, "and the island has not been heard from since." There has been no need to report the recent meaningless elections, the social dissolution and decay, the state of siege instituted by the official democrats, the decline of conditions of life, and other standard concomitants of "the defense of freedom." Perhaps, with luck, Nicaragua will prove to be a success of which we can be equally proud. Panama is already well along the familiar road.

<P>While the official left and right differ in their tolerance for atrocities and misery, we should bear in mind that the standards are quite high, on all sides. As an illustration, consider the events of March 22-24 in El Salvador, a three-day commemoration of the tenth anniversary of the assassination of Archbishop Romero. "The poor, the humble and the devout flocked by the thousands" to honor his memory at a Mass in the cathedral where he was murdered, AP reported, filling the plaza and the streets outside after a march led by 16 bishops, three from the United States. Romero is being formally proposed for sainthood by the Salvadoran Church -- the first such case since Archbishop Thomas a Becket was assassinated at the altar over 800 years ago. Americas Watch published a report on the shameful decade, symbolically bounded by "these two events -- the murder of Archbishop Romero in 1980 and the slaying of the Jesuits in 1989" -- which offer "harsh testimony about who really rules El Salvador and how little they have changed," people for whom "priest-killing is still a preferred option" because they "simply will not hear the cries for change and justice in a society that has had too little of either." In his homily, Archbishop Romero's successor, Archbishop Arturo Rivera y Damas, said that "For being the voice of those without voice, he was violently silenced."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT50" HREF="#FN50">50</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The victims remain without voice, and the Archbishop remains silenced as well. No high-ranking official of the Cristiani government or his Arena party attended the Mass, not even their leader Roberto d'Aubuisson, assumed to be responsible for the assassination in coordination with the U.S.-backed security forces. The U.S. government was also notable for its absence. The anniversary passed with scarcely a notice in the country that funds and trains the assassins. Not a great surprise, after all, considering that from the start the media suppressed the circumstances of the assassination, the evidence of military complicity, and the role of the U.S. government in the background events and the aftermath. The assassination did not even merit an editorial in the <CITE>New York Times.</CITE> Why trouble, then, to remember ten years later?<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT51" HREF="#FN51">51</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>There should be no further embarrassment, however -- assuming that there is any now. This will be the last public religious homage to Romero for decades, because Church doctrine prohibits homage for candidates for sainthood. Revulsion at the assassination of Thomas a Becket compelled King Henry II, who was held to be indirectly responsible, to do penance at the shrine. One will wait a long time for a proper reenactment, another sign of the progress of civilization.

<P>Outside of the official left-right spectrum, the non-people have other values and commitments, and a quite different understanding of responsibility to something other than ourselves and of the cause of democracy and freedom. They will also understand that solidarity work is now becoming even more critically important than before. Every effort will be made to de-educate the general population so that they sink to the intellectual and moral level of the cultural and social managers. Those who do not succumb have a historic mission, and should not forget that.

<CITE>Z Magazine,</CITE> July 1988
</CENTER>


<P>One of the great themes of modern history is the struggle of subjugated people to gain control over their lives and fate. In April, I visited Israel and the occupied territories, where one of these struggles has reached a level of dramatic intensity. A few months earlier, I was in Nicaragua, a remarkable example of the will and ability of a desperately impoverished country to survive -- though just barely -- and to resist the assault of a terrorist superpower. Somehow, whatever the amount of reading and intensity of concern, it is just different to see it at first hand.

<P>The privileged often regard these struggles as an assault on their rights, violent outbursts instigated by evil forces bent on our destruction: world Communism, or crazed terrorists and fanatics. The struggle for freedom seems inexplicable in other terms. After all, living standards are higher in Soweto than they were in the Stone Age, or even elsewhere in Black Africa. And the people in the West Bank and Gaza who survive by doing Israel's dirty work are improving their lot by standard economic measures. Slave owners offered similar arguments.

<P>Being so evidently irrational, the revolt of the dispossessed must be guided by evil intent or primitive nature. Why should one care about humiliation and degradation if these conditions are accompanied by some measure of economic growth? Why should people sacrifice material welfare and rising expectations in a quixotic search for freedom and self-respect? On the assumption that the basic human emotion and the driving force of a sane society is the desire for material gain, such questions have no simple answer, so we seek something more sophisticated and arcane. Two hundred years ago, Rousseau wrote with withering contempt about his civilized countrymen who have lost the very concept of freedom and "do nothing but boast incessantly of the peace and repose they enjoy in their chains.... But when I see the others sacrifice pleasures, repose, wealth, power, and life itself for the preservation of this sole good which is so disdained by those who have lost it; when I see animals born free and despising captivity break their heads against the bars of their prison; when I see multitudes of entirely naked savages scorn European voluptuousness and endure hunger, fire, the sword, and death to preserve only their independence, I feel that it does not behoove slaves to reason about freedom."

<P>These words kept coming to my mind as I was travelling through the West Bank, as they have before in similar circumstances. It is a rare privilege to glimpse a moment of a popular struggle for freedom and justice. Right now the uprising is just that, wherever it may lead under the conditions imposed by the occupier and the paymaster.


<H3>Repression and Resistance</H3>

<P>Israel has tried killing, beating, gassing, mass arrests, deportation, destruction of houses, curfews and other forms of harsh collective punishment. Nothing has succeeded in enforcing obedience or eliciting a violent response. The Palestinian uprising is a remarkable feat of collective self-discipline. It is quite different from the struggle of the Jews of Palestine for a Jewish state, with the murder of British officials, the assassination of UN mediator Folke Bernadotte, the hanging of British hostages, and many atrocities against Arab civilians. The current Prime Minister of Israel, commander of the group that assassinated Bernadotte, lauded terror as a moral imperative. "Neither Jewish ethics nor Jewish tradition can disqualify terrorism as a means of combat," he wrote. "First and foremost, terrorism is for us a part of the political battle being conducted under the present circumstances, and it has a great part to play...in our war against the occupier."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1" HREF="#FN1">1</A></FONT></SUP> Some would have us believe that such thoughts, and the practices that follow from them, were only the province of extremists, and were abandoned with the establishment of the state that the press describes as the "symbol of human decency," "a society in which moral sensitivity is a principle of political life" (<CITE>New York Times</CITE>), which has been guided by "high moral purpose...through its tumultuous history" (<CITE>Time</CITE>).<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2" HREF="#FN2">2</A></FONT></SUP> There is an extensive record to undermine such delusions. Furthermore, the political leadership was reluctant to condemn terrorist practices. In laudatory reminiscences, Isaiah Berlin observes that Chaim Weizmann "did not think it morally decent to denounce either the acts [of Jewish terror] or their perpetrators in public...he did not propose to speak out against acts, criminal as he thought them, which sprang from the tormented minds of men driven to desperation...."; David Ben-Gurion kept secret the confession of a close friend that he was among the assassins of Bernadotte.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3" HREF="#FN3">3</A></FONT></SUP> National movements and struggles typically have a record of violence and terror, not least our own, and Israel is no exception to the norm.

<P>During its struggle for independence, the Jewish community in Palestine could assume some degree of restraint on the part of the British forces. Palestinians know full well that they could expect no such restraint were they to follow the course of the Zionists. Even nonviolent actions -- political efforts and merchant strikes, for example, even verbal and symbolic expression -- have long been repressed by force, failing for lack of support from outside, not least among those who laud the virtues of such means. If the British had treated the Jews of Palestine in the manner of the Israeli repression over many years, there would have been an uproar in England and throughout the world. Imagine the reaction if the Soviet police were to deal with refuseniks in any way comparable to the Israeli practices that briefly reached the television screens. Israeli commentators have noted the sharp contrast between the restraint of British forces and Israeli brutality in response to Palestinian resistance that has remained remarkably disciplined, something that may not last forever. As I write, the press reports -- in one single day -- violent protests in Taiwan, France, South Korea and Manila with firebombs and clubbing of police, and hundreds of injuries, very few among the demonstrators and rioters. These are not states known for their delicacy; still, the picture is remote from Israeli practices in less threatening circumstances.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT4" HREF="#FN4">4</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>There is a double standard, as commonly alleged by apologists for Israeli violence; it is just the opposite of what is claimed, and has been so for many years.

<P>Israeli philosopher Avishai Margalit compares the "ethos of restraint" of the South Korean police to the doctrine applied by Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin of the Labor Party: that brutal beatings are "necessary...to restore the soldier's honor in the face of the challenge from Palestinians."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT5" HREF="#FN5">5</A></FONT></SUP> The difference, he argues, lies in cultural differences with regard to the concept of honor. Perhaps so, but the factor of racism should not be overlooked. As the uprising gathered force, Orthodox Jews protesting movies on Sabbath pelted cars and police with stones and metal frames hurled from houses; no killings or sadistic beatings were reported then, nor six months later, when hundreds of Jewish workers broke into the Finance Ministry, smashing windows and injuring police and officials in a labor protest.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT6" HREF="#FN6">6</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Margalit comments that "the announced wish of the Israeli government...to restore `law and order'...has been accurately translated: `to erase the smile from the face of Palestinian youth'." The phrase is apt. Soldiers beating Arabs on a main street in West Jerusalem shout that "they dare to raise their heads." The lesson taught to the Arabs is "that you should not raise your head," Israeli author Shulamith Hareven reports from Gaza, where the hallmark of the occupation for 20 years has been "degradation" and "constant harassment...for its own sake, evil for its own sake." "A man walks in the street and [soldiers and settlers] call him: `come here, donkey'." A Hebrew phrase that Arabs quickly learn is "you are all thieves and bastards." A woman returning from study in the United States is insulted and mocked by soldiers at the border, who laugh at the "fine clothes this one has" as they display them to one another during baggage inspection; another is called out at midnight by a kick at her door and ordered by soldiers to read graffiti on a wall. Visiting Gaza shortly before the uprising, Prime Minister Shamir called city officials and notables to meet him, left them waiting outdoors before a locked door, and when they were finally allowed their say, abruptly informed them that Israel would never leave Gaza and departed; "humiliation from this source has a definite political significance," Hareven adds, and did not pass unnoticed among people who have learned that "the Jews understand nothing but force."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT7" HREF="#FN7">7</A></FONT></SUP> These are the conditions of everyday life, more telling than the corpses and broken bones. The similarity to the deep South in its worst days is plain enough.

<P>In the May issue of <CITE>Z,</CITE> I cited examples of the racism of the Zionist movement from its origins, including the most admired liberal elements. The phenomenon is typical of European colonialism, for example, George Washington, who referred to the "merciless Indian savages" of the Declaration of Independence as "beasts of prey, tho' they differ in shape," who must be treated accordingly.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT8" HREF="#FN8">8</A></FONT></SUP> Today, extraordinary comments pass virtually unnoticed. I will mention only one example, because of its relevance to the elite media here as well.

<P>While I was in Israel, <CITE>Times</CITE> correspondent Thomas Friedman had lengthy interviews in the Hebrew press in connection with his Pulitzer Prize award for "balanced and informed coverage," including gross falsification in the service of Israeli rejectionism, a few examples of which I cited in the May issue.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT9" HREF="#FN9">9</A></FONT></SUP> He repeated some of the fabrications he has helped establish, for example, that the Palestinians "refuse to come to terms with the existence of Israel, and prefer to offer themselves as sacrifices." He went on to laud his brilliance for having "foreseen completely the uprising in the territories" -- a surprise to his regular readers, perhaps -- while writing "stories that no one else had ever sent" with unique "precision" and perception; prior to his insights, he explained, Israel was "the most fully reported country in the world, but the least understood in the media." Friedman also offered his solution to the problem of the territories. The model should be South Lebanon, controlled by a terrorist mercenary army backed by Israeli might. The basic principle must be "security, not peace." Nevertheless, the Palestinians should not be denied everything: "Only if you give the Palestinians something to lose is there a hope that they will agree to moderate their demands" -- that is, beyond the "demand" for mutual recognition in a two-state settlement, the long-standing position that Friedman refuses to report, and consistently denies. He continues: "I believe that as soon as Ahmed has a seat in the bus, he will limit his demands."

<P>One can imagine a similar comment by a southern sheriff in Mississippi 30 years ago ("give Sambo a seat in the bus, and he may quiet down"). This passed with no notable reaction.

<P>It comes as little surprise that after the prize was announced on April 1, Friedman found it a much happier occasion than when he received the same prize for his reporting from Lebanon at "a moment very much bittersweet" because of the bombing of the American Embassy in Beirut shortly before. This time, however, the award was "unalloyed, untinged by any tragedy," he said, nothing unpleasant having happened on his beat during the preceding months.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT10" HREF="#FN10">10</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Current Israeli tactics break no new ground; it is only the scale of violence that has extended, as the resistance has swept over virtually the whole of Palestinian society. Years ago, "opening fire in response to throwing stones" had become "a casual matter" (<CITE>Davar,</CITE> Nov. 21, 1980). Systematic torture has been documented since the earliest days of the occupation, a fact now conceded by the official Landau Commission, headed by a respected former Supreme Justice, which recommends "moderate physical pressure" -- "a euphemistic expression meaning that torture is allowed for a serious purpose, as distinct from torture for pleasure," Margalit comments.

<P>Take the West Bank town of Halhul. In 1979, according to Mayor Muhammad Milhem (later expelled without credible charge with a typical parody of judicial process), the town was placed under a two-week curfew after two young Palestinians were killed by Israeli settlers in response to stones thrown at a bus. In further punishment, the authorities banned a wholesale vegetable and fruit project that was to be the key to the town's development. Several months later, after settlers claimed that stones had been thrown, the inhabitants of the town, including women and children, were held outdoors through a cold rainy night for "interrogation."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT11" HREF="#FN11">11</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>In 1982, a delegation of Labor Alignment leaders, including noted hawks, presented to Prime Minister Menahem Begin detailed accounts of terrorist acts against Arabs, including the collective punishment in Halhul: "The men were taken from their houses beginning at midnight, in pajamas, in the cold. The notables and other men were concentrated in the square of the mosque and held there until morning. Meanwhile men of the Border Guards broke into houses, beating people with shouts and curses. During the many hours that hundreds of people were kept in the mosque square, they were ordered to urinate and excrete on one another and also to sing <I>Hatikva</I> [the Israeli national anthem] and to call out `Long Live the State of Israel.' Several times people were beaten and ordered to crawl on the ground. Some were even ordered to lick the earth. At the same time four trucks were commandeered and at daybreak, the inhabitants were loaded on the trucks, about 100 in each truck, and taken like sheep to the Administration headquarters in Hebron. On Holocaust Day, ...the people who were arrested were ordered to write numbers on their hands with their own hands, in memory of the Jews in the extermination camps."

<P>The report describes torture and humiliation of prisoners by soldiers and settlers allowed into the jails to participate in beatings, brutal treatment of Arabs by settlers, even murder with impunity. There was no reaction, because, as Yoram Peri wrote bitterly, the victims are just "Araboushim" (a term of abuse, comparable to "nigger" or "kike").<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT12" HREF="#FN12">12</A></FONT></SUP> The Hebrew press provides an elaborate record of similar practices over many years.

<P>Within Israel, workers from the territories can expect similar treatment. Under the heading "Uncle Ahmed's Cabin," Yigal Sarna, a few months before the uprising, tells the "story of slavery" of the tens of thousands of unorganized workers who come to Israel each day. "They are slaves, sub-citizens suspected of everything, who dwell under the floor tiles of Tel Aviv, locked up overnight in a hut in the citrus grove of a farm, near sewage dumps, in shelters that...serve rats only" or in underground parking stations or grocery stands in the market, illegally, since they are not permitted to spend the night in Israel, including "slaving children" and others hired at "the slave markets of Ashkelon, Jerusalem, Ramat Gan and other places." A few days later Knesset member Ran Cohen reported the treatment of Arab workers by Border Guards in a Tel Aviv Hotel: "The Arab workers were cruelly beaten up, and were compelled to masturbate before the Border Guards, to lick the floor of their flat and to eat coffee mixed with sugar and tooth paste, and their money was stolen." They brought complaints to the authorities, but after more than two months, there had been no investigation.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT13" HREF="#FN13">13</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The key feature of the occupation has always been humiliation: they must not be allowed to raise their heads. The basic principle, often openly expressed, is that the Araboushim must understand who rules this land and who walks in it with head lowered and eyes averted. If shopkeepers try to open their stores in the afternoon as a gesture of independence, the army compels them to close in the afternoon and open in the morning. If a remote village declares itself "liberated," meaning that it will run its own internal affairs, the army attacks, and if stones are thrown as villagers try to keep the soldiers out, the result will be killings, beatings, destruction of property, mass arrests, torture.

<P>Israeli Arabs too must be constantly wary. An Arab friend drove me one evening from Ramallah to Jerusalem, but asked me to take a taxi to my hotel from his home in East Jerusalem (annexed by Israel in defiance of the UN, while more than doubling the city's area<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT14" HREF="#FN14">14</A></FONT></SUP>) because he might be stopped at a roadblock on returning home, with consequences that might be severe. On a walk in the old city with an Arab friend, he reached up and touched a black flag -- many were hung in mourning after the assassination of PLO leader Khalil Al-Wazir (Abu Jihad) in Tunis by Israeli commandoes. A Border Guard standing nearby whipped out a camera and photographed him, following him with the camera trained on him as we walked on, adding a menacing comment. This man does not frighten easily; he spent years in an Israeli prison, and after his release has been outspoken in advocacy of Palestinian rights. But he requested that we go at once to the nearby Border Guard headquarters to explain what had occurred to an officer he knew; otherwise, he feared, he might be picked up by the police, charged with responsibility for hanging the flags, taken for "interrogation," and dispatched into oblivion. An Israeli friend and I went to the headquarters, where the words "Bruchim Haba'im" ("blessed are those who enter") appear over the doorway; in the light of the (well-deserved) reputation of the Border Guards, one can only imagine the fate of Arabs so blessed. The officer we sought could not be reached at once (he was engaged in wiretapping, we were casually informed), but when he arrived, we explained what had happened and he called the patrol and ordered them to drop the matter. Luckily, there was "protection" in this case.

<P>The pattern is common. Israeli journalist Tom Segev reports what happened when an Arab lawyer told him that a random walk through Jerusalem would yield ample evidence of intimidation and humiliation of Arabs. Skeptical, Segev walked with him through Jerusalem, where he was stopped repeatedly by Border Guards to check his identification papers. One ordered him: "Come here, jump." Laughing, he dropped the papers on the road and ordered the lawyer to pick them up. "These people will do whatever you tell them to do," the Border Guards explained to Segev: "If I tell him to jump, he will jump. Run, he will run. Take your clothes off, he will take them off. If I tell him to kiss the wall he will kiss it. If I tell him to crawl on the road, won't he crawl? ... Everything. Tell him to curse his mother and he will curse her too." They are "not human beings." The Guards then searched the lawyer, slapped him, and ordered him to remove his shoes, warning that they could order him to remove his clothes as well. "My Arab," Segev continues, "kept silent and sat down on the ground" as the Border Guards laughed, saying again "Really, not humans," then walked away. "People were passing by and didn't look at the Arab, as if he were transparent. `Here you have your story', said my Arab." Others are not so fortunate, and may be beaten and taken away for "interrogation" and detention without charge. Complaints to the police evoke still further brutality, as amply documented.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT15" HREF="#FN15">15</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>These are the conditions of daily life for Ahmed, and the background for the uprising.

<P>Avishai Margalit writes that "within the politics of honor and humiliation it is difficult even to talk of a political settlement." That may be true of Israeli society; it is easy to talk of a political settlement among the Palestinians, and its general form is clear enough and widely accepted. There is little point continuing to evade these central facts, as is commonly done, even by the most critical commentators in the United States, for example, Anthony Lewis, who condemns Israel for attempting to deport a Palestinian advocate of nonviolence on grounds that he wants "Israel to end its occupation -- which is the goal long sought by the United States and virtually every other government on earth."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT16" HREF="#FN16">16</A></FONT></SUP> In fact, this is the goal long <I>blocked</I> by the United States and its Israeli Labor Party allies, a goal that has yet to be expressed clearly even by Peace Now after many years of advocacy of a political settlement by the PLO and widely under the occupation.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT17" HREF="#FN17">17</A></FONT></SUP> As long as such illusions persist, nothing will change.


<H3>Some Personal Observations</H3>

<P>I visited in April at the time of the assassination of Abu Jihad, an act generally applauded in Israel, and widely condoned here, on the grounds that he had been involved in planning terrorist acts; on the same grounds, there could be no objection to the assassination of the Israeli and American political leadership. The Gaza strip was entirely sealed off because of protests that led to large-scale killings by the army, and was impossible to enter. But with very helpful Arab contacts, I was able to visit Arab areas of the West Bank. Even before the assassination, the region was coming to resemble a concentration camp. The response is determination and quiet defiance, an impressive level of popular organization, the firm intent to develop a self-sustaining subsistence economy at a mere survival level if necessary, and astonishingly high morale. From leading Palestinian activists, to organizers of popular committees, to people in villages under military control, to victims of army and settler terror, the answers are the same: we will endure, we will suffer, and we will win our independence by making it impossible for the Israelis to maintain their rule.

<P>In the Ramallah hospital, there were many severely injured patients but no doctors to be seen, and few nurses, when I visited. A confrontation with soldiers had taken place a few hours earlier outside the hospital, and the medical staff risk detention if they attempt to assist the wounded. Patients and families were at first reluctant to speak to us, wary that we might be Israeli agents masquerading as journalists. After our guide had established his credentials, they were willing to do so, describing the circumstances in which they were beaten and shot. One man, paralyzed from the waist down, with tubes coming out of his body and five bullet wounds, told us softly as we left his bedside that "If you have need of a homeland, you must sacrifice." A 13-year-old boy, hit by a "rubber bullet" (a rubber-encased steel bullet), told us that he had been shot while returning home from a mosque and trying to leave the scene of a demonstration nearby. Asked how he felt, he replied that his mood was "higher than the wind." The sentiments are common, expressed without rhetoric or anger; people lacking means of self-defense, having endured much suffering and facing more, have stars in their eyes, and a sense of inevitable victory. In contrast, in Israel, at least among those segments of the population that are aware of what is happening, there is a sense of foreboding. One very close friend of forty years asked me, after I had given a talk at Tel Aviv University on the current situation, whether I thought Israeli Jews would still be there in twenty years. The mood in the territories, and the sense that they can survive the mounting repression until the occupation ends and independence is achieved, may or may not be realistic, but it was readily apparent.

<P>On Friday morning, with businesses closed, the city of Nablus was quiet, though Israeli troops were patrolling, in preparation for an expected demonstration after prayers at the mosque. At the outskirts of the city, a group of men and boys were clearing a field by hand for subsistence crops. The United National Leadership had designated this day for preparing a self-sustaining economy, not reliant on Israel, which has converted the territories into a market for Israeli products and a source of cheap labor. No serious effort has been made to organize mass refusals to work in Israel, because the dependence of the terrorities on this work for survival has not yet been overcome. One of the organizers, a municipal clerk, guided us to an apartment in the old city of Nablus, where we were joined by another local activist, a taxi driver. With its maze of narrow winding paths, the old city cannot be patrolled by the army, which has erected heavy steel doors at the gates so that the population can be locked in if need be. The two men described the network of popular committees, organized by neighborhood and function (health, production, municipal services, women's groups, etc.), that run the affairs of the city and social life, receiving regular directives from the United Leadership on general policy matters, with specific days designated for particular kinds of activities, to be carried out as the local communities determine.

<P>Such popular organizations have been developing for years through the initiative of the (illegal) Communist Party, which has long emphasized popular organization rather than "armed struggle" and may have gained considerable credibility by the now-evident success of this strategy, and the various factions of the PLO, particularly its dominant element Fatah. Their emergence and development in the past few months is the most striking feature of the popular uprising, with long-term significance. Shulamith Hareven observes that the uprising is "not merely a protest against Israeli power, though this is the basic and most obvious component." It is "a revolt of women and youth against traditional patriarchal authority," against "women's work" and the "prosperous elders, with their connections to Israel and foreign countries," in "a society where something very important is proceeding and changing before our eyes, and even if the current disturbances will be quelled, the process will continue." Reporting from West Bank villages, Zvi Gilat describes their "socialist autonomy," with mutual aid, provisions distributed to those in need and popular organization despite Israeli terror, always at hand, as in Ya'bed, where villagers listen all night to "the prisoners crying out and asking for food" from the local school, converted (as many schools have been) to a "prison camp."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT18" HREF="#FN18">18</A></FONT></SUP> One sees the signs everywhere.

<P>Though Arab police have resigned under orders of the United Leadership, there is, local inhabitants say, virtually no crime or disorder, apart from confrontations with the occupying forces. In Nablus, plans are underway to raise chickens and rabbits, and to farm on the outskirts. The party structure emerges at the level of the United Leadership (Fatah, the Popular Front, the Democratic Front, the Communist Party, and in Gaza, the Islamic Jihad). It appears to be less significant, though it doubtless functions, at the local level.

<P>The primary emphasis and concern is organization of community life, with a view towards creating the basis for full independence. The political goal is to end the occupation. When questions turn to the means for achieving this end, the answer is always the same: these matters are to be negotiated with the PLO. There was informed criticism of the PLO for incompetence, corruption, and worse, and thinly-veiled contempt for several of the figures in Israel regarded by the media as leaders and official spokesmen, though not all; Faisal Husseini, director of the Arab Studies Society in East Jerusalem, now again under administrative detention, was mentioned with particular respect.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT19" HREF="#FN19">19</A></FONT></SUP> But the Palestinian issue is understood as a national problem, and the PLO is the national leadership, whatever its faults. It is a fair guess that if independence is achieved, conflicts submerged in the unity of resistance will surface, particularly now that local organization has achieved substantial scale and success.

<P>The activities outlined by local organizers corresponded closely to a thoughtful analysis by Bashir Barghouti, an influential West Bank intellectual. His vision, presented with detail and a long-term perspective, is that an independent life will be established, whatever measures Israel takes to prevent it, with eventual political independence after the occupation becomes too costly for Israel to maintain. The network of popular organizations, and their activities to establish self-sufficiency and self-government, will provide the basis for the social and political structure of a West Bank-Gaza state, established alongside of Israel. Whether the plans are realistic and the prospects realizable, I do not know, but the similarity of perception and intent over a wide range is as noteworthy as the spirit of dedication and the ongoing efforts -- and the resemblance to earlier Zionist history.

<P>One of the first villages to declare itself liberated was Salfit, which resisted army conquest until three days before my visit. The local committees "had organized municipal services, including sanitation, as an alternative to those provided by the Civil Administration" and had "posted guards and patrols to warn of the arrival of settlers and the army," the <CITE>Jerusalem Post</CITE> reported in its brief notice of the army assault.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT20" HREF="#FN20">20</A></FONT></SUP> The story of Salfit was recounted to us in the home of Rajeh al-Salfiti, a well-known nationalist figure and folk singer, who had been arrested by the British during the Palestine revolt of 1936-9, by the Jordanians when they ruled the West Bank, and by the Israelis after their conquest. According to his account, related in vivid detail and amplified by several visitors, he was one of 80 people arrested when Israel occupied the town with some 1500 troops in a pre-dawn attack, then released with two others (one seriously ill, one disabled). The town has a dominant Communist party presence, and was well-organized. Earlier army attempts to break in had been beaten back by rock-throwing demonstrators; quite commonly, the confrontations that are reported, and those that are not, develop in this manner. At first, the army assumed that the attempt at self-rule could be overcome by sporadic terror. One man described how two Israeli sharpshooters in civilian clothes climbed to the roof of a building at the outskirts of the town and shot a person in the streets chosen at random, after which the killer called to his partner that they could now leave. Neither this nor subsequent efforts succeeded. The village remained united in resistance, running its own affairs.

<P>On one occasion, in late March, the army did break into the town on the pretext of rescuing a tourist bus that had been hijacked, killing a 14-year-old boy and "rescuing" the bus and its occupants. But this tale was quickly exposed as a fabrication. The travellers were a group of American academics attending a conference organized by Bir Zeit university (closed by the army, as was the entire school and university system). They were visiting the town, where they were welcomed by the local inhabitants. One of those "rescued" (well after the bus had left the town) was Harvard professor Zachary Lockman, who reported that a helicopter had been observing the village during the visit and that he had overheard an army officer tell his commander by radio that the group "had not been under any threat whatsoever."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT21" HREF="#FN21">21</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>When the town was finally occupied by the army assault, we were told, soldiers entered the mosque and desecrated it and one climbed the minaret where he called out in Arabic "Your God is gone, we are in charge here," a further exercise of humiliation. The same has been reported elsewhere, for example, in Beit Ummar, where more than 100 windows of the mosque were broken, holy books and other property destroyed, and tape recordings of Koran readings stolen during a five-hour army rampage with bulldozers that severely damaged virtually every building along the main street, destroyed cars and tractors, uprooted trees and caused general havoc.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT22" HREF="#FN22">22</A></FONT></SUP> In Salfit, union offices were destroyed and other buildings damaged. The army entered houses identified by number to seek people designated for arrest; it was speculated that helicopter flights in the preceding days may have been aimed at providing detailed maps. In prison, those arrested were subjected to beatings in the normal fashion. As we were about to leave the village, we heard boys shouting outside that the soldiers were coming. People were streaming from the houses, including women and children, to confront the soldiers once again. Morale evidently remained unshaken, three days after the army assault. My Arab guides did not want to be apprehended in the town, so we left in another direction. No attack was reported in the press, and what happened, I do not know.

<P>I joined several lawyers from the Ramallah human rights group Al-Haq (Law in the Service of Man) on a visit to the village of Beita, closed under military blockade that bars all contact with the outside world; gas, water and electricity were cut off, and there were shortages of milk, flour and vegetables.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT23" HREF="#FN23">23</A></FONT></SUP> We reached Beita over a back road and hills, guided by a man from a neighboring village, and stayed until just before 7PM, when the military closure is extended to curfew, meaning house arrest. As we left, the back road over the hills had been blocked with boulders to protect the village from possible settler or army attack.

<P>Beita achieved notoriety when a Jewish teenager, Tirza Porat, was killed on April 6 by an Israeli settler, Romam Aldubi, after a confrontation that took place when 20 hikers from the religious-nationalist settlement of Elon Moreh entered the lands of Beita -- "to show who are the masters," as one hiker later told a TV interviewer. Two villagers, Mousa Saleh Bani Shamseh and Hatem Fayez Ahmad al-Jaber (there are conflicting versions of their names), were also killed and several were severely wounded by Aldubi, one of two armed guards accompanying the hikers. Aldubi is a well-known extremist barred from entering Nablus, the only Jew ever subjected to an army exclusion order; the second guard and organizer of the hike, Menahem Ilan, also had a criminal past. A 16-year-old boy, Issam Abdul Halim Mohammad Said, was killed by soldiers the following day.

<P>The hikers claimed that Tirza Porat had been killed by Arab villagers, setting off virtual hysteria in Israel, including a call by two cabinet ministers to destroy the town and deport its population. Within a day, the army had determined that she was killed by Aldubi, then proceeding to blow up 14 houses while Chief of Staff Dan Shomron reported that "the Arab residents had intended no harm to the Elon Moreh hikers" and had indeed protected them. Many people were arrested (60 remained in prison when we visited), and six were later deported. General Shomron declared that "action had to be immediate. A failure to act could well have led to other action in the area," that is, more settler violence. The collective punishment and expulsions are "the expected tribute" paid to control the settlers, Nahum Barnea observes, punishment for their violence being out of the question, because they are Jews.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT24" HREF="#FN24">24</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Beita is -- or was -- a lovely, quiet village, tucked away in the hills not far from Ramallah. A traditional and conservative village, Beita had declared itself liberated shortly after the uprising began and was attacked several times by the army, leading to stone-throwing confrontations on the road to the village, which the army blockaded. During one army raid on February 14, property was destroyed and three villagers had to be hospitalized with broken limbs: two teenagers, and an 80-year-old man with an arm, two fingers and two ribs broken.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT25" HREF="#FN25">25</A></FONT></SUP> All this being normal, the town remained enveloped in obscurity.

<P>What took place on April 6 is contested. According to villagers, the lands of Beita were under military closure at the time. They were concerned when they saw settlers entering these lands and approaching a well, which they feared the settlers might be planning to poison or destroy; that has happened elsewhere according to local inhabitants, including Ya'bed, where the well was blown up by Jewish settlers.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT26" HREF="#FN26">26</A></FONT></SUP> When Mousa Saleh was murdered by Aldubi in the fields, villagers brought the hikers to the village to determine what should be done. Aldubi killed his second victim when he approached with hands raised to ask Aldubi to hand over his weapon and take the hikers on their way. Aldubi killed Tirza Porat after he was hit by stones thrown by Mousa Saleh's mother and sister. His rifle was then taken from him and destroyed. Settler tales about shooting by Arabs are denied by the army, which issued an official report of dubious accuracy. Israeli friends in Jerusalem told me that they had no doubt, from the first television interviews, that the hikers were lying. Though the hikers were under the control of the inhabitants for several hours after the killings, none were injured, and they were cared for by villagers, as the army emphasized in an effort to calm the hysteria that followed these events.

<P>The official claim was that the villagers were given ample warning of the house demolitions so that they could remove their possessions. That is plainly false. 10 days later, villagers were still rummaging through the ruins, searching for pieces of broken furniture, clothes, and stored food that had been buried in the explosions. According to several independent accounts, the villagers had been gathered in the mosque and given 15 minutes notice of the demolitions. We were told that one man was indeed given time to move his possessions to his father's home, after which both houses were demolished. These are substantial stone houses; one of those partially destroyed was a two-story building which, we were told, was more than 100 years old. Apart from the 14 houses officially destroyed, 16 others were damaged, many unlivable. I noticed one house with a wall caved in by a concrete block about ten feet long that had sailed some fifteen feet from the nearest demolished structure.

<P>The International Commission of Jurists in Geneva denounced the collective punishments, including the demolitions and expulsions, as yet another violation of the 1949 Geneva conventions. Polls indicate that 21% of Israeli Jews opposed demolition of the houses and 13% called for the entire village to be "erased."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT27" HREF="#FN27">27</A></FONT></SUP> Some commentary condemned the demolition of the house of a man who had aided the hikers, but I saw no general condemnation in the mainstream press, and no call for collective punishment against Elon Moreh after settler provocation led to Aldubi's killings.

<P>As elsewhere, the villagers described what had happened, and their current plight, with calm and simplicity. They are prepared to endure. Their responses were considered and thoughtful. Asked how they would react if Israelis were to offer to rebuild the houses that had been destroyed (16 of which were damaged or destroyed "illegally" even by the standards of what passes for law in the territories), they responded, after consultation, that it would have to be a political decision: if Jews would come to rebuild in a spirit of friendship and solidarity, they would be welcome; if they intended only to salve their consciences or improve the image of "the beautiful Israel," the villagers would have none of it. I raised the question of rebuilding the houses "illegally" destroyed with several Peace Now intellectuals in Jerusalem and was told that the matter was under consideration, but I know of no outcome.

<P>It was raining steadily when we visited Beita. Women were trying to cook outdoors in the rain, others in semi-demolished houses. A house may have a dozen or more inhabitants. The number of people left homeless is considerable, apart from the many arrested and deported. Mousa Saleh's mother and sister, three months pregnant, are in prison, their homes destroyed. The sister has been charged with assault, and according to Israeli reports, may be charged with complicity in the murder of Tirza Porat.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT28" HREF="#FN28">28</A></FONT></SUP> As for Aldubi, he is not to be charged, because, as the army spokesman said, "I believe the tragic incident and its result are already a penalty" -- for the murderer, that is, not the Araboushim who raise their heads.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT29" HREF="#FN29">29</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Of the victims of the events in Beita, only the name of Tirza Porat is known, and only the circumstances of her killing merit inquiry and comment. This is only to be expected in the reigning climate both here and in Israel. Who would have heard the name of Intissar al-Atar, a 17-year-old Palestinian girl shot and killed in a schoolyard in Gaza last November 10, or of her killer, Shimon Yifrah of the Jewish settlement of Gush Katif in the Gaza Strip, arrested a month later and released on bail because, the Supreme Court determined, "the offense is not severe enough to order the arrest of the accused, and in this case there is no fear that Yifrah will repeat the offense or escape from his punishment"? Or of Jude Abdallah Awad, a shepherd murdered, his companion severely wounded, when a Jewish settler tried to drive them from a field on May 5, an incident meriting 80 words in the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> (and none when the settler was released on bail, charged with manslaughter)? Or Iyad Mohammed Aqel, a 15-year-old boy murdered by Israeli soldiers, his head "beaten to a pulp" according to a witness, after he was dragged from his home in a Gaza refugee camp?<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT30" HREF="#FN30">30</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The reaction here and in Israel to the grossly discriminatory treatment of Arabs and Jews by the courts stands alongside the prevailing double standard on terror and rights. Palestinian artist Fathi Ghaban receives a six-month prison sentence for using the colors of the Palestinian flag in a painting. An Arab worker caught sleeping illegally in Tel Aviv receives the same sentence, with two-months additional imprisonment if he does not pay a heavy fine. Four young Arabs are sentenced to fines and three months at hard labor for having waved a Palestinian flag in a protest demonstration after the Sabra-Shatila massacres. In contrast, a sergeant who ordered two soldiers to bury four Palestinians alive with a bulldozer receives four months, and two soldiers, whose prolonged beating of captured Palestinians horrified Europe after a CBS filming, received three months probation. Another soldier received a month's suspended sentence for killing an Arab by firing into a village. A settler found guilty of shooting directly into a crowd of demonstrators was sentenced to a rebuke; another received six months of "public service" outside prison for killing a 13-year-old boy after an incident on a road in which he was under no danger according to testimony of army observers. President Herzog reduced the sentences of Jewish terrorists who murdered 3 Palestinians and wounded 33 in a gun and grenade attack at Hebron Islamic College from life in prison to 15 years; further reductions are doubtless to come. Three other members of the terrorist underground were released after 2 years in prison for the attempted murder of two West Bank mayors, one of whom had his legs blown off, while a military court sentenced two Arabs from Kafr Kassem, the scene of one of Israel's worst massacres in 1956, to 21 years imprisonment for allegedly planting two bombs that exploded with no injuries. The ideologist and second highest leader of the Jewish terrorist underground, Yehuda Etzion, convicted of planning the bombing of the Dome of the Rock, organizing the attack on the mayors and other atrocities, and stealing 600kg of explosives from a military base, was released to a religious school in Afula after serving half of a ten year sentence, and a presidential pardon is under consideration. Palestinian storekeepers are threatened with the same sentence -- five years in prison -- "if they failed to wash anti-Israeli graffiti off their buildings and remove Palestinian flags," wire services report.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT31" HREF="#FN31">31</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Such practices have been an unrecognized scandal since the founding of the state. One revealing example is the case of Shmuel Lahis, who murdered several dozen Arab civilians he was guarding in a mosque in the undefended Lebanese village of Hula in 1948. He was sentenced to seven years in prison, immediately amnestied, and granted a lawyer's licence on the grounds that the act carried "no stigma." Later he was appointed Secretary-General of the Jewish Agency, the highest executive position in the World Zionist Organization, with no qualms, since his amnesty "denies the punishment and the charge as well." The record was exposed when Lahis was appointed Secretary-General, eliciting little interest in Israel, and none here.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT32" HREF="#FN32">32</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>After the assassination of Abu Jihad, curfews were extended to new areas of the West Bank, among them, the Kalandia refugee camp near Jerusalem. We were able to enter through a back road, not yet barricaded, and to spend about half an hour there before being apprehended by Israeli troops. The town was silent, with no one in the streets apart from a funeral procession permitted by the army and a few young children who approached us, surely assuming we were Israelis, chanting the common slogan "PLO, Israel No." In the streets we found signs of recent demonstrations: metal remnants of the firing of "rubber bullets," a tear gas canister made by Federal Laboratories in Saltsburg Pennsylvania, with the warning, still legible, that it is for use only by "trained personnel" and that fire, death or injury may result from improper use, a common occurrence. While we were being interrogated, a man who looked perhaps 90 years old hobbled out of a doorway with his hands outstretched, pleading that he was hungry. He was unceremoniously ordered back indoors. No one else was to be seen. The soldiers were primarily concerned that we might be journalists, and expelled us from the camp without incident.

<P>Most of the participants in an international academic conference I was attending in Israel joined a demonstration at the Dahariya prison near Hebron, organized by several of the peace groups, mostly new, that have sprung up in the past several months. These represent the most hopeful development within Israel, and American support for them could make a real difference.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT33" HREF="#FN33">33</A></FONT></SUP> Unlike Peace Now, which remains unwilling to separate itself clearly from Labor Party rejectionism, they are forthright in calling for an end to the occupation, and committed to find ways to protest it. Approach to the prison and the nearby village was blocked by troops, but women and children, later men as well, gathered on hills several hundred yards away and began to call back and forth with the demonstrators. A few children drifted towards us, followed by many others and finally adults as well. At the end, a man from the village took the microphone and thanked us for having come. A young man wanted to speak as well, but was persuaded not to. A few days before, he had carried away the body of his brother, killed by soldiers, and he showed us scars from beatings he had received the preceding day. There was concern over the consequences for him after we left, a problem elsewhere as well. While foreigners were present, soldiers were well-behaved, but there was a good deal of concern, on all sides, about what would happen later to Arabs they found us visiting or speaking to. As we left Dahariya, children were carrying our signs, waving and shouting. What happened afterwards, I do not know.

<P>Four days later, according to the signed affidavit of an army reservist, young Palestinians were kicked and beaten with plastic pipes and handcuffs while their commander looked on as they were brought, bound and blindfolded, to Dahariya prison. One boy 12 to 15 years old who had been crying was raked along barbed wire, thrown against a wall, kicked and beaten with a club by a soldier and jailer while he screamed with pain -- facts too insignificant for report or comment in the Newspaper of Record.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT34" HREF="#FN34">34</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The Dahariya prison, known as "the slaughterhouse" among prisoners, is a way station to the new prison camp Ansar III in the Negev desert close to the Egyptian border. Ansar I was a hideous torture chamber established by Israel during the Lebanon war for Lebanese and Palestinians taken hostage. Ansar II is a prison camp established in Gaza, with a similar reputation.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT35" HREF="#FN35">35</A></FONT></SUP> Ansar III follows suit. Prisoners include "a significant segment of the Palestinian elite," the <CITE>Washington Post</CITE> reports: doctors, lawyers, trade union officials, students, and university officials, at least 20 journalists, and others. They are denied water, edible food, medical attention, even an opportunity to wash for many weeks. They are subjected to such collective punishments as lying with hands bound behind the back for long periods in the scorching desert sun, forced to walk in single file with heads lowered, denied newspapers, books, mail or stationary, or the opportunity to walk about freely or change clothes, sometimes for over a month. They have no names, only numbers, part of an effort to create a "sense of isolation" according to prisoners, no doubt on the advice of psychologists. There are no charges or judicial review. Families are not informed of where they are, why they were imprisoned or for how long. Journalists, even lawyers, have been denied entry.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT36" HREF="#FN36">36</A></FONT></SUP> All of this again falls under the category of humiliation, a pedagogic device to ensure that they do not raise their heads.

<P>According to Knesset Member Dedi Zucker of the Citizen's Rights Party, confidential government documents report that there are 10,000 Arabs in jail, half arrested during the uprising; close to 2000 are under six-month (renewable) preventive detention.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT37" HREF="#FN37">37</A></FONT></SUP> Moderates are particularly vulnerable. They are always the most dangerous, because they raise the threat of political settlement. At Dahariya, each demonstrator asked to see a particular prisoner. In my case, the prisoner was Gaza Attorney Muhammed Abu-Sha'ban, placed under administrative detention for 6 months immediately after he spoke at Tel Aviv University where he called for dialogue and political settlement. There are many similar cases. Five Jewish editors of the Israeli journal <CITE>Derech Hanitzotz</CITE> were arrested and the journal banned, the first time that Israel's draconian censorship laws have been applied to ban a Hebrew Israeli journal; they were denied access to lawyers, police raided the office of one attorney to confiscate files, and two face charges of association with hostile elements that carry up to 40 years in prison.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT38" HREF="#FN38">38</A></FONT></SUP> The sister journal in Arabic was also banned. In an affidavit circulated by Amnesty International, its editor, Ribhi al-Aruri, reports that he was taken to the interrogation center in Jerusalem, beaten and kicked for an hour, handcuffed with a sack over his head, interrogated for days while deprived of sleep and food, placed finally in a "cupboard" that permits only standing and kept there for an entire day, then again for two full days without food. He was allowed to see a lawyer only ten days after his arrest, then placed under six-month detention without trial. This case, far from the worst, is known only because he was adopted as an AI Prisoner of Conscience on grounds that his detention appears to be "on account of the non-violent exercise of his right to freedom of expression and association."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT39" HREF="#FN39">39</A></FONT></SUP> If the editor of the pro-contra journal <CITE>La Prensa</CITE> had been subjected to a fraction of the same treatment in a country under attack by the superpower that funds the journal, the story might have made the press.


<H3>Elsewhere under Occupation</H3>

<P>Other areas under curfew were only visible from the road, over barriers erected by the army. When I visited, the refugee camp of Jalazoun had been under 24-hour curfew for over a month. Jalazoun was a ghost town. No men were to be seen. A few older women, presumably less vulnerable, were working in gardens near the houses and there were several children out of doors. Otherwise, silence. All entrances were barricaded and under military guard. The inhabitants were not permitted to leave their houses except for a brief period every few days to purchase food with what meager resources they still have. There was reported to be very little medical care and a shortage of medicines. The UN relief official in charge of the camp, Mogens Fokdal, reports that "people have gone without electricity for a month. They have no oil or fuel to cook. They are starting to burn old shoes and furniture to make fires. The situation is deteriorating every day." UN garbage trucks had been barred by the army from entering the camp since the curfew was declared on March 16. UN officials had urged the people in the camp to burn garbage to prevent disease, "but they fear the soldiers will see the fires as a demonstration," Fokdal explained, a risk they cannot take. Inhabitants said they had no food except bread and what is left from supplies stored before the curfew. On April 17, Israeli soldiers turned back a UN convoy carrying food and other supplies to the camp. Soldiers at the camp entrance deny that there are shortages.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT40" HREF="#FN40">40</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>According to Attorney Raja Shehadeh of Al-Haq, the curfew was imposed after an alleged threat to an Israeli collaborator. Israel takes such threats very seriously. Typically, the "threat" consists of calls on the collaborators, who are well-known because of their flaunting of privileges afforded for their services, to come to the mosque, repent, and promise to refrain from serving as Shin Beit informers. One result of the uprising is that Israel appears to have lost its network of collaborators and informers.

<P>The village of Biddu was placed under curfew on March 7 after a collaborator was approached to ask him to repent. In retaliation, the army cut off water and electricity for 2 weeks in this town of 15,000 people and demolished four houses.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT41" HREF="#FN41">41</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>On April 24 and May 14, the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> mentioned the killing by soldiers of two more nameless victims in Qabatiya, without, however, recalling the recent history of this village. Qabatiya was under military control, with all entry and exit blocked, from February 24 to April 1. Water, electricity, food supplies and medicines were cut off in this village of about 15,000 people. There was still no electricity when the village was visited by a North American delegation on April 25. On February 24, villagers had marched to the house of a collaborator, Mohammad Al-Ayed, to call upon him to repent. Al-Ayed, who like other Israeli collaborators was permitted to bear arms, began shooting wildly and continued for several hours, killing a 4-year-old boy and wounding 15 people. He then either killed himself (as villagers allege), or was killed by villagers. His body was hung on an electric pole.

<P>The army then invaded the village, killing a 20-day-old child and a 70-year-old man with tear gas. Dozens of people had bones broken from beatings. Many were arrested; 500 remained under arrest when the curfew was lifted 6 weeks later. Four houses were demolished and others heavily damaged. During the curfew, villagers report, soldiers entered the village daily, arresting and beating people, breaking into homes, smashing furniture and destroying food supplies. When journalist Oren Cohen entered by back roads in late March, the smell of tear gas made it difficult to breathe. A house where he stayed had signs of a fire, caused a week earlier by gas grenades dropped from a helicopter, the family reported. Food and medicines were in short supply, the one clinic and pharmacy had been closed, and the town's only doctor could not handle the many patients.

<P>The visiting delegation were told by villagers that morale improved as the curfew was extended and the community organized in response. One said: "If you want to balance the situation -- on the one hand put all the Israeli practices: torture, hunger, beating, imprisonment. We are ready to accept them, but not to accept occupation. We would rather continue if that is the way to get rid of the occupation." Having heard the same things said with obvious sincerity and simplicity, I do not find it hard to believe that the sentiment is genuine. The villagers returned to the subsistence economy of earlier generations, reopening old wells, eating bread and wild greens, finding wood for cooking in place of kerosene. What most impressed the delegation was "the consistently bouyant and determined spirit" in Qabatiya, as elsewhere in the territories (my observation as well). Journalists who managed to enter Qabatiya agreed. Joel Greenberg of the <CITE>Jerusalem Post,</CITE> visiting just hours before the press was banned from the territories completely, found the people "surprisingly resilient" and "defiant" after a month of the curfew, and without remorse over the fate of the collaborator, who "was morally degenerate, hated by everyone, and was only attacked after he fired on what was a peaceful march, they said." They are prepared to survive on herbs from the hills if necessary. Hugh Schofield reported in the Canadian press that soldiers manning roadblocks at the town entrances were turning away supplies of food and fuel; much of the town's agricultural land had been placed off limits; the town was forbidden to export to Jordan from its stone quarry, employing half the workforce; and of course workers were forbidden to travel to jobs in Israel, leaving the town without economic resources. "The residents' spirits are strangely high," he reported: "If the aim of the Israeli measures is to cow the locals, the effect is, if anything, the opposite."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT42" HREF="#FN42">42</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>On May 11, 47 villagers were charged with the killing of Al-Ayed, including one man carried to court by his neighbors, paralyzed from the waist down as a result of Al-Ayed's shooting into the crowd.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT43" HREF="#FN43">43</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Few people in Israel seemed aware of these and many similar events in the territories. The killings and dreadful beatings, sometimes reported, do not give an accurate picture of Israeli repression or the goals and achievements of the uprising.


<H3>The Political Prospects</H3>

<P>The uprising was not anticipated by the Israeli authorities, and it is possible that they understand very little about it. Thus if Abu Jihad was assassinated "because army and intelligence officials believed he was directing the uprising," as reported, then we are observing yet another failure of the much-overpraised Israeli intelligence services.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT44" HREF="#FN44">44</A></FONT></SUP> In 1973, the Egyptian-Syrian attack on their territories occupied by Israel was unexpected, and its early successes came as an enormous shock. Israel had dismissed Sadat's warnings about the consequences of Israel's rejection of a peace treaty and its settlement of the northeastern Sinai, even the maneuvers of the Egyptian army, on the assumption that "war is not the Arabs' game," as Israelis were assured by former director of military intelligence and Arabist General Yehoshaphat Harkabi, and many other experts.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT45" HREF="#FN45">45</A></FONT></SUP> The collapse of this myth caused a severe psychological shock. The same occurred in 1982, when Israel's forces proved ineffectual against fixed Syrian defensive positions during the invasion of Lebanon, and particularly after the war, when Israel was driven from large areas of Lebanon by unanticipated resistance, causing losses that Israel was unwilling to absorb. But, it was confidently explained, these are fanatic Shi'ites, unlike Ahmed in Gaza and the West Bank, docile and controllable. The uprising has shattered this myth as well, again creating shock waves in Israel.

<P>The pattern is common. In another recent case, until the U.S. Embassy in Tegucigalpa was attacked by angry crowds in April, U.S. authorities ignored the rising anger over their treatment of Honduras as a docile client, including the landing of the 82nd Airborne, bitterly denounced across a wide spectrum within the country.

<P>The point is that repression and domination breed racist contempt as a mechanism of self-defense; how can the oppressor justify to himself what he does, if the victims are human beings? Racist contempt in turn breeds ignorance, and compels the resort to violence when the Ahmeds of the world finally explode in anger and resentment.

<P>While I was in Israel in April, headlines in the Hebrew press reported yet another endorsement of partition by Yasser Arafat, referring explicitly to the <I>principle</I> of a two-state political settlement, not the borders of 40 years ago. The next day, Defense Minister Rabin of the Labor Party announced that Palestinians must be excluded from any political settlement, and that diplomacy can proceed only "on a state-to-state level." In Jerusalem, Thomas Friedman managed to miss these facts once again, and following the practice that won him a Pulitzer Prize, reported 4 days later that the problem remains the PLO, still unwilling to consider a diplomatic settlement because "the minute Mr. Arafat makes a decision about entering into direct negotiations with Israel" -- as he has been offering for years -- "the unity of the Palestinian uprising will explode." Earlier, he had falsely reported that Peace Now "has expressed support for an independent Palestinian state." A few days before Arafat's latest call for a diplomatic settlement, Prime Minister Shamir had informed George Shultz that "UN Resolution 242 does not contain territorial provisions with regard to Jordan," meaning that it excludes the West Bank. At the end of April, the Labor Party once again adopted a campaign platform rejecting Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories, and Rabin clarified that the plan was to allow 60% of the West Bank and Gaza Strip to be part of a Jordanian-Palestinian state, with its capital in Amman. In Jordan in early April, Shultz announced that the PLO or others "who have committed acts of terrorism" must be excluded from peace talks, which would leave the bargaining table quite empty. He also "explained his understanding of the aspirations of Palestinians," <CITE>Times</CITE> reporter Elaine Sciolino wrote, by citing the example of the United States, where he, Shultz, is a Californian, and George Bush is a Texan, but they have no problem living in harmony, so the Palestinian aspirations into which he shows such profound insight can be handled the same way.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT46" HREF="#FN46">46</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Official doctrine remains that the U.S. and the Israeli Labor Party seek peace, blocked by the extremists on all sides. The fact that this pretense can persist without challenge is evidence of our failure to exploit the opportunity afforded by the Palestinian uprising.

<P>Despite everything, Israel remains, in many ways, a very appealing and attractive place, particularly -- as elsewhere -- in its community of dissidents, who are by no means marginal, and could become a significant force with American support. Alone, Palestinian courage and determination will not suffice; with the solidarity of others, it can lead the way to a better future.

<H3>Setting the Stage</H3>

<P>By a slim majority, the House on February 3 rejected a Reagan administration request to renew US government (USG) aid to the proxy army. CIA supply flights into Nicaragua are to continue through February, probably at peak intensity, while the illegal surveillance flights are subject to no limits. Contra supporters and fund-raisers (Robert Dole, General John Singlaub, etc.) announced that they would renew their efforts, reporting that they were "swamped by offers of money and support" after the congressional vote.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT1" HREF="#FN1">1</A></SUP></FONT> The private and clandestine networks may be reactivated, to be exposed years hence with appropriate laments.

<P>The Reagan administration had prepared for the contingency. After the August 7 accords were signed, CIA flights increased to 2-3 a day to provide a reserve stock of arms and supplies. In November, John Negroponte was appointed Deputy National Security Advisor. Closely associated with Honduran General Alvarez, who presided over mounting state terror as the US role deepened, Negroponte was the proconsul for Honduras from 1981-85, charged with converting Honduras into a base for the US attack against Nicaragua and organizing the proxy army.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT2" HREF="#FN2">2</A></SUP></FONT> With this appointment, the administration signalled its intent to return to clandestine war if necessary; Congress and the media were silent.

<P>On February 4, a headline in the Managua newspaper <CITE>El Nuevo Diario</CITE> read: "Peace gains points." The headline is accurate, as was the headline in the Sandinista press stating that "the U.S. Administration Will Evaluate New Forms of Aggression Today." Leaders of the pro-contra internal opposition in Managua deplored the congressional vote as a "Sandinista victory."<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT3" HREF="#FN3">3</A></SUP></FONT>

<P>In <CITE>Zeta</CITE>, January, I reviewed the steps taken by the USG through the first phase of the accords (August-November) to ensure their collapse. The first category was military, including rapid escalation of the supply and surveillance flights required to keep the US proxy forces in the field and to provide them with up-to-the minute intelligence so that they can avoid military combat and attack "soft targets" such as agricultural cooperatives. The goals were to refute the charge of the doves that the resort to violence "is a clear failure" and should be replaced by other measures to "enforce" a desired "regional arrangement" upon Nicaragua, and Nicaragua alone (Tom Wicker)<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT4" HREF="#FN4">4</A></SUP></FONT>; to compel Nicaragua to keep up its guard so that the media could then denounce Sandinista totalitarianism; and to ensure the contras sufficient supplies to continue the war in the event of a ban on official aid. One measure of these successes is that contra forces, according to Western military observers, are able to continue fighting for perhaps a year even without new aid.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT5" HREF="#FN5">5</A></SUP></FONT> Another is given by a Witness for Peace study, which passed virtually without notice, concluding that "Contra rebels have doubled their attacks on civilians" since August 1987, with 90 attacks on civilians as compared with 41 cases of "Contra ambushes, murders, attacks on farm cooperatives and kidnappings between January and July of last year," citing figures and noting that this "provides but a glimpse of the terror unleashed on the civilian population in recent months."<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT6" HREF="#FN6">6</A></SUP></FONT> The press did report that at least 25 more civilians were killed by the contras as the House voted.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT7" HREF="#FN7">7</A></SUP></FONT>

<P>The second category of USG initiatives, ideological warfare at home, included efforts to refashion the accords to fit the USG agenda, a task assigned to the Free Press. Particularly notable during the period reviewed was the evasion of the severe violations of the accords by the US client states, and more crucially, the virtual suppression of the rapid increase in supply flights that undermined what the accords identify as the single "indispensable element" for peace, namely an end to any form of support for "irregular forces [the contras] or insurrectionist movements [indigenous guerrillas]."

<P>There are two major reasons why these facts had to be suppressed: first, they demonstrate that the US bears primary responsibility for sabotaging the accords; second, they undermine the pretense of "symmetry" between El Salvador and Nicaragua that is a staple of USG propaganda, constantly relayed by the media. The careful reader could finally learn that CIA flights had increased so substantially since August that the contras are "burying the equipment in their areas of operation enabling them to fight even if US military air drops cease." This November 24 report merited notice in the <CITE>Washington Post</CITE> on a back page, but the facts apparently do not suggest that the USG may be undermining the accords, or raise questions about the relation between these determined sabotage efforts and the Nicaraguan emergency regulations while the country is under foreign attack. Few, however, would be aware that the International Commission of Verification (CIVS) established under the accords concluded that amnesty need not be decreed until the aggression ceases, and even a real media addict would not have learned last November that the Nicaraguan National Assembly decreed a complete amnesty and revoked the state of emergency, both laws to "go into effect on the date that the [CIVS certifies] compliance with" the commitments of the accords to terminate the attack against Nicaragua -- laws formulated in terms of the simultaneity condition of the accords.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT8" HREF="#FN8">8</A></SUP></FONT> Thus by November, Nicaragua had largely complied with the accords as they are actually written, and remains alone in this regard apart from Costa Rica.

<P>The US military attack against Nicaragua will no doubt continue, along with other measures to restore Nicaragua to the "Central American mode" and to compel it to adhere to "regional standards" as demanded by <CITE>Washington Post</CITE> editors and other doves. Ideological warfare will enter a new phase. In the past, the task of the Free Press was to demonize the Sandinistas while extolling the terror states established and supported by the USG; to suppress Nicaragua's efforts to maintain a neutralist posture and the USG commitment to force it to become a Soviet client by barring aid from elsewhere and economic relations with the US, on which all of Central America relies; and to entrench the doctrine that the USG is seeking to establish democracy in Central America as it acted to destroy any possibility of meaningful democracy and social reform. This duty was performed with discipline and success. During the period of the demolition of the accords (August 1987-January 1988), the primary task was to focus them on Nicaragua so that the US clients can violate their terms with impunity, to suppress the US actions to undermine the accords, and to eliminate any verification apparatus so that these actions can continue. This goal too was achieved, a major USG victory.

<P>In the coming months, the task is to deflect attention from the USG and its clients while depicting every effort by Nicaragua to survive the continuing US attack as a violation of Ortega's promises, proving that Communists cannot be trusted and preparing the ground for further steps to enforce "regional standards" in Central America. Thus if the USG directs the contra civilian front to block a cease-fire, that will prove that Ortega is uncompromising; the continued refusal of El Salvador and Guatemala to negotiate with authentic guerrillas will continue to pass without notice.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT9" HREF="#FN9">9</A></SUP></FONT> If Nicaragua attempts to prevent its information system from being taken over by the US and its local clients, that will be offered as proof of their iniquity by state ideologists in the media who pretend not to understand the meaning of a "free market" operating under vast disproportion of resources. And the same will be true of measures to sustain the economy that has been destroyed by US violence and economic warfare, or indeed any measures that differentiate Nicaragua from some Scandinavian democracy in times of peace. Nicaragua has been unable to adopt measures standard in democratic states in times of crisis. I doubt that there a historical precedent for the phenomenon of <CITE>La Prensa</CITE>, a disinformation journal subsidized by the superpower attacking Nicaragua and openly supporting this attack. Its editor, Jaime Chamorro, publicly called for contra aid in the US press in 1986. In a December 1987 interview with Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, a member of the CIA-run "civilian directorate" of the contras, he is identified as "the co-director of <CITE>La Prensa</CITE> who chose to fight outside the country against the Sandinista dictatorship." In a November interview, the Conservative Party leader interpreted the Sandinista agreement to negotiate with the contras through Cardinal Obando as a "recognition of their legitimacy," which makes the contras a "legitimate part of the Nicaraguan community with all rights" so that the internal opposition can openly identify with them. In a follow-up interview, contra leader Adolfo Calero lauds this explicit association with the contras, as the journal does regularly, a position further endorsed by other members of the internal opposition that functions openly in Nicaragua, supporting the US terrorist attack. There are many similar examples. The record of the US and its clients under far less onerous conditions teaches us a good deal about the conditions that are imposed by the powerful, necessarily accepted by the weak.

<P>One qualification. According to State Department doctrine, as a result of the failure to provide official aid to the Freedom Fighters, "the top priority issue" for the US clients will "shift from democratic development to renewed fear of security," with "resurgence of the military" now "inevitable" and a likelikood of coups and repression (Elliott Abrams), a warning reiterated by General Fred Woerner of the Southern Command after the House vote and a virtual authorization for increased terror.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT10" HREF="#FN10">10</A></SUP></FONT> If state terror can be blamed on "communist subversion" originating from Nicaragua (Abrams), constraints on media coverage of the client regimes might relax.


<H3>Off the Agenda</H3>

<P>The most important diplomatic event of January 1988 was the report of the International Commission (CIVS) charged with monitoring compliance with the accords. It singled out the USG for condemnation because of its continued assistance "to the irregular forces operating against the government of Nicaragua," thus violating "an indispensable requirement for the success of the peace efforts and of this Procedure as a whole." A CIVS official informed the press that Latin American representatives were "shocked by the attitudes of patent fear" expressed by trade unionists and opposition figures in El Salvador and Guatemala, adding that the CIVS could not provide details about compliance because of objections from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala -- indicating what the report would have said, had it not been blocked by the US and its clients (Peter Ford, <CITE>Christian Science Monitor</CITE>, Jan. 15, 1988). These conclusions are obviously useless for ideological warfare. Correspondingly, James LeMoyne of the <CITE>New York Times</CITE>, in a report focusing on denunciations of Nicaragua, dismissed the CIVS report in one sentence, stating only that its meeting ended "with little agreement" (the report was adopted unanimously). The condemnation of the US was briefly noted in an article on another topic 9 days later by his colleague Stephen Kinzer, who explained that "the commission fell out of favor in some circles when it reported that Nicaragua had taken `concrete steps toward the beginning of a democratic process'." He noted further that President Duarte "suggested that news reports would be enough to determine which nations were complying," reflecting his insight into the Free Press. The Commission was disbanded under US pressure as too sympathetic to Nicaragua, granting to the US the privilege of pursuing its terrorist exercises unhampered and permitting Duarte to continue to serve as a front man and apologist for terror and murder.

<P>In the US client states, the terror and repression that escalated during the first phase of the accords (see <CITE>Zeta</CITE>, January) continued through the final demolition. A few examples will illustrate.

<P>On the day of the House vote, judicial authorities in El Salvador confirmed the discovery of the bodies of two men and a teen-age boy at a well-known dumping ground for the death squads associated with the security forces. They informed the press that the three bodies were found blindfolded with hands tied behind their backs and signs of torture. The nongovernmental Human Rights Commission (CDHES), which continues to function despite the assassination of its founders and directors, reported that 13 bodies had been found in the preceding two weeks, most showing signs of torture typical of the death squads. Seven bullet-ridden bodies were found on January 17 on a ranch, including two women "who had been hanged from a tree by their hair"; "their breasts were cut off and their faces painted red," a CDHES spokesman reported, on condition of anonymity for fear of the death squads. The bodies of three tortured men were found on January 25. The spokesman added that the murders were "committed according to the <I>modus operandi</I> of death squads and demonstrate that these actions perpetrated by security forces and armed forces are continuing." This information, reported by AP, is available to readers of Canada's leading journal (<CITE>Toronto Globe & Mail</CITE>, Feb. 3), but there is no word in the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> or <CITE>Washington Post</CITE>.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT11" HREF="#FN11">11</A></SUP></FONT>

<P>In late December, the auxiliary Archbishop of San Salvador said in a homily that some means must be found "to stop these death squads, which are crouching in the darkness ready to pounce and ready to return to the abuses of past years."<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT12" HREF="#FN12">12</A></SUP></FONT> In a televised mass on January 3, Archbishop Rivera y Damas once again denounced "the practice of torture used against many Salvadorans by the death squads." He stated that bishops in several provinces reported increased death squad murders and called for an end to assassinations and torture.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT13" HREF="#FN13">13</A></SUP></FONT> Little of this is noted in the media, and none of it in the <CITE>New York Times</CITE>, which also does not report that leading Church figures who have fled from El Salvador (including a close associate of the assassinated Archbishop Romero), well-known Salvadoran writers, and others who are by no stretch of the imagination "political activists," and who are well-known to <CITE>Times</CITE> correspondents, still cannot return to the death squad "democracy" they applaud, for fear of assassination. On the contrary, James LeMoyne perceives greater freedom in El Salvador than in Nicaragua, where the pro-contra internal opposition complain about harassment (regularly featured in the <CITE>Times</CITE>), but survive without fear for their lives.

<P>After CDHES president Herbert Anaya was assassinated on October 26, his widow, a lawyer who had defended political prisoners, fled with her five children to Canada. She called for an international commission to investigate the murder and offered to produce a witness who could identify the murderers from the security forces if the person's safety could be secured. The CHEDS rejected the confession of a 19-year-old high school student in police custody that he had murdered Anaya on orders of the guerrillas. His older sister informed the press that he was asleep when the murder took place and that "physical and psychological pressures" had been used to force a confession: "He looked drugged. He looked really bad. He was totally intimidated. He said they were interrogating him day and night and that they wouldn't let him eat." His mother supported this testimony and told a news conference that she had been offered a bribe by the government to collaborate. These facts were omitted by the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> in its coverage of the confession.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT14" HREF="#FN14">14</A></SUP></FONT>

<P>The Council on Hemispheric Affairs, in its Human Rights Review for 1987, once again named El Salvador as among the worst violators of human rights (along with Chile, Colombia, the contras, and the Shining Path guerrillas in Peru), with Guatemala, Haiti, Peru and Paraguay "close behind." They cited the "recent violence in El Salvador" including killings "in typical death-squad fashion, the victims being shot down from a passing car or their throats slit after being tortured," two recent deaths under custody of the National Police, and Duarte's continuing refusal to seek justice "for the perpetrators of even a single crime against a Salvadoran citizen during his more than six years of holding power."<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT15" HREF="#FN15">15</A></SUP></FONT>

<P>In September, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights of the OAS issued a report noting a "perceptible decline in the observance of human rights" in Guatemala, expressing concern over "the resumption of methods and systems for eliminating persons in mass and the reappearance of the dreadful death squads." The Guatemalan Human Rights Commission reported 334 extrajudicial executions and 73 disappearances in the first 9 months of 1987, and an executive committee member (Toribio Pineda) visiting Washington stated that "the accords are being used as a smoke screen and the human rights situation is becoming much graver.... [The accords have served] to allow violations with much more impunity." The Costa Rica-based Commission for the Defense of Human Rights in Central America informed the UN in November that in Guatemala, "repressive action has continued with the usual characteristics: the appearance of corpses with clear signs of torture on the roadsides and street; the abduction and execution of popular leaders [giving examples]; an increase in arbitrary detentions which later became forced disappearances"; and numerous "other violations which call for the attention of the international community gathered here." The report documented some 175 cases of abductions, disappearances, and assassinations from August 8 to November 17, 1987, in addition to grenade attacks, a bomb thrown into a church, etc., while Pineda reported that the documented cases represent only a fraction of the abuses, because most take place outside of the capital (the same is reported in El Salvador), citing also indiscriminate bombings, destruction of crops, and so on.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT16" HREF="#FN16">16</A></SUP></FONT>. In both countries, as in Honduras, the provisions of the accords calling for "justice, freedom and democracy" and guarantees for "the inviolability of all forms of life and liberty" and "the safety of the people" are a cynical mockery, thanks to USG-media priorities.

<P>In the <CITE>Christian Science Monitor</CITE>, which still provides professional reporting from Central America, Wilson Ring reported on January 29 that the human rights situation in Honduras has deterioriated since the accords were signed, quoting Ramon Custodio, head of the Human Rights Commission, who reported 107 assassinations by security forces in 1987. "While many acknowledge the human rights situation in Honduras is worsening," Ring continues, "all say the abuses pale in comparison with those in neighboring El Salvador and Guatemala, where political murders are an almost daily occurrence." The International Verification Commission apparently shared this assessment, one reason why it had to be dispatched to the memory hole.

<P>Meanwhile, James LeMoyne concludes (Feb. 7) that "American support for elected governments [meaning, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras] has been a relative success." No doubt true, by some standards.

<P>In short, the three US client states remain safely within "the Central American mode," a matter of no concern since they have been exempted from the accords by USG fiat with the tacit approval of the media and Congress.


<H3>Hawks and Doves</H3>

<P>By mid-January, the accords had been effectively dismantled. Nevertheless, there are factors that are pressing the USG toward the position of the doves. Before turning to these matters, I would like to place the discussion in a context that seems to me relevant for understanding the unfolding events.

<P>There are persistent features of USG policy, reflecting the stability of the domestic institutions from which it derives. A condition for entering the arena of respectable debate or participating in state management is adherence to this doctrinal framework. The basic principle is that independent nationalism and development geared to domestic needs are unacceptable. Any deviation requires that discipline be imposed, either by force or in other ways. Thus the doves argue that since "the Contra effort is woefully inadequate to achieve...democracy in Nicaragua," we should "isolate" the "reprehensible" government in Managua and "leave it to fester in its own juices" while blocking Sandinista efforts "to export violent revolution" (Senator Alan Cranston, February 1986).<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT17" HREF="#FN17">17</A></SUP></FONT> The US clients, in contrast, merit aid and support. They conform to the Central American mode of repression, exploitation, and rule by privileged elements that accede to the demands of US power ("democracy"), so even hideous atrocities are of no account.

<P>Within this elite consensus, there is room for tactical debate. The choices range between the hard line reliance on force and a soft line preference for economic and other pressures. Thus one may oppose the contras because the hard line option is perceived to have failed (in reality, it succeeded in its major aim of reversing social reforms and development for domestic needs, thus preventing the feared demonstration effect regularly described as "exporting violent revolution"); and with the destruction of the Nicaraguan economy, the same policy goals can be pursued by less costly means. Or one may support the contras on the grounds that violence may prove effective in enforcing "regional standards."

<P>The basic policy goals are frankly spelled out in the internal record. Immediately after the US destroyed Guatemalan democracy in 1954, the National Security Council produced a Top Secret Memorandum titled "U.S. Policy Toward Latin America" (NSC 5432). It opened by explaining that the major threat to US interests is "the trend in Latin America toward nationalistic regimes" that respond to "popular demand for immediate improvement in the low living standards of the masses" and for production geared to domestic needs. This is intolerable, because the US is committed to "encouraging a climate conducive to private investment," and must "encourage" the Latin American countries "to base their economies on a system of private enterprise, and, as essential thereto, to create a political and economic climate conducive to private investment of both domestic and foreign capital," including guarantees for the "opportunity to earn and in the case of foreign capital to repatriate a reasonable return." These principles are reiterated elsewhere, often verbatim (e.g., NSC 5613/1, Sept. 25, 1956). The Latin American countries must concentrate on export-oriented production in accord with the needs of US investors. To facilitate these goals, so this and later documents explain forthrightly, it is necessary for the US to control the Latin American military, which has the responsibility to overthrow civilian governments that do not conform to US requirements (called "the welfare of the nation"); the methods are examined in detail. It is also necessary to overcome the excessive liberalism of Latin American governments, to block "subversion" (that is, the wrong ideas), and in general to bar any challenge to US domination. The US has no objection to democratic forms -- indeed, these are useful for the purposes of population control at home -- but only if conditions are established, by violence if necessary, to ensure that the threat of independent development, social reform and broad democratic participation has been overcome. Closet Marxists in planning circles perceive that a class struggle is in process in Latin America, and that to win this struggle, the US may have to rely on force, since plainly it lacks political appeal among "the masses" with their unacceptable aspirations and susceptibility to what internal documents call "ultranationalism," meaning efforts to break out of the approved mold.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT18" HREF="#FN18">18</A></SUP></FONT>

<P>These problems arise throughout the world. During the Vietnam war, USG scholarship and captured Vietnamese documents agreed that the US is militarily strong but politically weak, and therefore must displace confrontation from the political to the military arena, where violence can prevail. Much the same has been true in Latin America, and remains so.

<P>Ideas of this nature have been implemented since World War II in order to maintain a world system subordinated to the needs of the US economy, or more accurately, its proprietors. It is hardly surprising that elite groups that dominate US political life should formulate and implement such global programs, just as it is natural that all of this should be suppressed in a well-functioning ideological system. Crucially, evolving policy conforms generally to the directives outlined in internal documents. In particular, there is a good correlation between US aid and the investment climate in Third World countries; and given the means required to safeguard the basic policy principles, we find that as a corollary, US aid correlates with human rights violations. In Latin America, the leading academic specialist on the topic concluded from a revealing study that US aid "has tended to flow disproportionately to...the hemisphere's relatively egregious violators of fundamental human rights," to governments "which torture their citizens" (Lars Schoultz). Other studies have shown the same, and the reasons are not hard to discern.

<P>The tactical choices within this framework cannot be associated with particular individuals or groups. Thus Henry Kissinger was a dove with regard to China, where he agreed with Richard Nixon that the hard line policy was unproductive and that other measures could draw China into the US-dominated global system. At the same time he was a hawk with regard to the Middle East, supporting Israel's refusal to accept a full-scale peace treaty offered by Egypt and Jordan in early 1971 and blocking State Department moves toward a diplomatic resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict, establishing a policy that still prevails and explains much of what is happening in that region today.

<P>We can learn a good deal by attention to the range of choices. Keeping just to Latin America, consider the efforts to eliminate the Allende regime in Chile. There were two parallel operations. Track II, the hard line, aimed at a military coup. This was concealed from Ambassador Edward Korry, a Kennedy liberal, whose task was to implement Track I, the soft line; in Korry's words, to "do all within our power to condemn Chile and the Chileans to utmost deprivation and poverty, a policy designed for a long time to come to accelerate the hard features of a Communist society in Chile." The soft line was an extension of the long-term CIA effort to control Chilean democracy. One indication of its level is that in the 1964 election, the CIA spent twice as much per Chilean voter to block Allende as the total spent per voter by both parties in the US elections of the same year.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT19" HREF="#FN19">19</A></SUP></FONT> Similarly in the case of Cuba, the Eisenhower administration planned a direct attack while Vice-President Nixon, keeping to the soft line in a secret discussion of June 1960, expressed his concern that according to a CIA briefing, "Cuba's economic situation had not deteriorated significantly since the overthrow of Batista," then urging specific measures to place "greater economic pressure on Cuba."<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT20" HREF="#FN20">20</A></SUP></FONT>

<P>To take another case of contemporary relevance, in 1949 the CIA identified "two areas of instability" in Latin America: Bolivia and Guatemala (<CITE>Review of the World Situation</CITE>, 17 August 1949). The Eisenhower administration pursued the hard line to overthrow capitalist democracy in Guatemala but chose the soft line with regard to a Bolivian revolution that had the support of the Communist Party and radical tin miners, had led to expropriation, and had even moved towards "criminal agitation of the Indians of the farms and mines" and a pro-peace conference, as a reactionary Archbishop warned.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT21" HREF="#FN21">21</A></SUP></FONT> The USG concluded that the best plan was to support the least radical elements, expecting that US pressures, including domination of the tin market, would serve to control unwanted developments. As John Foster Dulles explained, this would be the best way to contain the "Communist infection in South America"; terms such as "infection," "virus," "cancer," etc., are standard in the public and internal records, rhetoric not without precedent in recent history. In accordance with standard doctrine, the US took control over the Bolivian military, equipping it with modern armaments and sending hundreds of officers to the "school of coups" in Panama and elsewhere. Bolivia was soon subject to US influence and control. By 1953, the NSC noted improvement in "the climate for private investment," including "an agreement permitting a private American firm to exploit two petroleum areas" (NSC 141/1, "Progress Report," July 23, 1953). A military coup took place in 1964. A 1980 coup was carried out with the assistance of Klaus Barbie, who had been sent to Bolivia when he could no longer be protected in France, where he had been carrying out anti-resistance activities under US control as he had done under the Nazis. By now, one out of three Bolivian infants dies in the first year of life, so that Bolivia has the slowest rate of population growth in Latin America along with the highest birth rate, according to a recent UNICEF study. The FAO estimates that the average Bolivian consumes 78% of daily minimum calorie and protein requirements and that more than half of Bolivian children suffer from malnutrition. Of the economically active population, 25% are unemployed and another 40% work in the "informal sector" (e.g., smuggling and drugs).<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT22" HREF="#FN22">22</A></SUP></FONT>

<P>Several points merit attention. First, the consequences of the hard line in Guatemala and the soft line in Bolivia were similar. Second, both policy decisions were successful in their major aim: containing the "Communist virus," the threat of "ultranationalism." Third, both policies are evidently regarded as quite proper, as we can see in the case of Bolivia by the complete lack of interest in what has happened since (apart from possible costs to the US through the drug racket); and with regard to Guatemala, by the successful intervention under Kennedy to block a democratic election, the direct US participation in murderous counterinsurgency campaigns under Lyndon Johnson, the continuing supply of arms to Guatemala through the late 1970s and the reliance on our Israeli mercenary state to fill any gaps, the enthusiastic US support for atrocities that go well beyond even the astonishing Guatemalan norm in the 1980s, and the applause for the "fledgling democracy" that the ruling military now tolerate as a means to extort money from Congress. We may say that these are "messy episodes" and "blundering" (which in fact succeeded in its major aims), but nothing more (Stephen Kinzer, Jan. 10, 1988). Fourth, the soft line and the hard line were adopted by the same people, at the same time, revealing that the issues are tactical, involving no departure from shared principle. All of this provides insight into the nature of US policy, and the prevailing political culture.

<P>With these considerations in mind, let us turn to current US policies toward Central America, where there was a challenge to the persistent principles in the 1970s. In El Salvador, the US wasted little time in moving towards the hard line, and tactical debate terminated when it appeared that the slaughter conducted by the US mercenary army was achieving its goals. We should not overlook the success of these policies. Well after the 1984 elections that established "democracy" in El Salvador to the applause of the Free Press and responsible opinion generally, the human rights organization Socorro Juridico, operating under the protection of the Archdiocese of San Salvador, observed that the continuing terror is still conducted by "the same members of the armed forces who enjoy official approval and are adequately trained to carry out these acts of collective suffering." "Salvadoran society, affected by terror and panic, a result of the persistent violation of basic human rights, shows the following traits: collective intimidation and generalized fear, on the one hand, and on the other the internalized acceptance of the terror because of the daily and frequent use of violent means. In general, society accepts the frequent appearance of tortured bodies, because basic rights, the right to life, has absolutely no overriding value for society."

<P>The last comment also applies to the society that oversees these operations, as underscored by George Shultz in one of his lamentations on terrorism (April 14, 1986, a talk delivered at the very moment of the US terror bombing of Libya). In El Salvador, he declaimed, "the results are something all Americans can be proud of" -- at least, all Americans who enjoy the sight of tortured bodies, starving children, terror and panic and generalized fear.

<P>These observations on Salvadoran society under "democracy" were presented at the First International Seminar on Torture in Latin America at Buenos Aires in December 1985, a conference devoted to "the repressive system" that "has at its disposal knowledge and a multinational technology of terror, developed in specialized centers whose purpose is to perfect methods of exploitation, oppression and dependence of individuals and entire peoples" by the use of "state terrorism inspired by the Doctrine of National Security," which can be traced to the historic decision of the Kennedy administration to shift the mission of the Latin American military to "internal security."<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT23" HREF="#FN23">23</A></SUP></FONT> The conference passed without notice here, and, of course, none of this falls within the canon of terrorism as conceived in the civilized world.

<P>In the case of Nicaragua, after a brief experiment with soft line measures to place privileged US-backed elements in power ("supporting democracy"), the US turned to terror and economic warfare. An impediment to the normal policies was that the Nicaraguan military could not be converted into a subversive force in the usual fashion. Therefore it was necessary to construct a proxy army to attack Nicaragua from foreign bases, a variant of familiar programs.

<P>The sharp change in US policy towards Nicaragua is instructive. In the 1960s and 1970s, under Somoza's tyranny, Nicaragua was one of the highest per capita recipients of US economic aid in Latin America, because, as the AID mission explained in 1977, "U.S. investment is welcomed in Nicaragua's developing free enterprise economy" and Somoza supports US policy objectives. Military assistance was high, to ensure that Somoza's National Guard could perform its functions (see Tom Barry and Deb Preusch, <CITE>The Soft War</CITE> (Grove, 1988)). Not long after the Guard was driven from Nicaragua, this massive aid resumed, to its successor force; the Reaganite propaganda victory has been so extraordinary that in congressional debate, contra aid is often described as "aid to Nicaragua," even by the most outspoken doves, who oppose Reagan's "desire to aid Nicaragua" (Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts, <CITE>Congressional Record</CITE>, Dec. 9, 1987). Economic aid was also high in the 60s and 70s. Under Carter, more such aid went to Nicaragua than to any other Central American nation, in addition to other international aid. There was an "economic miracle," with a rapid rise in GNP -- and in child malnutrition and general misery, given the nature of the development model. After Carter's early attempt to use aid as a lever to back "Nicaragua's forces of moderation" (i.e., the pro-US private sector), aid terminated to be replaced by lethal economic warfare. The USG policy shift coincides with a shift in Nicaragua from harsh repression and robbery of the poor to successful efforts to direct scarce resources to their needs. It is a striking feature of our political culture that the meaning of these facts cannot be understood.

<P>The hard line today calls for military force, but this is increasingly a minority view. By 1986, the contra option was opposed by 80% of "leaders," the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations reports.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT24" HREF="#FN24">24</A></SUP></FONT> The soft line calls for the resort to less violent measures now that US terror has succeeded in overcoming the threat of improvements in health and literacy and the "virus" of successful development that might, it was feared, have had a demonstration effect in a "revolution without borders" (all of this concealed in conventional rhetoric, with the fraud particularly transparent by virtue of the extraordinary degree of lying). It is also anticipated that the social fabric has been sufficiently torn to shreds, and enough popular disaffection created, to add considerably to the massive problems of reconstruction, should the US military attack diminish. It is assumed that people will blame those in power for their suffering and all can see that it is because of the Sandinistas that the US persists in driving Nicaragua to ruin. Apart from the military attack, US economic warfare has been highly effective in reversing development, undermining health and other social services, and wiping out private enterprise, unable to develop alternative sources of supply and markets that the government could sometimes find, though at severe cost. These consequences also permit US journalists to deplore the "bitterness and apathy in Nicaragua" (James LeMoyne),<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT25" HREF="#FN25">25</A></SUP></FONT> attributing it to Sandinista mismanagement and repression. The operative question for policy, then, is whether to persist with the hard line or, as the doves typically prefer, to ensure in other ways that Nicaragua will "fester in its own juices" in "utmost deprivation and poverty" until it sees the light.

<P>These alternatives fall well within the traditional policy consensus that the cancer of independent development must be excised. Correspondingly, these alternatives are the subject of ample debate in the media, reflecting elite controversy. This debate sometimes misleads even dissident opinion, which fails to see that it conforms to the persistent principles of policy and ideology. Departure from this framework in the Free Press is very marginal, and the elementary truths about US policy are inexpressible. Indeed it is considered inappropriate to bring up the historical or documentary record, since at each point in time, the US has undergone a miraculous change of course and the past is therefore irrelevant, a useful doctrinal principle, regularly invoked. Thus James LeMoyne, replaying the familiar record, informs us that the US "has acted inexcusably in the recent past and Americans know it," but now all has changed, and the US is committed to fostering the required "political change in the region,"<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT26" HREF="#FN26">26</A></SUP></FONT> one notable example being the sudden dedication to "democracy" in Nicaragua dating (by odd coincidence) from July 1979 -- while, curiously, we follow the same policies in the region as always, except with increased brutality. In the real world, nothing relevant has changed.

<P>The shared dove-hawk consensus was illustrated dramatically during the Miranda affair staged by the state propaganda services, with the media offering their ardent support as usual, beginning December 13 with two long front-page articles in the <CITE>Washington Post</CITE> on the remarkable revelations of this high-level defector (rewarded with $800,000 for his services) and statements by Daniel and Humberto Ortega; others followed suit, and the topic received immense coverage and elicited much indignation. The extravaganza was timed to coincide with administration efforts, which succeeded, to ram through renewed authorization for the CIA to fly supplies into Nicaragua, thus laying the basis for continued war. The sole Miranda revelation that merited even a phrase was that the USG had been falsifying the level of Soviet and Cuban advisers, far lower, as he revealed, than had been claimed. But this is so familiar that little attention was warranted, and little was given, though not for this reason; similarly, little (if any) notice was given to the report that Cuba's foreign minister "reiterated his country's offer to withdraw its military advisers from Nicaragua once the U.S.-backed contra campaign against the Sandinista government ends" (AP, Feb. 1, 1988). Rather, there was a huge media barrage designed to show that Managua is threatening to "overwhelm and terrorize" its neighbors (<CITE>Washington Post</CITE>). The same <CITE>Post</CITE> editorial observed that "Nicaragua will be a prime place to test the sanguine forecast that [Gorbachev] is now turning down the heat in the Third World," thus placing the onus for the US attack against Nicaragua on the Russians, another impressive Agitprop achievement.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT27" HREF="#FN27">27</A></SUP></FONT>

<P>The factual basis for these impassioned charges was as follows: as reported by Miranda, and confirmed by the Ortegas, Nicaragua was planning to reduce its military forces and to provide light armaments to the general population for defense against a possible US invasion, thus creating a nation in arms -- on the model of Israel, for example, though at a far lower level. As Defense Minister Ortega stated in remarks that were transmuted in a most miraculous way as they passed through the media filter, "It is not our intention to be an offensive army, capable of attacking another country. We simply want to have all the modern weapons needed to defend our country."<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT28" HREF="#FN28">28</A></SUP></FONT> To convert this into a threat to "overwhelm and terrorize" Central America is quite an achievement, even for the Free Press, which exulted that the Sandinistas themselves admitted that "with Soviet help, they plan to build a reserve army of more than half a million men" to ensure "that the party will continue to control much of Nicaragua" (James LeMoyne), not to defend Nicaragua from eventual US invasion. Defense against possible US aggression cannot be the motive for arming the population, since LeMoyne asserts as definite fact that "the United States will not invade Nicaragua," which settles the issue. It is therefore only a cover for totalitarianism when Nicaragua's population is mobilized while the US attack escalates and the US military carries out constant military maneuvers on its borders, and there is no reason for Nicaragua to pay attention to comments by American officials that "they worry that the end result of the Arias peace plan will be to increase the likelihood of an invasion of Nicaragua" -- also cited by LeMoyne, exhibiting his considerable gift for self-refutation.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT29" HREF="#FN29">29</A></SUP></FONT>

<P>Another charge was that Nicaragua was considering actions in the US client states in the event of a US invasion, the ultimate proof that they are Stalinist monsters. Still another stunning revelation was that Nicaragua was hoping to obtain jet planes to defend its territory from US attack, an intolerable outrage. As Mary McGrory observed, "mere mention of MIGs makes hawks out of the most resolute congressional doves."<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT30" HREF="#FN30">30</A></SUP></FONT> It is, of course, well-understood that Nicaragua has no other way to prevent the CIA from supplying the forces it directs within Nicaragua. In fact, Nicaragua has made it clear, repeatedly, that it would be happy to obtain French Mirage jets, but this fact cannot be reported because it would give the game away, and would undermine the ominous references to the "Soviet-supplied Sandinistas" that are necessary to keep the domestic US population in line.

<P>The logic of the US response is clear: Nicaragua has no right of self-defense. It is intolerable, tantamount to aggression, for Nicaragua to interfere with US violence and terror by arming its population in self-defense or attempting to defend its airspace. This doctrine of the elite consensus is, again, highly revealing, as is the fact that its meaning cannot be perceived.

<P>It is interesting that in the midst of the furor over Sandinista plans to obtain means to defend themselves, the US began shipping advanced F-5 jet planes to Honduras on Dec. 15,<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT31" HREF="#FN31">31</A></SUP></FONT> unreported by the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> apart from subsequent reference in quotes from Ortega and Arias buried in articles on other matters.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT32" HREF="#FN32">32</A></SUP></FONT>

<P>In yet another propaganda coup, James LeMoyne announced that in response to Miranda's charges, Defense Minister Ortega "seemed indirectly to confirm the existence of Sandinista assistance to Salvadoran rebels." This is LeMoyne's rendition of Ortega's statement that the Reagan administration had no right to produce such charges given its arming of the contras. What Ortega went on to say, as LeMoyne knows but would not report, is that "the Salvadoran guerrillas have some resources and ways to get weapons" and they "are basically armed through their own efforts," not depending "on outside sources; they are self-sufficient." This conversion of Ortega's denial of Nicaraguan support for Salvadoran guerrillas to an admission of such support is important for LeMoyne, because one of his major doctrines is that Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Guatemala are alike in that they all face "externally backed guerrilla war." This is a central element of Washington propaganda, so it is the duty of the Free Press to insist upon the claim, however absurd the comparison may be. Since LeMoyne cannot conjure up KGB supply flights at the level of 2-3 a day into El Salvador to keep the guerrillas in the field, not to speak of the other elements of the "low intensity conflict," he has to do the best he can; hence his grasping at the straw of Defense Minister Ortega's comments, reconstructed in the required fashion while the unwanted facts are marginalized or suppressed.

<P>LeMoyne has made a noble effort to establish the "symmetry" required for doctrinal reasons. In August 1987, he reported that though rebels in El Salvador deny receiving support from Nicaragua, "ample evidence shows it exists, and it is questionable how long they could survive without it."<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT33" HREF="#FN33">33</A></SUP></FONT> Thus they are much like the contras, who, as regularly conceded, "would have difficulty surviving" without the massive CIA airlift (<CITE>NYT</CITE> military correspondent Bernard Trainor, Jan. 27, 1988), and could not attack "soft targets" without the extraordinary intelligence and communication apparatus provided by their foreign master. LeMoyne presented no evidence, then or ever, and has yet to comment on the fact that State Department efforts to substantiate these claims are derisory (and were dismissed as such by the World Court); but it is required for propaganda, so therefore it is a fact.

<P><CITE>Times</CITE> efforts to protect this required fact are intriguing. After LeMoyne's statement appeared, the media monitoring organization FAIR wrote a letter to the <CITE>Times</CITE> asking them to share LeMoyne's "ample evidence" with its readers. Their letter was not published, but they did receive a response from foreign editor Joseph Lelyveld acknowledging that LeMoyne had been "imprecise."<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT34" HREF="#FN34">34</A></SUP></FONT> LeMoyne, and the <CITE>Times</CITE>, have had ample opportunity since to correct this "imprecise" report, and they have used it, namely, to repeat the charges that they privately acknowledge to be without merit. LeMoyne does this regularly, either explicitly as in the cases mentioned, or implicitly in his constant reference to the "symmetry" between El Salvador and Nicaragua -- indeed, the fact that Nicaragua is "far more militarized than neighboring El Salvador, a country also at war," a statement that would embarrass a moderately serious journalist.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT35" HREF="#FN35">35</A></SUP></FONT> LeMoyne, who describes himself as occupying the middle ground between "ideologues of left and right,"<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT36" HREF="#FN36">36</A></SUP></FONT> is not alone in maintaining the fiction of "symmetry." Thus in the midst of the Miranda farce, Stephen Engelberg wrote in the <CITE>Times</CITE> that "although no firm evidence was ever unveiled" to show that Nicaragua was supplying the rebels from 1981 to 1984, "a range of intelligence officials said the circumstantial case for Nicaraguan involvement was overwhelming," an argument that "appears to have been confirmed" by Miranda, who "said the Sandinistas were shipping the weapons to El Salvador by sea."<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT37" HREF="#FN37">37</A></SUP></FONT> That is, they are shipping weapons via the Gulf of Fonseca, which is 30 km wide, heavily patrolled by US naval vessels and SEAL teams and covered by a radar facility on Tiger Island in the Gulf, able to locate and track boats not only in that area but far beyond, as discussed in World Court testimony by David MacMichael, the CIA analyst responsible for analyzing the relevant material during the period to which Engelberg refers. Despite these extensive efforts, no evidence could be produced, though Nicaragua, curiously, has no difficulty providing evidence of CIA supplies in the supposedly "symmetrical" situation. It was, in fact, precisely these charges, presented by the State Department and now relayed by <CITE>Times</CITE> ideologues as "news," that were reviewed and dismissed by the World Court. Later George Volsky added (Jan. 20) that the provision of the accords calling "for all countries to deny the use of their territories to insurgents in neighboring nations...applies mainly to Nicaragua, which is said to be helping rebels in El Salvador, and to Honduras, whose territory is reportedly an important part of the United States-directed contra supply effort." Surely a balanced and judicious summary of the available evidence. And LeMoyne warns (Feb. 7) that if in the future "the Sandinistas [are] found still to be aiding Salvadoran guerrillas" (as they are now, according to doctrinal Truth), then the peace accords will collapse; no other similar problem is noted.

<P>It is pointless to comment that it would be entirely proper to provide assistance to people seeking to defend themselves from a foreign-installed terrorist army, a conception that is so far from intelligible here (in the case of our clients, that is) that we need not tarry over it.

<P>The reaction of the doves to the Miranda public relations coup is instructive. With rare exceptions, they did not respond by saying that Nicaragua has every right to arm its population in defense against a possible US invasion and to obtain means to defend its national territory. Rather, they argued that Miranda may be unreliable, that the Sandinista plans are only a "wish list," etc., conceding that the revelations were devastating. These reactions reflect the shared consensus that no country has the right to defend itself against US attack.


<H3>The Peace Accords: In Memoriam</H3>

<P>Ideological warfare heated up in the following weeks, as the accords approached their mid-January "deadline." On January 10, the <CITE>New York Times Magazine</CITE> published its comprehensive review of the state of affairs, running two articles, one by James LeMoyne on the conflict between Arias and his adversary Daniel Ortega, the other by Stephen Kinzer asking whether Ortega can be trusted. Nowhere is there a word referring to the actions of the USG to undermine the accords, and questions concerning the two US-backed terror states and its client state of Honduras arise only peripherally, in conformity to USG priorities.

<P>LeMoyne gives an account of Arias intended to be laudatory, but in fact depicting him as an opportunist and moral monster who is unconcerned over terror in El Salvador and Guatemala, the horrible conditions that persist in Honduras, the fact that all three states are effectively under military rule backed by the US, or the terrorism of the US proxy army attacking Nicaragua. Rather, in this account, Arias's prime concern is that the contras are a "military Edsel," a failure, so that other methods must be found to pressure the Sandinistas "to moderate their revolutionary project"; but we must bear in mind that we are hearing Arias through a particular ideological filter. LeMoyne refers to Jose Figueres Ferrer -- "the man who is widely considered the father of Costa Rican democracy" -- but does not tell us, nor would he or his colleagues ever tell us, what Figueres has to say about the Sandinistas: namely, that "for the first time, Nicaragua has a government that cares for its people," that he found "a surprising amount of support for the government" on a recent visit, that theirs is "an invaded country" and that the United States should allow the Sandinistas "to finish what they started in peace; they deserve it."<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT38" HREF="#FN38">38</A></SUP></FONT> Such comments lack ideological serviceability, as does Figueres's statement that he "understands why" <CITE>La Prensa</CITE> was closed, having censored the press himself when Costa Rica was under attack by Somoza. Hence Central America's leading democratic figure must be censored out of the media, though his name can still be invoked for the anti-Sandinista crusade.

<P>Kinzer's companion article denounces Ortega for numerous sins, e.g., running fraudulent elections (a staple of USG propaganda, hence a fact, whatever the facts<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT39" HREF="#FN39">39</A></SUP></FONT>), as usual citing opposition figures but also, for balance, one "old friend" of Ortega's who is permitted to say that Ortega has "regressed" and no longer reads writers and philosophers -- as distinct from Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, ever immersed in the works of Heidegger and Wittgenstein. This exhausts the coverage of the problems of peace in the region.

<P>Those intrigued by the rhetoric of propaganda will note a standard device used by Kinzer; in column after column, critics of the Sandinistas are cited (opposition figures, vendors, workers, etc.), and for balance, the words of government figures. Supporters of the government, who must exist somewhere, are notable by their absence; favored states are naturally treated quite differently. The intended effect is to create the image of a conflict between an embattled population and a tyrannical government, on the model of the people versus Somoza. The outright propaganda journal <CITE>La Prensa</CITE> pursues the same technique, but lacks the near monopoly over the national media required under "democracy."

<P>There is no space to review here the remarkable campaign conducted by the media, most notably the <CITE>New York Times</CITE>, to ensure that the accords would be dismantled. It succeeded. By mid-January, the Verification Commission was abolished, and Ortega was compelled to go far beyond the accords, abandoning the simultaneity condition on which they were based. The "genius of the Arias plan," the <CITE>Times</CITE> editors now explain (Jan. 31), "is that it provides a means for Nicaragua to accommodate to neighbors without appearing to truckle to Washington," not the simultaneity requirement that had been so highly touted as the "genius" of the plan before the demolition job took effect. Recognizing that the powerful make the rules, Ortega agreed that Nicaragua alone would enact the provisions of the accords, even calling for an international commission to monitor Nicaragua's adherence alone.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT40" HREF="#FN40">40</A></SUP></FONT> Headlines everywhere reported that Ortega now promises to "comply with" the accords -- that is, the version fashioned in Washington, which bears little resemblance to the text -- while warning that his promises plainly cannot be trusted. No one else's promises are relevant, now that the accords have been consigned to oblivion. So powerful was the propaganda campaign that even critics were swept up in it. Thus a <CITE>Nation</CITE> editorial (Jan. 30) stated that Ortega "has made significant concessions to the Central American peace plan," namely, by agreeing to abandon it in conformity to USG orders. The US clients are now exempt, and with no further international monitoring, the USG is free to act as it wishes, subject to the controls of Congress and the Free Press, which have demonstrated their hawk-eyed vigilance so impressively in the past years.

<P>The success in undermining the accords and shaping them into an instrument of US policy are not a novel Free Press achievement. The media contribution to undermining the Paris Peace agreement of January 1973 is perhaps an even more startling example, as documented elsewhere.

<P>After the House vote, James LeMoyne summarized what had been achieved (Feb. 7). There is a "deeper problem" of facing the needed social changes in the region, a task to which we are now dedicated having recognized the earlier error of our ways -- the familiar "change of course." But that apart, "the main problem remains Nicaragua's Sandinista Government" and the prospects that it may "not comply with the peace treaty," which now gives "the last chance for moderating the course of the Nicaraguan revolution." Everyone else now having performed admirably, that is where the problem lies, exactly as the Office of Public Diplomacy demands.

<P>It nevertheless remains true that "Peace gains points." There are long-term factors that are pressing USG policy towards the position of the doves, as revealed by the survey of elite opinion cited earlier. In the coming years, it will be necessary to pay the costs of Reaganite follies. His economic managers did succeed in transferring resources from the poor to the rich and organizing a vast public subsidy to high-technology industry with its state-protected market (the Pentagon system). But their methods of Keynesian state management created huge debts and trade deficits while increasing consumption by the wealthy and financial manipulation but not productive investment, and in general left a shambles that will require a degree of austerity for less-privileged sectors of the population. A concomitant effect is that it will not be easy to terrify the population with demons to induce them to tighten their belts even further as the state subsidizes the rich and undertakes violence and subversion abroad. We already see the signs. Suddenly, the Russians are less threatening and international terrorism is less of a threat. The statesmanlike approach is now mandatory, with summitry and arms negotiations. The doves are in the ascendance, not primarily because the world is all that different, but because domestic constraints have changed. Furthermore, popular dissidence is a growing force, imposing costs that state planners cannot overlook. The courage of people resisting US dictates in Central America has been astonishing, and in Latin America generally, there are signs of independence -- the major reason why the USG so bitterly opposed the Contadora agreements, the International Verification Commission, indeed the involvement of any elements not under adequate control.

<P>While these are significant factors, in the short run they might still be overcome, leading to a renewal of congressionally-mandated violence. The hawks can take the high moral ground, espousing "freedom" and "democracy." The official doves, who do not question the basic doctrines of the Office of Public Diplomacy, can only counter that they agree, but are unwilling to pay the costs, a weak position when it comes to the crunch. Deeper tendencies run in a different direction, but it is far from clear that they will be manifested in time to save the people of Central America from further terror and misery at our hands.

<P><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="FN39" HREF="#TXT39">39</A></FONT> To prove the point, Kinzer states that "the Sandinistas controlled the electoral machinery and the opposition was splintered." The first point was investigated in detail by the Latin American Studies Association (LASA) delegation that observed the elections. Their conclusion was that the elections were remarkably fair, and that "Generally speaking, in this campaign the FSLN did little more to take advantage of its incumbency than incumbent parties everywhere (including the United States) routinely do, and considerably <I>less</I> than ruling parties in other Latin American countries traditionally do (<CITE>The Electoral Process in Nicaragua</CITE>, LASA, Nov. 19, 1984). The LASA report, like other observers reports, has been under a media ban, because of its conclusions. As for the fact that US-backed business-based parties have no conception of democratic politics and could not organize a popular constituency, it is not obvious that this is a proof of Sandinista iniquity.

<P>On August 7, 1987, the Central American Presidents signed a peace agreement in Guatemala City which, if implemented, could have a significant impact in the region.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT1" HREF="#FN1">1</A></SUP></FONT> The agreement does not address the causes of the violence and suffering that plague these long-term U.S. dependencies, but it might restrict U.S. intervention, a prerequisite to any constructive change. The circumstances of the accords should be carefully studied by those who hope to influence state policy, but I will defer this crucial topic, keeping here to the prospects for implementation of the accords.

<P>In approaching this question, we must bear in mind that we live in the Age of Orwell, in which every term has two meanings: its literal meaning, largely irrelevant in practice, and the operative meaning, devised in the interests of established power. Accordingly, there are two versions of the accords to consider: the actual text, and the radically different Washington version.

<P>We therefore face two questions: (1) Can the accords be implemented in terms of their actual content? (2) Can they be implemented according to the Washington version? The first of these questions is only an academic exercise, but it is illuminating to consider it nonetheless.


<H3>The Irrelevant Facts</H3>

<P>Keeping to the actual substance of the accords, there is no possibility that they can be implemented, as a review of the initial three-month period clearly demonstrates.

<P>The accords identify one factor as "an indispensable element to achieving a stable and lasting peace in the region," namely, termination of any form of aid "to irregular forces or insurgent movements" on the part of "regional or extraregional" governments. As a corollary, the Central American governments agree to deny their territory to any such groups. This demand is directed at the United States and the client states it has used for the attack against Nicaragua by what contra lobbyists candidly describe in internal documents as a "proxy force," organized, trained, supplied and controlled by the CIA.

<P>This central feature of the accords is redundant, since such actions are barred by a higher authority: by international law and treaty, hence by the supreme law of the land under the U.S. Constitution, which we are enjoined to celebrate this year. The fact was underscored by the World Court in June 1986 as it condemned the United States for its "unlawful use of force" against Nicaragua and called upon it to desist from these crimes. Congress responded by voting $100 million of aid and freeing the CIA to direct the attack and to use its own funds on an unknown scale. The U.S. vetoed a UN Security Council resolution calling on all states to observe international law and voted against a General Assembly resolution to the same effect, joined by Israel and El Salvador. On Nov. 12, 1987, the General Assembly again called for "full and immediate compliance" with the World Court decision. This time only Israel joined with the U.S. in opposing adherence to international law, another blow to the Central American accords, unreported by the national press as usual.

<P>The media had dismissed the World Court as a "hostile forum" whose decisions are irrelevant, while liberal advocates of world order explained that the U.S. must disregard the Court decision. With this reaction, U.S. elites clearly articulate their self-image: the United States is a lawless terrorist state, which stands above the law and is entitled to undertake violence, as it chooses, in support of its objectives. The reaction to the "indispensable element" of the Central America accords merely reiterated that conviction.

<P>To ensure that the accords would be undermined, the U.S. at once directed its proxy forces to escalate military actions, also increasing the regular supply flights that are required to keep them in the field. These had passed the level of one a day in the preceding months in support of the "spring offensive," designed to achieve sufficient levels of terror and disruption to impress Congress. The proxy army followed Washington orders to attack "soft targets" such as farm cooperatives and health clinics instead of "trying to duke it out with the Sandinistas directly," as explained by General John Galvin, commander of the U.S. Southern Command, who added that with these tactics, aimed at civilians lacking means of defense against armed terrorist bands, prospects for the contras should improve. The State Department officially authorized such attacks, with the support of media doves. There are other terrorist states, but to my knowledge, the United States is alone today in <I>officially</I> endorsing international terrorism. We see here another illustration of the self-image of U.S. elites: in a terrorist culture, all that counts is the success of violence. Accordingly, debate in Congress and the media focused on the question of whether the violence could succeed, with "doves" arguing that the proxy army was inept and hawks replying that it must be given more time and aid to prove itself as a successful terrorist force -- putting euphemisms aside.

<P>CIA-directed supply flights into Nicaragua doubled by mid-September according to the <CITE>Los Angeles Times,</CITE> while Nicaraguan sources that have been accurate in the past, though ignored, alleged that violations of Nicaraguan airspace rose from 70 in September to 110 in October, most of them supply flights, particularly in areas where the government had declared a unilateral cease-fire.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT2" HREF="#FN2">2</A></SUP></FONT> Before the OAS, President Ortega reported 140 supply flights during the three-month initial phase of the accords, an estimate dismissed as far too low by contra commander Adolfo Calero, who said that "his radar is not working very well."<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT3" HREF="#FN3">3</A></SUP></FONT> A review of the major media reveals only a few phrases alluding to these matters,<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT4" HREF="#FN4">4</A></SUP></FONT> a highly illuminating fact. Of these few references, some reveal editorial adjustments in a further service to state violence; thus the <CITE>New York Times,</CITE> which suppressed this crucial issue throughout the three-month period, did cite the statements by Ortega and Calero on Nov. 12, but where they each spoke of supply flights, the <CITE>Times</CITE> news report downgraded the reference to "surveillance flights," still a violation of international law and the agreements, but a much less serious one, and thus less unacceptable in the newspaper of record.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT5" HREF="#FN5">5</A></SUP></FONT>

<P>"Western military analysts say the contras have been stashing tons of newly airdropped weapons lately while trying to avoid heavy combat," the <CITE>Los Angeles Times</CITE> reported in October. "Meanwhile, they have stepped up attacks on easy government targets like the La Patriota farm cooperative...where several militiamen, an elderly woman and her year-old grandson died in a pre-dawn shelling."<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT6" HREF="#FN6">6</A></SUP></FONT> To select virtually at random from the many cases deemed unworthy of notice, on Nov. 21, 150 contras attacked two villages in the southern province of Rio San Juan with 88mm mortars and rocket-propelled grenades, killing six children and six adults and injuring 30 others, wire services reported, citing Nicaraguan radio. Even cooperatives of religious pacifists who refuse to bear arms are destroyed by the U.S. terrorist forces.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT7" HREF="#FN7">7</A></SUP></FONT> In a November report on human rights abuses in Nicaragua, barely noted in the 42nd paragraph of a report on contra successes in the <CITE>New York Times,</CITE> Americas Watch described the contras as an "outlaw force" whose continuing abuse of human rights means that "we see no way for compliance with the Arias plan's requirement for respect for human rights other than the dissolution of the contras and an end to all aid for them by the United States, Honduras and all others" -- the "indispensable element" for peace and an obligation under the irrelevant rule of law.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT8" HREF="#FN8">8</A></SUP></FONT>

<P>The U.S. also launched further war games in Honduras, Operation "Blazing Trail 1987," barely noted in the media. Nicaragua's protest described them as the "biggest-ever military maneuvers in Honduran territory," adding that "we can't see this in any way as a contribution to peace" -- something of an understatement.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT9" HREF="#FN9">9</A></SUP></FONT>

<P>Shortly after the accords were signed, the CIA offered $3000-a-month bribes to 14 Miskito Indian leaders to induce them to maintain the military conflict. The spokesman for the Indian opposition described this as "a last-ditch U.S. attempt to undercut their plan to pursue a negotiated settlement with the Sandinistas," UPI reported, adding that U.S. intelligence officials "have stressed what they call the strategic importance of retaining Indian participation in the war to help gain international support," the usual cynical exploitation of indigenous peoples. U.S. government officials quoted in the Mexican press report that the CIA salaries come from a secret account "for political projects," unrelated to the $100 million in congressional funding.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT10" HREF="#FN10">10</A></SUP></FONT> The going rate is considerably higher for the wealthy businessmen who serve as CIA democrats-for-hire, for example, Alfonso Robelo, who receives $10,000 monthly tax-free, or Arturo Cruz, whose secret $7000-a-month subsidy was transferred from the CIA to Oliver North's account for fear that Congress would expose his illegal lobbying and the fraud he perpetrated as a paid U.S. agent in connection with the campaign to disrupt the unwanted Nicaraguan elections of 1984 -- elections that did not take place according to the media, which regularly contrast the "elected presidents" of the U.S. client states with the Nicaraguan dictator Ortega, who was not "elected" according to official doctrine.

<P>Undersecretary of State Elliott Abrams conducted a news conference by radio in the Central American capitals on Oct. 22, unreported in the national press, at which he announced that the United States will "never accept a Soviet satellite in Central America" -- meaning a country that is not a loyal U.S. satellite -- and that "We're going to continue the aid to the resistance," to be sure, in violation of the "indispensable element" for peace. The Reagan administration announced its intention to seek congressional backing for its war, and Congress obliged by providing "humanitarian" aid -- meaning, any form of aid that the government chooses to send -- in direct violation of the accords. Secretary of State George Shultz informed the OAS that the U.S. would persist in the unlawful use of force by its "resistance fighters" until a "free Nicaragua" is established by Washington standards, thus consigning the accords to oblivion, along with international law. This announcement was noted in a 140-word item in the <CITE>Times</CITE> stressing Washington's intent to give the accords "every chance," while a headline in the liberal <CITE>Boston Globe</CITE> reported approvingly that the U.S. is "easing stance."<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT11" HREF="#FN11">11</A></SUP></FONT>

<P>While the media and Congress took note of Washington's plans for the future, the actual steps taken to undermine the central elements of the peace agreements passed in virtual silence, in accord with the principle that the United States is entitled to employ violence as it chooses. The same basic principle explains the elite consensus, including the most outspoken doves, that Nicaragua must not be permitted to obtain aircraft to defend its territory. The pretense of liberal Congressmen and others that such aircraft would be a threat to the United States may be dismissed with no comment. The real intent is obvious: the terrorist superpower must be free to penetrate Nicaraguan airspace at will for surveillance and coordination of the attacks on "soft targets" by its proxy forces, and to provide them with arms and supplies.

<P>These crucial facts suffice to demonstrate that in terms of their irrelevant substance, the accords were dead before the ink was dry, with the full support of congressional liberals and elite opinion generally.

<P>Note that as tacitly conceded on all sides, the proxy forces bear no resemblance to guerrillas. Rather, they are, by the standards of the region, a well-equipped mercenary army maintained by overwhelming U.S. power; their supporters insist that they would collapse if this unlawful aid and control were to be withdrawn. The contrast to authentic guerrillas, as in El Salvador, is dramatic, but suppressed, in the interest of maintaining the Washington fiction of a "symmetry" between Nicaragua and El Salvador. There is indeed a symmetry, though not the one put forth by Washington and its Free Press. In both countries, there is a terrorist army attacking "soft targets" and slaughtering civilians, and in both countries, it is organized and maintained by the United States: the army of El Salvador, and the proxy army attacking Nicaragua from foreign bases. The symmetry reaches to fine details. In El Salvador too, the U.S. mercenary forces attack cooperatives, killing, raping and abducting members, as Americas Watch has reported.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT12" HREF="#FN12">12</A></SUP></FONT>

<P>Let us turn now to a secondary matter, the response of the countries of the region. Honduras announced at once that it would not observe the accords. The government refused to concede the existence of contra camps within the country, and announced that no verification would be permitted until Nicaragua satisfies Washington of its compliance, by whatever standards the terrorist superpower chooses to impose. Honduras refused to form even a token National Commission of Reconciliation. After domestic protest, it finally did so two days before the deadline, on November 3, but, as President Azcona explained, the Commission "will not do anything" and will only serve to "fulfill a requirement."<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT13" HREF="#FN13">13</A></SUP></FONT> Hence with regard to internal problems too, the accords are dead as far as Honduras is concerned.

<P>The accords call for establishment of "justice, freedom and democracy" in the states of the region, and these are serious problems in Honduras. The country is under effective military rule behind a thin civilian facade, and as the U.S. moved to convert it into a military base in the 1980s, human rights violations substantially increased. Hundreds of thousands of peasants are starving to death in the south while the country exports food. Thousands have been forcefully expelled by the contras from the areas where the government denies their existence. The head of the Christian Democratic Party reports that "there is institutional torture, there are more than 150 disappeared people, there are assassinations and exiles, and capital punishment is legal, as can be seen by assassinations carried out by the state." Thousands of peasants, unemployed people, and common criminals have been imprisoned for years without trial. Much of the state terror is traceable to a CIA-trained elite battalion, a standard pattern. The leader of a peasant organization, one of 14 suspected "subversives" arrested by the police in October, stated that he was tortured to force him to confess links to guerrillas. Police and soldiers arrested, tortured and killed students and peasants in a series of October actions. Ramon Custodio, president of the Commission for the Defense of Human Rights in Central America and of the Honduran Human Rights Commission, stated in late October that killings by the security forces are becoming "more blatant," citing the murder of a trade union leader, unarmed young men, and 30 criminals, and adding that "political prisoners are not given the chance to be taken alive." As the first three-month phase of the accords ended, he stated at an international press conference (reported in the Mexican press) that the human rights situation had become worse in Honduras since 1985: "Before there was talk of disappearances and torture; now they simply kill...." including army deserters, who are killed when captured. He added that the human rights situations "have deteriorated" in Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras since the accords were signed, so that "the little hope there is that human rights will improve in the region is steadily decreasing."<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT14" HREF="#FN14">14</A></SUP></FONT>

<P>Such continuing atrocities, and the refusal of the government to undertake the steps required by the accords, pass without comment in the Free Press, which also fails to note that the accords stress the need to overcome "profound divisions" within each society and that the mechanisms proposed are aimed at establishing "justice" as well as <I>meaningful</I> democracy, not merely empty forms designed to ensure the funding of repression by a compliant Congress that pretends not to see.

<P>In the terror states, Guatemala and El Salvador, the question of compliance with the accords can scarcely be raised, and no one is raising it. Consider freedom of the press. We hear a great deal about <CITE>La Prensa,</CITE> including many fabrications, for example, that this is the journal that courageously opposed Somoza; in fact, when the owners made clear their commitment to the old order of privilege and exploitation, the editor left with 80% of the staff to form <CITE>El Nuevo Diario,</CITE> which can fairly claim to be the successor to <CITE>La Prensa,</CITE> if a newspaper is defined in terms of its editor and staff, not its owners and plant. <CITE>La Prensa</CITE> was suspended by the government the day after the U.S. effectively declared war on Nicaragua, in the terms used by elated Reagan administration officials as the Democrat-controlled House passed the contra aid bill. <CITE>La Prensa</CITE> was funded by the terrorist superpower attacking Nicaragua, and the journal supported this attack. The fact that it had been allowed to publish at all has few if any precedents. Now it is publishing again, still supporting the war against Nicaragua while the superpower conducting the war provides it with "essential" funding according to its director, contra supporter Jaime Chamorro; again, an unprecedented phenomenon. We should also bear in mind the unreported fact that in much of Nicaragua, radio and television are dominated by the United States and its client states, demonizing the Sandinistas in the manner that has been so effective at home and inducing people in areas where this is the prime "information" source to "dread the Sandinistas as if they were the devil incarnate," as Joe Eldridge reports in a study of Nicaraguan refugees in Honduras.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT15" HREF="#FN15">15</A></SUP></FONT> One should not underestimate the means available to a terrorist superpower that operates with few domestic constraints.

<P>Let us turn now to freedom of the press in Washington's terror states. In El Salvador there was once an independent press: <CITE>La Cronica</CITE> and <CITE>El Independiente.</CITE> They were not funded by a superpower attacking El Salvador, and they were not censored. Rather, one paper was closed when army tanks surrounded its offices after a series of attacks including the machine-gunning of a 14-year-old newsboy and bombing and assassination attempts that drove the editor out of the country; the other was closed when the security forces seized the editor and an associate, disembowelled them with machetes, and shot them. Is anyone calling for the reopening of <CITE>La Cronica</CITE> and <CITE>El Independiente</CITE>? Of course not, for two good and sufficient reasons: (1) Washington has commanded us to focus on <CITE>La Prensa</CITE> and Nicaragua, where nothing remotely comparable has happened, and being loyal cowards, we naturally obey; (2) the idea of opening an independent press in El Salvador is absurd. It would be necessary to send in an international army to deter the U.S.-run security forces and prevent the murder of the staff, if such media ever approached the condition that according to U.S. law justifies state control over speech: that is, if they posed a "clear and present danger," namely, to the system of privilege maintained by U.S. violence.

<P>Accordingly, we do not speak of freedom of press in El Salvador. Or in Guatemala, where there has also been no censorship, and no reporting of such trivialities as the slaughter of tens of thousands of people in the past decade. The reason for the oversight is that some 50 journalists were murdered by the security forces, some in spectacular fashion. There is therefore no need for censorship, which we abhor.

<P>Meanwhile U.S. government propaganda relayed by the media as "news" assures us that Duarte "gave the rebels free access to the press" (<CITE>New York Times</CITE> Central America correspondent James LeMoyne)<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT16" HREF="#FN16">16</A></SUP></FONT>; technically true, since no law bars such access, only the workings of the market supplemented by state terror.

<P>The real attitudes of U.S. elites towards freedom of the press are revealed further by the response to events elsewhere during the same period. In the Philippines, the government closed three radio stations and threatened others on October 7, accusing them of "glorifying the enemies of the Government and openly defying the Government of President Aquino by continuously transmitting the propaganda of right-wing rebel groups and other enemies of the state." This "crackdown on the media" was reported, but without comment, along with the outlawing of the opposition (Communist) party that had been legalized by the Marcos dictatorship, police raids against "suspected communists," and government authorization of vigilante groups -- that is, death squads.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT17" HREF="#FN17">17</A></SUP></FONT> There were no calls for organizing a "democratic resistance" to overthrow this "totalitarian" state, though they would be heard quickly enough if Aquino were to undertake measures of social reform and democratization that would threaten the interests of U.S. corporations or the U.S. bases.

<P>The major U.S. client state, which is endlessly lauded as a stellar democracy, provides even more dramatic insight into the real principles that animate those who courageously condemn Nicaraguan "totalitarianism." Shortly after <CITE>La Prensa</CITE> was suspended, Israel permanently closed two Jerusalem newspapers on the grounds that "although we offer them freedom of expression...it is forbidden to permit them to exploit this freedom in order to harm the State of Israel." The closure was upheld by the High Court on the grounds that "It is inconceivable that the State of Israel should allow terrorist organizations which seek to destroy it to set up businesses in its territory, legitimate as they may be"; the government had accused these two Arab newspapers of receiving support from hostile groups. To my knowledge, the only mention of these facts in a daily newspaper was in a letter of mine in the <CITE>Boston Globe.</CITE> As <CITE>La Prensa</CITE> was reopened, Israel closed a Nazareth political journal, alleging that it supports the PLO, and shut down an Arab-owned news office in Nablus on a similar charge, all "legal" under the state of emergency that has been in force since 1948.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT18" HREF="#FN18">18</A></SUP></FONT> None of this was reported here; <CITE>New York Times</CITE> correspondent Thomas Friedman chose the day of the closing of the Nablus office to produce one of his regular odes to freedom of expression in Israel.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT19" HREF="#FN19">19</A></SUP></FONT> Similarly, the destruction of the independent press in El Salvador never merited an editorial comment in the <CITE>Times,</CITE> along with numerous other atrocities, even the assassination of the Archbishop with the apparent complicity of the security forces.

<P>The libertarian passions of U.S. elites are very precisely focused, much as in the case of other commissars, who condemn abuses in U.S. domains while lauding the progress towards freedom in the "peoples' democracies."

<P>In other respects as well, the terror states cannot comply with the accords as long as the U.S.-backed security forces remain in command, tolerating the civilian facade as long as it can extort money from the U.S. Congress, much of it a bribe to the wealthy that flows back to U.S. banks. Consider the National Commissions of Reconciliation called for by the accords. In Nicaragua, the Commission, formed in August, is headed by Cardinal Obando, the most vocal and prominent critic of the regime. In El Salvador it is headed by Alvaro Maga?a [accented character did not scan -- JBE.], the conservative banker who was the U.S. candidate for president in 1982, therefore president, and was virtually limited to the right wing. This does not even approach the level of black humor, which is perhaps why it is passed over in silence, just as the outright refusal of Honduras to appoint even a farcical Commission was not reported in the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> for 5 weeks, and its subsequent fate, barely noted.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT20" HREF="#FN20">20</A></SUP></FONT> In Guatemala, the Archbishop, an outspoken defender of human rights, was not even nominated by the Church, no doubt by prearrangement with the military-run government.

<P>In both of the terror states, the security forces maintain obedience by violence. According to the Church human rights office Tutela Legal, in El Salvador "death squad killings jumped from an average of four to five per month during the first part of this year to around 10 per month in September and October," higher still in November.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT21" HREF="#FN21">21</A></SUP></FONT> Chris Norton, the only U.S. journalist reporting regularly from El Salvador, observes (abroad) that the real numbers are unknown because most death squad killings "have taken place in rural areas and few of them have been reported." Amadeo Ramos, one of the founders of the Indian Association ANIS, reports that an Indian settlement was bombed by the army and "the bodies of several Indians were found in a remote area thrown in a ditch" in mid-November.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT22" HREF="#FN22">22</A></SUP></FONT> To mention a few cases in San Salvador itself, two activists of the Mothers of the Disappeared (CoMadres) were abducted by Treasury police on September 3, two days after the head of the University of El Salvador Employees Union was kidnapped by heavily armed men. In another case, which was actually reported here, the president of the Human Rights Commission, Herbert Anaya, was murdered while taking his children to school. A former president, Marianela Garcia Villas, had been killed by security forces on the pretext that she was a guerrilla, and other members had been murdered or "disappeared" by the security forces. Anaya had been arrested and tortured by the Treasury police in May 1986, along with other Commission members. While in prison, they continued their work, compiling a 160-page report of testimony of over 430 political prisoners, who gave details of their torture, in one case, electrical torture by a North American major in uniform. This report, one of the most explicit and comprehensive in existence for any country, was smuggled out of the prison, along with a videotape of testimony, and distributed to the U.S. media, which had no interest in material so lacking in ideological serviceability. After Anaya was released in a prisoner exchange, he was repeatedly denounced by the government and threatened, also informed that he headed a list of Commission workers to be killed. Lacking the protection that might have been afforded by some media visibility here, he was killed, probably by death squads associated with the security forces, as indicated by Archbishop Rivera y Damas in an unreported statement.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT23" HREF="#FN23">23</A></SUP></FONT>

<P>As in the past, labor activists are a primary target. In violation of congressional legislation, the U.S. Trade Representative rejected an Americas Watch petition to review El Salvador "solely on the grounds that it is appropriate for the Salvadoran armed forces to arrest, interrogate, and imprison trade unionists whom the Department of State considers to be opponents of the Duarte Government" (Americas Watch). The petition cited numerous examples of state terror directed against the labor movement, a matter of no interest here. As in the case of freedom of press, concern over labor rights is precisely focused among U.S. elites: Poland and Nicaragua, but not the client states such as El Salvador and Israel, where the "socialist" trade union is in the forefront of the denial of minimal rights to the Palestinian workers who provide cheap labor under abysmal conditions.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT24" HREF="#FN24">24</A></SUP></FONT>

<P>The severe violations of the accords by Duarte's security forces and the lethal network associated with them pass with little comment in a terrorist culture, where the Free Press assures us that President Duarte "has gone considerably further [than the Sandinistas] in carrying out the letter of the treaty" though perhaps he too is not "particularly committed to its spirit of reconciliation," since he "is trying to split the leftist rebel alliance" -- nothing more (James LeMoyne).<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT25" HREF="#FN25">25</A></SUP></FONT>

<P>The official story throughout has been that Duarte represents the "moderate center," unable to control the "violence by both ultrarightists and by the Marxist guerrillas" (James LeMoyne)<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT26" HREF="#FN26">26</A></SUP></FONT>; an accompanying photo shows New York Mayor Koch being greeted by the Defense Minister, General Vides Casanova, who presided over the slaughter of some 60,000 people, in accord with his doctrine that "the armed forces are prepared to kill 200,000-300,000, if that's what it takes to stop a Communist takeover." In the irrelevant world of fact, as the <CITE>Times</CITE> has occasionally conceded in the small print, the violence has overwhelmingly been traceable to the security forces. A <CITE>Times</CITE> editorial noted the Anaya assassination -- as a proof of Duarte's "courage" in "defying" the death squads for which he has long served as a fig leaf. This reaction demonstrates that there are no limits to tolerance of virtuous atrocities. Buried in a news story, the same day, is the fact that the killers were using sophisticated weapons available only to the "right-wing death squads" -- that is, the assassination squads of Duarte's security forces, as <CITE>Times</CITE> editors and correspondents know, but will not say.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT27" HREF="#FN27">27</A></SUP></FONT> Meanwhile President Duarte, in his usual manner, blamed the left for the assassination, just as he has regularly blamed the victims for their torture and murder by the security forces that he praises for their "valiant services," from the moment that he took over the role of "bag man" for the military, in the appropriate phrase of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs -- or as the media prefer, the role of "centrist-leftist" (James LeMoyne),<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT28" HREF="#FN28">28</A></SUP></FONT> valiantly crusading for democracy and social justice.

<P>Expressing its utter contempt for the Guatemala accords, the Duarte government passed an amnesty lauded by the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> as its "most concrete step toward complying with the regional peace accord" since Duarte has now "released almost all political prisoners," a step contrasted with the refusal of the Sandinistas to comply apart from "tentative" and grudging steps.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT29" HREF="#FN29">29</A></SUP></FONT> The amnesty, bitterly opposed by human rights groups, labor and the church, eliminated the remote possibility of any punishment for the murderers and torturers who conducted the terror that demolished the popular organizations, destroyed the independent media, wiped out the political opposition, killed thousands of union activists, and effectively traumatized the population in the U.S. crusade to eliminate the threat of democracy and social reform. In Canada's leading journal, it is described as "an amnesty for the military and the death squads" in an article headlined "Duarte ceasefire designed to fail, diplomats say"<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT30" HREF="#FN30">30</A></SUP></FONT>; in Canada the Party Line is more difficult to enforce. As for the incidental release of hundreds of political prisoners, the chief of staff of Costa Rica's Foreign Ministry, Luis Solis, observed that the amnesty would put them at the mercy of the death squads, who are "probably hiring people to go out and shoot at the ones who are going to be released," quite secure that they will be protected for their crimes. The <CITE>Washington Post</CITE> notes in passing that "90 percent of the approximately 1,000 political prisoners in El Salvador had been in custody for more than four years without a trial," and that many fear their release to the mercy of the death squads.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT31" HREF="#FN31">31</A></SUP></FONT> The Guatemalan military had declared a similar amnesty, for themselves, as they permitted a civilian government to operate under their control so as to obtain U.S. funds to rescue the country from the economic chaos they had created while conducting mass slaughter with enthusiastic U.S. support.

<P>Meanwhile moralists here ponder the dilemmas of the "moderate center" concocted for their benefit by the State Department Office of Public Diplomacy, which has the task of controlling what high Reagan administration officials describe as "enemy territory," that is, the domestic population.

<P>To appreciate just how extreme was the Salvadoran gesture of contempt for the accords, we can return to the irrelevant facts. The accords call for amnesty decrees "setting out all the steps to guarantee the inviolability of all forms of life and liberty, material goods and the safety of the people to benefit from said decrees" -- exactly what is declared unthinkable by the Duarte government as it declares amnesty for the killers and torturers to the admiring applause of the Free Press.

<P>While in the United States, Duarte is lauded for courageously leading El Salvador to "democracy," the reaction at home is different. Public opinion polls conducted by the Central America University in El Salvador in early 1987 reveal that half the population "think that nothing has changed" under Duarte, 18% think that the situation has deteriorated, and a rousing 10% agree with the U.S. media that "there is a process of democracy and freedom in the country at present." On a visit to Holland in October 1987, Duarte was criticized for human rights abuses while officials privately expressed unhappiness about the visit, taken at his initiative.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT32" HREF="#FN32">32</A></SUP></FONT> In Latin America, the reaction is harsher. On a trip to Uruguay, Argentina and Brazil, Duarte was bitterly denounced by Christian Democratic leaders and others and refused permission to address the General Assembly in Uruguay, while in Argentina half the delegates left the chamber as he spoke and in Brazil, fewer than 10% of the members attended and he was greeted with angry demonstrations and accusations of being a genocidal murderer. In the Free Press, one will find little mention of how our hero is perceived in countries that have had some experience with U.S.-backed killers.

<P>In the second of the terror states, the situation is hardly different. Americas Watch reports 25 new "disappearances" and kidnappings in August 1987, in addition to 74 killings reported in the press, an unknown number being political assassinations. The Guatemalan Human Rights Commission, based in Mexico for obvious reasons, reported 572 extrajudicial executions and 142 "disappearances" from mid-January to March 1987. Other sources estimate about 50 political assassinations a month in 1987. Nineth de Garcia, Guatemala's leading human rights activist, reported in late November, for the benefit of the Canadian reader, that "the level of political kidnapping and murder is on the increase" since the accords were signed.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT33" HREF="#FN33">33</A></SUP></FONT> As in El Salvador and Honduras, the poor are press-ganged into military service while the rich are exempt, and general poverty and misery mount while the wealthy enjoy the benefits of efficient state terror. In all three countries, the military remain firmly in command, serving the interests of U.S. investors, the local oligarchy, and in El Salvador, the new elites who are riding Duarte's coattails for their share in corruption and robbery. In short, "democracy," American-style.

<P>The rule of the military in the U.S.-backed terror states is illustrated by their complete immunity from prosecution for crimes that merit comparison to Pol Pot. All of this is acceptable, even described as "democracy," in the terrorist superpower that has directed and supported the necessary purge of the societies. Honduras differs primarily in that the repression has been less bloody, or to be more accurate, more indirect: starvation and slow, cruel death rather than torture, rape, murder and mutilation. I put aside Costa Rica, also now dependent on U.S. aid for survival, though a serious inquiry into the provisions of the accord for "justice, freedom and democracy" and access by "all ideological groups" to the media (a virtual monopoly of the ultra-right) would reveal that their terms are far from realized here, despite much sanctimonious rhetoric.

<P>The conclusion, then, is that in the U.S. client states of Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala, there is no possibility that the accords will be implemented. The Guatemalan <CITE>Central America Report</CITE> observes that "of the five Central American countries, the Nicaraguans have by far done the most to meet the requirements of the Guatemala Plan, and in some cases have made conciliatory gestures not indicated in the plan," citing examples.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT34" HREF="#FN34">34</A></SUP></FONT> Here, no one discusses the matter, because all of this is off the agenda according to Washington orders, along with the even more serious U.S. actions to undermine the accords. From the first days after the accords were signed, the media assured us that whatever may appear in the irrelevant text, "there is no doubt that [the treaty's] main provisions are principally directed at Nicaragua and will affect Nicaragua more than any of the other nations that signed the accord" -- which is certainly true, under the conditions of obedience dictated by Washington, though this was presumably not the point intended by James LeMoyne. As he explained further, the Sandinistas are "in a somewhat exposed position" because they, and they alone, "are under close scrutiny for their efforts to carry out the Central American peace treaty" -- as dictated by Washington, whose orders are naturally binding.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT35" HREF="#FN35">35</A></SUP></FONT> <CITE>Times</CITE> correspondent Stephen Kinzer informed us that the peace accord "requires Nicaragua to permit full press and political freedom" while requiring "other countries in the region to stop supporting" the contras; a half-truth that amounts to a lie, since the accord also requires the other states to permit full press and political freedom, which is inconceivable as long as the security forces are not dismantled and the U.S. remains in command.

<P>I do not mean to suggest that Kinzer is incapable of outright falsehoods, for example, his statement in the same column that the Nicaraguan government refused to allow the "Roman Catholic radio station to broadcast news." This is one of his favorite tales, repeated in several other columns and by LeMoyne as well,<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT36" HREF="#FN36">36</A></SUP></FONT> along with the claim that the Ministry of Interior refused to comment on the matter (Oct. 20). AP reported the same day the statement of the Interior Ministry that "Radio Catolica may broadcast news, but must apply for the legally required permission for the program and register the name of its director, the broadcast time and other information" -- not exactly a decisive proof that this is a totalitarian dungeon.

<P>These and other commentators surely understand that even if Nicaragua is willing to overlook the fact that by orders from Washington, the terms of the accord are inapplicable to the U.S. client states, as of course to itself, still Nicaragua can hardly relax its guard as long as the U.S. persists in its outspoken commitment to overthrow the government by violence. Perhaps it is for this reason that the <CITE>Times</CITE> does not report such matters as CIA-run supply flights to the proxy army, the attempts to bribe Miskito Indian leaders, or Operation "Blazing Trail 1987" and other U.S. measures to ensure that Nicaragua will be compelled to maintain a state of permanent mobilization against the threat of outright U.S. invasion. In the West, threatening military maneuvers are regarded as tantamount to aggression, justifying a pre-emptive strike in response. Thus when Arab armies deployed in May 1967, the Israeli attack in response was considered quite legitimate: how can Israel be expected to sustain a mobilization for more than a few days? Israel was not an impoverished country under attack by a terrorist superpower, but when the U.S. carries out regular military maneuvers on Nicaragua's borders along with overflights, naval operations nearby, even the deployment of 50,000 troops designed to draw the army away from population defense so as to facilitate the attack against "soft targets" by U.S.-run terrorists, there is not a word of protest in elite circles -- apart from protest over Nicaragua's unconscionable attempt to arm itself in self-defense. These facts too provide us with some insight into our political culture.

<P>Let us put aside any further discussion of the irrelevant facts and turn to the world of illusion constructed by Washington. That is, we now turn to the Orwellian version of the accords -- the operative version, given the realities of power.


<H3>The Operative Illusions</H3>

<P>According to the U.S. version, the sole question is whether the accords will be implemented by Nicaragua -- according to the standards set by Washington. These standards were readily predictable from the start. Since Washington is determined to undermine the agreements, any respect in which Nicaragua adheres to them is off the agenda. We are permitted to discuss some element of the accords only if Washington's interpretation differs from Nicaragua's, so that Nicaragua is in violation -- by definition. The task of the media, then, is to conduct a parody of the sciences. In the sciences, one confronts some puzzling facts and attempts to devise principles that will explain them. In ideological warfare, one begins with Higher Truths dictated from above. The task is to select the facts, or to invent them, in such a way as to render the required conclusions not too transparently absurd -- at least for properly disciplined minds.

<P>Accordingly the media, and respectable opinion generally, quickly reduced the Central American agreements to "two key points," as Stephen Kinzer explained: (1) Will Nicaragua agree to negotiate with the contras -- that is, with the civilian directorate established by the CIA as a classic Communist-style front? (2) Will Nicaragua offer an amnesty to what are called "political prisoners," including National Guardsmen arrested -- but not killed, as is the norm elsewhere under such circumstances -- after they had taken part in the slaughter of some 40,000 people?

<P>The accords say nothing about these matters, but that is further irrelevant fact. Specifically, the accords do not call for discussions with CIA-created front organizations. That the contra directorate is exactly that has long been known, and has recently been documented in detail in a monograph by Edgar Chamorro, who was selected by the CIA to serve as spokesman for the front created as part of the disinformation campaign designed by the State Department for "enemy territory" at home (<CITE>Packaging the Contras,</CITE> Institute for Media Analysis). Robert Owen, Oliver North's liaison with the contras, described the civilian front as "a name only," "a creation of the United States government (USG) to garner support from Congress"; power lies in the hands of the Somozist-run FDN headed by Adolfo Calero, who "is a creation of the USG and so he is the horse we chose to ride," though he is surrounded by people who are "liars and greed- and power-motivated" for whom the war is "a business" as they hope for the marines to restore them to the power they lost.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT37" HREF="#FN37">37</A></SUP></FONT> Washington, with the docile media in tow, focuses on the issue of negotiations with its creation as part of the effort to establish the fiction that the proxy army is an indigenous guerrilla force, comparable to the guerrillas in El Salvador who were driven to the hills by U.S.-backed state terror, have always fought within their country, receive little if any military aid from abroad, have nothing like the extraordinary intelligence and support system provided by the terrorist superpower, and face a military force far more powerful than the army of Nicaragua. Notice further that negotiation of a cease-fire with authentic guerrilla forces is hardly likely to succeed, as the show negotiations in El Salvador and Guatemala illustrate, and in the case of Washington's proxies, the U.S. can readily disrupt any progress. The issue, then, is marginal, as compared with such crucial matters as Washington's unlawful use of force and state terror in the client states. But naturally Washington will seek to restrict attention to this issue, and commentary here has obeyed, including the doves.

<P>As for amnesty, as we have seen, El Salvador acted at once to violate this directive in the most blatant fashion, as Guatemala had already done when the military declared amnesty for itself. Nicaragua had an amnesty decree that approximates the stated conditions of the accord, apart from the state of siege, which Nicaragua has announced will remain in force until the U.S. war is brought to a halt, a position that we would accept as legitimate in the case of any client state, or the United States itself if it were under attack or threat. It was also accepted as legitimate by the Verification Commission made up of the foreign ministers of 13 Latin American nations including the five Central American countries. In their November 8 report, they agreed that Nicaragua's amnesty may legitimately remain conditional on termination of aid to the contras and use of foreign territory to attack Nicaragua. A senior Latin American diplomat commented: "Nicaragua does not have to implement amnesty until Honduras kicks out the contras and the Americans stop helping them." Rephrasing the facts in official <CITE>Times</CITE> Newspeak: under the provisions of the accords, "no country in the region would be permitted to assist the contras once the Sandinistas establish full political freedom" (Stephen Kinzer).<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT38" HREF="#FN38">38</A></SUP></FONT>

<P>The accords charge the Verification Commission with the responsibility "to verify and monitor the commitments contained in this document." But this is unacceptable to Washington, because the Commission is less subject to U.S. influence than the Central American client states, who therefore must be assigned the role of monitors. For the same reason, a Contadora agreement was completely unacceptable to Washington, whereas a Central American agreement could barely be tolerated. The more fanatic contra lobbyists go so far as to inform us that the devious Ortega "tipped his hand" at the OAS when he said that "it is up to the International Verification and Monitoring Commission...to determine who is complying with the Guatemala accords," exactly as the text says, instead of the Central American presidents, as Washington would prefer given its power over them (Robert Leiken); note how brazenly Ortega defies Washington orders. More subtle apologists report that "the decision" over "the accord's fate" lies in the hands of "the two superpowers" and their respective clients, thus adopting the framework of cold war confrontation demanded by Washington (James LeMoyne).<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT39" HREF="#FN39">39</A></SUP></FONT>

<P>The Nicaraguan amnesty was extended after the accords, including about 1000 prisoners, but few National Guardsmen. The press, following Washington directives, speaks of eight to ten thousand "political prisoners," but Americas Watch, in a detailed review, demonstrates that the figures are largely fabricated, and that these are not "political prisoners" in the sense used in the West; its February 1987 report lists <I>two</I> political prisoners in this sense, one since released. Reviewing the records of the Red Cross, Amnesty International, and its own investigations, Americas Watch estimated that apart from common criminals (including 600 members of the army and police sentenced for crimes against the population, a possibility unimaginable in the terror states), the prisons contained about 2200 National Guardsmen and 1500 people charged with security-related crimes. The report is worth reading for its critical assessment of these matters, but that is the real world, not the Orwellian world of Washington and its minions.

<P>In the latter world, along with numerous other fantasies, Robert Leiken states that "figures on Nicaraguan political prisoners...range from a low of 4,300 (Americas Watch and the Nicaraguan government)" to the much higher claims that he has relayed.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT40" HREF="#FN40">40</A></SUP></FONT> Putting aside the interesting reading of the Americas Watch report, note the none-too-subtle juxtaposition of Americas Watch and the Nicaraguan government, in obedience to Washington's longstanding attempts to undermine authentic human rights organizations.

<P>The <CITE>New York Times</CITE> review of the progress of the accords after the "historic deadline" of November 7<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT41" HREF="#FN41">41</A></SUP></FONT> conforms precisely to the dictates of the Office of Public Diplomacy. In the survey article of November 8 by James LeMoyne, the behavior of the United States is unmentioned and nothing is said about its client states. The article focuses on one issue: the Sandinista decision to enter negotiations with the CIA civilian front, with Cardinal Obando -- their most prominent antagonist -- as intermediary; a remarkable choice, since only a neutral party is considered an appropriate "intermediary" apart from the Orwellian world established by reigning power, and a hazardous move, since Obando can be expected to blame the Sandinistas if the negotations collapse, as elsewhere. This decision, LeMoyne explains, is a great victory for the United States, because its creation thus gains the status of "a legitimate belligerent force." The implication, drawn explicitly by administration officials the same day, is that "we've learned from this...that pressure works, and that we must keep that pressure on."<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT42" HREF="#FN42">42</A></SUP></FONT> The truth of the matter is that pressure works to keep the media in line, though this victory is only a shade less difficult than the glorious conquest of Grenada.

<P>Accompanying LeMoyne's agitprop is a photograph of a rally in Managua with this caption: "Nicaraguans cheering President Daniel Ortega Saavedra as he announced that his Sandinista Government would agree to indirect negotiations with the contras on a cease-fire." The reader is to understand, then, that the people of Nicaragua are overjoyed over this contra victory, in accord with <CITE>Times</CITE> doctrine. In the forefront of the photo is a cheering woman wearing an FSLN (Sandinista) T-shirt. There are three signs visible. One states that "the others should comply," since Nicaragua had already complied with the accords. A second reads: "Popular power cannot be discussed after 26 years of [the people's] struggle," a familiar Sandinista slogan. The third, not entirely readable, apparently calls for closing of <CITE>La Prensa.</CITE> Not precisely what the <CITE>Times</CITE> is laboring to convey.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT43" HREF="#FN43">43</A></SUP></FONT>

<P>It would be an error to describe such media subservience as totalitarianism in the Stalinist or Nazi style. In totalitarian states, those who serve power have the excuse of fear. Here we see, rather, a form of voluntary servitude, a remarkable and pervasive feature of the intellectual culture.

<P>For its first commentary on the initial three-month phase of the accords, the <CITE>Times</CITE> selected James Chace, a noted dove. Accordingly, he expressed pleasure with the progress on all fronts, even Nicaragua, where President Ortega "has agreed to negotiate indirectly with the contras," thus indicating that at last "the Sandinistas seem determined to fulfill the main provisions" of the agreement, as defined by Washington. But "there is still, of course, a long way to go" in consummating the accords, because "the Sandinistas have not yet declared a general amnesty or lifted the state of emergency." Apart from continued Sandinista obstruction, Chace sees no problems during the three-month period, though as a dove, he opposes renewed contra aid and criticizes the Reagan administration for remaining "suspicious and hostile," while conceding that it has good grounds, since "the Guatemala agreement does not provide for reductions in Soviet aid to Managua" so that "America's legitimate security concerns" are not addressed. Among the topics unmentioned are: U.S. actions to undermine the accords; the violation of their essential provisions by the U.S. client states; the fact that "Soviet aid to Managua" was a major achievement of the Reagan administration, which blocked aid from elsewhere while launching an attack on Nicaragua, and that the Guatemala agreement also does not provide for reductions in U.S. aid to its client states; that others, besides the beleaguered and helpless United States, have "legitimate security concerns," among them Nicaragua and the victims of U.S. aid in the terror states; that Managua has long offered to exclude foreign advisers and negotiate verifiable security guarantees, efforts successfully blocked by Washington; that if Nicaragua poses "security concerns" for the United States, then Luxembourg poses security concerns for the Soviet Union, and Denmark, a member of a hostile military alliance, poses far greater concerns, so that the USSR is entitled, by our principles, to organize terrorist forces to attack and overthrow their governments unless they agree to disarm and offer verifiable guarantees that they will no longer threaten the Soviet Union. In short, the very model of a well-behaved dove, as designed by the Office of Public Diplomacy.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT44" HREF="#FN44">44</A></SUP></FONT>

<P>As always, it is the duty of the liberal doves to set the limits of thinkable thought. This has always been the essence of the American system of indoctrination, brilliantly effective among the educated classes, though "enemy territory" remains out of control, a continuing problem.

<P>Putting irrelevant fact aside, the operative question today is whether Washington can convert the "key issues" it designates into a justification for expanding the war against Nicaragua. The problem that arose after Nicaragua's offer to negotiate with the CIA civilian front can surely be overcome by U.S. propaganda and military operations. As we have seen, the latter were immediately escalated in accord with the dedication of the terrorist superpower to the unlawful use of force, with the compliance of the doves, who loyally evade this unwelcome issue. Washington has also attempted in other ways to elicit a hostile Nicaraguan response that might be utilized by the State Department Office of Public Diplomacy in its struggles in "enemy territory" at home. The Reagan administration sent Secretary of Education William Bennett, Jeane Kirkpatrick, and assorted contra supporters (David Horowitz, Ronald Radosh, etc.) to Nicaragua, where they delivered inflammatory public addresses denouncing the Sandinistas and praising the U.S. proxy army attacking Nicaragua, prominently reported in the press (with approval, in <CITE>La Prensa</CITE>). But unfortunately, these efforts elicited no reaction that could be exploited for propaganda purposes.

<P>We might, incidentally, ask what would happen if a Libyan official or Qaddafi enthusiast were to arrive in Tel Aviv to deliver a public address praising Abu Nidal. Or suppose a Japanese cabinet minister had landed in Washington in 1942 (when the national territory was not under attack or even threat -- in fact, it had not been threatened since the War of 1812) to deliver diatribes about American racism and injustice and to call for the forceful overthrow of the government by the "freedom fighters" then liberating the Philippines and other Western colonies. We need not speculate, since as distinct from totalitarian Nicaragua, Israel and the United States would never tolerate any such act for one instant. In fact, the U.S. has barred even anti-Sandinista Nicaraguan legislators who are opposed to contra aid, mothers tortured by Duarte's security services who were invited by NOW to speak in New England towns, a delegate from the Salvadoran Human Rights Commission to a UN session on disarmament and development that the U.S. boycotted, among many others -- for example, the Canadian publisher of several of my books, still barred from our sacred soil because he opposed U.S. aggression in Indochina. All such matters are off the agenda, and in our extraordinary imperial arrogance, we take for granted that Nicaragua must tolerate the infantile antics and vulgar abuse that are a Washington specialty, in a manner that no other state would endure -- surely not the U.S. or its allies.

<P>The attack against Nicaragua and the programs of state terror to suppress democracy and social reform in the client states reflect an elite consensus. That is why they are not discussed in any minimally serious way. The media will not expose what they know to be true, and Congress will not constrain the terrorist commanders as long as they seem to be succeeding in their tasks. The fate of the Central American accords lies in the hands of the domestic enemy of the state, the citizens in "enemy territory" at home. As so often in the past, dissent, protest, pressures of a wide variety that escape elite control can modify the calculus of costs of planners, and offer a slight hope that Washington can be compelled to permit at least some steps towards "justice, freedom and democracy" within its domains.

<P><I>Letter from Lexington</I>

<P>Dear LOOT,

<P>Credit where credit is due. Often there is a lot to learn from the mainstream press. Take the May 23 issue of <CITE>Business Week,</CITE> which features a study on "The Workplace" headed: "Why America Needs Unions, But Not The Kind It Has Now." The article reports that "Over the past dozen years, in fact, U.S. industry has conducted one of the most successful union wars ever," with a "chilling effect." Why "chilling"? After all, "Numerous studies have confirmed that unions reduce profits," and what could be more noble than overcoming a threat to the guiding human value to which the journal, along with right-thinking people generally, is dedicated? The reason is that "the higher productivity of unionized companies offsets most of their higher costs." Thus unions may "perform a legitimate role that's not counter to social efficiency," Chicago economist Gary Becker observes. From the other end of the spectrum, fellow-Nobel laureate Paul Samuelson adds that "if unions help improve productivity..., they can justify higher wages and their existence." And as remains unstated, unions can serve as labor contractors, providing an orderly workforce and guarantees of stability over a long stretch, a matter of particular significance to capital-intensive industry. If "labor embraces cooperation with unprecedented enthusiasm" and unions "reinvent themselves" so that they "help employers win competitive battles," then organized labor "may win at least grudging acceptance and carve out a place in the global economy." Note the crucial term: "acceptance" -- by the rulers, as tacitly understood.

<P>The article is frank about the purpose and nature of the bitter and one-sided class war. Management's basic goal has been to undermine the rights "guaranteed by the 1935 Wagner Act." In fact, that has been a basic goal since the tragedy occurred 60 years ago, and although the project of reversing the victory for democracy and working people was put on hold during the World War, it was taken up again when peace arrived, with great vigor and considerable success.

<P>Nevertheless, some rights are still guaranteed by law. But this is a mere technicality, as the editors recognize without comment. The basic method of the "successful antiunion war" was "illegally firing thousands of workers for exercising their rights to organize." Thus "employers illegally fired 1 of every 36 union supporters during organizing drives in the late 1980s, vs. 1 in 110 in the late '70s and 1 in 209 in the late '60s." "Unlawful firings occurred in one-third of all representation elections in the late '80s, vs. 8% in the late '60s." "Even more significant than the numbers is the perception of risk among workers, who think they'll be fired in an organizing campaign," Harvard law professor Paul Weiler comments. The effects are rather like those of the mislabeled "free trade agreements." The threat of job transfer suffices to drive wages and working conditions down in the wealthier countries, while good behavior is guaranteed among the most impoverished by terror and repression, and huge growth of the labor force. The latter is another welcome effect of the same economic regimen, designed to replace production for local markets by agroexport and assembly plants for transnationals that expand "free trade" by the centrally-managed and market-distorting transactions that happen to cross international borders.

<P>Once again, the slogan "Crime doesn't Pay" is shown to be an absurdity.

<P>To be sure, criminal behavior is safer when state power is behind it. The principle is understood with particular clarity within Washington's international terror network: in Colombia, for example, now the leading human rights violator in the hemisphere and to the surprise of no one in touch with the real world, now also the leading recipient of U.S. military aid, increasing under Clinton amidst praises for Colombia's progress in realizing democratic values as its security forces conduct their grim work. The same lessons apply at home: Crime pays when the state nods in approval. The precept was cherished with particular fondness by the Reaganites, who dedicated state power even beyond the norm to welfare for the rich and openly dismissed the rule of law as mere frivolity. One effect was the expanded freedom for illegal abuse of working people. Given the open contempt for domestic law, it would also be frivolous to cite the provisions of the international conventions that we hold sacred and defend with passion against backward peoples and official enemies, when some power interest is served thereby.

<P>The illegal destruction of unions has been a major factor in lowering wages, helping to increase the gap between rich and poor to "Depression-era dimensions," <CITE>Business Week</CITE> observes.<FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1" HREF="#FN1"><SUP>1</SUP></A></FONT> It has also reduced pension and health protection while contributing to "a 125-fold explosion in unlawful-discharge suits," union protections having been undermined. Safety regulations have also lapsed, thanks to state-employer cooperation in crime. "The Occupational Safety & Health Administration under Reagan and Bush was a hands-off agency," encouraging lawlessness, and along with the dismantling of unions, such state support for criminal behavior has led to an increase in days lost to injury "from 58 per 100 workers in 1983 to 86 in 1991."

<P>Some of the effects are illustrated by the current recovery. Not only is it unusually sluggish, with half the normal growth during recovery from recession and one-third the normal rate of job growth in the first 36 months, but it is unusual in that wages and fringe benefits have stagnated, the proportion of temporary jobs is unprecedented, and the average work week has reached post-World War II highs. "Labor is scared about having any job at all," Harvard labor economist James Medoff comments: "It makes employees very weak at the bargaining table." Meanwhile "1993 was a bracingly upbeat year for the FORTUNE 500," the journal exulted in its annual review of the state of the important people, who posted "dazzling" profits despite "virtually stagnant" sales growth.<FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2" HREF="#FN2"><SUP>2</SUP></A></FONT>

<P>Class war brings other important benefits. Unions provide one of the few means by which ordinary people can enter the political arena; their decline thus undermines the threat of democracy. This is no small matter, as was revealed quite dramatically in the last stages of the NAFTA debate, when the attempts of organized labor to approach their representatives in Congress elicited extraordinary tantrums. The reaction provided a most revealing demonstration of the fear and hatred of democracy that prevails across the spectrum.

<P>Liberals were particularly incensed by the "real roughshod, muscle-bound tactics" of organized labor denounced by the President, "the raw muscle, the sort of naked pressure that the labor forces have put on" as they approached their elected representatives, even sinking to "pleading... based on friendship" and "threatening... based on money and work in the campaign," an unspeakable outrage. At the dissident extreme, Anthony Lewis condemned the "crude threatening tactics" of the "backward, unenlightened" labor movement as it sought to influence legislation. How dare working people seek to emulate corporate lobbyists, whose vastly greater "pleading" and "threatening" aroused no such reaction. Indeed it was ignored during the period when the outcome seemed in doubt, quite properly one might argue, just as the news room doesn't report the rising of the sun; that is the way "democracy" is supposed to function, after all. Even months after the arrogant upstarts were beaten down, the press was still shuddering from "all the bullying from labor organizations," while reporting Clinton's efforts to "rescue" NAFTA supporters from "labor's revenge," fortunately weak.<FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3" HREF="#FN3"><SUP>3</SUP></A></FONT> Also important is the psychological effect of the destruction of unions. It contributes to the privatization of aspirations. It helps eliminate a sense of solidarity and sympathy with others, the understanding that we are in it together and care for one another, not just ourselves. In the early days of the industrial revolution, the lively labor press protested the "new spirit of the age": "Gain wealth, forgetting all but self," a demeaning and degrading doctrine that had to be driven into people's heads with no little violence. Normal human sentiments had to be crushed; they are inconsistent with capitalist ideology, which celebrates private profit as the supreme human value and denies people rights beyond what they can salvage in the labor market.

<P>In pre-capitalist days, Adam Smith, like other founders of classical liberalism, stressed such values as sympathy and the right of creative work, offering nuanced arguments for markets on the grounds that under "perfect liberty" there should be a natural tendency towards equality, a condition for efficient market function. Such ideas had to be demolished both in practice and in the ideological sphere. It is interesting to trace the transition to the modern era, in which a very different conception of human nature has been crafted, one better suited to rule of the economy and social life by the absolutist, unaccountable, totalitarian institutions of the corporate world. For example, the conception expressed by Nobel laureate in economics James Buchanan, who instructs us that in "any person's ideal situation," "each person seeks mastery over a world of slaves."<FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT4" HREF="#FN4"><SUP>4</SUP></A></FONT> That is an idea that Smith would have considered pathological, as did the working people who were beaten into submission as industrial state capitalism gained power.

<P>These are large and important questions, very much alive, indeed a major preoccupation of the huge propaganda industry that seeks to shape human beings into the desired form: separate atoms of consumption, tools of production, and docile servants of power.

<P>The <CITE>Business Week</CITE> review advises labor "to adopt a `we're-in-this-together' mentality instead of the `us-vs.-them' one that has characterized both sides of the industrial divide for decades." But their notion of "we're in this together" is radically different from the sense of solidarity and cooperation that animated the labor movement, and non-pathological human relations generally. And they understand very well that "one side of the industrial divide" is to persist in an unremitting class war, "accepting" organized labor (as they nicely put it) only if unions learn to subordinate working people to proper goals of profit and efficiency.

<P>The Reaganite class war -- criminal, as <CITE>Business Week</CITE> casually mentions -- was matched in Thatcher's Britain, which achieved even more satisfactory results in crushing democracy, freedom, and elementary human rights. To cite merely one illustration of the successes attained, the charitable organization Action for Children, founded in 1869 with the Queen as patron, concludes that "the gap between rich and poor is as wide today as it was in Victorian times," and in some ways worse. A million and a half families cannot afford to provide their children with "the diet fed to a similar child living in a Bethnal Green Workhouse in 1876," a "sad reflection on British society."<FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT5" HREF="#FN5"><SUP>5</SUP></A></FONT>

<P>This "sad reflection" is hailed by the business world. At last, England "is doing something well," the London <CITE>Economist</CITE> announced approvingly, with "trade unions shackled by law and subdued," "unemployment high," and the Maastricht social chapter rejected so that employers are protected "from over-regulation and under-flexibility of labour" (job security). "Finally, the Payoff from Thatcher's Revolution," a headline reads in <CITE>Business Week,</CITE> which reports enthusiastically that "Britain's surprising resurgence holds some lessons for the Continent," particularly "declining labor costs," now a third less than the Western European average; lower corporate taxes; and greater "labor flexibility," as in the United States. "Credit goes largely to Margaret Thatcher, whose reforms are now bearing fruit." This "new labor market has proven a potent lure to outsiders," who are happy to use Thatcher's achievements to boost profits and to drive their own workforce down to similar levels. "When [workers] see jobs disappearing, it has a salutary effect on people's attitudes," a British manufacturing director observes in the <CITE>Wall Street Journal,</CITE> also impressed with the "payoff from Thatcher's revolution," which is leaving Britain "with a low-paid, low-skill work force." Jobs are being created thanks to the improved conditions of exploitation and the salutary attitudes they bring, but "virtually all the net new jobs have been part-time; most of them go to women and pay less than full-time jobs," and "the number of full-time British employees with weekly pay below the Council of Europe's `decency threshhold' is up to 37% from 28.3% in 1979," thanks to the new "labor flexibility" and the weakening of unions and workers' rights.<FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT6" HREF="#FN6"><SUP>6</SUP></A></FONT>

<P>During this wondrous decade, Reaganites were racing Thatcher to see who could best achieve what the <CITE>Wall Street Journal</CITE> hailed as "a welcome development of transcendent importance," the reduction of U.S. labor costs (wages, in effect) from their 1985 high -- as one would expect in the richest country in the world, with unparalleled advantages -- to well below most competitors, England aside. For a brief period in '91-'92, the U.S. even surpassed its British rival in reducing labor costs, but "Thatcher's revolution" gave England first place again, and now the U.S. ranks only second in the competition to see who can punish the general population more efficiently.<FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT7" HREF="#FN7"><SUP>7</SUP></A></FONT>

<P>Thatcher's "reforms" offer some guidelines for U.S. business. Thus in Britain, "If an employer wishes to end collective bargaining and move to personal contracts, then it is possible to offer pay rises to those willing to accept such contracts and deny pay rises to those wishing to retain union and collective bargaining rights," one of many devices used to regain Victorian standards (Keith Harper). Another useful idea, now being applied, is to force the unions to "re-recruit" their entire membership regularly, each member required to confirm in writing, every three years, his or her agreement to have union dues checked off from pay packets. The point is to impose an extraordinary burden on "the thousands of workplace volunteers who act out of commitment rather than for reward," and who must seek out six million people wherever they may be, "tying up resources of the embattled labor movement" (John Monks, head of the TUC). A comparable demand that bank standing orders and debit arrangements must be reconfirmed regularly in writing would devastate the financial system, and "for the trade union movement, that is almost exactly what is taking place right now" (Seamus Milne)<FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT8" HREF="#FN8"><SUP>8</SUP></A></FONT>

<P>The United States has already been censured by the International Labor Organization for allowing scabs ("permanent replacement workers") as strikebreakers, alone in the industrial world apart from South Africa at the time (1992) -- and soon, perhaps, losing its partner, though the idea is spreading elsewhere. But there is much progress yet to be made as labor is taught to justify its existence by showing a proper understanding of the "`we're-in-this-together' mentality" that the masters of the world prescribe.

<P>The U.S. and Britain are leading the industrial world towards sharply two-tiered societies on the Third World model, with islands of prosperity in the midst of a sea of misery and despair. The increasing mobility of capital and immobility of labor -- exactly the opposite of the assumptions on which classical economics is based -- draw others along in obvious ways.

<P>All of this is part of broader tendencies in the global economy, which have, among other effects, brought about "the worst global employment crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s," the International Labor Organization reported in January, with only the Japan-based East Asia region excepted. The huge unemployment "represents an enormous waste of human resources, reflects an important amount of inefficiency in economic systems and causes a disturbing degree of social distress," OECD reported in June, speaking only of the wealthier countries; the real catastrophe is in their traditional domains.<FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT9" HREF="#FN9"><SUP>9</SUP></A></FONT>

<P>Wherever one turns there is a desperate need for work to be done, and the unemployed would be delighted to do it, if they had a chance. The work would be highly beneficial to them and their communities -- beneficial to <I>people,</I> not <I>profits,</I> and therefore no contribution to economic health, in the technical sense. It is important to master the distinction between "the health of the economy" and human welfare, notions that can be virtually uncorrelated. All of this is one part of a catastrophic failure of the economic system, which is incapable of bringing together needed work and idle hands of suffering people. Of course, this catastrophic failure is hailed as a grand success, as indeed it is for a narrow sector of privilege -- which happens to include the people who give the speeches, write the articles, and sing the odes to our magnificence.

<P>These developments are commonly attributed to inexorable market forces -- immutable, like the principles of gravitation, as David Ricardo argued during an earlier exercise of ideological warfare. Analysts then divide over the contribution of international trade, automation, and other factors. Putting aside the absurdity of comparing human institutions, with their specific values and choices, to laws of nature, there is an element of deception in all of this. The alleged efficiencies of trade and automation are hardly attributable to the market. Huge state subsidy and intervention has always been required, and still is, to make trade appear efficient, not to speak of costs imposed on future generations who do not "vote" in the market ("externalities"). And while automation contributes to profit at some point, that point was reached by decades of protection within the state sector, as David Noble has shown. Furthermore, the specific form of automation selected was often driven by power more than profit or efficiency; it was designed to deskill workers and subordinate them to management, not because of market principles or the nature of the technology, but for reasons of domination and control.<FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT10" HREF="#FN10"><SUP>10</SUP></A></FONT>

<P>Freedom and democracy are even less tolerable in the workplace than in the larger society, under reigning values. But as John Dewey observed, echoing pre-capitalist classical liberal ideas, if workers are not "the masters of their own industrial fate" and if "the means of production, exchange, publicity, transportation and communication" are in the hands of private power, freedom and democracy remain largely illusory and politics will be "the shadow cast on society by big business." The struggle to defend these truisms -- for that is what they are -- is an unending one, with defeats and victories. The "chilling" story told by <CITE>Business Week</CITE> is one manifestation of serious defeats, which must be changed to a new dawn if still greater human catastrophes are to be averted.

<P><I>Letter from Lexington</I>

<P>Dear LOOT,

<P>Hardly a day passes without acclaim for the exciting new idea of the New World Order: free market capitalism that will liberate the energies of active and creative people, for the benefit of all. Euphoria peaked as Clinton savored his NAFTA triumph at the Asia-Pacific summit in Seattle, where he expounded his "grand vision for Asia," bringing leaders together "to preach the gospel of open markets and to secure America's foothold in the world's fastest growing economic community." This "may be the biggest rethinking of American policy toward Asia" since World War II, David Sanger observed. Clinton outlined the "new vision" before a "cheering throng... inside a giant airplane hangar at the Boeing Company," "a model for companies across America" with its "booming Asian business" -- and its plans for "multimillion-dollar job-creating investments outside the United States on a scale that would terrify NAFTA's opponents."<FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1" HREF="#FN1"><SUP>1</SUP></A></FONT>

<P>Unmentioned is another fact: Boeing is also the model for radical state intervention to shield private profit from market discipline. It would not be America's leading exporter, nor probably even exist, were it not for a huge public subsidy funneled through the Pentagon and NASA, institutions in large part designed to serve that function for high tech industry generally. Clinton's gospel, then, is that the taxpayer should provide massive welfare payments to investors and their agents, safely protected within their totalitarian institutions from interference by public or workforce, pursuing profit and market share as they choose, by "job-creating investments" abroad if that suits their interests.

<P>"China alone now buys one of every six of [Boeing's] planes," Sanger continued. And lofty rhetoric aside, Clinton's one achievement at the summit was to open the door to more exports to China, expected to be "the magic elixir that can cure many of the ills of the American economy" (Apple). Clinton arranged for sales of supercomputers and nuclear power generators; the manufacturers (Cray, GE) are also leading beneficiaries of the state-subsidized private profit system, and the items sold can be used for nuclear weapons and missiles, Pentagon officials and other experts observed. A problem, perhaps, because of a ban on such exports imposed last August "after American intelligence agencies produced conclusive proof" that China was engaged in missile proliferation, while also continuing "nuclear cooperation" with Iran, probably weapons production. But the problem was only superficial: Secretary of State Warren Christopher informed China that Washington would "interpret an American law governing the export of high technology to China to allow the export of two of the seven sophisticated American-made satellites banned by sanctions imposed on China in August, senior Administration officials said," adding that "there was no linkage" between the supercomputer and nuclear generator sales and the issue of proliferation.<FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2" HREF="#FN2"><SUP>2</SUP></A></FONT>

<P>These decisions illustrate the "very different notion of national security" to which Clinton "is drawn...with the Communist threat having receded," reported by Thomas Friedman in an adjacent column: "promoting free trade and stemming missile proliferation."

<P>There was also "no linkage" to human rights, another slight problem, if only because of Clinton's impassioned campaign rhetoric denouncing his predecessor for ignoring China's horrendous record in order to enhance corporate profits (called "jobs," in PC parlance). Just as Clinton's new export initiative was announced with much fanfare, a fire killed 81 workers in a factory with doors and windows locked "to keep people inside the factory during working hours," a spokesman said.<FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3" HREF="#FN3"><SUP>3</SUP></A></FONT> Appended to Friedman's lead story "Clinton Preaches Open Markets at Summit" the next day was a brief notice of "deadly accidents involving fire and poisonous gas" that had killed 100 workers "in booming Guandong Province," widely hailed as a free market model.

<P>Though there was "no linkage" to human rights issues or proliferation, it would be unfair to suggest that the New Democrats have no qualms about China's bad behavior. "Clinton administration officials are considering imposing trade sanctions against China," <CITE>The Wall Street Journal</CITE> reported a month later. The reason is China's "resolve to withstand U.S. pressure" to cut its textile exports. "Washington is angry over what it claims are more than $2 billion of Chinese-made textiles and apparel shipped illegally to the U.S. each year through third countries."<FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT4" HREF="#FN4"><SUP>4</SUP></A></FONT>

<P>December 31 was the deadline for Chinese submission to U.S.
protectionist demands, and also "for China to meet promises made to the U.S. in 1992 to open up its market." After China failed to live up to these paired obligations, "the Clinton administration is set to slash China's textile quotas by as much as a third while also lifting a ban on the sale of two communication satellites to Beijing," the <CITE>Journal</CITE> reports further, describing this as the "good-cop, bad-cop style": the "bad-cop" will punish China for its brazen defiance of U.S. barriers to free trade, and the "good-cop" will sell them satellites (despite the ban) to show that the U.S. is "ready to reward China if it makes demonstrable progress" -- also, incidentally, rewarding GM's Hughes Aircraft unit, which is looking forward to $1 billion in future business<FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT5" HREF="#FN5"><SUP>5</SUP></A></FONT>

<P>Careful students of free trade gospel will have no difficulty seeing how all this hangs together.

<P>The punishment was duly administered, Thomas Friedman reported in the lead story the next day. U.S. trade representative Mickey Kantor announced harsher quotas that should cost China over $1 billion, "to insure that China abides by its commitments to follow fair, nondiscriminatory trade practices" and to show the Administration's determination "to stand up for U.S. jobs" as demanded by the textile manufacturers' lobby, noted for its single-minded dedication to "jobs."<FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT6" HREF="#FN6"><SUP>6</SUP></A></FONT>

<P>Protectionist measures had been greatly enhanced under Reagan, who, in his impassioned pursuit of free trade, had "granted more import relief to U.S. industry than any of his predecessors in more than half a century," Secretary of Treasury James Baker proudly informed the business community. Not enough for the New Democrats, however. As Clintonites announced their National Export Strategy, which is to surpass the "less coordinated efforts" of Reagan and Bush to undermine free trade, including new GATT-violating measures, Secretary of Treasury Lloyd Bentsen explained: "I'm tired of a level playing field. We should tilt the playing field for U.S. businesses."<FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT7" HREF="#FN7"><SUP>7</SUP></A></FONT>

<P>The contours of the inspiring new gospel come into still sharper focus.

<P>Though market discipline is not for us, the lesser breeds are to adhere rigorously to its strictures. The promise and problems are illustrated by three December 22 stories.

<P>In the <CITE>Christian Science Monitor,</CITE> Sheila Tefft reported from Beijing under the heading "Growing Labor Unrest Roils Foreign Businesses in China." "Industrial tragedies and labor disputes are stirring tensions between Chinese workers and their foreign bosses," she reports, giving two examples: the November fire that killed 81 women trapped "behind barred windows and blocked doorways," and another a few weeks later that killed 60 workers in a Taiwanese-owned textile mill. More than 11,000 Chinese workers were killed in industrial accidents in the first eight months of 1993, double the 1992 rate, the Labor Ministry reported. "Chinese officials and analysts say the accidents stem from abysmal working conditions, which, combined with long hours, inadequate pay, and even physical beatings, are stirring unprecedented labor unrest among China's booming foreign joint ventures." "The tensions reveal the great gap between competitive foreign capitalists lured by cheap Chinese labor and workers weaned on socialist job security and the safety net of cradle-to-grave benefits." Their minds poisoned by socialist indoctrination, workers fail to comprehend that after their rescue by the Free World, they are to be "beaten for producing poor quality goods, fired for dozing on the job during long work hours" and other such misdeeds, and locked into their factories to be burned to death.

<P>In a <CITE>New York Times</CITE> report from Shanghai, Patrick Tyler ruminates on the problem from a different perspective. The city "is racing to recapture the glory of capitalism that flourished here 60 years ago" when it "reached the zenith of power and allure," before it "crumbled under the scorn and persecution of Communism." In those glory days, "expatriate merchants imported European architecture and society, living in mansions behind high walls in the concession areas they were granted" by China's rulers -- the "grants" assisted now and then by foreign guns. "The masses of Chinese outside these walls suffered the instability of warlord rule, gang rivalry and political struggle between the underground Communist movement and the corrupt Nationalist Government" -- though they remained untouched, it seems, by "Western imperialism" (cited in horror quotes, if at all). "Old Shanghai had opium dens, cabarets imitating Europe's best, pink gin, cigars," and for "the masses of Chinese," indescribable misery and torment. The city then sank into its "long decline" with Japan's conquest and the Communist takeover, which "drained the city of its foreign population and investment" and "deflated what capitalist spirit remained." While the spirit is now reviving, it is not certain that the grandeur of yore can be regained: "Whether Shanghai can rival its position of old is a much contested question," Tyler observes.

<P>Progress in that direction is reported by Joseph Kahn in the <CITE>Wall Street Journal.</CITE> He describes government projects to "usher out hundreds of thousands" of people from Shanghai to "satellite cities created by diktat to make way for office buildings, hotels and luxury apartments," so that Shanghai will "become a city for the rich and the powerful people," an expelled shopkeeper complains. The representative for a foreign developer disagrees: "The people are very happy to move out," he says, much like those who enjoy "urban renewal" in advanced capitalist countries. Shanghai may never quite recapture the "glory of capitalism," but perhaps it can at least come to look more like New York and Chicago.

<P>There are additional signs of progress on that front. "Murder, robbery and other violent crimes are sharply on the rise in China," the official press reported, up 17.5% in 1993.<FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT8" HREF="#FN8"><SUP>8</SUP></A></FONT>

<P>Russia has moved more rapidly towards the "glory of capitalism." Under Western-prescribed "shock therapy," the population starves with "poverty now visible in Russia in ways that it never was before," while more Mercedes 600 SEL's are sold at $130,000 each than in New York, Celestine Bohlen reports. Purchasers are the new rich (many of them the old <I>Nomenklatura</I>), who are working for foreign companies or selling off Russia's resources. Others belong to the criminal syndicates springing up as "crime and business have become interwoven in Russia to an alarming degree." "Crime has risen dramatically...as the controls of the totalitarian state have fallen away and before the certainties of a law-abiding society have emerged to take their place," though "Moscow is still lagging behind American levels of murder and violence," with only about half the murder rate of New York, where capitalist democracy implanted "the certainties of a law-abiding society" long ago. "Russian society has begun to break down into social layers, with people at the top who are extraordinarily rich and people at the bottom who are poor," Bohlen adds; oddly, just the pattern that prevails where Western guidance has proceeded without interruption, and increasingly, in the rich industrial societies themselves.<FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT9" HREF="#FN9"><SUP>9</SUP></A></FONT>

<P>Could there be some lessons here?

<P>The great hope in the East is Poland, where the free fall of the economy since 1989 finally bottomed out. It resembles other Third World success stories, not only in the divide between great wealth and mass misery and in providing supercheap labor to allow Western investors to drive down wages and social services at home, but down to fine detail. Poland's foreign expert was Harvard's Jeffrey Sachs, now plying his wares in Russia. He earned his fame by helping to orchestrate an economic miracle in Bolivia, a macroeconomic success and human disaster; Bolivians suffer the social reality, the West applauds the statistics and the opportunities for enrichment, unconcerned that the statistical successes are based in large measure on sharply increased production of illegal drugs, which may have become the major export earner. Sachs then moved on to Poland, which now provides Western Europe with its highest-quality illegal drugs, including 20% of the amphetamines confiscated in 1991, up from 6% in the late 1980s. Poland may also be the biggest transshipment point for narcotics from Central America, Afghanistan, and the Southeast Asian golden triangle, though "drug trafficking has also increased sharply throughout the region," Raymond Bonner reports. Costa Rica's Ambassador to Poland was arrested at the Warsaw airport with almost $1 million worth of pure heroin, and "a staggering 1.2 tons of cocaine was seized in St. Petersburg," from Colombia, where cartels are hiring Polish couriers to smuggle cocaine to the West. The former Soviet regions of Central Asia are expected to become major drug producers down the road.<FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT10" HREF="#FN10"><SUP>10</SUP></A></FONT>

<P>This standard pattern under Western tutelage, perhaps the most persuasive example of maximization of utility and efficient use of resources under free market conditions, should gain more respect than it does.

<P>Meanwhile market discipline retains its traditional dual aspect: rigid for the victims, quite different for the victors. GM purchased an auto plant near Warsaw, but "on the under-the-table condition that the Polish government provide it with 30 percent tariff protection," Alice Amsden observes. Similarly, "VW is capitalizing on low labor costs" to build cars in the Czech Republic for export to the West, but "the tortuous journey towards free markets" includes "a very attractive deal" in which VW was able to reap the profits and "to leave the Government with the debts and with enduring problems like how to clean up pollution," while "stiff tariffs" guarantee the profits of the foreign investors. Daimler-Benz recently worked out a similar "attractive deal" with Alabama, on the Third World model, <CITE>The Wall Street Journal</CITE> noted.<FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT11" HREF="#FN11"><SUP>11</SUP></A></FONT>

<P>The former Soviet domains still fall short of Western standards for Third World dependencies, however. Some of the distance yet to be travelled was revealed in a Canadian Broadcasting Company investigation, <CITE>The Body Parts Business,</CITE> "a gruesome litany of depredation," reporting murder of children and the poor to extract organs, "eyeballs being removed from living skulls by medical pirates armed only with coffee spoons," and other such entrepreneurial achievements.<FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT12" HREF="#FN12"><SUP>12</SUP></A></FONT> Such practices, long reported in Latin America and perhaps now spreading to Russia, have recently been acknowledged by one of the most prized U.S. creations, the government of El Salvador, where the procurator for the defense of children reported that the "big trade in children in El Salvador" involves not only kidnapping for export, but also their use "for pornographic videos, for organ transplants, for adoption and for prostitution."<FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT13" HREF="#FN13"><SUP>13</SUP></A></FONT>

<P>The dead hand of socialist values is impeding progress beyond countries like China that are now reforming. At the Pan-American games in Puerto Rico, extraordinary efforts were made to lure Cuban athletes, but though "ardently courted," almost all "spurned the pleas to jump ship" despite "the desperate Cuban economy and the potential for million-dollar major-league contracts."<FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT14" HREF="#FN14"><SUP>14</SUP></A></FONT> Under the heading "Defects in the System?," referring to the fact that some Cubans did succumb to the courting, Steve Fainaru reports in more detail on the ardent efforts and their general failure. Boxer Felix Savon was offered a $20 million contract, but refused, saying that "money is not the essential thing for a human being." "Savon is crazy," one of the defectors said: "He's been reading too much Communist propaganda." The most painful tragedy was the failure of any baseball players to defect, though scouts from every major league team were dangling huge contracts in front of their eyes. "There's so much wasted talent over there," a scout for the Dodgers complained: "It really makes me mad when I think about how these guys could be making millions" instead of returning to the country that they say they love: "But there's nothing we can do. [Castro] is the one who has the last word," his mystic presence forcing the athletes to return to the "economic despair" at home.<FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT15" HREF="#FN15"><SUP>15</SUP></A></FONT>

<P>Applebome reviews the "struggle for daily survival in Cuba" while maintaining a stony silence on the U.S. role, the norm for respectable commentary. Thus, reviewing a book on Castro, Mark Uhlig scornfully derides the "failing regime" of the "the Ego That Devoured Cuba," the villain who "has no one else to blame for its deepening crisis," surely not terror and economic warfare from Washington and Miami, which merit not a word in this typical display of moral cowardice.<FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT16" HREF="#FN16"><SUP>16</SUP></A></FONT> Fainaru departed from good taste, at least mentioning the embargo.

<P>The "deepening crisis" for which Castro bears sole responsibility is driving many women to prostitution, as in the days before the capitalist spirit was deflated. But whether Havana "can rival its position of old" under the "glory of capitalism" is also "a much contested question," now that women have been "schooled in that socialist certainty that she must bow to no one."<FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT17" HREF="#FN17"><SUP>17</SUP></A></FONT> As the gospel reaches Cuba, that malady too may pass.

<P>For a deeper understanding of the gospel we should lift our eyes to the higher reaches of thought. Some help is offered in an address to a January 1993 conference of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences by the distinguished philosopher, anthropologist, and historian Ernest Gellner.<FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT18" HREF="#FN18"><SUP>18</SUP></A></FONT> He explains that "humankind in general is dominated by three types of motivations: honor, interest, and salvation." Honor was displaced by interest after the scientific revolution and economic growth under capitalism; perhaps that explains the "craziness" of backward Cubans, still in the primitive grip of honor. The third option is "salvationism" -- in its modern form, "secular salvationism (read: Marxism)": "the idea of running an industrial society through the establishment of righteousness on earth," the goal to which Stalin dedicated his every waking moment. That option was repudiated in 1989, signalling the end of Marxism, which inevitably leads to totalitarianism, just as "modern industrial totalitarianism must be Marxist." What remains is "a kind of International of Consumerist Unbelievers," who understand that public policies to change the near-perfect social arrangements geared to private profit and accumulation would lead straight to the Gulag.

<P>At last all is clear.

<P><H1>Israel, Lebanon, and the "Peace Process"</H1>

<P>Noam Chomsky

<P>April 23, 1996
</CENTER>

<P>
Lebanon has been a victim of the Arab-Israel conflict for half
a century. In 1948, and again in 1967, it was a dumping ground
for Palestinians who fled or were expelled by the Israeli army.
 Their right to return or compensation is written into the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights (Dec. 10, 1948), spelled out more
explicitly in UN Resolution 194 passed unanimously the next day,
and reiterated annually.
<P>
That right, of course, is conditional on U.S. decisions. Since
World War II, the U.S. has controlled the region, recognizing
it to be "a stupendous source of strategic power, and one
of the greatest material prizes in world history." Washington's
support of the right of return was rhetorical only, and has been
officially abandoned by the Clinton Administration. By U.S. decision,
then, the refugees are a problem for Lebanon and Jordan, and do
not have the rights accorded them by the community of nations.
<P>
After the 1967 Israel-Arab war, a diplomatic framework was established
calling for peace along with Israeli withdrawal from the occupied
territories, with at most minor and mutual adjustment (UN 242,
reiterated in official U.S. policy statements). The Arab states
refused peace and Israel refused withdrawal, proposing instead
the "Allon Plan," which left it in control of much of
the territories. The impasse was broken in 1971, when President
Sadat of Egypt agreed to full peace in return for Israeli withdrawal
from Egyptian territory. U.S. policy then shifted to support
for Israel's stand, under Kissinger's formula of "stalemate."
<P>
International isolation increased in the mid-1970s, when virtually
the entire world endorsed a modification of UN 242 to include
a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza. Washington was
compelled to veto a Security Council resolution to this effect
in January 1976, to vote regularly against subsequent UN resolutions,
and to block other diplomatic initiatives from Europe, the Arab
states, the PLO, and others.
<P>
From the early 1970s, Lebanon was drawn into the conflict as a
result of cross-border PLO terror and far more destructive Israeli
attacks on Lebanon, sometimes retaliatory, often not. Thus in
February 1973, Israeli forces attacked north of Beirut, killing
many civilians, in a raid justified as preemptive. In December
1975, Israeli bombing killed over 50 Lebanese in an attack Israel
described as "preventive, not punitive"; it appears
to have been a reaction to the UN Security Council meeting debating
the diplomatic settlement that Israel opposed and Washington vetoed.
There are many other examples.
<P>
The Camp David agreements in 1978-79 neutralized Egypt, leaving
Israel "free to sustain military operations against the PLO
in Lebanon as well as settlement activity on the West Bank"
(Israeli strategic analyst Avner Yaniv). As Yaniv and other Israeli
commentators have observed, Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon,
after a year of Israeli attacks that failed to elicit PLO retaliation,
was motivated by concern that the PLO's public advocacy of the
international consensus might undermine U.S.-Israeli rejectionism.
 The invasion eliminated the problem of PLO moderation by demolishing
the organization in Lebanon, but created a new problem: the formation
of the Islamic fundamentalist group Hizbollah, with the official
aim of driving Israel from Lebanon. Despite massive resort to
terror, Israel was forced to withdraw from all but the southern
part of Lebanon, where it maintains a "security zone"
in violation of orders of the UN Security Council issued in March
1978.
<P>
The Iraq war in 1991 put the U.S. in a position to implement its
own unilateral settlement, ratified in the Oslo Agreements. The
latest phase, Oslo II, grants Israel control of far more of the
territories than it demanded in the Allon Plan, and affirms its
legal rights throughout the territories, thus rescinding UN 242
and other relevant UN Resolutions and official declarations. 
A greatly expanded Jerusalem region is effectively incorporated
within Israel, which also keeps control of most of West Bank water
resources. Settlement and construction programs implementing these
plans were extended, relying on U.S. subsidies. During the first
three years of the Rabin-Peres Labor government, to July 1995,
the number of settlers increased by 30% (not counting Greater
Jerusalem). Government expenditures and inducements for new settlers
continue after Oslo II. The intended goal, it appears, is to
ensure Israel's control of the territories, with scattered cantons
of local Palestinian administration. If these are called a "Palestinian
state," the result will resemble South Africa's Bantustan
policy, but not quite. The Bantustans were subsidized by South
Africa, while the U.S.-Israeli plan is to leave to the Palestinian
cantons the task of dealing with the bitter effects of the military
occupation, which barred any possibility of economic development.
<P>
Meanwhile Israeli attacks on Lebanon continued, killing many civilians. 
In 1993, these attacks elicited retaliation by Hizbollah, to
which Israel responded by invading Lebanon. An agreement was
reached to restrict military actions by either side to Israel's
"security zone" in Lebanon. Israel has ignored the
agreement, attacking elsewhere at will. Thus, the day that Prime
Minister Shimon Peres took office after the Rabin assassination
in November 1995, the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> reported approvingly
that Israeli warplanes attacked targets near Beirut, thus demonstrating
that Peres would maintain Rabin's hard line. So matters continued,
occasionally receiving brief notice, as on March 21 1996, when
Israel attacked Muslim villages north of the "security zone"
in retaliation for attacks on its occupying army. The standard
story in U.S. commentary is that "the accord had largely
held until [April 1996], when Hezbollah resumed its attacks"
(<CITE>New York Times</CITE>). The slightest attention to facts suffices
to refute the doctrine, which nevertheless reigns unchallenged.
<P>
The Israeli offensive of April 1996, much like those of earlier
years, has the openly expressed intent of punishing the civilian
population so that the government of Lebanon will be compelled
to accept U.S. - Israeli demands. It is this "rational prospect"
that has always motivated Israel's attacks on civilian populations,
Israeli diplomat Abba Eban explained years ago.
<P>
The short-term goal today, Washington announced, is to modify
the 1993 agreement to require that all actions against the Israeli
occupying forces cease, and that Hizbollah disarm; Lebanon rejected
the proposal, insisting on the right of resistance to foreign
occupation that was endorsed by the UN in 1987 by a vote of 153-2
(U.S. and Israel opposed, Honduras alone abstaining), still unreported
in the U.S. Washington's long-term goal is to integrate Lebanon
and Syria into the Middle East system based on U.S. client states.
Palestinians in the occupied territories are to be reduced to
a minor annoyance, with local administration under general Israeli
control. The refugees are to be forgotten.
<P>
It is well to remember that Israel's actions, however one assesses
them, are conducted with virtual impunity. As Washington's leading
client state, Israel inherits the right to do as it chooses. 
A dramatic illustration of this right, quite relevant to Lebanon,
has just been offered in the home country. On April 19, there
was much anguished commentary on the car bombing at Oklahoma City
a year earlier, when middle America "looked like Beirut,"
headlines lamented.
<P>
Beirut, of course, had looked like Beirut long before; for example,
just 10 years before, when the worst terrorist act of the period
was perpetrated in Beirut, a car bombing timed to cause maximum
civilian casualties, virtually duplicated at Oklahoma City. The
facts are well known, but unmentionable. That act of terror was
carried out by the CIA, a fact that suffices to remove the incident
from history along with much else that suffers the same defect.
 The implications are of no slight significance in world affairs.

<HEAD><TITLE>Colombia: The Culture of Fear</TITLE>

<H1>The Culture of Fear</H1>

<P>Noam Chomsky



<P><P><TABLE WIDTH=66%><TR><TD ALIGN=center>

<I>This essay is the introduction to </I>Colombia: The Genocidal Democracy,<I> a 125-page book by

Javier Giraldo S.J., written in 1996.</I>

</TABLE>

</CENTER>



<P></P>

<P>Two facts should be uppermost in the minds of North American readers of Father Giraldo's

documentation of the reign of terror that engulfed Colombia during the "Dirty War" waged by the

state security forces and their paramilitary associates from the early 1980s. The first is that

Colombia's "democra-tatorship," as Eduardo Galeano termed this amalgam of democratic forms and

totalitarian terror, has managed to compile the worst human rights record in the hemisphere in

recent years, no small achievement when one considers the competition. The second is that Colombia

has had accessories in crime, primary among them the government of the United States, though

Britain, Israel, Germany, and others have also helped to train and arm the assassins and torturers

of the narco-military-landowner network that maintains "stability" in a country that is rich in

promise, and a nightmare for many of its people.</P>



<P>In July 1989, the U.S. State Department announced plans for subsidized sales of military

equipment to Colombia, allegedly "for antinarcotics purposes." The sales were "justified" by the

fact that "Colombia has a democratic form of government and does not exhibit a consistent pattern

of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights."</P>



<P> A few months before, the Commission of Justice and Peace that Father Giraldo heads had

published a report documenting atrocities in the first part of 1988, including over 3,000

politically-motivated killings, 273 in "social cleansing" campaigns. Political killings averaged

eight a day, with seven people murdered in their homes or in the street and one "disappeared."</P>



<P>Citing this report, the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA) added that "the vast majority

of those who have disappeared in recent years are grass-roots organizers, peasant or union leaders,

leftist politicians, human rights workers and other activists," over 1500 by the time of the State

Department's praise for Colombia's democracy and its respect for human rights. During the 1988

electoral campaigns, 19 of 87 mayoral candidates of the sole independent political party, the UP,

were assassinated, along with over 100 of its other candidates. The Central Organization of

Workers, a coalition of trade unions formed in 1986, had by then lost over 230 members, most of

them found dead after brutal torture.</P>



<P>But the "democratic form of government" emerged without stain, and with no "consistent pattern

of gross violations" of human rights.</P>



<P>By the time of the State Department's report, the practices it found praiseworthy were being

more efficiently implemented. Political killings in 1988 and 1989 rose to 11 a day, the Colombian

branch of the Andean Commission of Jurists reported. From 1988 through early 1992, 9,500 people

were assassinated for political reasons along with 830 disappearances and 313 massacres (between

1988 and 1990) of peasants and poor people.</P>



<P>Throughout these years, as usual, the primary victims of state terror were peasants. In 1988,

grassroots organizations in one southern department reported a "campaign of total annihilation and

scorched earth, Vietnam-style," conducted by the military forces "in a most criminal manner, with

assassinations of men, women, elderly and children. Homes and crops are burned, obligating the

peasants to leave their lands." Also in 1988 the government of Colombia established a new judicial

regime that called for "total war against the internal enemy." It authorized "maximal

criminalization of the political and social opposition," a European-Latin American Inquiry reported

in Brussels, reviewing "the consolidation of state terror in Colombia."</P>



<P>As the State Department report appeared a year after these events, the Colombian Minister of

Defense again articulated the doctrine of "total war" by state power "in the political, economic,

and social arenas." Guerrillas were the official targets, but as a high military official had

observed in 1987, their organizations were of minor importance: "the real danger," he explained, is

"what the insurgents have called the political and psychological war," the efforts "to control the

popular elements" and "to manipulate the masses." The "subversives" hope to influence unions,

universities, media, and so on, and the government must counter this "war" with its own "total war

in the political, economic, and social arenas."</P>



<P>Reviewing doctrine and practice, the Brussels study concludes realistically that the "internal

enemy" of the state terrorist apparatus extends to "labor organizations, popular movements,

indigenous organizations, oppositional political parties, peasant movements, intellectual sectors,

religious currents, youth and student groups, neighborhood organizations," indeed any group that

must be secured against undesirable influences. "Every individual who in one or another manner

supports the goals of the enemy must be considered a traitor and treated in that manner," a

Colombian military manual prescribes.</P>



<P>The manual dates from 1963. At that time, violence in Colombia was coming to be "exacerbated by

external factors," the president of the Colombian Permanent Committee for Human Rights, former

Minister of Foreign Affairs Alfredo Vasquez Carrizosa, wrote some years later, reviewing the

outcome. "During the Kennedy administration," he continues, Washington "took great pains to

transform our regular armies into counterinsurgency brigades, accepting the new strategy of the

death squads."</P>



<P>These initiatives "ushered in what is known in Latin America as the National Security Doctrine,

. . . not defense against an external enemy, but a way to make the military establishment the

masters of the game . . . [with] the right to combat the internal enemy, as set forth in the

Brazilian doctrine, and the Colombian doctrine: it is the right to fight and to exterminate social

workers, trade unionists, men and women who are not supportive of the establishment, and who are

assumed to be communist extremists."</P>



<P>The "Dirty War" escalated in the early 1980s -- not only in Colombia -- as the Reagan

administration extended these programs throughout the region, leaving it devastated, strewn with

hundreds of thousands of corpses tortured and mutilated people who might otherwise have been

insufficiently supportive of the establishment, perhaps even influenced by "subversives."</P>



<P>North Americans should never allow themselves to forget the origins of "the Brazilian doctrine,

the Argentine doctrine, the Uruguayan doctrine, the Colombian doctrine," and others like them. They

were crafted right, then adapted by students trained and equipped right here. The basic guidelines

are spelled out in U.S. manuals of counterinsurgency and "low intensity conflict."</P>



<P>These are euphemisms, technical terms for state terror, a fact well known in Latin America. When

Archbishop Oscar Romero wrote to President Carter in 1980 shortly before his assassination, vainly

pleading with him to end U.S. support for the state terrorist, he informed the rector of the Jesuit

University, Father Ellacuria, that he was prompted "by the new concept of special warfare, which

consists in murderously eliminating every endeavor of the popular organizations under the

allegation of Communism or terrorism . . ." So Father Ellacuria reported shortly before he was

assassinated by the same hands a decade later; the events framed the murderous decade with the

symbolism as gruesome as it was appropriate.</P>



<P>The agents of state terror are the beneficiaries of U.S. training designed to ensure that they

have an "understanding of, and orientation toward, U.S. objectives," Defense Secretary Robert

McNamera informed National Security Adviser McGeorge Bundy in 1965. This is a matter of particular

importance "in the Latin American cultural environment," where it is recognized that the military

must be prepared to "remove government leaders from office, whenever, in the judgment of the

military, the conduct of these leaders is injurious to the welfare of the nation." It is the right

of the military and those who provide them with the proper orientation who are entitled to

determine the welfare of the nation, not the beasts of burden toiling and suffering and expiring in

their own lands.</P>



<P>When the State Department announced new arms shipments as a reward for Colombia's achievements

in human rights and democracy, it surely had access to the record of atrocities that had been

compiled by the leading international and Colombian human rights organizations. It was fully aware

of the U.S. role in establishing and maintaining the regime of terror and oppression. The example

is, unfortunately, typical of a pattern that hardly varies, as can be readily verified.</P>



<P>As the "Dirty War" of the 1980s took its ever more grisly toll, U.S. participation increased.

From 1984 through 1992, 6,844 Colombian soldiers were trained under the U.S. international Military

Education and Training Program. Over 2,000 Colombian officers were trained from 1990 to 1992, as

"violence reached unprecedented levels" during the presidency of Cesar Gaviria, WOLA reported,

confirming conclusions of international human rights monitors.</P>



<P>President Gaviria was a particular favorite of Washington, so admired that the Clinton

administration imposed him as Secretary-General of the Organization of American States in a power

play that aroused much resentment. "He has been very forward looking in building democratic

institutions in a country where it was sometimes dangerous to do so," the U.S. representative to

the OAS explained -- not inquiring into the reasons for the "dangers," however. The training

program for Colombian officers is the largest in the hemisphere, and U.S. military aid to Colombia

now amounts to about half the total for the entire hemisphere. It has increased under Clinton,

Human Rights Watch reports, adding that he planned to turn emergency overdrawing facilities when

the Pentagon did not suffice for still further increases.</P>



<P>The official cover story for the participation in crime is the war "against the guerrillas and

narcotrafficking operations." In its 1989 announcement of new arms sales, the State Department

could rely on its human right reports, which attributed virtually all violence to the guerrillas

and narcotraffickers. Hence the U.S. is "justified" in providing military equipment and training

for the mass murderers and torturers.</P>



<P>A month later, George Bush announced the largest shipment of arms ever authorized under the

emergency provisions of the Foreign Assistance Act. The arms were not sent to the National Police,

which is responsible for almost all counter-narcotic operations, but to the army. The helicopters

and jet planes are useless for the drug war, as was pointed out at once, but not for other

purposes. Human rights groups soon reported the bombing of villages and other atrocities. It is

also impossible to imagine that Washington is not aware that the security forces it is maintaining

are closely linked to the narcotrafficking operations, and that exactly as their leaders frankly

say, the target is the "internal enemy" that might support or be influenced by "subversives" in

some way.</P>



<P>A January 1994 conference on state terror organized by Jesuits in San Salvador observed that "it

is important to explore . . . what weight the culture of terror has had in domesticating the

expectations of the majority vis-a-vis alternatives different to those of the powerful." That is

the crucial point, wherever such methods are used to subdue the "internal enemy."</P>



<P>Israeli physician Ruchama Marton, who has been at the forefront of investigation of the use of

torture by the security forces of her own country, points out that while confessions obtained by

torture are of course meaningless, the real purpose is not confession. Rather, it is silence,

"silence induced by fear." "Fear is contagious," she continues, "and spreads to the other members

of the oppressed group, to silence and paralyze them. To impose silence through violence is

torture's real purpose, in the most profound an fundamental sense." The same is true of all other

aspects of the doctrines that have been devised and implemented with our guidance and support under

a series of fraudulent guides.</P>



<P>To impose silence on the internal enemy is necessary in the "democra-tatorships" that U.S.

policy has sought to impose on its domains ever since it "assumed, out of self-interest,

responsibility for the welfare of the world capitalist system," in the words of diplomatic Gerald

Haines, senior historian of the CIA, discussing the U.S. takeover of Brazil in 1945---and indeed

before, with important echoes at home as well. It is particularly important to impose silence in

the region with the highest inequality in the world, thanks in no small measure to policies of the

superpower that largely controls it.</P>



<P>It is necessary to impose silence and spread fear in countries like Colombia, where the top

three percent of the landed elite own over 70% of arable land while 57% of the poorest farmers

subsist on under 3% -- a country where 40% of the population live in "absolute poverty," unable to

satisfy basic subsistence needs according to an official government report in 1986, and 18% live in

"absolute misery," unable to meet nutritional needs. The Colombian Institute of Family Welfare

estimates that four and a half million children under 14 are hungry, half the country's

children.</P>



<P>Recall that we are speaking of a country of enormous resources and potential. It has "one of the

healthiest and most flourishing economies in Latin America," Latin Americanist John Martz writes in

Current History, lauding this triumph of capitalism in a society with "democratic structures"

which, "notwithstanding inevitable flaws, are among the most solid on the continent," a model of

"well-established political stability" -- conclusions that are not inaccurate, if not quite in the

sense he seeks to convey</P>



<P>The effects of U.S. arms and military training are not confined to Colombia. The record of

horrors is all too full. In the Jesuit journal <I>America</I>, Rev. Daniel Santiago, a priest

working in El Salvador, reported in 1990 the story of a peasant woman who returned home one day to

find her mother, sister, and three children sitting around a table, the decapitated head of each

person placed on the table in front of the body, the hands arranged on top "as if each body was

stroking its own head." The assassins, from the Salvadoran National Guard, had found it hard to

keep the head of an 18-month-old baby in place, so they nailed the hands to it. A large plastic

bowl filled with blood stood in the center of the table.</P>



<P>Two years earlier, the Salvadoran human rights group that continued to function despite the

assassination of its founders and directors reported that 13 bodies had been found in the preceding

two weeks, most showing signs of torture, including two women who had been hanged from a tree by

their hair, their breasts cut off and their faces painted red. The discoveries were familiar, but

the timing is significant, just as Washington was successfully completing the cynical exercise of

exempting its murderous clients from the terms of the Central America peace accords that called for

"justice, freedom and democracy," "respect for human rights," and guarantees for "the endless

inviolability of all forms of life and liberty." The record is endless, and endlessly shocking.</P>



<P>Such macabre scenes, which rarely reached the mainstream in the United States, are designed for

intimidation. Father Santiago writes that "People are not just killed by death squads in El

Salvador -- they are decapitated and then their heads are placed on pikes and used to dot the

landscape. Men are not just disemboweled by Salvadoran Treasury Police; their severed genitalia are

stuffed in their mouths. Salvadoran women are not just raped by the national guard; their wombs are

cut from their bodies and used to cover their faces. It is not enough to kill children; they are

dragged over barbed wire until the flesh falls from their bones while parents are forced to watch."

"The aesthetics of terror in El Salvador is religious." The intention is to ensure that the

individual is totally subordinated to the interests of the Fatherland, which is why death squads

are sometimes called the "Army of National Salvation" by the governing ARENA party.</P>



<P>The same is true in neighboring Guatemala. In the traditional "culture of fear," Latin American

scholar Piero Gleijeses writes, peace and order were guaranteed by ferocious repression, and its

contemporary counterpart follows the same course: "Just as the Indian was branded a savage beast to

justify his exploitation, so those who have sought social guerrillas, or terrorists, or drug

dealers, or whatever the current term of art may be." The fundamental reason, however, is always

the same: the savage beast may fall under the influence of "subversives" who challenge the regime

of injustice, oppression and terror that must continue to serve the interests of foreign investors

and domestic privilege.</P>



<P>Throughout these grim years, nothing has been more inspiring than the courage and dedication of

those who have sought to expose and overcome the culture of fear in their suffering countries. They

have left martyrs, whose voices have been silenced by the powerful -- yet another crime.</P>



<P>But they continue to struggle on. Father Giraldo's remarkable work and eloquent words should not

only inspire us, but also impel us to act to bring these terrors to an end, as we can. His

testimony here contains an "urgent appeal." It should be answered, but it does not go far enough.

Our responsibilities extend well beyond. The fate of Colombians and many others hinges on our

willingness and ability to recognize and meet them.</P>

</TABLE>
</CENTER> 

<P>
Two facts about Colombia are crucial to bear in mind. The first
is that Colombia has a horrendous human rights record, the worst
in the hemisphere - not an easy prize to win. Political killings
are variously estimated at 5 to 10 a day, mostly by the state
security forces or their paramilitary associates. The second fact
is that Colombia receives about half of U.S. military aid for
the hemisphere, increasing under President Clinton, who turned
to emergency overdrawing facilities when the Pentagon budget did
not allow the increase.
<P>
State terror in Colombia has been appalling through the '80s,
becoming even worse under the most recent ex-president, Cesar
Gaviria. He has been a special favorite of the United States,
so admired that the Clinton Administration rammed him through
as Secretary General of the OAS, in a power play that was much
resented in the hemisphere. Washington praised him particularly
for his steps towards "building democratic institutions in
a country where it was sometimes dangerous to do so."
<P>
That it is dangerous to enter the public arena in Colombia is
not in doubt. Thousands of members of the one real opposition
party - the two that share political power have been aptly designated
by a former President as "two horses [with] the same owner"
- could easily testify to the dangers, had they not been murdered,
including presidential candidates, mayors, and many activists.
President Gaviria helped substantially to maintain and expand
these dangers.
<P>
No patterns are broken by the fact that the hemisphere's leading
human rights violator is the prime recipient of military aid and
other support, or that the fact passes without notice. That's
par for the course. An important study of the topic was published
in 1981 by the leading academic specialist on human rights in
Latin America, Lars Schoultz. He investigated U.S. foreign aid
and torture in Latin America, and found that they correlated closely.
As he put it, U.S. aid "has tended to flow disproportionately
to Latin American governments which torture their citizens, .
. . to the hemisphere's relatively egregious violators of fundamental
human rights." This continued right through the Carter years,
including military aid uncorrelated with need.
<P>
These facts might lead a superficial observer to conclude that
the U.S. government just likes torture. But causal connection
can't be deduced from a correlation; we have to look further.
This was done in a broader study carried out at the same time
by an economist at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania,
Edward Herman, published in a book we co-authored in 1979. Herman
studied the relation between torture and foreign aid worldwide,
finding that the same correlation held: states that engage in
torture are more likely to receive U.S. aid. But Herman also did
a second study which offers a plausible explanation for the correlation.
He compared U.S. aid with the climate for business operations,
finding that the two were closely correlated. That makes sense.
Foreign aid, after all, is largely a device whereby the U.S. taxpayer
subsidizes U.S. corporations via some other country, which may
incidentally gain from the process. Resorting to this device increasingly
as opportunities for profit improve is completely natural, given
the sources of policy-making.
<P>
Why then should there be a correlation between U.S. aid and torture?
That becomes clear when we ask how the climate for business operations
is improved. The answer is straightforward and well known: by
torturing union leaders and human rights activists, murdering
priests who are trying to organize peasants, and so on. Putting
all this together, we find a derivative correlation between U.S.
aid and torture. The proper conclusion then, is not that U.S.
leaders enjoy torture; rather, it is a matter of indifference.
What they care about is profits for U.S. investors, which just
happen to be correlated with torture. Hence torture is rewarded,
indirectly. The phenomenon is global, and understandable.
<P>
The case of Colombia sharpens the conclusion. A fine way to maintain
a favorable investment climate is to create a society with formal
democracy, but equipped with devices to ensure that it doesn't
function to impede what really matters: enriching the wealthy.
Under those conditions aid can flow freely and profits are not
reduced by such interferences with the market as unions and human
rights. The Latin American Bureau in Britain once described Colombia
as a "democracy without people," which is pretty much
accurate. Such a "democra-tatorship," to borrow the
term coined by Eduardo Galeano for Colombia, will naturally resort
to torture, killing, "social cleansing," and other such
procedures, so as to maintain an economic system in which half
the children are hungry while the few live in luxury, along with
foreign investors. That is what security forces are for. And it
is the prime reason for military aid from the great power that
has "assumed, out of self-interest, responsibility for the
welfare of the world capitalist system," in the words of
diplomatic historian Gerald Haines, senior historian of the CIA,
discussing the U.S. takeover of Brazil in 1945.
<P>
The application of the general principles of world order to Colombia
was explained lucidly by the president of the Colombian Permanent
Committee on Human Rights, Alfredo Vasquez Carrizosa. He observed
that Colombia has been progressing towards democracy not only
since President Gaviria took over but since 1886, when its Constitution
granted a wide range of rights, also instituting a state of siege
that has persisted with little change so that "behind the
facade of a constitutional regime we have a militarized society,"
with immense suffering and injustice.
<P>
It's not that Colombia is an impoverished society. It has enormous
material resources, and might have undergone significant industrialization
if the ruling business classes had not been so committed to free
market policies. One of the small secrets about economic development,
well known to economic historians, is that such policies impede
development. Part of the reason why today's First and Third Worlds
have diverged so radically since the 18th century is that the
First World followed policies of protectionism and other state
intervention, the U.S. often leading the way, while the Third
World was subjected to market discipline, which was rammed down
their throats. What possibilities there might have been for an
industrial revolution in Colombia were aborted by its adherence
to the rules taught by the IMF, the World Bank, and much of the
academic profession.
<P>
The result is that Colombia is a rich country, but a very poor
one for most of the population. Land is a big problem, not because
it is in short supply, but because it's owned by a tiny number
of people. Land reform legislation has been on the books since
1961, but it isn't implemented. The reason is that the country
is run by the landowners and the army, which works for them and
which is paid for by U.S. taxpayers. The current system was pretty
well established by the Kennedy Administration, which in 1962
made a decision of immense significance for the hemisphere it
controlled. It changed the mission of the Latin American military
from hemispheric defense, a residue of World War II, to "internal
security" - a code word that means: war against the population.
The shift was implemented in planning, training, and material.
It set off a plague of repression throughout the hemisphere beyond
anything in its very bloody history. Some years later, the official
in charge of counterinsurgency for the Kennedy and the early Johnson
Administrations, Charles Maechling, described what happened clearly
enough: the 1962 decision led to a change from toleration "of
the rapacity and cruelty of the Latin American military"
to "direct complicity" in "the methods of Heinrich
Himmler's extermination squads."
<P>
The latter reference is appropriate. In his book Instruments of
Statecraft, Michael McClintock describes how after World War II,
Nazi specialists in counterinsurgency were brought to the United
States to help develop the postwar manuals for training in counterinsurgency,
modeled on the methods used by the Nazis to suppress the resistance.
Maechling's reference to the neo-Nazi states, established throughout
the hemisphere with the support of the Kennedy Administration
and its successors, is more than metaphor.
<P>
The Kennedy intellectuals grasped the issues in their own ways.
In internal communications in 1965, Defense Secretary Robert McNamara
pointed out to National Security Advisor McGeorge Bundy that U.S.
military training had provided Latin American officers with "the
understanding of, and orientation toward, U.S. objectives."
That is important, he explained, because "in the Latin American
cultural environment" it is recognized that the military
must be prepared "to remove government leaders from office,
whenever, in the judgment of the military, the conduct of these
leaders is injurious to the welfare of the nation." He didn't
say which nation he had in mind, but since they have the proper
"understanding of and orientation toward U.S. objectives,"
I guess it really doesn't matter.
<P>
McNamara was doubtless thinking of the event described by Kennedy's
Ambassador Lincoln Gordon as "the single most decisive victory
of freedom in the mid-twentieth century," "a great victory
for the free world" which should "create a greatly improved
climate for private investment." Gordon was referring to
the military coup in Brazil which overthrew the parliamentary
regime and instituted the first of the neo-Nazi national security
states of Latin America, with a domino effect that led to similar
victories for "freedom" over much of the hemisphere.
<P>
Displaying their understanding of and orientation toward U.S.
objectives, the Brazilian generals instituted an impressive wave
of torture, murder, and other state terror. By these means, they
created an "economic miracle." Brazil became "the
Latin American darling of the business community," the business
press exulted. Foreign investors did very nicely, as did a small
sector of Brazilian society, some living in extraordinary luxury
while much of the population was sinking to the conditions of
Central Africa. That's virtually the definition of the technical
term "economic miracle," as you discover if you look
around the world, including Mexico, lauded as "an economic
miracle" until December 19, 1994, when the bubble burst and
the U.S. taxpayer was called on, as usual, to protect the rich
from market discipline.
<P>
The effects of the new policy guidelines extended to Colombia.
In the 1960s, Vasquez Carrizosa continues, violence was "exacerbated
by external factors" as the Kennedy Administration "took
great pains to transform [Latin American] regular armies into
counterinsurgency brigades, accepting the new strategy of the
death squads," and thus "ushered in what is known in
Latin America as the National Security Doctrine, . . . not defense
against an external enemy, but a way to make the military establishment
the masters of the game . . . [with] the right to combat the internal
enemy, as set forth in the Brazilian doctrine, the Argentine doctrine,
the Uruguayan doctrine, and the Colombian doctrine: it is the
right to fight and to exterminate social workers, trade unionists,
men and women who are not supportive of the establishment, and
who are assumed to be communist extremists." The military
is able to carry out these tasks once they have gained a proper
"understanding of and orientation towards" U.S. objectives,
thanks to the training paid for by U.S. tax dollars along with
the arms to do the job.
<P>
The Colombian Minister of Defense explained that the official
apparatus of terror is designed for "total war in the political,
economic, and social arenas." Officially the targets are
guerrilla organizations. But as a high military official explained
in 1987, these are of minor importance: "the real danger"
is "what the insurgents have called the political and psychological
war," the war "to control the popular elements"
and "to manipulate the masses." The "subversives"
hope to influence unions, universities, media, and so on. Therefore,
"every individual who in one or another manner supports the
goals of the enemy must be considered a traitor and treated in
that manner." The last is a quote from a 1963 military manual
provided under the guidance of the Kennedy instructors and the
Nazi advisors.
<P>
As I write this, the current edition of <TT>The New York Times</TT>
[13 march 1995] provides a rare window on the official doctrine,
referring to Argentina in the late 1970s. It reports the remorse
of a naval officer over his participation in torture, drugging,
and throwing people out of airplanes - the "Argentine doctrine"
that proceeded with U.S. support, which is placed in the shadow
in today's news item.
<P>
Perhaps in 20 years we'll learn something about the "Colombian
Doctrine" that is being implemented today. We can learn something
right now if we like, even from official sources, which recently
provided a unique window into how they operate: the report of
a commission set up by the Colombian Government to investigate
the Trujillo massacre of March 1990. It gives a graphic account
of the "Colombian Doctrine," which is to say, U.S. doctrine.
This 186-page report documents one atrocity, which by miraculous
accident was investigated. The commission included members of
the Colombian government, army, and police. It was established
under pressure from the OAS (Organization of American States)
and others. Its account is very much like what everyone can read
in shocking detail in the regular reports of Amnesty International,
Human Rights Watch/Americas, and other inquiries that are constantly
appearing but almost never reported.
<P>
After entering the region where the village is located, the Armed
Forces and National Police compelled someone to state under torture
that he had been associated with the guerrillas and to provide
names. Then, the report says, "the horror began." People
were "dragged out of their homes, tied up and taken to the
luxurious hacienda" of a "well-known drug trafficker"
and "shut into a fertilizer shed." Just after 7AM, the
officer in charge, Major Urue&ntilde;a, arrived with an associate.
"First, they had breakfast. Then, the Major and several members
of the armed group went into the shed and demanded each person's
identification papers and belongings." The people were then
taken blindfolded, one by one, for interrogation, beginning with
a 59-year-old woman. "A coffee sack was tied over the head
of each victim and he was thrown onto the ground. Then Major Urue&ntilde;a
took a water hose, turned it full force on the face of each victim
- the mouth and nose - and began to interrogate them. When he
finished, the victims were piled one on top of the other, and
someone called for the blowtorch and the chain saw. Each victim
was decapitated, cut into pieces with the chain saw and left to
bleed. The heads and torsos were put into different sacks, and,
later that night, loaded into a blue 1956 Ford truck, driven down
to the Cauca river, and dumped into the water."
<P>
A month later, the headless body of Trujillo's parish priest was
"fished out of the river," the 27th victim. By then,
one of the participants, a civilian auxiliary to Major Urue&ntilde;a,
had fled and reported what had happened to the Colombian judicial
authorities. He was later "disappeared," and has not
been heard from since. The authorities dismissed his charges,
acquitting everyone implicated. The atrocities continued.
<P>
The story was reported by the Jesuit-based human rights group
Justice and Peace (Justicia y Paz). Its director, Father Javier
Giraldo, was able to interest the Human Rights Commission of the
OAS, leading finally to this report. It concludes that the Colombian
Army and police officers were directly responsible for the massacre
and that the government and justice system were to blame for covering
it up, specifically implicating Major Urue&ntilde;a. The Commission
recommended criminal investigations, but expressed its "pessimism"
that the pattern of impunity can be breached, and records the
strong opposition of the Colombian government members to the "exploration"
of international legal mechanisms, consistent with the norms of
the "democra-tatorship" that is successfully "building
democratic institutions in a country where it was sometimes dangerous
to do so."
<P>
Justice and Peace reports over 350 other massacres since Trujillo,
none of them investigated. This one exception, they point out,
"gives insight into the moral fiber of former Colombian President
Cesar Gaviria - now Secretary General of the O.A.S, who for four
years turned a deaf ear" to requests for investigation of
the massacre carried out during his term in office. And also into
"the values and principles" of the army - but more important
for us in the U.S., the values and principles of those who train
and arm and instruct the army, along with others that follow similar
doctrines.
<P>
To his credit, the new President, Ernesto Samper, on receiving
the report accepted Colombian government responsibility - a historic
first, I think. Urue&ntilde;a, who had been rewarded by promotion
to Colonel, was removed from active service; that's his punishment.
The army "rallied around the Colonel," Justice and Peace
reports, and its commander dismissed the Commission's findings
as "a farce." The report was presented to the OAS on
February 7th with an agreement that in six months, Colombia must
respond. The Justice and Peace report ends by saying: "The
country is waiting." How long it waits depends in large measure
on what we do in the United States.
<P>
That's the one case that the government officially concedes. Years
after the events, the governments of Brazil and Argentina are
conceding some of what happened after the historic 1962 change
- not Chile, where the army is still granted impunity and substantial
control. It's good to learn how U.S. tax money is spent in the
"Latin American cultural environment." Possibly some
day there'll be questions raised here about the "North American
cultural environment," but we'll wait a long time for that
unless we do something about it, while plenty of people continue
to suffer.
<P>
Atrocities in the region reached their peak during the Reagan
years. That's why the studies I mentioned about torture and aid
have not been duplicated since 1980. No one bothers to prove that
2 and 2 is 4. And it's still going on, the worst human rights
violator in the hemisphere being rewarded by the largest grant
of U.S. military aid.
<P>
The 1980s saw "the consolidation of state terror in Colombia,"
a European- Latin American inquiry into State Terror concludes.
Training of Colombian officers increased along with terror. In
the 1980s Colombia benefited from the largest U.S. training program,
with three times as many officers trained as El Salvador - which
wasn't too pretty either. They have also had Israeli, German,
and British instructors, who train not only the army but also
assassins and paramilitary forces linked to the drug cartels.
Colombian intelligence (DAS) reports further that "North
American instructors" - that means U.S. instructors - have
been "detected" at these training camps. This 1988 report
has yet to be published here in the mainstream, as far as I know,
and if it's been followed up, I haven't heard about it.
<P>
I won't say any more about the hideous record of state terror,
easily accessible to anyone interested. The pretext for U.S. support
for these atrocities is the drug war, which became a national
obsession when it was launched by George Bush in September 1989;
re-launched, one should say, since this is a regular event. A
month before, the largest shipment of arms ever authorized under
the emergency provisions of the Foreign Assistance Act was sent
to the Colombian army, setting the stage, William Hartung reports,
"for sending more U.S. weaponry to Colombia than it had received
in the entire decade of the 1980s," which was plenty. They
were sent to the army - helicopters, planes, and so on, useless
for the drug war, as was pointed out at the time. About 90-95%
of counter-narcotic operations are conducted by the National Police,
but not with bombers and helicopters. These have other uses. Human
rights groups soon reported bombings of villages, massacres, and
other atrocities. The effects of the arms shipments might well
have been to strengthen the links between the security forces
and narcotraffickers, and the land owning classes associated with
them.
<P>
Colombia gets arms from other countries too, though in part that
is a cover for U.S. arms shipments. Israel, in particular, is
one of the funnels through which the United States sends arms
to favored clients. Recall that the U.S. alone provides half of
all its military aid in Latin America to Colombia. When we add
the indirect aid it provides through its clients, and the contributions
of other members of Washington's international terror network
(including Britain, Germany, Taiwan, Israel, and so on), the aid
to Colombia is quite substantial. There's a lot of talk right
now about the Omnibus Anti-Terrorism Bill, with an odd omission:
the center of international terrorism, where the bill is being
debated.
<P>
Apart from its role in maintaining the "democra-tatorship"
and favorable investment climate, sale of arms to Colombia serves
other needs. One of the leading monitors of international arms
sales, William Hartung, points out in a recent book that the addiction
to arms sales to the Third World is considerably more serious
than drug addiction. The U.S. now has close to three-quarters
of this market, making the term "addiction" more than
appropriate. This is one of the ways to keep the Pentagon at approximately
Cold War levels. True, the "Soviet threat" has substantially
reduced, but without lessening the threat to our security, which
the government now sees in "the technological sophistication
of Third-World powers." For that threat to justify a big
Pentagon budget, we have to make sure to send advanced armaments
to the Third World. Otherwise, where will they obtain the technological
sophistication that we have to find ways to protect ourselves
from?
<P>
This is all explicit and frank in military journals and business
propaganda. Thus you can read in <TT>Jane's Defense Weekly</TT>,
the major international military journal, that U.S. tax dollars
are now going to pay Lockheed-Martin to upgrade F-16s for sale
to Third World countries with loans from the Export-Import Bank,
a further gift from U.S. taxpayers. And plainly taxpayers now
have to fund the corporation to produce F-22 advanced fighters
to defend us from the upgraded F-16s that we're sending to potential
enemies. The corporate headquarters happens to be in Cobb County
Georgia, represented in Congress by a gentleman named Newt Gingrich,
who has been able to bring home more federal subsidies than any
suburban county in the country outside of Arlington Virginia (part
of the federal government) and the Florida home of the Kennedy
Space Center (another part).
<P>
The arms sale addiction is only a small piece of a much larger
one, on which the economy heavily depends. Military spending has
generally long served as a cover for distributing public funds
to advanced industry, military or not. Sale of arms to Colombia
helps marginally here too - another factor that contributes to
the correlation between military aid and torture.
<P>
Let's turn finally to the drug war, the pretext for all of this.
Colombia became a major producer of cocaine in the late 1970s.
Why? In fact, why do peasants in Latin America even bother to
produce coca, apart from their own use, as they've done forever?
The reasons are rooted in the social and economic policies imposed
on the Third World. The rules dictate that they have to stop producing
for their own needs, and turn export. And unlike the rich Western
countries, they have to open their markets, specifically, to subsidized
U.S. agricultural exports, which undermine domestic production.
The local farmers are to become "rational producers"
in accord with the precepts of modern economics, producing crops
for export. And being rational, as they are, they turn to the
crops that make the most money. Accordingly, coca production has
just shot out of sight, helping to undergird "economic miracles."
Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard, who has more recently been plying his
trade in Poland and Russia, won his fame by setting things in
order in Bolivia in 1985. Bolivia was in real trouble, but he
instructed them in the proper free-market theory, and pretty soon
all was fine, with good macro-economic statistics, and so on.
There were also some side effects. One was that the "miracle"
was relying very heavily on coca exports. Much the same is true
in Peru.
<P>
Similar reasons lie behind Colombia's turn towards narcotrafficking.
There were others as well. In 1988, the U.S. compelled coffee
producers to break an agreement that had kept prices at some reasonable
level. The price of coffee, Colombia's main export crop, fell
40%. When coffee prices collapse and half the children are already
starving, people are likely to turn to where there are opportunities,
thanks to the North American drug market. One major impetus for
the huge increase in the flow of drugs is the free-market policies
imposed on the Third World.
<P>
A second reason, somewhat narrower, has to do with U.S. drug policies.
Their design has driven people from relatively harmless marijuana
to hard drugs like cocaine, in ever more lethal form. Colombia
shifted from producing marijuana to far more profitable and easily
transportable cocaine.
<P>
Another question that arises about the drug traffic has to do
with its scale. A recent study by the OECD - the organization
of the rich countries - estimates profits from the international
drug traffic at almost half a trillion dollars a year, of which
over half circulates through the U.S. financial system. That suggests
a way to deal with the drug problem: look at the place that is
handling more than half the profits, U.S. financial institutions.
What about Colombia? According to the OECD report, it receives
about six billion dollars, which is 2 to 3% of what remains in
the United States. "The big business is therefore in that
country," the United States. I'm quoting from a review of
the study by a member of the Andean Commission of Jurists and
the Latin American Association of Human Rights, published by the
leading newspaper in Mexico, Excelsior, which published the report
of the OECD study that tells us where the drug business is really
going on.
<P>
What about the banks that are handling over 56% of the immense
profits generated by narcotrafficking, according to the OECD?
That's presumably illegal. In 1979 the government launched Operation
Greenback, targeting banks that were handling drug money, which
is apparently not too difficult to monitor. Huge sums of money
were suddenly coming into Miami banks just as the cocaine racket
was picking up steam, so the Justice Department went into action.
But not for long. The operation was called off in 1982 by the
drug czar of the Reagan Administration, vice-President George
Bush. We therefore lack any further information about the estimated
$260 billion a year of drug money that flows through the U.S.
financial system.
<P>
Other places are easier to investigate, like Panama. Recall that
right after the drug war was announced again with huge fanfare
by then-President Bush, the U.S. invaded Panama to protect us
from the evil Hispanic narcotraffickers led by the arch-fiend
Noriega. The invasion placed back in power the European elite
of bankers and narcotraffickers. The new Attorney General and
Treasury Minister, for example, had been directors of the First
Inter-Americas Bank, which had been closed by Noriega because
it was implicated in drug trafficking. President Endara, installed
by the U.S. Army, along with his law firm, were also involved
in the racket, it was reported. Since the invasion, Panama has
grown as a narcotrafficking center, with perhaps twice as many
narcotics flowing through as before.
<P>
One part of the drug racket is banking; another is the chemical
industry. In 1989, in the six months preceding the announcement
of the drug war the Colombian police found 1.5 million gallons
of chemicals used for cocaine production, many of them with U.S.
corporate logos on them. The CIA had reported that U.S. exports
of such chemicals to Latin America far exceed any legal uses,
while the Congressional Research Service concluded that more than
90% of the chemicals used for drug production come from the United
States. So that suggests another way to deal with the narcotrafficking
problem, if the war against drugs is a war against drugs, not
something else.
<P>
Any discussion of substance abuse is seriously distorted if it
avoids the leading killer, tobacco. The former head of the U.S.
Office of Drug Abuse Policy, Dr. Peter Bourne, pointed out that
the number of Colombians who die every year from substances produced
in the United States far exceeds the number of North Americans
who die from cocaine. The same is true here. Furthermore, unlike
tobacco, cocaine is not subsidized by the U.S. government, except
for the support we provide to the military who are involved in
the racket, and isn't publicly advertised. There's no cocaine
counterpart to the Marlboro Man. And Colombia does not strong-arm
the U.S. into permitting aggressive advertising and distribution
of cocaine, imitating Washington's behavior in Asia in support
of its favored lethal substance. That is a major story in itself,
which adds needed perspective to the narcotrafficking discussion,
but I won't go into it here.
<P>
What about President Gaviria, Washington's good friend? Under
his rule, the human rights record got even worse, but he did destroy
one of the two big cartels, the Medellin cartel - handing its
business over to its main competitor, the Cali cartel. The same
Justice and Peace group published a report on this recently. According
to their account, the two cartels were different in nature. The
Medellin Cartel had lower class origins. Pablo Escobar, who ran
it, was from the slums, and many of those involved were peasants
or lower middle class, or workers who'd entered the rackets. And
apparently the Medellin Cartel, though very brutal, had a populist
character, like some city bosses and mafia elements. They had
gained popular support by building sports fields, helping poor
people in need, and so on. The Cali cartel, in contrast, is strictly
business, like the banks and chemical corporations. With the elimination
of its Medellin rival, it now controls most of the drug trade
in Colombia, according to the report.
<P>
The U.S. has tried to help now and then. In the 1980s, when the
cocaine traffic was building up, the government of Colombia approached
the United States for assistance in building a radar station to
detect low-flying planes coming in from the main coca producing
regions. The Reagan Administration was very enthusiastic about
this idea, and did in fact construct a radar station for Colombia.
The station was built on San Andres Island, which is as far as
you can get on Colombian territory from the routes of the drug
planes, but is off the coast of Nicaragua and therefore could
be used to assist in Washington's terrorist war against Nicaragua.
<P>
In the same years, Costa Rica approached Washington with a similar
request, and again help was offered. Costa Rica, however, turned
to British experts for advice and analysis, and was informed that
the station that the U.S. was planning to build would serve no
drug purpose, but would be useful for aerial surveillance of Nicaragua.
It could therefore help guide the U.S.-trained terrorists to attack
"soft targets" like health clinics and agricultural
cooperatives. Costa Rica didn't go along with the proposal, and
this story too fell through the cracks.
<P>
The drug war serves several purposes. In part, it is a cover for
counterinsurgency and sustaining the "democra-tatorship."
It also makes a small contribution to the arms production addiction.
And it provides valuable mechanisms for locking up the superfluous
population at home, an important matter as a major effort is underway
to turn the United States itself into a society with striking
Third World characteristics. Here, we don't (yet) carry out social
cleansing by the security forces, so other means are needed for
dealing with people lacking human rights because they do not contribute
to profit-making. Locking them up makes sense, also providing
a Keynesian stimulus to the economy. For that, the drug war is
ideal, and it is used substantially for that purpose.
<P>
A large part of the jail population is there for victimless crimes,
which are carefully crafted. Take cocaine. The drug of choice
in the ghettos is crack, and penalties for possession are very
harsh; the drug of choice in the rich white suburbs is powder,
with much lower penalties - typical class-based legislation.
<P>
All of this explains a good part of what the drug war is about,
and also why the U.S. prison rate is zooming beyond any developed
country, and expected to continue to rise.
<P>
The drug war is also useful for frightening the population. When
social policies are designed to harm the large majority, the intended
victims have to be kept from seeing what's happening to them.
There are a few classic methods. One is to get them to fear one
another. The drug war probably has that effect. It's hard to test
the impact on the general population, but it is easier to see
how it affects articulate intellectuals. For an example, a recent
issue of the Harvard Magazine, the journal that goes to alumni,
has a cover story on someone who has developed new leadership
techniques that are considered quite sensational. They're teaching
them in business schools, and so on. He gives examples of how
these techniques work, and how they can improve leadership. The
main example he gives is George Bush's announcement of the drug
war. Bush made a mistake, he says, not following these new methods.
He describes how Bush came into office at a time when great fear
and concern about drugs was spreading all over the country, so
he reacted by declaring the war on drugs and going after Noriega
to try to stop narcotrafficking. But it didn't work, because those
are not the right leadership techniques.
<P>
The only problem with this analysis of improper and proper leadership
is that concern about drugs was very low when Bush entered office,
and remained so until the drug war was announced. There was plenty
of concern about the budget, jobs, and other matters, but drugs
were very low on the list. When Bush announced the drug war and
the media went into operation with a really massive propaganda
offensive, the polls showed a dramatic change. Drugs became a
major concern as the result of highly effective propaganda, following
the leader. At least among intellectuals, the right message may
well have been established, one that's the opposite of the facts.
Not an untypical feature of the intellectual culture, I should
say.
<P>
One last comment: Colombia's tragedy, and that is what it is,
has indigenous roots. For us in the U.S., the external causes
are the ones of greatest importance, because these we can influence.
But the sources are internal as well. This century opened with
a civil war in Colombia in which perhaps a hundred thousand people
were killed. A populist leader was murdered in 1948, and shortly
after, power fell into the hands of the first formal fascist to
take power after the Second World War, a supporter of Franco,
who received U.S. backing. These events were followed by a huge
upsurge of violence in which hundreds of thousands of people were
killed. The U.S. role really begins in a major way with the Kennedy
Administration as part of its general plans for Latin America,
and has been highly significant since.
<P>
There also are complex links to our own society, which merit thought
as well. The basic point was made more clearly and effectively
than I can express it in a letter I received recently from a friend
who is a leading Colombian human rights activist, Cecilia Zarate-Laun.
I'll just quote from her letter, hoping that she won't mind; this
wasn't prepared for publication, just a casual letter.
<P>
She is discussing a meeting of the Women's International League
for Peace and Freedom, one of the few groups in the world that
actually does something for poor and suffering people. It has
an American branch, which just came out with a document called
"The Women's Peace and Justice Treaty of the Americas"
- an excellent statement, in my opinion, well worth reading and
implementing. I don't expect to see a front-page article about
it soon, but you can obtain it, and I'd advise doing so. She writes:
"I firmly believe that everything is interrelated, since
the real culprit is the economic system, and it is very important
that the American people start connecting issues abroad with their
own reality, starting with its foreign policy, since things do
not happen in a vacuum. I will use an example to make my point:
the drug issue. The children of poor women, who in Colombia have
no opportunities because the society has abandoned them, and are
forced to be hitmen or to work in the cocaine laboratories to
make cocaine, or that are recruited to be members of a death squad
team - they are in the same situation as the children of poor
women in the United States who are forced to sell cocaine on the
corners of the streets, or to be lookouts for the salesmen, and
so on, and for the same reasons. The only difference is that the
ones speak Spanish and the others speak English. The tragedy is
the same."
<P>
I think she's right, and the tragedy is being heightened in both
countries by deliberate and self-conscious social policy. Meanwhile
we in the United States watch, and so far do nothing. If that
is our choice, it's not hard to imagine the prospects.

<H1>Anarchism, Marxism and Hope for the Future</H1>

<P>First published in <CITE>Red & Black Revolution</CITE> No 2 1996
<BR>From the <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/2419/index.html">All about
Anarchism</A> page

<P><P><TABLE WIDTH=66%><TR><TD>
<I>Noam Chomsky is widely known for his critique of U.S foreign policy, and for his work as a
linguist. Less well known is his ongoing support for libertarian socialist objectives. In a
special interview done for Red and Black Revolution, Chomsky gives his views on anarchism and
marxism, and the prospects for socialism now. The interview was conducted in May 1995 by Kevin
Doyle.</I>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>

<P><B>RBR: </B>First off, Noam, for quite a time now you've been an advocate for the anarchist
idea. Many people are familiar with the introduction you wrote in 1970 to Daniel Guerin's
Anarchism, but more recently, for instance in the film Manufacturing Consent, you took the
opportunity to highlight again the potential of anarchism and the anarchist idea. What is it that
attracts you to anarchism?
<P>
<B>CHOMSKY: </B>I was attracted to anarchism as a young teenager, as soon as I began to think
about the world beyond a pretty narrow range, and haven't seen much reason to revise those early
attitudes since. I think it only makes sense to seek out and identify structures of authority,
hierarchy, and domination in every aspect of life, and to challenge them; unless a justification
for them can be given, they are illegitimate, and should be dismantled, to increase the scope of
human freedom. That includes political power, ownership and management, relations among men and
women, parents and children, our control over the fate of future generations (the basic moral
imperative behind the environmental movement, in my view), and much else. Naturally this means a
challenge to the huge institutions of coercion and control: the state, the unaccountable private
tyrannies that control most of the domestic and international economy, and so on. But not only
these. That is what I have always understood to be the essence of anarchism: the conviction that
the burden of proof has to be placed on authority, and that it should be dismantled if that burden
cannot be met. Sometimes the burden can be met. If I'm taking a walk with my grandchildren and
they dart out into a busy street, I will use not only authority but also physical coercion to stop
them. The act should be challenged, but I think it can readily meet the challenge. And there are
other cases; life is a complex affair, we understand very little about humans and society, and
grand pronouncements are generally more a source of harm than of benefit. But the perspective is a
valid one, I think, and can lead us quite a long way.
<P>
Beyond such generalities, we begin to look at cases, which is where the questions of human
interest and concern arise.
<P>
<B>RBR: </B>It's true to say that your ideas and critique are now more widely known than ever
before. It should also be said that your views are widely respected. How do you think your support
for anarchism is received in this context? In particular, I'm interested in the response you
receive from people who are getting interested in politics for the first time and who may,
perhaps, have come across your views. Are such people surprised by your support for anarchism? Are
they interested?
<P>
<B>CHOMSKY:</B> The general intellectual culture, as you know, associates 'anarchism' with chaos,
violence, bombs, disruption, and so on. So people are often surprised when I speak positively of
anarchism and identify myself with leading traditions within it. But my impression is that among
the general public, the basic ideas seem reasonable when the clouds are cleared away. Of course,
when we turn to specific matters -- say, the nature of families, or how an economy would work in a
society that is more free and just -- questions and controversy arise. But that is as it should
be. Physics can't really explain how water flows from the tap in your sink. When we turn to vastly
more complex questions of human significance, understanding is very thin, and there is plenty of
room for disagreement, experimentation, both intellectual and real-life exploration of
possibilities, to help us learn more.
<P>
<B>RBR:</B> Perhaps, more than any other idea, anarchism has suffered from the problem of
misrepresentation. Anarchism can mean many things to many people. Do you often find yourself
having to explain what it is that you mean by anarchism? Does the misrepresentation of anarchism
bother you?
<P>
<B>CHOMSKY: </B>All misrepresentation is a nuisance. Much of it can be traced back to structures
of power that have an interest in preventing understanding, for pretty obvious reasons. It's well
to recall David Hume's Principles of Government. He expressed surprise that people ever submitted
to their rulers. He concluded that since <I>Force is always on the side of the governed, the
governors have nothing to support them but opinion. 'Tis therefore, on opinion only that
government is founded; and this maxim extends to the most despotic and most military governments,
as well as to the most free and most popular.</I> Hume was very astute -- and incidentally, hardly
a libertarian by the standards of the day. He surely underestimates the efficacy of force, but his
observation seems to me basically correct, and important, particularly in the more free societies,
where the art of controlling opinion is therefore far more refined. Misrepresentation and other
forms of befuddlement are a natural concomitant.
<P>
So does misrepresentation bother me? Sure, but so does rotten weather. It will exist as long as
concentrations of power engender a kind of commissar class to defend them. Since they are usually
not very bright, or are bright enough to know that they'd better avoid the arena of fact and
argument, they'll turn to misrepresentation, vilification, and other devices that are available to
those who know that they'll be protected by the various means available to the powerful. We should
understand why all this occurs, and unravel it as best we can. That's part of the project of
liberation -- of ourselves and others, or more reasonably, of people working together to achieve
these aims.
<P>
Sounds simple-minded, and it is. But I have yet to find much commentary on human life and society
that is not simple-minded, when absurdity and self-serving posturing are cleared away.
<P>
<B>RBR:</B> How about in more established left-wing circles, where one might expect to find
greater familiarity with what anarchism actually stands for? Do you encounter any surprise here at
your views and support for anarchism?
<P>
<B>CHOMSKY:</B> If I understand what you mean by <I>established left-wing circles,</I> there is
not too much surprise about my views on anarchism, because very little is known about my views on
anything. These are not the circles I deal with. You'll rarely find a reference to anything I say
or write. That's not completely true of course. Thus in the US (but less commonly in the UK or
elsewhere), you'd find some familiarity with what I do in certain of the more critical and
independent sectors of what might be called <I>established left-wing circles,</I> and I have
personal friends and associates scattered here and there. But have a look at the books and
journals, and you'll see what I mean. I don't expect what I write and say to be any more welcome
in these circles than in the faculty club or editorial board room -- again, with exceptions.
<P>
The question arises only marginally, so much so that it's hard to answer.
<P>
<B>RBR:</B> A number of people have noted that you use the term 'libertarian socialist' in the
same context as you use the word 'anarchism'. Do you see these terms as essentially similar? Is
anarchism a type of socialism to you? The description has been used before that <I>anarchism is
equivalent to socialism with freedom</I>. Would you agree with this basic equation?
<P>
<B>CHOMSKY: </B>The introduction to Guerin's book that you mentioned opens with a quote from an
anarchist sympathiser a century ago, who says that <I>anarchism has a broad back,</I> and
<I>endures anything.</I> One major element has been what has traditionally been called
'libertarian socialism'. I've tried to explain there and elsewhere what I mean by that, stressing
that it's hardly original; I'm taking the ideas from leading figures in the anarchist movement
whom I quote, and who rather consistently describe themselves as socialists, while harshly
condemning the 'new class' of radical intellectuals who seek to attain state power in the course
of popular struggle and to become the vicious <I>Red bureaucracy</I> of which Bakunin warned;
what's often called 'socialism'. I rather agree with Rudolf Rocker's perception that these (quite
central) tendencies in anarchism draw from the best of Enlightenment and classical liberal
thought, well beyond what he described. In fact, as I've tried to show they contrast sharply with
Marxist-Leninist doctrine and practice, the 'libertarian' doctrines that are fashionable in the US
and UK particularly, and other contemporary ideologies, all of which seem to me to reduce to
advocacy of one or another form of illegitimate authority, quite often real tyranny.
<P>
<H3>The Spanish Revolution</H3>
<P>
<B>RBR:</B> In the past, when you have spoken about anarchism, you have often emphasised the
example of the Spanish Revolution. For you there would seem to be two aspects to this example. On
the one hand, the experience of the Spanish Revolution is, you say, a good example of 'anarchism
in action'. On the other, you have also stressed that the Spanish revolution is a good example of
what workers can achieve through their own efforts using participatory democracy. Are these two
aspects -- anarchism in action and participatory democracy -- one and the same thing for you? Is
anarchism a philosophy for people's power?
<P>
<B>CHOMSKY:</B> I'm reluctant to use fancy polysyllables like <I>philosophy</I> to refer to what
seems ordinary common sense. And I'm also uncomfortable with slogans. The achievements of Spanish
workers and peasants, before the revolution was crushed, were impressive in many ways. The term
'participatory democracy' is a more recent one, which developed in a different context, but there
surely are points of similarity. I'm sorry if this seems evasive. It is, but that's because I
don't think either the concept of anarchism or of participatory democracy is clear enough to be
able to answer the question whether they are the same.
<P>
<B>RBR:</B> One of the main achievements of the Spanish Revolution was the degree of grassroots
democracy established. In terms of people, it is estimated that over 3 million were involved.
Rural and urban production was managed by workers themselves. Is it a coincidence to your mind
that anarchists, known for their advocacy of individual freedom, succeeded in this area of
collective administration? 
<P>
<B>CHOMSKY:</B> No coincidence at all. The tendencies in anarchism that I've always found most
persuasive seek a highly organised society, integrating many different kinds of structures
(workplace, community, and manifold other forms of voluntary association), but controlled by
participants, not by those in a position to give orders (except, again, when authority can be
justified, as is sometimes the case, in specific contingencies).
<P>
<H3>Democracy</H3>
<P>
<B>RBR:</B> Anarchists often expend a great deal of effort at building up grassroots democracy.
Indeed they are often accused of <I>taking democracy to extremes</I>. Yet, despite this, many
anarchists would not readily identify democracy as a central component of anarchist philosophy.
Anarchists often describe their politics as being about 'socialism' or being about 'the
individual'- they are less likely to say that anarchism is about democracy. Would you agree that
democratic ideas are a central feature of anarchism? 
<P>
<B>CHOMSKY:</B> Criticism of 'democracy' among anarchists has often been criticism of
parliamentary democracy, as it has arisen within societies with deeply repressive features. Take
the US, which has been as free as any, since its origins. American democracy was founded on the
principle, stressed by James Madison in the Constitutional Convention in 1787, that the primary
function of government is <I>to protect the minority of the opulent from the majority.</I> Thus he
warned that in England, the only quasi-democratic model of the day, if the general population were
allowed a say in public affairs, they would implement agrarian reform or other atrocities, and
that the American system must be carefully crafted to avoid such crimes against <I>the rights of
property,</I> which must be defended (in fact, must prevail). Parliamentary democracy within this
framework does merit sharp criticism by genuine libertarians, and I've left out many other
features that are hardly subtle -- slavery, to mention just one, or the wage slavery that was
bitterly condemned by working people who had never heard of anarchism or communism right through
the 19th century, and beyond. 
<P>
<H3>Leninism</H3>
<P>
<B>RBR:</B> The importance of grassroots democracy to any meaningful change in society would seem
to be self evident. Yet the left has been ambiguous about this in the past. I'm speaking
generally, of social democracy, but also of Bolshevism -- traditions on the left that would seem
to have more in common with elitist thinking than with strict democratic practice. Lenin, to use a
well-known example, was sceptical that workers could develop anything more than <I>trade union
consciousness</I>- by which, I assume, he meant that workers could not see far beyond their
immediate predicament. Similarly, the Fabian socialist, Beatrice Webb, who was very influential in
the Labour Party in England, had the view that workers were only interested in <I>horse racing
odds</I>! Where does this elitism originate and what is it doing on the left?
<P>
<B>CHOMSKY: </B>I'm afraid it's hard for me to answer this. If the left is understood to include
'Bolshevism,' then I would flatly dissociate myself from the left. Lenin was one of the greatest
enemies of socialism, in my opinion, for reasons I've discussed. The idea that workers are only
interested in horse-racing is an absurdity that cannot withstand even a superficial look at labour
history or the lively and independent working class press that flourished in many places,
including the manufacturing towns of New England not many miles from where I'm writing -- not to
speak of the inspiring record of the courageous struggles of persecuted and oppressed people
throughout history, until this very moment. Take the most miserable corner of this hemisphere,
Haiti, regarded by the European conquerors as a paradise and the source of no small part of
Europe's wealth, now devastated, perhaps beyond recovery. In the past few years, under conditions
so miserable that few people in the rich countries can imagine them, peasants and slum-dwellers
constructed a popular democratic movement based on grassroots organisations that surpasses just
about anything I know of elsewhere; only deeply committed commissars could fail to collapse with
ridicule when they hear the solemn pronouncements of American intellectuals and political leaders
about how the US has to teach Haitians the lessons of democracy. Their achievements were so
substantial and frightening to the powerful that they had to be subjected to yet another dose of
vicious terror, with considerably more US support than is publicly acknowledged, and they still
have not surrendered. Are they interested only in horse-racing?
<P>
I'd suggest some lines I've occasionally quoted from Rousseau: <I>when I see multitudes of
entirely naked savages scorn European voluptuousness and endure hunger, fire, the sword, and death
to preserve only their independence, I feel that it does not behoove slaves to reason about
freedom.</I> 
<P>
<B>RBR:</B> Speaking generally again, your own work -- <A HREF="../dd/dd.html">Deterring
Democracy</A>, <A HREF="../ni/ni.html">Necessary Illusions</A>, etc. -- has dealt consistently
with the role and prevalence of elitist ideas in societies such as our own. You have argued that
within 'Western' (or parliamentary) democracy there is a deep antagonism to any real role or input
from the mass of people, lest it threaten the uneven distribution in wealth which favours the
rich. Your work is quite convincing here, but, this aside, some have been shocked by your
assertions. For instance, you compare the politics of President John F. Kennedy with Lenin, more
or less equating the two. This, I might add, has shocked supporters of both camps! Can you
elaborate a little on the validity of the comparison?
<P>
<B>CHOMSKY: </B>I haven't actually <I>equated</I> the doctrines of the liberal intellectuals of
the Kennedy administration with Leninists, but I have noted <A
HREF="../other/intellectuals-state.html">striking points of similarity</A> -- rather as predicted
by Bakunin a century earlier in his perceptive commentary on the <I>new class.</I> For example, I
quoted passages from McNamara on the need to enhance managerial control if we are to be truly
<I>free,</I> and about how the <I>undermanagement</I> that is <I>the real threat to democracy</I>
is an assault against reason itself. Change a few words in these passages, and we have standard
Leninist doctrine. I've argued that the roots are rather deep, in both cases. Without further
clarification about what people find <I>shocking,</I> I can't comment further. The comparisons are
specific, and I think both proper and properly qualified. If not, that's an error, and I'd be
interested to be enlightened about it. 
<P>
<H3>Marxism</H3>
<P>
<B>RBR:</B> Specifically, Leninism refers to a form of marxism that developed with V.I. Lenin. Are
you implicitly distinguishing the works of Marx from the particular criticism you have of Lenin
when you use the term 'Leninism'? Do you see a continuity between Marx's views and Lenin's later
practices?
<P>
<B>CHOMSKY:</B> Bakunin's warnings about the <I>Red bureaucracy</I> that would institute <I>the
worst of all despotic governments</I> were long before Lenin, and were directed against the
followers of Mr. Marx. There were, in fact, followers of many different kinds; Pannekoek,
Luxembourg, Mattick and others are very far from Lenin, and their views often converge with
elements of anarcho-syndicalism. Korsch and others wrote sympathetically of the anarchist
revolution in Spain, in fact. There are continuities from Marx to Lenin, but there are also
continuities to Marxists who were harshly critical of Lenin and Bolshevism. Teodor Shanin's work
in the past years on Marx's later attitudes towards peasant revolution is also relevant here. I'm
far from being a Marx scholar, and wouldn't venture any serious judgement on which of these
continuities reflects the 'real Marx,' if there even can be an answer to that question. 
<P>

<B>RBR:</B> Recently, we obtained a copy of your own <A
HREF="../other/notes-on-anarchism.html">Notes On Anarchism</A> (re-published last year by
Discussion Bulletin in the USA). In this you mention the views of the <I>early Marx</I>, in
particular his development of the idea of alienation under capitalism. Do you generally agree with
this division in Marx's life and work -- a young, more libertarian socialist but, in later years,
a firm authoritarian?
<P>
<B>CHOMSKY:</B> The early Marx draws extensively from the milieu in which he lived, and one finds
many similarities to the thinking that animated classical liberalism, aspects of the Enlightenment
and French and German Romanticism. Again, I'm not enough of a Marx scholar to pretend to an
authoritative judgement. My impression, for what it is worth, is that the early Marx was very much
a figure of the late Enlightenment, and the later Marx was a highly authoritarian activist, and a
critical analyst of capitalism, who had little to say about socialist alternatives. But those are
impressions. 
<P>
<B>RBR: </B>From my understanding, the core part of your overall view is informed by your concept
of human nature. In the past the idea of human nature was seen, perhaps, as something regressive,
even limiting. For instance, the unchanging aspect of human nature is often used as an argument
for why things can't be changed fundamentally in the direction of anarchism. You take a different
view? Why?
<P>
<B>CHOMSKY:</B> The core part of anyone's point of view is some concept of human nature, however
it may be remote from awareness or lack articulation. At least, that is true of people who
consider themselves moral agents, not monsters. Monsters aside, whether a person who advocates
reform or revolution, or stability or return to earlier stages, or simply cultivating one's own
garden, takes stand on the grounds that it is 'good for people.' But that judgement is based on
some conception of human nature, which a reasonable person will try to make as clear as possible,
if only so that it can be evaluated. So in this respect I'm no different from anyone else.
<P>
You're right that human nature has been seen as something 'regressive,' but that must be the
result of profound confusion. Is my granddaughter no different from a rock, a salamander, a
chicken, a monkey? A person who dismisses this absurdity as absurd recognises that there is a
distinctive human nature. We are left only with the question of what it is -- a highly nontrivial
and fascinating question, with enormous scientific interest and human significance. We know a fair
amount about certain aspects of it -- not those of major human significance. Beyond that, we are
left with our hopes and wishes, intuitions and speculations. 
<P>
There is nothing <I>regressive</I> about the fact that a human embryo is so constrained that it
does not grow wings, or that its visual system cannot function in the manner of an insect, or that
it lacks the homing instinct of pigeons. The same factors that constrain the organism's
development also enable it to attain a rich, complex, and highly articulated structure, similar in
fundamental ways to conspecifics, with rich and remarkable capacities. An organism that lacked
such determinative intrinsic structure, which of course radically limits the paths of development,
would be some kind of amoeboid creature, to be pitied (even if it could survive somehow). The
scope and limits of development are logically related.
<P>
Take language, one of the few distinctive human capacities about which much is known. We have very
strong reasons to believe that all possible human languages are very similar; a Martian scientist
observing humans might conclude that there is just a single language, with minor variants. The
reason is that the particular aspect of human nature that underlies the growth of language allows
very restricted options. Is this limiting? Of course. Is it liberating? Also of course. It is
these very restrictions that make it possible for a rich and intricate system of expression of
thought to develop in similar ways on the basis of very rudimentary, scattered, and varied
experience. 
<P>
What about the matter of biologically-determined human differences? That these exist is surely
true, and a cause for joy, not fear or regret. Life among clones would not be worth living, and a
sane person will only rejoice that others have abilities that they do not share. That should be
elementary. What is commonly believed about these matters is strange indeed, in my opinion.
<P>
Is human nature, whatever it is, conducive to the development of anarchist forms of life or a
barrier to them? We do not know enough to answer, one way or the other. These are matters for
experimentation and discovery, not empty pronouncements. 
<P>
<H3>The future</H3>
<P>
<B>RBR: </B>To begin finishing off, I'd like to ask you briefly about some current issues on the
left. I don't know if the situation is similar in the USA but here, with the fall of the Soviet
Union, a certain demoralisation has set in on the left. It isn't so much that people were dear
supporters of what existed in the Soviet Union, but rather it's a general feeling that with the
demise of the Soviet Union the idea of socialism has also been dragged down. Have you come across
this type of demoralisation? What's your response to it?
<P>
<B>CHOMSKY: </B>My response to the end of Soviet tyranny was similar to my reaction to the defeat
of Hitler and Mussolini. In all cases, it is a victory for the human spirit. It should have been
particularly welcome to socialists, since a great enemy of socialism had at last collapsed. Like
you, I was intrigued to see how people -- including people who had considered themselves
anti-Stalinist and anti-Leninist -- were demoralised by the collapse of the tyranny. What it
reveals is that they were more deeply committed to Leninism than they believed.
<P>
There are, however, other reasons to be concerned about the elimination of this brutal and
tyrannical system, which was as much <I>socialist</I> as it was <I>democratic</I> (recall that it
claimed to be both, and that the latter claim was ridiculed in the West, while the former was
eagerly accepted, as a weapon against socialism -- one of the many examples of the service of
Western intellectuals to power). One reason has to do with the nature of the Cold War. In my view,
it was in significant measure a special case of the 'North-South conflict,' to use the current
euphemism for Europe's conquest of much of the world. Eastern Europe had been the original 'third
world,' and the Cold War from 1917 had no slight resemblance to the reaction of attempts by other
parts of the third world to pursue an independent course, though in this case differences of scale
gave the conflict a life of its own. For this reason, it was only reasonable to expect the region
to return pretty much to its earlier status: parts of the West, like the Czech Republic or Western
Poland, could be expected to rejoin it, while others revert to the traditional service role, the
ex-Nomenklatura becoming the standard third world elite (with the approval of Western
state-corporate power, which generally prefers them to alternatives). That was not a pretty
prospect, and it has led to immense suffering.
<P>
Another reason for concern has to do with the matter of deterrence and non-alignment. Grotesque as
the Soviet empire was, its very existence offered a certain space for non-alignment, and for
perfectly cynical reasons, it sometimes provided assistance to victims of Western attack. Those
options are gone, and the South is suffering the consequences.
<P>
A third reason has to do with what the business press calls <I>the pampered Western workers</I>
with their <I>luxurious lifestyles.</I> With much of Eastern Europe returning to the fold, owners
and managers have powerful new weapons against the working classes and the poor at home. GM and VW
can not only transfer production to Mexico and Brazil (or at least threaten to, which often
amounts to the same thing), but also to Poland and Hungary, where they can find skilled and
trained workers at a fraction of the cost. They are gloating about it, understandably, given the
guiding values.
<P>
We can learn a lot about what the Cold War (or any other conflict) was about by looking at who is
cheering and who is unhappy after it ends. By that criterion, the victors in the Cold War include
Western elites and the ex-Nomenklatura, now rich beyond their wildest dreams, and the losers
include a substantial part of the population of the East along with working people and the poor in
the West, as well as popular sectors in the South that have sought an independent path.
<P>
Such ideas tend to arouse near hysteria among Western intellectuals, when they can even perceive
them, which is rare. That's easy to show. It's also understandable. The observations are correct,
and subversive of power and privilege; hence hysteria.
<P>
In general, the reactions of an honest person to the end of the Cold War will be more complex than
just pleasure over the collapse of a brutal tyranny, and prevailing reactions are suffused with
extreme hypocrisy, in my opinion. 
<P>
<H3>Capitalism</H3>
<P>
<B>RBR:</B> In many ways the left today finds itself back at its original starting point in the
last century. Like then, it now faces a form of capitalism that is in the ascendancy. There would
seem to be greater 'consensus' today, more than at any other time in history, that capitalism is
the only valid form of economic organisation possible, this despite the fact that wealth
inequality is widening. Against this backdrop, one could argue that the left is unsure of how to
go forward. How do you look at the current period? Is it a question of 'back to basics'? Should
the effort now be towards bringing out the libertarian tradition in socialism and towards
stressing democratic ideas?
<P>
<B>CHOMSKY:</B> This is mostly propaganda, in my opinion. What is called 'capitalism' is basically
a system of corporate mercantilism, with huge and largely unaccountable private tyrannies
exercising vast control over the economy, political systems, and social and cultural life,
operating in close co-operation with powerful states that intervene massively in the domestic
economy and international society. That is dramatically true of the United States, contrary to
much illusion. The rich and privileged are no more willing to face market discipline than they
have been in the past, though they consider it just fine for the general population. Merely to
cite a few illustrations, the Reagan administration, which revelled in free market rhetoric, also
boasted to the business community that it was the most protectionist in post-war US history --
actually more than all others combined. Newt Gingrich, who leads the current crusade, represents a
superrich district that receives more federal subsidies than any other suburban region in the
country, outside of the federal system itself. The 'conservatives' who are calling for an end to
school lunches for hungry children are also demanding an increase in the budget for the Pentagon,
which was established in the late 1940s in its current form because -- as the business press was
kind enough to tell us -- high tech industry cannot survive in a <I>pure, competitive,
unsubsidized, 'free enterprise' economy,</I> and the government must be its <I>saviour.</I>
Without the <I>saviour,</I> Gingrich's constituents would be poor working people (if they were
lucky). There would be no computers, electronics generally, aviation industry, metallurgy,
automation, etc., etc., right down the list. Anarchists, of all people, should not be taken in by
these traditional frauds.
<P>
More than ever, libertarian socialist ideas are relevant, and the population is very much open to
them. Despite a huge mass of corporate propaganda, outside of educated circles, people still
maintain pretty much their traditional attitudes. In the US, for example, more than 80% of the
population regard the economic system as <I>inherently unfair</I> and the political system as a
fraud, which serves the <I>special interests,</I> not <I>the people.</I> Overwhelming majorities
think working people have too little voice in public affairs (the same is true in England), that
the government has the responsibility of assisting people in need, that spending for education and
health should take precedence over budget-cutting and tax cuts, that the current Republican
proposals that are sailing through Congress benefit the rich and harm the general population, and
so on. Intellectuals may tell a different story, but it's not all that difficult to find out the
facts. 
<P>
<B>RBR:</B> To a point anarchist ideas have been vindicated by the collapse of the Soviet Union --
the predictions of Bakunin have proven to be correct. Do you think that anarchists should take
heart from this general development and from the perceptiveness of Bakunin's analysis? Should
anarchists look to the period ahead with greater confidence in their ideas and history?
<P>
<B>CHOMSKY: </B> I think -- at least hope -- that the answer is implicit in the above. I think the
current era has ominous portent, and signs of great hope. Which result ensues depends on what we
make of the opportunities. 
<P>
<B>RBR:</B> Lastly, Noam, a different sort of question. We have a pint of Guinness on order for
you here. When are you going to come and drink it?
<P>
<B>CHOMSKY:</B> Keep the Guinness ready. I hope it won't be too long. Less jocularly, I'd be there
tomorrow if we could. We (my wife came along with me, unusual for these constant trips) had a
marvellous time in Ireland, and would love to come back. Why don't we? Won't bore you with the
sordid details, but demands are extraordinary, and mounting -- a reflection of the conditions I've
been trying to describe.

<H1>End the Atrocity in East Timor</H1>

<P>Noam Chomsky<BR>
January 1995<BR>
Published in <CITE>The Guardian,</CITE> March 22, 1995

<P><TABLE WIDTH=66%><TR><TD>
<I>In January of 1995, Noam Chomsky paid a visit to Australia and gave a number of lectures. This is an abridged version of what he had to say about East Timor in one of his talks. 

<P>His comments have been published by <CITE>The Guardian</CITE> newspaper of the Socialist Party of Australia in its issue dated 22nd March, 1995. At the present time Indonesian Special Strategic Reserve paratroopers are in Australia, by invitation of the Australian government, to participate in military exercises with the Australian Army.</I>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>


<P>The relevant background begins at the end of World War II when the United States assumed, out of self-interest, responsibility for the welfare of the world capitalist system. They're not my words. I'm quoting the respected diplomatic historian Gerald Haines who was also the senior historian at the CIA.

<P>The responsibility for the welfare of the rich and the privileged was taken very seriously. US business and political leaders carried out sophisticated global planning in which Indonesia had, in fact, a key role. The main task was to reconstruct the rich societies, crucially those that were called the "natural leaders" or the "great workshops", namely Germany and Japan, which had just demonstrated their prowess and therefore had to be rebuilt, but now safely under US control.

<P>In that general context, South-East Asia took on major importance, in particular Indonesia, which was the richest prize.

<P>Indonesia was called "Japan's empire towards the South". Those words are George Kennan's. He's one of the leading architects of the post-war world, the Head of the State Department Policy Planning staff. 

<P>So Japan's empire towards the South had to be reconstructed. In other words, the US undertook to reconstruct Japan's colonial empire, to which, incidentally, the United States had no serious objection prior to the war, except that the US was not being given privileged entry into it, one of the facts which I'm sure will be highlighted with the commemoration of the end of the war in the next couple of months.

<P>In fact, every part of the world was assigned a specific role by the planners. Africa for example was to be "exploited" as Kennan put it. 

<P>Africa was to be exploited for the reconstruction of Europe, and the US took over the Western hemisphere for itself, unceremoniously kicking out France and Britain. 

<P>As for South East Asia, it was, as the then group of planners put it, to fulfill it's main function in providing resources and raw materials for Western Europe and Japan, to help in their reconstruction and for the United States as well.

<P>Timor, incidentally was mentioned in the early planning. [Former US President] Franklin Delano Roosevelt held at one point that Timor did deserve independence, but he thought they shouldn't be too impatient about it. He suggested they wait about a thousand years, expressing the usual contempt for the "power orders". 

<P>"A political victory for the PKI [Communist Party of Indonesia]", Kennan said in a secret discussion "would be an infection that could sweep over all South Asia"; meaning others might make the same effort to win a political victory.

<P>Specialists on Indonesia here considered the expectation of a political victory not unrealistic. [One specialist] Harold Crouch writes that "the PKI had won widespread support, not as a revolutionary party, but as an organisation defending the interests of the poor within the existing system." So you can see what problems they were posed with.

<P>Kennan's terminology, incidentally, about an infection sweeping over the region, that's pretty standard. For example, Henry Kissinger [former US Secretary of State] described democratic Chile as "a virus that might infect others". 

<P>For the public that's called the "domino theory".  There's a rational version of the domino theory, namely the virus of democracy and successful independent development could well spread, could have a demonstration effect, and that's dangerous. When there's a virus around you've got to destroy it. 

<P>You also have to inoculate others so that they don't get harmed and that happens typically. A good bit of world history, I should say, falls under this pattern.

<P>In mid-1958 the Dulles brothers -- one of them was Secretary of State, the other the head of the CIA -- in a private conversation were deploring what they called the "communist ability to get control of mass movements, something we have no capacity to duplicate". 

<P>"Unlike us they can appeal directly to the masses", President Eisenhower complained. 

<P>Then John Foster Dulles explained the reason for this unfair advantage that they had. He said: "the poor people are the ones they appeal to and have always wanted to plunder the rich. That's the great problem of history and somehow we find it hard to sell our values, namely that the rich should plunder the poor." 

<P>That's a kind of public relations problem that no one has yet quite figured out how to overcome. And because we can't overcome it we are forced to resort to our comparative advantage in violence and terror.

<P>By the early 1960s, US experts were urging their contacts in the Indonesian military to "strike and sweep their house clean". That's Gary Parker of the Rand Corporation Airforce Research Tank.

<P>However, the Indonesian allies [of the US]...understood Western values...thoroughly and they proceeded to cleanse their society with the 1965-66 massacres that took perhaps half a million lives and wiped out the PKI.

<P>The country was quickly turned into what was called "a paradise for investors". US investment shot up with other associates and the threat of political victory by a party representing the poor was put off for a long, long time.

<P>The Indonesian generals had eliminated the threat of democracy by a staggering mass slaughter that destroyed the political party that had gained popularity by defending the interests of the poor and they had also, by then, compiled one of the worst human rights records in the world, while offering enormous riches to Western investors. 

<P>There were of course more particular reasons for the West to lend its hand to the new atrocities as the Indonesians invaded East Timor. 

<P>There was indeed great concern at that time about the fate of the Portuguese empire. Coverage of East Timor was quite high in the United States. If you think of what East Timor is to the United States, it's a bit surprising, but coverage was quite high in 1974 and 1975, in the context of the concern over Portugal and the fate of its empire.

<P>It's well remembered that it was not only East Timor that was subjected to a devastating Western-backed assault. The exact same thing was true of Angola and Mozambique, starting at the same time.

<P>There were also strategic interests. Some of them had to do with the deep water passage for nuclear submarines. My own suspicion is that when the record is released -- if it ever is, and I wouldn't count on that -- but if it's ever released we may well find that one major factor was one that was indeed emphasised by Australian Ambassador to Jakarta, Richard Woolcott in August 1975, right before the invasion started, which Australia knew all about, as did everyone despite the pretences. 

<P>In August 1975, in a famous cable that was leaked, he [Woolcott] advised that Australia must go along with the impending invasion because Australia could make a better deal on the oil reserves in the Timor Gap with Indonesia than with Portugal or an independent East Timor. 

<P>And what's good for the energy companies is always the national interest. That's true virtually by definition.

<P>Australia's de jure recognition of the annexation was in that context, so it seems, simultaneous with the beginnings of the negotiations on the oil. 

<P>That treaty was actually signed in 1989. It really went into effect immediately after the Dili massacres when the Indonesian and Australian joint authority began signing exploration contracts with major oil companies to rob the oil of what the treaty calls "the Indonesian province of East Timor", which you will recall, does not deserve the inalienable right of self-determination, we are told, because it's not viable economically. 

<P>That's the message being told by the people who are robbing [East Timor's] rich resources.

<P>In his treatise on Australian foreign policy, Foreign Minister Evans offers the Timor Gap Treaty as an example of non-military solution to a problem -- a model for the world to follow. It's pretty impressive! Not many people could carry that off!

<P>This horror story can be brought to an end if Westerners can exhibit even a fraction of the integrity and the courage shown by the Indonesians who were protesting what their government is doing under conditions vastly more onerous than any of us face or can imagine. 

<P>And I do not even speak of the incredible courage of the Timorese which shames all of us, perhaps Australians in particular, because of the debt of blood which remains from World War II, which I'm sure you know.

<P>We are, I think, at an important turning point in this case. 

<P>With enough energy and commitment to change Western policies, which we should be doing, there is good reason, I think...that one of the world's major atrocity stories can be brought to an end: that the people of East Timor can enjoy their inalienable right of self-determination, perhaps in less than a thousand years.

<P><H1>Manufacturing Dissent:</H1>
<H2>Noam Chomsky on Journalism</H2>

<P>January 1995


<P><P><TABLE WIDTH=66%><TR><TD>
Noam Chomsky has described a world where an underlying consensus structures the news media to manage public opinion. However Chomsky says there is scope for individual journalists to resist these trends. Peter Cronau spoke with Chomsky during his recent visit to Australia.
</TABLE>
</CENTER>

<P>He has been described as "the world's greatest dissident" and "arguably the
most important intellectual alive today". Professor Noam Chomsky, the softly
spoken Professor of Linguistics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
in Boston USA, delivers an analysis of the media that makes many
uncomfortable.<p>
From his young days selling newspapers on his uncle's news-stand in New York,
Chomsky has now become reportedly the world's most quoted intellectual.<p>
As well as giving his scathing critique of Western foreign policy and media
performance, Chomsky is of course also famous for his (then) revolutionary
theories on the origins of language, that language is wired-in at birth.<p>
Australia's Foreign Minister, Senator Gareth Evans, who has come in for
stinging criticism from Chomsky for his obsequious attitude to Indonesia, is on
the record as saying he thinks Chomsky "should confine himself to linguistics".
<p>
Chomsky's move to `dissident voice' occurred in 1964 during the Vietnam War,
and since then he has written and spoken out about injustice and repression
around the world. His many books include The Washington Connection and Third
World Fascism, American Power and the New Mandarins, For Reasons of State,
Fateful Triangle: The US, Israel and Palestine, Towards a New Cold War, The
Culture of Terrorism, Manufacturing Consent, Deterring Democracy, and Year 501:
The Conquest Continues.<p>
In January, Chomsky made his first visit to Australia. In eight days he
addressed ten sell-out audiences on topics as varied as human rights and East
Timor, democracy and the New World Order, the Middle East, the intellectual
responsibility of writers, through to linguistics.<p>
Chomsky views the media as an ideological system serving the powerful elites in
society. He explains how governments get away with lying, how academics and
intellectuals manufacture consent to the actions of government, and how the
media confine debate to the conservative middle ground.<p>
Chomsky argues the Western media have neglected their questioning role, instead
repeatedly giving primary access to intellectuals who defend the role of
Western governments. He sees the media's role as producing consensus amongst
the public towards the ruling elites in government and business.<p>
"The [media's] current mission is to ensure that any thought of controlling
their destiny must be driven from the minds of the rascal multitude," he has
written in, Year 501: The Conquest Continues. And, in Deterring Democracy, he
writes: "The goal is to eliminate public meddling in policy formation".<p>
Probably Chomsky's most known book in this country is Manufacturing Consent:
the political economy of the mass media, which he wrote in 1988 with Edward
Herman, a professor of finance at the University of Pennsylvania.<p>
The Propaganda Model sketched out in this book describes the structures and
influences that Chomsky believes produce systematic propaganda in the media.<p>
"It traces the routes by which money and power are able to filter out the news
fit to print, marginalise dissent, and allow government and dominant private
interests to get their messages across to the public."<p>
The model puts forward five filters on our news:<p>
* The size, concentrated ownership, owner wealth and profit orientation of the
dominant media outlets;<p>
* Advertising as the primary source of income for most media;<p>
* The reliance of the media on information provided by government, business,
and `experts' funded and approved by these primary sources and agents of
power;<p>
* `Flak' - criticism by the powerful of negative media statements - used as a
means of disciplining the media;<p>
* Control mechanisms of `anticommunism', `muslim fundamentalism', and so on.<p>
Chomsky (and Herman) don't try to suggest some conspiracy theory at work in
setting the media agenda, but mainly a form of self-censorship at work. <p>
"Most biased choices in the media arise from the preselection of right-thinking
people, internalised preconceptions, and the adaptation of personnel to the
constraints of ownership, organisation, market, and political power," they
write in Manufacturing Consent.<p>
While the propaganda model describes a global system that results in the
ignoring or suppression of voices of dissent, Chomsky does not argue that it is
an all-encompassing theory. Reportage asked whether the model allows scope for
journalists wanting to remain independent and to avoid becoming a mouthpiece
for the ruling elites.<p>
"It's intended to pick out major factors that frame the way an institution
functions," says Chomsky. "Now as any scientist knows you start a rational
inquiry by trying to identify the major factors and then there's a whole set of
secondary and tertiary factors that interfere. If you really look down into the
details you'll find all sorts of other things going on. I'll mention one which
is known to any serious investigative journalist, and a lot of them use it. <p>
"There are periodic scandals - meaning some horrible thing that happened by
accident escapes, that's called a scandal - and the media feeders have to
pretend to be very irate: how can our democracy survive etcetera etcetera. <p>
"It is well known among serious journalists that after a major scandal, like
say Watergate or Iran-Contra or something, there is a period of a couple of
months when the media tend to be more open. And then you can sneak in the
stories that you've been storing up. <p>
"So if you take a close look at the media you'll discover that the really smart
reporters often are coming out with things in that window of opportunity that
opens up in reaction to the scandal. <p>
"On top of that there is just plenty of people with integrity and who are
really working hard to stretch the limits, and sometimes they get things
through."<p>
Chomsky describes a good friend of his who is a leading television reporter for
ABC News in the United States. The journalist, Charles Glass, is a specialist
on the Middle East. Chomsky heard about a story he was working on when they
shared a cross-Atlantic flight. <p>
"He'd been working hard to find out something on the Iraqi biological warfare
capacities. They were being denied in the United States, because Saddam Hussein
was a big friend so it was denied that this was going on. This was a couple of
months before the invasion of Kuwait."<p>
Glass had discovered the information through some high level Iraqi leaks, and
by examining material from French commercial satellites - something US spy
satellites would have also discovered.. "He had put together a solid story and
the American ABC was willing to allow him to run it.<p>
"He got to New York and went on television and had his two minutes," says
Chomsky.<p>
"Then ABC News immediately shifted to their correspondent in Washington, some
big shot who interviewed a Pentagon official, who said, no nothing of this sort
was happening. Of course it was true but it wasn't the right story at the time.
<p>
"If you happened to be watching televison from the outside it would look like
some reporter went off on a loose end, and dug up some nutty stuff, but serious
people deny it. <p>
"But if you were paying attention [you] would probably say that was true
otherwise they wouldn't be bothered denying it that promptly. And besides it
makes perfect sense anyway after the gassings and so on, and of course it was
true.<p>
"Well those are ways in which material leaks through thanks to the integrity of
particular people."<p>
So, Chomsky says, there are all sorts of complexities, but still the major
factors of the Propaganda Model are demonstrated to be correct. "In fact the
bulk of that book is documentation of the way it worked in particular and
dramatic cases. As far as I know it is the best established thesis of the
social sciences by a long shot, that factors like these determine the media
product."<p>
In Manufacturing Consent, Chomsky argues that the media establishes and defends
the agenda of the dominant privileged groups in society. "The media serve this
purpose in many ways: through selection of topics, distribution of concerns,
framing of issues, filtering of information, emphasis and tone, and by keeping
debate within the bounds of acceptable premises."<p>
But Chomsky believes journalists can try to do things differently.<p>
"There's plenty of opportunities to do very good work," says Chomsky. "Take say
Brian Toohey, he gets things through. There's plenty of other people. <p>
"There's going to be strains, and you'll be pressing against limits. If you go
too far they'll turn you off; if you keep at it too much you may be thrown out.
But within that framework there are plenty of things to do. <p>
"Actually academic scholarship isn't all that different. If people start
breaking out of the expected framework - if they are esoteric enough it may not
matter - but if they are anywhere near issues of policy of power, they may find
themselves in trouble. <p>
"I know plenty of journalists who've been told look you're getting too
emotional why don't you take off a bit of time and go to the metro desk and
work on that sort of thing. <p>
"The famous case in the United States, Ray Bonner, who was a freelance
journalist, was working for the Times. They didn't have any journalist in El
Salvador in the early 80s, and he's a good serious honest journalist - no
special training, but afterall what's it take?<p>
"He discovered a huge massacre, and the State Department denied it. Of course
it's completely true - we know by now exactly it was true - and the Times
pulled him out. They claimed that they pulled him out because he needed more
experience.<p>
"So they sent him off to the financial desk where he'd kind of really learn the
trade of being a journalist. He's no fool and he just quit after a while."<p>
Chomsky says there are many examples of journalists' efforts being stymied,
particularly in reporting matters from the US's immediate region. "The first
major massacre in El Salvador happened to be in May in 1980 under Carter. It
was a crucial moment when the land reform was starting and the government
wanted to make sure that everybody got the idea - there's going to be formal
land reform but don't lift your head. <p>
"So they carried out a huge massacre. It was actually a joint operation of the
Salvadorans and the Honduran Armies."<p>
Chomsky believes the action was co-ordinated by the United States. "It's called
the Rio Sumpul massacre," he says. "One big massacre, and maybe 600 people,
women and children, were slaughtered."<p>
There were plenty of witnesses to the events, says Chomsky, including local
people and priests. It received brief coverage in the international media. "A
very good British journalist David Blundy, who's since died, he reported it in
the Times," Chomsky says.<p>
"In the United States, it still has not been mentioned. I mean I've written
about it, but it has not been mentioned. That's the first big massacre
co-ordinated action of the two armies that were anything but friendly which
suggests something. And it is not mentioned. <p>
"The UN Truth Commission report just released a study of it and it included it,
and then it got like a line somewhere, but that's it. This happens all the
time. Wrong story, totally wrong story."<p>
There's some even more dramatic cases," says Chomsky. "In Cambodia, which
people pretend that they are concerned about, US bombing started around `69. By
1971 about a third of the population were already refugees, according to US
government sources, so who knows what happened. <p>
"Doubtless tens of thousands of people were killed. By 1973 there were over a
million refugees in Phnom Penh. Then the serious bombing started. The peak
bombing was early `73 through late `73. <p>
"There were plenty of reporters in Phnom Penh including the ones like Sydney
Schanberg who's considered the conscience of the press, you know a big hero. He
was the Times reporter there. <p>
"I went through all of his reporting - it's in Manufacturing Consent. ... Sort
of like [William] Shawcross and the Timorese."<p>
In Chomsky's 1993 book Year 501, he describes Shawcross explaining that East
Timor failed to get the extent of coverage as did Cambodia due to "a
comparative lack of sources".<p>
"What happened in the early half of the decade is virtually unknown. What
happened in the latter half of the decade is the main focus of inquiry because
you can blame it on someone else. The CIA which wouldn't be likely to
underestimate it, estimates in its demographic study, 600,000 killed in the
first half of the decade. So it's not small whatever it was. <p>
"Try to find out something about it and the reason nothing is known is because
the journalists refused to report it. They wouldn't talk to the refugees.<p>
"Actually it is even more nuanced if you look at it closely. There was one
atrocity which was reported. In fact if you saw the film, The Killing Fields,
it starts off with an American atrocity - they bombed a village. <p>
"And that one was reported for three solid days. Shocked Schanbergs went out
there, why? They hit the wrong village. It was a mistake. You know they were
aiming at some other village. So therefore you could report it within the
framework: `you were allowed to make mistakes'. <p>
"So yes, that was graphically reported, with the torn up bodies: `Isn't it
awful we made a mistake'. How about the times we didn't make a mistake? You
know that we don't report it. <p>
"If you internalise these values you can make it in the media. If you don't
like those values and you report one of the other ones, you'll get cut off
somewhere along the line."<p>
Some media theorists, such as Stuart Hall, refer more to the structures of news
production such as the professional demands on journalists for impartiality,
balance and objectivity as the cause of over-accessing to the media of those in
powerful and privileged institutional positions. Fact and opinion become
distinguished not by the journalist but by their `accredited sources'.<p>
But Chomsky believes that those professional qualities in journalists need not
necessarily lead to over-accessing of the social realities of the powerful. He
thinks that it is possible for journalists to remain independent while working
according to professional standards.<p>
"Yes I do. Here I disagree with a lot of my friends. I think objectivity and
impartiality are goals that one can try to achieve," says Chomsky."You're not
going to achieve them. You know you always have too many biases and
preconditions and so on. But you try to become aware of them. <p>
"It's just like science. You can't do scientific work without preconceptions of
what you expect to find and so on, but if you are rational at least you try to
be conscious of them and hold them up to inquiry, willingly to give them up. <p>
"But objectivity is a goal to which you can strive, knowing perfectly well that
there's many factors that are going to prevent you from succeeding.<p>
"Some of the best journalists I know of - I don't know them personally - are
people that think they are either apolitical or politically pretty reactionary,
but just very good at telling you what's there."<p>
The alternative press is also at times guilty of partisan reporting, of blindly
repeating statements. Chomsky says that such reporting can be "very distorted".
"Some of the best reporting around is in journals like the Wall Street Journal
and the Financial Times of London. They have professional reporting."<p>
The reason that governments manipulate the media and lie to their publics is
because of their fear of what the public may do with knowledge about what is
really going on around them, argues Chomsky. He says that with East Timor, the US and Australian governments have tried to keep secret the truth of events there.<p>
"They are afraid they can't keep their own public in check," he says.<p>
"Take the United States which has played the decisive role. It's not playing
the decisive role any more; it's backing off. It's not that they got to be nice
people. There's just enough pressure. And the pressure is interesting, it's not
from the left. <p>
"So a lot of the strongest opponents of the US involvement here happen to very
rightwing people who it's been brought to their attention. And they don't like
it, but they're human beings. <p>
"It's been brought to their attention not because they read it in the New York
Times. It was brought to their attention by activists and the church, and
public efforts, pressure groups etcetera."<p>
Chomsky says there is no shortage of examples of this.<p>
"The first major story, really good story in the US media on East Timor, the
first accurate story, and to this day one of the best anywhere, happened to be
in the Boston Globe [Chomsky's home-town paper].<p>
The way it came about was this: The Boston Globe ran one of these standard
State Department handouts, you know, full of lies and so on. And I wrote a
letter to the editor of the Sunday section, and I told him this is all lies,
you shouldn't publish that kind of stuff. <p>
"He wrote me back and he called me, he didn't believe a word I said. And he
said `well can you prove anything you said', and I said `sure I can do it, but
why believe me. Why don't you get one of your reporters to look into it?'. <p>
"So he did, and it was good that he picked a local reporter. He didn't pick an
international correspondent. He picked some local guy who worked out of the
police court - a guy whose instincts are those of a journalist, to tell the
truth. <p>
"The guy didn't have very much international experience, but he was just a very
honest local reporter - there are plenty of people like that. He called me and
asked me what I knew. I gave him what I knew and I told him contacts. But I
told him not to pay too much attention to them. You know, just write. Why
should he pay attention to me? <p>
"He followed it up. He dug all kinds of stuff. He got this guy in the State
Department who'd been kicked off the Indonesia Desk because he was protesting
internally and then started leaking stuff to him, all kind of things. And he
wrote a terrific story. It's the first real story that came out. <p>
"Well that kind of thing can happen," says Chomsky. All of these are little
pieces of something. Everytime that one of these things happens, it lays the
basis for the next thing.<p>
"The same is true with the New York Times I should say. I can trace out in
precise detail how they got to the point of starting to report East Timor. <p>
"These things add up. It gradually gets to the point where perceptions change,
and expectations change and it's gotten to the point where the US is backing
off. Now that's an indication of how little it can take."<p>
But as an informed public begins to want to act on what they are now beginning
to find out, won't the level of media manipulation merely increase?<p>
"Sure, but they don't have to win," Chomsky says. "They don't have to win. They
can lose, and in this one they are losing.<p>
"It's kind of dramatic now in Australia. The US Congress finally just stopped
the sale of small arms. Okay, Australia moves in. Well you know you can stop it
here just as easily as you can there. <p>
"In Britain there's the dramatic case. Britain realised that the US is backing
off supplying the big arms, not rifles but jet planes. So they're delighted to
move in and kill as many people as they can as long as you can make money from it. <p>
"People like John Pilger are giving them a hard time. One of the reasons the
government hates him - much to his credit - and tells all kind of lies about
him, is because he's really giving them a hard time. <p>
"He exposes what they are doing. People read it. When his documentary [Death of a Nation, a film on East Timor] came out, the BBC switchboards were just jammed for hours by people who were furious to know. They don't want their government to be doing this, and governments have to respond. Even totalitarian governments have to respond to that kind of thing, and certainly relatively democratic ones do. <p>
"That leads to changes, and it also opens room for good journalists, serious
journalists. Once you have a space you can push a little harder, and your
editors won't stop you, and the owners won't stop you. And things just
interact, so finally you get substantial changes, on domestic things too."<p>
Chomsky's message for journalists is that there is a way of bringing
information to the public that many would prefer to see kept secret. His
message, in the face of his own theories of media dominance by the powerful
elites, is given with a surprising optimism.

<P><H2>Part I: Q & A</H2>

<P><TABLE WIDTH=66%><TR><TD>
<I>The following is a series of questions addressed to professor Noam Chomsky following a lecture he delivered at the University of Illinois at Chicago on October 17, 1994.</I>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Q:</B> Given that corporations seem to be needing us less and less and that the jobs that they offer are pretty lame anyway and tend to be very uninteresting, sucking the life out of people, it seems to me that there is an opportunity for people to actually do less boring things and do more of what's the real work in society in supporting each other and educating children and things like that. Have you thought about how the economic system has to change in order for that to really happen?</FONT>

<P><B>Noam:</B> First of all a lot of that is already happening so we don't have to look very far for models. Take the UNESCO study that I mentioned which is talking about the differences between the Anglo/American model and the Continental European/Japanese model. These are not very different kinds of societies. They're all corporate run but they happen to have somewhat different social policies for various historical reasons. Things like, for example, in Germany where there's a kind of Social Contract that we don't have, one of the biggest unions won a thirty-five hour week. In Sweden parents get substantial parental leave because taking care of children is supposed to be something that has some value in the society unlike here where the leadership elements hate families. They may talk about family values but they want families destroyed because families are not rational from the point of view of profit making. Another example is the Netherlands. Poverty among the elderly has gone down to flat zero. Among the children I think it's four percent or something, basically nothing. Even within the range of societies almost exactly like ours there's plenty of other social policies. After all why should absolutist organizations exist. Why should a corporation, a fascist organization of enormous power, have the right to tell you what kind of work you're going to do? Why is that any better than having a king tell you what kind of work you're going to do? We fought against that sort of thing and we can fight against it again. As you say there's plenty of challenging, gratifying, interesting work to do. There's plenty of people who want to do it. There's a lot of junky work to do, too. In a reasonable society that just ought to be distributed equally among everybody. The kind of work nobody wants to do. If you can't get robots to do it, okay. Distribute it equally. There is a lot of interesting work to do but people aren't being allowed to do it. It's not only poor people who aren't being allowed to do it. Contrary to all this idiocy about IQ, if you take, say, PhDs in Physics and Math at MIT, who rank pretty high by those standards, they're not being allowed to do what they want to do. In fact a lot of them are going on to do work that is at best useless and probably destructive and they might make a ton of money speculating on Wall Street. That's anti-social work and that's the kind of work that is privileged in this society.

<P>Actually, if you bother looking at these ridiculous books that are coming along, see what they ranked as high achievement occupations. It's things like accountant or public relations specialist--anti-social activities. It's as if we had a society which were rewarding pathological murderers. Any form of social arrangement which is in egalitarian is going to give rewards to certain characteristics. If you gave rewards to pathological murderers, fine. They'd be the guys on top. We happen to give rewards to people who have some combination of ruthlessness and avarice and self-seeking and lack of concern for others and so on. That's called success and people who have that strange contribution of traits are considered to be meritorious. So we have a meritocracy. If you actually look through the occupations it's got nothing to do with intellectual interest, with intelligence, certainly not with constructive activities. A lot of it is plainly anti-social. If you go to people as high as you like with whatever measure you choose, be it IQ or whatever nonsense that is. For example MIT physicists and mathematicians are driven into these anti-social activities just as in the past they were driven into things like making weapons to destroy the world. There's no reason for those choices to be made. They are not principles of gravitation. They're social decisions. They can be made differently and they could and would be made differently in a democratic, free society. So let's make a free society in which decisions are made differently.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Q:</B>We need a brief reference to Haiti. I'm having some trouble seeing how the present policy fits into the picture you've described. I wish you'd amplify that if you can.</FONT>

<P><B>Noam:</B> Basically what's happened in my opinion is the following. The US. has been supporting Haitian military dictators for almost 200 years. For the last twenty or thirty years the US. has been trying to turn Haiti into a kind of an export platform with super cheap labor and big profits and so on. In 1990 something happened that really surprised the hell out of them. There was this free election which everyone figured was going to be won by a World Bank candidate that the U.S. was backing. Meanwhile something had been going on in the slums and peasant communities which, as usual, no one was paying any attention to. Namely a lively and vibrant civil society was forming. Big grass roots organizations, people getting involved in things and so on. The CIA doesn't pay attention to things like that. Certainly journalists don't. So all of a sudden they come out of the woodwork and win the election. Catastrophe. The only question in any body's mind who knew anything about American History in December 1990 is "how are they going to get rid of this guy?" Well the US instantly began to undermine the Aristide Government. Aid and investment was cut off except for the business community to form counter-Aristide forces. The National Endowment for Democracy went in there to try to set up counter-institutions, by an odd accident exactly the ones that survived the coup.

<P>The Aristide regime was very successful, which made it even more dangerous. It was getting support from international lending institutions, cutting down on bureaucracy, putting the country in order. Really bad stuff. In September a coup came along, and Aristide was overthrown. Theoretically there was an embargo and sanctions but that was a pure fraud. The US. announced instantly that it was not paying any attention to the sanctions, meaning nobody else had to pay attention to them either. The Bush administration established what they called an exemption, meaning US.-owned firms were exempt from the embargo. The New York Times did a little work on that: they called it "fine-tuning the embargo." We didn't want Haitian people to suffer. And they only suffer when American-owned firms stop working. Meanwhile, U.S. trade with Haiti stays not very much below the norm. Under Clinton it went up by 50 percent. They put an illegal blockade around the country to drive the population back, which is totally illegal. But the trade barely decreased, though somehow the free press seemed to miss that. Nobody thought to do what I did, which was to give a call to the Commerce Department and ask for the trade figures. It takes like two minutes, and then you find out what happened. Somehow that's beyond the resources of the press so they never found out.

<P>The generals were virtually told, "Murder the leaders of the popular organizations, intimidate everyone, destroy people. We'll give you a certain amount of time to do it, and when we tell you the job is done you can go somewhere else and be very nicely treated. Don't worry, you'll then be rich for the rest of your lives." This is exactly what happened. When the time came they were told, "OK, time's up. You did your job."

<P>Incidentally, the day before the US. intervention, there was a big story that came across the AP wire, which means every newsroom in the country had the story the next day. The story was that there had been a Justice Department investigation which determined that the oil companies had been supplying oil to the military junta in violation of the embargo, which we pretty much knew, but they were doing it with the official authorization of the U.S. government at the highest level, which not everyone knew. In fact, the Secretary of the Treasury under Bush essentially said, "Yeah, it's illegal but don't worry about it." And this went on under Clinton too. So, out of curiosity, I did a NEXUS search, and that story did appear in the press the next day, in Platt's OilGram, which is essentially a newsletter for the oil industry. Within a few days it appeared in local papers, like in Dayton, Ohio. But of course that's because local editors aren't sophisticated enough to know what not to say. Now, a couple weeks later, it still hasn't appeared in the national press, except for a couple lines buried in the Wall Street Journal. This was the biggest story of the week. What it said is there were never any sanctions. Never. It gives the whole thing away. So now what happens? Well, American troops move in, telling the generals "go away", and Aristide is now going to be allowed back for a few months. Remember Clinton's speech where he says Aristide has shown what a great democrat he is? He's going to step down when the constitution says he has to step down. But the constitution doesn't say he has to step down in December 1995, Bill Clinton says he has to step down. The Haitian constitution says he's supposed to be in office for five years. The constitution doesn't deal with what happens in three of those five years are spent in forced exile. Only people who hate democracy as much as we do would say that counts. But if you believe in democracy, well that means that the people who voted for him (the overwhelming majority of the population) have a right to a five-year president. I don't think anyone in the United States has noticed this, though it's been pointed out in Canada. I haven't been able to find a word suggesting this in the U.S., reflecting the profundity of that contempt for democracy. So he's in for a year at most, his hands are tied, and there's an economic plan that's rammed down his throat by the World Bank. This was brought out by one of the few reporters in this country, Allan Nairn, who published it in the Multi-National Monito. It's an interesting plan, kind of the standard structural adjustment package. It's been referred to as the package Aristide is offering, and what it says, in a lot of nice words, is at the core that the renovated government must focus its energies and efforts on civil society, particularly export industries and foreign investors. That's Haitian civil society: investors in New York City. So those investors will come in and rebuild what we wanted Haiti to be, so it will have super-cheap labor and American agri-business driving out subsistence farming. So Aristide will be permitted to administer this program, to make sure he discredits himself. We're back to 1990, before the election, with one difference: the popular movements have been decimated.

<P>People in Haiti are happy, and if I were there I'd be happy too; at least the military and torturers aren't murdering them. It's like the choice is between water torture and electric torture -- I guess water torture is better, or so people say. But the hope for Haitian democracy, at least for the moment, is finished. They can go back to being an export platform again. Meanwhile there will be rousing speeches here about our love for democracy. Maybe in fifty years they'll even discover the business about the oil.

<P>There is an interesting historical footnote, if you're interested. The oil company that was authorized by the Treasury Department under Bush and Clinton happened to be Texaco. Both Shell and Exxon shipped oil there from their foreign subsidiaries, but Texaco was doing it directly from the U.S. They asked if it was OK to set up a blind trust, and were told that was illegal, but again not to worry about it. Now people my age, those that have a historical memory, might remember when the Roosevelt Administration was trying to undermine the Spanish Republic sixty years ago. This was during the Spanish Revolution, where the Republic was being attacked by Franco's fascist forces. Franco was being supported by Mussolini. In the U.S., the administration was strongly against the Republic because it was the danger of a popular revolution. One of the ways they did it was by of the Neutrality Act, where we weren't supposed to interfere with the Republic. Except the Neutrality Act was only 50% [abroad?] . The fascists were getting guns from Germany, but they didn't have any oil. But Texaco, which was run at that time by an outright Nazi, which wasn't so unusual in those days, had contracts with the Republic. They terminated those contracts, and contacted ships at sea to deliver the oil to the fascists instead, illegally of course. The press, somehow, was never able to discover that, except for the small left-wing press. But the big papers never had the resources to discover that. And this is what we're seeing in Haiti today.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Q:</B>Could you comment on the current policies of GATT, the whole notion of intellectual property rights, and the effect of these policies on food production in the Third World?</FONT>

<P><B>Noam:</B> That's a really important topic and in fact it was one I had hoped to talk about but didn't have time for. GATT is called a free trade agreement, just as NAFTA was, but that's nonsense. These things are not about free trade and they're certainly not agreements. In fact most of the people in the world are opposed to them. What you mentioned is an extreme case of that. Intellectual property rights have to do with protectionism. The U.S., and in fact the rich countries generally, have led the insistence that the GATT agreement, like NAFTA, include strong intellectual property rights. That's protectionism. That means increasing the power of patents. Patents are protectionist devices. They are designed to insure that the technology of the future is in the hands of transnational corporations, most of which, incidentally, you guys pay for. Remember they don't believe in a free market. They want to be publicly subsidized in research and development and controlled markets and so on. The strength of intellectual property rights means longer patents.

<P>Take India for instance. India has a big pharmaceutical industry. They can produce drugs at a fraction of the cost of what Merck wants to sell them for. In fact drug prices are way lower in India than in Pakistan next door because India happened to develop its own pharmaceutical industry. The American corporations don't like that. They want more children to die in India. It's not whether they care whether children die. They want more profit, which means more children die in India. They want to make sure India doesn't produce drugs at less than the cost of American drugs. Now this is done in two ways under GATT. One way is to increase the length of patents. The other is to change their character from process patents to product patents. That's very crucial. In the past patents were process patents. Like if Merck, thanks to your taxes, designed a way to produce a certain drug, and then say some smart guy in India figured out a cheaper way to produce that drug, that was allowed. We don't want that. We want to cut down technological innovation, cut back economic process, economic progress, and economic efficiency and increase profit. So now they are product patents. If Merck figures out a certain way to produce a drug they can hold that for twenty years because it's a product, and they can hold the process for another twenty years. They get forty years of holding on to that drug. By that time everybody's forgotten about it. There's some history about this. The developed countries like us never accepted anything like that. Even weak patents on technological development weren't accepted by the rich countries until just a few years ago. There was one time that I know of that product patents were actually tried, namely in France in the early part of the century that had such patents. That destroyed the French chemical industry. It moved to Switzerland. So Switzerland has a big chemical industry and not France. It's not a big secret. This is straight history and the people who are planning GATT understand it. They want to make sure that they destroy the Indian or Argentinean pharmaceutical industries the same way that France's dumb choices destroyed the French chemical industry. The New York Times a couple of weeks ago had a tiny ten line item stating that India (with a gun pointed at its head) agreed finally to liberalize their pharmaceutical industry, meaning sell it to western corporations. So drug prices will shoot sky high in India and children will die but there will be more profits. Now this has nothing to do with free trade. This is a high level of protectionism. In fact it is specifically designed even to be contrary to the narrow definitions of efficiency that they teach at the University of Chicago Economics Department. So it's going to cut down on technological innovations, efficiency and so on, but it will happen to increase profits by accident. Well, that's intellectual property rights. I gave one example but there are plenty of others like it. If you look over the whole GATT Agreement this is sort of a complicated array of protectionist and liberalizing devices very carefully geared to the interests of transnationals.

<P>As far as agriculture is concerned, the way of measuring the efficiency of agricultural production, which like most of these measures are just tax-based ideology that don't have anything to do with science, is to look at certain inputs and outputs and you do some calculations to figure out what the efficiency is. Some things are left out. If you do the calculations their way the cost of environmental pollution doesn't count. That's called an externality, which means they worry about it in some other department. There's another one you don't count.

<P>It usually turns out to be the case that heavily subsidized western agri-business tend to produce corn more efficiently than, say, Mexican peasants. If you do a narrow measure of the highly ideological type that they teach you about in economics departments it will turn out to be more efficient for the world if American agri-business produces corn with big petroleum inputs than if Mexican peasants do it, but there's a few things left out of that calculation. One thing that's left out is that ten to fifteen million Mexican peasants will be driven off the land. They're going to be driven into cities where they're going to starve. There's a lot of costs associated with that. Put aside the human cost which nobody cares about. Just take the straight economic costs like taking care of them somehow. Well, that's somebody else's department. We don't count that one in.

<P>Put all this stuff together and you get particular choices. This is a game of class warfare masked in big words so it sounds like science and mathematical formulas. If you ask common sense questions you see all kinds of things are left out. If you're sending corn to Mexico you've got to put it in trucks. What about transit costs? The purpose of these agreements is to ensure that agricultural production is monopolized by transnationals and that the third world gets nothing. If you read the Indian press you may have noticed that Indian customs officials stopped some alleged German scientists at the border who were leaving India with some funny stuff in their bags, namely a couple hundred thousand bugs. They didn't know what the hell they're doing with these things but we know. That's the gene pool that western pharmaceutical companies are trying to steal from the south. Those are their resources but we get them for free. For thousands of years people in the south have been developing crops. They don't own them. They don't get any rights from that. We just go in and steal them. So they have the rich gene pool and the thousands of years of experience in creating hybrids and figuring out what herb works. Then western corporations go in and take it for nothing, just check if they've got a piece of paper anywhere that says they own it, stamped by the authorities. Therefore we steal it from them and it appears in some biology lab. We minimally modify it and sell it to them. We patent it. It's a scam designed to rob the poor and enrich the rich, like most social policy. That shouldn't surprise you. After all, who made social policy? This was a truism of Adam Smith. The people who make social policy make it in their interest. They wouldn't be in a position to make social policy if they weren't rich and privileged. People suffer.

<P><H2>Part II:
<BR>21st Century: Democracy or Absolutism</H2>
</CENTER>

<P>There's a familiar story about the new era that we're entering and the promise that it holds. In brief, to borrow some of the appropriate imagery, the good guys won the shoot-out and they're firmly in the saddle riding off into the sunset. There's some rough terrain ahead but nothing that they can't handle as they lead the way to a bright future, which is going to be based on the ideals that they have always cherished like human rights, democracy, and free markets. A future which in which what we say goes, as George Bush defined the New World Order to great acclaim, great acclaim in the west that is, but the vast majority of the population of the world had a somewhat different reaction, but that was unreported except at the usual margins.

<P>Well, I'm going to skip representative quotes to illustrate the picture. You've all seen enough of it. Actually the quotes are kind of interesting but time is short and I have a very authoritarian manager tonight. So I'll skip that and we'll also skip the typical vulgarities and the blithe disregard for historical and contemporary reality that goes along with it. Now I don't want to suggest that everybody is just telling fairy tales and lies. There are some who tell the truth and sometimes they do it in interesting ways. With regards to take, say, democracy, the United States as you all know is deeply committed to a campaign to bring democracy to the benighted people of Latin America over the hemisphere in the 1980s and there was actually some interesting commentary on that, scholarly commentary, including some of the best of which is a book and several articles by a man who actually has an insiders perspective. His name is Thomas Carruthers who was in the Reagan State Department in the 1980s involved in the Democracy Enhancement Programs as they were called and has written very interestingly about them. He regards these programs as sincere but a failure, although a very systematic failure as he points out, and he's honest enough to point out the systematic character of the failure is this: Where US influence was the least there you found the most progress towards democracy. So, in the southern cone of the hemisphere there was progress toward democracy. People overthrew vicious, brutal, neo-nazi dictatorships that had been established by or with the support of the United Sates and maintained by the U.S. but they were overthrown. The Reagan Administration resisted bitterly the attempt to overthrow its favored dictators but when that proved hopeless and the move toward democracy was irreversible they then took credit for it. That was -- there was a success of democracy. When you got closer to home as Carruthers pointed and our influence was greater, the progress toward democracy was least and, in fact, as he put it where the U.S. had influence it sought only limited, top down forms of democracy that did not risk upsetting the traditional structures of power with which the United States had long been allied. It maintained the basic order of quite undemocratic societies avoiding populist-based change that might upset the established economic and political order and open a leftist direction.

<P>That's how we enhance democracy where we have some influence. So there was a kind of failure, more or less the same sort of failure of the Soviet Union to achieve freedom and democracy in Eastern Europe despite its deeply committed effort. You can get a better picture of the nature of the failure, and the kinds of democracies we try to impose, by actually looking at particular cases. There isn't a lot of time so I'll just take some easy ones. Take in the area most under our control, Central America, traditionally. There's one country that was uniquely favored in the 1980s, namely Honduras. It's the only country in the region that wasn't under direct, physical attack by the United States or by its proxy forces and was also uniquely favored in that it actually received quite a lot of assistance as it became a base for U.S. attack against the rest of the region. So it was in a particularly good position for the Democracy Enhancement Programs and indeed there was what was called a decade of democracy in Honduras. As the Cold War came to an end and the Berlin Wall fell in November 1989 Honduras had elections, its third elections. There were two candidates so it was a real election. One represented large land owners. The other represented wealthy industrialists. There were no differences in their programs that anybody could detect including them. There was no campaign, just insults and entertainment and so on. Neither of them challenged the Military who are the effective rulers under U.S. control. There's a regular level of human rights abuses by the security forces and it escalated before the election just to keep peoples minds focused properly. But it never reached the level of, say, El Salvador and Guatemala where it was just like mass murder and genocide. The starvation and misery were rampant throughout the country. They had increased extensively during the decade of democracy from quite a low level in the first place thanks to those neo-liberal programs, agri-export programs, that were pushed by U.S. aid and U.S. advisers and unprecedented U.S. aid which led to an unprecedented human disaster as everyone can see it's on all sides. While starvation and misery were increasing so were other things like capital flight, increasing very fast, profits for foreign investors and the debt burden. That was the decade of democracy. So, therefore, the elections that were held in November 1989 were an inspiring example of the democratic process that today is spreading throughout the Americas as George Bush declared, no less inspiring than the elections in El Salvador in 1982 and 1984 when the opposition leaders were safely murdered and civil society was demolished by US run terrorists called security forces so therefore the press could speak of the encouraging progress toward democracy. Or, for example, the election in Panama in 1984 that was won by general Noriega with considerable violence and obvious fraud and was hailed by the Reagan administration even before the fraudulent numbers were invented. The Reagan Administration recognized Noriegas candidate and sent George Schmaltz down there to laud Noriega for another inspiring achievement at democracy. Remember he was our man at that time. That was before he stopped following orders and became a bad guy who had to be destroyed. Honduras was another case. The next most privileged country in Central America after Honduras was Nicaragua. Nicaragua was under attack from a terrorist superpower but it was unique -- I'm putting Costa Rica aside -- it was the only country of the region in which the security forces were not dedicated to attacking the domestic population. Rather they were defending the population from a terrorist attack organized from abroad. So it too was uniquely privileged in a way and it had an election in 1984, highly regarded outside the United States and by the professional Association of Latin American Scholars in the United States, but out of history because it couldn't be controlled by the United States and therefore it didn't take place. Also out of history is the fact that there was another election scheduled for 1990. You're not allowed to say that because the official story is that the 1990 election was held only because of US pressure. Therefore the fact that it was always scheduled is also out of history. But indeed there was a 1990 election which is allowed into history in part. If you look at it tells you a lot about the United States and about the elite culture and about the conception that is held. It fills out even more of the story that Carruthers describes rather coolly. As the Berlin Wall fell and Honduras went through this inspiring example of democracy there was an announcement from the White House to the Nicaraguans that they had a choice. They could vote for the US candidate or they would be subjected to continuing terror and embargo. They had a free choice. We believe in freedom. So they had that choice and they were told that in very clear terms. It's not that the Democrats disagreed. The Congress was run by the Democrats. Congress immediately passed in volition of the plea of the Central American Presidents military aid to the terrorist forces attacking Nicaragua. Here that was called humanitarian aid but the world court had already ruled on that fact and had declared that it is not humanitarian aid, that it cannot be considered humanitarian aid, that it's military aid. But, again, that's the wrong fact so therefore that one is out of history too. Accordingly a mere hundred percent of commentary described it as humanitarian aid. The United Nations once again in vain condemned the US dispatch of military aid to the terrorist forces. It wasn't a hundred percent. The United States and Israel voted against it and that one is out of history. In fact it wasn't reported. In Nicaragua they understood. Outside of places where people have a good education like here it was well understood what was going on. So they had a choice. They voted the right way. They voted for the US candidate. The reaction here was extremely interesting. In fact in Latin America, south of the border, where the press is mostly pretty conservative to reactionary, they applauded the victory. They nevertheless called it a victory for George Bush. Here they called it a victory for freedom. Not just that. There was complete euphoria. Headlines on the New York Times were "Victory for U.S. Fair Play. Americans United in Joy" kind of like North Korea or Albania or something like that. Way at the critical end you had people like Anthony Lewis. He was just exultant about what he called "this romantic age." "We live in a romantic age," he said, where the Jeffersonian ideal of government by consent of the governed is spreading everywhere. Incidentally the methods by which the great victory for Jeffersonian Democracy was achieved were not concealed.

<P>In fact they were described with some clarity. Here's Time Magazine rejoicing over what it called "the latest of the happy series of democratic surprises" as democracy burst forth in Nicaragua. Then they described the victory for US fair play as follows. The method was to wreck the economy and prosecute a long and deadly proxy war until the exhausted natives overthrow the unwanted government themselves with a cost to us that is minimal leaving the victim with wrecked bridges, sabotaged power stations and ruined farms providing Washington's candidate with a winning issue ending the impoverishment of the people of Nicaragua. So that's Jeffersonian Democracy in our romantic age and a victory for US fair play. All of that reveals with quite extraordinary clarity that democracy is not just disliked in the elite culture but it is hated with utter contempt. It's hard to exaggerate the contempt but it's made very clear by these examples. Let me finish running through these with Honduras, again the uniquely privileged country. In November 1993, last year, they had another election. It was the fourth one since 1980 so the decade of democracy is really established. They voted against the neo-liberal structural adjustment programs and whats called the economic miracle that they're bringing. They voted strongly against it. But, no problem, as was widely recognized that gesture was completely empty. The rich and the powerful will permit nothing else so the programs go on anyways. To borrow a phrase from the London Economist a policy is insulated from politics. In other words policy goes on in one way and those guys can play around with votes in another way if they feel like it. They happened to be talking about Poland and they were telling foreign investors, "don't worry about the fact that they're voting against the programs you guys like. Policy is insulated from politics now that we've brought democracy to Poland." Well democracy was brought to Honduras too so however the population votes the neo-liberal policies that have brought misery and destruction and the economic miracle as this is called technically will go on. Well, I don't think it was ever reported here, at least I didn't see any report, and my local consultant from Chicago didn't send me any reports from Chicago. It was reported south of the border. Mexico's leading newspaper Excelsior pointed out that "the voters have no real options for improving their living standards which worsen every day." Remember they're familiar with economic miracles from their own country. Continuing, "Three quarters of those who went to the polls live in misery and are disenchanted with formal democracy. The purchasing power of Hondurans is lower than in the 1970's. The rule of the generals is more firmly established." There are other beneficiaries of the economic miracle as well. The Honduran College of Economists pointed out "A group of privileged exporters and local investors make the financial capital and multinational corporations have multiplied their capital in a country where growing economic polarization is generating ever more evident contrasts between the rich who do not hide the ostentation of their moral misery, and the ever more miserable poor." So that's the decade of democracy now we've had four elections. They also point out that at least one out of every two dollars that goes to Honduras comes right back to pay the interest on the foreign debt which is rowing. Even though twenty percent of the debt was forgiven it's increased by ten percent since 1990 alone. It now represents about forty percent of exports. Well that is the most favored country we run, to which we've brought democracy.

<P>Just a couple of weeks ago there was an election in Guatemala. That's on we've been taking care of for a long, long time so you can really see our values at work. It was going to be a showcase for democracy when we invaded it and overthrew the democratic government in 1954. They had an election a couple of weeks ago. The person who won the election was Rios Mott who is someone that would have gotten along quite well with Himmler and Goebels. He's the biggest killer in the recent history of Guatemala. He killed tens of thousands of people before he was overthrown in another military coup. He was a man who was totally dedicated to democracy as President Reagan said in a speech when Rios Mott was busy slaughtering people in the highlands. He just won the election. Less than twenty percent of the population bothered to vote. Mostly rich white people. Rios Mott got a third of the votes, about seven percent of the electorate, but that puts him in power so we have another victory for democracy. We've just seen the same thing in Haiti if we open our eyes.

<P>Meanwhile the US has been fostering other values besides democracy in the regions which it really controls. One value that it has been sponsoring is torture. As has been shown repeatedly US foreign aid is very closely correlated with torture. The leading specialist on human rights in Latin America, Lars Schmaltz, did a study on this published around 1980 in which he pointed out that the correlation is quite close. US foreign aid that flows into Latin America flows to the most egregious violators of fundamental human rights, to countries that torture their citizens. That's also true on a world scale as shown in other studies, including by my colleague Edward Herman. That was in 1980, running through the Carter years. Nobody's bothered to do a study in the last ten or fifteen years because it's too trivial. The correlation just went through the roof.

<P>To take a current case the biggest human rights violator in the hemisphere now is Columbia. Its record is absolutely atrocious. It's also the leading recipient of US aid. About fifty percent of US military aid to the hemisphere goes to Columbia, to the security forces that are carrying out the atrocities. So the correlation is maintained.

<P>Another value we've been sponsoring in Latin America is starvation, misery, death from disease and radical inequality. It's the region that has the highest inequality in the world. The World Bank in fact recently warned that the inequality is so great that there is a crisis coming. You can read about that in the business press but what you don't read about is the causes. It's not in their genes. This is the result to a large extent of social policy and in fact you can trace it. We're a free society so you can et documentary records. In 1945, when the United States was organizing the world it was able to take over Latin America kicking out its traditional rivals Britain and France, there was a meeting which was going to establish what was called an economic charter for the hemisphere. It was designed for economic growth in the hemisphere. There were two positions. As the State Department put it throughout Latin America there was what was called the philosophy of new nationalism, sometimes called economic nationalism. It was based on the principle that development ought to be egalitarian and to the benefit of the general population. As they put it "the prime beneficiaries of a country's resources should be its own population and development should be concerned with their interests and should be egalitarian." Now the US was strongly opposed to this. It's position was that economic nationalism in any form must be blocked, that the prime beneficiaries of a country's resources are not the people of that country rather it's foreign investors meaning US investors and there was to be none of this economic nationalism. In fact the US insisted that the development of Latin America countries be complimentary to the United States. So, we'll do what we're good at and they'll do what their good at and what they're good at is giving us resources and cheap labor and maybe doing some simple operations that we don't want to waste our time on. That's the way it works. The US was powerful enough to establish those principles and the result that you get is what you see today. Well, those are other values that we've sponsored in the areas of our control in addition to democracy.

<P>
The topic that was suggested, which I'm very happy to talk about, is
"Democracy and Education." The phrase democracy and education
immediately brings to mind the life and work and thought of one of the
outstanding thinkers of the past century, John Dewey, who devoted the
greater part of his life and his thought to this array of issues. I guess I
should confess a special interest. It just happened that this was for
various reasons, his thought was a strong influence on me in my formative
years -- in fact, from about age two on, for a variety of reasons that I won't
go into but are real. For much of his life, later he was more skeptical,
Dewey seems to have felt that reforms in early education could be in
themselves a major lever of social change. They could lead the way to a more
just and free society, a society in which in his words, "The ultimate aim of
production is not production of goods, but the production of free human
beings associated with one another on terms of equality." This basic
commitment, which runs through all of Dewey's work and thought, is
profoundly at odds with the two leading currents of modern social
intellectual life, one, strong in his day -- he was writing in the 1920s and
1930s about these things -- is associated with the command economies in
Eastern Europe in that day, the systems created by Lenin and Trotsky and
turned into an even greater monstrosity by Stalin. The other, the state
capitalist industrial society being constructed in the U.S. and much of the
West, with the effective rule of private power. These two systems are
actually similar in fundamental ways, including ideologically. Both were,
and one of them remains, deeply authoritarian in fundamental commitment, and
both were very sharply and dramatically opposed to another tradition, the
left libertarian tradition, with roots in Enlightenment values, a tradition
that included progressive liberals of the John Dewey variety, independent
socialists like Bertrand Russell, the leading elements of the Marxist
mainstream, mostly anti-Bolshevik, and of course libertarian socialists of
various anarchist movements, not to speak of major parts of the labour
movement and other popular sectors.

<P>This independent left, of which Dewey was a part, has strong roots in
classical liberalism. It grows right out of it, in my opinion, and it stands
in sharp opposition to the absolutist currents of state capitalist
and state socialist institutions and thought, including the rather
extreme form of absolutism that's now called conservative in the U.S.,
terminology that would have amused Orwell and would have caused any genuine
conservative to turn over in his grave, if you could find one.

<P>I need not stress that this picture is not the conventional one, to put it
rather mildly, but I think it does have one merit, at least, namely the
merit of accuracy. I'll try to explain why.

<P>Let me return to one of Dewey's central themes, that the ultimate aim of
production is not production of goods but the production of free human
beings associated with one another on terms of equality. That includes, of
course, education, which was a prime concern of his. The goal of education,
to shift over to Bertrand Russell, is "to give a sense of the value of
things other than domination, to help create wise citizens of a free
community, to encourage a combination of citizenship with liberty,
individual creativeness, which means that we regard a child as a gardener
regards a young tree, as something with an intrinsic nature which will
develop into an admirable form given proper soil and air and light." In
fact, much as they disagreed on many other things, as they did, Dewey and
Russell were perhaps the two leading thinkers of the twentieth century in
the West, in my opinion. They did agree on what Russell called this
humanistic conception, with its roots in the Enlightenment, the idea that
education is not to be viewed as something like filling a vessel with water,
but rather assisting a flower to grow in its own way. It's an
eighteenth-century view which they revived, in other words providing the
circumstances in which the normal creative patterns will flourish.

<P>Dewey and Russell also shared the understanding that these leading ideas of
the Enlightenment and classical liberalism had a revolutionary character,
and they retained it right at the time they were writing, in the early half
of this century. If implemented, these ideas could produce free human beings
whose values were not accumulation and domination but rather free
association on terms of equality and sharing and cooperation, participating
on equal terms to achieve common goals which were democratically conceived.
There was only contempt for what Adam Smith called the "vile maxim of the
masters of mankind, all for ourselves, and nothing for other people." The
guiding principle that nowadays we're taught to admire and revere as
traditional values have eroded under unremitting attack, the so-called
conservatives leading the onslaught in recent decades.

<P>It's worth taking time to notice how sharp and dramatic is the clash of
values between on the one hand the humanistic conception that runs from the
Enlightenment up to leading twentieth century figures like Russell and Dewey
and on the other hand the prevailing doctrines of today, the doctrines that
were denounced by Adam Smith as the "vile maxim" and also denounced by the
lively and vibrant working class press of a century ago, which condemned
what it called the "new spirit of the age, gain wealth, forgetting all but
self." Smith's vile maxim. It's from 1850 or so, from the working class
press in the U.S.

<P>It's quite remarkable to trace the evolution of values from a pre-capitalist
thinker like Adam Smith, with his stress on sympathy and the goal of perfect
equality and the basic human right to creative work, to contrast that and
move on to the present to those who laud the new spirit of the age,
sometimes rather shamelessly invoking Adam Smith's name. For example, Nobel
Prize winning economist James Buchanan, who writes that "what each person
seeks in an ideal situation is mastery over a world of slaves." That's what
you seek, in case you hadn't noticed. Something that an Adam Smith would
have regarded as simply pathological. The best book I know of on Adam
Smith's actual thought (Adam Smith and His Legacy From Capitalism) is
written by a professor here at Loyola, Patricia Werhane. That's Adam Smith's
actual views. Of course, it's always best to read the original.

<P>One of the most dramatic illustrations of this new spirit of the age and its
values is the commentary that's now in the press on the difficulties we face
in uplifting the people of Eastern Europe. As you know, we're now extending
to them, our new beneficiaries, the loving care that we've lavished on our
wards elsewhere in Latin America and the Philippines and so on; with the
consequences that are dramatically clear and consistent in these horror
chambers but also are miraculously free of any lessons about who we are and
what we do. One might ask why. In any event, we are now proceeding to uplift
the people liberated from communism as we've in the past liberated Haitians
and Brazilians and Guatemalans and Filipinos and Native Americans and
African slaves and so on. The New York Times is currently running an
interesting series of articles on these different problems. They give some
interesting insight into the prevailing values. There was an article on East
Germany, for example, written by Steven Kinzer. It opens by quoting a priest
who was one of the leaders of the popular protests against the communist
regime in East Germany. He describes the growing concerns there about what's
happening to the society. He says, "Brutal competition and the lust for
money are destroying our sense of community, and almost everyone feels a
level of fear or depression or insecurity" as they master the new spirit of
the age in which we instruct the backward peoples of the world.

<P>The next article turned to what we regard as the showplace, the real success
story, Poland, written by Jane Perlez. The headline reads "Fast and Slow
Lanes on the Capitalist Road." The structure of the story is that some are
getting the point but there are also some who are still backwards. She gives
one example of a good student and one example of a slow learner. The good
student is the owner of a small factory which is a "thriving example of the
best in modern capitalist Poland. It produces intricately designed wedding
gowns sold mostly to rich Germans and to that tiny sector of super-rich
Poles." This is in a country where poverty has more than doubled since the
reforms were instituted, according to a World Bank study last July, and
incomes have dropped about thirty percent. However, the people who are
hungry and jobless can look at the intricately designed wedding gowns in the
store windows, appreciating the new spirit of the age, so it's
understandable that Poland is hailed as the great success story for our
achievements. This good student explains that "people have to be taught to
understand they must fight for themselves and can't rely on others." She is
describing a training course she's running that's trying to instil American
values among people who are still brainwashed with slogans like, "I'm a
miner. Who else is better?" They have got to get that out of their heads. A
lot of people are better, namely people who can design wedding gowns for
rich Germans.

<P>That's the chosen illustration of the success story of American values. Then
there are the failures, still on the slow lane on the capitalist road. Here
she picks one as her example, a forty-year-old coal miner who "sits in his
wood-paneled living room admiring the fruit of his labour under communism: a
TV set, comfortable furniture, a shiny, modern kitchen, and he wonders why
he's at home, jobless and dependent on welfare payments," having not yet
absorbed the new spirit of the age, gain wealth, forgetting all but self,
and not "I'm a miner. Who else is better?" The series goes on like that.
It's interesting to read and to see what's taken for granted.

<P>What's happening in Eastern Europe recapitulates what's gone on in our Third
World domains for a long time and falls into place in a much longer story.
It's very familiar from our own history and the history of England before
us. There's a recent book, by a distinguished Yale University labour
historian, David Montgomery, in which he points out that modern America was
created over the protests of its working people. He's quite right. Those
protests were vigorous and outspoken, particularly in the working class and
community press that flourished in the U.S. from the early nineteenth
century up until the 1930s, when it was finally destroyed by private power,
as its counterpart in England was about thirty years later. The first major
study of this topic was in 1924 by Norman Ware. It still makes very
illuminating reading. It was published here in Chicago and reprinted very
recently by Ivan Dee, a local publisher. It's very much worth reading. It's
a work that set off a very substantial study in social history.

<P>What Ware describes, looking mostly at the labour press, is how the value
system that was advocated by private power had to be beaten into the heads
of ordinary people, who had to be taught to abandon normal human sentiments
and to replace them with the new spirit of the age, as they called it. He
reviews the mainly mid-nineteenth century working class press, often,
incidentally, run by working class women. The themes that run through it are
very constant for a long period. They are concerned with what they call
"degradation" and "loss of dignity and independence, loss of self-respect,
the decline of the worker as a person, the sharp decline in cultural level
and cultural attainments as workers were subjected to," what they called,
"wage slavery," which they regarded as not very different from chattel
slavery, which they had fought to uproot during the Civil War. Particularly
dramatic and quite relevant to today's problems was the sharp decline in
what we call "high culture," reading of classics and contemporary literature
by the people who were called the factory girls in Lowell and by craftsmen
and other workers. Craftsmen would hire somebody to read to them while they
were working because they were interested and had libraries. All that had to
go.

<P>What they described, quoting from the labour press, is "when you sell your
product, you retain your person. But when you sell your labour, you sell
yourself, losing the rights of free men and becoming vassals of mammoth
establishments of a monied aristocracy that threatens annihilation to anyone
who questions their right to enslave and oppress. Those who work in the
mills ought to own them, not have the status of machines ruled by private
despots who are entrenching monarchic principles on democratic soil as they
drive downwards freedom and rights, civilization, health, morals and
intellectuality in the new commercial feudalism." Just in case you are
confused, this is long before Marxism. This is American workers talking
about their experiences in the 1840s.

<P>The labour press also condemned what they called the "bought priesthood,"
referring to the media and the universities and the intellectual class, that
is, the apologists who sought to justify the absolute despotism that was the
new spirit of the age and to instil its sordid and demeaning values. One of
the early leaders of the AFL, about a century ago, late nineteenth century,
expressed the standard view when he described the mission of the labour
movement as "to overcome the sins of the market and to defend democracy by
extending it to control over industry by working people."

<P>All of this would have been completely intelligible to the founders of
classical liberalism, people like Wilhelm von Humboldt, for example, who
inspired John Stuart Mill, and who very much like his contemporary Adam
Smith regarded creative work freely undertaken in association with others as
the core value of a human life. So if a person produces an object on
command, Humboldt wrote, we may admire what he did but we will despise what
he is, not a true human being who acts on his own impulses and desires. The
bought priesthood have the task of undermining these values and destroying
them among people who sell themselves on the labour market. For similar
reasons, Adam Smith warned that in any civilised society governments would
have to intervene to prevent the division of labour from turning people into
"creatures as stupid and ignorant as it's possible for a human being to be."
He based his rather nuanced advocacy of markets on the thesis that if
conditions were truly free, markets would lead to perfect equality. That was
their moral justification. All of this has been forgotten by the bought
priesthood, who have a rather different tale to tell.

<P>Dewey and Russell are two of the leading twentieth-century inheritors of
this tradition, with its roots in the Enlightenment and classical
liberalism. Even more interesting is the inspiring record of struggle and
organization and protest by working men and women since the early nineteenth
century as they sought to win freedom and justice and to retain the rights
that they had once had as the new despotism of state-supported private power
extended its sway. The basic issue was formulated with a good deal of
clarity by Thomas Jefferson around 1816. This was before the Industrial
Revolution had really taken root in the former colonies but you could begin
to see the developments. In his later years, observing what was happening,
Jefferson had rather serious concerns about the fate of the democratic
experiment. He feared the rise of a new form of absolutism that was more
ominous than what had been overthrown in the American Revolution, in which
he was of course a leader. Jefferson distinguished in his later years
between what he called "aristocrats" and "democrats." The aristocrats are
"those who fear and distrust the people, and wish to draw all powers from
them into the hands of the higher classes." The democrats, in contrast,
"identify with the people, have confidence in them, cherish and consider
them as the honest and safe depository of the public interest, if not always
the most wise." The aristocrats of his day were the advocates of the rising
capitalist state, which Jefferson regarded with much disdain, clearly
recognising the quite obvious contradiction between democracy and
capitalism, or more accurately what we might call really existing
capitalism, that is, guided and subsidised by powerful developmental states,
as it was in England and the U.S. and indeed everywhere else.

<P>This fundamental contradiction is enhanced as new corporate structures were
granted increasing powers, not by democratic procedures but mainly by courts
and lawyers who converted what Jefferson called the "banking institutions
and monied incorporations," which he said would destroy freedom, and which
he could barely see the beginnings of in his day. They were converted,
mainly through courts and lawyers, into "immortal persons" with powers and
rights beyond the worst nightmares of pre-capitalist thinkers like Adam
Smith or Thomas Jefferson. Half a century earlier, Adam Smith already warned
against this, though he could barely see the beginnings of it.

<P>Jefferson's distinction between aristocrats and democrats was developed
about a half a century later by Bakunin, the anarchist thinker and activist,
actually one of the few predictions of the social sciences ever to have come
true. It ought to have a place of honour in any serious academic curriculum
in the social sciences and the humanities for this reason alone. Back in the
nineteenth century, Bakunin predicted that the rising intelligentsia of the
nineteenth century would follow one of two parallel paths. One path would be
to exploit popular struggles to take state power, becoming what he called a
"Red bureaucracy that will impose the most cruel and vicious regime in
history." That's one strain. The other strain, he said, will be those who
discover that real power lies elsewhere, and they will become its bought
priesthood, in the words of the labour press, serving the real masters in
the state-supported private system of power, either as managers or
apologists who beat the people with the people's stick, as he put it, in the
state capitalist democracies. The similarities are pretty striking, and they
run right up to the present. They help account for the rapid transitions
that people make from one to the other position. It looks like a funny
transition, but in fact it's a common ideology. We're seeing it right now in
Eastern Europe with the group that's sometimes called the Nomenklatura
capitalists, the old communist ruling class, now the biggest enthusiasts for
the market, enriching themselves as the societies become standard Third
World societies. The move is very easy, because it's basically the same
ideology. A similar move from Stalinist commissar to celebration of America
is quite standard in modern history, and it doesn't require much of a shift
in values, just a shift in judgment as to where power lies.

<P>Independently of Jefferson and Bakunin, others were coming to the same
understanding in the nineteenth century. One of the leading American
intellectuals was Charles Francis Adams, who in 1880 described the rise of
what is now called the "post-industrial society" by Daniel Bell and Robert
Reich and John Kenneth Galbraith and others. This is 1880, remember. A
society in which, Adams says, "the future is in the hands of our
universities, our schools, our specialists, our scientific men and our
writers and those who do the actual work of management in the ideological
and economic institutions." Nowadays they're called the "technocratic elite"
and the "action intellectuals" or the new class or some other similar term.
Adams, back in 1880, concluded that "the first object of thinking citizens,
therefore, should be not to keep one or another political party in power,
but to insist on order and submission to law." Meaning that the elites
should be permitted to function in what's called "technocratic isolation,"
by the World Bank -- I'm being a little anachronistic here, that's modern
lingo -- or, as the London Economist puts the idea today, "policy should be
insulated from politics." That's the case in free Poland, they assure their
readers, so they don't have to be concerned about the fact that people are
calling for something quite different in free elections. They can do what
they like in the elections, but since policy is insulated from politics and
technocratic insulation proceeds, it really doesn't matter. That's
democracy.

<P>A decade earlier, in 1870, Adams had warned -- they were worried then about
universal suffrage, people were fighting for the right to vote -- he warned
that universal suffrage would "bring the government of ignorance and vice,
with power in the hands of the European and especially Celtic proletariat on
the Atlantic coast," those horrible Irish people, "an African proletariat on
the shores of the Gulf and a Chinese proletariat on the Pacific." Adams
didn't foresee the sophisticated techniques that would be developed in the
twentieth century to ensure that policy remains insulated from politics as
the franchise was extended through popular struggle and to guarantee that
the general public would remain marginalised and disaffected, subdued by the
new spirit of the age and coming to see themselves not as free people who
have a right to dignity and independence but as atoms of consumption who
sell themselves on the labour market, at least when they're lucky.

<P>Adams was in fact expressing an old idea. Eighty years earlier Alexander
Hamilton had put it clearly. He said there was the idea that your people are
a great beast and that the real disease is democracy. That's Hamilton. These
ideas have become ever more entrenched in educated circles, as Jefferson's
fears and Bakunin's predictions were increasingly realised. The basic
attitudes coming into this century were expressed very clearly by Woodrow
Wilson's Secretary of State, Robert Lansing, attitudes that led to Wilson's
Red Scare, as it was called, which destroyed labour and independent thought
for a decade. Lansing warned of the danger of allowing the "ignorant and
incapable mass of humanity" to become "dominant in the earth," or even
influential, as he believed the Bolsheviks intended. That's the hysterical
and utterly erroneous reaction that's pretty standard among people who feel
that their power is threatened. Those concerns were articulated very clearly
by progressive intellectuals of the period, maybe the leading one being
Walter Lippman in his essays of democracy, mainly in the 1920s. Lippman was
also the dean of American journalism and one of the most distinguished
commentators on public affairs for many years.

<P>He advised that "the public must be put in its place so that the responsible
men may live free of the trampling and the roar of a bewildered herd."
Hamilton's beast. In a democracy, Lippman held, these "ignorant and
meddlesome outsiders" do have a "function." Their function is to be
"interested spectators of action" but not "participants." They are to lend
their weight periodically to some member of the leadership class, that's
called elections, and then they are supposed to return to their private
concerns. In fact, similar notions became part of mainstream academic theory
at about the same time.

<P>In the presidential address to the American Political Science Association in
1934 William Shepard argued that government should be in the hands of "an
aristocracy of intellect and power," while the "ignorant, the uninformed and
the anti-social elements" must not be permitted to control elections, as he
mistakenly believed they had done in the past. One of the founders of modern
political science, Harold Lasswell, one of the founders of the field of
communications, in fact, wrote in the Encyclopedia of Social Sciences in
1933 or 1934 that modern techniques of propaganda, which had been
impressively refined by Wilsonian liberals, provided the way to keep the
public in line. Lasswell described Wilson as "the great generalissimo on the
propaganda front." Wilson's World War I achievements in propaganda impressed
others, including Adolf Hitler. You can read about it in Mein Kampf. But
crucially they impressed the American business community. That led to a huge
expansion of the public relations industry which was dedicated to
controlling the public mind, as advocates used to put it in more honest
days, just as writing in the Encyclopedia of Social Sciences in 1934,
Lasswell described what he was talking about as propaganda. We don't use
that term. We're more sophisticated.

<P>As a political scientist, Lasswell advocated more sophisticated use of this
new technique of control of the general pubic that was provided by modern
propaganda. That would, he said, enable the intelligent men of the
community, the natural rulers, to overcome the threat of the great beast who
may undermine order because of, in Lasswell's terms, the ignorance and
superstition of the masses. We should not succumb to "democratic dogmatisms
about men being the best judges of their own interests." The best judges are
the elites, who must be ensured the means to impose their will for the
common good. Jefferson's aristocrats, in other words.

<P>Lippman and Lasswell represent the more liberal, progressive fringe of
opinion which grants the beast at least a spectator role. At the reactionary
end you get those who are mislabelled conservatives in contemporary
newspeak. So the Reaganite statist reactionaries thought that the public,
the beast, shouldn't even have the spectator role. That explains their
fascination with clandestine terror operations, which were not secret to
anybody except the American public, certainly not to their victims.
Clandestine terror operations were designed to leave the domestic population
ignorant. They also advocated absolutely unprecedented measures of
censorship and agitprop and other measures to ensure that the powerful and
interventionist state that they fostered would serve as a welfare state for
the rich and not troubled by the rabble. The huge increase in business
propaganda in recent years, the recent assault on the universities by
right-wing foundations, and other tendencies of the current period are other
manifestations of the same concerns. These concerns were awakened by what
liberal elites had called the "crisis of democracy," that developed in the
1960s, when previously marginalised and apathetic sectors of the population,
like women and young people and old people and working people and so on,
sought to enter the public arena, where they have no right to be, as all
right-thinking aristocrats understand.

<P>John Dewey was one of the relics of the Enlightenment classical liberal
tradition who opposed the rule of the wise, the onslaught of the
Jeffersonian aristocrats, whether they found their place on the reactionary
or the liberal part of this very narrow ideological spectrum. Dewey
understood clearly that "politics is the shadow cast on society by big
business," and as long as this is so, "attenuation of the shadow will not
change the substance." Meaning, reforms are of limited utility. Democracy
requires that the source of the shadow be removed not only because of its
domination of the political arena, but because the very institutions of
private power undermine democracy and freedom. Dewey was very explicit about
the antidemocratic power that he had in mind. To quote him: "Power today" --
this is the 1920s -- "resides in control of the means of production,
exchange, publicity, transportation and communication. Whoever owns them
rules the life of the country, even if democratic forms remain. Business for
private profit through private control of banking, land, industry reinforced
by command of the press, press agents and other means of publicity and
propaganda, that is the system of actual power, the source of coercion and
control, and until it's unravelled we can't talk seriously about democracy
and freedom." Education, he hoped, of the kind he was talking about, the
production of free human beings, would be one of the means of undermining
this absolutist monstrosity.

<P>In a free and democratic society, Dewey held, workers should be the masters
of their own industrial fate, not tools rented by employers. He agreed on
fundamental issues with the founders of classical liberalism and with the
democratic and libertarian sentiments that animated the popular working
class movements from the early Industrial Revolution, until they were
finally beaten down by a combination of violence and propaganda. In the
field of education, therefore, Dewey held that it is "illiberal and immoral"
to train children to work "not freely and intelligently, but for the sake of
the work earned," in which case their activity "is not free because not
freely participated in." Again the conception of classical liberalism and
the workers' movements. Therefore, Dewey held, industry must also change
"from a feudalistic to a democratic social order" based on control by
working people and free association, again, traditional anarchist ideals
with their source in classical liberalism and the Enlightenment.

<P>As the doctrinal system has narrowed under the assault of private power,
particularly in the past few decades, these fundamental libertarian values
and principles now sound exotic and extreme, perhaps even anti-American, to
borrow one of the terms of contemporary totalitarian thought in the West.
Given these changes, it's useful to remember that the kinds of ideas that
Dewey was expressing are as American as apple pie. They have origins in
straight American traditions, right in the mainstream. Not influenced by any
dangerous foreign ideologies. In a worthy tradition that's ritually lauded,
though it's commonly distorted and forgotten. And all of that is part of the
deterioration of functioning democracy in the current age, both at the
institutional and at the ideological level, in my opinion.

<P>Education is, of course, in part a matter of schools and colleges and the
formal information systems. That's true whether the goal of education is
education for freedom and democracy, as Dewey advocated, or education for
obedience and subordination and marginalization, as the dominant
institutions require. The University of Chicago sociologist James Coleman,
one of the main students of education and effects of experience on
children's lives, concludes from many studies that "the total effect of home
background is considerably greater than the total effect of school variables
in determining student achievement." Actually, about twice as powerful in
effect, he concludes from a lot of studies. So it's therefore important to
have a look at how social policy and the dominant culture are shaping these
factors, home influences and so on.

<P>That's a very interesting topic. The inquiry is much facilitated by UNICEF
study published a year ago called Child Neglect in Rich Nations, written by
a well-known American economist, Sylvia Ann Hewlett. She studies the
preceding fifteen years, the late 1970s up through the early 1990s, in the
rich nations. She's not talking about the Third World but about the rich
countries. She finds a sharp split between the Anglo-American societies on
the one hand and continental Europe and Japan on the other hand. The
Anglo-American model, spearheaded by the Reaganites and Thatcher, has been a
disaster for children and families, she says. The European model, in
contrast, has improved their situation considerably, from a starting point
that was already considerably higher, despite the fact that the European
societies lack the huge advantages of the Anglo-American societies. The U.S.
has unparalleled wealth and advantages, and while the United Kingdom,
Britain, has severely declined, particularly under Thatcher, it has the
economic advantage, at least, of being a U.S. client as well as being a
major oil exporter in the Thatcher years. That's something that makes the
economic failure of Thatcherism even more dramatic as authentic British
conservatives like Lord Ian Gilmour have shown.

<P>Hewlett describes the Anglo-American disaster for children and families as
attributable "to the ideological preference for free markets." Here she's
only half right, in my opinion. Reaganite conservatism opposed free markets.
It did advocate markets for the poor, but it went well beyond even its
statist predecessors in demanding and winning a very high level of public
subsidy and state protection for the rich. Whatever you choose to call this
guiding ideology, it's unfair to tarnish the good name of conservatism by
applying it to this particular form of violent and lawless and reactionary
statism. Call it what you like, but it's not conservatism. It's not the free
market.

<P>However, Hewlett is quite right in identifying the free market for the poor
as the source of the disaster for families and children. And there isn't
much doubt of the effects of what Hewlett calls the "anti-child and
anti-family spirit that's loose in these lands," in the Anglo-American lands,
most dramatically in the U.S., but also Britain. This "neglect-filled
Anglo-American model based on market discipline for the poor has largely
privatised child rearing while making it effectively impossible for most of
the population to rear children." That's been the combined goal and policy
of Reaganite conservatism and the Thatcherite analogue. The result is, of
course, a disaster for children and families.

<P>Continuing, Hewlett points out, "in the much more supportive European model,
social policy has strengthened rather than weakened support systems for
families and children." It's no secret, except of course as usual to readers
of the press. As far as I'm aware, this 1993 study, rather critically
relevant to our current concerns, has yet to be reviewed anywhere. It's not
been, say, featured in the New York Times, although the Times did devote
last Sunday's book review section largely to this topic, with sombre
forebodings about the fall of IQ, the decline of SAT scores and so on and
what might be causing it. Say, in the city of New York, where the social
policies that have been pursued and backed by the Times have driven about
forty percent of the children below the poverty level, so that they're
suffering malnutrition, disease and so on. But it turns out that is
irrelevant to the decline in IQ, as is anything that Hewlett discusses in
this Anglo-American neglect-filled model. What's relevant, it turns out, is
bad genes. Somehow people are getting bad genes, and then there are various
speculations about why this is. For example, maybe it's because black
mothers don't nurture their children, and the reason is maybe they evolved
in Africa where the climate was hostile. So those are maybe the reasons, and
this is really serious, hard-headed science, and a democratic society will
ignore all this at its peril, the reviewer says. Well-disciplined commissars
know well enough to steer away from the obvious factors, the ones rooted in
very plain and clear social policy. They are perfectly evident to anybody
with their head screwed on and happen to be discussed in considerable detail
by a well-known economist in a UNICEF study that's not likely to see the
light of day around here.

<P>The facts are no secret. A blue-ribbon commission of the state boards of
education and the American Medical Association reported, "Never before has
one generation of children been less healthy, less cared for, and less
prepared for life than their parents were at the same age." That's a big
shift in an industrial society. It's only in the Anglo-American societies
where this anti-child, anti-family spirit has reigned for fifteen years
under the guise of conservatism and family values. That's a real triumph for
propaganda. It's one that would very much have impressed even
"generalissimo" Woodrow Wilson, or probably Stalin and Hitler.

<P>A symbolic expression of this disaster is that when Hewlett wrote her book a
year ago, 146 countries had ratified the international convention on the
rights of the child, but one had not: the U.S. That's a standard pattern for
international conventions on human rights. However, just for fairness, it's
only proper to add that Reaganite conservatism is catholic in its
anti-child, anti-family spirit, so the World Health Organization voted to
condemn the Nestle Corporation for aggressive marketing of infant formula,
which kills plenty of children. The vote was 118 to 1. I'll leave you to
guess the one. However, this is quite minor compared with what the World
Health Organization calls the "silent genocide" that's killing millions of
children every year as a result of the freemarket policies for the poor and
the refusal of the rich to give any aid. Again, the U.S. has one of the
worst and most miserly records among the rich societies.

<P>Another symbolic expression of this disaster is a new line of greeting cards
by the Hallmark Corporation. One of them says, "Have a super day at school."
That one, they tell you, is to be put under a box of cereal in the morning,
so that when the children go off to school it says, Have a super day at
school. Another one says, "I wish I had more time to tuck you in." That's
one that you stick under the pillow at night when the kid goes to sleep
alone. [laughter] There are other such examples.

<P>In part this disaster for children and families is the result simply of
falling wages. State corporate policy has been designed for the last years,
especially under the Reaganites and Thatcher, to enrich small sectors and to
impoverish the majority, and it succeeded. It's had exactly the intended
effect. That means that people have to work much longer hours to survive.
For much of the population both parents have to work maybe fifty to sixty
hours merely to provide necessities. Meanwhile, incidentally, corporate
profits are zooming. Fortune magazine talks about the "dazzling" profits
reaching new heights for the Fortune 500 even though sales are stagnating.

<P>Another factor is job insecurity, what economists like to call "flexibility
in the labour markets," which is a good thing under the reigning academic
theology, but a pretty rotten thing for human beings, whose fate doesn't
enter into the calculations of sober thinking. Flexibility means you better
work extra hours or else. There are no contracts and no rights. That's
flexibility. We've got to get rid of market rigidities. Economists can
explain it. When both parents are working extra hours, and for most on
falling incomes, it doesn't take a great genius to predict the outcome. The
statistics show them. You can read them in Hewlett's UNICEF study if you
like. It's perfectly obvious without reading them what's going to happen.
Contact time, that is, actual time spent by parents with children, has
declined forty percent in the last twenty five years in the Anglo-American
societies, mostly in recently years. That's actually ten to twelve hours a
week of eliminating contact time and what they call "highquality time," time
when you're not just doing something else, is virtually disappearing. Of
course that leads to the destruction of family identity and values. It leads
to sharply increased reliance on television for child supervision. It leads
to what are called "latchkey children," kids who are alone, a factor in
rising child alcoholism and drug use and in criminal violence against
children by children and other obvious effects in health, education, ability
to participate in a democratic society, even survival, of course decline in
SATs and IQs, but you're not supposed to notice that. That's bad genes,
remember.

<P>None of these things are laws of nature. These are consciously selected
social policies designed for particular goals, namely enrich the Fortune 500
but impoverish others. In Europe, where conditions are more stringent but
policy is not guided by the same anti-family, anti-child spirit, the
tendencies are in the opposite direction and the standards for children and
families are much better.

<P>It's worth mentioning, and let me stress, that this is not just true in the
Anglo-American societies themselves. We're a big, powerful state. We have
influence. It's very striking to notice what happens when other countries
within the range of our influence try to undertake policies that benefit
families and children. There are two striking examples.

<P>The region that we control most completely is the Caribbean and Central
America. There are two countries there that did undertake such policies:
Cuba and Nicaragua, and with considerable success, in fact. Something which
should surprise no one is that those are the two countries that were
primarily targeted for U.S. assault. And it succeeded. So in Nicaragua, the
rising health standards and the improvement in literacy and the reduction in
child malnutrition have been reversed thanks to the terrorist war that we
fought in Nicaragua, and now it's proceeding to the level of Haiti. In the
case of Cuba, of course, the terrorist war has been going on a lot longer.
It was launched by John F. Kennedy. It had nothing to do with communism.
There weren't any Russians around. It had to do with things like the fact
that these people were devoting resources to the wrong sectors of the
population. They were improving health standards. They were concerned with
children, with malnutrition. Therefore we launched a huge terrorist war. A
bunch of CIA documents were just released recently filling in some of the
details of the Kennedy period, which was bad enough. It continues up to the
present. Actually, there was another assault just a couple of days ago. On
top of that there's an embargo to try to ensure that they'll really suffer.
For years the pretext was that this had to do with the Russians, which is
completely fraudulent, as you can see by what was going on when the policies
were instituted and as is demonstrated conclusively by what happened after
the Russians disappeared. Here was a real job for the bought priesthood.
They have to not notice that after the Russians disappeared we harshened the
attack against Cuba. Kind of odd if the reason for the attack was that they
were an outpost of communism and the Russian empire. But we can handle that.

<P>So after the Russians disappeared from the scene and it really became
possible to strangle them, the conditions got harsher. A proposal was sent
through Congress by a liberal Democrat, Representative Torricelli, calling
for a cutoff of any trade with Cuba by any subsidiary of any American
corporation or any foreign corporation that used any parts produced in the
U.S. That is so obvious in violation of international law that George Bush
vetoed it. However, he was forced to accept it when he was outflanked from
the right by the Clintonites in the last election, so he did then allow it
to go through. That went right to the United Nations, where the U.S.
position was denounced by just about everybody. In the final vote, the U.S.
could pick up only Israel, which is automatic, and they got Rumania for some
reason. Everyone else voted against it. The U.S. position was defended by no
one. It is an obvious violation of international law, as even Britain and
others pointed out. But it doesn't matter. It's extremely important to carry
out our anti-child, anti-family spirit and our insistence on highly
polarised societies everywhere we can go. If any foreign country under our
control tries to go that way, we'll take care of them, too. That's now
continuing. It's the kind of thing you can actually do something about if
you like. In Chicago there is the Pastors for Peace and the Chicago-Cuba
Coalition has another caravan going to Cuba to try to undermine the embargo
and bring humanitarian aid, medicines, medical books, powdered milk for
infants and other assistance. They're in the phone book under Chicago-Cuba
Coalition. You can look them up. Anyone who is interested in countering the
anti-child, anti-family spirit that reigns here and that we're exporting by
violence elsewhere can do that, just as they can do plenty of things at
home.

<P>I should say that the effects of this latest Democratic proposal, which went
through, to strangle Cuba, have recently been reviewed in this month's
issues, October, of two leading American medical journals, Neurology and the
Florida Journal of Medicine, which simply review the effects. They point out
the obvious thing. It turns out that about ninety percent of the trade that
was cut off by the Clinton-Torricelli bill was food and humanitarian aid,
food, medicine and things like that. For example, one Swedish company which
was trying to export a water filtration device to create vaccines was
blocked by the U.S. because there's some part in it that's American-made. We
really have to strangle them badly. We have to make sure that plenty of
children die. One effect is a very sharp rise in infant mortality and child
malnutrition. Another is a rare neurological disease that's spread over Cuba
that everyone pretended they didn't know the reasons for. But of course they
did, and now it's conceded. It's malnutrition, a disease which hasn't been
seen since Japanese prison camps in the Second World War. So we're
succeeding in that one. The anti-child, anti-family spirit is not just
directed against kids in New York, but much more broadly.

<P>I stress again that the difference in Europe -- it is different in Europe, and
there are reasons for it. One of the differences is the existence of a
strong trade union movement. That's one aspect of a more fundamental
difference, namely, the U.S. is a business-run society to quite an
unparalleled degree, and as a result the vile maxim of the masters prevails
to an unprecedented extent, pretty much as you'd expect. These are among the
means that allow democracy to function formally, although by now most of the
population is consumed by what the press calls "anti-politics," meaning
hatred of government, disdain for political parties and the whole democratic
process. That, too, is a great victory for the aristocrats in Jefferson's
sense, that is, those who fear and distrust the people and wish to draw all
power from them into the hands of the higher classes. By now that means into
the hands of transnational corporations and the states and
quasi-governmental institutions that serve their interests.

<P>Another victory is the fact that the disillusionment, which is rampant, is
anti-politics. A New York Times headline on this reads, "Anger and Cynicism
Well Up In Voters As Hope Gives Way. Mood Turns Ugly as More People Become
Disillusioned With Politics." Last Sunday's magazine section was devoted to
anti-politics. Notice: not devoted to opposition to power and authority, to
the easily identifiable forces that have their hands on the lever of
decision-making and that cast their shadow on society as politics, as Dewey
put it. They have to be invisible to the commissar class. The Times has a
story today again about this topic where they quote some uneducated person
who doesn't get the point. He says, "Yeah, Congress is rotten, but that's
because Congress is big business, so of course it's rotten." That's the
story you're not supposed to see. You're supposed to be anti-politics. The
reason is that whatever you think about government, it's the one part of the
system of institutions that you can participate in and modify and do
something about. By law and principle you can't do anything about investment
firms or transnational corporations. Therefore nobody better see that.
You've got to be anti-politics. That's another victory.

<P>Dewey's observation that politics is the shadow cast on society by big
business, which was incidentally also a truism to Adam Smith, has now become
invisible. The force that casts the shadow has been pretty much removed by
the ideological institutions and is so remote from consciousness that we're
left with anti-politics. That's another severe blow to democracy and a grand
gift to the absolutist and unaccountable systems of power that have reached
levels that a Thomas Jefferson or John Dewey could scarcely imagine.

<P>We have the usual choices. We can choose to be democrats in Thomas
Jefferson's sense. We can choose to be aristocrats. The latter path is the
easy one. That's the one that the institutions are designed to reward. It
can bring rich rewards given the locus of wealth and privilege and power and
the ends that they very naturally seek. The other path, the path of the
Jeffersonian democrats, is one of struggle, often defeat, but also rewards
of a kind that can't even be imagined by those who succumb to the new spirit
of the age, gain wealth, forgetting all but self. It's the same now as it
was 150 years ago when there was an attempt first to drive it into the heads
of the factory girls in Lowell and the craftsmen in Lawrence and so on.
Today's world is very far from Thomas Jefferson's. The choices it offers,
however, have not changed in any fundamental way.

<HEAD><TITLE>Clinton's Health Plan</TITLE>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">

<CENTER>
<H1>Chomsky on Clinton's Health Plan</H1>
<P>August 27, 1994

<P><TABLE WIDTH=66%><TR><TD>
<I>This is from Z magazine's ZBBS (now part of LBBS which is co-sponsored with the Nation and many many others; email a message to</I> <A HREF="mailto:lbbs-info@igc.apc.org">lbbs-info@igc.apc.org</A><I>). Chomsky was replying to a message by ZBBS/LBBS subscriber Charles Wilkins.</I>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Charles Wilkins:</B> I am wondering. Clinton is so lame, is he merely trying to offer something so pitiful that no one will support it, and health care will go away again?

<P>If he wanted a serious plan, surely by organizing the populace he could win one. Maybe not ideal. But a lot better than anything that has even been discussed, much less put on the docket.

<P>I wonder what you think, professor Chomsky...</FONT>

<P><B>Noam Chomsky:</B> In my opinion, Clinton's been trying to put through a health plan that will satisfy the demands of the huge insurance companies and will place them, and other huge organizations under business control, in a position to control the rising health costs that are becoming a serious burden for US-based corporate power. The actual plan he proposed might or might not be an improvement over the current system, but that's not the driving factor. If it were, he would have proposed a plan of the sort that has long been favored by a majority or substantial pluralities -- even though it is barely discussed in the mainstream: what is called here a "single payer plan," a cover term for some sort of tax-based system that guarantees health care. That is not in the cards, though there is quite compelling evidence that it would be far more efficient, would involve much less bureaucracy and needless cost, and even happens to be quite popular among the general population, though not the narrow sectors that matter. The only plans that are being seriously considered are radically regressive "soak the poor" plans that leave the huge insurance corporations in power, so the taxpayer will have to fund their massive profits, internal bureaucracies and inefficiencies, ludicrous executive salaries and perks, advertising, etc. -- while watching them work as best they can to reduce health care to the minimum (after all, they are not charities: their task is to make profit). A still better plan, not even being discussed, would change priorities radically to preventive care, overcoming social and infrastructure factors that cause disease and suffering, and so on.

<P>Clinton's attempt to steer through a program that meets his priorities has, not surprisingly, met difficulties from all sides. I agree with you that he could organize public support for a "serious plan," but that would not be acceptable to the power systems that he primarily serves -- though it is intriguing that the hopelessly inefficient semi-privatized system now operating has become so harmful to business interests that even "Business Week" came out in support (more or less) for a "single payer" plan.

<H1>Chomsky on Cuba</H1>
<P>August 27, 1994

<P><TABLE WIDTH=66%><TR><TD>
<I>This is from Z magazine's ZBBS (now part of LBBS which is co-sponsored with the Nation and many many others; email a message to </I> <A HREF="mailto:lbbs-info@igc.apc.org">lbbs-info@igc.apc.org</A><I>). Chomsky was replying to a message by ZBBS/LBBS subscriber Nancy Markham.</I>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Nancy Markham:</B> There have been some exchanges recently on the Internet -- between Amnesty International critics and Cuba supporters -- and on LBBS too, over in the foreign policy forum, about Cuba.

<P>What do you think is going on now. And what do you think is the best attitude for leftists in the U.S. to take to dissidents in Cuba, and U.S. Cuba policy?

<P>For that matter, what do you think of Cuba's revolution, Castro, etc.?

<P>I think there is a lot of confusion about these concerns among leftist and that things are only going to get more hectic and difficult. So I wonder if you would try to shed a little light...</FONT>

<P><B>Noam Chomsky:</B> The questions you raise are too broad, and too important, to be addressed in a letter. As to what I think is going on -- pretty much what has been going on in the past. I've outlined what I think in recent publications, for example, in a chapter of a book "Year 501" published last year. I also try to show there (and elsewhere) that US policies towards Cuba are part of a far more general pattern, quite intelligible in terms of domestic power structures, and amply illustrated in the historical and documentary record, though quite inconsistent with the fairy tales that are preferred by the commissar class (to use an unkind but generally accurate term).

<P>Very briefly, since the 1820s Cuba has been regarded by US elites as basically theirs, though they couldn't grasp the "ripe fruit" (as they put it then) until the British deterrent was removed. When it was, the US took the country over and turned it into a US plantation. No departure from obedience was tolerable. FDR's "good neighbor policy," for example, was shelved rapidly when it became necessary to reverse a deviation that threatened to allow some degree of independence and democracy. Within months of the success of the Castro revolution, Cuba was being bombed from US territory, and by March 1960 the US had secretly determined to overthrow the regime. This had nothing to do with Russia, Communism, dictatorship,... -- rather, with independence. There followed direct aggression, a huge terror campaign of unprecedented scale, economic warfare, and in fact, every possible means to get rid of this "rotten apple." Cuba was considered particularly dangerous because it sank so low as to direct resources to the benefit of the poor majority and, even worse, to support popular movements elsewhere that sought freedom from US-imposed or -backed monsters of one or another variety (what is called "subversion" or "aggression"). Another major crime was Cuba's contributions to health and welfare in poor and suffering countries, absolutely without precedent, and considered extremely dangerous, particularly in the light of the sordid record of those who have the wealth to confront and overcome those problems were they not to choose to exacerbate them -- us, in particular.

<P>For decades, the pretext for the terror and economic warfare was that Cuba was an outpost of the evil empire, threatening our security. When the evil empire collapsed, that excuse was quickly shelved, as useless, and forgotten, and the noose was tightened, again by the Bush administration (under pressure from liberal Democrats and the Clinton campaign), now again. These policies have long been in defiance of such trivialities as international law, world opinion (votes in the UN, including our allies), etc. In brief, a continuation of what has been going on for 170 years, and a particularly clear instance of far more general patterns, invisible only to those who make a real effort not to see.

<P>As for the regime, it's a dictatorship, often brutal though a teddy bear in comparison with numerous US friends and clients, with plenty of human rights violations, etc. The US hopes to increase these as much as possible, for obvious reasons: (1) that will increase internal disorder, and (2) it is ideologically useful as a weapon against the hated enemy. But it is trivial to demonstrate that Cuba's crimes, however you evaluate them, are irrelevant to US policy; the US happily supports and conducts itself far worse crimes, including its crimes against Cuba. Since the Russian collapse, the idea has been to tighten the stranglehold so as to impose maximal suffering and oppression, hence increased resistance and more repression and suffering, in the hope that sooner or later people will be desperate enough to welcome the Marines. Even loyal apologists generally concede what is obvious enough from the reporting that comes through: people are trying to get out because they are suffering from the collapsing economy. Naturally, no small country in the US sphere can survive such an attack by the superpower hegemon without extensive outside support, and there are few willing to brave the anger of the world's leading Mafia don.

<P>A crucial requirement is that articulate opinion in the US efface completely what is happening before our eyes, however obvious it is, even (at the most extreme levels of servility, regularly attained) to portray us as victims of Castro -- standard in mainstream commentary. That this requirement will be amply fulfilled is scarcely in doubt, so policy can continue on course.

<P>How should honest people react? First, with utter revulsion. Second, by doing what they can to allow Cubans to deal with their problems themselves, without our domination and control -- which, as history amply shows, will cause them endless pain and torture. Personally, I'd like to see the regime overthrown by an internal libertarian revolution (and not that one alone). But I don't expect the US to implement such initiatives any more than it does in the vast areas of the world in which it has enormous influence, including at home -- and if the US were to change so radically that that were a possibility, or if there were some other entity in the global system so noble that such possibilities could be contemplated without ridicule, I wouldn't want them to intervene either, nor would they choose to, if they had actually achieved this (unimaginable) level of honor. The reasons are those that have been familiar for centuries, articulated by Kant and other Enlightenment figures for example: freedom can only be won, not granted by a benevolent power. Those who are fighting for freedom can sometimes be helped, but only by those committed to freedom, that is, those who oppose terror, oppression, injustice, and domination honestly, beginning with the societies of which they are part (where they will find plenty).

<P>At this level of extreme generality, anything said is bound to be inadequate and misleading, but a really serious effort to deal with the issues would overwhelm this medium, I think.

<HEAD><TITLE>Chomsky - from The New Statesman</TITLE>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">

<CENTER>
<H2>Chomsky in <I>The New Statesman</I></H2>
<P>July, 1994
</CENTER>

<P>There's a conventional doctrine about the era that we are entering and the promise that it is supposed to afford. In brief, the story is that the good guys won the cold war shoot-out and they're firmly in the saddle. There may be some rough terrain ahead, but nothing that they can't handle. They ride off into the sunset, leading the way to a bright future, based on the ideals that they have always cherished but have not always been able to protect -- democracy and free markets and human rights...

<P>The reality, however, is very different. Power is increasingly concentrated in unaccountable institutions, and the rich and powerful are no more willing to submit themselves to market disciplines or popular pressures than they ever have been in the past. Let's begin with human rights, because they are the easiest place to start: they are actually codified in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, passed unanimously by the United Nations General Assembly in December 1948. In the United States, there has been a good deal of very impressive rhetoric about how we stand for the Universal Declaration, and how we defend the principle of universality against backward, third-world peoples who plead cultural relativism.

<P>But the rhetoric is rarely besmirched by any reference to what the Universal Declaration actually says.

<P>Article 25, for example, states: "Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well being of himself and his family" -- this is the terminology of 194 remember -- "including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to secure that in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood."

<P>How are these principles upheld in the richest country in the world, with absolutely unparalleled advantages and no excuses for not completely satisfying them? The US has the worst record on poverty in the industrialized world. Tens of millions of people are hungry every night, including millions of children who are suffering from third world levels of disease and malnutrition. In New York City, one of the richest cities in the world, 40 per cent of children live below the poverty line, deprived of minimal conditions that offer some hope for escape from misery, destitution and violence.

<P>This is, moreover, just one part of a general worldwide catastrophe. Unesco estimates that about 500,000 children die every year as a result of the debt repayment burden alone. Debt repayment means that commercial banks made bad loans to their favorite dictators, and those loans are now being paid by the poor, who of course had absolutely nothing to do with the process. Meanwhile, the World Health Organization estimates that 11 million children die every year from easily treatable diseases. The World Health Organization describes it as "a silent genocide": it could be stopped for pennies a day. And Unesco estimates that the human cost of what is called "economic reform" in Russia has been some 500,000 excess deaths a year since 1989. There are comparable figures for elsewhere in eastern Europe.

<P>Let's turn now to Article 23 of the Universal Declaration. It states: "Everyone has the right to work, to just and favorable conditions of work, and to protection against unemployment, with remuneration ensuring for himself and his family an existence worthy of human dignity, supplemented if necessary by other means of social protection." Furthermore, "everyone has the right to form and join trade unions, for protection of his interests."

<P>To take the last point first, in the US, technically, everyone has the right to join a trade union. But the reality is quite different. In 1992, the International Labor Organization, which rarely has an unkind word for its paymasters, called on the US to conform to international labor standards on "permanent replacement workers," which were then violated only by the US and South Africa in the industrial world. "Permanent replacement workers," otherwise known as scabs, are those brought in to replace sacked unionized workers to break strikes: international labor law condemns the practice, but it is condoned in the US. There was an article in <CITE>Business Week</CITE> last week describing some of the consequences of the American state's vicious anti-labor activities. Illegal firings for union organizing have gone up sixfold, it reckoned, in the past 25 years. In particular, thousands of union organizers have been illegally fired since the start of Ronald Reagan's presidency in 1981.

<P>According to the US Labor Department, the destruction of the unions as been the main factor in the decline of real wages that has continued since the Reagan era. Health and safety standards in the workplace have also deteriorated: there are laws, but they're simply not enforced, so the number of industrial accidents has risen sharply in the past ten years. Then there is the effect of the decline of unions on democracy: the unions are one of the few means by which ordinary people can enter the political arena. Finally, there's a psychological effect. The destruction of the unions is part of a much more general effort to privatize aspirations, to eliminate solidarity, the sense that we're all in it together, that we care for one another.

<P>Let's go back to Article 23 again: "Everyone has a right to work." The ILO has just published a report estimating the level of global unemployment in January 1994 at about 30 per cent. That, it says accurately, is a crisis worse than in the 1930s. Everywhere, there are idle hands, and everywhere there is work to be done, but the economic system is simply incapable of bringing them together.

<P>In the US, of course, there is currently a recovery. But it's remarkably sluggish, with less than a third of the job growth of previous six recoveries. Furthermore, of the jobs that are being created, an enormous proportion -- more than a quarter in 1992 -- are temporary jobs, and most are not in the productive part of the economy. Economists welcome this vast increase in temporary jobs as an "improvement in the flexibility of labor markets." No matter that it means that when you go to sleep at night you don't know if you're going to have work the next morning -- it's good for profits, which means that it's good for the economy.

<P>Another aspect of the recovery is that people are working longer for less money. The workload is continuing to increase, while wages are continuing to decline -- which is unprecedented for a recovery. US wages -- as measured by labor costs per unit output -- are now the lowest in the industrial world, except for Britain. Having been the highest in the world in 1985 (as one might expect in the world's richest country), US labor costs are today 60 per cent lower than Germany's and 20 per cent lower than Italy's. <CITE>The Wall Street Journal</CITE> called this turnaround "a welcome development of transcendent importance."

<P>It is fashionable to claim that all this is simply the effect of trade and automation, transmitted through "market forces," operating rather like natural laws. In fact, the state has played a decisive part in both trade and automation. Trade is massively subsidized, particularly through manipulation of energy costs for transport: a realistic assessment of the costs of trade would somehow have to include, for example, a proportion of the costs of maintaining the US military presence in the Middle East, a major purpose of which is to keep oil prices within a particular range. Not too low, because the oil companies need to make plenty of profit, but not too high because trade has to be "efficient."

<P>Similarly, for decades, automation has had to be developed in the state sector (meaning, in the US, the military sector). In the 1950s, for example, before computers were marketable, they were virtually 100 per cent supported by the taxpayer. The free enterprise system means that the public bears the cost, and if anything comes out of it, it's handed over to the corporations.

<P>This is not to say that the state can control market forces. Here, it is worth recalling, after Richard Nixon's death last month, his demolition in the early 1970s of the Bretton Woods system for regulating international currencies, in which the US served in effect as international banker. One effect of the deregulation of currencies was a huge increase of the size of capital and financial markets. And the amount of capital transferred daily is increasing. It's probably now about a trillion dollars a day -- again swamping governments.

<P>There has also been a radical change in the nature of currency transactions. According to John Eatwell, an economist at Cambridge University, before Nixon dismantled the system, about 90 per cent of international currency transactions were for long-term investment or trade and about 10 per cent for speculation. Now there's a vastly greater amount, and figures have reversed. It's 90 per cent for speculation, and about 10 per cent for investment and trade. And this appears to be a major factor in the decline of growth rates since the early 1970s. A study published in <CITE>The Wall Street Journal</CITE> a week or so ago estimated that about half the decline in growth rates is due to the speculative capital. Bond holders want money to be stable: they don't want growth because it might lead to inflation.

<P>The increase in speculative capital means that it is now difficult for a nation state -- even the US, the richest economy in the world -- to carry out even minimal economic planning. (For a third-world country, the position is hopeless.) And the new GATT agreements are designed to undercut the possibilities for planning even more, by extending so-called liberalization to what they call services -- meaning that big Japanese, British and American banks can displace the banks in smaller countries.

<P>While capital is now highly mobile, labor is increasingly immobile -- and that has immediate consequences. It means that it is easy to shift production to low-wage, high-repression areas of the world with low environmental standards. And it also makes it very easy to play off one immobile national labor force against another, as happened during the North American Free Trade Agreement debate in the US, for example, when the media carefully focused on the argument that NAFTA would mean jobs flowing from Mexico to the United States.

<P>On the other hand, there was another point that just about everybody agreed on across the board; that the effect of NAFTA would be to cut wages in the United States for unskilled workers (a technical term that means about 70 or 75 per cent of the workforce). The agreement is expected to have the same effect in Canada and could well cut wages in Mexico, although for different reasons. To cut wages, you don't have to move manufacturing, you just have to be able to threaten to do it. The threat alone is enough to lower wages and increase temporary employment.

<P>The shift from national economies to a single global economy also has the effect of undermining functioning democracy. The mechanisms are pretty obvious. Power is shifting into the hands of huge transnational corporations and away from parliamentary institutions. Meanwhile, there's a structure of governance that's coalescing around these transnational corporations.

<P>A couple of years back, the <CITE>Financial Times</CITE> described this as "a de facto world government," including the World Bank and the IMF, GATT, the World Trade Organization, the G7 Executive, and so on. This has the very useful property that it removes power from parliamentary institutions, which are considered dangerous, naturally, because they might fall, at least partially, under the influence of the rabble.

<P><CITE>The Economist</CITE> recently described how important it is to keep policy "insulated from politics." If the policy is insulated from politics, you can have democratic forms, certain that they're not going to harm anything. The insulated technocrats can work for the health of the economy in the technical sense of that term, meaning low growth and low wages -- but high profits for that small section of the world's population that already enjoys extreme wealth and privilege.

<H1>A Phone Call to Noam Chomsky</H1>
<P>A PeaceWORKS Exclusive<BR>
By Michael Slaughter

<P><TABLE WIDTH=66%><TR><TD>
<I>The following interview, a PeaceWORKS exclusive, was conducted with Professor Chomsky via telephone on May 9. PeaceWORKS is published monthly by the Peninsula Peace and Justice Center, P.O. Box 1725, Palo Alto, CA  94302.</I>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>PeaceWORKS:</B> Dr. Chomsky, why do you call yourself a "libertarian anarchist" rather than a plain "anarchist"?</FONT>

<P><B>Noam Chomsky:</B> The term I usually use is "libertarian socialist," which is fairly standard usage in the anarchist tradition. Anarchism covers a pretty broad range. One major sector in Europe regarded itself as the libertarian wing of the socialist movement. Unfortunately, the term "libertarian" has a different usage in the United States, which departs from the tradition. Here the term "libertarian" means anarcho- capitalist.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>PeaceWORKS:</B> Would you say anarchism generally is a tendency to increase freedom, as one might look at a decrease of entropy as a sign of life?</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> My feeling about anarchism is that it is not a movement with an ideology. It is a tendency in the history of human thought and action which seeks to identify coercive, authoritarian, and hierarchic structures of all kinds and to challenge their legitimacy -- and if they cannot justify their legitimacy, which is quite commonly the case, to work to undermine them and expand the scope of freedom. I don't think there are formulas that can be applied.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>PeaceWORKS:</B> In that regard, that's what I call "Chomsky's Laser," like Occam's Razor: that all authority must justify itself.</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> The burden of proof is really on the authoritarian structures. That's the essential meaning of anarchist thought. That is not to say that some structures can't stand the examination.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>PeaceWORKS:</B> Sure, you use the example of a 3-year-old child running out into the street ... You say that "people should tear away the masks of ideological distortion and indoctrination" ... Maybe it's Hume's Paradox: people have to give their consent to be ruled. But if they just withhold consent, saying, "you haven't convinced me," does that mean that the power structure goes away?</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Well, if you just withhold consent privately at home, nothing happens. If withholding consent is a step toward organization and action, then a lot can change. In fact, you can claim that you are withholding consent and still be consenting to the structure. For example, suppose that you're living in a society that has slavery. If you sit at home quietly and say, "I object to slavery," that's giving your consent.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>PeaceWORKS:</B>With regard to the individual, you have said that "in a society of clones, I would want to commit suicide." And yet "the genius of our democracy," as you put it, is that it isolates people. Isn't this society creating a society of clones?</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Not clones. Clones would be individuals who are literally identical. What the society is creating is a society of people who may be quite diverse, but are separated, so that they are not enriching each others by interaction by virtue of the diversity. This is a technique for creating passive consent. If you're really alone, it doesn't matter a lot what you think. You're giving consent. You may be as diverse as you like, but that diversity is contributing noting to the enrichment of oneself or others.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>PeaceWORKS:</B> In that regard, since the isolated individual can believe anything and it doesn't matter, yet you've also said that one must struggle against the state propaganda machine as an individual. Isn't that paradoxical?</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> It's not a paradox. A society of cooperating people is made up of thinking individuals. You clarify your thoughts by interactions with others. Typically, effective action is communal.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>PeaceWORKS:</B> You seem to be very sanguine about the use of computers, at least insofar as one's ability to communicate with others. Otherwise, aren't computers in fact simply another way of isolating the individual?</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Computers are like a lot of technology. They are rather neutral. They can be used for various purposes. Whether they are used to isolate people or bring them together depends upon the broader structure. They can be used to isolate people, but they can also bring people to interact. The technology doesn't really care much how it is used or about the social conditions under which it is used.

<P>There are some technologies that are destructive, but by and large they are multifaceted. Take automation. The way automation is being used is to impose a managerial hierarchy and eliminate meaningful work and even work altogether, but that's not inherent in the technology. The technology could just as well be used to empower workers, to increase satisfaction and personal compensation.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>PeaceWORKS:</B> This may be a bit self-reflexive ... you said that one cannot challenge the conventional wisdom between commercials or in 700 words on the Op Ed page. What is one constrained to do, then, in conversation?</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> It depends on the nature of the conversation. If it's a fleeting conversation, then you don't have the conditions to exchange thoughts. On the other hand, it can be meaningful. That is not to say you talk to a person for three hours in a row. I have running conversations with people that pick up every few years. They can be quite intense and very good.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>PeaceWORKS:</B> You have written, "We should try to create communities of understanding and cooperative work that are solid and substantial enough to resist, or simply ignore, the efforts to undermine rational discourse." Cannot the individual ignore the propaganda outpourings of the culture by turning off the TV and the radio and not reading the corporate press?</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Again we're back to consent. That's a form of consent. 

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>PeaceWORKS:</B> You say we have the freest society on earth, speaking of the United States, yet you write about the efficacy of U.S. propaganda, saying in effect that no commissar could hope for better results. Is that really free, or is this an illusion of freedom?</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> It's free in the sense that I described. The state, by comparative standards, has relatively little power to coerce. For example, the government can't terminate this phone conversation. It's not within state power. There are many similar restrictions. Societies differ. We happen to be probably on the freer end of that particular dimension, but there are many other dimensions.

<P>What's interesting about the United States from this point of view is how a substantial degree of freedom is obviated to a high degree by indoctrination. Take Animal Farm, which we all read, correctly, as a satirical condemnation of Soviet tyranny.

<P>The first edition of it, which appeared, I believe, in the early 40s, had an introduction by Orwell about England in which he talked about thought control in England. He said there were two major devices: one is just straight coercive, resulting from ownership of the press by wealthy men, who will allow only certain things to appear. The other is much more interesting, and that is that our entire educational system trains privileged people to understand that there are certain kinds of things you don't say. This is a form of socialization carried out by the educational system.

<P>He knew what he was talking about. There are some things you just don't say, and if you don't understand that, you're excluded. He said that the end result of these two factors is very effective. That introduction to Animal Farm disappeared. It was published separately 30 years later ... which kind of supports his point.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>PeaceWORKS:</B> Right! You always say that if you assume the worst, you guarantee that it will happen, versus admitting the possibility of change. Yet, you also say that when you started speaking in people's living rooms 25- 30 years ago, you thought the situation was hopeless, that the jingoist fanaticism would conquer all. Weren't you assuming that the worst would happen in that case?</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> That's not quite what I mean by assuming the worst. If you assume that there is nothing that can be done, then you guarantee that the worst will happen. If you take whatever small probability that there may be that something can be done, you at least offer a chance of influencing the outcome.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>PeaceWORKS:</B>Doesn't the foreign policy stuff you deal with sometimes seem, well, surreal?</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Sometimes it does. Clinton had ordered the bombing of Baghdad in retaliation for an alleged attempt to assassinate George Bush two months earlier. One of the justifications given by William Safire was, "Look, if we were to discover that Castro were responsible for the assassination of Kennedy, then we would have destroyed Havana."

<P>It's an interesting analogy, because the actual situation was the reverse -- as Safire and his readers know -- that the Kennedy Administration was trying to assassinate Castro. There were eight acknowledged assassination attempts. That should count as surreal.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>PeaceWORKS:</B> I am reminded of the line of the Mexican diplomat who said that it was too dangerous for them to announce that Cuba was a threat to Mexico, because forty million Mexicans would die laughing.</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> That was when the Kennedy Administration was trying to present Cuba as a threat. The Mexican diplomat was quite right. Forty million people would die laughing there - but not in the United States.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>PeaceWORKS:</B> Ultranationalism in the Third World, you say, is a threat because it's disobedient. Are there other kinds of threats from the Third World?</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Any effort to break out of the service role is considered unacceptable. It's given various names. Sometimes it's called radical nationalism or economic nationalism. Liberation theology is another form.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>PeaceWORKS:</B> You have said that now is a time for action.</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> It's always a time for action.

<P>With Jimmer Endres and Jon Slenk
<BR>March 9, 1994

<P><TABLE WIDTH=66%><TR><TD>
<I>This interview was recorded at the studios of WRCT Pittsburgh on the morning of March 9, 1994. This transcription appeared in the March 23 issue of the <CITE>Student Union</CITE> (Carnegie Mellon University). This interview was broadcast on "Eyes Wide Open" (WRCT Pittsburgh) on March 15 and 22. Noam Chomsky and WRCT Pittsburgh release this document into the public domain. You may copy and distribute it on a not-for-profit basis provided that this notice remains.</I>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>

<P>Welcome to "Eyes Wide Open." Today we have a very special guest, who in a reversal of the clich&#233;, does unfortunately need an introduction. Noam Chomsky is Institute Professor of Linguistics and Philosophy at MIT, where he has revolutionized linguistics twice since the late fifties. Besides that career, Chomsky -- in his spare time -- is a leading critic of US foreign policy and its servants in the domestic media. He produces ten or twenty articles and, typically, two or three books a year on the topic.

<P>Outside of the United States, Chomsky is well known, and his analysis of US foreign policy is widely heard and widely respected. Here at home, the institutions that come under his scrutiny, by and large, choose to answer his criticism by studiously ignoring him. Hence the necessity of this introduction.

<P>Chomsky is a regular contributor to <CITE><A HREF="http://www.lbbs.org/zmag/index.htm">Z Magazine</A></CITE> and <CITE>Lies Of Our Times,</CITE> and his recent books include: <CITE>Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media</CITE> (with Edward S. Herman) [Pantheon, 1988], <CITE><A HREF="../dd/dd.html">Deterring Democracy</A></CITE> [Verso, 1991], and <CITE><A HREF="../year/year.html">Year 501: The Conquest Continues</A></CITE> [<A HREF="http://www.lbbs.org/sep/sep.htm">South End Press</A>, 1993].

<P>We spoke by phone with Noam Chomsky at his home in Lexington, Massachusetts, on the morning of March 9, 1994.

<P><HR WIDTH=66%>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Jon Slenk:</B> Edward S. Herman and you have formulated an interesting  propaganda model which we'd be interested in finding out more  about. First of all, could you just give a thumbnail sketch of  this model?</FONT>

<P><B>Noam Chomsky:</B> The propaganda model, in my view, is kind of a truism. It says that you'd expect institutions to work in their own interests, and that they wouldn't function for long otherwise. If you take a look at the structure of the American media, there's various layers and components -- the <CITE>National Enquirer</CITE> that you pick up at the supermarket is not the same as the <CITE>Washington Post</CITE> -- but the basic structure with regard to the information part of it, not just the entertainment part, is that there are what are sometimes called "agenda-setting media": a number of major media outlets -- the <CITE>Washington Post,</CITE> the <CITE>New York Times,</CITE> the newsweeklies, CBS news, and so on -- there's a small number of those. They have the essential resources, they set the framework. Other, smaller media scattered around the country basically take their framework and adapt it, because if the newspapers in, say, Pittsburgh want to know about Somalia, very few of them are going to be able to send out their own correspondents.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Slenk:</B> So, for example, the AP news wire.</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Yeah, AP news is another one, right. They basically set the structure of the thing. If you take a look at these agenda-setting institutions, they are big corporations -- in fact mega-corporations. They're linked into even bigger conglomerates for the most part; they're also highly profitable. They, like other corporations, have a product and a market. The market is other businesses. So the economic structure of a newspaper is that it sells readers to advertisers.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Jimmer Endres:</B> In other words, they're not trying to sell newspapers to  people.</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> No. Very often a journal, if it's in financial trouble, will try to cut down its circulation. And in fact what they'll often try to do is up-scale their circulation because that increases their advertising rates. In effect, what they're doing is selling audiences to advertisers. For the agenda-setting media -- say the <CITE>New York Times,</CITE> the <CITE>Washington Post,</CITE> the <CITE>Wall Street Journal,</CITE> those -- they're actually selling very privileged audiences to other businesses. The readers of those journals are in the political class and the decision-making class, overwhelmingly. Suppose you're an intelligent Martian looking at this system. What you see is <I>big</I> corporations selling relatively privileged audiences in the decision-making classes to other businesses. Now you ask the question, What picture of the world do you expect to come out of this? A plausible answer: one that reflects the perspectives and interests and tastes and so on of the sellers, the buyers, and the market. It would be pretty surprising if that weren't the case.

<P>I don't call this even a theory; it's virtually an observation. And the big job is to see if that's true. The next thing is to try to test the conclusions, that are natural, and would be surprising if they weren't true, and see if they in fact are confirmed. And they're just confirmed to an overwhelming extent. These predictions have been tested -- I mean, this isn't physics, but by the standards of the social sciences, it's very hard to think of anything that's been that well-confirmed.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Endres:</B> Why don't we do that now? Why don't we apply this model  to some current stories?</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> I should say that the <I>real test</I> -- although I'm happy to do that, I think that that's just what we ought to do -- let me just make it clear that if you really want to test the model, you don't just look at a particular story. What you have to try to do is to show <I>systematic</I> behavior. If you take a look at our joint book [<CITE>Manufacturing Consent</CITE>], it tries to find parallel cases where power interests in the United States would want them to be interpreted differently, and then asks whether in fact the media system does interpret them differently.

<P>That's a long task. The first chapter of the book looks at human rights violations in enemy countries and in our own domains, and shows just a <I>radically</I> different treatment of them. That's systematic study. But let's look at particular cases, that's fine.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Endres:</B> How is the American media treating Bosnia? What I've  noticed is that there's a focus on atrocities, and misery; you  see black and white photo essays in <CITE>Time,</CITE> showing people  suffering, and there's this kind of dramatic soap-opera quality  to it. The only motive that I can imagine is to get people  upset, and terrified, and to have them say "we ought to do  something," and to prepare us for war, really.</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> In the case of Bosnia, here a comparative analysis <I>is</I> to the point. Instead of just asking, How are they covering Bosnia, let's ask how they're covering <I>parallel atrocities</I> in different places. There are some. For example, what's happening in Angola is comparable, probably worse than what's going on in Bosnia. There are the same UN observers in both places; they say Angola is <I>worse.</I> In Sarajevo, for example, I think about 9,000 people have been killed in the last couple of years. But in one town in Angola, Cu&#237;to, which has been under bombardment for years, about 25,000 have been killed. And the atrocities seem a good bit worse.

<P>Now, there's a comparison: two events taking place in the world, let's say comparable, though in fact Angola's probably worse. We can take a look at the coverage. And it's striking that you would naturally ask about Bosnia and not about Angola. There has been no coverage of Angola, essentially. Occasionally, you'll find a little thing. Actually I think I've clipped just about everything I've found. And there's <I>some</I>; if you're really looking, you can find it out. So for example what I just told you was in the press, but you really had to search. The British press covers it more closely.

<P>So why this great disparity? Well, that's an interesting question. Now we have a question to ask.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Endres:</B> Besides the obvious, there might be sort of a racist  element to the disparity there.</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Partly, it's racist, but I think it's more. What happens in the Balkans poses threats and dangers to rich, privileged people -- to the wealthy countries in Europe, to the United States itself, and so on. Hundreds of thousands of refugees have fled to Germany. The thing could extend to central Europe. Now, these are serious problems that the Europeans and the United States are worried about. On the other hand, if people slaughter each other in Angola, you know, it doesn't harm us, so we don't care, so let 'em do it. Furthermore, there's another factor. In the case of the Balkans, it's easy to focus the blame -- Serb peasants, who are probably communists anyway. Obvious bad guys. In the case of Angola, it's a little trickier. The major blame lies on a man who the United States was hailing as one of the great heroes of the twentieth century and one of the greatest freedom fighters, and pouring aid and military aid on him; every time he came to the United States he was hailed as a great hero.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Endres:</B> This is sounding like a broken record.</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> And probably, he's <I>still</I> getting aid from South Africa, and possibly even the United States through Zaire, our ally.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Endres:</B> What's his name?</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Jonas Savimbi. If you go back ten years, he was showing up at the big conservative fund-raising rallies, and Jeane Kirkpatrick was talking about him as one of the great heroes of our time, and so on and so forth. He was the recipient of enormous US aid through South Africa and Zaire, to try to keep that war going. We were one of the very few governments, maybe the only government, not to recognize the government of Angola and in fact to be fighting a war to overthrow it.

<P>Well, okay, there was an election, and he lost. By a lot. And then he went to war right away. And that's torn the country to shreds. And that's just not a good story. On the other hand, if you can be very pious about the atrocities committed by the miserable Serb peasants, well, that's a lot easier.

<P>So those are differences. And the race difference is also there. You're right about that.

<P>Now, there we have a comparison. And that tells us something about the media.

<P>It's not the only case, incidentally. Like Burundi, for example. Just yesterday a missionary reported a couple hundred people killed, and in <I>one week</I> a few months ago, one <I>week,</I> there were something like a hundred or two hundred thousand people killed.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Endres:</B> What! In Burundi? This is recently?</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Yeah, it was within the last few months. I didn't see it reported in the United States, but it was all over the British press.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Endres:</B> That's unbelievable!</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Well, no, I'm afraid not. It's just not a concern to US interests, so the media don't care. That's the number of people who have been killed in <I>all</I> the fighting in the Balkans. And that was about one week. The United States has no particular interests there one way or another.

<P>This isn't the first time, incidentally. Ed Herman and I wrote a book back in 1979 on these questions [Noam Chomsky and Edward S. Herman, <CITE>The Political Economy of Human Rights,</CITE> vol. I (<CITE>The Washington Connection and Third World Fascism</CITE>) and vol. II (<CITE>After the Cataclysm: Postwar Indochina and the Reconstruction of Imperial Ideology</CITE>). South End Press, 1979]. We didn't call it the "propaganda model," but it was the same story: looking at comparative reporting. We distinguished three kinds of atrocities: what we called "benign atrocities," "nefarious atrocities," and "constructive atrocities."

<P>Constructive atrocities are the ones we like. So they get very favorable coverage. When the present government of Indonesia came into power in 1965, the first thing it did was massacre about 750,000 people within four months. And that was reported. It was reported with great euphoria; it was one of the greatest things that ever happened. Actually in a recent book of mine, <CITE><A HREF="../year/year.html">Year 501</A>,</CITE> I have a chapter in which I just run through the press coverage of that. They were delighted. <CITE>Time</CITE> magazine was talking about the "boiling bloodbath" which is killing hundreds of thousands of people, and talking about how great it is, and so on and so forth. That was a constructive atrocity.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Endres:</B> In what terms could you frame a "boiling bloodbath" as  something constructive?</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Oh, you know, they were killing communists. Meaning landless peasants. They were killing landless peasants, mostly, and they were in fact destroying the only mass political party in the country, namely the Communist Party. And this was '65, so this was offered as a justification for our war in Vietnam. The idea was that because we were holding strong in Vietnam, we encouraged the Indonesian generals to carry out the "necessary task" of "cleansing their society" by massacring hundreds of thousands of people.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Endres:</B> I can't help but laugh, but it's not funny.</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> No, it's not funny. <A HREF="../year/year-c05-s01.html">Take a look at that chapter.</A> You can barely believe it. The <CITE>New York Times</CITE> was talking about "a gleam of light in Asia", "hope where there once was none." So that's a constructive bloodbath. It's great; we love it, we applaud it.

<P>A nefarious bloodbath is one that's committed by some enemy, say Pol Pot. And there, we started beating our breasts, and "How can human beings be so horrible?" and "Oh, God, what's the world coming to?" and the usual stuff. That's a nefarious bloodbath.

<P>And then a benign bloodbath is one where we just don't care one way or another.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Endres:</B> Angola or Burundi.</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Actually, we gave the example of Burundi. This was 1979, and there had just been a huge massacre there in which a couple hundred thousand people were killed, and it also wasn't covered. That was a benign bloodbath.

<P>The same is true here, today, in that categorization: Bosnia is a nefarious bloodbath -- you know, we can focus the blame on the bad guys, and besides, we care about it because the interests of rich white people could be harmed. Burundi is a benign bloodbath; we don't care one way or another. And Angola, it doesn't fit nicely. It's kind of semi-constructive, it's our guy doing it, probably still supported by us, for all I know.

<P>So those are differences, and those are systematic differences. We had two full volumes of material on that in '79 and a lot more in the later book. Bosnia is a case in point. Now, if you take a look at the actual coverage, in my opinion it's better than the norm. And the reason is that the United States has no specific interest. We've essentially ceded control over that one to Europe. However, there are some things which are really not being reported as they should be, in my opinion.

<P>The question of justice in Bosnia by this point, you can forget about it -- nobody cares, and they're not going to do anything about it. The only question is how can you dampen down the conflict so that the least damage is done to people.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Endres:</B> Are <I>those</I> questions being addressed?</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Well, there are some interesting and important issues, which are not being discussed, and ought to be, because they're things Americans ought to be thinking about. They have to do with American society.

<P>What's really needed there, as the UN commanders are saying constantly, is more ground troops. The only thing that can <I>sort of</I> quiet things down, a little bit, is ground troops, who can separate warring elements, be a buffer, provide some humanitarian aid, and so forth. They haven't done a perfect job by any means, but it's been a basically constructive job.

<P>Well, there's one country that won't send ground troops. Namely, us. We'll bomb. You know, the United States is happy to bomb. But they'll send no ground troops.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Endres:</B> For the obvious reasons.</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Actually, the reason is something that is not discussed, and ought to be discussed. The United States is <I>disqualified</I> from any participation in anything of a humanitarian nature. The reason is very simple. We have a unique military doctrine. I know of no other country that has it. It is US military doctrine that US military forces are not allowed to be placed under any threat. Other countries aren't like that. The rules of engagement for the Canadian and French and Indian and other forces in Bosnia are very tight. They can be under mortar attack and they don't shoot back. On the other hand, with US forces, look at Somalia. If some teenager looks at you the wrong way, you send in the helicopter gunships. Because our forces are not allowed to be under any threat. Now that disqualifies the US from participation in anything that involves civilians -- any sort of civil conflict, anything with civilian elements -- because we just use massive force to get rid of anybody we don't like. And that goes right back to the days of Indian fighting. This is a deeply rooted US business. We use massive force to destroy, and we have to be free from any attack. I think you can find the explanation for it in American history. The United States has never been under attack, since the War of 1812. We just attack others. And we're overwhelmingly powerful most of the time, so we just wipe 'em out.

<P>These are reasons that it makes sense for the US not to send forces; it would be a disaster.

<P>But these are things that ought to be discussed. Why is it that we are off the world spectrum on this? That's something that we ought to be thinking about.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Endres:</B> Well, being off the world spectrum, I don't think that  these questions are going to be raised.</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Well, here you see the real -- I wouldn't call it a <I>defect,</I> it's just so obvious -- but a <I>property</I> of the media system, the whole information system. Things that are very unpleasant about the United States are not going to be discussed. And that's very pertinent at this point, because exactly what is needed there is ground forces. Not bombers.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Endres:</B> Let's talk a little bit about the US now. A phrase that  pops up in your writing a lot, especially when you're talking  about this propaganda model, is "the doctrinal system." What  exactly do you mean by that phrase, "the doctrinal system"?</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Every country's got one. It's the system that filters outside reality -- the world, domestic society, what's happening, history -- and presents it to the public. It includes schools, universities, journals of opinion, mass media, that whole range of systems. That's the doctrinal system.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Endres:</B> And how does it work in this country, as opposed to other  places? In particular, I'm interested in hearing what you think  of the educational system, both public schools and universities.</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Well, actually, American universities -- I've spent a lot of time in universities around the world, and I think American universities are the best in the world. But that's not to say they're wonderful; there's a lot of problems with them. There's a good reason why there's a flow of, say, graduate students here, much more than from here. We also have a mass higher education system, which is rare. And it sort of functions, by comparative standards; it's not great, again, but by comparative standards, it functions quite well. Certainly far better than, say, continental Europe.

<P>On the other hand, if you look at the way the world is presented through our doctrinal system, it is <I>profoundly</I> distorted. Let's take one thing that's changed, because this is interesting. The original sin of American society is the extermination of the native population. That's not very pretty. There were maybe eight or ten million native Americans here, at a level of civilization that was not very different from the colonists, in many respects -- stone houses, advanced agriculture, organized societies, constitutional systems, lots of things.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Endres:</B> In fact, the Founding Fathers acknowledged this, although  that has been buried.</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Oh, yeah. Even as late as the late nineteenth century, when you read, say, Henry Adams' history of the Jeffersonian period, he starts off by talking about the "invasion of America." And, you know, they knew what was going on.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Endres:</B> You don't hear that today.</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> No. Now, you ask, How was this incident dealt with? That's kind of like asking, How do the Germans deal with the Holocaust? Well, for hundreds of years, it was totally falsified. I remember my own schooling, but when my daughter went to school, and she was a fourth grader in 1969, right after the My Lai massacre I was looking through one of her textbooks, fourth grade textbooks. And there happened to be a discussion of the Pequot massacre; it happened in 1640, right around here. And it was <I>praised,</I> as a magnificent thing. It was being described through the eyes of some kid, and he says I wish I were a man and had been there, you know, that sort of thing.

<P>I mean, this was a <I>brutal</I> massacre, in which the colonists waited until the men had left the village, and then went in and just murdered all the women and children, hoping that would intimidate the Pequots enough so that they would flee, which they did. And that was being praised.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Endres:</B> I grew up in Northeastern Ohio, the Great Lakes area,  where I was taught to think that it was a good thing that we used  germ warfare -- infected blankets -- to kill the Pontiacs and those  people.</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Really? Well, I grew up the same way. When I was a kid, we played Cowboys and Indians. We were the Cowboys and we killed the Indians. This is as if they played Aryans and Jews in Germany, you know, where the Aryans go out and kill the Jews. This went on in our country -- I don't know when you went to school -- but I think into the 1970s, at least.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Endres:</B> I was in fourth grade in 1979, I guess.</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Yeah, so into the 1980s this was going on -- just <I>fantastic.</I> Well, it's changed, finally. Which is interesting. The change started in the sixties, with all the movements and the ferment. They had a big civilizing effect on the country. It was slow to come; International Women's Day yesterday is another example of it. That's on the agenda because of the sixties movements. By now, I'm pretty sure, if you look at the elementary schools you're not going to find that stuff, in most places at least. What you find isn't going to be all that great, but it won't be that, at least. It won't be celebration of slaughter.

<P>Well, those are changes: very slow, it's hundreds of years -- and <I>shameful</I>; we ought to think about it. But that's an example of how things <I>can</I> change, and sometimes even do. And it's kind of interesting to see that this change has caused extreme frenzy. The whole hysteria about Political Correctness is largely a reaction to the fact that the country's getting more civilized. And there are a lot of people who are terrified of it. They want the good old days, you know, when you smashed people in the face, and we were great and everybody else was rotten and you kick 'em if you don't like 'em. And the fact that a lot of young people don't like that any more is driving elite groups to absolute frenzies. It's an interesting campaign, this PC thing.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Endres:</B> How does this work? It's interesting that our system,  unlike in Asia and to a lesser extent Europe, there is no  Ministry of Education. Everything is nominally local and  community-based. How does this kind of orthodoxy continue?</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> That's an interesting question. We have a very uniform ideological system, and pretty narrow. And how it works is quite interesting. This ought to be the major topic of study, actually, for cultural studies in the United States. We study how propaganda works in other countries, say, Russia or something; that's not very interesting, because it's transparent. The way it works here is very interesting. We have a very free society, maybe the freest in the world, in the sense that the government doesn't have a lot of capacity to intervene to control things, as compared with other countries. Much less than in England and Canada, say. On the other hand, it's very doctrinaire, very uniform; it's deeply fundamentalist. We're sort of like Iran -- that's no joke, actually -- if you look at us on cross-cultural studies. In fact, there was an article in the <CITE>Christian Science Monitor</CITE> yesterday, criticizing the media because they don't reflect the religious sentiments of Americans. And they give some figures, which are probably accurate. The United States is just way off the spectrum of Western countries in this regard. We're deeply fundamentalist, very doctrinaire; the elite intellectual culture is extremely narrow, even by our own standards. I just gave a talk last night on "Prospects for Democracy" and one of the things I did was to just take a look at how the question of how democracy was understood from Thomas Jefferson right up through the early part of the twentieth century -- people like John Dewey -- and compare the way it's looked at now. And it's quite interesting. Thomas Jefferson, for example, was bitterly opposed to corporations, and banking institutions, which barely existed in his day. They were just coming into existence.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Endres:</B> That was the major debate between Jefferson and Hamilton  at the time.</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Yeah. And Jefferson warned that if they continued to exist we would just turn into a "slave state." Adam Smith had similar views. Go right up to leading democratic thinkers -- like, say, John Dewey, very mainstream, the leading American social philosopher in the 1920s. For him, democracy meant that you had to dismantle the private system of power. Politics, he said, is just the "shadow" cast by big business over the public system. And obviously, unless you get rid of the shadow, you don't have any politics. Workers have to take control over industry, you have to have industrial democracy, you have to dismantle absolutist private power of any kind and place it under public control -- all of this stuff is as American as apple pie.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Endres:</B> And it's not what you get from the versions of these  figures that have gone into the pantheon.</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Of course it's not what you get -- if it's even mentioned, it's considered some Maoist, Marxist lunacy. But this is just straight American thought, up until recently, when we've become <I>extremely</I> narrow, and by now, democracy just <I>means</I> big business casts its shadow over the political system. Period.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Slenk:</B> Do you think that all this implies that things are  getting worse in general in America, or better? For example,  your comment on younger generations accepting this political  correctness -- is this a positive indication? Is it widespread  enough? Should we really feel like there is hope?</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Well, I think things are going in both directions, like usually. There isn't a single tendency. The willingness of people to confront some of the realities of our history for the first time, like the extermination of the native population; the concern for women's issues and respect for other cultures; concerns for the environment; opposition to atrocities and aggression; those are all positive developments. You can trace them straight back to their origins in the movements of the 1960s, which have since expanded and proliferated and reached a very substantial part of the population. That's all to the good; we're just becoming a more civilized place.

<P>On the other hand, there's a reaction to it, as there always has been in American history. If you look through our history, there's a regular cycle of political ferment, activism, labor organizing, and independent thought, and it's always followed by sharp repression.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Endres:</B> Is that a typically American cycle? Or is that more  general?</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> I wouldn't say it's typically American, but it's somewhat more striking than in other comparable countries which happen to be a bit more tolerant. This is a business-run society. Business is highly class-conscious; they're fighting a vicious class war, and they know it, and they want to keep people basically demoralized, and separated and atomized.

<P>So you take a look at the 1890s. There was a lot of popular ferment, and then there was a big red-scare sort of thing, which crushed it. After the First World War, the same thing happened. The Wilson administration ran a very vicious red scare, which made the country very quiescent in the 1920s. Labor was beaten back, independent thought was eliminated, and so on. In the 1930s, with the Depression, ferment started again -- the war kind of put things on hold -- but right in the late forties, there was a big counter-attack. The victories for labor were reversed; the rights of organizing were effectively eliminated. There was a very sharp narrowing of the political spectrum; it was called McCarthyism but he was actually a latecomer. The 1950s were very quiet again, like the twenties. During the sixties, again you had ferment, connected with the Vietnam war and other things. And this time there was also a counter-reaction, a big counter-reaction. That's why you have big foundations like Bradley and Olan and the rest of them, trying to narrow and beat back the eduational system, so it becomes even more right wing and all that sort of stuff.

<P>And interestingly, this time it didn't work. That's an exception in American history. This time the ferment is continuing, maybe even expanding. And that's what we're right in the middle of. It's kind of an ideological struggle in which there's a lot of things going on. It's pretty complex. In the general population, there's a good deal of questioning and dissidence. The elite culture, on the other hand, is trying very hard to narrow it, to beat it back, to get back to quiescence and obedience. And it's a continuing struggle. It's a good sign.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Endres:</B> You seem to be spilling more ink on the domestic scene  recently, if only because the global arrangements are shifting  such that the consequences are becoming more apparent  domestically -- for example the fallout from the movements towards  so-called free trade.</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> That's absolutely right. This is in part just a consequence of the globalization of the economic system, which is in fact turning the United States into kind of a third world.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Endres:</B> In what way?</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Well, you know, a typical third world country has very sharp disparities of wealth and poverty. The wealth -- in Mexico or Brazil or something -- is very narrowly concentrated, a few percent of the population. And there's a huge superfluous population which is basically worthless for wealth production, and there they live in various kinds of misery and terror. This very sharply two-tiered model is typical of our dependencies of the third world. And we're not quite that way yet, and we're rich enough so that we probably won't be, but we're moving in that direction. Structurally it's looking like that more and more.

<P>That's partly a result of the internationalization of the economy. In the last twenty years it's become a lot easier to shift production elsewhere, to shift banking elsewhere, to move capital very quickly from one place to another to seek the maximal possible profit, which means maximum exploitation, minimum concern for the environment, and so on. That's a terrific weapon against the domestic populations. And it's used that way. NAFTA and GATT are exactly aimed at that.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Endres:</B> Sure. If you hadn't read the <CITE>New York Times,</CITE> or any of  the papers that follow its agenda, you would see that that's what  NAFTA is about. But of course all the coverage was to tell about  all the wonderful things that it was going to do for us.</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> It'll do wonderful things for a sector of the population. In fact, if you really look closely, they even tell you who they are. The day <I>after</I> the vote on NAFTA, which of course the press was highly enthusiastic for since it was a big business thing, the day <I>after</I> the vote, the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> published its first analysis of the effect on the New York region. And it was quite illuminating, not that it was a surprise, but it was interesting to see them say it. They were very upbeat; they said it was going to be great. And then they told you who the gainers would be, and who the losers would be. Well, it turns out the gainers would be banks, investors, corporate lawyers, public relations firms, you know, that kind of stuff. And the losers -- there was about a sentence on the losers -- among the losers they said would be women, blacks, Hispanics, and semi-skilled workers. Semi-skilled workers is about 75% of the workforce.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Endres:</B> Me, in other words.</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> The population. They're the losers. But the right guys, they'll be doing great. So therefore it was very upbeat. And that's exactly correct. These are social policies which are designed to increase polarization. Very likely to have the same effect in Mexico.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Endres:</B> What does the uprising in Chiapas -- in the southernmost  and poorest state of Mexico -- what does that have to tell us  about NAFTA?</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> A lot.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Endres:</B> And are those lessons being even observed?</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Well, yeah, there are people here who are observing them, actually.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Endres:</B> I'm talking about in the mainstream.</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> In the mainstream, well, that's interesting. I'll tell you a personal story. I was asked by the <CITE>Washington Post,</CITE> for the first time in my life, to write an op-ed on this. And I did, a long one. They asked me for a long, two-thousand word op-ed, which I wrote, and it was supposed to go in the weekend review section. And at the last minute, in fact I think after the deadline, it was killed by some top editor. So it didn't appear, although it does appear in <CITE>In These Times,</CITE> a couple of weeks later.

<P>And it's about exactly this topic. The Chiapas uprising was timed for the day of the beginning of NAFTA; that was symbolic. Not because their problems start with NAFTA, but because they describe NAFTA as a "death sentence" for the indigenous populations and in fact for the poor generally. And the Chiapas revolt had enormous support within Mexico. The Mexican government backed off from just destroying it by violence because there was just too much popular support. Polls showed about 75% support. Which is not surprising, because this "economic miracle" in Mexico that everyone raves about left out about 85% of the population -- not only left them out, but they declined in absolute terms during the period of the "miracle."

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Endres:</B> That's standard.</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Yeah, that's exactly what these policies are designed for. But we only talk about the rich guys, and they did fine, so it's a miracle.

<P>Compare Chiapas to South Central Los Angeles a couple of years ago, the uprising there. In a sense, they were about the same thing. They were about the social policies which are marginalizing and making superfluous a huge part of the population. South Central Los Angeles is an area where people used to have jobs. There were industries, there were furniture factories, heavy industry. Well, they've gone to places where you can get cheaper labor and you don't have to worry about the environment. So these people are essentially useless. They have no human rights any more because they don't contribute to wealth production. And they're just declining.

<P>Well, Chiapas is a similar situation. Of course, Chiapas is <I>objectively,</I></CITE> much poorer -- fewer television sets and bathtubs and so on. On the other hand, it's striking that in Chiapas, one of the most impoverished sectors of the hemisphere, there is still a lively, vibrant society, which has a cultural tradition of freedom and social organization. So they were able to respond in a highly constructive way. They were able to organize, they have positions, they have public support.

<P>Now take a look at South Central Los Angeles. That was just a riot. This is the response of a completely demoralized society, where it's just disintegrated. It doesn't have social bonds, it doesn't have goals, doesn't have hopes. And that's the difference. That tells a lot about the United States, actually.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Endres:</B> The media picture of the Zapatistas is not the one you're  painting here. They can't refer to them without noting the fact  that they're "gun-toting" and "ski-mask-wearing;" of course  they leave out the part that if the Mexican government knew who  they were, they would be delivered to their relatives as a pile  of bones, as happened a few weeks ago.</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Of course. The problem is, the Mexican government knows that they just reflect the general population. They can read the polls that say 75% support. In fact, they've had a tremendous appeal in Mexico. This Subcommander Marcos, this guy who's the spokesman, he's one of the big popular figures in Mexico.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Endres:</B> I read something, there's a poll that says he's considered  the sexiest something or other.</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> The commercial system is of course picking him up and trying to cheapen it, like they do with rock music and stuff, but it reflects something. It reflects the appeal. They've really captured the imagination of people in Mexico and they have a very constructive program. You look at their program and it makes a lot of sense.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Slenk:</B> It seems like you process a potentially insane amount of  bad news. And I wonder, What is it that either keeps you going  or keeps you hopeful? You've commented that you have a basic  faith in people's common sense. Is this what you're holding out  for?</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Yeah, basically. It varies, depending on mood, but it doesn't mean much. I mean, what's the difference what <I>I</I> think? But if you look at history and just your personal experience, it seems to me there's plenty of evidence to indicate that people are perfectly capable of doing quite wonderful things. They often don't, they often do quite horrible things. Any sane person is going to try to shift the balance. What more can one say? It doesn't matter what you think the probabilities are. Suppose you think that the probabilities are, say, two percent that things can get better. Well, okay, then you pay attention to that two percent.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Endres:</B> I personally happen to share your faith in people. People  have an ability to use their common sense to figure out what the  hell's going on, and analyze it in constructive ways, and defend  themselves from manipulation. People can certainly do that. But  they're <I>not.</I> Do you have any opinions on why that is?</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Sure. Let's take a family in downtown Boston where, say, the husband's a telephone lineman and the wife's a secretary, and they've got three kids, and they both have to work full time and maybe overtime just to feed them. If they don't spend a lot of time trying to figure out what's going on in the world, well, I don't consider that a crime.

<P>On the other hand, let's go over to the Harvard Faculty Club, where they have basically nothing to do. They have every resource and they're highly privileged. Suppose that <I>they</I> refuse to figure out what's happening in the world, and in fact work very hard to <I>not</I> see it, and to prevent others from seeing it. Well, that's different. In fact, that's the reality.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Endres:</B> I have two acquaintances: one is a poli sci undergrad at  Columbia; she's specializing in Latin American concerns. The  other is a graduate student at George Washington in third world  debt-wonking. One would expect that they would at least reflect a  basic understanding of the concerns of the people in those areas:  not so. Furthermore, in conversation with these people -- who I  hasten to add are bright young people -- to even bring up basic  questions of assumptions about US power, say, is to invite a dose  of venom.</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> That's right. But that's the way the doctrinal system works. It is a system that filters and shapes and controls to try to lead to conformity to power and lack of questioning. And in fact, people who don't succumb to those rules are usually filtered out in some fashion. That's serious. Here we're getting to the core of the propaganda system.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Endres:</B> Abstractly, that's the core. Let's turn it around and  look at some very pragmatic concerns for activism, for what we  can do. How can we go about counteracting that?</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> No big secrets. You try to construct organizations, construct your own media, engage in constructive activities, often local activities; international issues like NAFTA, health care, welfare issues, whatever's locally going on in your neighborhood. There's tons of things. By involving people in those things, they learn. They become educated, they see the world differently. If it can extend to a sufficient scale, it can have a real impact. As I said, the country's a lot different from what it was thirty years ago, just in those kinds of ways.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Slenk:</B> You've managed to shine in two very important fields. In  linguistics, you've been amazing, and also in your outspokenness  on the propaganda model. How do you manage to do this? Do you  sleep?</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Yeah, sometimes. I got back from a talk last night about midnight, and started going through huge piles of newspapers and tons of mail and so on and so forth. And I got started again this morning, and here we are [10:00am]. That's the way it goes all the time.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Slenk:</B> Have you done this mostly on your own? Have you had  plenty of aid? It seems like striking out on your own this way  is suicidal.</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> On this side of the fence, you do it alone.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Slenk:</B> Really?</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Oh, yeah. I mean, somebody will address my letters or something. But it's obvious that you're not going to get resources for this kind of work. In fact they'd pay me <I>not</I> to do it. Other forms of association develop which are very helpful. There are a lot of people around the world who are in the same position, and without any planning, you tend to get into contact. So a lot of my correspondence is around the world. A lot of my time, in fact, is spent clipping journals, newspapers, professional journals and so on -- actually I bought a Xerox machine for this -- and Xeroxing materials to send to people overseas, who are interested in similar things and don't have access to what I see. And they do the same for me. So there's a ton of information flow around the world, from essentially dissidents in many countries. And it turns out to be extremely informative.

<P>So places that I'm interested in, I just know more. I can easily get to know more than they do in the CIA or any academic research center. And the reason is that I have smart agents, not dumb agents. They know what's important and they can dig things out. The countries that I'm really interested in, say Israel -- I could never read the Hebrew press by myself, it's just too much of a job. But if I have friends there, clipping for me and sending me articles, they're picking what is important -- we sort of share understanding. And I do the same for them. A lot of the work I've done on southeast Asia, Timor and so on, comes mostly from the Australian press. Just tons of stuff from there. And it's reciprocal.

<P>These turn out to be extremely useful networks. These are the ways in which people lacking in resources can pool their efforts, and end up being quite powerful. That's exactly what organization means. And these days, it can be international. A lot of these people are personal friends who I've never seen.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Endres:</B> This brings us to another interesting question. You  brought this up in the <CITE>Rolling Stone</CITE> interview, and in some  other places, talking about honest journalists who -- fully aware  of the constraints that they face -- are "working within the  system," for lack of a better phrase. The only person I can  think of in this country, although I certainly don't read  everything, is Alexander Cockburn. Who else is there?</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Oh, there are quite a few. I purposely didn't mention any names because some of them are very well-known people, and they don't want me to say publicly that they are trying to see how much they can get around the constraints of the major media.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Endres:</B> Because it's a pretty intricate chess game.</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> It is, yeah. But some of the top investigative reporters, for example, are <I>very</I> conscious of the way the system works, and in fact kind of play it like a violin. They look for moments when things can be sneaked through.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Endres:</B> What kind of tactics do they use? How does this play  itself out?</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Well, there are a lot of tactics. If you're in the media, you right off know that every couple of years there's a scandal, like Irangate or something like that, because the whole system's so corrupt that occasionally things blow up. After a scandal, there's kind of a window of opportunity: the media always open up a bit after a scandal. The constraints on what's allowed in drop a little bit and you can sneak in stories. And people do that. They'll store up stories on topics that they've researched, and wait for a time when it's going to be a little more lax and you can put it in.

<P>Or you look for the right editor. You frame things, you write things very carefully. Actually I know people who have gone from the newsweeklies to television, precisely because -- although they get much less time and space on television, you get maybe ninety seconds -- it's your ninety seconds. There's not a lot they can do with it. If you send something to the newsweeklies they totally rewrite it and it comes out the opposite of what you meant.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Endres:</B> You were talking about global networking, which my  impression is that you do with paper mail. For me, the Internet  is just an amazing resource.</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> That's right.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Endres:</B> Do you use the Internet much?</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> To some extent. By now, a fair amount of the material I get comes through the Internet. I just find I <I>can't</I> use it much, because the amount of information is such that I get totally swamped. I have friends who filter it for me, and that's a help.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Endres:</B> In general, what do you think are the positive and  negative impacts of technology, particularly communications  technology, on democracy and activism?</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Well, that's a big issue. In fact, it's kind of reminiscent of what happened with radio about the 1920s and '30s. When radio came along -- it's like the Internet, it's a fixed resource, it's not like selling shoes. Which means it was obviously going to be government regulated. No alternative. And the question is, How would it work? Would it be devoted to the public interest, and be essentially a democratizing instrument, or would it be turned over to private power, and commercialized?

<P>There was a struggle over it. There were public interest groups, and church groups, and labor unions, and so on, who wanted it to be a public interest entity. And they lost. It was totally commercialized. And the United States, I think, was alone in the world in that respect. Every other country I know of, at least, went the other way. When television came along, again the US split from the rest of the world, but it wasn't even an issue this time; business just took it over, period.

<P>We're now facing a similar question.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Endres:</B> This is a very vital and vibrant fight at the moment.</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Absolutely. And it's very important to know how it goes. It could turn out, as you described, to be a democratizing force, with public participation, or it could end up being a mechanism for corporate propaganda, creating artificial wants, and buying things faster and so on. I think it's going to be the second, just because of the balance of forces.

<P>It doesn't have to be. It could be very significant. This is something that people ought to fight about, because it doesn't have to turn out that way.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Endres:</B> You've said numerous times that you feel "privileged" to  have been able to witness people fighting for their freedoms in  Vietnam, and Laos, and Palestine, and Nicaragua, and maybe other  places, for all I know. In what ways can those people -- active  and engaged and fighting -- teach us, here in the US, and in what  ways are our fights different?</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> It's different, but increasingly similar. Take Chiapas, Mexico. They have a lot to teach us. They teach us how a very impoverished and oppressed community has succeeded in maintaining a vibrant tradition of freedom and democracy which we have lost, we have allowed to slip out of our hands, and which we better recover, or the world's going to be in trouble.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Endres:</B> Why is it so important for the rest of the world that we  maintain a humanistic culture?</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> The United States is so rich and powerful that nothing much can happen in the world if we don't let it happen. There won't be any freedom in Mexico if we don't allow it.

<P>Take Haiti, right next door. Haiti is a case where there was a major victory for democracy. A really major victory. Here again is a deeply impoverished country which developed a very rich array of popular organizations, grassroots organizations, and they swept into office a candidate with a populist program which was extremely successful. The international lending institutions were full of praise for it, and gave them all sorts of aid.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Endres:</B> You're talking about [Jean-Bertrand] Aristide.</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Aristide. And he was overthrown very quickly, and since then the United States has been trying to keep him out. That's what we're trying to do right now, in fact.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Endres:</B> Contrary to what the tenor of the story has been.</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Yeah. You just look at the details and it's quite clear. The US is just trying to drag it along.

<P>In fact, it's not well known, but there's supposed to be an embargo [imposed after the coup by the Organization of American States]. US trade with Haiti <I>increased</I> last year under Clinton. Furthermore, Haiti is exporting <I>food</I> to the United States. This is a starving country. The exports of food from Haiti to the United States went up by a factor of <I>thirty-six</I> last year. That's fruit, nuts, citrus, melons, things like that. It's mind boggling.

<P>Meanwhile, they can't figure out how to tell the Dominican military to monitor the border. The Dominican military, they're like in our pocket, but we can't figure out how to tell them to monitor the border [to stanch the illegal flow of petroleum and narcotics that props up the military government].

<P>The Haitian military lives on narcotrafficing. Take a look: you'll notice that the US Navy and Air Force have not stopped a <I>single vessel</I>--plane or ship -- bringing drugs in and out of Haiti. I mean, they're <I>blockading</I> the place. They stop every single refugee boat, but they can't find any narcotrafficers. In fact, they were asked about this by the Black Caucus, and they got an answer, which was reported in the press with a straight face: they said, `Well, the problem is that the Haitian military' -- namely, the narcotrafficers, who we work with on this, interestingly -- `they don't have radar.' The US Navy and Air Force can't figure out a way to remedy this defect, naturally.

<P>The thing is a joke. The US is standing by while the popular organizations get decimated. They want an arrangement in which Aristide does what they call "broaden his government." "Broaden" means kick out the two thirds of the population that voted for him, and bring in the military and the business sectors and let them run it. That's broadening the government. And then he'll be allowed to be a symbolic figure. And if the Clinton administration can just drag this out for a year or two, it's finished, because his term's over.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Endres:</B> I'm going to resist the temptation to ask you to end on an  upbeat note, but I'll give you a chance to plug the media outlets  that often carry you.</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Well, that's really important. One of the very important developments of the past thirty years in fact has been the expansion of all sorts of independent media outlets -- alternative radio, alternative press -- and that's reached an awful lot of people, and has helped revitalize this declining democratic tradition. That's really a very significant development, in my opinion.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Endres:</B> What magazines do you write for?</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Right now, I write mainly for <CITE>Z Magazine</CITE> and <CITE>Lies of Our Times,</CITE> and as I say I just had something in <CITE>In These Times,</CITE> and occasionally elsewhere.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Endres:</B> Which are good and highly recommended. It has just been a  thrill for us to have a chance to talk to you.</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Oh, I'm delighted. I hope we can do it again. Good luck with what you're doing.

<H2>Counterpoint Interview</H2>

<P>October 25, 1993

<P><TABLE WIDTH=66%><TR><TD> <I>The following is an interview broadcast over WPKN Bridgeport on 10/25/93. WPKN (89.5 FM) is a listener-supported radio station which broadcasts a public affairs show "Counterpoint" at 10PM Monday nights.</I>

<P>In introducing Noam Chomsky, many of you know he is internationally known for his groundbreaking work in linguistics at M.I.T.; at the same time he is equally well known around the world for his informed critique of the political and economic structure of the United States. He has been referred to as the nation's leading progressive dissident. Dick Fugat (sp?), writing in the Whole Earth review recently said of one of Chomsky's books, said of NC's abilities as a commentator: "NC is one of those rare people whose insights are so penatrating that they can radically alter our perception of the world", and I think that that's a succinct way to pigeonhole Chomsky, which is a difficult thing to do. So, without further ado, we'll get to an interview that I conducted with Noam Chomsky just a few hours ago on the phone from his home in Massachusetts, and the subject of the talk was U.S. Foreign Policy in the Post-Cold War era, so we'll get to that talk right now.

<P><HR WIDTH=66%>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Q:</B> After the collapse of the Soviet Union, many people in this country and around the world looked forward to a revamped U.S. foreign policy, a policy that would put less emphasis on military domination and covert operations against nations of the developing world. I wondered if you would comment on that optimistic attitude that many people took with them after the collapse of the other superpower: How realistic was that?</FONT>

<P><B>Noam Chomsky:</B> Oh, I think it was completely unrealistic, and it was based on a complete misunderstanding of what third world intervention has been about. I mean, of course, a completely understandable misunderstanding because for 70 years it has been claimed that third world intervention was somehow a response to a soviet threat, a threat that was claimed immediately after the Bolshevik revolution. But that was, I mean, anyone who looked at the case could see right off that that wasent true, and in fact the whole cold war more or less fell within the pattern of so called North-South conflict. The U.S. intervenes in the third world because a section tries to depart from its service function and moves towards independence. It doesn't matter what policies it's pursuing, people can be communists, or fascists, or liberation theology priests, or democratic capitalists, or whatever: it's independence that is unacceptable, and the documentary record is perfectly plain about this. the internal planning and historical record is plain. The Soviet Union, and in fact all Eastern Europe were a huge part of the original third world. They were Europe's service area. When they moved towards independence that immediately created a conflict: The west invaded at once and the conflict was going on instantly. They happened to be a part of the Third World with a big army, a military force, so it took years to grind them down and return them to their Third World status, which is pretty much what's happening now. Meanwhile, the game goes on elsewhere as before: George Bush celebrated the fall of the Berlin wall by invading Panama a couple of weeks later. It was so standard as to be barely a footnote to history, but it did have a different pretext. You could no longer appeal to the threat of the soviet Union, so we were there to defend ourselves from Hispanic narcotrafficers. And so it continues. There is a change, and the change was discussed back in the mid-'80's, I was writing about it then, and in fact it's explicit in the new Clinton foreign policy. About a month ago, in the last week of September, there was a series of major speeches and documents that came out from the Clinton administration outlining the "Clinton Doctrine," their new foreign policy. And with regard to intervention, the basic principle was stated clearly : we will now intervene where and how we choose with no longer any concern about a Soviet deterrent. That was said very plain, and in fact even the press reported it plain. And that's quite true, with the Soviet deterrent gone, that's just one barrier against intervention removed.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Q:</B> I was certainly going to ask you specifically about the Clinton administration, how they've shaped foreign policy. in the early days of what is really the first presidency to take office in the Post Cold war era. As you mentioned, of the major speeches of Clinton, one stands out, the U.N. Speech.</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Right.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Q:</B> He stated and stressed support for "market democracies". What is your view of the value placed by Clinton and the elites of this country on the two components cited by Clinton: market economics and democracy?</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> The Clinton administration is exactly like its predecessors in that respect. With regard to markets, the U.S., and the west generally has generally had kind of a double edged stand. It would very much like to impose market discipline on the third world, because that will make it much easier to rob them. In a market situation, the rich and powerful win out. On the other hand, no developed country, certainly not the United States would accept market discipline at home. Every developed society, beginning with England in the 18th century, and up to the east Asian tigers today, and crucially including us, has gotten that way by radically violating market principles, and stays that way by doing exactly the same. The Reagan administration, for example, was one of the most protectionist in recent American history, and in fact James Baker, when he was secretary of the Treasury, took pains to announce quite proudly (to the business community, of course, not to the public) that the Reagan administration had been more protectionist than any in the past 50 years. This was quite accurate, and that remains the case. So, markets are great for them, because it makes it easier to rob them, but we'll violate the market principles as we like. and in fact part of the new Clinton program in this rash of speeches and panels and so on that came out in the last week of September coordinated was in fact an international economic policy which announced what they called a New Export strategy that would violate the GATT rules, the international trade agreement. It would violate them more radically than the Reaganites had done and they said so pretty straight. this would include new GATT violating subsidies through the export-import bank for purchase of U.S. goods, of course in violation of GATT as they always have been, and new subsidies for purchases of U.S. goods, and so forth and so on. Of course, they said we're opposed to the policies we're implementing, because they're interfering with the market, but then comes the usual apologia that by violating these principles we'll be in a better position to stop others from violating them. That's the standard "War means Peace" line, straight out of Orwell. As far as democracy's concerned, the Clinton administration is at one with its predecessors in being in favor of a certain form of democracy. And again, they're pretty explicit about it. So, for example one of the former Reagan state department officials who was involved in what they called "democracy enhancing" operations has just written a book and several articles about the Reagan administration policies. And he's an honest man, Thomas Carothers (sp?) is his name, and he takes the sincerity of the impulse for democracy very seriously although his own evidence suffices to show that it was totally cynical. But he does point out, correctly, that Reagan initiatives were negatively correlated with democracy; that is, where U.S. influence was least (like in the southern cone of Latin America) the moves towards democracy were greatest. And the Reagan administration opposed them, but later took credit for them. Where U.S. influence was strongest, like in Central America, the moves towards democracy were, in any meaningful sense, least, in fact negative by and large. And he also points out that though the Reagan administration talked about democracy, they, as he puts it "inevitably sought a kind of top down democracy which would leave intact the traditional centers of power, which as he admits were all strongly anti-democratic. And that's true, and the Clinton Administration is the same. So take their Haiti policy: They're simply carrying out what was the Bush policy without much change. They would like to get the elected president, president Aristide, back in office because it looks kind of embarrassing to have somebody overthrown, a democratically elected leader overthrown by a bunch of brutal military gangsters right under our eyes. They would like to get him back in office, but essentially in a cubicle, powerless. They've already forced him to select a prime minister who, as everyone concedes, is opposed to his populist reforms. The idea is to get what they call "moderate elements of the business community" in charge, people who agree with the U.S. policy of turning Haiti into an export platform, cut out the mass of popular organizations, which to everyone's amazement swept Aristide to power, and then broaden the government, as they're now talking about, to open the door to real right wing thugs in the interest of democracy. So, democracy must mean a spectrum going from the moderate right to the far right, which is a very narrow spectrum in Haiti, with the elected president a figurehead and the popular organizations either decimated and destroyed, or just marginalized: that's democracy, top down democracy which leaves traditional structures in place exactly as Thomas Carrothers pointed out, and has always been true.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Q:</B> The Clinton administration also seems to have shown its cards in handling the recent crisis in Russia, where Boris Yeltsin dissolved his nation's parliament. American economics seem to once again take precedence over the democratic process, in that country in particular.</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Well, that's market economics for them. Notice we definitely want Russia as part of the third world to accept market discipline of the kind we would never accept and we would demand that. Boris Yeltsin is a democrat because he went along with that. In fact, Boris Yeltsin is a tough, brutal former communist party boss. He was a boss at sverdlofs (sp?), one of the toughest communist party bureaucrats. He surrounded himself with his own bureaucracy, with his former subordinates. His latest moves, as quite a few Soviet scholars and others have pointed out, have simply reversed the democratic gains that had been made haltingly since 1989, initiated by Gorbachev, including the election of the parliament in 1990, which was just as democratic and free as his election. He just wants to destroy other centers of power and return Russia to a kind of dictatorship. And the West is perfectly in favor of that, as long as he opens up the country for investment and doesn't put up any barriers to export and utilization of Russian resources, and so on. That's the so called market economy.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Q:</B> During the crisis in Russia, our media certainly presented a picture of what was going on as a choice between Boris Yeltsin, a "democrat", as you said, and what they termed "hard liners", those people who wanted to reimpose hard line communism on the people of Russia. How accurate, or inaccurate, in your view, was that analysis, which really was fairly consistent across the spectrum?</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> It was consistent, and it reflected the judgment of the financial markets, who much preferred Yeltsin for the reasons I mentioned. No, of course, it was total nonsense, I mean there were plenty of, the group around parliament was quite a diverse group. It included fascists, it included old-line communists, but the main people involved were exactly the people who supported Yeltsin. In fact they had backed him all the way through. The liberal leader who had been a western style liberal, Ronsev (sp?), who had been leading the effort to develop a new liberal constitution was with the parliament, for example.  Overall, parliament was in favor of the same market reforms, but did not want them to be carried out in such a destructive fashion(reflecting popular concerns, incidentally). so certainly it was a mixture, there was no doubt that there were fascists and nazis and old time communists in the crowd there, just as there are around Yeltsin, in fact he himself an old time party boss as I mentioned. But the main center of parliamentary opposition was unacceptable to Yeltsin because they were and opposition, that is they had a different conception of how policy should be developed, and he wants to run it with an iron hand. The western media called them "hard liners" and "opposed to democracy" and so on because essentially that's the orders. The West will support all sorts. Like take somebody like Suharto, I mean a major mass murderer. Here's somebody who came into office with a major massacre in which half a million or a million people were slaughtered within the a few months. He's been carrying out a near genocidal war in East Timor and compiled one of the world's worst human rights records as Amnesty International has pointed out over and over, and in the West he's described as a moderate.  He's a moderate who is "at heart benign", as the London Economist put it. The reason is he's opened up the country to Western exploitation. They liked Sadaam Hussein as long as he was following orders. I mean up until August 1, 1990, neither Britain or the United States had any objection to Saddam Hussein.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Q:</B> When you look at the situation in Russia, certainly the fact that they have tens of thousands of nuclear weapons is important to this country and the rest of the world. What do you see happening there? The fact that Boris Yeltsin has won this round does not really determine what the final end will be in terms of restructuring that nation's domestic road. I mean what do you see happening there?</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Well, the free market, what's called "market shock" that is the rapid imposition of market reforms which would devastate any society had a devastating effect on the stagnating and rather weak Soviet economy too. So, there's been a very sharp decline in production and living standards and so on, except for a small sector; there's been a new wealthy sector as happens in the third world. So theres, one Soviet scholor Robert Daniels called it a group of gangsters and mafiosi and speculators which is not very far from true. the population is now very much demoralized, the support for democracy has declined radically, as has Yeltsin's support. But according to polls, there are now very objective polls taken inside Russia, western run and domestically run and very reliable, and they indicate a strong tendency to, that just wants a strong leader, a strong dictatorial leader, and that's what Yeltsin will put himself forward as. A strong man who will somehow save them. How that will turn out is very hard to predict. It's not likely in my view that the population will long accept the sharp decline in the character of life thats a consequence of their return to the third world. But of course, in other countries its been possible to maintain it for a long time. Take a country like, say, Brazil, which is a super-rich country with huge resources and wasn't all that different from Russia say, prior to the Russian Revolution about 70 years ago, but now, and its had every imaginable advantage, its been the recipient of vast amounts of aid and investment, its been under U.S. tutelage almost completely since 1945, and very openly. For about 10% of the population, its great. You know, they live like rich western Europeans, and most of the rest live like people in central Africa. Its one of the biggest economies in the world, it ranks in 80th place, right next to Albania and Paraquay in the U.N. assessments of quality of life. Well, they've managed to hold the population down, often resorting to terror. Its very hard to predict these things.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Q:</B> On another subject, going back to some of the hot-spots around the world, such as Somalia and Bosnia, I wonder how you feel the nation's elites now define U.S. interests during the Post Cold War Era. We have Senator Bob Dole, a Republican who have made statements negating any U.S. interest in places such as Haiti. Many others in mainstream political circles state that no U.S. interests exist in places such as Somalia or Bosnia, a very tragic war that has claimed hundreds, thousands of lives. What do you interpret as the political elites and how they determine their political and economic interests across the globe?</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Very much as they have before. The basic question is: what are the interests of the U.S. based corporate and financial system, which increasingly means transnational corporations, international banks and investment firms, and so on, and what are the interests of the global system of which they are a central part. Global state supported capitalist system. That's U.S interest, and beyond that there are just tactical judgments,. Take Haiti. There's no, as far as I can see, substantial difference of opinion between Dole and Clinton on this. The question is how important it is to maintain Haiti as an export platform, for super cheap labor for U.S. run assembly plants, how disruptive would it be if the country just collapsed into total chaos and essentially self destructed. And does the U.S. have an interest in maintaining the pose of being concerned about democracy in the hemisphere. Thats roughly the difference between them. they have slightly different tactical judgments on this. On the Balkans, there is no substantial element of the U.S.  elite that wants any direct involvement because it would just be too costly to their own interests. They would like to see the situation simmer down. In fact, you mentioned quite accurately Bosnia is a terrible tragedy: so it is. But compare it to, say, Angola which is as bad or worse a atrocity, with killings as bad or higher, and the destruction apparently greater as well. Compare the attention to Bosnia and Angola: its just radically different. Why should that be? Well, it has nothing to do with human rights. Human rights are being sacrificed and destroyed more in Angola. So Sarajevo's being destroyed and tortured, but probably twice as many people have been killed in Quito. So what's the difference? the difference is that what happens in the Balkens affects the interests of rich white people. It affects Europe's interests and it affects American interests. What happens in Angola doesn't affect those interests very much. Furthermore, in Bosnia you can sort of blame what happens on "bad guys", you know, crazed Serb peasants, and so on. In Angola, you have to blame it on UNITA and Jonas Savimbi, our man, who received a huge amount of U.S. aid and was hailed to the skies as a great freedom fighter, you know, the George Washington, the Thomas Jefferson of the 20th century by the Reaganites. Well, that doesn't look so good, so therefore its better to be concerned about Bosnia than Angola. But as far as U.S. interests are concerned, their interests, I mean not your interests or mine, but elite interests are concerned, they are to preserve their power, wealth, domination, authority, nothing novel about that, nor anything unique to the United States, and judgments are made accordingly. There are tactical differences within elite groups, but I don't see that they go very far.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Q:</B> We're speaking with Noam Chomsky, professor of linguistics at M.I.T., Noam Chomsky being one of the most respected critics of the U.S. economic and political power structures. Professor Chomsky, I wondered if you would address the United Nations and their role now in the Post Cold War era. The U.S. has seemed to use the U.N., certainly starting with the Gulf War, and certainly driving the U.N. to take certain actions, having the military power and certainly the economic power to pressure various states around the world to participate, or to vote for various actions that the U.S. advocated. But certainly there are some drawbacks, were the U.N. may become tainted in the future, if it hasn't already in certain respects. I wonder if you have any hope that the U.N. can really can be an arbiter and a peacemaker around the world, especially as we've seen so much strife and nationalism coming to the fore, that was, for better or worse, held in check by the cold war for the last 40 years?</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> The U.N. is not an independent organization. It's the agency of the states of the world, and it cannot do anything that they don't initiate and approve of. Power among the states of the world is not evenly distributed, to put it mildly. The United States has always had overwhelming power, and ever since the founding of the United Nations. Now its degree of power has varied over the years. If you look at the U.S. government's attitude towards the U.N., and the attitudes of the media, the intellectual elites, and so on, (which is about the same), they reflect very closely the degree to which to which the U.N. follows U.S. orders. I've reviewed this in close detail, in print, and can show you some of the data if you want, but roughly its like this. At the time the U.N. was founded, U.S. power in the world was simply overwhelming. It was right after the second World War, there had been no historical parallel to U.S. power, and the U.N. was essentially an agency of the U.S., used for U.S. interests, primarily cold war interests, so against the Russians, and against the third world, and so on. At that time, the U.N. was very much loved, because it was doing exactly what we told it to, and the Russians were denounced for vetoing resolutions, and being obstructionist, and so on and so forth. Terrible communists. By the mid 1950's, that was beginning to change. For one thing, decolonization had brought many new members into the United Nations. The non-aligned movement had developed, Europe and Japan were recovering from the world war destruction and were becoming independent entities in their own right, and the U.N. became somewhat more independent of the U.S. for these reasons, and the U.S. became more hostile to it by the mid-late 1960's, the U.S. was very hostile to it. And in fact, in subsequent years, it virtually destroyed the organization. The U.S. is way ahead of anyone else in refusing to pay its dues. It specifically refused, especially under the Reagan Administration, tried to destroy and succeeded virtually in destroying UNESCO and other organs of the U.N. that were primarily devoted to third world interests. If you simply look at the record of vetos since the 1960's, the US is in the lead in security council vetos, Britain, which is a U.S. client, is second, France is third and Russia is fourth, far behind. So that's simply never reported. In the late `40s and `50s, there was much denunciation of the Russian veto, but since the 1970 you don't find anything about the U.S. veto, that's just a blocked story. Similarly, the occasional story will ask why is the world out of step, or something like that, the record in the General Assembly is quite the same, the U.S. was voting alone or almost alone against the entire world so you'd get votes like 150--1 on issues of international law, observing human rights, aggression, disarmament, a whole range of topics. So it was essentially not reported here, or else the U.N. was simply disparaged, by the late 1980's, the situation was shifting back. The Russians and the Eastern Europe were disappearing, Europe was backing off and abdicated, leaving the U.S. to do what it wanted. The third world was in total disarray, I mean there was a real catastrophe in the capitalist world in the 1980's as the traditional colonial domains were completely devastated. And of course, with the disappearance of the Soviet Union, any room for non-alignment had gone, so the U.N. became popular again, because now its doing what the U.S. tells it to again. Can the U.N. be an independent force for peace and justice and so on? In principle, but that depends on what happens internally in the powerful countries, primarily here. If U.S. citizens make a radical change, and they're the only ones who can do it, in the culture, and character, and stand and policies of the U.S., then the U.N. will reflect that.

<H2>Jerry Brown Interviews Noam Chomsky <BR>
(Excerpts)</H2>
<P><CITE>SPIN Magazine,</CITE> August 1993

<I>Noam Chomsky is a capitalist's worst nightmare 
<BR>Jerry Brown kept Bill Clinton sleepless on the campaign trail.

<H3>Jerry Brown's Introduction</H3>

<P>During my campaign for president in 1992, I experienced for the first time the full weight of the money-media system of control. Having been so much a part of that system, I had not fully grasped the radical dominance of politics by the top 1 percent and the complicit role of the media. All this became  clear once I swore off donations above $100 and refused to attend the sacred rite of endless political fundraising with the wealthy. This made the media turn aside, for they knew I was not a "serious" candidate committed to the proposition: Money buys media, media buys credibility. 

<P>But Professor Noam Chomsky has gone much further in peeling back the myths. A renowned professor of linguistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he is best known for his stark analysis of the American system of power. His books and lecture take you where few dare to tread. He is not afraid of his peers and doesn't let public disapproval intimidate him -- he ruthlessly exposes the deceits that cover up the dark side of power and the media conformity that makes it possible. 

<P>I promised to speak truth to power -- and found Chomsky had already been doing it for 30 years. This interview captures the spirit and key elements of his devastating critique. Savor it. Let it engage you as it assaults your complacency. Then act.  

<P>Everything politics is, Chomsky isn't. That why this interview is important: it will allow you to perceive contemporary society -- its government, its commodity fetishes, its cruelty -- in a starker light. 
Chomsky gives you a lens through which you can see. 

<HR>

<H3>Excerpts from the Interview</H3>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Jerry Brown:</B> But the military was a larger percentage of the Gross National Product (GNP) in the 50s and 60s than it became in the 80s.</FONT>

<P><B>Noam Chomsky:</B> Well, except for the peak in the early Reagan years. But it doesn't make sense for the military to be measured against the GNP. Suppose you're trying to protect yourself from the guy next door -- if you get richer, you don't need more guns. In fact, you need less 'cause you have other kinds of power. [...]

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Brown:</B> It's amazing to me how much the elites in this country are in agreement on the value of NAFTA. It just seems natural to them that the scale of corporate activity should increase across borders.</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> "Growth" is a funny sort of concept. For example, our GNP increases every time we build a prison. Well, okay, it's growth in a sense, but it's kind of a dumb measure. Has our life improved if we have more people in prison?

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Brown:</B> And a poor person will add more to the GNP with a cancer that is treated under Medicaid than if they work in a minimum wage job.</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Exactly, yeah. And things like preventive health don't show up in increasing the GNP. In fact, they might even reduce it, because it means you waste less money in high technology care later. So a lot of this stuff really is theology. I'm not saying that economics is a joke. It's a serious subject. But the way it's applied as policy is just theology. It's as crazy as Khomeni. Crazier in many ways. Kind of like fundamentalism. It emphasizes particular values: growth, profit, macroeconomic statistics -- in ways which have almost no human meaning. [...]

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Brown:</B> Yeah, an example of the corruption of our thinking: When the President proposes immunizing children, he doesn't say the purpose is to minimize suffering, but rather to save money in the long run.</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> That's a perfect example: The idea that you might want to save children, even if you lose money by it, doesn't arise.

<P>The elites, including the educated classes, are going towards reducing moral values and turning people into nothing but agents of production and profit. So the deal is you try to glue everybody to the television set, where they get bombarded from childhood with messages that tell them: You've got to buy more, your human value depends on the number of commodities you've got piled up. There nothing else in life.

<P>On the other hand if you can't use them as tools of production, you stick them in jail or in the slums, or let 'em prey on one another, and have enough cops around to control them. That's a picture of the world, and it might lead to good macroeconomic statistics.

<P>A city like Boston -- rich, cultivated -- at the city hospital, they had to open a malnutrition clinic a couple of years ago. [...]

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Brown:</B> But now, the economics profession is arrayed against local power because it puts the greatest value on increasing the size of markets -- the larger the market, the more efficient the enterprise.</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Yeah, look: the Economics profession is basically a tool of private power. They have a doctorate, which is kind of a theology, which points out, sometimes correctly, that you can increase output by moving to market arrangement. Market arrangements essentially give more power to the powerful. That's what it amounts to. It's like a parliamentary system where the number of votes you have depends on the number of dollars you have.  Well, we know what kind of democracy that would be, and we know where it would end up.

<P>For one thing, future generations can't vote with their dollars in the market. My grandchildren can't decide how they want things spent, but there' going to have to live with it -- which means the environment.

<P>Take other issues: Suppose the people around here decide that instead of having more consumer good they'd like to have more leisure. The market system doesn't allow you that choice. It drives you to having more consumer goods because it's all driven to maximizing production. But is the only human value to have more and more good you don't need? In fact the business world knows that it's not. That's why they spend billions of dollars in advertising, to try to create artificial wants.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Brown:</B> The economists have a word, "autarchy," which they use to denigrate the notion of local self-reliance.</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Yeah, they say it's bad. What "autarchy" means is people in some area saying, "Look, we'd like our lifes to be like this, not like you guys tell us." Take Japan. Part of the Japan-bashing now is because Japan protects, say, mom-and-pop-style stores, and that blocks big supermarket chains from the West from coming in and taking overt.

<P>Well, suppose Japan would *like* to have a community where you have mom-and-pop stores. I can remember that from childhood. You go 'round the corner and you pick up a loaf of bread, and you talk to the grocer. It's a lot nicer than going into the supermarket.

<P>Now it's economically inefficient by the economist's measures. It means that things cost a little bit more. But suppose people say, okay, I'm willing to spend a little more because I want a nicer life. The economists say you're not allowed to make that decision, because the only human value  in the world is maximizing profit and efficiency. Who says that's the only human value?

<P>Adam Smith didn't think so. You go back and read their hero. What he said, in fact, is that in any civilized country, the government is going to have to intervene to prevent market forces from destroying people and reducing them to creatures as ignorant and stupid as is possible for a human being to be. The natural effect of the division of labor, maximizing efficiency, is going to turn people into tools.

<P><H1>Michael Albert and Noam Chomsky</H1>



<P>From <A HREF="http://www.lbbs.org/">ZNet</A>



<P><P><TABLE WIDTH=66%><TR><TD>

In January 1993 Michael Albert and Noam Chomsky recorded a series of conversations which were

later distributed by <i>Z Magazine</i>. Here we present a transcription of some material from the

1993 tapes, essentially verbatim. Some of the topical material is now historical, of course, but

the rest is as timely as when first discussed.

</TABLE>

</CENTER>





<p><i>You once wrote an essay called &quot;Responsibility and Intellectuals&quot;. Perhaps we

could start by talking a 

little bit about that. First of all, what makes a person an intellectual in the first place. What

is an 

intellectual?</i> </p>

<p>It's not a term I take all that seriously. Some of the most intellectual people I've met and

known in my life 

were very remote from the so-called intellectual professions. Plenty of people who are called

intellectual 

workers, who work with their minds, not their, say, hands, are involved in what amounts to

clerical work. 

An awful lot of academic scholarship, for example, is basically a kind of clerical work. </p>

<p><i>Suppose we use the word positively.</i> </p>

<p>With a positive connotation I would want to talk about whoever it is who's thinking about

things, trying to 

understand things, trying to work things out, maybe trying to articulate and express that

understanding to 

others and so on. That's intellectual life. </p>

<p><i>So &quot;things&quot; could be society, it could be quarks ...</i> </p>

<p>It could be music. </p>

<p><i>It could be sports. So basically, arguably, just about everyone.</i> </p>

<p>Except that an awful lot of the activity of most of us is routine, not considered, not directed

to problems that 

really do concern us and not based on efforts, maybe even opportunities to gain deeper

understanding. </p>

<p><i>So intellectuals have a whole lot of time to do this part of life that we all do some of the

time.</i> </p>

<p>There are people who are privileged enough to be able to spend an awful lot of their time and

effort on these 

things if they so choose. They rarely do. They often do turn to routine kind of hack work, which

is the easy 

way. </p>

<p><i>So supposing a society like ours does give some people the opportunity to spend more time

doing 

intellectual work, then I guess that's the context in which we raise the question, What's the

responsibility 

of a person like that, a person who is free to have that time?</i> </p>

<p>We can distinguish what we you might call their &quot;task&quot; from their moral

responsibility. Their task, that is, the 

reason why social institutions provide them with this time and effort, their task is, say, so that

they can 

support power, authority, they can carry out doctrinal management. They can try to ensure that

others 

perceive the world in a way which is supportive of existing authority and privilege. That's their

task. If they 

stop performing their task, they're likely to be deprived of the opportunities to dedicate

themselves to 

intellectual work. On the other hand, their moral responsibility is quite different, in fact,

almost the opposite. 

Their moral responsibility is to try to understand the truth, to try to work with others to come

to an 

understanding of what the world is like, to try to convey that to other people, help them

understand, and lay 

the basis for constructive action. That's their responsibility. But of course there is a conflict.

If you pursue 

the responsibility, you're likely to be denied the privileges of exercising the intellectual

effort. </p>

<p>It's pretty evident, not hard to understand. If you're a young person, say, in college or in

journalism or for that 

matter a fourth grader, and you have too much of an independent mind, meaning you're beginning to

fulfill 

your responsibility, there is a whole variety of devices that will try to deflect you from that

error and, if you 

can't be controlled, to marginalize and eliminate you some way. In fourth grade you may be a

behavior 

problem. In college you may be irresponsible and erratic and not the right kind of student. If you

make it to 

the faculty you'll fail in what's sometimes called &quot;collegiality,&quot; getting along with

your colleagues. If you're a 

young journalist and you're pursuing stories that the managerial level above you understands,

either 

intuitively or explicitly, are not to be pursued, you can be sent off to the police desk and

advised that you are 

not thinking through properly and how you don't have proper standards of objectivity and so on.

There's a 

range of devices. We live in a free society, so you're not sent to the gas chambers. They don't

send the death 

squads after you, as is commonly done in many countries ... you don't have to go very far away to

see that, 

say in Mexico. But there nevertheless are quite successful devices to ensure that doctrinal

correctness is not 

seriously infringed upon. </p>

<p><i>But certainly intellectuals aren't only journalists, economists, political scientists and

the like. That's one 

set in the social sciences. But then there's also hard scientists. There's biologists and

physicists and the 

like. There it would seem that there's less of a social control problem, and so maybe you get a

different 

kind of behavior. Are the intellectuals in the linguistics department comparable to the

intellectuals in the 

economics department?</i> </p>

<p>First of all, there <i>is</i> a social control problem. It's just that we've transcended it.

Galileo faced it, for 

example. You go back a couple of centuries in the West and the social control problem was very

severe. 

Descartes is alleged to have destroyed the final volume of his treatise on the world, the one that

was 

supposed to deal with the human mind, because he learned of the fate of Galileo. That's something

like the 

death squads. The Inquisition was doing precisely that. Okay, that's past, in the West, at least.

Not 

everywhere. </p>

<p><i>Why is it past? In other words, what is it about a society in the West that enables at least

that kind of 

pursuit of knowledge to be free to go wherever it goes, but not in, say, Moslem society?</i> </p>

<p>There are a number of reasons. One of them is just increase in freedom and enlightenment. We've

become a 

much freer society than we were in absolutist times. Popular struggles over centuries have

enlarged the 

domain of freedom. Intellectuals have often played a role in this, during the Enlightenment, for

example, in 

breaking barriers and creating a space for greater freedom of thought. That often took a lot of

courage and 

quite a struggle. And it goes on until today. But there are other factors, too. It's utilitarian.

It turns out that 

with modern science, especially in the last century or two, the ability to gain deeper

understanding of the 

world has interacted critically with modern economic development, modern power. In fact, the

course of 

science and the course of military endeavors is very close, way back to Archimedes. Archimedes was

after 

all designing devices for military purposes. And military technology and science, their history

closely 

interweaves in the modern period, particularly since the mid-nineteenth century. The sciences have

actually 

begun to contribute materially to industrial development. So there are utilitarian purposes, but I

wouldn't 

overexaggerate them. It's like the kind of result that led to freedom in other domains, like

slavery, let's say. 

Or after a hundred and fifty years of American history women were allowed to vote. Things like

that. These 

are significant. </p>

<p>Back to the point, especially after the great scientific revelations of the seventeenth

century, it got to the point 

where you simply couldn't do science if you were subjected to the doctrinal controls that are

quite effective 

outside the hard sciences. You can't do it. You try to be a physicist after Newton spinning off

ideological 

fanaticism, and you're just out of the game. Progress was too much. It's striking. You can see it

right here in 

Cambridge. I've lived here almost all my adult life. There are two major academic institutions

only a couple 

of miles apart. One of them is science and technology based, MIT. The other has sciences of

course, but the 

tone of it is basically humanities and social sciences, Harvard. And the atmosphere is radically

different. </p>

<p>In fact, there is a funny problem in the natural sciences. That is that there is an internal

conflict. The goal, and 

in fact what you're being paid for, to put is crassly, why you're being given the opportunities,

is to find out 

the truth about the world. And you can't do that under doctrinal constraints. So there's a

tension. On the one 

hand it just <i>has</i> to be free, and it just has to encourage independent thought. On the other

hand, people with 

power and authority want it to be constrained. That contradiction is much more striking in the

natural 

sciences than it is in the social sciences or humanities. You can tell falsehoods forever there.

</p>

<p><i>But that implies that in the social sciences and economics and so on, to be crass, what

they're being paid 

for is not to find the truth but something else.</i> </p>

<p>They are performing their role as long as they provide ideological services. To make it simple,

take, say, 

modern economic theory, with its sort of free-market ideology. Planners in business and government

are not 

going to waste their time following those rules. So the U.S. has a steel industry because it

radically violated 

those rules. It was able to recover its steel industry in the last ten years under allegedly

free-market doctrine 

by barring all imports from abroad, by destroying labor unions, so you could wipe down wages, and

just a 

couple of days ago by slamming tariffs up to over 100% on foreign steel. That's planning. On the

other hand, 

the free-market ideology is very useful. It's a weapon against the general population here because

it's a 

weapon against social spending. It's a weapon against poor people abroad, saying, You guys have to

follow 

these rules. As long as the economists are providing what looks like an intellectual basis for

this ideology, 

they're doing their job. You don't have to pay attention to them for actual planning. You can't do

that with 

physics. </p>

<p><i>How does it happen? Here we have students who finish undergraduate work and decide they want

to be 

an economist. So they go to, let's say, Harvard or MIT or some other school in economics.

Presumably 

when they come in they have some notion of doing something that's relevant to society, to making

life a 

little better, something like that, at least a reasonable number of them. When they come out,

they're 

either going to teach at some small community college or they've learned the correct lesson. But

no one 

gets up in front of the class and says, We will henceforth serve the interests of capital.</i>

</p>

<p>It happens in a lot of ways. Let me tell you a story I once heard from a black civil rights

activist who came 

up to Harvard Law School and was there for a while. This must have been twenty years ago. He once

gave a 

talk and said that kids were coming in to Harvard Law School with long hair and backpacks and

social 

ideals and they were all going to go into public service, law and change the world. That's the

first year. He 

said around April the recruiters come for the summer jobs, the Wall Street firms. Get a cushy

summer job 

and make a ton of money. So the students figure, What the heck? I can put on a tie and jacket and

shave for 

one day, because I need that money and why shouldn't I have it? So they put on a tie and a jacket

for that one 

day and they get the job for the summer. Then they go off for the summer and when they come back

in the fall, 

it's ties and jackets and obedience and a shift of ideology. </p>

<p><i>Sometimes it takes two years.</i> </p>

<p>Sometimes it takes two years; that's overdrawing the point. But those factors are very

influential. I've fought 

it all my life. It's extremely easy to be sucked into the dominant culture. It's very appealing.

And the people 

don't look like bad people. You don't want to sit there and insult them. You try to be friends,

and you are. 

You begin to conform, to adapt, to smooth off the harsher edges. Education at a place like Harvard

is in fact 

largely geared to that, to a remarkable extent. I was a graduate student there. There was an

organization 

called the Society of Fellows, which is a research outfit that selects a couple of people from all

fields over 

the year. It was a remarkable opportunity to work. You had all the facilities of Harvard available

and 

basically no responsibilities. Your only responsibilities were to show up for a dinner every

Monday night 

which was sort of modelled on the Oxford-Cambridge high table. You spent the evening at the dinner

with a 

couple of senior faculty members and other distinguished people. The purpose of that was basically 

socialization. You had to learn how to drink port and how to have polite conversations without

talking about 

serious topics, but of course indicating that you could talk about serious topics if you were so

vulgar as to 

actually do it. There's a whole set of mannerisms. In those days you had to learn how to wear

British clothes. 

That was the appropriate affectation. </p>

<p><i>And it's very rare for a person to do all that and not begin to rationalize and think, This

is really pretty 

good. Aren't I something for all this? And to begin to be impressed</i>. </p>

<p>It kind of seeps in. They've had, for example, back in the early forties ... in the 1930s of

course there was 

pretty big labor strife and labor struggle and it scared the daylights out of the business

community because 

labor was actually winning the right to organize and even legislative victories. There were a lot

of efforts to 

overcome this. Harvard played its role. It introduced a trade union program which brought in

rising young 

people in the labor movement, the guy who looks like he's likely to be the local president next

year. They're 

brought to Harvard, they sit in the business school and the dorms. They go through a socialization

process. 

They're brought to share some of the values and an understanding of the elite. They're taught, our

job is to 

work together. We all are together. There are two lines. One line, for the public, is, we're all

together. We're 

all cooperating, joint enterprise, harmony and so on. Of course, meanwhile, business is fighting a

vicious 

class struggle on the side, but that's in a different corner of the universe. That effort to

socialize and integrate 

union activists, I've never measured its success, but I'm sure it was successful. It's pretty much

the way what 

I experienced and saw what a Harvard education. There's much less of that at MIT, naturally, for

exactly the 

reason you said: They're not training the people who are going to rule. </p>

<p><i>It reminds me of 180 degrees opposite, when people started to become politicized in the

early and 

mid-sixties there was an intellectual component that was trying to understand society. There was a

whole 

set of lifestyle acts, ranging from long hair to having a mattress on the floor to various other

kinds of 

behavioral traits. Most parents were sophisticated enough to get much more upset about the

lifestyle acts 

than about the ideas that were being phrased. Because they had a tremendous tenacity. Once you had

a 

community that had these lifestyle ways of behaving and ways of getting along and ways of

identifying 

one another and being part of the same thing, you could escape the more mainstream behaviorisms

far 

more easily. You could look at the accepted roles as being silly or false or whatever, and it was

no longer 

so attractive. That has been absent since about 1970. I don't think the left has had anything much

to 

compete with, the sort of general life definitions of the mainstream and the right. So o the left

you don't 

have a strong lifestyle and an identity to make it easy to ignore the seductions. What you have is

ideals 

but no counteridentity.</i> </p>

<p>That's partly because the alternative lifestyle simply was commercialized and absorbed into the

mainstream 

culture, selling clothes and that sort of thing. </p>

<p><i>That was part of it. It was also partly because the alternative lifestyle was never the

wonderful lifestyle it 

was cut out to be. Instead of defining something positively, it was defined as the opposite of

what is. The 

opposite of something that's horrible isn't always so wonderful. So there were many components of

the 

way we lived and acted in the late sixties that were not very well conceived as ways to live and

act over a 

long period of time. They worked for a time, but over the longer haul they often just weren't very 

fulfilling.</i> </p>

<p>What you're saying is no doubt true. The thing has been commercialized and cheapened. Still,

life's a lot 

easier than it was forty years ago. If I think back to those days, if I look at pictures from the

early 1960s, I 

can hardly believe it, how disciplined everything was, how deep the authority structures were just

in 

personal relations, the way you looked and talked when you went out with your friends. There's

been very 

significant ... I think very good changes as a result of what took place in the 1960s that in turn

spread around 

the whole society. Maybe the spread of some of the gains meant that young dissidents couldn't

identify 

themselves so easily, but it's in part because the society got better. </p>

<p><i>But it's distracting and sort of disturbing. I mean, it's true, and when I talk to students

I try to convey the 

difference between a time when everybody thought that every lawyer was honest and forthright and 

deserved obedience and so on and that doctors were out for nothing except to help humanity, that 

business people cared about consumers, and so on, to a time, now, when people know much more than 

that, to a time, now, when people are sort of passive and laid back. But then it's distracting

that with 

those changes you don't have a parallel change in an organized and aware, self-conscious and

critically 

aware left. On the one hand we do have a lot of left activists. But we don't have something that

is a 

national left.</i> </p>

<p>I agree with you, of course. But it seems to me what's happened, as I try to understand what's

happened since 

the sixties, is that there has been among the general population, excluding those who are

considered 

responsible intellectuals, meaning the ones filling their tasks, excluding power structures and

the 

intellectuals who serve their interests, for the general population, there has been something of

almost a 

revolutionary change in moral values and cultural level and so on, and a great improvement. It has

taken no 

institutional form at all. On the one hand, the ideological institutions are firmly in the hands

of the extremely 

narrow liberal-to-reactionary spectrum, and very tightly controlled. There's no identifiable point

of view or 

ways of thinking or by and large even journals outside them, very little. On the other hand, the

general 

population has become extremely dissident and has absorbed many of the values that people were

struggling 

for in the sixties, and you can see it in just about every area. </p>

<p><i>But the thing that seems to be missing is that then people thought that you could win a

change.</i> </p>

<p>I think they <i>did</i> win a change. </p>

<p><i>Yes, but it was in considerable part because they also believed they could, understood they

could. But 

now people tend not to believe they can, and so have little incentive to try.</i> </p>

<p>I don't think they've recognized what changes are already achieved. If you take almost any area

you think of, 

whether it's race or sex or military intervention, the environment--these are all areas of

awareness and 

concern that didn't exist in the early sixties. You didn't even think about them. You just

submitted, without 

even knowing that you were submitting. You just accepted. And people don't any more. Take the

original sin 

of American history: what happened to the native population. It's a remarkable fact that until the

1960s the 

culture simply couldn't come to terms with it. Not at all. When I grew up, I would go out with my

friends and 

we'd play cowboys and Indians and shoot the Indians. Scholarship was the same. Until the 1960s,

with very 

rare exceptions, academic scholarship was grossly falsifying the history, suppressing the reality

of what 

happened. Even the number of people was radically falsified. As late as 1969, in one of the

leading 

diplomatic histories of the United States, the author Thomas Wally could write that after the

Revolution &quot;the 

colonists turned to the task of felling trees and Indians.&quot; Nobody could say that now. You

couldn't even say 

that in a <i>Wall Street Journal</i> editorial. Those are really important changes. </p>

<p><i>But somehow it's as if, in a phrase I once heard, we snatched defeat from the jaws of

victory. People have 

this perception of accomplishing nothing or very, very little, and begin to get burned out and to

retain 

some of the values and commitments but begin to feel that you can no longer really struggle for

change 

bcause we're not succeeding. This is a common sentiment. It's certainly a common sentiment among 

people I know, not always voiced, I think, but there. And yet if you look objectively at the

thing, like 

you're trying to do now, you see that if you don't have an outrageously inflated view of how fast

change 

takes place, then you can understand that change has been dramatic. It isn't so obvious what the 

mechanism is that causes people to be so oblivious to their own effects.</i> </p>

<p>Partly it's that there's nothing in the official culture that's ever going to tell you you

succeeded. It's always 

going to tell you you failed. The official view of the sixties is it's a bunch of crazies running

around burning 

down universities and making noise because they were hysterics or were afraid to go to Vietnam or 

something. That's the official story. That's what people hear. They may know in their lives and

experience 

that that's not what happened. But they don't hear anybody say it, unless they're in activist

groups. That 

change is possible, that it has been won, is not the message that the system is pouring into you

through 

television and radio and newspapers and books and histories and so on. It's sort of beating into

your head 

another story. The other story is you failed, and you should have failed, because you were just a

bunch of 

crazies. And it's natural that the official culture should take that view. It does not want people

to understand 

that you can make changes. That's the last thing it wants people to understand. So, what the

mainstream media 

conveys is that if there have been changes, it's because we, the elites, are so great that we

carried through the 

changes. </p>

<p><i>But there's an element of truth in that, though perverse. Of course, short of a revolution

any change that 

occurs is going to occur how? Immediately, because an elite makes a decision to enact a change.

They're 

going to make the decision because of the pressures of social movements. But they are in a

position to 

deny the influence of the movements and claim credit for themselves down the road a ways.</i> </p>

<p>But really, they bowed to pressures. </p>

<p><i>That's right. When you read the histories, they don't talk about the pressures from social

movements. 

Instead elites simply talk about their profound wisdom in taking this next step.</i> </p>

<p>We ended slavery because we were such great figures that we decided that we didn't like

slavery. </p>

<p><i>And the real cause of it is gone.</i> </p>

<p>Let's say the slave revolts. </p>

<p><i>That's gone</i>. </p>

<p>And sure, we saw that on a not trivial scale in the last thirty years. So this combination of a

kind of a, in my 

opinion, really close to revolutionary change in moral values and cultural level has gone on

without any 

lasting institutional change. </p>

<p>And the lack of institutional support for the changes in ideas and values allows the official

culture to drive 

home its message, which is, you guys are worthless and can't do anything, why don't you just shut

up and go 

home? And steadily they undermine the progress. </p>

<p><i>I want to go into some of that when we talk about movements and what should happen. But

let's just go 

back to this broad question of intellectuals. What about left intellectuals? If an intellectual is

somebody 

who spends time trying to understand, and a social intellectual tries to understand society,

what's a left 

intellectual? Are there any?</i> </p>

<p>I've never been very happy about words like &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right,&quot; but let's

use it in the conventional sense. One 

of the very few predictions in the social sciences that I know of that ever came true was one of

Bakunin's 

over a century ago in which he talked about what the intellectuals were going to be like in modern

industrial 

society. He predicted that they would fall into two categories. There would be the left

intellectual. They 

would be the ones who would try to rise to power on the backs of mass popular movements, and if

they 

could gain power they would then beat the people into submission. </p>

<p><i>Leninism.</i> </p>

<p>Yes, what he was predicting was Leninism. And if the inelletuals find that they can't do that,

or that it is too 

dangerous or costly, they'll be the servants of what we would nowadays call state capitalism. He

didn't use 

the term. Either of the two intellectuals, he said, will be &quot;beating the people with the

people's stick.&quot; That is, 

they will still be presenting themselves as representatives of the people, so they'll hold the

people's stick, 

but they'll be beating the people with it. He didn't go on with this, but I think that his

analysis has turned out 

to be true. And it follows from his analysis that it would likely be extremely easy to shift from

one position 

to the other. It's extremely easy, that is, to undergo what nowadays is called the

&quot;God-that-failed&quot; syndrome. 

You start off as basically a Leninist, someone who is going to be part of the Red bureaucracy. You

see later 

that power doesn't lie that way, and you very quickly become an ideologist of the right and you

devote your 

life to exposing the sins of your former comrades who haven't seen the light and haven't shifted

to where 

power really is. In fact, we're seeing it right now in the Soviet Union. The same guys who were

Communist 

thugs, Stalinist thugs two years back, are now running banks and enthusiastic free marketeers and

praising 

Americans. </p>

<p><i>It doesn't take a long indoctrination period to learn the new style.</i> </p>

<p>And this has been going on for forty years. It's become a kind of a joke. Where does that leave

what you 

might call &quot;honest intellectuals&quot;? They're usually outside the system, for good reasons.

There is no reason to 

expect institutions of power and domination to tolerate people trying to undermine them. Quite the

opposite. 

So therefore you quite typically find the honest and serious intellectuals, people who are

commited to, I 

think, enlightenment values, values of truth, freedom, liberty, and justice, there would be major

efforts made 

to marginalize them. </p>

<p><i>Who are they?</i> </p>

<p>All the people who have done anything that's ... </p>

<p><i>Who, which people, groups?</i> </p>

<p>Take, say, the SNCC activists. They were serious intellectuals. They made a big change in the

world. The 

people of your generation, who did the work that led to the changes we spoke of earlier... work

that didn't 

just mean running around the streets waving signs. It also meant thinking about things and

figuring out what 

the problems were. Those people made a change. A certain number of them did filter their way into

the 

institutions. For example, if you take universities or newspapers or television today, you usually

find people 

in there, almost always, who have been through those experiences and have remained true to them.

They've 

got to adapt their behavior in various ways to get by. But many of them do it very

self-consciously, very 

honestly and even very constructively. So there's a kind of an honest intelligentsia if you like,

meaning not 

serving power, either as Red bureaucracy or as state capitalist, commissar equivalents. Such

people exist, 

sometimes in the institutions, but most of the time out of them, for almost trivial reasons. The

institutions are 

simply not going to welcome serious critics. They're constructed in such a way as to make it

difficult or 

impossible for people who are going to undermine those institutions to survive. How could it be

otherwise? 

It's just like you're not going to find a militant labor activist as chairman of the board of

General Electric. 

How could it be? </p>

<p><i>It seems straightforward to me as well. But we come to the question, are there some left

intellectuals who 

rise to a position of relative prominence, so they're visible. SNCC activists are anonymous, in a

sense, 

socially anonymous.</i> </p>

<p>They're marginalized, but they're important. Some of them are still around, doing important

things. </p>

<p><i>But in a sense it's an activist group who is not highlighted and made publicly visible. And

some leaders 

might be.</i> </p>

<p>Like Rosa Luxemburg, say, who got killed. </p>

<p><i>Right. So there's a figure in history who we could say, She's one of the people who I would

pick...</i> </p>

<p>She was murdered. That's the point. </p>

<p><i>Typical. This raises the question, Can we only find dead ...?</i> </p>

<p>No. First of all, if you look back through history ... </p>

<p><i>Let's look now.</i> </p>

<p>Now? You find people all over. It's claimed now that there's less of a left intelligentsia than

there was thirty 

years ago. I don't believe a word of it. Take a look at the people who they're calling the left,

the big thinkers 

of the 1950s. Who were they? They were intelligent people. Ed Wilson is an intelligent person, but

a left 

intellectual? Mary McCarthy? A smart person who wrote some nice novels. But not a left

intellectual. In 

fact, what you have now is much more serious activists in many more places. I travel all the time

and give 

talks all over the place. I've been amazed to go to places throughout the 1980s ... take, say, the

Central 

America solidarity movement, which I think is a pretty dramatic development. I don't think there's

been 

anything like it in history. I'd go to a church in Kansas or a town in Montana or Wyoming or

Anchorage, 

Alaska and find people who knew more about Latin America, certainly, than the CIA, which is not

very hard, 

but people in academic departments who've thought about it, who understood things about American

policy. </p>

<p>I can't even tell you their names. There are too many of them. Also, I'm not even sure that the

word &quot;left&quot; is 

the right word for them. A lot of them were probably Christian conservatives, but they were very

radical 

people in my view. Intellectuals who understood and who did a lot. They created a popular movement

which 

not only protested U.S. atrocities but actually engaged themselves in the lives of the victims. In

the 1960s 

nobody ever dreamt of going off to a Vietnamese village because maybe a white face in the village

would 

limit the capacity of the marauders to kill and destroy. That wasn't even an idea in your head. In

fact, nobody 

even went to try to report the war from the side of the victims. It was unheard of, save for a few

&quot;crazies.&quot; 

But in the eighties it was common. And the people who were doing that are serious left

intellectuals, in my 

view. </p>

<p><i>So if a person comes along and says the left intellectual community is gutted, there's very

little of it, what 

they must in fact be saying is something like--the number of people who call themselves leftist

and who 

are visibly notable is small. Which, of course, in your analysis may well be an indication that

there's a 

growing left intellectual community which is, of course, being isolated and not labeled anything

publicly 

and not given any public visibility.</i> </p>

<p>That's right. What will be labeled &quot;left&quot; and given publicity is something ugly

enough that people can be 

rallied to oppose it. So Stalinism, for example. Books will come out, and are coming out, about

the left 

intellectuals in France who were Stalinists. And look at the awful things they did. That kind of

left 

intelligentsia is allowed to have publicity and prominence. They give them as much prominence as

they can. </p>

<p><i>It's useful.</i> </p>

<p>But if by left you mean people who are struggling for peace and justice and freedom and human

rights and so 

on, and for social change and elimination of authority structures, whether it's personal life or

institutions or 

whatever, if that's what the left is, there are more of them around than I remember in my

lifetime. </p>

<p><i>In coming to this kind of perception of the thing, you have a real advantage, you

personally, relatively 

speaking. You personally, as compared to one of those individuals, do have a lot of the visibility

and a lot 

of the access that somebody might attribute as the critical ingredient needed to impact on a wide 

audience in our society. These other people feel isolated. They feel relatively uninfluential or

unable to 

express their opinions to a wider audience.</i> </p>

<p>Visibility, that's putting the cart before the horse. The reason I have visibility is because

there are a lot of 

people around, a lot of groups around, who come and ask me to speak, or because people ask me to

write. I 

don't have visibility in the mainstream institutions. </p>

<p><i>But there has to be a distinction between you and those people you mentioned in Omaha or

Anchorage or 

wherever who may know more than you, or at least a lot, about Central America and who are never

asked 

to speak.</i> </p>

<p>We pick different ways of living our lives. In the early sixties, I was an MIT professor. But

when I started 

giving talks about the war or organizing tax resistance or getting involved in the foundation of

RESIST, 

national resistance support groups, or being faculty advisor for the Rosa Luxemburg SDS at MIT, I

didn't 

have any visibility. There are choices to be made. Some of my close friends who have the same

status and 

chance for visibility that I had actually picked a different way and devoted their lives to

organizing and 

activism. Louis Kampf and I are old friends. We taught courses together for years at MIT, courses

which you 

took years ago. We just went different ways. He devoted himself primarily to real activism and

organizing 

and keeping groups and journals functioning and so on. I tried that and I wasn't any good at it. I

found that I 

was much better at other things, and that there seemed to be a demand for the other things, so I

just went that 

way. That ends up in me being visible. He's visible in other circles than the ones that I'm

visible in. But 

those are just different ways of reacting to the same sorts of problems, depending on your

personality and 

your particular abilities and the kinds of things you can do and the kinds of things you can't do

and so on and 

so forth. The visibility is a surface phenomenon. Visibility is the result of the existence of an

active, lively 

left. If what I've been talking about as the left were to disappear, I would no longer be visible.

</p>

<p><i>As a political commentator.</i> </p>

<p>Yes, I could still appear in linguistics and philosophy meetings, but I would certainly not be

visible as a 

political commentator, because there would be nowhere for me to open my mouth except to my

friends. It 

would be back to the early sixties, when I could talk to people in the living room. The reason

that it has 

changed is because there are opportunities that in fact call for this kind of participation, so

that makes people 

look visible. We mentioned SNCC before. Why did Martin Luther King become visible? Because there

were 

SNCC workers down in the South. And he could appear and serve a role for them. </p>

<p><i>It seems to me there is a positive and negative side to that. The positive side you've

described: there's a 

political context and it draws people in different ways and people participate. But the negative

side 

seems to me to be, you gave the example of Martin Luther King and yourself. There's a need for a 

particular visible organizer or a particular visible speaker and proselytizer of information, a

presenter 

of information. But once those slots are filled, then there's a tendency for people to cling to

the 

individuals who are filling those slots. For a long period of time, depending on a number of

factors, the 

number of slots might not broaden out. Nowadays if a group in Cleveland or in San Francisco or 

wherever wants an antiwar speaker during the Gulf crisis or wants a speaker about foreign policy,

very 

few names pop into mind. Whereas I think you're right, there is a much larger circuit of people, 

especially if they had the experience of engaging in those activities, who could fill the bill.

That seems to 

me to be not so positive a dynamic.</i> </p>

<p>It's not. It's hard to break through. There are people who we know in fact who are highly

qualified to do lots 

of things and are eager to do it but sort of can't pass over that barrier. I don't know exactly

what the reason 

for that is, frankly, because all of us had to pass over that barrier at some point. Part of the

reason is, the fact 

of the matter is there haven't been a lot of people available. Take, say, the last ten years, when

there's been a 

lot of activism, a lot of it having to do with Latin America. There just haven't been a lot of

people around 

who were willing to go and give talks. There are plenty of people who are willing to write

articles on 

postmodernism and the left this and that or whatever, but not many who are willing to go to a town 

somewhere and give a talk at a meeting. We can name them. </p>

<p><i>Or we can name the ones we know, but it may well be there are a good many more and we can't

name 

them. That's the problem.</i> </p>

<p>There are a good many more who would be highly qualified and maybe even would like to do it.

The 

question we're asking, and I don't know what the answer is, is how come they don't. First of all,

I don't think 

it's all that hard. Take, say, people who weren't known very well, like Holly Sklar, who probably

wasn't 

known fifteen years ago. She got plenty of invitations all over the place. She became visible.

There are 

others like her. Take my friend Norman Finkelstein on the Middle East. He can get plenty of

invitations to 

speak. He's been totally shut out of the institutions, but he's visible if he wants. It can be

done. It's not so 

simple. </p>

<p><i>It's somewhat difficult. I do think that there's a dynamic there that closes it off.</i>

</p>

<p>The bad dynamic, what you're pointing to, is the &quot;star story. It's standard when a popular

movement takes off 

for people to show up and say, OK, I'm your leader. A Eugene McCarthy type, say. Here's a big

popular 

movement. Fine. I'm your leader. Give me power. If you can't give me power I'll go home and write

poetry 

and talk about baseball. And if you can give me power then I become your leader and now you look

up to me 

and you go home and put the power in my hand. That's a familiar dynamic, and Bakunin's Red

bureaucracy, 

no matter what its politics are. It could be right wing, it could be left wing. But there's a

better dynamic, 

which is that the popular movements continue and strengthen, and where there are people around

who, for 

whatever reason or quirk or privilege or whatever it may be, can contribute to them by

intellectual activity, 

they do a part of it. That's all. They're not stars. They're not leaders. They're just

contributing in the way that 

they know how to contribute. That would be a better structure. But it can tend to degenerate into

this other 

very quickly, especially in a culture which is reinforcing their worst tendencies by trying to

create an 

imagery of leadership and stars and heroes and so on. </p>

<p><i>Suppose somebody could convince you, at the level of your belief in most things, that 

it's impossible to change the country. Suppose they convinced you that the basic 

institutional structure that we have now is going to be in place for the next two 

hundred years, adapted sure, but the basic structures as they are. Would you behave 

any differently?</i> </p>

<p>Zero. </p>

<p><i>You would behave exactly the same way.</i> </p>

<p>The same way. In fact, you don't even have to make it hypothetical. When I got 

seriously involved in anti-Vietnam War activities, I was a hundred percent convinced 

that absolutely nothing could be done, and there was plenty of reason to believe 

that. I was giving plenty of talks, but they were usually in living rooms to a group 

of neighbors that somebody would get together. They were usually pretty hostile. Or 

in a church where there would be four people including some guy who wandered in 

because he didn't know what to do, and two people who wanted to kill you, and the 

organizer. Into 1965 and 1966, if we wanted to have at MIT an antiwar meeting, we 

would have to find six topics. Let's talk about Venezuela, Iran, Vietnam and the 

price of bread, and maybe we can get an audience that will outnumber the organizers. 

And that went on for a long time. As you well remember, it was impossible to have a 

public meeting in Boston without it being smashed up. It looked impossible. </p>

<p><i>If you thought this was going to continue forever, you would still do it. I think it 

would be useful to explain why. </i></p>

<p>A number of quite simple reasons. For one thing, if somebody convinced me, it would 

be because I'm totally irrational. There's no way you could convince anybody of such 

things rationally. We cannot predict the weather two weeks ahead, and we even 

understand why we can't. </p>

<p><i>It's a hypothetical question. It gets to motivations. Obviously neither one of us 

believe it, and neither one of us believe you could prove it. You couldn't convince 

anybody rational of it.</i> </p>

<p>You couldn't say anything convincing about it. </p>

<p><i>Nevertheless, supposing because a great many people not understanding that point, do 

feel this way or tend to feel this way sometimes and get depressed at moments. The 

question is, in any event, what gets you up each morning to do the things that you 

do? Is it that you think in terms of winning a little ways down the road, or is it 

something else?</i> </p>

<p>It's hard to introspect, but to the extent that I introspect about it, it's because 

you basically have two choices. One choice is to assume the worst, and then you can 

be guaranteed that it will happen. The other is to assume that there is hope for 

change, and then it's possible that by acting you will help effect change. So you've 

got two choices. One guarantees that the worst will happen. The other leaves open the 

possibility that things might be better. Given those two choices, a rational person 

doesn't hesitate. </p>

<p><i>I used to think about this back when I was becoming political, in the mid-sixties. I 

played the hypothetical game a little more fairly than I think you are right now. I 

said to myself, OK, suppose it's haves and have-nots. Not very many haves, a whole 

lot of have-nots. Forever. Which side do you want to be on? And it's not an easy 

question. At the time it was trivial. In the sixties, that was an easy question to 

answer. You wanted to be on the side of the have-nots regardless of prospects. I 

think this had a lot to do with lifestyle and values and who you identify with. The 

other stuff, being a have, just wasn't attractive. Now I think it's a much harder 

question. But that's one kind of motivation that people can have for being radical. 

The other kind of motivation that people can have for being radical is the 

inclination that you're going to win tomorrow or in your lifetime or in a reasonable 

span of time. It seems like the first motivation breeds a different kind of person in 

some sense than the second. They're called purists, morally motivated, ethically 

motivated, and scorned a bit by some of the other types, with some reason. 

Because--and this was the other thing that I began to realize early on--trying to 

make social change isn't like trying to play socialist basketball. In working for 

social change, the score counts. It doesn't do to play well or congenially but lose. 

The combination of both of those motivations--scorning being a have but also 

seriously wanting to win--in one person seems to me to be rather difficult.</i> </p>

<p>You mentioned two possibilities. One is a description of your own group's experience 

in the sixties. You didn't expect to win a huge victory tomorrow. Some people 

expected we'll go out and strike at Columbia ... And everybody will love each other 

and that's the end of power. We both know perfectly well that plenty of people 

believed that. There were other people who recognized it was going to be a long 

struggle but who were joining with like-minded people who shared their cultural 

values and their lifestyle and everything else. There's also a third type: You've got 

me. I was not part of the cultural scene. I certainly didn't expect a quick victory. 

I kept my old-fashioned bourgeois lifestyle, and I haven't changed it to this day. 

And there are people like that too. If we go on there are many more types of people. 

People can come in a lot of varieties. But it seems to me that it always comes down 

to the individual decision: What am I going to do? Here are my options. Of course, my 

personal options are broader than those of most other people, because I happen to be 

very privileged. But everybody's got some option. You ask yourself, Will I not use 

them at all? In which case I can be sure that suffering will continue and oppression 

will continue and discrimination will continue and get worse. Or will I use whatever 

options I have, try to work with others to change things? In which case things may 

get better. It seems to me that ultimately that's what things come down to, no matter 

who we are. And given those choices, a decent person is only going to go one way. 

That's exactly why society and the official culture doesn't want you to understand 

that you have those choices. </p>

<p><i>Is that true that a decent person's only going to go one way? I'm remembering a 

friend of mine who was an organizer in the sixties. We went through the antiwar 

movement. Then came a little bit further along and there was a trend toward doing 

community organizing, moving into a neighborhood, trying to organize people in that 

neighborhood. This individual was going to move into a neighborhood in Dorchester, in 

Boston, a working-class area and try and do organizing. He finally decided not to do 

it and somewhat later went back to graduate school and then became a psychiatrist and 

now, I'm sure, has progressive values at some level--I haven't seen him in years and 

years--but is certainly not involved in any significant way in political activity. 

The choice that he made was a very self-conscious one. He looked around him and he 

said, the impact that I personally am going to have is so small because I'm not so 

and so or so and so, he'd name some other people who had prospects of maybe in his 

eyes having more impact, because of whatever set of factors about, so that it simply 

isn't worth giving up what I think I'm giving up.</i> </p>

<p>I don't know who you mean, but I know plenty of people like that. That person now, 

let's say he's a rich psychiatrist somewhere ... </p>

<p><i>He's probably reasonably well off.</i> </p>

<p>He's got a lot of options. For example, he's got money. </p>

<p><i>This is like a person going to Harvard Law School. The probability that he'll do 

something good with his income after the years of earning it...</i> </p>

<p>I agree. But he's simply deciding at some point not to face the options. He's always 

got them. He may decide, Look, I can't make enough of a change myself because I'm not 

good at it or whatever, so I'm just going to do what I like and enrich myself. But 

having done so, you still have plenty of options available. In fact, movement groups 

have existed in part because people who were doing other things were willing to fund 

them. Something as trivial as that. You can go way beyond that, of course, and still 

live your elegant lifestyle and do the work you want. We know people who have divided 

their lives that way. Of course it's extremely easy to say, the heck with it. I'm 

just going to adapt myself to the structures of power and authority and do the best I 

can within them. Sure, you can do that. But that's not acting like a decent person. 

You can walk down the street and be hungry. You see a kid eating an ice cream cone 

and you notice there's no cop around and you can take the ice cream cone from him 

because you're bigger and walk away. You can do that. Probably there are people who 

do. We call them &quot;pathological.&quot; On the other hand, if they do it within existing 

social structures we call them &quot;normal.&quot; But it's just as pathological. It's just the 

pathology of the general society. And people, again, always have choices. We're free 

people. You can decide to accept that pathology, but then do it honestly, at least, 

if you have that grain of honesty to say, I'm going to honestly be pathological. Or 

else try to break out of it somehow. </p>

<p><i>But for a lot of people I think it appears that there's an all-or-nothing choice. It 

appears that there's the choice of being normal--pathological as you describe, but a 

normal member of society with its normal benefits and costs and so on, but at least a 

reasonably average or perhaps elite existence that's accepted. Then there seems to be 

another &quot;all&quot; choice, to be a raging revolutionary. The reason why it's so hard for 

many people even just to take a leaflet from a protester, or to give a donation at a 

relatively low level which means nothing financially, which is less money than 

they're going to spend on dinner on Friday night when they go out, or to do some 

other act that is materially trivial, seems to be because there's a psychologically 

really powerful effect. The effect seems to me to be that at some level people know 

that to dissent is right, and at some level people know that to do it somewhat leads 

to doing it still more, so they defensively close the door right at the very 

beginning. They have a very hard time finding a place in that span of possible 

involvement that allows them to be a functioning human being with a degree of 

fulfillment in society and also lets them contribute to dramatically changing 

society.</i> </p>

<p>You're right. Just giving your contribution of $100 to the Central America support 

center or whatever is a statement that you know that that's the right thing to do. 

Once you've stated it's the right thing to do, how come I'm only doing this limited 

thing since I could do a million times more? It's easier to say, I'm not going to 

face that problem at all. I'm just going to forget it entirely. But that's like 

stealing the ice cream cone from the kid. </p>

<p><i>But it says something to the left, or to movements and to organizers. It is at some 

level unreasonable to think that in the absence of hope or in the presence only of 

small hope and not a clear understanding of how one's going to make progress, that 

people are going to shift all the way from being average, normal, everyday folks of 

one type or another over to being political revolutionaries, people who see things in 

political terms. If there's no set of choices in the middle that are comfortable and 

that allow people to operate and to retain some of their lifestyle, then it's not 

likely that too many are going to do anything. You almost have to be religious to 

make the jump.</i> </p>

<p>But the reality is there's a whole range of choices in the middle. </p>

<p><i>But people don't see them.</i> </p>

<p>And all of us have made them. None of us are saints, at least I'm not. I haven't 

given up my house, my car, I don't live in a hovel. I don't spent 24 hours a day 

working for the benefit of the human race or anything like that. I don't even come 

close. I spend an awful lot of my time and energy ... </p>

<p><i>And you don't feel guilty about whatever else is it that you're doing, linguistics or 

...</i> </p>

<p>That's not so clear. But at least I certainly devote an awful lot of my energy and 

activity to things that I just enjoy, like scientific work. I just like it. I do it 

out of pleasure. And everybody else I know ... </p>

<p><i>Do you fool yourself into believing that doing that increases your effectiveness as a 

political person?</i> </p>

<p>No, that's ridiculous. It has no effect on it. And I don't do it for that reason. I 

like it. I mean, I can make up a story ... </p>

<p><i>I think people have a hard time doing this. And that's why a lot of people do nothing 

politically dissident.</i> </p>

<p>That's true, but if we were to go back to that small class of people who are visible, 

every one of them does this. Every single one. </p>

<p><i>Almost by definition.</i> </p>

<p>Because you're not going to be effective as a political activist unless you have a 

satisfying life. There may be people who are really saints. I've never heard of one. </p>

<p><i>By definition they're not saints, because they're getting so much satisfaction out of 

the political activity, they're not saintly at it.</i> </p>

<p>Not from the political activity. It may be that the political activities themselves 

are so gratifying that's all you want to do, so you throw yourself into that. That's 

a perfectly fine thing to be. It's just that most people have other interests. They 

want to listen to music. They want to take a walk by the ocean. Any human being is 

too rich and complex to be just satisfied with these things. You have to hit some 

kind of a balance. The choices are all there. And I think you've identified precisely 

why it's psychologically difficult for people to recognize that choices are there. 

Because once you recognize that the choices are there, you're always going to be 

faced with the question, why am I not doing more? But that's the reality of life. If 

you're honest, you're always going to be faced with those questions. And there's 

plenty to do. In fact, if you look back over the last period, there's a lot of 

successes to point to. It's amazing how many successes there are if you really think 

about it. Take something which very few people have been interested in. Take the 

issue of East Timor, the massacre. I got involved in that about fifteen years ago. 

People didn't even want to hear about it. Things finally got to the point where the 

U.S. Congress barred military aid to Indonesia. That's a tremendous change. You could 

save hundreds of thousands of lives that way. How many people can look back and say, 

Look, I helped save hundreds of thousands of lives? And that's one tiny issue. </p>

<p><i>I'm inclined to think that most of the people who are involved in that effort, 

instead of feeling elated or feeling at least a degree of satisfaction over their 

accomplishment, rather probably view it as a horrendously long campaign with very 

little achieved. It's like looking at the milk glass and saying it's half empty 

instead of half full. Except we see it empty even when it's almost full.</i> </p>

<p>Suppose you're on your deathbed. How many people can look back and say, I've 

contributed to helping ... just one person not get killed? </p>

<p><i>I'm not disagreeing with you. I think you're right, clearly. But there's something 

that causes people, maybe it's something about our culture, to not see it.</i> </p>

<p>I'm not so convinced of this. The sixties movements, roughly speaking, were almost 

overwhelmingly young people. Young people have a notoriously short perspective. It's 

part of being twenty years old. You don't think what's going to happen tomorrow. I've 

seen it around students, around children, even. I remember myself. You don't think 

what's life going to be like twenty years from now. Your perspective is short. The 

fact that it was a youth movement dominantly had good and bad aspects. One bad aspect 

was this sense that if we don't achieve gains quickly we might as well quit. But of 

course that's not the way changes come. The struggle against slavery, let's say, went 

on forever. The struggle for women's rights has been going on for a century. The 

effort to overcome wage slavery, that's been going on since the beginnings of the 

Industrial Revolution, and we haven't advanced an inch. In fact, we are worse off 

than a hundred years ago in terms of understanding the issues. Well, OK, you just 

keep struggling. </p>

<p><i>Let's go back to one of the things that you mentioned along the way when you were 

talking about academics and what role they play and what they're doing and what their 

time goes to. You brought up briefly in passing postmodernism and these various 

other--either you can call them insightful forays into knowledge, or fads. I know, 

and probably most people listening know, at least somewhat, about your reaction to 

it. But let's go over it anyway. Where does it come from? Why does a person who has a 

tremendous amount of educational background, knowledge, experience, time to 

spend--spend it on something akin to astrology?</i> </p>

<p>I don't want to overgeneralize. I think there is important and insightful work done 

in those frameworks. I find it really hard to figure out because I've got to labor to 

try to tease the simple, interesting points out. But there are things there. I think 

we're making progress there. But I think there's a point that's much more general. 

The fact is, it's extremely hard to have good ideas. There are very few of them 

around. If you're in the sciences, you know you can sometimes come up with something 

that's pretty startling and it's usually something that's small in comparison with 

what's known and you're really excited about it. Outside the natural sciences it's 

extremely hard to do even that. There just isn't that much that's complicated that's 

at all understood outside of pretty much the core natural sciences. Everything else 

is either too hard for us to understand or pretty easy. </p>

<p><i>So suppose you're making $50,000 a year as a academic in that field?</i> </p>

<p>You've got to have a reason for your existence. The result is that simple ideas are 

dressed up in extremely complex terminology and frameworks. In part it's just 

careerism, or maybe an effort to build self-respect. Take, say, what's called 

&quot;literary theory.&quot; I don't think there's any such thing as literary theory, any more 

than there's cultural theory. </p>

<p><i>And obviously you can read a book and talk about it.</i> </p>

<p>Yeah, if you're reading books and talking about them and getting people to ... </p>

<p><i>You could be very good at that.</i> </p>

<p>You could be terrific at it. Take, say, Edmund Wilson. He's terrific at it. But he 

doesn't have a literary theory. On the other hand, if you want to be in the same room 

with that physicist over there who's talking about quarks, you better have a 

complicated theory, too, that nobody can understand. He has a theory that nobody can 

understand, so why shouldn't I have a theory that nobody can understand? </p>

<p><i>The interesting thing is that the physicist will write about that theory in a popular 

book and explain it without a whole lot of rigmarole. It won't all be explained, but 

a great deal of it will be.</i> </p>

<p>A great physicist of the modern period could write a book that you could give to your 

twelve-year-old kid and she'll understand it and learn something from it. In fact, I 

see it myself all the time. </p>

<p><i>What's the reason why literary theorists can't do that? Is it because there's nothing 

there?</i> </p>

<p>That's my assumption. Either there's something there that's so deep that it's a kind 

of qualitative change in human intelligence, or there isn't a lot there. And it's not 

just literary theory. If somebody came along with a theory of history, it would be 

the same. &quot;Theory&quot; would be a sort of truism. Maybe &quot;smart ideas.&quot; Somebody

could 

have smart ideas and say, Why don't you look at class struggle? It's interesting. Or, 

Why don't you look at economic factors lying behind the Constitution? Pick your 

topic. Those are interesting smart ideas. But you can say them in monosyllables. And 

it's rare outside the natural sciences to find things that can't be said in 

monosyllables. There are interesting, simple ideas. They're often hard to come up 

with, and they're often extremely hard to work out. Like you want to try to 

understand what actually happened, say, in the modern industrial economy and how it 

developed the way it is. That can take a lot of work. But there isn't going to be 

anything too complex to talk about ... the theory will be extremely thin, if by 

&quot;theory&quot; we mean something with principles which are not obvious when you look at 

them from which you can deduce surprising consequences, check out the consequences, 

and then confirm the principles. You're not going to find anything like that. </p>

<p><i>So we can imagine two libraries, a library of literary theory books, postmodernism 

and so on, and another library over here with Marxist/Leninist books in essentially 

the same building.</i> </p>

<p>I don't understand that either. I read all kinds of things which talk about 

dialectical materialism. I haven't the foggiest idea what it is. </p>

<p><i>It's a word like &quot;postmodernism.&quot;</i> </p>

<p>To me at least, yes. I've said this occasionally in interviews and I get long letters 

back from people saying, You don't understand. Here's what dialecticalism is. </p>

<p><i>And it's incomprehensible again.</i> </p>

<p>Either it's incomprehensible or it's true, but totally obvious. People can be 

tone-deaf, too, they can't hear music. So like maybe I'm tone-deaf about this stuff 

or something. Everything I find in these fields either seems to be interesting but 

pretty obvious, once you see it, maybe you didn't see it, somebody has to point it 

out to you. But once you see it, it's of obvious. Or else the subject is just 

incomprehensible. In other fields it's quite different. If I pick up the latest issue 

of <i>Physics Review</i>, I'm not going to understand one word. But there's two differences. 

First of all, I know perfectly well what I would have to do to get to understand. And 

in some areas, I've even done it, although I'm not particularly good at it. But I can 

do it. The other thing is what you said before: I could ask you to tell me what this 

is about. I can go to some guy in the physics department and say, Tell me, why is 

everybody excited about this stuff? And they can tell it in a way which I can 

understand and adapt it to my level of understanding and also tell me how to go on, 

if I want to. In these other areas, say, dialectical materialism, or postmodern 

literary theory, there's just no way to do either of those two things, which leads me 

to only two conclusions. Either I'm missing a gene, like tone-deafness, which is 

conceivable, or it's a way of disguising maybe interesting ideas in an 

incomprehensible framework for reasons which ultimately turn out to be careerist. I 

don't want to criticize the people for being careerists. It's hard to live in this 

world, and you want to have self-respect. That's understandable and justifiable. And 

it turns out to be true that in most domains if there are hard things to understand, 

they're way beyond us. </p>

<p><i>Another trend in thinking or in how people approach society and try and understand it 

is the approach that's called &quot;conspiracy theory,&quot; which we've both encountered, of 

course. It has gained a great deal of popularity, particularly on the West Coast. I 

wonder not so much in the specific instance of, say, JFK or other conspiracies that 

are discussed, but more broadly in terms of, What's the right way, what's the most 

useful or effective way to try to understand what's going on in society and to 

prepare oneself to interact with it? Is there something about conspiracy theory as 

compared to, what? an approach emphasizing institutions and their implications? 

that's an obstacle, that represents a hindrance on understanding the world to change 

it?</i> </p>

<p>We want to find out the truth about the way things work. There are doubtless cases in 

which people get together, in fact, every example we find of planning decisions is a 

case where people got together and tried to figure something out and used their power 

or the power that they could draw from to try to achieve a result. If you like, 

that's a conspiracy. So with that definition everything that happens is a conspiracy. 

So if the Board of General Motors gets together and decides what kind of Chrysler, 

Ford, something, to produce next year, that's a conspiracy. Every business decision, 

every editorial decision ... </p>

<p><i>Ultimately made by people.</i> </p>

<p>If my department gets together and decides who to appoint next year, okay, it's a 

conspiracy. That's not interesting. Obviously, all decisions involve people. If the 

word conspiracy is to have any sensible meaning, the question becomes whether there 

are groupings well outside the structure of the major institutions that go around 

them, hijack them, undermine them, pursue other courses without an institutional 

base, and so on. </p>

<p><i>So that would be the notion of conspiracy theory. Things happen because these groups 

exist and do them, outside the normal structures of society.</i> </p>

<p>Because these groups or subgroups act outside of the structure of institutional 

power, they are special, and we call them conspiracies. But as I look over history, I 

don't find much of that. There are some cases, like a group of Nazi generals who at 

one point thought of assassinating Hitler. That's a conspiracy. But things like that 

are real blips on the screen, as far as I can see. </p>

<p><i>Supposing there's some number of them, what do you gain from spending a lot of time 

trying to unearth them and uncover them and understand them?</i> </p>

<p>If people want to study the group of generals who decided that it was time to get rid 

of Hitler, that's a fine topic for a monograph, or maybe somebody will write a thesis 

on it. But we're not going to learn anything about the world from it. That will show 

how the people acted in particular circumstances, etc. Fine. </p>

<p><i>You say we're not going to learn anything about the world from it. That's true almost 

by definition. The whole idea is that these people act in a sense outside the normal 

functioning of the world, so studying them teaches us about them, but not about 

typical and recurring patterns in history.</i> </p>

<p>They were acting outside because of unusual circumstances, exactly. And what's more, 

it's only a shade away from the Board of Directors of General Motors sitting down in 

their executive suite and making their regular decisions. It's just a little bit away 

from that because they happened to depart somewhat from the major power structures. 

But we're not learning much about how the world works, in fact, nothing that 

generalizes to the next case. It's going to be historically contingent and specific. 

If you look at modern American history, where these issues have flourished, I think 

such cases are notable by their absence. At least as I read the record, it almost 

never happens. Occasionally you'll find something, like, say, the Reaganites with 

their off-the-shelf subversive and terrorist activities. But that's kind of a fringe 

operation. Probably the reason it got smashed pretty quickly is because the 

institutions are too powerful to tolerate it. Take, say, the CIA, which is considered 

the source of lots of conspiracies. We have a ton of information about them, and as I 

read the information, they're pretty loyal bureaucrats and do what they're told. As 

far as the Pentagon goes, they'll push their interests, and the services will push 

their interests, but in pretty transparent ways. </p>

<p><i>So this is systemic, not conspiratorial. You have two arguments. One is, even if it 

exists, even if there are occasional or even frequent conspiracies, examining them is 

going to teach us about that event. Not much about history or the way things work. 

The next claim is, well, there aren't even that many in the first place.</i> </p>

<p>What they usually are is what you'd find in a big corporation, or in a faculty, or 

any other structure you're in. </p>

<p><i>You think it's generally a normal outgrowth of the operations of an institution.</i> </p>

<p>An institution has a certain structure of power. It has certain resources. It has an 

authority structure. It fits into the general society in certain ways, and if it 

tried to break out of those ways it would be undermined and destroyed. If General 

Motors decided to become a benevolent organization and produce good cars at the 

cheapest rates with the best working conditions, they'd be out of business tomorrow. 

Somebody who isn't doing it would undermine them. There are reasons why institutions 

operate the way they do within a bigger framework. Suppose, say, Clinton, in a dream, 

was really going to behave like the British Labor Party thinks he is, namely the 

revolutionary who is going to bring about a social revolution. In one minute, bond 

prices would start to decline slightly. The interest rate would go up. The economy 

would start to collapse, and that's the end of that program. There are frameworks 

within which things happen. </p>

<p><i>That's because he would be operating as a isolated individual with no power base, 

just because he wants to, perhaps with a few allies, a conspiracy running againts the 

grain, and getting nowhere.</i> </p>

<p>Exactly. And the people who have the power would say, I don't like that, so I'll pull 

my money out of Treasury securities and put it somewhere else. And it goes down and 

you've got a response. In fact, if he doesn't understand it, he could have read a 

front-page article in the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> a couple of weeks ago explaining it in 

simple words, just in case anybody got any ideas. But you don't have to say it. 

Everybody understands it. We have tremendous concentrations of power throughout the 

society in the economy and the political system and the ideological system. They're 

all very interlinked in all kinds of ways, but the degree of power and authority and 

domination is extraordinary. If any renegade group tried to break out of that, they 

would quickly be in trouble and cut off. You can see it happening, right at the top. 

Take, say, Nixon and Watergate. Watergate was just a triviality. In terms of the 

horrifying actions that the government carried out, Watergate isn't even worth 

laughing about. It's a tea party. It's kind of interesting to see what kind of issues 

were raised. </p>

<p><i>A teaparty except for one thing, which is that it was aimed at elites.</i> </p>

<p>It was aimed at elites. He broke out of the normal workings of power. He called 

Thomas Watson of IBM a bad name. He tried to undermine the Democratic Party, which is 

half the business power in the country. Sure, he was called on the carpet and tossed 

out in three seconds. Not because he had violated some moral code. Essentially he was 

not attacked for the atrocities that he carried out. The FBI killed Fred Hampton in 

his administration, a straight Gestapo-style killing. That never came up at 

Watergate. Take the bombing of Cambodia, one of the most dramatic things, this thing 

called the secret bombing of Cambodia, which was &quot;secret&quot; because the press didn't 

talk about what they knew. They killed probably a couple hundred thousand people. 

They devastated a peasant society. It came up, but only in one respect: Did he tell 

Congress about it? In other words, were people with power granted their prerogatives? 

That's the only issue that came up. You can see what happens when somebody even 

marginally breaks out of the system. They're quickly put back in their box, because 

they're servants. Real power lies elsewhere. </p>

<p><i>And even there, it's not individuals. General Motors is an institution and the people 

who run it don't have that much power either.</i> </p>

<p>The head of IBM just got tossed out. Why? They didn't have enough profit last year. 

You either do your job or you're out. Power lies elsewhere. When the American 

corporate system decided the Vietnam War wasn't worth it for them any more, they had 

gotten what they were going to get, they basically told Johnson to go back to Texas. 

He was fired. He was told, You're not going to run. Pull out. Now they have somebody 

else. Within a system that works like this, it would be pretty remarkable if there 

were anything remotely like what the various conspiracy theories conjure up. When you 

look at them, they just collapse, not surprisingly. </p>

<p><i>With perhaps one exception: King's assassination.</i> </p>

<p>It's interesting. That's the one case where we can imagine pretty good reasons why 

somebody would want to kill him. I would not be in the least surprised if there was a 

real conspiracy behind that one, and probably a high-level one. </p>

<p><i>Assuming it was Hoover, then, the mechanism is there, the means are there, everything 

is available. Nobody would be upset in the government.</i> </p>

<p>I don't think there's been a lot of inquiry into that one. If there has I'm not aware 

of it. But that's the one very plausible case. You're absolutely right. In the case 

of the one everybody's excited about, Kennedy, nobody has ever come up with a 

plausible reason. </p>

<p><i>It's an interesting question. Why do you think when you hear these people who believe 

in the efficacy of looking at conspiracy and trying to understand it, the amount of 

energy that goes into the Kennedy case almost can't even be measured, it's off the 

scale, but the amount of energy that goes into the King case is relatively small.</i> </p>

<p>It's a pretty dramatic contrast, because the case of the King one is prima facie very 

plausible. The case of the Kennedy one is prima facie extremely implausible. So it is 

a question that you want to ask. </p>

<p><i>Perhaps if you have a conspiracy approach to things, the more implausible it is, the 

more outside of the normal grain it is, the more of a conspiracy it is, the more 

attractive it is to you. I don't know.</i> </p>

<p>There are things in a way conspiring to make the Kennedy case an attractive topic. 

One is just the glitter of Camelot. The Kennedy administration was in many ways very 

similar to the Reagan administration in power. </p>

<p><i>The glitter of Camelot is specks of blood...</i> </p>

<p>But the point is that the Kennedy administration did one smart thing. They buttered 

up the intellectual class, as compared with the Reaganites, who just treated them 

with contempt. The result was they got a terrific image. They gave an appearance of 

sharing power that was never real to the kind of people who write books and articles 

and make movies and that sort of thing. The result is that Camelot had a beautiful 

image, lovely imagery, and there's been great efforts to maintain that image. Somehow 

they succeeded in getting a lot of people to believe it. You can go down to the 

South, to a poor, rural, black area and you'll find a picture of Kennedy. In fact, 

Kennedy's role in the civil rights movement was not pretty. But somehow the imagery 

succeeded, even if the reality wasn't there. And it's certainly true that a lot of 

things have gone wrong in the last twenty, twenty-five years. Plenty of things have 

gone wrong, for all sorts of totally independent reasons, which one can talk about. 

The civil rights movement made great achievements, but it never lived up to the hopes 

that many people had invested in it. The antiwar movement made achievements, but it 

didn't end war. Real wages have been declining for twenty years. A lot of things have 

been happening that aren't pretty. And it's easy to fall into the belief that we had 

a hero and we had a wonderful country and we had this guy who was going to lead us to 

a better future ... we had the Messiah and <i>they</i> shot him down and ever since then 

everything's been illegitimate. </p>

<P><HR WIDTH=50%>







<p><i>I remember when I was organizing in the sixties and also since, thought it is harder to

elicit when less 

seems to be at stake, I would frequently encounter a view lying behind people's reticence to act

or to 

become part of political movements. The view was basically that human nature is corrupt,

egotistical, 

self-centered, anti-social and that as a result of that, society would always be haves and

have-nots, 

oppressors and oppressed, hierarchical and so on. I'd often find that in organizing you could get 

agreement on the inhumanity of a particular system or the illegality or injustice of, say, the war

or some 

set of policies, more recently, but that people would refrain from becoming active around it

because of a 

sense of hopelessness having to do with this view of human nature. It may have been just an

excuse, and 

it may be just a last line of defense against becoming active, but still, in order to deal with it

you have to 

address the claim. So I'm wondering ...</i> </p>

<p>There is a sense in which the claim is certainly true. There certainly is something ... human

nature, that we 

all have. First of all, it is something we don't know much about. Doubtless there is a rich and

complex human 

nature, and doubtless it's largely genetically determined, like everything else. But we don't know

what it is. 

However, there's enough evidence from history and experience to show that it is certainly at least

consistent 

with everything you mentioned. </p>

<p><i>Since we have had the phenomena, of course they can exist alongside human nature. </i></p>

<p>More than that. We know that human nature, and that includes our nature, yours and mine, can

easily turn 

people into quite efficient torturers and mass murderers and slave drivers and so on. We know

that. You 

don't have to look very far. But what does that mean? Should we therefore not try to stop torture?

If we see 

somebody beating a child to death, should we say, well, you know, that's human nature? Which it

is, in fact, 

an emergence of behavior based on the combination of human nature and certain pressures and 

circumstances. There are certainly conditions under which people will act like that. But to the

extent that the 

statement it true, and there is such an extent, it's just not relevant. Human nature also has the

capacity to lead 

to selflessness and cooperation and sacrifice and support and solidarity and lots of other things,

too. </p>

<p><i>Is there a sense in which one way of being is more consistent with human fulfillment and

development 

and another way of being is somehow contrary to it? Where do values come from?</i> </p>

<p>Where do values come from? That's an interesting question. Any answer that we give is based on

extremely 

little understanding, so nothing one says is very serious. But I don't see how it can fail to be

true, just from 

the conditions of moral judgment it seems to me that it must be true that moral values are

basically rooted in 

our nature. The reason I say that is pretty elementary. Undoubtedly, the way in which we look at

things and 

judge them and assess them and so on has a significant and notable cultural factor. But that

aside, we are 

certainly capable, and everyone does, of making moral judgments and and assessments and

evaluations in 

entirely new situations. We do it all the time. We're constantly coming up with new situations. We

may not 

consciously evaluate them, but we certainly are at least tacitly doing it. It's the basis for our

choice of action. 

So we're constantly making all kinds of judgments, including moral judgments and esthetic

judgments and all 

sorts of others about new things and new situations. Either it's being done just randomly, like

you pull 

something out of a hat, which certainly doesn't seem to be true, either introspectively or by

observation, or 

else we're doing it on the basis of some moral system that we have in our mind somehow which gives 

answers, or at least partial answers, to a whole range of new situations. Nobody knows what that

system is. 

We don't understand it at all. But it seems to be rich and complex enough that it applies to

indefinitely many 

new situations. How did it get there? </p>

<p><i>What characterizes a system like this?</i> </p>

<p>Maybe it's an axiomatic system. I'm sure this is false. You could imagine it's like the axioms

of number 

theory. It's a bunch of principles from which you can deduce consequences, saying this action is

preferable 

to that one. I'm not making that as a serious proposal, but that would be what such a system could

look like. 

Or it could be like language. </p>

<p><i>Could you make a serious proposal?</i> </p>

<p>A serious proposal I suspect is more like what we know about language. A lot is known: that

there are basic 

fundamental principles that are invariant, sort of fixed in our nature. They hold for all

languages. They 

provide the framework for language. They allow a certain limited degree of modification, and that 

modification comes from early experience. When the options of variation are fixed, you have a

whole system 

functioning which allows us to do exactly what you and I are doing, namely to say new things, to

understand 

new things, to interpret new expressions nobody has ever heard. Qualitatively speaking, that's

what the 

system of moral judgment looks like. So it's conceivable that it has a similar kind of basis. But

we have to 

find the answer. You can't just guess. You could say the same about ... </p>

<p><i>It can't be simple. It can't be &quot;Thou shalt not kill,&quot; obviously.</i> </p>

<p>No. Because that's not what we decide. We decide much more complex things. So what are they? We

have 

good reason to believe that they're there because we can in fact make relatively consistent

judgments, 

understood and appreciated by others, sometimes with disagreement, in which case you can have

moral 

discourse. And it's under new conditions and facing new problems, and so on. Unless we're angels,

it got 

into the organism the same way other complex things did, namely, largely by a genetically

determined 

framework which gets marginally modified through the course of probably early experience. That's a

moral 

system. How much variation can there be in such moral systems? Without understanding, we don't

know. 

How much variation can there be in languages? Without understanding we don't know. </p>

<p><i>By variation, you mean from individual to individual?</i> </p>

<p>Or from culture to culture, and so on. We can make a fair guess that it's not much variation.

The reason for 

that is quite elementary. The system appears to be complex and determinate, and there are only two

factors 

that can enter into determining it. One is our fixed internal nature, and the other is experience.

And we know 

that experience is very impoverished. It doesn't give a lot of direction. Suppose somebody asks,

Why do 

children undergo puberty at a certain age? Actually, nobody knows the answer to that, so we're

talking about 

a topic that's unknown. But there are only two factors that can enter into it. One is something in

pre-puberty 

experience that sets you to undergo puberty, some effect of the environment, say, peer pressure,

or somebody 

told you it would be a good idea, or something like that. The other is, you're just designed so

that under 

certain conditions and at a certain level of maturation, hormones, this and that, you undergo

puberty. 

Everybody assumes the second, without knowing anything. If somebody came along and said they think

that 

it's peer pressure that causes puberty because you see other people doing it and you want to be

like them, 

without knowing anything you just laugh. The reason you laugh is very simple. The environment is

not 

specific enough and rich enough to determine this highly specific change that takes place. That

logic holds 

for just about everything in growth and development. That's why people assume without knowledge

that an 

embryo will become a chicken or a human depending on its nature, not depending on the nutrition

that's fed 

in, though its needs the nutrition. The nutrition doesn't have enough information to cause those

highly specific 

changes. And it looks as if things like moral judgment are of that character. </p>

<p><i>As are, you would say, rules of language, perhaps even concepts?</i> </p>

<p>Yeah. For rules of language and for concepts, there's a fair amount of understanding of the

matter, especially 

rules of language. In fact, that's the area of human intelligence where there's most

understanding. But almost 

everything has more or less the same logic. As I said, it's not different from the logic of

embryological 

development. In fact, it's kind of similar to that. I think a reasonable judgment at this point

would be that 

things like moral evaluation are similar. Actually contributing to this is the fact that you can

have moral 

discourse. Take an issue on which people are really split. Take, say, slavery. If you look at the

debate over 

slavery, to a certain extent it wasn't just an intellectual debate, obviously. It was a struggle.

But insofar as it 

was an intellectual debate, and it was, partially, there was a certain shared moral ground to it.

And in fact 

the slave owner's arguments are not so simple to answer. In fact some of them are valid and have a

lot of 

implications, and they were taken seriously by American workers in the late nineteenth century.

</p>

<p><i>You take better care of the slave if you own it than ...</i> </p>

<p>Exactly. You take better care of your car if you own it than if you rent it, so you take better

care of your 

worker if you own it than if you rent it. So slavery is benevolent. And the free market is morally

atrocious. 

Workers who organized into the Knights of Labor and other working-class organizations in the late 

nineteenth century, you look back at the literature and you see a strain running through that

says, look, we 

fought to end slavery, not to impose it. </p>

<p><i>So somehow there are these moral principles or something that you understand that you have

to appeal 

to even if what you're doing is rather venal.</i> </p>

<p>In fact, I think it's extremely rare for even an SS guard or a torturer or whatever to say, I'm

doing this 

because I like to be a son of a bitch. Everybody does bad things in their lives, and if you think

back, it's rare 

that you have said, I'm doing it because I feel like it. </p>

<p><i>You reinterpret the components of it so ...</i> </p>

<p>So it fits the moral values that you share with other people. I don't want to suggest that

moral values are 

uniform; if you look across cultures you do find some differences. But when you look at different

languages 

you also appear to find in fact radical differences. You know they can't be there. Because if the

differences 

were really great, it would have been impossible to acquire any of the languages. So therefore

they've got to 

be superficial, and the scientific question is, prove what must be true by the logic of the

situation. I think the 

same things must be the case for moral judgment, too. Going back to your original point, we can't

reasonably 

doubt that moral values are rooted in our nature, I don't think. </p>

<p><i>But if that's true, I've always had to think about it in such a way that for me the image of

a human being 

is a creature with certain kinds of needs and desires and potentials and capabilities and that the 

fulfillment of those is social, that the fulfillment of those doesn't entail that one crush

another, that one 

be on top of another, that one gain at another's loss and so on. If that's true, and if people

have this 

shared set of values, then you have to explain why everything is as corrupt and hierarchical and 

war-laden as it is.</i> </p>

<p>First of all, why not ask another question: how come there is so much sympathy and care and

love and 

solidarity? That's also true. </p>

<p><i>That's the reverse. That's the way I answer it all the time.</i> </p>

<p>There's no such thing as, Why is there so much of this and so much of that? There is what there

is. What there 

is is doubtless conditioned by the opportunities and choices that are imposed and available in a

particular 

social, cultural, and even physical setting. </p>

<p><i>Someone might say, just to clarify what all this means, to truck and barter is human.</i>

</p>

<p>Someone can say it, but there's no reason to believe it. </p>

<p><i>Why isn't there any reason to believe it? The person's argument is, Look around. Trucking

and bartering 

everywhere.</i> </p>

<p>And you look at peasant societies and they lived for thousands of years without it. Take a look

inside a 

family. Do people truck and barter over how much they're going to eat for dinner? Certainly a

family is a 

normal social structure. You can't exist without it. And you don't have trucking and bartering in

it. If you look 

back at the history of trucking and bartering, say, look at the history of modern capitalism, here

we know a 

lot about it. First of all, peasants had to be driven by force and violence into a labor system.

They didn't 

want it. Then there were major conscious efforts made to create wants. There's a whole interesting

literature 

about want creation. It happened over a long stretch in the evolution of capitalism, but you see

it 

encapsulated briefly when slavery was terminated. It's dramatic to look at those cases. </p>

<p><i>You see it all the time on TV.</i> </p>

<p>Creating wants, yes. But I'm talking about conscious discussion of the need to do it. In the

early 1830s there 

was a big slave revolt in Jamaica, which was one of the things that led the British to decide to

give up 

slavery, that is, it was not paying any more. Within a couple of years they had to go from a slave

economy to 

a so-called &quot;free&quot; economy. But they wanted it to remain exactly the same. They

understood this. You take a 

look at the parliamentary debates. They're very conscious that they've got to keep it the way it

is. The 

masters become the owners. The slaves become the happy workers. We've got to somehow work it out.

</p>

<p><i>Distribution of wealth and power, keep it. Slave relation, dump it.</i> </p>

<p>Yes, they wanted everything to remain the same except not formal slavery, and the problem is,

how do you 

do it? There's a lot of open land in Jamaica. If you let the slaves go free, they're just going to

go out on the 

land and settle and be perfectly happy and they're not going to work for the sugar plantations.

How are we 

going to force them to work on the plantation? Two things were decided. This was the period when 

everybody was talking about how marvelous free trade is, the government's not allowed to intervene

and you 

can't help people in the Irish famine a decade away and that sort of thing. But in Jamaica it was

a little 

different. There they said, we'll use government state force to close off the lands so people

can't go to the 

land. And since all these workers don't really want a lot of things, they're just going to satisfy

their needs, 

which they can easily do in this tropical climate, we have to create wants. We have to create a

set of wants 

so that they desire things which they now don't desire. And the only way they'll be able to

achieve those 

desires is by working as wage labor in order to get them. There was conscious discussion and in

fact 

extensive efforts made to do exactly what you see on TV: create wants so that people would be

driven into a 

wage labor society which they don't want themselves. That pattern is done over and over again

through the 

history of capitalism. In fact, what the history of capitalism shows is that throughout people had

to be driven 

into situations which are now claimed to be their nature. If the history shows anything, it's that

that's not their 

nature. </p>

<p><i>But of course if you erase the history, erase the evidence, and look only at a snapshot of

the present, it's 

a consistent hypothesis that maybe it is natural. It becomes a compelling legitimation.</i> </p>

<p>Sure. But again, by that argument, you could justify slavery. Take a snapshot of a slave

society, and probably 

under most circumstances most of the slaves not only accept it but want it to stay that way.

That's the only 

way they can survive. They look to the master to protect them. They don't want to give that up.

Same about 

feudal societies. Same about absolutism. Probably the same about prisons, if you bother to look.

</p>

<p><i>So what is it about the society we live under that is at the core of what's wrong? What's

got to go?</i> </p>

<p>In my opinion, <i>every</i> form of authority and domination and hierarchy, every authoritarian

structure has to 

justify itself. It has no prior justification. It has to prove that it's justified. </p>

<p><i>What kind of authoritarian structure?</i> </p>

<p>Anything. </p>

<p><i>Something where one person has more power than another.</i> </p>

<p>Yeah. Like you stop your three-year-old kid when he's trying to cross the street. That's an

authoritarian 

situation. It's got to be justified. Okay, I think in that case you can give a justification for

it. The burden of 

proof is on the person exercising the authority, invariably. Most of the time, when you look,

these structures 

have no justification. They have no moral justification. They have no justification in the

interests of the 

person lower in the hierarchy, or other people, or the environment, or the future, or the society,

or anything 

else. They're there in order to preserve certain structures of power and domination that benefit

those at the 

top. And every time you find that, it's illegitimate and it should change. And we find it

everywhere. We find 

it in all kinds of human relations, crucially in economic relations, which are at the core of how

any society 

functions. What's produced, what's consumed, what's distributed, what decision was made. These

things help 

set a framework within which everything else happens. And they're completely hierarchic and

authoritarian. </p>

<p><i>It's also true that how people live their lives in their homes, how people regard one

another, sets a 

framework in which even work is affected. All these things mutually interact with each other and

affect 

one another.</i> </p>

<p>And in every one of them that you look at, there are questions about authority and domination

that ought to be 

raised constantly, and that very rarely have satisfactory answers. Sometimes they do, I think, but

it has to be 

shown. As a matter of fact, you can even ask the same about your relation to animals. The

questions can be 

asked there, too, in fact are being asked. </p>

<p><i>You're an animal rights activist?</i> </p>

<p>I think it's a serious question. To what extent do we have a right to torture animals? I think

it's a very good 

thing that that question ... </p>

<p><i>Torture?</i> </p>

<p>Experiments are torturing animals, let's say. That's what they are. So to what extent do we

have a right to 

torture animals for our own good? I think that's not a trivial question. </p>

<p><i>What about eating?</i> </p>

<p>Same question. </p>

<p><i>Are you a vegetarian?</i> </p>

<p>I'm not, but I think it's a serious question. If you want my guess, my guess would be that ...

</p>

<p><i>A hundred years from now everyone will be.</i> </p>

<p>I don't know if it's a hundred years, but it seems to me if history continues--that's not at

all obvious, that it 

will--but if society continues to develop without catastrophe on something like the course that

you can sort of 

see over time, I wouldn't be in the least surprised if it moves toward vegetarianism and

protection of animal 

rights. In fact, what we've seen over the years--and it's hard to be optimistic in the twentieth

century, which 

is one of the worst centuries in human history in terms of atrocities and terror and so on--but

still, over the 

years, including the twentieth century, there is a widening of the moral realm, bringing in

broader and 

broader domains of individuals who are regarded as moral agents. </p>

<p><i>Nothing could be happening to that underlying, wired-in, inate, intrinsic character... That

can't be 

changing.</i> </p>

<p>No, but it can get more and more realized. You can get a better and better understanding of it.

We're 

self-conscious beings. We're not rocks. And we can get more and more understanding of our own

nature, not 

because we read a book about it. The book doesn't have anything to tell you, because nobody knows 

anything. But just through experience, including historical experience, which is part of our own

personal 

experience because it's embedded in our culture, which we enter into. </p>

<p><i>So then it's plausible that vegetarians, animal rights advocates and the like are just a

couple of steps 

ahead in discerning something about ...</i> </p>

<p>It's possible. I think I'd certainly keep an open mind on that. You can understand how it could

be true. It's 

certainly a pretty intelligible idea to us. I think one can see the moral force to it. You don't

have to go back 

very far to find gratuitous torture of animals. In Cartesian philosophy, for example, where it was

assumed ... 

the Cartesians thought they had proven that humans had minds and everything else in the world was

a 

machine. So there's no difference between a cat and a watch, let's say. It's just the cat's a

little more 

complicated. You go back to the court in the seventeenth century, and big smart guys who studied

all that 

stuff and thought they understood it would as a sport take Lady So-and-So's favorite dog and kick

it and beat 

it to death and so on and laugh, saying, this silly lady doesn't understand the latest philosophy,

which was 

that it was just like dropping a rock on the floor. That's gratuitous torture of animals. It was

regarded as if 

we would ask a question about the torturing of a rock. You can't do it. There's no way to torture

a rock. The 

moral sphere has certainly changed in that respect. Gratuitous torture of animals is no longer

considered 

quite legitimate. </p>

<p><i>Maybe what's changing is the understanding of what an animal is, rather than some of the

underlying 

moral values.</i> </p>

<p>In that case it probably was, because in fact the Cartesian view was a departure from the

traditional view, in 

which you didn't torture animals gratuitously. On the other hand, there are cultures like, say,

fox hunting, 

aristocratic cultures that have fox hunting as a sport, or say, bear baiting, or things like that,

in which there 

actually was gratuitous torture of animals. In fact, it's kind of intriguing to see how we regard

this. Take cock 

fighting, in which cocks are trained to tear each other to shreds. Our culture happens to regard

that as 

barbaric. On the other hand, we train humans to tear each other to shreds. It's called boxing

matches. And 

that's not regarded as barbaric. So there are things we don't permit of cocks that we permit of

poor people. 

There are some funny values at work there. </p>

<p><i>It's peculiar. But of course we don't pay the birds, whereas we pay the boxers handsomely.

We assume 

that they suffer.</i> </p>

<p>But everybody knows that you don't find people going into professional boxing from wealthy

families. That 

tells you something right away. </p>

<p><i>So if authority relations are the things that are suspect, the things that have to be

undone, what are the 

institutions that basically embody that? Presumably private ownership.</i> </p>

<p>Private ownership's an obvious one. Patriarchic relations are another. Relations of race

discrimination and 

oppression are others. </p>

<p><i>How about the market?</i> </p>

<p>The market itself, just by its very logic, induces oppressive relations very quickly, simply

because of the 

inequities it produces. </p>

<p><i>That's where the justice or equity in some sense is the thing that's abrogated by authority,

the thing that 

you want to justify.</i> </p>

<p>I think authority and justice are incompatible, except in very rare instances, namely, if the

authority can be 

justified. And maybe sometimes it can. Like the case of caring for children. I think there it can

be justified. 

Or suppose we had a catastrophe, let's say. Suppose a hurricane swept over this place and a couple

of 

people who for some reason happened to have their heads screwed on sort of took control and told

us, do 

this, do that, do the other thing. I'd follow them. I wouldn't know what to do. If they seemed to

understand 

what has to be done, had presence of mind, some understanding of the situation, I think I would

willingly 

grant them the authority to make decisions that I don't feel competent to make, and I'd rather

have them make 

them. So I grant them the authority to do it. That's a situation of authority. But we agree to it.

</p>

<p><i>Suppose somebody comes along and says that most working people in fact are granting the

authority of 

their employers and bosses on the grounds that they don't have the expertise, the knowledge, the

skills, 

etc., and they also don't want the burden and the responsibility?</i> </p>

<p>I would ask the same question that we would ask of prisoners. Suppose somebody said the

prisoners are 

voluntarily granting the authority to the guards. I'd believe that when it's proven. The burden of

proof, again, 

is always on the person who claims that the authority is justified. I think that's a fundamental

moral principle. </p>

<p><i>Sure, but if you want to make a counterargument...</i> </p>

<p>It may not be that simple. In fact, it's not that simple. Let's make it realistic. The way

things are now, and this 

has been true throughout modern history, people have chosen to go to jail because they can

survive. If you're 

starving to death on the outside, freezing to death, there are many cases, and there are cases

right now where 

they go out and break a window and say, hey, put me in jail. It looks like he's choosing to be

kicked around 

by the warden. </p>

<p><i>Because it's better than another horrible situation.</i> </p>

<p>It's true in a sense. </p>

<p><i>It's also true that people choose to work for employers who will exploit them because

there's no other 

option.</i> </p>

<p>You have to look at the range of options that are not only objectively available to them, but

that are 

subjectively available. How are they allowed to think? How are they able to think? There are all

kinds of 

ways of thinking that are kind of cut off from us, not because we're incapable of them, but there

are various 

blockages that have been developed and imposed that keep us from thinking about them. Actually,

that's what 

indoctrination is about. And I don't mean somebody giving you lectures. Sitcoms on television,

sports that 

you watch. Every aspect of the culture involves some form of expression of what a proper life or a

proper 

set of values are, implicitly. That's all indoctrination, and that cuts off opportunities. And

often just straight 

violence. If people cannot find what their own values are except through interaction, what's

called political 

theory, there's not much theory to it, it's truisms, but one of the traditional ideas of political

theory for 

hundreds of years has been that in order to maintain absolute control--what we nowadays call

totalitarian 

societies--what you have to do is isolate people. People have to be isolated in order to be

controlled. And 

once they're isolated they're easily controlled because they don't even know what they think.

You're sitting 

alone in a room and you don't even know what you think. Again, in science, it's a commonplace. You

work 

together. There's no other way to work. In order to have ideas or understanding, you have to sort

of bounce 

them off other people and see what their reactions are and learn from them. That's the way you

even find out 

what your values are, or your interests, or anything else. Keep people isolated and they don't

have subjective 

options, even if they have objective ones. And unless those options are opened up, both

subjectively and in 

fact concretely, namely you can do something about it without suicide or suffering, then to claim

that people 

choose their oppression is completely meaningless. They choose it under conditions where there

isn't a 

choice. </p>

<p><i>Suppose somebody said that that kind of observation is taken from on high. Who are you to

decide that 

what somebody else is choosing has been constrained? Who are you decide? Once you start doing that

...</i> </p>

<p>It's for them to decide. I agree. I think it's for the people to decide. But the point is the

people should be 

given every opportunity to make a considered choice, meaning an opportunity to think through the

options 

and so on. For example, I've just been reading a novel by an Egyptian novelist who won the Nobel

Prize a 

couple of years ago about life in Cairo, I think it was in the 1920s. The central story is a woman

who lives 

under the iron rule of her husband. She's a total slave. In a big tragedy, she gets kicked out for

this or that 

infringement. Her life is destroyed because she loved being a slave. She was able to take care of

the house, 

and she had her domain in which she was not out of the house, but that's ok, because the husband

is the god, 

that sort of thing. You can imagine the rest. Did she choose that? I don't know if it's an

accurate depiction of 

some society. But it could be. In fact, I'm sure it is of some societies. Did she choose it? In a

sense, yes. Is it 

therefore her nature? In order to know the answer to that question, you have to put that same

person in other 

circumstances. </p>

<p><i>People have a remarkable talent for making the best of whatever situation they're in, and

that's obviously 

a tremendously advantageous quality. But it's also a quality that leaves you trapped in

circumstances 

that are far less desirable than you might otherwise attain.</i> </p>

<p>That's the point of isolation--cut people off from thinking through and perceiving the

opportunities that are 

available to them. Leave them only making do with things as they are. </p>

<p><i>So suppose we eliminate these obstacles to human beings being free and liberated and

fulfilling 

themselves. What does that mean? What kind of a society is that? Clearly, there's been one label

given to 

this--socialism--over the years.But nowadays people claim this failed, that something went

wrong.</i> </p>

<p>First of all, I don't know that anything went wrong. We may not be ready for it. But there was

a period in 

history when we weren't ready for ending slavery, either. There was a period in human history when 

conditions, including subjective conditions, were such that ending slavery wasn't in the cards.

You could 

argue--I don't agree with it--one could argue that conditions are such that we need the degree of

hierarchy 

and domination that exists in totalitarian institutions like capitalist enterprises in order to

satisfy our needs, 

at least so far in history. </p>

<p><i>With central planning or dictatorship ...</i> </p>

<p>It could be argued. I don't believe a word of it. But the point is somebody would have to argue

it. If you look 

at what actually happened, the concentration of force and violence was such as to guarantee

certain 

outcomes. Those outcomes destroyed incipient efforts at cooperative worker control, say. There

have been 

efforts in that direction for hundreds of years. They regularly get crushed. And they get crushed

by force. The 

Bolsheviks are a perfectly good example. In the stages leading up to the Bolshevik revolution, up

to October 

1917, there were incipient socialist institutions being developed--workers' councils, things like

that. They 

survived to an extent, but not very long. They were pretty much eliminated. You can argue about

the 

justification, but the fact is that they were pretty quickly eliminated. Some people want to

justify it. The 

standard justification is, Lenin and Trotsky had to do it because of the contingencies of the

civil war and 

survival and this and that. </p>

<p><i>There wouldn't have been food otherwise, says the apologis.</i> </p>

<p>Right. That's the only kind of justification that immoral acts can possibly get. That's the

only kind of 

justification that authority can ever get. Look, we needed it. It's like my hurricane example.

Under dire 

conditions you accept authority. </p>

<p><i>Actually, it's exactly analogous to the hurricane example.</i> </p>

<p>Exactly analogous. The question is, Is it true? There you've got to look at the historical

facts. I don't think it's 

true. In fact, I think these structures were dismantled before the ... </p>

<p><i>Yes, they were. But does a Lenin or a Trotsky sincerely feel that they're like the couple of

people who are 

running through the streets helping in the hurricane, or are they just aggrandizing their own

wealth and 

power and status? Or it is the same thing?</i> </p>

<p>I think it's the same thing. We don't want to be cavalier about it. It's a question of

historical fact and what the 

people really were like and what they were thinking, and you've got to find out what the answer

is. But my 

feeling is, reading their own writings, that they knew what they were doing and it was

understandable and 

they even had a theory behind it. It was both a moral theory and a socio-economic theory. First of

all, as 

good orthodox Marxists, they didn't really believe that a socialist revolution was possible in

Russia, which 

was just a peasant backwater. So they were carrying out a kind of holding action, waiting for the

iron laws 

of history to grind out the revolution in Germany, where it's supposed to come. You know the story

better 

than I do. That's what's supposed to happen by historical necessity, so they're going to hold on

until it 

happens, and then Russia will be backwarder than it ought to be. Well, it didn't happen in

Germany. They 

also thought that in this pre-capitalist society, Russia being a deeply impoverished Third World

society, 

basically pre-capitalist, except for little pockets here and there, it was just necessary to beat

the people into 

development. They had to be turned into what Trotsky called the &quot;labor army&quot; in order to

carry out forced 

development, which would somehow carry them over the early stages of capitalism and

industrialization to 

the point where then the iron laws of history would start to work because the master said they

were going to. 

So there was a theory behind it, and a moral principle. It's going to be better for them in a

while. </p>

<p><i>So these could be understandable and even honest mistakes, or they could be natural

outgrowths of a 

worldview which says there are relatively few people who are exceptionally smart and should run

the 

show.</i> </p>

<p>That was Bakunin's prediction, about half a century before, that this was exactly what was

going to happen. 

He was talking about the Marxists at that time. That was before Lenin was born. His prediction

was, the 

nature of the intelligentsia as a formation in modern industrial society is that they can become

managers. 

They're not going to become managers because they own capital. They're not going to become

managers 

because they've got a lot of guns. They're going to become managers because they can control and

organize 

and direct what's called knowledge and so on. </p>

<p><i>Information and skills and access to decision-making.</i> </p>

<p>And he says they're going to become a Red bureaucracy, because that's in their interests. He

didn't say that's 

the nature of people. I don't know how much he thought it through. But reading back, we shouldn't

say they 

are going to do it because that's the nature of people. It's that the ones who don't do it will be

cast by the 

wayside. The ones who do do it will make out. The ones who are worthless and brutal and harsh

enough to 

do it, they're the ones who are going to survive in this kind of system. The ones who try to

associate 

themselves with popular organizations and to help the people themselves become organized and to

serve the 

people and that kind of thing are just not going to survive in these situations of power. </p>

<p><i>Supposing you have a relative advantage on information and knowledge. How do you explain

that to 

yourself? It's not too dissimilar from having a great amount of wealth, material wealth. You

either have 

that material wealth or knowledge by virtue of somehow being better or by virtue of somehow

unjustly 

having more than you deserve. It's a lot easier to assume that it's because you're better.</i>

</p>

<p>Why is it &quot;better&quot;? </p>

<p><i>You're in the lead.</i> </p>

<p>But all kinds of people are better at all kinds of things. There are things that I think I'm

better at than the guy 

across the street. There are things that the guy across the street's better at than I am. Who's

better? </p>

<p><i>You have a healthy view of the situation. There's an unhealthy view of the situation which

says, The 

reason why I have three cars and a huge house, etc., is because I am a different kind of human

being. I 

am superior. It's like racism, except it doesn't have skin color as its ...</i> </p>

<p>Everyone has some particular distribution of traits. You're better at some things and worse at

others. This 

guy is a good violinist. This guy can't hear straight. This guy can fix mechanical things and

understand them. 

The other one can't. If it wasn't true, I'd want to commit suicide. Living in a society of clones

would be 

worse than death. If everybody was alike it's not like living at all. You should enjoy and

appreciate the 

variety. The fact that other people can do things that I can't do is a source of appreciation. I

don't feel bad if I 

can't play the violin like somebody else. If I can't solve physics problems like somebody else,

fine. It makes 

me happy. You do what you do. Getting back to your point, the particular distribution of traits

that I have, 

partly just by nature, partly by the advantages that I've had through life, which were plenty, in

the case of the 

guy with three cars, there's a particular collection of traits plus luck. And the traits might be

viciousness, 

aggressiveness, willingness to undercut others, and so on, whatever that collection of traits is,

they're the 

ones that are valued and supported in particular social arrangements. So the Mafia don has traits

which are 

rewarded under particular social situations. Hitler had traits which were rewarded under those

social 

situations. That part's true, in that sense. It doesn't mean that they're better. It means that

they're better adapted 

to getting ahead under particular conditions. </p>

<p><i>The person in that position can have your understanding of the situation or can have an

understanding of 

the situation that it's just basically theft or can understand the situation as a proper reward

for 

somebody who is a superior being.</i> </p>

<p>Usually people will pick the last one. </p>

<p><i>Right. That's my point. But once you pick the last one, if you're Lenin or Trotsky or

whoever, then the 

understanding of society that you come up with tends to reflect that. So you come up with yourself

as a 

central actor, even a savior. You think there's a hurricane coming and I have to save everybody

from it, 

when in fact there is no hurricane coming, or, in any event, the only solution is for people to be

saving 

themselves, not having their means to do so taken away by you. There was the possibility of real 

democracy and real participation instead. But you see a hurricane because the role of savior is

the one 

you want to fill.</i> </p>

<p>And that's where I come back to what I said before. The burden of proof is always on the person

who claims 

the right of authority. So if you see a hurricane coming, prove it. If you can convince me that

there's a 

hurricane coming, and that you're the person who ought to direct people, okay, maybe so. But

you've got to 

prove it. I don't have to disprove it. I don't have to disprove anything. I can just say, You

haven't proven it. 

Period. And then I win. </p>

<p><i>And beating you over the head till you agree or holding all the cards and allowing no one to

play unless 

they agree, is of course not proving it, it is coercing it...</i> </p>

<p>Yes, and so that's the sense in which the burden of proof is on those who claim the legitimacy

of authority. 

And that's true whether it's a factory, a family or any other social arrangement. I think that

that burden can 

very rarely be met. It seems to me that part of real education, if we ever allowed such a thing,

would be to 

make sure people understand very early on that that's where the burden of proof is. I think you

don't have to 

try to teach it to people, however. I think they know it. You have to keep it from being driven

out of their 

heads. And it is driven out of their heads. It's driven out of their heads very early on just by

the structure of 

the educational system. </p>

<p>Kids who are too independent quickly get into trouble and are kept in line. Again, we don't

want to be glib 

about it. Again, the burden of proof is always on whoever it is that claims that the child has to

be controlled. 

Maybe the child is being independent and should be encouraged. It's just personal experience. As a

kid I 

happened to be lucky enough to be until I was about twelve in an experimental school run on

Deweyite lines 

by Temple University which happened to be a very free and open and independent place where they 

encouraged independence and creativity and so on. It was very constructive. It was a shock to me

when I got 

into City Academic High School for upward-striving kids who were going to go off to big colleges

and 

discovered what authority really is like in educational structures. I never had that before. And

it certainly 

requires justification, and I doubt that justification can be given in a great many cases. A lot

of even the 

stupidity of education has a social function, namely, preventing independence. You're given some

stupid 

assignment in eighth grade, and you'd better obey. </p>

<p><i>I've noticed that the public school system teaches not just obedience but also endurance of

boredom, the 

ability to sit and watch the clock and not run out of the room, which of course is exactly the

skill that one 

has to have to work in a capitalist firm.</i> </p>

<p>Punctuality. My oldest friend, who happened to emigrate from Eastern Europe when he was fifteen

or so, 

once told me that he went to a school in New York for bright kids. One of the things that struck

him right off 

in comparison with his earlier education was that if you got a C on an exam, nobody paid any

attention. But 

if you came two minutes late, you had to go to the principal's office--meaning you're being

trained for 

docility, obedience, punctuality for an assembly line job. </p>

<p><i>I remember even at MIT I was always astounded by the extent to which the education was

faculty coming 

in and writing textbooks on the wall and never once talking about the creative aspect of what they

do, or 

never literally doing it with you, but rather just reproducing stuff that you could go off and

read in any 

event.</i> </p>

<p>It surprises me when you say that. </p>

<p><i>As a undergraduate.</i> </p>

<p>In graduate school it's just not like that at all. In fact, graduate school is kind of like an

apprenticeship. 

You're working together. </p>

<p><i>Clearly that's the mode of education that makes some sense. The words are horrible:

&quot;master&quot; and 

&quot;apprentice,&quot; but the reality is interesting...</i> </p>

<p>It's because you're learning a craft. Apprenticeship doesn't mean necessarily following orders.

You can 

contribute and have your own ideas and learn at the same time. Doing science properly just isn't

something 

you can teach. No one knows how to teach it. You just kind of get the idea somehow. It's like

learning how to 

ride a bike or build a table. The way you get the idea is by working with people who somehow got

the idea. 

You get something from them, and in science certainly you contribute to them. Everybody knows in

the 

sciences that an awful lot of good ideas are coming from young people. That's just standard. </p>

<p><i>All your ideas come from students.</i> </p>

<p>It's just not even a question. You just take it for granted. </p>

<p><i>So you get the ideas from the students. Supposing we had a society with no authority,

where's the drive? 

Where's the momentum? Where's the pressure to advance and grow? These are questions this

discussion 

probably raises for some people.</i> </p>

<p>First of all, the &quot;pressure to advance,&quot; you have to ask exactly what that means. If

you mean the pressure to 

produce more, who wants it? Is that necessarily the right thing to do? That's not obvious. In many

areas it's 

probably the wrong thing to do. </p>

<p><i>Therefore the criticism that having this degree of freedom will remove that type of pressure

isn't 

criticism at all. It's a compliment.</i> </p>

<p>Let's go back to the period when people had to be driven. It's still today. People have to be

driven to have 

certain wants. Why? Why not leave them alone so they can just be happy and do other things? The

only drive 

there is, ought to be internal. Take a look at kids. They're creative. They explore. They want to

find out 

everything, try out new things. Why does a kid walk? </p>

<p><i>They have plenty of energy, curiosity, desire, but they don't want to work themselves to

death.</i> </p>

<p>Why does a kid walk? Say you've got a kid who's a year old. He's crawling fine. He can get

anywhere across 

the room he likes really fast, so fast his parents run after him to keep him from knocking

everything down. 

All of a sudden he gets up and starts walking. He's terrible at walking. He walks one step and

falls on his 

face. If he wants to really get somewhere he's going to crawl. So why does the kid start walking?

To do new 

things. That's the way we're built. We're built to want to do new things, even if they're not

efficient, even if 

they're harmful, even if you get hurt. I don't think that ever stops. You want to explore. You

want to press 

your capacities to the limits. You want to appreciate what you can do. The joy of creation is

something very 

few people have circumstances to experience much. Artists have it. Craftspeople have it.

Scientists have it. 

Most people don't have the opportunity often, in our society. But if you've been lucky enough to

have that 

opportunity, you know it's quite an experience. It doesn't have to be discovering Einstein's

theory of 

relativity. </p>

<p><i>Your way of expressing it is so different from ... I remember--we won't use names--a

physicist at MIT who 

gave a big talk and described the pleasure and the joy of creativity and wished that so many

people, 99% 

of the population, who don't have the capacity to experience that and to enjoy that, could have

that 

capacity. But since they don't I'll at least try to convey to them the pleasure that I get out of

having a new 

idea.</i> </p>

<p>I think that the physicist didn't want to think. Whoever it was knows perfectly well that

anyone can have that 

pleasure and that whoever it was had that pleasure many times in his life just by seeing what

other people 

have done. </p>

<p><i>You can also have it at many different levels of ...</i> </p>

<p>When you read a proof and finally figure out what it's about, it's exciting. </p>

<p><i>And it could be Pythagorean's theorem ... tenth grade as well as quantum mechanics, or

whatever ...</i> </p>

<p>That's exciting. My God, I never understood that before! That's creativity, even if somebody

proved it 2,000 

years ago. Every physicist has gone through that plenty of times. You keep being struck by the

marvels of 

what you're discovering, and you're discovering it, even though somebody else did it already. And

if you can 

add little bits to that here and there, that's exciting. I don't have any reason to believe what

that physicist said 

... And I think the same is true of a person who builds a boat. I don't see what's fundamentally

any different. </p>

<p><i>It doesn't seem to be any different at all as far as creativity and pleasure of

accomplishment, etc., unless 

of course an onus is put on it.</i> </p>

<p>I wish I could do that. I can't. I can't imagine doing it. </p>

<p><i>But there's one sense in which it's different. That is there's a social difference between

those kinds of acts 

that can accrue power and the kinds that won't. The skills of building a boat are different than

the skills 

of, say, conducting a meeting. Or for that matter being compelling verbally is very different

than, say, 

running quickly, at least in most societies.</i> </p>

<p>But the skills to which rewards and power accrue are violence ... </p>

<p><i>I don't mean necessarily in a bad society, I mean even in a good society. In a good society

the person who 

can make an argument and express herself well is going to be more influential if that isn't

equalized 

somehow. It's relatively equalized. The person who runs fast but has no verbal abilities

whatsoever, 

how's the person ...?</i> </p>

<p>I don't think it's true. I've been in situations, and I'm sure you have, when I knew I was

presenting the right 

argument, but I couldn't convince anybody. Because they decided to do something else. It happens

all the 

time. It happens in personal life, in family arguments, social situations, and so on. Unless the

person 

who--maybe some Martian watching this can say, Jones won the argument. But unless Jones has the

power to 

implement it, it doesn't make any difference. </p>

<p><i>If you're working with a group or you're in some kind of organization or whatever, a

business, whatever 

it might happen to be, and suppose there is a degree of equity and fairness, at least formal, with

regard 

to decision-making, and you all sit around and make decisions, and one or two people have

knowledge of 

how the whole operation works and have at their fingertips a whole lot of information and facts

about 

what's going on and also are very verbal, and some of the other people have productive skills and 

various other skills that are associated with the business, but don't have that information at

their 

disposal, there isn't any doubt in my mind who's going to win nine times out of ten.</i> </p>

<p>Win what? </p>

<p><i>Policy decisions.</i> </p>

<p>The policy decisions. And who will win the decisions about how it's actually implemented? The

people 

with the productive skills. </p>

<p><i>No. Not necessarily at all.</i> </p>

<p>Why not? They're the ones who are going to do it. In a society with equity. We were assuming a

society with 

equity. Nobody has any power. They just have different capacities. </p>

<p><i>One person, one vote.</i> </p>

<p>All right, the person who makes the more convincing argument, assuming rationality, should

convince the 

others. But then the person who implements the decisions will do it his or her way. </p>

<p><i>Clearly the situation will be much better if everybody comes to a decision with a degree of

confidence 

and skills and so on that's commensurate to participating.</i> </p>

<p>That's what it means by being convinced. If you are convinced that this is the right thing to

do, it doesn't make 

any difference whether somebody else had the idea or you had the idea. You're equally convinced.

If you're 

not convinced, something went wrong. Then it was a situation of power and not a matter of greater

capacity 

to work things out. </p>

<p><i>Take a Yugoslav firm in the market system. The workers appoint a manager. The manager makes

a whole 

array of decisions that are the same as a manager would make in the Ford Motor Company. The

workers 

in fact agree that the manager's decisions make sense and should be implemented. They can't make

the 

decisions themselves, necessarily, because they don't have access to the facts. Still the

situation is pretty 

disgusting.</i> </p>

<p>There's a situation where there's a difference of power, and the power translates into access

to ... </p>

<p><i>What if the formal power rests with the workers?</i> </p>

<p>There's already a presupposition: the manager had more information and the manager got that

because the 

manager had more power. Otherwise the manager wouldn't have had more information. </p>

<p><i>The manager's job is to oversee all this information and put the stuff together.</i> </p>

<p>But if you divide jobs up that way you're imposing relations of power. </p>

<p><i>Exactly. That's what I'm getting at.</i> </p>

<p>But if we extract the power from the situation it won't be true. If everyone has the same

access to 

information, it still may turn out that the guy who happens to be the manager comes up with the

best idea and 

everybody says, Yeah, that's the best idea. Okay, fine. That's not a problem. We know that it's

not going to 

happen consistently. There's one area of human life that I know of which kind of approximates an

equitable 

situation. It isn't really equitable, but it approximates one. That's a scientific laboratory, a

scientific 

enterprise, where you have a senior professor who won a Nobel Prize and you have an undergraduate 

assistant, a lab technician and so on. If it's really working well, there's a lot of cooperation.

And you see it. It 

is not the case that the person with the more publications comes up with all the answers, by no

means. If 

they're really working together and trying to achieve something ... </p>

<p><i>Then it's a collective, or something. If you don't have structurally imposed differences in

decision making 

power or in access to information needed for developing agendas and positions, fine.</i> </p>

<p>It may be that the guy with the Nobel Prize will often come up with a good idea. Maybe not. In

fact, in these 

situations it typically isn't the case. It's often the graduate student. </p>

<p><i>After they've got a Nobel Prize they're already too old.</i> </p>

<p>Probably. Or they're too stuck in their ways. But the senior professor often has a contribution

to make that's 

unique: experience, remembering something that somebody did four years ago that nobody else ever

heard 

of. There are all kinds of ways in which people contribute to collective decisions. I don't see

any reason to 

believe that, say, a decision in a factory is so infinitely more complex than working on an

advanced 

scientific problem that you can expect one person to always have the right ideas. That's not going

to happen. 

If it happens, it's because of power differences. </p>

<p><i>An imbalance</i> in access to decision making or information or skills critical to it...

</p>

<p>And then we're back to where we were: eliminate the power differences, or strive to eliminate

them. </p>

<p><i>Let me switch gears a minute. Back to the question of animal rights, the broadening

understanding of 

human values and all that. How do you react to the debate around abortion?</i> </p>

<p>I think it's a hard one. I don't think the answers are simple. It's a case where there really

are conflicting 

values. Most human situations, the kinds of things we're in all the time, it's very rare that

there's a clear and 

simple answer. Sometimes the answers are very murky because we have different values and they just 

conflict. At least our understanding of our own moral values is not like an axiomatic system,

where there's an 

answer and not some other answer. There are what appear to be conflicting values which give

different 

answers. Maybe because we don't understand them well enough, or maybe they really are in conflict.

In this 

case they're straight conflicts. From one point of view, a child up to a point is an organ of the

mother's body. 

The mother ought to have the decision what to do. And that's true. From another point of view, the

organism 

is a potential human being, and it has rights. And those two things are in conflict. One biologist

I know once 

pointed out that you could say the same thing about women washing their hands. If a woman washes

her 

hands, lots of cells flake off, and in principle those cells have the genetic instructions for a

human being. You 

can imagine a future technology which would take one of them and create a human being from it. He

was 

making it as a reductio ad absurdum argument, but because there's an element of truth to it, an

element so tiny 

that it makes it a reductio ad absurdum argument, but it's not like saying something about

astrology. What he's 

saying is true. </p>

<p><i>There's a related argument I've found tough to deal with. Suppose you have a person who is a

surgeon 

who is so skilled she is the only one who can deal with this particular kind of ailment. There's a

sudden 

outbreak of the ailment. It only takes five minutes for the person to do what they do, but only

they can do 

it. So you could literally have an assembly line because there are so many people struck with this 

ailment, an assembly line of people flowing past this person. So if this person goes to the

bathroom or 

goes to eat a meal or goes to do anything, more people are going to die that would have been saved

had 

she not done that. What's this person supposed to do?</i> </p>

<p>It's like triage. A person is going to have to make an impossible choice among alternatives.

It's easy to 

construct situations like that. That's what they do in philosophy seminars all the time. We don't

agree with 

torture. There was an article in <i>Newsweek</i> by a philosopher whose hidden agenda was that you

shouldn't 

criticize Israel for torturing Arabs. The argument was like an elementary philosophy seminar.

People say 

torture is bad. But is it really bad? Suppose there was a doomsday machine that was about to go

off and 

blow up the universe. There was one person who knew how to stop it, but he wasn't telling us how

to stop it. 

The only way you would get it out of him was by torturing him. Under those circumstances would

torture be 

okay? You say, Okay, under those circumstances. Then, Aha! You're not opposed to torture. Let's

move it a 

little bit over. You get into what's called a &quot;slippery slope argument.&quot; You can play

this game all the time. 

You can make up situations in which usually conflicting values lead to what would ordinarily be

ridiculous 

conclusions under other circumstances. And the trouble is, life often poses such circumstances.

You don't 

have to make them up. The abortion issue is one where life is posing those choices. </p>

<p><i>You think that the choice there isn't that it is or isn't a person. You just basically have

to admit that it's a 

potential person, it's an actual organ in a sense.</i> </p>

<p>We don't have have a clear conception of what a person is. I think a reasonable proposal is

that it changes 

from an organ to a person when it's viable. But that's arguable and it's not very clear when it

is. That's why 

this biologist pointed out it could be when the woman was washing her hands, depending on the

state of 

technology. But that's life. You're faced with hard decisions of conflicting values. </p>

<p><i>Changing gear again: Take the last thirty years, say, from the New Left to the present, and

look at it as a 

span of political activism in the U.S. Leftists seem to do this, as far as I can tell, very

infrequently. Try 

and basically say, What lessons are there in that? Is whatever we achieved the most we could have 

achieved? Did the people who were acting, were they doing basically about as well as one could

expect, 

or were there horrible failures? Was there some impediment that was being overlooked, some

obstacle to 

having greater success that we just didn't think of and we didn't deal with, and had we dealt with

that we 

would have done better? In other words, how do you view the period? Certainly people of my

generation, 

a great many of them, right now are very frustrated. They're feeling like, Thirty years ago I made

this 

choice. It's thirty years later and it hasn't gone where I thought it was going to go.</i> </p>

<p>I think, first of all, where they thought it was going to go was pretty unrealistic. I think if

you look at what's 

happened in thirty years, it's a lot better than it was. A lot of this stuff got started during

the Vietnam War. At 

the ideological level, all of us who were opposed to the war lost flat out within the mainstream

institutions. 

The question now is, have the Vietnamese done enough to compensate us for the crimes that they

committed 

against us? In the newspapers or the journals or the books that's the only question you're allowed

to discuss. 

If you want to be part of the educated culture, the elite culture, the only question you can pose.

I actually have 

been through a lot of the newspapers on this, out of curiosity. Also the POW issue. George Bush

gets up and 

says, The Vietnamese should understand that we bear them no permanent grudge. We're not going to

make 

them pay for everything they did to us. If they finally come clean and devote their entire lives

and every last 

resource they have to searching for the remains of one of those people they viciously blew out of

the sky, 

then maybe we'll allow them entry into the civilized world. And there won't be one editorial

writer or 

columnist who will either fall on the floor laughing or else say, this guy's worse than the Nazis.

Because 

that's the way they all are. The only issue is, Will we forgive them for the crimes they committed

against us? 

So at that level, we just lost the whole discussion. On the other hand, let's go to the general

population. To 

this day, after twenty-five years of this endless, unremitting propaganda, to which no response is

ever 

tolerated, 70% of the population disagrees with the elite culture. That tells you there's a

victory at this level. 

If 70% of the population, after all this brainwashing, still says, as late as 1990, the war was

fundamentally 

wrong and immoral, not a mistake, something got through. </p>

<p><i>Absolutely. And it tells us that for a period of six, seven years, however many years, the

activism that 

people engaged in had a tremendous and long-lasting effect. But it doesn't answer people's concern

that 

after thirty years the size of our organizations, the degree of organized dissent, the ability to

amass new 

movements when new crises arise, or even, much more important, the ability to have sustained 

movements which are striking at ongoing institutional structures, on these axes there doesn't seem

to be 

...</i> </p>

<p>I think that's an inaccurate reading of history. In fact, I think the opposite is the case. The

last big such crisis 

was the Gulf War. I just disagree with a lot of my friends on that one, including most activists

on the left. 

They regarded what happened as a catastrophe for the left, and as a proof of what you just said. I

regard it as 

the opposite. This is the first time in history that I know of that big demonstrations started

before a war. Take 

a look at the Vietnam War. After all, Kennedy started bombing South Vietnam in 1961-62. It was

years 

before there was significant opposition. </p>

<p><i>That was my impression, too. I was incredulous at the speed at which the movement was able

to make 

itself felt, visibly, around the Gulf...</i> </p>

<p>It was unbelievable. The thing that we should remember is, people in power know it. They might

not want us 

to know it, but they know it. It's even clear from their own documents, as well as from what they

do. The day 

the ground combat started in the Gulf War a very important document leaked. It was sort of buried

in the 

papers, and most people missed it. It was the last paragraph of an article on something else. They

leaked an 

early Bush administration planning document on Third World intervention. What it said was--and it

still 

holds--that in the case of confrontations with much weaker enemies--meaning anyone we're willing

to 

fight--we must not only defeat them but we must defeat them decisively and rapidly because

anything else 

will undercut political support. That's a tremendous victory for the left. These guys understand

that they don't 

have the option of carrying out intervention unless they carry out decisive, rapid victories over

totally 

defenseless enemies before anyone notices, after having first demonized them. </p>

<p><i>I agree with you completely about the speed and scale of the response. And yet, it is the

case that you 

describe having to argue with most of your friends. I encountered the same situation. It's a

remarkable 

fact that we don't seem to be able to perceive, as a movement or as a body of people, our own

effectivity.</i> </p>

<p>Of course nobody wants you to see it. In order to perceive it, it's as if you lived in a world

where everybody 

told you--television, radio, books, everything else--that the world is flat. It's Winston Smith in

<i>1984</i>. He's 

trying to hold on to the truth that two plus two equals four. Everybody says two plus two equals

five. He 

remembers inside that two plus two equals four. It's hard to hold on to that truth. Especially

when you're 

isolated. </p>

<p><i>So what's the trick?</i> </p>

<p>The trick is not to be isolated. If you're isolated, like Winston Smith, you're sooner or later

going to break, as 

he finally broke. That was the point of Orwell's story. That's the whole tradition of

totalitarianism: keep 

people isolated and you can get them to believe anything. The genius of American democracy has

been to 

tolerate the formal freedoms that have been won through popular struggle but to eliminate any

substance from 

them by just isolating people. And people are isolated. They're stuck in front of the tube. There

are no 

associations. That's part of the fervor behind getting rid of unions. They're one of the natural

means--not the 

only one--by which ordinary people come together. So you've got to destroy them. That's one of the

reasons 

why it's very important that we have no real political parties, because people could get together

and do stuff. </p>

<p><i>But what it says is that a left which creates a culture and which creates the possibility of

actually 

working together, being friends, communicating with one another will be much less susceptible to

this 

coercion. When I consider now versus thirty years ago, I have this feeling that's there a

fundamental 

change, as atomized as it was then, it's much more so now. People just don't have friends. Nobody

has 

people who they trust, who they're friends with, who they interact with on a regular, ongoing

basis. Not 

nobody, but there's much less of that there was then.</i> </p>

<p>I'm not so sure there's less of it. I suspect that there's probably more of it, but it's in

different circles. So for 

example, take the big movements of the last ... </p>

<p><i>I'm not talking about movements. I'm talking about just normal, everyday life. My parents,

my friends, all 

the people I know.</i> </p>

<p>So what about the people in Witness for Peace, for example? They're mostly church-based, and

their friends 

and associations are usually through churches, often even fundamentalist churches. But they have

real friends 

and associations and work together. </p>

<p><i>That's one of those institutions ...</i> </p>

<p>But these things bring in huge numbers of people. That's why I say I think it's shifted. In

fact, it's shifted 

towards different sectors of the population. In fact, they've become a lot more mainstream. During

the sixties, 

it was kind of kids at universities who were the ones who had these associations and the political

activism 

to a significant extent. There was a lot of that. Not everything, of course, but that was quite a

bit of it. It's 

true, there things have in fact declined. But other parts of society have increased and are

deepened. </p>

<p><i>The left has never offered it per se. The CP did, once upon a time. But the modern left,

from the new left 

to now, has offered rallies and demonstrations. It's offered teach-ins. It's offered talks. But

it's never 

offered ...</i> </p>

<p>What do you call the ... what do you think the right name is for these church-based Central

America 

solidarity groups? Are they &quot;left&quot;? I would call it left. </p>

<p><i>They are setting a better model, perhaps, than anything that the left has had to offer.</i>

</p>

<p>I don't think they're all that separate. A lot of people in them are people who came through

sixties 

experiences, which affected everything. They affected the whole culture very broadly. The reason

that so 

many things grow out of the churches is that that's the one kind of organic institution that

hasn't been 

destroyed. They don't come out of labor unions in the country because we don't have unions. If I

give a talk in 

Europe, up till pretty recently, even now, it could often be in a union hall. Not necessarily

labor people, but 

just community people. I can't remember ever having done that in the U.S. It's usually a church.

That exists. 

That's the one institution that hasn't been destroyed. So that's where things, all the movement

offices are in 

the basement of some church. They're around. </p>

<p><i>That's always been true.</i> </p>

<p>Because that's the only thing that's around. But out of that have come other things, people who

would not 

regard themselves ... they never read a Marxist-Leninist book in their lives and they don't care.

Maybe their 

background is liberation theology. I think that's part of our movement, at least I've always

regarded it that 

way. And the same with people who are involved in all sorts of other issues. </p>

<p><i>To what extent would you consider yourself somehow part of the same movement as

Marxist-Leninists?</i> </p>

<p>There are personal friendships and contacts, but I don't really feel much empathy with it. For

one thing I don't 

understand a lot of it. What I do understand I usually don't like. I don't want to say that I

haven't learned 

anything from them or that I don't hold personal relations; in fact I do support all of the groups

and will 

continue to as long as they do things I like. But I do feel a certain closeness ... the beliefs of

the church-based 

groups are just incomprehensible to me, but I do feel a certain empathy with them that I don't

feel with what 

are called official left groups. </p>

<p><i>You'd rather have them at your side, in some sense.</i> </p>

<p>Yeah. Like when I went down to Nicaragua and I lived in the Jesuit house. I was wondering, What

the heck 

am I doing here? But that's where I felt at home. </p>

<p><i>They were ethical</i>. </p>

<p>Some sort of shared values. For me personally it was sort of weird, because just out of

personal experience, 

aside from having nothing to do with organized religion or anything, I happened to grow up in an

area in 

Philadelphia which was Irish and German Catholic, mostly. We were the only Jewish family around. I

grew 

up with a visceral fear of Catholics. They're the people who beat you up on your way to school. So

I knew 

when they came out of that building down the street, which was the Jesuit school, they were raving 

anti-Semites. So childhood memories took a long time to overcome. </p>

<p><i>As long as we're switching over, we have the church as an institution being a possible place

where people 

can talk, develop ideas, develop agendas. But what about the church as an impediment to social

change?</i> </p>

<p>That's what it's been through most of its history. What was remarkable in the last thirty,

forty, fifty years is a 

radical change in the church, the Catholic Church, and which also showed up in many of the

Protestant 

churches. There was a big change. The reason why the U.S. launched this terrorist war in Central

America 

was to destroy this. People now talk as if the big enemy is Islamic fundamentalism. But they're

forgetting 

something. For the last ten years the big enemy has been the Catholic Church, more of an enemy

than Islamic 

fundamentalism. They had to destroy it. When Americas Watch did their wrap-up study on the 1980s,

they 

pointed out that it was a decade framed by the murder of the Archbishop in 1980 and the murder of

six Jesuit 

intellectuals in 1989. That wasn't accidental. The main target of attack was the church, because

it had 

become a part, not entirely, but part of it had become a church devoted to liberation, to the

poor. Sectors of 

the church did undertake what they called the preferential option for the poor, and very

consciously. They 

recognized that for hundreds of years it had been the church of the rich and the oppressors, who

were telling 

the poor, This is your fate. Accept it. A critically important sector of the church changed,

important enough 

to include the dominant elements among the Latin American bishops, which set off the atrocities

over the last 

ten years, in which the U.S. has vigorously participated. </p>

<p><i>The change is just an accident of history?</i> </p>

<p>I don't know enough about the internal dynamics of it to explain it. </p>

<p><i>What do you think religion is?</i> </p>

<p>Obviously, it means something to people, a lot. It doesn't to me. I don't understand it. I sort

of understand it, 

but I can't empathize with it. To me it's just another set of irrational beliefs. You can believe

this, you can 

believe that if you want. I don't understand why people should need irrational beliefs. Apparently

many 

people seem to find a good deal of fulfillment in it. </p>

<p><i>Including lots of scientists. I was quite struck by that recently, finding all these

physicists, chemists, 

biologists ...</i> </p>

<p>Honestly, I'm pretty skeptical when I read that stuff. </p>

<p><i>Some of those interviews are astounding.</i> </p>

<p>I remember once a close associate of Einstein's once told me, as a sort of a semi-joke,

Einstein was always 

saying famous things ... </p>

<p><i>He always talks about God.</i> </p>

<p>She told me that when he says God he means &quot;I.&quot; &quot;God doesn't play dice with the

cosmos&quot; means &quot;I don't 

believe in this stuff.&quot; When scientists talk about God and this, it reminds me a little bit

of when Robert 

Oppenheimer used to talk about Persian poetry. One of the ways in which scientists try to look

like, well, ... 

if they're not really civilized beings, the way they try to look like civilized beings is by doing

things that they 

think are deep. Like you read Persian poetry or you think about Buddha or something like that. But

that's 

always struck me as something of an affectation. It's striking that this kind of talk about God

was not true of 

the generation of scientists, say, from Boer, Planck, Max Born and Einstein, the great period of

modern 

science. It wasn't true. And there was a level of culture and civilization there that was real,

that was not 

duplicated in twentieth-century America. I think this is true of a lot of things. For example, I

don't think 

people of that generation would have named their particles &quot;quarks,&quot; trying to show how

smart they are 

because they read <i>Finnegan's Wake</i>. They didn't have to show anybody how smart they were.

They were 

smart and cultivated and educated. You didn't have to make everybody remember, He read

<i>Finnegan's 

Wake</i>. </p>

<p><i>Murray Gell Mann is quite smart.</i> </p>

<p>&quot;Smart&quot; and &quot;cultivated&quot; are not the same thing. And it's not a matter of

persons. It's a matter of the whole 

intellectual culture. The intellectual culture of Central Europe. </p>

<p><i>It's also what's supported and what's not.</i> </p>

<p>The intellectual culture of Central Europe out of which a lot of this grew was qualitatively

different from that 

of twentieth-century America. </p>

<p><i>I recently read a book by a guy named Steven Weinberg, who's a Nobel Prize-winning

physicist, very, 

very brilliant. And it is quite fascinating. The book not only makes difficult ideas accessible,

but it's 

written in a very straight-forward way with no pretense. It feels wise, almost elegant in some

sense.</i> </p>

<p>I knew him when he was at MIT, and I felt that. </p>

<p><i>A lot of these guys can write that way, which you don't find coming out of the soft

sciences. You won't find 

an economist writing a book about economics like that.</i> </p>

<p>That's true. First of all, there's not much to say. But it's certainly true. On the other hand,

you were talking 

about the novel ... this turning to divinity, and does the Big Bang tell us something about the

creator. I think 

it's fairly recent in science. It's a pretty common thing. A lot of people write popular books

about science 

now. They think you have to say that. And they didn't think they to say it forty years ago. And

that's a cultural 

change. </p>

<p><i>It is a kind of different dimension, when you're talking forty, fifty years ago and you're

talking about 

particles in the lab. Now they're talking about one-trillionth of a second after the whatever it

was at the 

beginning.</i> </p>

<p>I don't think in terms of a conceptual revolution it's anything like the early quantum theory.

</p>

<p><i>No, it's not</i>. </p>

<p>OK, so why didn't they say it? I think it's because they came from a different intellectual

culture, where you 

didn't have to show that you were capable of dealing with the so-called &quot;big ideas,&quot;

because you were. </p>

<p><i>That's America.</i> </p>

<p>Yeah, I think that's twentieth-century America, a technological civilization. </p>

<p><i>It's remarkable how religious this country is.</i> </p>

<p>It's unbelievable. It's not just that it's religious ... if you look at the comparative

studies, there's a lot of 

comparative studies of religious beliefs. The U.S. is off the chart. It's like a devastated

peasant society. </p>

<p><i>If you watch TV and watch sports events where they interview people after they've done an

event, 

regarding China you hear jokes about how they used to say, I read Mao and he helped me jump and 

taught me how to do this high jump and I won the Olympic event. But that's also the way the

Americans 

sound. Except it's God. The first thing out of their mouth is always, I thank God.</i> </p>

<p>It's shocking, just looking at the studies, which are interesting. I was just looking at one by

Andrew Greeley 

which was a cross-cultural study. It turns out that 75% of Americans literally believe in

religious miracles, 

for example. You can't find that anywhere else. </p>

<p><i>But what does that mean? Deeper, what does it mean if you go up to somebody on the street

and they say, 

I'm one of those 75%? What does that mean?</i> </p>

<p>Either it means that they think they have to say it or they literally believe it. Either way

it's the same. It shows 

that there are features of the society which are off the chart with regard to industrial

societies. I have a 

feeling that it may be related to the sense ... there are other things which are striking, too.

There is an 

increasing sense that nothing is responsive to me. The institutions don't work for me at all. In

fact, that figure 

goes higher and higher every year. It's now hitting over two-thirds of the population, which is

astonishing. 

83% of the population thinks that the entire economic system is inherently unfair. </p>

<p><i>But the two together ... think that the economic system is unfair, they also think that

there's nothing that 

they can do about it.</i> </p>

<p>That's why I think they're connected. </p>

<p><i>Religion is the ...</i> </p>

<p>That's why I say it's like a devastated peasant society. In a society where people feel, I

can't do anything, you 

turn to something supernatural. It's happening in Central America right now. The evangelical

churches 

coming down with the story, Don't worry about this miserable existence. It doesn't matter anyway.

Things 

will be better later. They're gaining considerable success in the wake of murderous destruction of

social 

reform movements. </p>

<p><i>There's an element which makes sense. If you live under those conditions, then they're not

likely to 

change unless you're trying to eke out the best possible existence you can, this kind of

thing.</i> </p>

<p>Maybe. These are phenomena that have been looked at for a long time. Walter Dean Vernon was one

of the 

social scientists who looked at it about ten, twelve years ago. He wrote about back to the

nineteenth century 

there seemed to be a correlation between the lack of, say, worker organization and other popular 

organization in the U.S. and the lack of political differentiation and political ideal and so on

on the one hand 

and the surprising degree of religious commitment on the other. It's possible that they're

correlated. If you go 

back, there are other things to look at. The cheriastic elements in the church, millennial

movements in the 

church, we're on the verge, the Messiah is coming, or wait till the Messiah, that kind of

businesses, did 

regularly arise and was often even stimulated at times of social struggle or the collapse of

social struggle. </p>

<p><i>That's oppression.</i> </p>

<p>That kind of thing. A.P. Thompson writes about that in <i>The Making of the English Working

Class</i> at the 

beginning of the nineteenth century. It goes right through the nineteenth century in the U.S.

Actually, business 

even supported evangelical preachers to try to ... in fact, you see it right now in the Islamic

world. Take 

these 415 people who were kicked out of Israel from Hamas. Israel had supported the Islamic

fundamentalist 

movement openly, as a counterweight to secular nationalism, which is what really bothered them.

They were 

afraid of secular nationalism which would make accommodations, proposals, they would have to deal

with 

these issues politically, which they didn't want to do. It got to the point where they were

literally shipping 

Islamic fundamentalist young people to break up strikes by secular nationalist students on the

West Bank. 

Well, they got what they wanted. Islamic fundamentalists. And it's happening throughout the Arab

world, the 

rise of Islamic fundamentalism, which people talk about as this horrible thing which is very

perplexing. Part 

of it is a reaction to the failure of secular nationalism. That failure has a number of reasons,

one of them 

being Western hostility to it. Sure, you take away people's hopes and they'll turn to something

else. </p>

<p><i>Next time we get together, perhaps we should start there, trying to work through what there

is to be 

hopeful about, what, in more detail, is the goal we are striving for, what, in more detail, are

the 

structures standing between us and that goal, and even, in more detail, what kind of activism and 

organization on our part might overcome those obstacles and attain the sought goals. But, for now, 

Thank you.</i> </p>

<P><H1>Michael Albert and Noam Chomsky</H1>
<H3>Part I</H3>

<P>From <A HREF="http://www.lbbs.org">ZNet</A>

<P><P><TABLE WIDTH=66%><TR><TD>
In January 1993 Michael Albert and Noam Chomsky recorded a series of conversations which were
later distributed by <i>Z Magazine</i>. Here we present a transcription of some material from the 1993 tapes, essentially verbatim, in three parts. Some of the topical material is now historical, of course, but the rest is as timely as when first discussed.
</TABLE>
</CENTER>


<p><i>You once wrote an essay called &quot;Responsibility and Intellectuals&quot;. Perhaps we
could start by talking a 
little bit about that. First of all, what makes a person an intellectual in the first place. What
is an 
intellectual?</i> </p>
<p>It's not a term I take all that seriously. Some of the most intellectual people I've met and
known in my life 
were very remote from the so-called intellectual professions. Plenty of people who are called
intellectual 
workers, who work with their minds, not their, say, hands, are involved in what amounts to
clerical work. 
An awful lot of academic scholarship, for example, is basically a kind of clerical work. </p>
<p><i>Suppose we use the word positively.</i> </p>
<p>With a positive connotation I would want to talk about whoever it is who's thinking about
things, trying to 
understand things, trying to work things out, maybe trying to articulate and express that
understanding to 
others and so on. That's intellectual life. </p>
<p><i>So &quot;things&quot; could be society, it could be quarks ...</i> </p>
<p>It could be music. </p>
<p><i>It could be sports. So basically, arguably, just about everyone.</i> </p>
<p>Except that an awful lot of the activity of most of us is routine, not considered, not directed
to problems that 
really do concern us and not based on efforts, maybe even opportunities to gain deeper
understanding. </p>
<p><i>So intellectuals have a whole lot of time to do this part of life that we all do some of the
time.</i> </p>
<p>There are people who are privileged enough to be able to spend an awful lot of their time and
effort on these 
things if they so choose. They rarely do. They often do turn to routine kind of hack work, which
is the easy 
way. </p>
<p><i>So supposing a society like ours does give some people the opportunity to spend more time
doing 
intellectual work, then I guess that's the context in which we raise the question, What's the
responsibility 
of a person like that, a person who is free to have that time?</i> </p>
<p>We can distinguish what we you might call their &quot;task&quot; from their moral
responsibility. Their task, that is, the 
reason why social institutions provide them with this time and effort, their task is, say, so that
they can 
support power, authority, they can carry out doctrinal management. They can try to ensure that
others 
perceive the world in a way which is supportive of existing authority and privilege. That's their
task. If they 
stop performing their task, they're likely to be deprived of the opportunities to dedicate
themselves to 
intellectual work. On the other hand, their moral responsibility is quite different, in fact,
almost the opposite. 
Their moral responsibility is to try to understand the truth, to try to work with others to come
to an 
understanding of what the world is like, to try to convey that to other people, help them
understand, and lay 
the basis for constructive action. That's their responsibility. But of course there is a conflict.
If you pursue 
the responsibility, you're likely to be denied the privileges of exercising the intellectual
effort. </p>
<p>It's pretty evident, not hard to understand. If you're a young person, say, in college or in
journalism or for that 
matter a fourth grader, and you have too much of an independent mind, meaning you're beginning to
fulfill 
your responsibility, there is a whole variety of devices that will try to deflect you from that
error and, if you 
can't be controlled, to marginalize and eliminate you some way. In fourth grade you may be a
behavior 
problem. In college you may be irresponsible and erratic and not the right kind of student. If you
make it to 
the faculty you'll fail in what's sometimes called &quot;collegiality,&quot; getting along with
your colleagues. If you're a 
young journalist and you're pursuing stories that the managerial level above you understands,
either 
intuitively or explicitly, are not to be pursued, you can be sent off to the police desk and
advised that you are 
not thinking through properly and how you don't have proper standards of objectivity and so on.
There's a 
range of devices. We live in a free society, so you're not sent to the gas chambers. They don't
send the death 
squads after you, as is commonly done in many countries ... you don't have to go very far away to
see that, 
say in Mexico. But there nevertheless are quite successful devices to ensure that doctrinal
correctness is not 
seriously infringed upon. </p>
<p><i>But certainly intellectuals aren't only journalists, economists, political scientists and
the like. That's one 
set in the social sciences. But then there's also hard scientists. There's biologists and
physicists and the 
like. There it would seem that there's less of a social control problem, and so maybe you get a
different 
kind of behavior. Are the intellectuals in the linguistics department comparable to the
intellectuals in the 
economics department?</i> </p>
<p>First of all, there <i>is</i> a social control problem. It's just that we've transcended it.
Galileo faced it, for 
example. You go back a couple of centuries in the West and the social control problem was very
severe. 
Descartes is alleged to have destroyed the final volume of his treatise on the world, the one that
was 
supposed to deal with the human mind, because he learned of the fate of Galileo. That's something
like the 
death squads. The Inquisition was doing precisely that. Okay, that's past, in the West, at least.
Not 
everywhere. </p>
<p><i>Why is it past? In other words, what is it about a society in the West that enables at least
that kind of 
pursuit of knowledge to be free to go wherever it goes, but not in, say, Moslem society?</i> </p>
<p>There are a number of reasons. One of them is just increase in freedom and enlightenment. We've
become a 
much freer society than we were in absolutist times. Popular struggles over centuries have
enlarged the 
domain of freedom. Intellectuals have often played a role in this, during the Enlightenment, for
example, in 
breaking barriers and creating a space for greater freedom of thought. That often took a lot of
courage and 
quite a struggle. And it goes on until today. But there are other factors, too. It's utilitarian.
It turns out that 
with modern science, especially in the last century or two, the ability to gain deeper
understanding of the 
world has interacted critically with modern economic development, modern power. In fact, the
course of 
science and the course of military endeavors is very close, way back to Archimedes. Archimedes was
after 
all designing devices for military purposes. And military technology and science, their history
closely 
interweaves in the modern period, particularly since the mid-nineteenth century. The sciences have
actually 
begun to contribute materially to industrial development. So there are utilitarian purposes, but I
wouldn't 
overexaggerate them. It's like the kind of result that led to freedom in other domains, like
slavery, let's say. 
Or after a hundred and fifty years of American history women were allowed to vote. Things like
that. These 
are significant. </p>
<p>Back to the point, especially after the great scientific revelations of the seventeenth
century, it got to the point 
where you simply couldn't do science if you were subjected to the doctrinal controls that are
quite effective 
outside the hard sciences. You can't do it. You try to be a physicist after Newton spinning off
ideological 
fanaticism, and you're just out of the game. Progress was too much. It's striking. You can see it
right here in 
Cambridge. I've lived here almost all my adult life. There are two major academic institutions
only a couple 
of miles apart. One of them is science and technology based, MIT. The other has sciences of
course, but the 
tone of it is basically humanities and social sciences, Harvard. And the atmosphere is radically
different. </p>
<p>In fact, there is a funny problem in the natural sciences. That is that there is an internal
conflict. The goal, and 
in fact what you're being paid for, to put is crassly, why you're being given the opportunities,
is to find out 
the truth about the world. And you can't do that under doctrinal constraints. So there's a
tension. On the one 
hand it just <i>has</i> to be free, and it just has to encourage independent thought. On the other
hand, people with 
power and authority want it to be constrained. That contradiction is much more striking in the
natural 
sciences than it is in the social sciences or humanities. You can tell falsehoods forever there.
</p>
<p><i>But that implies that in the social sciences and economics and so on, to be crass, what
they're being paid 
for is not to find the truth but something else.</i> </p>
<p>They are performing their role as long as they provide ideological services. To make it simple,
take, say, 
modern economic theory, with its sort of free-market ideology. Planners in business and government
are not 
going to waste their time following those rules. So the U.S. has a steel industry because it
radically violated 
those rules. It was able to recover its steel industry in the last ten years under allegedly
free-market doctrine 
by barring all imports from abroad, by destroying labor unions, so you could wipe down wages, and
just a 
couple of days ago by slamming tariffs up to over 100% on foreign steel. That's planning. On the
other hand, 
the free-market ideology is very useful. It's a weapon against the general population here because
it's a 
weapon against social spending. It's a weapon against poor people abroad, saying, You guys have to
follow 
these rules. As long as the economists are providing what looks like an intellectual basis for
this ideology, 
they're doing their job. You don't have to pay attention to them for actual planning. You can't do
that with 
physics. </p>
<p><i>How does it happen? Here we have students who finish undergraduate work and decide they want
to be 
an economist. So they go to, let's say, Harvard or MIT or some other school in economics.
Presumably 
when they come in they have some notion of doing something that's relevant to society, to making
life a 
little better, something like that, at least a reasonable number of them. When they come out,
they're 
either going to teach at some small community college or they've learned the correct lesson. But
no one 
gets up in front of the class and says, We will henceforth serve the interests of capital.</i>
</p>
<p>It happens in a lot of ways. Let me tell you a story I once heard from a black civil rights
activist who came 
up to Harvard Law School and was there for a while. This must have been twenty years ago. He once
gave a 
talk and said that kids were coming in to Harvard Law School with long hair and backpacks and
social 
ideals and they were all going to go into public service, law and change the world. That's the
first year. He 
said around April the recruiters come for the summer jobs, the Wall Street firms. Get a cushy
summer job 
and make a ton of money. So the students figure, What the heck? I can put on a tie and jacket and
shave for 
one day, because I need that money and why shouldn't I have it? So they put on a tie and a jacket
for that one 
day and they get the job for the summer. Then they go off for the summer and when they come back
in the fall, 
it's ties and jackets and obedience and a shift of ideology. </p>
<p><i>Sometimes it takes two years.</i> </p>
<p>Sometimes it takes two years; that's overdrawing the point. But those factors are very
influential. I've fought 
it all my life. It's extremely easy to be sucked into the dominant culture. It's very appealing.
And the people 
don't look like bad people. You don't want to sit there and insult them. You try to be friends,
and you are. 
You begin to conform, to adapt, to smooth off the harsher edges. Education at a place like Harvard
is in fact 
largely geared to that, to a remarkable extent. I was a graduate student there. There was an
organization 
called the Society of Fellows, which is a research outfit that selects a couple of people from all
fields over 
the year. It was a remarkable opportunity to work. You had all the facilities of Harvard available
and 
basically no responsibilities. Your only responsibilities were to show up for a dinner every
Monday night 
which was sort of modelled on the Oxford-Cambridge high table. You spent the evening at the dinner
with a 
couple of senior faculty members and other distinguished people. The purpose of that was basically 
socialization. You had to learn how to drink port and how to have polite conversations without
talking about 
serious topics, but of course indicating that you could talk about serious topics if you were so
vulgar as to 
actually do it. There's a whole set of mannerisms. In those days you had to learn how to wear
British clothes. 
That was the appropriate affectation. </p>
<p><i>And it's very rare for a person to do all that and not begin to rationalize and think, This
is really pretty 
good. Aren't I something for all this? And to begin to be impressed</i>. </p>
<p>It kind of seeps in. They've had, for example, back in the early forties ... in the 1930s of
course there was 
pretty big labor strife and labor struggle and it scared the daylights out of the business
community because 
labor was actually winning the right to organize and even legislative victories. There were a lot
of efforts to 
overcome this. Harvard played its role. It introduced a trade union program which brought in
rising young 
people in the labor movement, the guy who looks like he's likely to be the local president next
year. They're 
brought to Harvard, they sit in the business school and the dorms. They go through a socialization
process. 
They're brought to share some of the values and an understanding of the elite. They're taught, our
job is to 
work together. We all are together. There are two lines. One line, for the public, is, we're all
together. We're 
all cooperating, joint enterprise, harmony and so on. Of course, meanwhile, business is fighting a
vicious 
class struggle on the side, but that's in a different corner of the universe. That effort to
socialize and integrate 
union activists, I've never measured its success, but I'm sure it was successful. It's pretty much
the way what 
I experienced and saw what a Harvard education. There's much less of that at MIT, naturally, for
exactly the 
reason you said: They're not training the people who are going to rule. </p>
<p><i>It reminds me of 180 degrees opposite, when people started to become politicized in the
early and 
mid-sixties there was an intellectual component that was trying to understand society. There was a
whole 
set of lifestyle acts, ranging from long hair to having a mattress on the floor to various other
kinds of 
behavioral traits. Most parents were sophisticated enough to get much more upset about the
lifestyle acts 
than about the ideas that were being phrased. Because they had a tremendous tenacity. Once you had
a 
community that had these lifestyle ways of behaving and ways of getting along and ways of
identifying 
one another and being part of the same thing, you could escape the more mainstream behaviorisms
far 
more easily. You could look at the accepted roles as being silly or false or whatever, and it was
no longer 
so attractive. That has been absent since about 1970. I don't think the left has had anything much
to 
compete with, the sort of general life definitions of the mainstream and the right. So o the left
you don't 
have a strong lifestyle and an identity to make it easy to ignore the seductions. What you have is
ideals 
but no counteridentity.</i> </p>
<p>That's partly because the alternative lifestyle simply was commercialized and absorbed into the
mainstream 
culture, selling clothes and that sort of thing. </p>
<p><i>That was part of it. It was also partly because the alternative lifestyle was never the
wonderful lifestyle it 
was cut out to be. Instead of defining something positively, it was defined as the opposite of
what is. The 
opposite of something that's horrible isn't always so wonderful. So there were many components of
the 
way we lived and acted in the late sixties that were not very well conceived as ways to live and
act over a 
long period of time. They worked for a time, but over the longer haul they often just weren't very 
fulfilling.</i> </p>
<p>What you're saying is no doubt true. The thing has been commercialized and cheapened. Still,
life's a lot 
easier than it was forty years ago. If I think back to those days, if I look at pictures from the
early 1960s, I 
can hardly believe it, how disciplined everything was, how deep the authority structures were just
in 
personal relations, the way you looked and talked when you went out with your friends. There's
been very 
significant ... I think very good changes as a result of what took place in the 1960s that in turn
spread around 
the whole society. Maybe the spread of some of the gains meant that young dissidents couldn't
identify 
themselves so easily, but it's in part because the society got better. </p>
<p><i>But it's distracting and sort of disturbing. I mean, it's true, and when I talk to students
I try to convey the 
difference between a time when everybody thought that every lawyer was honest and forthright and 
deserved obedience and so on and that doctors were out for nothing except to help humanity, that 
business people cared about consumers, and so on, to a time, now, when people know much more than 
that, to a time, now, when people are sort of passive and laid back. But then it's distracting
that with 
those changes you don't have a parallel change in an organized and aware, self-conscious and
critically 
aware left. On the one hand we do have a lot of left activists. But we don't have something that
is a 
national left.</i> </p>
<p>I agree with you, of course. But it seems to me what's happened, as I try to understand what's
happened since 
the sixties, is that there has been among the general population, excluding those who are
considered 
responsible intellectuals, meaning the ones filling their tasks, excluding power structures and
the 
intellectuals who serve their interests, for the general population, there has been something of
almost a 
revolutionary change in moral values and cultural level and so on, and a great improvement. It has
taken no 
institutional form at all. On the one hand, the ideological institutions are firmly in the hands
of the extremely 
narrow liberal-to-reactionary spectrum, and very tightly controlled. There's no identifiable point
of view or 
ways of thinking or by and large even journals outside them, very little. On the other hand, the
general 
population has become extremely dissident and has absorbed many of the values that people were
struggling 
for in the sixties, and you can see it in just about every area. </p>
<p><i>But the thing that seems to be missing is that then people thought that you could win a
change.</i> </p>
<p>I think they <i>did</i> win a change. </p>
<p><i>Yes, but it was in considerable part because they also believed they could, understood they
could. But 
now people tend not to believe they can, and so have little incentive to try.</i> </p>
<p>I don't think they've recognized what changes are already achieved. If you take almost any area
you think of, 
whether it's race or sex or military intervention, the environment--these are all areas of
awareness and 
concern that didn't exist in the early sixties. You didn't even think about them. You just
submitted, without 
even knowing that you were submitting. You just accepted. And people don't any more. Take the
original sin 
of American history: what happened to the native population. It's a remarkable fact that until the
1960s the 
culture simply couldn't come to terms with it. Not at all. When I grew up, I would go out with my
friends and 
we'd play cowboys and Indians and shoot the Indians. Scholarship was the same. Until the 1960s,
with very 
rare exceptions, academic scholarship was grossly falsifying the history, suppressing the reality
of what 
happened. Even the number of people was radically falsified. As late as 1969, in one of the
leading 
diplomatic histories of the United States, the author Thomas Wally could write that after the
Revolution &quot;the 
colonists turned to the task of felling trees and Indians.&quot; Nobody could say that now. You
couldn't even say 
that in a <i>Wall Street Journal</i> editorial. Those are really important changes. </p>
<p><i>But somehow it's as if, in a phrase I once heard, we snatched defeat from the jaws of
victory. People have 
this perception of accomplishing nothing or very, very little, and begin to get burned out and to
retain 
some of the values and commitments but begin to feel that you can no longer really struggle for
change 
bcause we're not succeeding. This is a common sentiment. It's certainly a common sentiment among 
people I know, not always voiced, I think, but there. And yet if you look objectively at the
thing, like 
you're trying to do now, you see that if you don't have an outrageously inflated view of how fast
change 
takes place, then you can understand that change has been dramatic. It isn't so obvious what the 
mechanism is that causes people to be so oblivious to their own effects.</i> </p>
<p>Partly it's that there's nothing in the official culture that's ever going to tell you you
succeeded. It's always 
going to tell you you failed. The official view of the sixties is it's a bunch of crazies running
around burning 
down universities and making noise because they were hysterics or were afraid to go to Vietnam or 
something. That's the official story. That's what people hear. They may know in their lives and
experience 
that that's not what happened. But they don't hear anybody say it, unless they're in activist
groups. That 
change is possible, that it has been won, is not the message that the system is pouring into you
through 
television and radio and newspapers and books and histories and so on. It's sort of beating into
your head 
another story. The other story is you failed, and you should have failed, because you were just a
bunch of 
crazies. And it's natural that the official culture should take that view. It does not want people
to understand 
that you can make changes. That's the last thing it wants people to understand. So, what the
mainstream media 
conveys is that if there have been changes, it's because we, the elites, are so great that we
carried through the 
changes. </p>
<p><i>But there's an element of truth in that, though perverse. Of course, short of a revolution
any change that 
occurs is going to occur how? Immediately, because an elite makes a decision to enact a change.
They're 
going to make the decision because of the pressures of social movements. But they are in a
position to 
deny the influence of the movements and claim credit for themselves down the road a ways.</i> </p>
<p>But really, they bowed to pressures. </p>
<p><i>That's right. When you read the histories, they don't talk about the pressures from social
movements. 
Instead elites simply talk about their profound wisdom in taking this next step.</i> </p>
<p>We ended slavery because we were such great figures that we decided that we didn't like
slavery. </p>
<p><i>And the real cause of it is gone.</i> </p>
<p>Let's say the slave revolts. </p>
<p><i>That's gone</i>. </p>
<p>And sure, we saw that on a not trivial scale in the last thirty years. So this combination of a
kind of a, in my 
opinion, really close to revolutionary change in moral values and cultural level has gone on
without any 
lasting institutional change. </p>
<p>And the lack of institutional support for the changes in ideas and values allows the official
culture to drive 
home its message, which is, you guys are worthless and can't do anything, why don't you just shut
up and go 
home? And steadily they undermine the progress. </p>
<p><i>I want to go into some of that when we talk about movements and what should happen. But
let's just go 
back to this broad question of intellectuals. What about left intellectuals? If an intellectual is
somebody 
who spends time trying to understand, and a social intellectual tries to understand society,
what's a left 
intellectual? Are there any?</i> </p>
<p>I've never been very happy about words like &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right,&quot; but let's
use it in the conventional sense. One 
of the very few predictions in the social sciences that I know of that ever came true was one of
Bakunin's 
over a century ago in which he talked about what the intellectuals were going to be like in modern
industrial 
society. He predicted that they would fall into two categories. There would be the left
intellectual. They 
would be the ones who would try to rise to power on the backs of mass popular movements, and if
they 
could gain power they would then beat the people into submission. </p>
<p><i>Leninism.</i> </p>
<p>Yes, what he was predicting was Leninism. And if the inelletuals find that they can't do that,
or that it is too 
dangerous or costly, they'll be the servants of what we would nowadays call state capitalism. He
didn't use 
the term. Either of the two intellectuals, he said, will be &quot;beating the people with the
people's stick.&quot; That is, 
they will still be presenting themselves as representatives of the people, so they'll hold the
people's stick, 
but they'll be beating the people with it. He didn't go on with this, but I think that his
analysis has turned out 
to be true. And it follows from his analysis that it would likely be extremely easy to shift from
one position 
to the other. It's extremely easy, that is, to undergo what nowadays is called the
&quot;God-that-failed&quot; syndrome. 
You start off as basically a Leninist, someone who is going to be part of the Red bureaucracy. You
see later 
that power doesn't lie that way, and you very quickly become an ideologist of the right and you
devote your 
life to exposing the sins of your former comrades who haven't seen the light and haven't shifted
to where 
power really is. In fact, we're seeing it right now in the Soviet Union. The same guys who were
Communist 
thugs, Stalinist thugs two years back, are now running banks and enthusiastic free marketeers and
praising 
Americans. </p>
<p><i>It doesn't take a long indoctrination period to learn the new style.</i> </p>
<p>And this has been going on for forty years. It's become a kind of a joke. Where does that leave
what you 
might call &quot;honest intellectuals&quot;? They're usually outside the system, for good reasons.
There is no reason to 
expect institutions of power and domination to tolerate people trying to undermine them. Quite the
opposite. 
So therefore you quite typically find the honest and serious intellectuals, people who are
commited to, I 
think, enlightenment values, values of truth, freedom, liberty, and justice, there would be major
efforts made 
to marginalize them. </p>
<p><i>Who are they?</i> </p>
<p>All the people who have done anything that's ... </p>
<p><i>Who, which people, groups?</i> </p>
<p>Take, say, the SNCC activists. They were serious intellectuals. They made a big change in the
world. The 
people of your generation, who did the work that led to the changes we spoke of earlier... work
that didn't 
just mean running around the streets waving signs. It also meant thinking about things and
figuring out what 
the problems were. Those people made a change. A certain number of them did filter their way into
the 
institutions. For example, if you take universities or newspapers or television today, you usually
find people 
in there, almost always, who have been through those experiences and have remained true to them.
They've 
got to adapt their behavior in various ways to get by. But many of them do it very
self-consciously, very 
honestly and even very constructively. So there's a kind of an honest intelligentsia if you like,
meaning not 
serving power, either as Red bureaucracy or as state capitalist, commissar equivalents. Such
people exist, 
sometimes in the institutions, but most of the time out of them, for almost trivial reasons. The
institutions are 
simply not going to welcome serious critics. They're constructed in such a way as to make it
difficult or 
impossible for people who are going to undermine those institutions to survive. How could it be
otherwise? 
It's just like you're not going to find a militant labor activist as chairman of the board of
General Electric. 
How could it be? </p>
<p><i>It seems straightforward to me as well. But we come to the question, are there some left
intellectuals who 
rise to a position of relative prominence, so they're visible. SNCC activists are anonymous, in a
sense, 
socially anonymous.</i> </p>
<p>They're marginalized, but they're important. Some of them are still around, doing important
things. </p>
<p><i>But in a sense it's an activist group who is not highlighted and made publicly visible. And
some leaders 
might be.</i> </p>
<p>Like Rosa Luxemburg, say, who got killed. </p>
<p><i>Right. So there's a figure in history who we could say, She's one of the people who I would
pick...</i> </p>
<p>She was murdered. That's the point. </p>
<p><i>Typical. This raises the question, Can we only find dead ...?</i> </p>
<p>No. First of all, if you look back through history ... </p>
<p><i>Let's look now.</i> </p>
<p>Now? You find people all over. It's claimed now that there's less of a left intelligentsia than
there was thirty 
years ago. I don't believe a word of it. Take a look at the people who they're calling the left,
the big thinkers 
of the 1950s. Who were they? They were intelligent people. Ed Wilson is an intelligent person, but
a left 
intellectual? Mary McCarthy? A smart person who wrote some nice novels. But not a left
intellectual. In 
fact, what you have now is much more serious activists in many more places. I travel all the time
and give 
talks all over the place. I've been amazed to go to places throughout the 1980s ... take, say, the
Central 
America solidarity movement, which I think is a pretty dramatic development. I don't think there's
been 
anything like it in history. I'd go to a church in Kansas or a town in Montana or Wyoming or
Anchorage, 
Alaska and find people who knew more about Latin America, certainly, than the CIA, which is not
very hard, 
but people in academic departments who've thought about it, who understood things about American
policy. </p>
<p>I can't even tell you their names. There are too many of them. Also, I'm not even sure that the
word &quot;left&quot; is 
the right word for them. A lot of them were probably Christian conservatives, but they were very
radical 
people in my view. Intellectuals who understood and who did a lot. They created a popular movement
which 
not only protested U.S. atrocities but actually engaged themselves in the lives of the victims. In
the 1960s 
nobody ever dreamt of going off to a Vietnamese village because maybe a white face in the village
would 
limit the capacity of the marauders to kill and destroy. That wasn't even an idea in your head. In
fact, nobody 
even went to try to report the war from the side of the victims. It was unheard of, save for a few
&quot;crazies.&quot; 
But in the eighties it was common. And the people who were doing that are serious left
intellectuals, in my 
view. </p>
<p><i>So if a person comes along and says the left intellectual community is gutted, there's very
little of it, what 
they must in fact be saying is something like--the number of people who call themselves leftist
and who 
are visibly notable is small. Which, of course, in your analysis may well be an indication that
there's a 
growing left intellectual community which is, of course, being isolated and not labeled anything
publicly 
and not given any public visibility.</i> </p>
<p>That's right. What will be labeled &quot;left&quot; and given publicity is something ugly
enough that people can be 
rallied to oppose it. So Stalinism, for example. Books will come out, and are coming out, about
the left 
intellectuals in France who were Stalinists. And look at the awful things they did. That kind of
left 
intelligentsia is allowed to have publicity and prominence. They give them as much prominence as
they can. </p>
<p><i>It's useful.</i> </p>
<p>But if by left you mean people who are struggling for peace and justice and freedom and human
rights and so 
on, and for social change and elimination of authority structures, whether it's personal life or
institutions or 
whatever, if that's what the left is, there are more of them around than I remember in my
lifetime. </p>
<p><i>In coming to this kind of perception of the thing, you have a real advantage, you
personally, relatively 
speaking. You personally, as compared to one of those individuals, do have a lot of the visibility
and a lot 
of the access that somebody might attribute as the critical ingredient needed to impact on a wide 
audience in our society. These other people feel isolated. They feel relatively uninfluential or
unable to 
express their opinions to a wider audience.</i> </p>
<p>Visibility, that's putting the cart before the horse. The reason I have visibility is because
there are a lot of 
people around, a lot of groups around, who come and ask me to speak, or because people ask me to
write. I 
don't have visibility in the mainstream institutions. </p>
<p><i>But there has to be a distinction between you and those people you mentioned in Omaha or
Anchorage or 
wherever who may know more than you, or at least a lot, about Central America and who are never
asked 
to speak.</i> </p>
<p>We pick different ways of living our lives. In the early sixties, I was an MIT professor. But
when I started 
giving talks about the war or organizing tax resistance or getting involved in the foundation of
RESIST, 
national resistance support groups, or being faculty advisor for the Rosa Luxemburg SDS at MIT, I
didn't 
have any visibility. There are choices to be made. Some of my close friends who have the same
status and 
chance for visibility that I had actually picked a different way and devoted their lives to
organizing and 
activism. Louis Kampf and I are old friends. We taught courses together for years at MIT, courses
which you 
took years ago. We just went different ways. He devoted himself primarily to real activism and
organizing 
and keeping groups and journals functioning and so on. I tried that and I wasn't any good at it. I
found that I 
was much better at other things, and that there seemed to be a demand for the other things, so I
just went that 
way. That ends up in me being visible. He's visible in other circles than the ones that I'm
visible in. But 
those are just different ways of reacting to the same sorts of problems, depending on your
personality and 
your particular abilities and the kinds of things you can do and the kinds of things you can't do
and so on and 
so forth. The visibility is a surface phenomenon. Visibility is the result of the existence of an
active, lively 
left. If what I've been talking about as the left were to disappear, I would no longer be visible.
</p>
<p><i>As a political commentator.</i> </p>
<p>Yes, I could still appear in linguistics and philosophy meetings, but I would certainly not be
visible as a 
political commentator, because there would be nowhere for me to open my mouth except to my
friends. It 
would be back to the early sixties, when I could talk to people in the living room. The reason
that it has 
changed is because there are opportunities that in fact call for this kind of participation, so
that makes people 
look visible. We mentioned SNCC before. Why did Martin Luther King become visible? Because there
were 
SNCC workers down in the South. And he could appear and serve a role for them. </p>
<p><i>It seems to me there is a positive and negative side to that. The positive side you've
described: there's a 
political context and it draws people in different ways and people participate. But the negative
side 
seems to me to be, you gave the example of Martin Luther King and yourself. There's a need for a 
particular visible organizer or a particular visible speaker and proselytizer of information, a
presenter 
of information. But once those slots are filled, then there's a tendency for people to cling to
the 
individuals who are filling those slots. For a long period of time, depending on a number of
factors, the 
number of slots might not broaden out. Nowadays if a group in Cleveland or in San Francisco or 
wherever wants an antiwar speaker during the Gulf crisis or wants a speaker about foreign policy,
very 
few names pop into mind. Whereas I think you're right, there is a much larger circuit of people, 
especially if they had the experience of engaging in those activities, who could fill the bill.
That seems to 
me to be not so positive a dynamic.</i> </p>
<p>It's not. It's hard to break through. There are people who we know in fact who are highly
qualified to do lots 
of things and are eager to do it but sort of can't pass over that barrier. I don't know exactly
what the reason 
for that is, frankly, because all of us had to pass over that barrier at some point. Part of the
reason is, the fact 
of the matter is there haven't been a lot of people available. Take, say, the last ten years, when
there's been a 
lot of activism, a lot of it having to do with Latin America. There just haven't been a lot of
people around 
who were willing to go and give talks. There are plenty of people who are willing to write
articles on 
postmodernism and the left this and that or whatever, but not many who are willing to go to a town 
somewhere and give a talk at a meeting. We can name them. </p>
<p><i>Or we can name the ones we know, but it may well be there are a good many more and we can't
name 
them. That's the problem.</i> </p>
<p>There are a good many more who would be highly qualified and maybe even would like to do it.
The 
question we're asking, and I don't know what the answer is, is how come they don't. First of all,
I don't think 
it's all that hard. Take, say, people who weren't known very well, like Holly Sklar, who probably
wasn't 
known fifteen years ago. She got plenty of invitations all over the place. She became visible.
There are 
others like her. Take my friend Norman Finkelstein on the Middle East. He can get plenty of
invitations to 
speak. He's been totally shut out of the institutions, but he's visible if he wants. It can be
done. It's not so 
simple. </p>
<p><i>It's somewhat difficult. I do think that there's a dynamic there that closes it off.</i>
</p>
<p>The bad dynamic, what you're pointing to, is the &quot;star story. It's standard when a popular
movement takes off 
for people to show up and say, OK, I'm your leader. A Eugene McCarthy type, say. Here's a big
popular 
movement. Fine. I'm your leader. Give me power. If you can't give me power I'll go home and write
poetry 
and talk about baseball. And if you can give me power then I become your leader and now you look
up to me 
and you go home and put the power in my hand. That's a familiar dynamic, and Bakunin's Red
bureaucracy, 
no matter what its politics are. It could be right wing, it could be left wing. But there's a
better dynamic, 
which is that the popular movements continue and strengthen, and where there are people around
who, for 
whatever reason or quirk or privilege or whatever it may be, can contribute to them by
intellectual activity, 
they do a part of it. That's all. They're not stars. They're not leaders. They're just
contributing in the way that 
they know how to contribute. That would be a better structure. But it can tend to degenerate into
this other 
very quickly, especially in a culture which is reinforcing their worst tendencies by trying to
create an 
imagery of leadership and stars and heroes and so on. </p>

<P><H1>Michael Albert and Noam Chomsky</H1>
<H3>Part II</H3>

<P>From <A HREF="http://www.lbbs.org">ZNet</A>

<P><P><TABLE WIDTH=66%><TR><TD>
In January 1993 Michael Albert and Noam Chomsky recorded a series of conversations which were
later distributed by <i>Z Magazine</i>. Here we present a transcription of some material from the 1993 tapes, essentially verbatim, in three parts. Some of the topical material is now historical, of course, but the rest is as timely as when first discussed.
</TABLE>
</CENTER>

<p><i>Suppose somebody could convince you, at the level of your belief in most things, that 
it's impossible to change the country. Suppose they convinced you that the basic 
institutional structure that we have now is going to be in place for the next two 
hundred years, adapted sure, but the basic structures as they are. Would you behave 
any differently?</i> </p>
<p>Zero. </p>
<p><i>You would behave exactly the same way.</i> </p>
<p>The same way. In fact, you don't even have to make it hypothetical. When I got 
seriously involved in anti-Vietnam War activities, I was a hundred percent convinced 
that absolutely nothing could be done, and there was plenty of reason to believe 
that. I was giving plenty of talks, but they were usually in living rooms to a group 
of neighbors that somebody would get together. They were usually pretty hostile. Or 
in a church where there would be four people including some guy who wandered in 
because he didn't know what to do, and two people who wanted to kill you, and the 
organizer. Into 1965 and 1966, if we wanted to have at MIT an antiwar meeting, we 
would have to find six topics. Let's talk about Venezuela, Iran, Vietnam and the 
price of bread, and maybe we can get an audience that will outnumber the organizers. 
And that went on for a long time. As you well remember, it was impossible to have a 
public meeting in Boston without it being smashed up. It looked impossible. </p>
<p><i>If you thought this was going to continue forever, you would still do it. I think it 
would be useful to explain why. </i></p>
<p>A number of quite simple reasons. For one thing, if somebody convinced me, it would 
be because I'm totally irrational. There's no way you could convince anybody of such 
things rationally. We cannot predict the weather two weeks ahead, and we even 
understand why we can't. </p>
<p><i>It's a hypothetical question. It gets to motivations. Obviously neither one of us 
believe it, and neither one of us believe you could prove it. You couldn't convince 
anybody rational of it.</i> </p>
<p>You couldn't say anything convincing about it. </p>
<p><i>Nevertheless, supposing because a great many people not understanding that point, do 
feel this way or tend to feel this way sometimes and get depressed at moments. The 
question is, in any event, what gets you up each morning to do the things that you 
do? Is it that you think in terms of winning a little ways down the road, or is it 
something else?</i> </p>
<p>It's hard to introspect, but to the extent that I introspect about it, it's because 
you basically have two choices. One choice is to assume the worst, and then you can 
be guaranteed that it will happen. The other is to assume that there is hope for 
change, and then it's possible that by acting you will help effect change. So you've 
got two choices. One guarantees that the worst will happen. The other leaves open the 
possibility that things might be better. Given those two choices, a rational person 
doesn't hesitate. </p>
<p><i>I used to think about this back when I was becoming political, in the mid-sixties. I 
played the hypothetical game a little more fairly than I think you are right now. I 
said to myself, OK, suppose it's haves and have-nots. Not very many haves, a whole 
lot of have-nots. Forever. Which side do you want to be on? And it's not an easy 
question. At the time it was trivial. In the sixties, that was an easy question to 
answer. You wanted to be on the side of the have-nots regardless of prospects. I 
think this had a lot to do with lifestyle and values and who you identify with. The 
other stuff, being a have, just wasn't attractive. Now I think it's a much harder 
question. But that's one kind of motivation that people can have for being radical. 
The other kind of motivation that people can have for being radical is the 
inclination that you're going to win tomorrow or in your lifetime or in a reasonable 
span of time. It seems like the first motivation breeds a different kind of person in 
some sense than the second. They're called purists, morally motivated, ethically 
motivated, and scorned a bit by some of the other types, with some reason. 
Because--and this was the other thing that I began to realize early on--trying to 
make social change isn't like trying to play socialist basketball. In working for 
social change, the score counts. It doesn't do to play well or congenially but lose. 
The combination of both of those motivations--scorning being a have but also 
seriously wanting to win--in one person seems to me to be rather difficult.</i> </p>
<p>You mentioned two possibilities. One is a description of your own group's experience 
in the sixties. You didn't expect to win a huge victory tomorrow. Some people 
expected we'll go out and strike at Columbia ... And everybody will love each other 
and that's the end of power. We both know perfectly well that plenty of people 
believed that. There were other people who recognized it was going to be a long 
struggle but who were joining with like-minded people who shared their cultural 
values and their lifestyle and everything else. There's also a third type: You've got 
me. I was not part of the cultural scene. I certainly didn't expect a quick victory. 
I kept my old-fashioned bourgeois lifestyle, and I haven't changed it to this day. 
And there are people like that too. If we go on there are many more types of people. 
People can come in a lot of varieties. But it seems to me that it always comes down 
to the individual decision: What am I going to do? Here are my options. Of course, my 
personal options are broader than those of most other people, because I happen to be 
very privileged. But everybody's got some option. You ask yourself, Will I not use 
them at all? In which case I can be sure that suffering will continue and oppression 
will continue and discrimination will continue and get worse. Or will I use whatever 
options I have, try to work with others to change things? In which case things may 
get better. It seems to me that ultimately that's what things come down to, no matter 
who we are. And given those choices, a decent person is only going to go one way. 
That's exactly why society and the official culture doesn't want you to understand 
that you have those choices. </p>
<p><i>Is that true that a decent person's only going to go one way? I'm remembering a 
friend of mine who was an organizer in the sixties. We went through the antiwar 
movement. Then came a little bit further along and there was a trend toward doing 
community organizing, moving into a neighborhood, trying to organize people in that 
neighborhood. This individual was going to move into a neighborhood in Dorchester, in 
Boston, a working-class area and try and do organizing. He finally decided not to do 
it and somewhat later went back to graduate school and then became a psychiatrist and 
now, I'm sure, has progressive values at some level--I haven't seen him in years and 
years--but is certainly not involved in any significant way in political activity. 
The choice that he made was a very self-conscious one. He looked around him and he 
said, the impact that I personally am going to have is so small because I'm not so 
and so or so and so, he'd name some other people who had prospects of maybe in his 
eyes having more impact, because of whatever set of factors about, so that it simply 
isn't worth giving up what I think I'm giving up.</i> </p>
<p>I don't know who you mean, but I know plenty of people like that. That person now, 
let's say he's a rich psychiatrist somewhere ... </p>
<p><i>He's probably reasonably well off.</i> </p>
<p>He's got a lot of options. For example, he's got money. </p>
<p><i>This is like a person going to Harvard Law School. The probability that he'll do 
something good with his income after the years of earning it...</i> </p>
<p>I agree. But he's simply deciding at some point not to face the options. He's always 
got them. He may decide, Look, I can't make enough of a change myself because I'm not 
good at it or whatever, so I'm just going to do what I like and enrich myself. But 
having done so, you still have plenty of options available. In fact, movement groups 
have existed in part because people who were doing other things were willing to fund 
them. Something as trivial as that. You can go way beyond that, of course, and still 
live your elegant lifestyle and do the work you want. We know people who have divided 
their lives that way. Of course it's extremely easy to say, the heck with it. I'm 
just going to adapt myself to the structures of power and authority and do the best I 
can within them. Sure, you can do that. But that's not acting like a decent person. 
You can walk down the street and be hungry. You see a kid eating an ice cream cone 
and you notice there's no cop around and you can take the ice cream cone from him 
because you're bigger and walk away. You can do that. Probably there are people who 
do. We call them &quot;pathological.&quot; On the other hand, if they do it within existing 
social structures we call them &quot;normal.&quot; But it's just as pathological. It's just the 
pathology of the general society. And people, again, always have choices. We're free 
people. You can decide to accept that pathology, but then do it honestly, at least, 
if you have that grain of honesty to say, I'm going to honestly be pathological. Or 
else try to break out of it somehow. </p>
<p><i>But for a lot of people I think it appears that there's an all-or-nothing choice. It 
appears that there's the choice of being normal--pathological as you describe, but a 
normal member of society with its normal benefits and costs and so on, but at least a 
reasonably average or perhaps elite existence that's accepted. Then there seems to be 
another &quot;all&quot; choice, to be a raging revolutionary. The reason why it's so hard for 
many people even just to take a leaflet from a protester, or to give a donation at a 
relatively low level which means nothing financially, which is less money than 
they're going to spend on dinner on Friday night when they go out, or to do some 
other act that is materially trivial, seems to be because there's a psychologically 
really powerful effect. The effect seems to me to be that at some level people know 
that to dissent is right, and at some level people know that to do it somewhat leads 
to doing it still more, so they defensively close the door right at the very 
beginning. They have a very hard time finding a place in that span of possible 
involvement that allows them to be a functioning human being with a degree of 
fulfillment in society and also lets them contribute to dramatically changing 
society.</i> </p>
<p>You're right. Just giving your contribution of $100 to the Central America support 
center or whatever is a statement that you know that that's the right thing to do. 
Once you've stated it's the right thing to do, how come I'm only doing this limited 
thing since I could do a million times more? It's easier to say, I'm not going to 
face that problem at all. I'm just going to forget it entirely. But that's like 
stealing the ice cream cone from the kid. </p>
<p><i>But it says something to the left, or to movements and to organizers. It is at some 
level unreasonable to think that in the absence of hope or in the presence only of 
small hope and not a clear understanding of how one's going to make progress, that 
people are going to shift all the way from being average, normal, everyday folks of 
one type or another over to being political revolutionaries, people who see things in 
political terms. If there's no set of choices in the middle that are comfortable and 
that allow people to operate and to retain some of their lifestyle, then it's not 
likely that too many are going to do anything. You almost have to be religious to 
make the jump.</i> </p>
<p>But the reality is there's a whole range of choices in the middle. </p>
<p><i>But people don't see them.</i> </p>
<p>And all of us have made them. None of us are saints, at least I'm not. I haven't 
given up my house, my car, I don't live in a hovel. I don't spent 24 hours a day 
working for the benefit of the human race or anything like that. I don't even come 
close. I spend an awful lot of my time and energy ... </p>
<p><i>And you don't feel guilty about whatever else is it that you're doing, linguistics or 
...</i> </p>
<p>That's not so clear. But at least I certainly devote an awful lot of my energy and 
activity to things that I just enjoy, like scientific work. I just like it. I do it 
out of pleasure. And everybody else I know ... </p>
<p><i>Do you fool yourself into believing that doing that increases your effectiveness as a 
political person?</i> </p>
<p>No, that's ridiculous. It has no effect on it. And I don't do it for that reason. I 
like it. I mean, I can make up a story ... </p>
<p><i>I think people have a hard time doing this. And that's why a lot of people do nothing 
politically dissident.</i> </p>
<p>That's true, but if we were to go back to that small class of people who are visible, 
every one of them does this. Every single one. </p>
<p><i>Almost by definition.</i> </p>
<p>Because you're not going to be effective as a political activist unless you have a 
satisfying life. There may be people who are really saints. I've never heard of one. </p>
<p><i>By definition they're not saints, because they're getting so much satisfaction out of 
the political activity, they're not saintly at it.</i> </p>
<p>Not from the political activity. It may be that the political activities themselves 
are so gratifying that's all you want to do, so you throw yourself into that. That's 
a perfectly fine thing to be. It's just that most people have other interests. They 
want to listen to music. They want to take a walk by the ocean. Any human being is 
too rich and complex to be just satisfied with these things. You have to hit some 
kind of a balance. The choices are all there. And I think you've identified precisely 
why it's psychologically difficult for people to recognize that choices are there. 
Because once you recognize that the choices are there, you're always going to be 
faced with the question, why am I not doing more? But that's the reality of life. If 
you're honest, you're always going to be faced with those questions. And there's 
plenty to do. In fact, if you look back over the last period, there's a lot of 
successes to point to. It's amazing how many successes there are if you really think 
about it. Take something which very few people have been interested in. Take the 
issue of East Timor, the massacre. I got involved in that about fifteen years ago. 
People didn't even want to hear about it. Things finally got to the point where the 
U.S. Congress barred military aid to Indonesia. That's a tremendous change. You could 
save hundreds of thousands of lives that way. How many people can look back and say, 
Look, I helped save hundreds of thousands of lives? And that's one tiny issue. </p>
<p><i>I'm inclined to think that most of the people who are involved in that effort, 
instead of feeling elated or feeling at least a degree of satisfaction over their 
accomplishment, rather probably view it as a horrendously long campaign with very 
little achieved. It's like looking at the milk glass and saying it's half empty 
instead of half full. Except we see it empty even when it's almost full.</i> </p>
<p>Suppose you're on your deathbed. How many people can look back and say, I've 
contributed to helping ... just one person not get killed? </p>
<p><i>I'm not disagreeing with you. I think you're right, clearly. But there's something 
that causes people, maybe it's something about our culture, to not see it.</i> </p>
<p>I'm not so convinced of this. The sixties movements, roughly speaking, were almost 
overwhelmingly young people. Young people have a notoriously short perspective. It's 
part of being twenty years old. You don't think what's going to happen tomorrow. I've 
seen it around students, around children, even. I remember myself. You don't think 
what's life going to be like twenty years from now. Your perspective is short. The 
fact that it was a youth movement dominantly had good and bad aspects. One bad aspect 
was this sense that if we don't achieve gains quickly we might as well quit. But of 
course that's not the way changes come. The struggle against slavery, let's say, went 
on forever. The struggle for women's rights has been going on for a century. The 
effort to overcome wage slavery, that's been going on since the beginnings of the 
Industrial Revolution, and we haven't advanced an inch. In fact, we are worse off 
than a hundred years ago in terms of understanding the issues. Well, OK, you just 
keep struggling. </p>
<p><i>Let's go back to one of the things that you mentioned along the way when you were 
talking about academics and what role they play and what they're doing and what their 
time goes to. You brought up briefly in passing postmodernism and these various 
other--either you can call them insightful forays into knowledge, or fads. I know, 
and probably most people listening know, at least somewhat, about your reaction to 
it. But let's go over it anyway. Where does it come from? Why does a person who has a 
tremendous amount of educational background, knowledge, experience, time to 
spend--spend it on something akin to astrology?</i> </p>
<p>I don't want to overgeneralize. I think there is important and insightful work done 
in those frameworks. I find it really hard to figure out because I've got to labor to 
try to tease the simple, interesting points out. But there are things there. I think 
we're making progress there. But I think there's a point that's much more general. 
The fact is, it's extremely hard to have good ideas. There are very few of them 
around. If you're in the sciences, you know you can sometimes come up with something 
that's pretty startling and it's usually something that's small in comparison with 
what's known and you're really excited about it. Outside the natural sciences it's 
extremely hard to do even that. There just isn't that much that's complicated that's 
at all understood outside of pretty much the core natural sciences. Everything else 
is either too hard for us to understand or pretty easy. </p>
<p><i>So suppose you're making $50,000 a year as a academic in that field?</i> </p>
<p>You've got to have a reason for your existence. The result is that simple ideas are 
dressed up in extremely complex terminology and frameworks. In part it's just 
careerism, or maybe an effort to build self-respect. Take, say, what's called 
&quot;literary theory.&quot; I don't think there's any such thing as literary theory, any more 
than there's cultural theory. </p>
<p><i>And obviously you can read a book and talk about it.</i> </p>
<p>Yeah, if you're reading books and talking about them and getting people to ... </p>
<p><i>You could be very good at that.</i> </p>
<p>You could be terrific at it. Take, say, Edmund Wilson. He's terrific at it. But he 
doesn't have a literary theory. On the other hand, if you want to be in the same room 
with that physicist over there who's talking about quarks, you better have a 
complicated theory, too, that nobody can understand. He has a theory that nobody can 
understand, so why shouldn't I have a theory that nobody can understand? </p>
<p><i>The interesting thing is that the physicist will write about that theory in a popular 
book and explain it without a whole lot of rigmarole. It won't all be explained, but 
a great deal of it will be.</i> </p>
<p>A great physicist of the modern period could write a book that you could give to your 
twelve-year-old kid and she'll understand it and learn something from it. In fact, I 
see it myself all the time. </p>
<p><i>What's the reason why literary theorists can't do that? Is it because there's nothing 
there?</i> </p>
<p>That's my assumption. Either there's something there that's so deep that it's a kind 
of qualitative change in human intelligence, or there isn't a lot there. And it's not 
just literary theory. If somebody came along with a theory of history, it would be 
the same. &quot;Theory&quot; would be a sort of truism. Maybe &quot;smart ideas.&quot; Somebody
could 
have smart ideas and say, Why don't you look at class struggle? It's interesting. Or, 
Why don't you look at economic factors lying behind the Constitution? Pick your 
topic. Those are interesting smart ideas. But you can say them in monosyllables. And 
it's rare outside the natural sciences to find things that can't be said in 
monosyllables. There are interesting, simple ideas. They're often hard to come up 
with, and they're often extremely hard to work out. Like you want to try to 
understand what actually happened, say, in the modern industrial economy and how it 
developed the way it is. That can take a lot of work. But there isn't going to be 
anything too complex to talk about ... the theory will be extremely thin, if by 
&quot;theory&quot; we mean something with principles which are not obvious when you look at 
them from which you can deduce surprising consequences, check out the consequences, 
and then confirm the principles. You're not going to find anything like that. </p>
<p><i>So we can imagine two libraries, a library of literary theory books, postmodernism 
and so on, and another library over here with Marxist/Leninist books in essentially 
the same building.</i> </p>
<p>I don't understand that either. I read all kinds of things which talk about 
dialectical materialism. I haven't the foggiest idea what it is. </p>
<p><i>It's a word like &quot;postmodernism.&quot;</i> </p>
<p>To me at least, yes. I've said this occasionally in interviews and I get long letters 
back from people saying, You don't understand. Here's what dialecticalism is. </p>
<p><i>And it's incomprehensible again.</i> </p>
<p>Either it's incomprehensible or it's true, but totally obvious. People can be 
tone-deaf, too, they can't hear music. So like maybe I'm tone-deaf about this stuff 
or something. Everything I find in these fields either seems to be interesting but 
pretty obvious, once you see it, maybe you didn't see it, somebody has to point it 
out to you. But once you see it, it's of obvious. Or else the subject is just 
incomprehensible. In other fields it's quite different. If I pick up the latest issue 
of <i>Physics Review</i>, I'm not going to understand one word. But there's two differences. 
First of all, I know perfectly well what I would have to do to get to understand. And 
in some areas, I've even done it, although I'm not particularly good at it. But I can 
do it. The other thing is what you said before: I could ask you to tell me what this 
is about. I can go to some guy in the physics department and say, Tell me, why is 
everybody excited about this stuff? And they can tell it in a way which I can 
understand and adapt it to my level of understanding and also tell me how to go on, 
if I want to. In these other areas, say, dialectical materialism, or postmodern 
literary theory, there's just no way to do either of those two things, which leads me 
to only two conclusions. Either I'm missing a gene, like tone-deafness, which is 
conceivable, or it's a way of disguising maybe interesting ideas in an 
incomprehensible framework for reasons which ultimately turn out to be careerist. I 
don't want to criticize the people for being careerists. It's hard to live in this 
world, and you want to have self-respect. That's understandable and justifiable. And 
it turns out to be true that in most domains if there are hard things to understand, 
they're way beyond us. </p>
<p><i>Another trend in thinking or in how people approach society and try and understand it 
is the approach that's called &quot;conspiracy theory,&quot; which we've both encountered, of 
course. It has gained a great deal of popularity, particularly on the West Coast. I 
wonder not so much in the specific instance of, say, JFK or other conspiracies that 
are discussed, but more broadly in terms of, What's the right way, what's the most 
useful or effective way to try to understand what's going on in society and to 
prepare oneself to interact with it? Is there something about conspiracy theory as 
compared to, what? an approach emphasizing institutions and their implications? 
that's an obstacle, that represents a hindrance on understanding the world to change 
it?</i> </p>
<p>We want to find out the truth about the way things work. There are doubtless cases in 
which people get together, in fact, every example we find of planning decisions is a 
case where people got together and tried to figure something out and used their power 
or the power that they could draw from to try to achieve a result. If you like, 
that's a conspiracy. So with that definition everything that happens is a conspiracy. 
So if the Board of General Motors gets together and decides what kind of Chrysler, 
Ford, something, to produce next year, that's a conspiracy. Every business decision, 
every editorial decision ... </p>
<p><i>Ultimately made by people.</i> </p>
<p>If my department gets together and decides who to appoint next year, okay, it's a 
conspiracy. That's not interesting. Obviously, all decisions involve people. If the 
word conspiracy is to have any sensible meaning, the question becomes whether there 
are groupings well outside the structure of the major institutions that go around 
them, hijack them, undermine them, pursue other courses without an institutional 
base, and so on. </p>
<p><i>So that would be the notion of conspiracy theory. Things happen because these groups 
exist and do them, outside the normal structures of society.</i> </p>
<p>Because these groups or subgroups act outside of the structure of institutional 
power, they are special, and we call them conspiracies. But as I look over history, I 
don't find much of that. There are some cases, like a group of Nazi generals who at 
one point thought of assassinating Hitler. That's a conspiracy. But things like that 
are real blips on the screen, as far as I can see. </p>
<p><i>Supposing there's some number of them, what do you gain from spending a lot of time 
trying to unearth them and uncover them and understand them?</i> </p>
<p>If people want to study the group of generals who decided that it was time to get rid 
of Hitler, that's a fine topic for a monograph, or maybe somebody will write a thesis 
on it. But we're not going to learn anything about the world from it. That will show 
how the people acted in particular circumstances, etc. Fine. </p>
<p><i>You say we're not going to learn anything about the world from it. That's true almost 
by definition. The whole idea is that these people act in a sense outside the normal 
functioning of the world, so studying them teaches us about them, but not about 
typical and recurring patterns in history.</i> </p>
<p>They were acting outside because of unusual circumstances, exactly. And what's more, 
it's only a shade away from the Board of Directors of General Motors sitting down in 
their executive suite and making their regular decisions. It's just a little bit away 
from that because they happened to depart somewhat from the major power structures. 
But we're not learning much about how the world works, in fact, nothing that 
generalizes to the next case. It's going to be historically contingent and specific. 
If you look at modern American history, where these issues have flourished, I think 
such cases are notable by their absence. At least as I read the record, it almost 
never happens. Occasionally you'll find something, like, say, the Reaganites with 
their off-the-shelf subversive and terrorist activities. But that's kind of a fringe 
operation. Probably the reason it got smashed pretty quickly is because the 
institutions are too powerful to tolerate it. Take, say, the CIA, which is considered 
the source of lots of conspiracies. We have a ton of information about them, and as I 
read the information, they're pretty loyal bureaucrats and do what they're told. As 
far as the Pentagon goes, they'll push their interests, and the services will push 
their interests, but in pretty transparent ways. </p>
<p><i>So this is systemic, not conspiratorial. You have two arguments. One is, even if it 
exists, even if there are occasional or even frequent conspiracies, examining them is 
going to teach us about that event. Not much about history or the way things work. 
The next claim is, well, there aren't even that many in the first place.</i> </p>
<p>What they usually are is what you'd find in a big corporation, or in a faculty, or 
any other structure you're in. </p>
<p><i>You think it's generally a normal outgrowth of the operations of an institution.</i> </p>
<p>An institution has a certain structure of power. It has certain resources. It has an 
authority structure. It fits into the general society in certain ways, and if it 
tried to break out of those ways it would be undermined and destroyed. If General 
Motors decided to become a benevolent organization and produce good cars at the 
cheapest rates with the best working conditions, they'd be out of business tomorrow. 
Somebody who isn't doing it would undermine them. There are reasons why institutions 
operate the way they do within a bigger framework. Suppose, say, Clinton, in a dream, 
was really going to behave like the British Labor Party thinks he is, namely the 
revolutionary who is going to bring about a social revolution. In one minute, bond 
prices would start to decline slightly. The interest rate would go up. The economy 
would start to collapse, and that's the end of that program. There are frameworks 
within which things happen. </p>
<p><i>That's because he would be operating as a isolated individual with no power base, 
just because he wants to, perhaps with a few allies, a conspiracy running againts the 
grain, and getting nowhere.</i> </p>
<p>Exactly. And the people who have the power would say, I don't like that, so I'll pull 
my money out of Treasury securities and put it somewhere else. And it goes down and 
you've got a response. In fact, if he doesn't understand it, he could have read a 
front-page article in the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> a couple of weeks ago explaining it in 
simple words, just in case anybody got any ideas. But you don't have to say it. 
Everybody understands it. We have tremendous concentrations of power throughout the 
society in the economy and the political system and the ideological system. They're 
all very interlinked in all kinds of ways, but the degree of power and authority and 
domination is extraordinary. If any renegade group tried to break out of that, they 
would quickly be in trouble and cut off. You can see it happening, right at the top. 
Take, say, Nixon and Watergate. Watergate was just a triviality. In terms of the 
horrifying actions that the government carried out, Watergate isn't even worth 
laughing about. It's a tea party. It's kind of interesting to see what kind of issues 
were raised. </p>
<p><i>A teaparty except for one thing, which is that it was aimed at elites.</i> </p>
<p>It was aimed at elites. He broke out of the normal workings of power. He called 
Thomas Watson of IBM a bad name. He tried to undermine the Democratic Party, which is 
half the business power in the country. Sure, he was called on the carpet and tossed 
out in three seconds. Not because he had violated some moral code. Essentially he was 
not attacked for the atrocities that he carried out. The FBI killed Fred Hampton in 
his administration, a straight Gestapo-style killing. That never came up at 
Watergate. Take the bombing of Cambodia, one of the most dramatic things, this thing 
called the secret bombing of Cambodia, which was &quot;secret&quot; because the press didn't 
talk about what they knew. They killed probably a couple hundred thousand people. 
They devastated a peasant society. It came up, but only in one respect: Did he tell 
Congress about it? In other words, were people with power granted their prerogatives? 
That's the only issue that came up. You can see what happens when somebody even 
marginally breaks out of the system. They're quickly put back in their box, because 
they're servants. Real power lies elsewhere. </p>
<p><i>And even there, it's not individuals. General Motors is an institution and the people 
who run it don't have that much power either.</i> </p>
<p>The head of IBM just got tossed out. Why? They didn't have enough profit last year. 
You either do your job or you're out. Power lies elsewhere. When the American 
corporate system decided the Vietnam War wasn't worth it for them any more, they had 
gotten what they were going to get, they basically told Johnson to go back to Texas. 
He was fired. He was told, You're not going to run. Pull out. Now they have somebody 
else. Within a system that works like this, it would be pretty remarkable if there 
were anything remotely like what the various conspiracy theories conjure up. When you 
look at them, they just collapse, not surprisingly. </p>
<p><i>With perhaps one exception: King's assassination.</i> </p>
<p>It's interesting. That's the one case where we can imagine pretty good reasons why 
somebody would want to kill him. I would not be in the least surprised if there was a 
real conspiracy behind that one, and probably a high-level one. </p>
<p><i>Assuming it was Hoover, then, the mechanism is there, the means are there, everything 
is available. Nobody would be upset in the government.</i> </p>
<p>I don't think there's been a lot of inquiry into that one. If there has I'm not aware 
of it. But that's the one very plausible case. You're absolutely right. In the case 
of the one everybody's excited about, Kennedy, nobody has ever come up with a 
plausible reason. </p>
<p><i>It's an interesting question. Why do you think when you hear these people who believe 
in the efficacy of looking at conspiracy and trying to understand it, the amount of 
energy that goes into the Kennedy case almost can't even be measured, it's off the 
scale, but the amount of energy that goes into the King case is relatively small.</i> </p>
<p>It's a pretty dramatic contrast, because the case of the King one is prima facie very 
plausible. The case of the Kennedy one is prima facie extremely implausible. So it is 
a question that you want to ask. </p>
<p><i>Perhaps if you have a conspiracy approach to things, the more implausible it is, the 
more outside of the normal grain it is, the more of a conspiracy it is, the more 
attractive it is to you. I don't know.</i> </p>
<p>There are things in a way conspiring to make the Kennedy case an attractive topic. 
One is just the glitter of Camelot. The Kennedy administration was in many ways very 
similar to the Reagan administration in power. </p>
<p><i>The glitter of Camelot is specks of blood...</i> </p>
<p>But the point is that the Kennedy administration did one smart thing. They buttered 
up the intellectual class, as compared with the Reaganites, who just treated them 
with contempt. The result was they got a terrific image. They gave an appearance of 
sharing power that was never real to the kind of people who write books and articles 
and make movies and that sort of thing. The result is that Camelot had a beautiful 
image, lovely imagery, and there's been great efforts to maintain that image. Somehow 
they succeeded in getting a lot of people to believe it. You can go down to the 
South, to a poor, rural, black area and you'll find a picture of Kennedy. In fact, 
Kennedy's role in the civil rights movement was not pretty. But somehow the imagery 
succeeded, even if the reality wasn't there. And it's certainly true that a lot of 
things have gone wrong in the last twenty, twenty-five years. Plenty of things have 
gone wrong, for all sorts of totally independent reasons, which one can talk about. 
The civil rights movement made great achievements, but it never lived up to the hopes 
that many people had invested in it. The antiwar movement made achievements, but it 
didn't end war. Real wages have been declining for twenty years. A lot of things have 
been happening that aren't pretty. And it's easy to fall into the belief that we had 
a hero and we had a wonderful country and we had this guy who was going to lead us to 
a better future ... we had the Messiah and <i>they</i> shot him down and ever since then 
everything's been illegitimate. </p>

<P><H1>Michael Albert and Noam Chomsky</H1>
<H3>Part III</H3>

<P>From <A HREF="http://www.lbbs.org">ZNet</A>

<P><P><TABLE WIDTH=66%><TR><TD>
In January 1993 Michael Albert and Noam Chomsky recorded a series of conversations which were
later distributed by <i>Z Magazine</i>. Here we present a transcription of some material from the 1993 tapes, essentially verbatim, in three parts. Some of the topical material is now historical, of course, but the rest is as timely as when first discussed.
</TABLE>
</CENTER>

<p><i>I remember when I was organizing in the sixties and also since, thought it is harder to
elicit when less 
seems to be at stake, I would frequently encounter a view lying behind people's reticence to act
or to 
become part of political movements. The view was basically that human nature is corrupt,
egotistical, 
self-centered, anti-social and that as a result of that, society would always be haves and
have-nots, 
oppressors and oppressed, hierarchical and so on. I'd often find that in organizing you could get 
agreement on the inhumanity of a particular system or the illegality or injustice of, say, the war
or some 
set of policies, more recently, but that people would refrain from becoming active around it
because of a 
sense of hopelessness having to do with this view of human nature. It may have been just an
excuse, and 
it may be just a last line of defense against becoming active, but still, in order to deal with it
you have to 
address the claim. So I'm wondering ...</i> </p>
<p>There is a sense in which the claim is certainly true. There certainly is something ... human
nature, that we 
all have. First of all, it is something we don't know much about. Doubtless there is a rich and
complex human 
nature, and doubtless it's largely genetically determined, like everything else. But we don't know
what it is. 
However, there's enough evidence from history and experience to show that it is certainly at least
consistent 
with everything you mentioned. </p>
<p><i>Since we have had the phenomena, of course they can exist alongside human nature. </i></p>
<p>More than that. We know that human nature, and that includes our nature, yours and mine, can
easily turn 
people into quite efficient torturers and mass murderers and slave drivers and so on. We know
that. You 
don't have to look very far. But what does that mean? Should we therefore not try to stop torture?
If we see 
somebody beating a child to death, should we say, well, you know, that's human nature? Which it
is, in fact, 
an emergence of behavior based on the combination of human nature and certain pressures and 
circumstances. There are certainly conditions under which people will act like that. But to the
extent that the 
statement it true, and there is such an extent, it's just not relevant. Human nature also has the
capacity to lead 
to selflessness and cooperation and sacrifice and support and solidarity and lots of other things,
too. </p>
<p><i>Is there a sense in which one way of being is more consistent with human fulfillment and
development 
and another way of being is somehow contrary to it? Where do values come from?</i> </p>
<p>Where do values come from? That's an interesting question. Any answer that we give is based on
extremely 
little understanding, so nothing one says is very serious. But I don't see how it can fail to be
true, just from 
the conditions of moral judgment it seems to me that it must be true that moral values are
basically rooted in 
our nature. The reason I say that is pretty elementary. Undoubtedly, the way in which we look at
things and 
judge them and assess them and so on has a significant and notable cultural factor. But that
aside, we are 
certainly capable, and everyone does, of making moral judgments and and assessments and
evaluations in 
entirely new situations. We do it all the time. We're constantly coming up with new situations. We
may not 
consciously evaluate them, but we certainly are at least tacitly doing it. It's the basis for our
choice of action. 
So we're constantly making all kinds of judgments, including moral judgments and esthetic
judgments and all 
sorts of others about new things and new situations. Either it's being done just randomly, like
you pull 
something out of a hat, which certainly doesn't seem to be true, either introspectively or by
observation, or 
else we're doing it on the basis of some moral system that we have in our mind somehow which gives 
answers, or at least partial answers, to a whole range of new situations. Nobody knows what that
system is. 
We don't understand it at all. But it seems to be rich and complex enough that it applies to
indefinitely many 
new situations. How did it get there? </p>
<p><i>What characterizes a system like this?</i> </p>
<p>Maybe it's an axiomatic system. I'm sure this is false. You could imagine it's like the axioms
of number 
theory. It's a bunch of principles from which you can deduce consequences, saying this action is
preferable 
to that one. I'm not making that as a serious proposal, but that would be what such a system could
look like. 
Or it could be like language. </p>
<p><i>Could you make a serious proposal?</i> </p>
<p>A serious proposal I suspect is more like what we know about language. A lot is known: that
there are basic 
fundamental principles that are invariant, sort of fixed in our nature. They hold for all
languages. They 
provide the framework for language. They allow a certain limited degree of modification, and that 
modification comes from early experience. When the options of variation are fixed, you have a
whole system 
functioning which allows us to do exactly what you and I are doing, namely to say new things, to
understand 
new things, to interpret new expressions nobody has ever heard. Qualitatively speaking, that's
what the 
system of moral judgment looks like. So it's conceivable that it has a similar kind of basis. But
we have to 
find the answer. You can't just guess. You could say the same about ... </p>
<p><i>It can't be simple. It can't be &quot;Thou shalt not kill,&quot; obviously.</i> </p>
<p>No. Because that's not what we decide. We decide much more complex things. So what are they? We
have 
good reason to believe that they're there because we can in fact make relatively consistent
judgments, 
understood and appreciated by others, sometimes with disagreement, in which case you can have
moral 
discourse. And it's under new conditions and facing new problems, and so on. Unless we're angels,
it got 
into the organism the same way other complex things did, namely, largely by a genetically
determined 
framework which gets marginally modified through the course of probably early experience. That's a
moral 
system. How much variation can there be in such moral systems? Without understanding, we don't
know. 
How much variation can there be in languages? Without understanding we don't know. </p>
<p><i>By variation, you mean from individual to individual?</i> </p>
<p>Or from culture to culture, and so on. We can make a fair guess that it's not much variation.
The reason for 
that is quite elementary. The system appears to be complex and determinate, and there are only two
factors 
that can enter into determining it. One is our fixed internal nature, and the other is experience.
And we know 
that experience is very impoverished. It doesn't give a lot of direction. Suppose somebody asks,
Why do 
children undergo puberty at a certain age? Actually, nobody knows the answer to that, so we're
talking about 
a topic that's unknown. But there are only two factors that can enter into it. One is something in
pre-puberty 
experience that sets you to undergo puberty, some effect of the environment, say, peer pressure,
or somebody 
told you it would be a good idea, or something like that. The other is, you're just designed so
that under 
certain conditions and at a certain level of maturation, hormones, this and that, you undergo
puberty. 
Everybody assumes the second, without knowing anything. If somebody came along and said they think
that 
it's peer pressure that causes puberty because you see other people doing it and you want to be
like them, 
without knowing anything you just laugh. The reason you laugh is very simple. The environment is
not 
specific enough and rich enough to determine this highly specific change that takes place. That
logic holds 
for just about everything in growth and development. That's why people assume without knowledge
that an 
embryo will become a chicken or a human depending on its nature, not depending on the nutrition
that's fed 
in, though its needs the nutrition. The nutrition doesn't have enough information to cause those
highly specific 
changes. And it looks as if things like moral judgment are of that character. </p>
<p><i>As are, you would say, rules of language, perhaps even concepts?</i> </p>
<p>Yeah. For rules of language and for concepts, there's a fair amount of understanding of the
matter, especially 
rules of language. In fact, that's the area of human intelligence where there's most
understanding. But almost 
everything has more or less the same logic. As I said, it's not different from the logic of
embryological 
development. In fact, it's kind of similar to that. I think a reasonable judgment at this point
would be that 
things like moral evaluation are similar. Actually contributing to this is the fact that you can
have moral 
discourse. Take an issue on which people are really split. Take, say, slavery. If you look at the
debate over 
slavery, to a certain extent it wasn't just an intellectual debate, obviously. It was a struggle.
But insofar as it 
was an intellectual debate, and it was, partially, there was a certain shared moral ground to it.
And in fact 
the slave owner's arguments are not so simple to answer. In fact some of them are valid and have a
lot of 
implications, and they were taken seriously by American workers in the late nineteenth century.
</p>
<p><i>You take better care of the slave if you own it than ...</i> </p>
<p>Exactly. You take better care of your car if you own it than if you rent it, so you take better
care of your 
worker if you own it than if you rent it. So slavery is benevolent. And the free market is morally
atrocious. 
Workers who organized into the Knights of Labor and other working-class organizations in the late 
nineteenth century, you look back at the literature and you see a strain running through that
says, look, we 
fought to end slavery, not to impose it. </p>
<p><i>So somehow there are these moral principles or something that you understand that you have
to appeal 
to even if what you're doing is rather venal.</i> </p>
<p>In fact, I think it's extremely rare for even an SS guard or a torturer or whatever to say, I'm
doing this 
because I like to be a son of a bitch. Everybody does bad things in their lives, and if you think
back, it's rare 
that you have said, I'm doing it because I feel like it. </p>
<p><i>You reinterpret the components of it so ...</i> </p>
<p>So it fits the moral values that you share with other people. I don't want to suggest that
moral values are 
uniform; if you look across cultures you do find some differences. But when you look at different
languages 
you also appear to find in fact radical differences. You know they can't be there. Because if the
differences 
were really great, it would have been impossible to acquire any of the languages. So therefore
they've got to 
be superficial, and the scientific question is, prove what must be true by the logic of the
situation. I think the 
same things must be the case for moral judgment, too. Going back to your original point, we can't
reasonably 
doubt that moral values are rooted in our nature, I don't think. </p>
<p><i>But if that's true, I've always had to think about it in such a way that for me the image of
a human being 
is a creature with certain kinds of needs and desires and potentials and capabilities and that the 
fulfillment of those is social, that the fulfillment of those doesn't entail that one crush
another, that one 
be on top of another, that one gain at another's loss and so on. If that's true, and if people
have this 
shared set of values, then you have to explain why everything is as corrupt and hierarchical and 
war-laden as it is.</i> </p>
<p>First of all, why not ask another question: how come there is so much sympathy and care and
love and 
solidarity? That's also true. </p>
<p><i>That's the reverse. That's the way I answer it all the time.</i> </p>
<p>There's no such thing as, Why is there so much of this and so much of that? There is what there
is. What there 
is is doubtless conditioned by the opportunities and choices that are imposed and available in a
particular 
social, cultural, and even physical setting. </p>
<p><i>Someone might say, just to clarify what all this means, to truck and barter is human.</i>
</p>
<p>Someone can say it, but there's no reason to believe it. </p>
<p><i>Why isn't there any reason to believe it? The person's argument is, Look around. Trucking
and bartering 
everywhere.</i> </p>
<p>And you look at peasant societies and they lived for thousands of years without it. Take a look
inside a 
family. Do people truck and barter over how much they're going to eat for dinner? Certainly a
family is a 
normal social structure. You can't exist without it. And you don't have trucking and bartering in
it. If you look 
back at the history of trucking and bartering, say, look at the history of modern capitalism, here
we know a 
lot about it. First of all, peasants had to be driven by force and violence into a labor system.
They didn't 
want it. Then there were major conscious efforts made to create wants. There's a whole interesting
literature 
about want creation. It happened over a long stretch in the evolution of capitalism, but you see
it 
encapsulated briefly when slavery was terminated. It's dramatic to look at those cases. </p>
<p><i>You see it all the time on TV.</i> </p>
<p>Creating wants, yes. But I'm talking about conscious discussion of the need to do it. In the
early 1830s there 
was a big slave revolt in Jamaica, which was one of the things that led the British to decide to
give up 
slavery, that is, it was not paying any more. Within a couple of years they had to go from a slave
economy to 
a so-called &quot;free&quot; economy. But they wanted it to remain exactly the same. They
understood this. You take a 
look at the parliamentary debates. They're very conscious that they've got to keep it the way it
is. The 
masters become the owners. The slaves become the happy workers. We've got to somehow work it out.
</p>
<p><i>Distribution of wealth and power, keep it. Slave relation, dump it.</i> </p>
<p>Yes, they wanted everything to remain the same except not formal slavery, and the problem is,
how do you 
do it? There's a lot of open land in Jamaica. If you let the slaves go free, they're just going to
go out on the 
land and settle and be perfectly happy and they're not going to work for the sugar plantations.
How are we 
going to force them to work on the plantation? Two things were decided. This was the period when 
everybody was talking about how marvelous free trade is, the government's not allowed to intervene
and you 
can't help people in the Irish famine a decade away and that sort of thing. But in Jamaica it was
a little 
different. There they said, we'll use government state force to close off the lands so people
can't go to the 
land. And since all these workers don't really want a lot of things, they're just going to satisfy
their needs, 
which they can easily do in this tropical climate, we have to create wants. We have to create a
set of wants 
so that they desire things which they now don't desire. And the only way they'll be able to
achieve those 
desires is by working as wage labor in order to get them. There was conscious discussion and in
fact 
extensive efforts made to do exactly what you see on TV: create wants so that people would be
driven into a 
wage labor society which they don't want themselves. That pattern is done over and over again
through the 
history of capitalism. In fact, what the history of capitalism shows is that throughout people had
to be driven 
into situations which are now claimed to be their nature. If the history shows anything, it's that
that's not their 
nature. </p>
<p><i>But of course if you erase the history, erase the evidence, and look only at a snapshot of
the present, it's 
a consistent hypothesis that maybe it is natural. It becomes a compelling legitimation.</i> </p>
<p>Sure. But again, by that argument, you could justify slavery. Take a snapshot of a slave
society, and probably 
under most circumstances most of the slaves not only accept it but want it to stay that way.
That's the only 
way they can survive. They look to the master to protect them. They don't want to give that up.
Same about 
feudal societies. Same about absolutism. Probably the same about prisons, if you bother to look.
</p>
<p><i>So what is it about the society we live under that is at the core of what's wrong? What's
got to go?</i> </p>
<p>In my opinion, <i>every</i> form of authority and domination and hierarchy, every authoritarian
structure has to 
justify itself. It has no prior justification. It has to prove that it's justified. </p>
<p><i>What kind of authoritarian structure?</i> </p>
<p>Anything. </p>
<p><i>Something where one person has more power than another.</i> </p>
<p>Yeah. Like you stop your three-year-old kid when he's trying to cross the street. That's an
authoritarian 
situation. It's got to be justified. Okay, I think in that case you can give a justification for
it. The burden of 
proof is on the person exercising the authority, invariably. Most of the time, when you look,
these structures 
have no justification. They have no moral justification. They have no justification in the
interests of the 
person lower in the hierarchy, or other people, or the environment, or the future, or the society,
or anything 
else. They're there in order to preserve certain structures of power and domination that benefit
those at the 
top. And every time you find that, it's illegitimate and it should change. And we find it
everywhere. We find 
it in all kinds of human relations, crucially in economic relations, which are at the core of how
any society 
functions. What's produced, what's consumed, what's distributed, what decision was made. These
things help 
set a framework within which everything else happens. And they're completely hierarchic and
authoritarian. </p>
<p><i>It's also true that how people live their lives in their homes, how people regard one
another, sets a 
framework in which even work is affected. All these things mutually interact with each other and
affect 
one another.</i> </p>
<p>And in every one of them that you look at, there are questions about authority and domination
that ought to be 
raised constantly, and that very rarely have satisfactory answers. Sometimes they do, I think, but
it has to be 
shown. As a matter of fact, you can even ask the same about your relation to animals. The
questions can be 
asked there, too, in fact are being asked. </p>
<p><i>You're an animal rights activist?</i> </p>
<p>I think it's a serious question. To what extent do we have a right to torture animals? I think
it's a very good 
thing that that question ... </p>
<p><i>Torture?</i> </p>
<p>Experiments are torturing animals, let's say. That's what they are. So to what extent do we
have a right to 
torture animals for our own good? I think that's not a trivial question. </p>
<p><i>What about eating?</i> </p>
<p>Same question. </p>
<p><i>Are you a vegetarian?</i> </p>
<p>I'm not, but I think it's a serious question. If you want my guess, my guess would be that ...
</p>
<p><i>A hundred years from now everyone will be.</i> </p>
<p>I don't know if it's a hundred years, but it seems to me if history continues--that's not at
all obvious, that it 
will--but if society continues to develop without catastrophe on something like the course that
you can sort of 
see over time, I wouldn't be in the least surprised if it moves toward vegetarianism and
protection of animal 
rights. In fact, what we've seen over the years--and it's hard to be optimistic in the twentieth
century, which 
is one of the worst centuries in human history in terms of atrocities and terror and so on--but
still, over the 
years, including the twentieth century, there is a widening of the moral realm, bringing in
broader and 
broader domains of individuals who are regarded as moral agents. </p>
<p><i>Nothing could be happening to that underlying, wired-in, inate, intrinsic character... That
can't be 
changing.</i> </p>
<p>No, but it can get more and more realized. You can get a better and better understanding of it.
We're 
self-conscious beings. We're not rocks. And we can get more and more understanding of our own
nature, not 
because we read a book about it. The book doesn't have anything to tell you, because nobody knows 
anything. But just through experience, including historical experience, which is part of our own
personal 
experience because it's embedded in our culture, which we enter into. </p>
<p><i>So then it's plausible that vegetarians, animal rights advocates and the like are just a
couple of steps 
ahead in discerning something about ...</i> </p>
<p>It's possible. I think I'd certainly keep an open mind on that. You can understand how it could
be true. It's 
certainly a pretty intelligible idea to us. I think one can see the moral force to it. You don't
have to go back 
very far to find gratuitous torture of animals. In Cartesian philosophy, for example, where it was
assumed ... 
the Cartesians thought they had proven that humans had minds and everything else in the world was
a 
machine. So there's no difference between a cat and a watch, let's say. It's just the cat's a
little more 
complicated. You go back to the court in the seventeenth century, and big smart guys who studied
all that 
stuff and thought they understood it would as a sport take Lady So-and-So's favorite dog and kick
it and beat 
it to death and so on and laugh, saying, this silly lady doesn't understand the latest philosophy,
which was 
that it was just like dropping a rock on the floor. That's gratuitous torture of animals. It was
regarded as if 
we would ask a question about the torturing of a rock. You can't do it. There's no way to torture
a rock. The 
moral sphere has certainly changed in that respect. Gratuitous torture of animals is no longer
considered 
quite legitimate. </p>
<p><i>Maybe what's changing is the understanding of what an animal is, rather than some of the
underlying 
moral values.</i> </p>
<p>In that case it probably was, because in fact the Cartesian view was a departure from the
traditional view, in 
which you didn't torture animals gratuitously. On the other hand, there are cultures like, say,
fox hunting, 
aristocratic cultures that have fox hunting as a sport, or say, bear baiting, or things like that,
in which there 
actually was gratuitous torture of animals. In fact, it's kind of intriguing to see how we regard
this. Take cock 
fighting, in which cocks are trained to tear each other to shreds. Our culture happens to regard
that as 
barbaric. On the other hand, we train humans to tear each other to shreds. It's called boxing
matches. And 
that's not regarded as barbaric. So there are things we don't permit of cocks that we permit of
poor people. 
There are some funny values at work there. </p>
<p><i>It's peculiar. But of course we don't pay the birds, whereas we pay the boxers handsomely.
We assume 
that they suffer.</i> </p>
<p>But everybody knows that you don't find people going into professional boxing from wealthy
families. That 
tells you something right away. </p>
<p><i>So if authority relations are the things that are suspect, the things that have to be
undone, what are the 
institutions that basically embody that? Presumably private ownership.</i> </p>
<p>Private ownership's an obvious one. Patriarchic relations are another. Relations of race
discrimination and 
oppression are others. </p>
<p><i>How about the market?</i> </p>
<p>The market itself, just by its very logic, induces oppressive relations very quickly, simply
because of the 
inequities it produces. </p>
<p><i>That's where the justice or equity in some sense is the thing that's abrogated by authority,
the thing that 
you want to justify.</i> </p>
<p>I think authority and justice are incompatible, except in very rare instances, namely, if the
authority can be 
justified. And maybe sometimes it can. Like the case of caring for children. I think there it can
be justified. 
Or suppose we had a catastrophe, let's say. Suppose a hurricane swept over this place and a couple
of 
people who for some reason happened to have their heads screwed on sort of took control and told
us, do 
this, do that, do the other thing. I'd follow them. I wouldn't know what to do. If they seemed to
understand 
what has to be done, had presence of mind, some understanding of the situation, I think I would
willingly 
grant them the authority to make decisions that I don't feel competent to make, and I'd rather
have them make 
them. So I grant them the authority to do it. That's a situation of authority. But we agree to it.
</p>
<p><i>Suppose somebody comes along and says that most working people in fact are granting the
authority of 
their employers and bosses on the grounds that they don't have the expertise, the knowledge, the
skills, 
etc., and they also don't want the burden and the responsibility?</i> </p>
<p>I would ask the same question that we would ask of prisoners. Suppose somebody said the
prisoners are 
voluntarily granting the authority to the guards. I'd believe that when it's proven. The burden of
proof, again, 
is always on the person who claims that the authority is justified. I think that's a fundamental
moral principle. </p>
<p><i>Sure, but if you want to make a counterargument...</i> </p>
<p>It may not be that simple. In fact, it's not that simple. Let's make it realistic. The way
things are now, and this 
has been true throughout modern history, people have chosen to go to jail because they can
survive. If you're 
starving to death on the outside, freezing to death, there are many cases, and there are cases
right now where 
they go out and break a window and say, hey, put me in jail. It looks like he's choosing to be
kicked around 
by the warden. </p>
<p><i>Because it's better than another horrible situation.</i> </p>
<p>It's true in a sense. </p>
<p><i>It's also true that people choose to work for employers who will exploit them because
there's no other 
option.</i> </p>
<p>You have to look at the range of options that are not only objectively available to them, but
that are 
subjectively available. How are they allowed to think? How are they able to think? There are all
kinds of 
ways of thinking that are kind of cut off from us, not because we're incapable of them, but there
are various 
blockages that have been developed and imposed that keep us from thinking about them. Actually,
that's what 
indoctrination is about. And I don't mean somebody giving you lectures. Sitcoms on television,
sports that 
you watch. Every aspect of the culture involves some form of expression of what a proper life or a
proper 
set of values are, implicitly. That's all indoctrination, and that cuts off opportunities. And
often just straight 
violence. If people cannot find what their own values are except through interaction, what's
called political 
theory, there's not much theory to it, it's truisms, but one of the traditional ideas of political
theory for 
hundreds of years has been that in order to maintain absolute control--what we nowadays call
totalitarian 
societies--what you have to do is isolate people. People have to be isolated in order to be
controlled. And 
once they're isolated they're easily controlled because they don't even know what they think.
You're sitting 
alone in a room and you don't even know what you think. Again, in science, it's a commonplace. You
work 
together. There's no other way to work. In order to have ideas or understanding, you have to sort
of bounce 
them off other people and see what their reactions are and learn from them. That's the way you
even find out 
what your values are, or your interests, or anything else. Keep people isolated and they don't
have subjective 
options, even if they have objective ones. And unless those options are opened up, both
subjectively and in 
fact concretely, namely you can do something about it without suicide or suffering, then to claim
that people 
choose their oppression is completely meaningless. They choose it under conditions where there
isn't a 
choice. </p>
<p><i>Suppose somebody said that that kind of observation is taken from on high. Who are you to
decide that 
what somebody else is choosing has been constrained? Who are you decide? Once you start doing that
...</i> </p>
<p>It's for them to decide. I agree. I think it's for the people to decide. But the point is the
people should be 
given every opportunity to make a considered choice, meaning an opportunity to think through the
options 
and so on. For example, I've just been reading a novel by an Egyptian novelist who won the Nobel
Prize a 
couple of years ago about life in Cairo, I think it was in the 1920s. The central story is a woman
who lives 
under the iron rule of her husband. She's a total slave. In a big tragedy, she gets kicked out for
this or that 
infringement. Her life is destroyed because she loved being a slave. She was able to take care of
the house, 
and she had her domain in which she was not out of the house, but that's ok, because the husband
is the god, 
that sort of thing. You can imagine the rest. Did she choose that? I don't know if it's an
accurate depiction of 
some society. But it could be. In fact, I'm sure it is of some societies. Did she choose it? In a
sense, yes. Is it 
therefore her nature? In order to know the answer to that question, you have to put that same
person in other 
circumstances. </p>
<p><i>People have a remarkable talent for making the best of whatever situation they're in, and
that's obviously 
a tremendously advantageous quality. But it's also a quality that leaves you trapped in
circumstances 
that are far less desirable than you might otherwise attain.</i> </p>
<p>That's the point of isolation--cut people off from thinking through and perceiving the
opportunities that are 
available to them. Leave them only making do with things as they are. </p>
<p><i>So suppose we eliminate these obstacles to human beings being free and liberated and
fulfilling 
themselves. What does that mean? What kind of a society is that? Clearly, there's been one label
given to 
this--socialism--over the years.But nowadays people claim this failed, that something went
wrong.</i> </p>
<p>First of all, I don't know that anything went wrong. We may not be ready for it. But there was
a period in 
history when we weren't ready for ending slavery, either. There was a period in human history when 
conditions, including subjective conditions, were such that ending slavery wasn't in the cards.
You could 
argue--I don't agree with it--one could argue that conditions are such that we need the degree of
hierarchy 
and domination that exists in totalitarian institutions like capitalist enterprises in order to
satisfy our needs, 
at least so far in history. </p>
<p><i>With central planning or dictatorship ...</i> </p>
<p>It could be argued. I don't believe a word of it. But the point is somebody would have to argue
it. If you look 
at what actually happened, the concentration of force and violence was such as to guarantee
certain 
outcomes. Those outcomes destroyed incipient efforts at cooperative worker control, say. There
have been 
efforts in that direction for hundreds of years. They regularly get crushed. And they get crushed
by force. The 
Bolsheviks are a perfectly good example. In the stages leading up to the Bolshevik revolution, up
to October 
1917, there were incipient socialist institutions being developed--workers' councils, things like
that. They 
survived to an extent, but not very long. They were pretty much eliminated. You can argue about
the 
justification, but the fact is that they were pretty quickly eliminated. Some people want to
justify it. The 
standard justification is, Lenin and Trotsky had to do it because of the contingencies of the
civil war and 
survival and this and that. </p>
<p><i>There wouldn't have been food otherwise, says the apologis.</i> </p>
<p>Right. That's the only kind of justification that immoral acts can possibly get. That's the
only kind of 
justification that authority can ever get. Look, we needed it. It's like my hurricane example.
Under dire 
conditions you accept authority. </p>
<p><i>Actually, it's exactly analogous to the hurricane example.</i> </p>
<p>Exactly analogous. The question is, Is it true? There you've got to look at the historical
facts. I don't think it's 
true. In fact, I think these structures were dismantled before the ... </p>
<p><i>Yes, they were. But does a Lenin or a Trotsky sincerely feel that they're like the couple of
people who are 
running through the streets helping in the hurricane, or are they just aggrandizing their own
wealth and 
power and status? Or it is the same thing?</i> </p>
<p>I think it's the same thing. We don't want to be cavalier about it. It's a question of
historical fact and what the 
people really were like and what they were thinking, and you've got to find out what the answer
is. But my 
feeling is, reading their own writings, that they knew what they were doing and it was
understandable and 
they even had a theory behind it. It was both a moral theory and a socio-economic theory. First of
all, as 
good orthodox Marxists, they didn't really believe that a socialist revolution was possible in
Russia, which 
was just a peasant backwater. So they were carrying out a kind of holding action, waiting for the
iron laws 
of history to grind out the revolution in Germany, where it's supposed to come. You know the story
better 
than I do. That's what's supposed to happen by historical necessity, so they're going to hold on
until it 
happens, and then Russia will be backwarder than it ought to be. Well, it didn't happen in
Germany. They 
also thought that in this pre-capitalist society, Russia being a deeply impoverished Third World
society, 
basically pre-capitalist, except for little pockets here and there, it was just necessary to beat
the people into 
development. They had to be turned into what Trotsky called the &quot;labor army&quot; in order to
carry out forced 
development, which would somehow carry them over the early stages of capitalism and
industrialization to 
the point where then the iron laws of history would start to work because the master said they
were going to. 
So there was a theory behind it, and a moral principle. It's going to be better for them in a
while. </p>
<p><i>So these could be understandable and even honest mistakes, or they could be natural
outgrowths of a 
worldview which says there are relatively few people who are exceptionally smart and should run
the 
show.</i> </p>
<p>That was Bakunin's prediction, about half a century before, that this was exactly what was
going to happen. 
He was talking about the Marxists at that time. That was before Lenin was born. His prediction
was, the 
nature of the intelligentsia as a formation in modern industrial society is that they can become
managers. 
They're not going to become managers because they own capital. They're not going to become
managers 
because they've got a lot of guns. They're going to become managers because they can control and
organize 
and direct what's called knowledge and so on. </p>
<p><i>Information and skills and access to decision-making.</i> </p>
<p>And he says they're going to become a Red bureaucracy, because that's in their interests. He
didn't say that's 
the nature of people. I don't know how much he thought it through. But reading back, we shouldn't
say they 
are going to do it because that's the nature of people. It's that the ones who don't do it will be
cast by the 
wayside. The ones who do do it will make out. The ones who are worthless and brutal and harsh
enough to 
do it, they're the ones who are going to survive in this kind of system. The ones who try to
associate 
themselves with popular organizations and to help the people themselves become organized and to
serve the 
people and that kind of thing are just not going to survive in these situations of power. </p>
<p><i>Supposing you have a relative advantage on information and knowledge. How do you explain
that to 
yourself? It's not too dissimilar from having a great amount of wealth, material wealth. You
either have 
that material wealth or knowledge by virtue of somehow being better or by virtue of somehow
unjustly 
having more than you deserve. It's a lot easier to assume that it's because you're better.</i>
</p>
<p>Why is it &quot;better&quot;? </p>
<p><i>You're in the lead.</i> </p>
<p>But all kinds of people are better at all kinds of things. There are things that I think I'm
better at than the guy 
across the street. There are things that the guy across the street's better at than I am. Who's
better? </p>
<p><i>You have a healthy view of the situation. There's an unhealthy view of the situation which
says, The 
reason why I have three cars and a huge house, etc., is because I am a different kind of human
being. I 
am superior. It's like racism, except it doesn't have skin color as its ...</i> </p>
<p>Everyone has some particular distribution of traits. You're better at some things and worse at
others. This 
guy is a good violinist. This guy can't hear straight. This guy can fix mechanical things and
understand them. 
The other one can't. If it wasn't true, I'd want to commit suicide. Living in a society of clones
would be 
worse than death. If everybody was alike it's not like living at all. You should enjoy and
appreciate the 
variety. The fact that other people can do things that I can't do is a source of appreciation. I
don't feel bad if I 
can't play the violin like somebody else. If I can't solve physics problems like somebody else,
fine. It makes 
me happy. You do what you do. Getting back to your point, the particular distribution of traits
that I have, 
partly just by nature, partly by the advantages that I've had through life, which were plenty, in
the case of the 
guy with three cars, there's a particular collection of traits plus luck. And the traits might be
viciousness, 
aggressiveness, willingness to undercut others, and so on, whatever that collection of traits is,
they're the 
ones that are valued and supported in particular social arrangements. So the Mafia don has traits
which are 
rewarded under particular social situations. Hitler had traits which were rewarded under those
social 
situations. That part's true, in that sense. It doesn't mean that they're better. It means that
they're better adapted 
to getting ahead under particular conditions. </p>
<p><i>The person in that position can have your understanding of the situation or can have an
understanding of 
the situation that it's just basically theft or can understand the situation as a proper reward
for 
somebody who is a superior being.</i> </p>
<p>Usually people will pick the last one. </p>
<p><i>Right. That's my point. But once you pick the last one, if you're Lenin or Trotsky or
whoever, then the 
understanding of society that you come up with tends to reflect that. So you come up with yourself
as a 
central actor, even a savior. You think there's a hurricane coming and I have to save everybody
from it, 
when in fact there is no hurricane coming, or, in any event, the only solution is for people to be
saving 
themselves, not having their means to do so taken away by you. There was the possibility of real 
democracy and real participation instead. But you see a hurricane because the role of savior is
the one 
you want to fill.</i> </p>
<p>And that's where I come back to what I said before. The burden of proof is always on the person
who claims 
the right of authority. So if you see a hurricane coming, prove it. If you can convince me that
there's a 
hurricane coming, and that you're the person who ought to direct people, okay, maybe so. But
you've got to 
prove it. I don't have to disprove it. I don't have to disprove anything. I can just say, You
haven't proven it. 
Period. And then I win. </p>
<p><i>And beating you over the head till you agree or holding all the cards and allowing no one to
play unless 
they agree, is of course not proving it, it is coercing it...</i> </p>
<p>Yes, and so that's the sense in which the burden of proof is on those who claim the legitimacy
of authority. 
And that's true whether it's a factory, a family or any other social arrangement. I think that
that burden can 
very rarely be met. It seems to me that part of real education, if we ever allowed such a thing,
would be to 
make sure people understand very early on that that's where the burden of proof is. I think you
don't have to 
try to teach it to people, however. I think they know it. You have to keep it from being driven
out of their 
heads. And it is driven out of their heads. It's driven out of their heads very early on just by
the structure of 
the educational system. </p>
<p>Kids who are too independent quickly get into trouble and are kept in line. Again, we don't
want to be glib 
about it. Again, the burden of proof is always on whoever it is that claims that the child has to
be controlled. 
Maybe the child is being independent and should be encouraged. It's just personal experience. As a
kid I 
happened to be lucky enough to be until I was about twelve in an experimental school run on
Deweyite lines 
by Temple University which happened to be a very free and open and independent place where they 
encouraged independence and creativity and so on. It was very constructive. It was a shock to me
when I got 
into City Academic High School for upward-striving kids who were going to go off to big colleges
and 
discovered what authority really is like in educational structures. I never had that before. And
it certainly 
requires justification, and I doubt that justification can be given in a great many cases. A lot
of even the 
stupidity of education has a social function, namely, preventing independence. You're given some
stupid 
assignment in eighth grade, and you'd better obey. </p>
<p><i>I've noticed that the public school system teaches not just obedience but also endurance of
boredom, the 
ability to sit and watch the clock and not run out of the room, which of course is exactly the
skill that one 
has to have to work in a capitalist firm.</i> </p>
<p>Punctuality. My oldest friend, who happened to emigrate from Eastern Europe when he was fifteen
or so, 
once told me that he went to a school in New York for bright kids. One of the things that struck
him right off 
in comparison with his earlier education was that if you got a C on an exam, nobody paid any
attention. But 
if you came two minutes late, you had to go to the principal's office--meaning you're being
trained for 
docility, obedience, punctuality for an assembly line job. </p>
<p><i>I remember even at MIT I was always astounded by the extent to which the education was
faculty coming 
in and writing textbooks on the wall and never once talking about the creative aspect of what they
do, or 
never literally doing it with you, but rather just reproducing stuff that you could go off and
read in any 
event.</i> </p>
<p>It surprises me when you say that. </p>
<p><i>As a undergraduate.</i> </p>
<p>In graduate school it's just not like that at all. In fact, graduate school is kind of like an
apprenticeship. 
You're working together. </p>
<p><i>Clearly that's the mode of education that makes some sense. The words are horrible:
&quot;master&quot; and 
&quot;apprentice,&quot; but the reality is interesting...</i> </p>
<p>It's because you're learning a craft. Apprenticeship doesn't mean necessarily following orders.
You can 
contribute and have your own ideas and learn at the same time. Doing science properly just isn't
something 
you can teach. No one knows how to teach it. You just kind of get the idea somehow. It's like
learning how to 
ride a bike or build a table. The way you get the idea is by working with people who somehow got
the idea. 
You get something from them, and in science certainly you contribute to them. Everybody knows in
the 
sciences that an awful lot of good ideas are coming from young people. That's just standard. </p>
<p><i>All your ideas come from students.</i> </p>
<p>It's just not even a question. You just take it for granted. </p>
<p><i>So you get the ideas from the students. Supposing we had a society with no authority,
where's the drive? 
Where's the momentum? Where's the pressure to advance and grow? These are questions this
discussion 
probably raises for some people.</i> </p>
<p>First of all, the &quot;pressure to advance,&quot; you have to ask exactly what that means. If
you mean the pressure to 
produce more, who wants it? Is that necessarily the right thing to do? That's not obvious. In many
areas it's 
probably the wrong thing to do. </p>
<p><i>Therefore the criticism that having this degree of freedom will remove that type of pressure
isn't 
criticism at all. It's a compliment.</i> </p>
<p>Let's go back to the period when people had to be driven. It's still today. People have to be
driven to have 
certain wants. Why? Why not leave them alone so they can just be happy and do other things? The
only drive 
there is, ought to be internal. Take a look at kids. They're creative. They explore. They want to
find out 
everything, try out new things. Why does a kid walk? </p>
<p><i>They have plenty of energy, curiosity, desire, but they don't want to work themselves to
death.</i> </p>
<p>Why does a kid walk? Say you've got a kid who's a year old. He's crawling fine. He can get
anywhere across 
the room he likes really fast, so fast his parents run after him to keep him from knocking
everything down. 
All of a sudden he gets up and starts walking. He's terrible at walking. He walks one step and
falls on his 
face. If he wants to really get somewhere he's going to crawl. So why does the kid start walking?
To do new 
things. That's the way we're built. We're built to want to do new things, even if they're not
efficient, even if 
they're harmful, even if you get hurt. I don't think that ever stops. You want to explore. You
want to press 
your capacities to the limits. You want to appreciate what you can do. The joy of creation is
something very 
few people have circumstances to experience much. Artists have it. Craftspeople have it.
Scientists have it. 
Most people don't have the opportunity often, in our society. But if you've been lucky enough to
have that 
opportunity, you know it's quite an experience. It doesn't have to be discovering Einstein's
theory of 
relativity. </p>
<p><i>Your way of expressing it is so different from ... I remember--we won't use names--a
physicist at MIT who 
gave a big talk and described the pleasure and the joy of creativity and wished that so many
people, 99% 
of the population, who don't have the capacity to experience that and to enjoy that, could have
that 
capacity. But since they don't I'll at least try to convey to them the pleasure that I get out of
having a new 
idea.</i> </p>
<p>I think that the physicist didn't want to think. Whoever it was knows perfectly well that
anyone can have that 
pleasure and that whoever it was had that pleasure many times in his life just by seeing what
other people 
have done. </p>
<p><i>You can also have it at many different levels of ...</i> </p>
<p>When you read a proof and finally figure out what it's about, it's exciting. </p>
<p><i>And it could be Pythagorean's theorem ... tenth grade as well as quantum mechanics, or
whatever ...</i> </p>
<p>That's exciting. My God, I never understood that before! That's creativity, even if somebody
proved it 2,000 
years ago. Every physicist has gone through that plenty of times. You keep being struck by the
marvels of 
what you're discovering, and you're discovering it, even though somebody else did it already. And
if you can 
add little bits to that here and there, that's exciting. I don't have any reason to believe what
that physicist said 
... And I think the same is true of a person who builds a boat. I don't see what's fundamentally
any different. </p>
<p><i>It doesn't seem to be any different at all as far as creativity and pleasure of
accomplishment, etc., unless 
of course an onus is put on it.</i> </p>
<p>I wish I could do that. I can't. I can't imagine doing it. </p>
<p><i>But there's one sense in which it's different. That is there's a social difference between
those kinds of acts 
that can accrue power and the kinds that won't. The skills of building a boat are different than
the skills 
of, say, conducting a meeting. Or for that matter being compelling verbally is very different
than, say, 
running quickly, at least in most societies.</i> </p>
<p>But the skills to which rewards and power accrue are violence ... </p>
<p><i>I don't mean necessarily in a bad society, I mean even in a good society. In a good society
the person who 
can make an argument and express herself well is going to be more influential if that isn't
equalized 
somehow. It's relatively equalized. The person who runs fast but has no verbal abilities
whatsoever, 
how's the person ...?</i> </p>
<p>I don't think it's true. I've been in situations, and I'm sure you have, when I knew I was
presenting the right 
argument, but I couldn't convince anybody. Because they decided to do something else. It happens
all the 
time. It happens in personal life, in family arguments, social situations, and so on. Unless the
person 
who--maybe some Martian watching this can say, Jones won the argument. But unless Jones has the
power to 
implement it, it doesn't make any difference. </p>
<p><i>If you're working with a group or you're in some kind of organization or whatever, a
business, whatever 
it might happen to be, and suppose there is a degree of equity and fairness, at least formal, with
regard 
to decision-making, and you all sit around and make decisions, and one or two people have
knowledge of 
how the whole operation works and have at their fingertips a whole lot of information and facts
about 
what's going on and also are very verbal, and some of the other people have productive skills and 
various other skills that are associated with the business, but don't have that information at
their 
disposal, there isn't any doubt in my mind who's going to win nine times out of ten.</i> </p>
<p>Win what? </p>
<p><i>Policy decisions.</i> </p>
<p>The policy decisions. And who will win the decisions about how it's actually implemented? The
people 
with the productive skills. </p>
<p><i>No. Not necessarily at all.</i> </p>
<p>Why not? They're the ones who are going to do it. In a society with equity. We were assuming a
society with 
equity. Nobody has any power. They just have different capacities. </p>
<p><i>One person, one vote.</i> </p>
<p>All right, the person who makes the more convincing argument, assuming rationality, should
convince the 
others. But then the person who implements the decisions will do it his or her way. </p>
<p><i>Clearly the situation will be much better if everybody comes to a decision with a degree of
confidence 
and skills and so on that's commensurate to participating.</i> </p>
<p>That's what it means by being convinced. If you are convinced that this is the right thing to
do, it doesn't make 
any difference whether somebody else had the idea or you had the idea. You're equally convinced.
If you're 
not convinced, something went wrong. Then it was a situation of power and not a matter of greater
capacity 
to work things out. </p>
<p><i>Take a Yugoslav firm in the market system. The workers appoint a manager. The manager makes
a whole 
array of decisions that are the same as a manager would make in the Ford Motor Company. The
workers 
in fact agree that the manager's decisions make sense and should be implemented. They can't make
the 
decisions themselves, necessarily, because they don't have access to the facts. Still the
situation is pretty 
disgusting.</i> </p>
<p>There's a situation where there's a difference of power, and the power translates into access
to ... </p>
<p><i>What if the formal power rests with the workers?</i> </p>
<p>There's already a presupposition: the manager had more information and the manager got that
because the 
manager had more power. Otherwise the manager wouldn't have had more information. </p>
<p><i>The manager's job is to oversee all this information and put the stuff together.</i> </p>
<p>But if you divide jobs up that way you're imposing relations of power. </p>
<p><i>Exactly. That's what I'm getting at.</i> </p>
<p>But if we extract the power from the situation it won't be true. If everyone has the same
access to 
information, it still may turn out that the guy who happens to be the manager comes up with the
best idea and 
everybody says, Yeah, that's the best idea. Okay, fine. That's not a problem. We know that it's
not going to 
happen consistently. There's one area of human life that I know of which kind of approximates an
equitable 
situation. It isn't really equitable, but it approximates one. That's a scientific laboratory, a
scientific 
enterprise, where you have a senior professor who won a Nobel Prize and you have an undergraduate 
assistant, a lab technician and so on. If it's really working well, there's a lot of cooperation.
And you see it. It 
is not the case that the person with the more publications comes up with all the answers, by no
means. If 
they're really working together and trying to achieve something ... </p>
<p><i>Then it's a collective, or something. If you don't have structurally imposed differences in
decision making 
power or in access to information needed for developing agendas and positions, fine.</i> </p>
<p>It may be that the guy with the Nobel Prize will often come up with a good idea. Maybe not. In
fact, in these 
situations it typically isn't the case. It's often the graduate student. </p>
<p><i>After they've got a Nobel Prize they're already too old.</i> </p>
<p>Probably. Or they're too stuck in their ways. But the senior professor often has a contribution
to make that's 
unique: experience, remembering something that somebody did four years ago that nobody else ever
heard 
of. There are all kinds of ways in which people contribute to collective decisions. I don't see
any reason to 
believe that, say, a decision in a factory is so infinitely more complex than working on an
advanced 
scientific problem that you can expect one person to always have the right ideas. That's not going
to happen. 
If it happens, it's because of power differences. </p>
<p><i>An imbalance</i> in access to decision making or information or skills critical to it...
</p>
<p>And then we're back to where we were: eliminate the power differences, or strive to eliminate
them. </p>
<p><i>Let me switch gears a minute. Back to the question of animal rights, the broadening
understanding of 
human values and all that. How do you react to the debate around abortion?</i> </p>
<p>I think it's a hard one. I don't think the answers are simple. It's a case where there really
are conflicting 
values. Most human situations, the kinds of things we're in all the time, it's very rare that
there's a clear and 
simple answer. Sometimes the answers are very murky because we have different values and they just 
conflict. At least our understanding of our own moral values is not like an axiomatic system,
where there's an 
answer and not some other answer. There are what appear to be conflicting values which give
different 
answers. Maybe because we don't understand them well enough, or maybe they really are in conflict.
In this 
case they're straight conflicts. From one point of view, a child up to a point is an organ of the
mother's body. 
The mother ought to have the decision what to do. And that's true. From another point of view, the
organism 
is a potential human being, and it has rights. And those two things are in conflict. One biologist
I know once 
pointed out that you could say the same thing about women washing their hands. If a woman washes
her 
hands, lots of cells flake off, and in principle those cells have the genetic instructions for a
human being. You 
can imagine a future technology which would take one of them and create a human being from it. He
was 
making it as a reductio ad absurdum argument, but because there's an element of truth to it, an
element so tiny 
that it makes it a reductio ad absurdum argument, but it's not like saying something about
astrology. What he's 
saying is true. </p>
<p><i>There's a related argument I've found tough to deal with. Suppose you have a person who is a
surgeon 
who is so skilled she is the only one who can deal with this particular kind of ailment. There's a
sudden 
outbreak of the ailment. It only takes five minutes for the person to do what they do, but only
they can do 
it. So you could literally have an assembly line because there are so many people struck with this 
ailment, an assembly line of people flowing past this person. So if this person goes to the
bathroom or 
goes to eat a meal or goes to do anything, more people are going to die that would have been saved
had 
she not done that. What's this person supposed to do?</i> </p>
<p>It's like triage. A person is going to have to make an impossible choice among alternatives.
It's easy to 
construct situations like that. That's what they do in philosophy seminars all the time. We don't
agree with 
torture. There was an article in <i>Newsweek</i> by a philosopher whose hidden agenda was that you
shouldn't 
criticize Israel for torturing Arabs. The argument was like an elementary philosophy seminar.
People say 
torture is bad. But is it really bad? Suppose there was a doomsday machine that was about to go
off and 
blow up the universe. There was one person who knew how to stop it, but he wasn't telling us how
to stop it. 
The only way you would get it out of him was by torturing him. Under those circumstances would
torture be 
okay? You say, Okay, under those circumstances. Then, Aha! You're not opposed to torture. Let's
move it a 
little bit over. You get into what's called a &quot;slippery slope argument.&quot; You can play
this game all the time. 
You can make up situations in which usually conflicting values lead to what would ordinarily be
ridiculous 
conclusions under other circumstances. And the trouble is, life often poses such circumstances.
You don't 
have to make them up. The abortion issue is one where life is posing those choices. </p>
<p><i>You think that the choice there isn't that it is or isn't a person. You just basically have
to admit that it's a 
potential person, it's an actual organ in a sense.</i> </p>
<p>We don't have have a clear conception of what a person is. I think a reasonable proposal is
that it changes 
from an organ to a person when it's viable. But that's arguable and it's not very clear when it
is. That's why 
this biologist pointed out it could be when the woman was washing her hands, depending on the
state of 
technology. But that's life. You're faced with hard decisions of conflicting values. </p>
<p><i>Changing gear again: Take the last thirty years, say, from the New Left to the present, and
look at it as a 
span of political activism in the U.S. Leftists seem to do this, as far as I can tell, very
infrequently. Try 
and basically say, What lessons are there in that? Is whatever we achieved the most we could have 
achieved? Did the people who were acting, were they doing basically about as well as one could
expect, 
or were there horrible failures? Was there some impediment that was being overlooked, some
obstacle to 
having greater success that we just didn't think of and we didn't deal with, and had we dealt with
that we 
would have done better? In other words, how do you view the period? Certainly people of my
generation, 
a great many of them, right now are very frustrated. They're feeling like, Thirty years ago I made
this 
choice. It's thirty years later and it hasn't gone where I thought it was going to go.</i> </p>
<p>I think, first of all, where they thought it was going to go was pretty unrealistic. I think if
you look at what's 
happened in thirty years, it's a lot better than it was. A lot of this stuff got started during
the Vietnam War. At 
the ideological level, all of us who were opposed to the war lost flat out within the mainstream
institutions. 
The question now is, have the Vietnamese done enough to compensate us for the crimes that they
committed 
against us? In the newspapers or the journals or the books that's the only question you're allowed
to discuss. 
If you want to be part of the educated culture, the elite culture, the only question you can pose.
I actually have 
been through a lot of the newspapers on this, out of curiosity. Also the POW issue. George Bush
gets up and 
says, The Vietnamese should understand that we bear them no permanent grudge. We're not going to
make 
them pay for everything they did to us. If they finally come clean and devote their entire lives
and every last 
resource they have to searching for the remains of one of those people they viciously blew out of
the sky, 
then maybe we'll allow them entry into the civilized world. And there won't be one editorial
writer or 
columnist who will either fall on the floor laughing or else say, this guy's worse than the Nazis.
Because 
that's the way they all are. The only issue is, Will we forgive them for the crimes they committed
against us? 
So at that level, we just lost the whole discussion. On the other hand, let's go to the general
population. To 
this day, after twenty-five years of this endless, unremitting propaganda, to which no response is
ever 
tolerated, 70% of the population disagrees with the elite culture. That tells you there's a
victory at this level. 
If 70% of the population, after all this brainwashing, still says, as late as 1990, the war was
fundamentally 
wrong and immoral, not a mistake, something got through. </p>
<p><i>Absolutely. And it tells us that for a period of six, seven years, however many years, the
activism that 
people engaged in had a tremendous and long-lasting effect. But it doesn't answer people's concern
that 
after thirty years the size of our organizations, the degree of organized dissent, the ability to
amass new 
movements when new crises arise, or even, much more important, the ability to have sustained 
movements which are striking at ongoing institutional structures, on these axes there doesn't seem
to be 
...</i> </p>
<p>I think that's an inaccurate reading of history. In fact, I think the opposite is the case. The
last big such crisis 
was the Gulf War. I just disagree with a lot of my friends on that one, including most activists
on the left. 
They regarded what happened as a catastrophe for the left, and as a proof of what you just said. I
regard it as 
the opposite. This is the first time in history that I know of that big demonstrations started
before a war. Take 
a look at the Vietnam War. After all, Kennedy started bombing South Vietnam in 1961-62. It was
years 
before there was significant opposition. </p>
<p><i>That was my impression, too. I was incredulous at the speed at which the movement was able
to make 
itself felt, visibly, around the Gulf...</i> </p>
<p>It was unbelievable. The thing that we should remember is, people in power know it. They might
not want us 
to know it, but they know it. It's even clear from their own documents, as well as from what they
do. The day 
the ground combat started in the Gulf War a very important document leaked. It was sort of buried
in the 
papers, and most people missed it. It was the last paragraph of an article on something else. They
leaked an 
early Bush administration planning document on Third World intervention. What it said was--and it
still 
holds--that in the case of confrontations with much weaker enemies--meaning anyone we're willing
to 
fight--we must not only defeat them but we must defeat them decisively and rapidly because
anything else 
will undercut political support. That's a tremendous victory for the left. These guys understand
that they don't 
have the option of carrying out intervention unless they carry out decisive, rapid victories over
totally 
defenseless enemies before anyone notices, after having first demonized them. </p>
<p><i>I agree with you completely about the speed and scale of the response. And yet, it is the
case that you 
describe having to argue with most of your friends. I encountered the same situation. It's a
remarkable 
fact that we don't seem to be able to perceive, as a movement or as a body of people, our own
effectivity.</i> </p>
<p>Of course nobody wants you to see it. In order to perceive it, it's as if you lived in a world
where everybody 
told you--television, radio, books, everything else--that the world is flat. It's Winston Smith in
<i>1984</i>. He's 
trying to hold on to the truth that two plus two equals four. Everybody says two plus two equals
five. He 
remembers inside that two plus two equals four. It's hard to hold on to that truth. Especially
when you're 
isolated. </p>
<p><i>So what's the trick?</i> </p>
<p>The trick is not to be isolated. If you're isolated, like Winston Smith, you're sooner or later
going to break, as 
he finally broke. That was the point of Orwell's story. That's the whole tradition of
totalitarianism: keep 
people isolated and you can get them to believe anything. The genius of American democracy has
been to 
tolerate the formal freedoms that have been won through popular struggle but to eliminate any
substance from 
them by just isolating people. And people are isolated. They're stuck in front of the tube. There
are no 
associations. That's part of the fervor behind getting rid of unions. They're one of the natural
means--not the 
only one--by which ordinary people come together. So you've got to destroy them. That's one of the
reasons 
why it's very important that we have no real political parties, because people could get together
and do stuff. </p>
<p><i>But what it says is that a left which creates a culture and which creates the possibility of
actually 
working together, being friends, communicating with one another will be much less susceptible to
this 
coercion. When I consider now versus thirty years ago, I have this feeling that's there a
fundamental 
change, as atomized as it was then, it's much more so now. People just don't have friends. Nobody
has 
people who they trust, who they're friends with, who they interact with on a regular, ongoing
basis. Not 
nobody, but there's much less of that there was then.</i> </p>
<p>I'm not so sure there's less of it. I suspect that there's probably more of it, but it's in
different circles. So for 
example, take the big movements of the last ... </p>
<p><i>I'm not talking about movements. I'm talking about just normal, everyday life. My parents,
my friends, all 
the people I know.</i> </p>
<p>So what about the people in Witness for Peace, for example? They're mostly church-based, and
their friends 
and associations are usually through churches, often even fundamentalist churches. But they have
real friends 
and associations and work together. </p>
<p><i>That's one of those institutions ...</i> </p>
<p>But these things bring in huge numbers of people. That's why I say I think it's shifted. In
fact, it's shifted 
towards different sectors of the population. In fact, they've become a lot more mainstream. During
the sixties, 
it was kind of kids at universities who were the ones who had these associations and the political
activism 
to a significant extent. There was a lot of that. Not everything, of course, but that was quite a
bit of it. It's 
true, there things have in fact declined. But other parts of society have increased and are
deepened. </p>
<p><i>The left has never offered it per se. The CP did, once upon a time. But the modern left,
from the new left 
to now, has offered rallies and demonstrations. It's offered teach-ins. It's offered talks. But
it's never 
offered ...</i> </p>
<p>What do you call the ... what do you think the right name is for these church-based Central
America 
solidarity groups? Are they &quot;left&quot;? I would call it left. </p>
<p><i>They are setting a better model, perhaps, than anything that the left has had to offer.</i>
</p>
<p>I don't think they're all that separate. A lot of people in them are people who came through
sixties 
experiences, which affected everything. They affected the whole culture very broadly. The reason
that so 
many things grow out of the churches is that that's the one kind of organic institution that
hasn't been 
destroyed. They don't come out of labor unions in the country because we don't have unions. If I
give a talk in 
Europe, up till pretty recently, even now, it could often be in a union hall. Not necessarily
labor people, but 
just community people. I can't remember ever having done that in the U.S. It's usually a church.
That exists. 
That's the one institution that hasn't been destroyed. So that's where things, all the movement
offices are in 
the basement of some church. They're around. </p>
<p><i>That's always been true.</i> </p>
<p>Because that's the only thing that's around. But out of that have come other things, people who
would not 
regard themselves ... they never read a Marxist-Leninist book in their lives and they don't care.
Maybe their 
background is liberation theology. I think that's part of our movement, at least I've always
regarded it that 
way. And the same with people who are involved in all sorts of other issues. </p>
<p><i>To what extent would you consider yourself somehow part of the same movement as
Marxist-Leninists?</i> </p>
<p>There are personal friendships and contacts, but I don't really feel much empathy with it. For
one thing I don't 
understand a lot of it. What I do understand I usually don't like. I don't want to say that I
haven't learned 
anything from them or that I don't hold personal relations; in fact I do support all of the groups
and will 
continue to as long as they do things I like. But I do feel a certain closeness ... the beliefs of
the church-based 
groups are just incomprehensible to me, but I do feel a certain empathy with them that I don't
feel with what 
are called official left groups. </p>
<p><i>You'd rather have them at your side, in some sense.</i> </p>
<p>Yeah. Like when I went down to Nicaragua and I lived in the Jesuit house. I was wondering, What
the heck 
am I doing here? But that's where I felt at home. </p>
<p><i>They were ethical</i>. </p>
<p>Some sort of shared values. For me personally it was sort of weird, because just out of
personal experience, 
aside from having nothing to do with organized religion or anything, I happened to grow up in an
area in 
Philadelphia which was Irish and German Catholic, mostly. We were the only Jewish family around. I
grew 
up with a visceral fear of Catholics. They're the people who beat you up on your way to school. So
I knew 
when they came out of that building down the street, which was the Jesuit school, they were raving 
anti-Semites. So childhood memories took a long time to overcome. </p>
<p><i>As long as we're switching over, we have the church as an institution being a possible place
where people 
can talk, develop ideas, develop agendas. But what about the church as an impediment to social
change?</i> </p>
<p>That's what it's been through most of its history. What was remarkable in the last thirty,
forty, fifty years is a 
radical change in the church, the Catholic Church, and which also showed up in many of the
Protestant 
churches. There was a big change. The reason why the U.S. launched this terrorist war in Central
America 
was to destroy this. People now talk as if the big enemy is Islamic fundamentalism. But they're
forgetting 
something. For the last ten years the big enemy has been the Catholic Church, more of an enemy
than Islamic 
fundamentalism. They had to destroy it. When Americas Watch did their wrap-up study on the 1980s,
they 
pointed out that it was a decade framed by the murder of the Archbishop in 1980 and the murder of
six Jesuit 
intellectuals in 1989. That wasn't accidental. The main target of attack was the church, because
it had 
become a part, not entirely, but part of it had become a church devoted to liberation, to the
poor. Sectors of 
the church did undertake what they called the preferential option for the poor, and very
consciously. They 
recognized that for hundreds of years it had been the church of the rich and the oppressors, who
were telling 
the poor, This is your fate. Accept it. A critically important sector of the church changed,
important enough 
to include the dominant elements among the Latin American bishops, which set off the atrocities
over the last 
ten years, in which the U.S. has vigorously participated. </p>
<p><i>The change is just an accident of history?</i> </p>
<p>I don't know enough about the internal dynamics of it to explain it. </p>
<p><i>What do you think religion is?</i> </p>
<p>Obviously, it means something to people, a lot. It doesn't to me. I don't understand it. I sort
of understand it, 
but I can't empathize with it. To me it's just another set of irrational beliefs. You can believe
this, you can 
believe that if you want. I don't understand why people should need irrational beliefs. Apparently
many 
people seem to find a good deal of fulfillment in it. </p>
<p><i>Including lots of scientists. I was quite struck by that recently, finding all these
physicists, chemists, 
biologists ...</i> </p>
<p>Honestly, I'm pretty skeptical when I read that stuff. </p>
<p><i>Some of those interviews are astounding.</i> </p>
<p>I remember once a close associate of Einstein's once told me, as a sort of a semi-joke,
Einstein was always 
saying famous things ... </p>
<p><i>He always talks about God.</i> </p>
<p>She told me that when he says God he means &quot;I.&quot; &quot;God doesn't play dice with the
cosmos&quot; means &quot;I don't 
believe in this stuff.&quot; When scientists talk about God and this, it reminds me a little bit
of when Robert 
Oppenheimer used to talk about Persian poetry. One of the ways in which scientists try to look
like, well, ... 
if they're not really civilized beings, the way they try to look like civilized beings is by doing
things that they 
think are deep. Like you read Persian poetry or you think about Buddha or something like that. But
that's 
always struck me as something of an affectation. It's striking that this kind of talk about God
was not true of 
the generation of scientists, say, from Boer, Planck, Max Born and Einstein, the great period of
modern 
science. It wasn't true. And there was a level of culture and civilization there that was real,
that was not 
duplicated in twentieth-century America. I think this is true of a lot of things. For example, I
don't think 
people of that generation would have named their particles &quot;quarks,&quot; trying to show how
smart they are 
because they read <i>Finnegan's Wake</i>. They didn't have to show anybody how smart they were.
They were 
smart and cultivated and educated. You didn't have to make everybody remember, He read
<i>Finnegan's 
Wake</i>. </p>
<p><i>Murray Gell Mann is quite smart.</i> </p>
<p>&quot;Smart&quot; and &quot;cultivated&quot; are not the same thing. And it's not a matter of
persons. It's a matter of the whole 
intellectual culture. The intellectual culture of Central Europe. </p>
<p><i>It's also what's supported and what's not.</i> </p>
<p>The intellectual culture of Central Europe out of which a lot of this grew was qualitatively
different from that 
of twentieth-century America. </p>
<p><i>I recently read a book by a guy named Steven Weinberg, who's a Nobel Prize-winning
physicist, very, 
very brilliant. And it is quite fascinating. The book not only makes difficult ideas accessible,
but it's 
written in a very straight-forward way with no pretense. It feels wise, almost elegant in some
sense.</i> </p>
<p>I knew him when he was at MIT, and I felt that. </p>
<p><i>A lot of these guys can write that way, which you don't find coming out of the soft
sciences. You won't find 
an economist writing a book about economics like that.</i> </p>
<p>That's true. First of all, there's not much to say. But it's certainly true. On the other hand,
you were talking 
about the novel ... this turning to divinity, and does the Big Bang tell us something about the
creator. I think 
it's fairly recent in science. It's a pretty common thing. A lot of people write popular books
about science 
now. They think you have to say that. And they didn't think they to say it forty years ago. And
that's a cultural 
change. </p>
<p><i>It is a kind of different dimension, when you're talking forty, fifty years ago and you're
talking about 
particles in the lab. Now they're talking about one-trillionth of a second after the whatever it
was at the 
beginning.</i> </p>
<p>I don't think in terms of a conceptual revolution it's anything like the early quantum theory.
</p>
<p><i>No, it's not</i>. </p>
<p>OK, so why didn't they say it? I think it's because they came from a different intellectual
culture, where you 
didn't have to show that you were capable of dealing with the so-called &quot;big ideas,&quot;
because you were. </p>
<p><i>That's America.</i> </p>
<p>Yeah, I think that's twentieth-century America, a technological civilization. </p>
<p><i>It's remarkable how religious this country is.</i> </p>
<p>It's unbelievable. It's not just that it's religious ... if you look at the comparative
studies, there's a lot of 
comparative studies of religious beliefs. The U.S. is off the chart. It's like a devastated
peasant society. </p>
<p><i>If you watch TV and watch sports events where they interview people after they've done an
event, 
regarding China you hear jokes about how they used to say, I read Mao and he helped me jump and 
taught me how to do this high jump and I won the Olympic event. But that's also the way the
Americans 
sound. Except it's God. The first thing out of their mouth is always, I thank God.</i> </p>
<p>It's shocking, just looking at the studies, which are interesting. I was just looking at one by
Andrew Greeley 
which was a cross-cultural study. It turns out that 75% of Americans literally believe in
religious miracles, 
for example. You can't find that anywhere else. </p>
<p><i>But what does that mean? Deeper, what does it mean if you go up to somebody on the street
and they say, 
I'm one of those 75%? What does that mean?</i> </p>
<p>Either it means that they think they have to say it or they literally believe it. Either way
it's the same. It shows 
that there are features of the society which are off the chart with regard to industrial
societies. I have a 
feeling that it may be related to the sense ... there are other things which are striking, too.
There is an 
increasing sense that nothing is responsive to me. The institutions don't work for me at all. In
fact, that figure 
goes higher and higher every year. It's now hitting over two-thirds of the population, which is
astonishing. 
83% of the population thinks that the entire economic system is inherently unfair. </p>
<p><i>But the two together ... think that the economic system is unfair, they also think that
there's nothing that 
they can do about it.</i> </p>
<p>That's why I think they're connected. </p>
<p><i>Religion is the ...</i> </p>
<p>That's why I say it's like a devastated peasant society. In a society where people feel, I
can't do anything, you 
turn to something supernatural. It's happening in Central America right now. The evangelical
churches 
coming down with the story, Don't worry about this miserable existence. It doesn't matter anyway.
Things 
will be better later. They're gaining considerable success in the wake of murderous destruction of
social 
reform movements. </p>
<p><i>There's an element which makes sense. If you live under those conditions, then they're not
likely to 
change unless you're trying to eke out the best possible existence you can, this kind of
thing.</i> </p>
<p>Maybe. These are phenomena that have been looked at for a long time. Walter Dean Vernon was one
of the 
social scientists who looked at it about ten, twelve years ago. He wrote about back to the
nineteenth century 
there seemed to be a correlation between the lack of, say, worker organization and other popular 
organization in the U.S. and the lack of political differentiation and political ideal and so on
on the one hand 
and the surprising degree of religious commitment on the other. It's possible that they're
correlated. If you go 
back, there are other things to look at. The cheriastic elements in the church, millennial
movements in the 
church, we're on the verge, the Messiah is coming, or wait till the Messiah, that kind of
businesses, did 
regularly arise and was often even stimulated at times of social struggle or the collapse of
social struggle. </p>
<p><i>That's oppression.</i> </p>
<p>That kind of thing. A.P. Thompson writes about that in <i>The Making of the English Working
Class</i> at the 
beginning of the nineteenth century. It goes right through the nineteenth century in the U.S.
Actually, business 
even supported evangelical preachers to try to ... in fact, you see it right now in the Islamic
world. Take 
these 415 people who were kicked out of Israel from Hamas. Israel had supported the Islamic
fundamentalist 
movement openly, as a counterweight to secular nationalism, which is what really bothered them.
They were 
afraid of secular nationalism which would make accommodations, proposals, they would have to deal
with 
these issues politically, which they didn't want to do. It got to the point where they were
literally shipping 
Islamic fundamentalist young people to break up strikes by secular nationalist students on the
West Bank. 
Well, they got what they wanted. Islamic fundamentalists. And it's happening throughout the Arab
world, the 
rise of Islamic fundamentalism, which people talk about as this horrible thing which is very
perplexing. Part 
of it is a reaction to the failure of secular nationalism. That failure has a number of reasons,
one of them 
being Western hostility to it. Sure, you take away people's hopes and they'll turn to something
else. </p>
<p><i>Next time we get together, perhaps we should start there, trying to work through what there
is to be 
hopeful about, what, in more detail, is the goal we are striving for, what, in more detail, are
the 
structures standing between us and that goal, and even, in more detail, what kind of activism and 
organization on our part might overcome those obstacles and attain the sought goals. But, for now, 
Thank you.</i> </p>

<P>Excerpts from <CITE><A HREF="../year/year.html">Year 501: The Conquest Continues</A></CITE>
</CENTER>

<H3>From the Introduction</H3>

<P>Other experiments have commonly turned out the same way. In his study of another long-time "testing area," Liberia, anthropologist Gordon Thomasson found the same "irrational disdain" for native intellectual achievement, and the same severe costs -- for the local population. Over the centuries, the Kpelle peoples had developed hundreds of varieties of rice that were matched precisely to microenvironments in particular ecosystems; dozens of different seeds might be planted in a small field, with very high yields. US agronomists advised capital-intensive "green revolution" techniques using petrochemical inputs which, apart from being far too costly for a poor country, bring lower yields and loss of the traditional knowledge and the wide variety of seeds that have been bred, selected, diversified and maintained over centuries. Thomasson estimates that agricultural productivity will be cut by as much as 50% if the rich genetic pool of rice varieties, "the product of centuries of self-conscious breeding and selection," is lost and replaced by foreign inputs: "many areas of rural Liberia will for all intents and purposes cease to exist, and so will many of Liberia's indigenous cultures." The disdain of the experts, in this case, was heightened by the fact that this was "women's knowledge," transmitted by older women to young girls who spent much time acquiring the skills and lore.

<P>Following standard doctrine, US experts also advised Liberia to convert farmland to plantation cash crops (which, incidentally, happen to benefit US corporations). The resulting shortfalls led USAID to push the development of paddy rice in swamps, ignoring a World Health Organization effort to keep people out of these regions because of extreme health hazards.

<P>The Kpelle had also developed sophisticated metallurgical technology, providing highly efficient tools. In this case, their achievements were "killed by colonialism and monopoly capitalism, not because the product it produced was in any way inferior or overpriced in the marketplace," but by means of subsidies to coastal merchants and other market destortions designed by the economic experts and imposed by the US-controlled governments, "eventually destroying the economy, currency, and indigenous industry." Again, there were beneficiaries as well: multinational mining concessions, foreign producers who supplied the importers, and banks outside Liberia to which they ship their profits.

<P>Chalk up another notable success of neoclassical and monetarist "free market" theories.<FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1" HREF="#FN1"><SUP>1</SUP></A></FONT>

<P>Students of US diplomatic history might recognize that it is unfair to take Liberia and Haiti as illustrations. As Wilson's Secretary of State Robert Lansing explained,<FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2" HREF="#FN2"><SUP>2</SUP></A></FONT> "The experience of Liberia and Haiti show that the African race are devoid of any capacity for political organization and lack genius for government. Unquestionably there is an inherent tendency to revert to savagery and to cast aside the shackles of civilization which are irksome to their physical nature,...as we know from experience in this country. It is that which makes the negro problem practically unsolvable," and perhaps accounts for the results of the experiments in Liberia and Haiti -- which, however, are duplicated throughout the Third World.

<P><HR>

<P><H3>From "The Dangers of 'Intellectual Property Rights' Provisions"</H3>

<P>The US National Institutes of Health are engaged in what the <CITE>Wall Street Journal</CITE> calls "the biggest race for property since the great land rush of 1889," in this case, "staking U.S. patent claims to thousands of pieces of genetic material -- DNA -- that NIH scientists are certain are fragments of unknown genes." The purpose, the NIH explains, is to ensure that US corporations dominate the biotechnology business, which the government expects "to be generating annual revenue of $50 billion by the year 2000," and vastly more beyond. A recent patent for a basic human blood cell could allow a California company to "corner the market for a broad array of life-saving technologies," to cite merely one example. The biotech business took off after a 1980 Supreme Court decision granting a patent for an oil-dissolving microorganism developed through genetic engineering, the <CITE>Journal</CITE> observes.

<P>The prospects are considered to be expansive. To convey a sense of the prospects, one researcher remarks that some way down the road, parents might even have to pay royalties for having children. Medical procedures such as bone-marrow transplants and gene-based therapies will also be protected by patent. The same could be true of engineered animals, seeds, and other organisms. We are now speaking of control of the essentials of life. By comparison, electronics deals with mere conveniences.<FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3" HREF="#FN3"><SUP>3</SUP></A></FONT>

<P>These developments give new urgency to the US demand for increased protection for "intellectual property" -- crucially including patents -- at the ongoing GATT negotiations. These protectionist measures are needed to ensure that US corporations dominate the health and agricultural industries, thus controlling the essentials for human life; and to guarantee to US pharmaceutical corporations huge profits on drugs that are priced far beyond the reach of taxpayers who fund the research, let alone the bulk of the world's population. "Basic biomedical research has long been heavily subsidized by United States taxpayers," the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> business pages observe, and "high-tech pharmaceuticals owe their origin largely to these investments and to Government scientists," funded by billions of taxpayer dollars for the National Institutes of Health and for University research. But drugs created through genetic engineering and other state subsidy are priced beyond the reach of those who pay for their development. Protection of "intellectual property" is designed to guarantee monopoly profits to the publicly-subsidized corporations, not to benefit those who pay; and the South must be denied the right to produce drugs, seeds, and other necessities at a fraction of the cost.

<P>On similar grounds, the US has refused to sign a treaty on preserving the world's biological species. The Assistant Secretary of State for the Environment, Curtis Bohlen, said that the treaty "fails to give adequate patent protection to American companies that transfer biotechnology to developing companies," and "tries to regulate genetically engineered materials, a competitive area in which the United States leads," the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> reports.<FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT4" HREF="#FN4"><SUP>4</SUP></A></FONT>

<P>The US International Trade Commission estimates that US companies stand to gain $61 billion a year from the Third World if "intellectual property" rights are protected in accord with US demands, a cost to the South of somewhere between $100-300 billion when extrapolated to the other industrial countries, dwarfing the debt service flow of capital from South to North. The same US demands will require poor farmers to pay royalties to TNCs for seeds, denying them the traditional right to re-use seeds from their harvests. Cloned varieties of commercial crops exported by the South (palm oil, cotton, rubber, etc.) will also be commercial property, subject to increased royalties. "The main beneficiaries will be the core group of less than a dozen seeds and pharmaceuticals companies which control over 70 per cent of world seeds trade," and agribusiness generally, Kevin Watkins observes in a recent study for the Catholic Institute of International Relations in London.<FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT5" HREF="#FN5"><SUP>5</SUP></A></FONT>

<P>While the US seeks to ensure monopoly control for the future, the same drug companies it protects are cheerfully exploiting the accumulated knowledge of indigenous cultures for products that bring in some $100 billion profits annually, offering virtually nothing in return to the native people who lead researchers to the medicines, seeds, and other products they have developed and refined over thousands of years. "The annual world market value for medicines derived from medicinal plants discovered from indigenous peoples is US $43 billion," ethnobotanist Darrell Posey estimates. "Less than 0.001% of the profits from drugs that originated from traditional medicine have ever gone to the indigenous people who led researchers to them." Profits of at least the same scale derive from natural insecticides, insect repellents, and plant genetic materials, he believes. The international seed industry alone accounts for some $15 billion a year, based in large measure on genetic materials from crop varieties "selected, nurtured, improved and developed by innovative Third World farmers for hundreds, even thousands of years," Maria Elena Hurtado adds.<FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT6" HREF="#FN6"><SUP>6</SUP></A></FONT>

<P>Only the knowledge of the rich and powerful merits protection.

<P>Before gaining its current dominance, the US did not abide by the rules it now seeks to impose. In the 19th century, the US rejected foreign claims to intellectual property rights on grounds that they would hamper its economic development. Japan followed the same course.<FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT7" HREF="#FN7"><SUP>7</SUP></A></FONT> And today, the concept of "intellectual property rights" is finely crafted to suit the needs of the powerful. Exactly as in the case of "free trade," the subjects in the new imperial age are to be denied any recourse to the methods that were used by the "rich men dwelling at peace within their habitations."

<P>This combination of plans by the rulers of the new imperial age is viewed from the South as "an act of unbridled piracy," Watkins observes, given the fact that the genetic materials used by the Western corporations to create their patented and protected products are derived from Third World crops and wild plants, cultivated, refined, and identified over countless generations. The seed and pharmaceutical companies thus "reap monopoly profits, while the genius of the Third World farmers, past and present, in selecting and developing individual seed strains goes unrewarded." The New World Order as a whole is described by Egypt's leading newspaper, <CITE>al-Ahram,</CITE> as "codified international piracy," referring in this case to the efforts of the Bush Administration to set up a confrontation with Qaddafi for domestic political purposes in the manner that has become routine since Libya's utility as a cheap punching bag was recognized by Reaganite PR specialists in 1981. The terminology is apt enough. "Let President Bush find some other issue for his election campaign," one columnist wrote.<FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT8" HREF="#FN8"><SUP>8</SUP></A></FONT>

<P>The unbridled piracy takes on increased urgency as indigenous agriculture and knowledge are undermined in favor of ecologically unsustainable agroexport in the interests of the TNCs, and the biological resources of the South -- the world's richest by far -- are sharply reduced, raising the danger of disease and blight to potentially catastrophic levels. To whatever extent biotechnology may provide a remedy, the effect again will be to transfer power and wealth to the rulers of the new imperial age, if the demands of the corporations for increased protection are implemented. That they will be is almost a foregone conclusion, given the distribution of power and the insulation of decision-making from public interference in the new imperial age.

<P>The tendencies towards the new imperial age heralded by the international financial press are obvious and understandable, along with the extension of the North-South divide to the habitations of the rich. There are also countertendencies. Throughout the North, notably in the US, much has changed in the past 30 years, at least in the cultural and moral spheres, if not at the institutional level. Had the quincentennial of the Old World Order been in 1962, it would have been celebrated once again as the liberation of the hemisphere. Today, that is impossible, just as few can blandly talk of our task of "felling trees and Indians." The European invasion is now officially an "encounter," though large sectors of the population rightly reject that euphemism as only somewhat less offensive. The domestic constraints on state violence that are fully recognized by the US political leadership are another case in point. Many were depressed by the inability of the peace movement to prevent the Gulf war, failing to recall that perhaps for the first time ever, large-scale protests actually preceded the bombing, a radical change from the US assault against South Vietnam 30 years ago. The ferment of the 60's reached much wider circles in the years that followed, eliciting new sensitivity to racist and sexist oppression, concern for the environment, respect for other cultures and for human rights. One of the most striking examples is the Third World solidarity movements of the 1980s, with their unprecedented engagement in the lives and fate of the victims. This process of democratization and concern for social justice could have large significance.

<P>Such developments are perceived to be dangerous and subversive by the powerful, and bitterly denounced, often in tones of real hysteria. That too is understandable: these countertendencies do threaten the vile maxim of the masters, and all that follows from it. They also offer the only real hope for the great mass of people in the world, even for the survival of the human species in an era of environmental and other global problems that cannot be faced by primitive social and cultural structures that are driven by short term material gain, and that regard human beings as mere instruments, not ends.

<H1>Naomi Chase Interviews Noam Chomsky</H1>


<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Institute Professor Noam Chomsky is the 1991-92 Killian Faculty Achievement Award recipient. He will present the Killian Lecture, Language and the "Cognitive Revolution," Wednesday, April 8, at 4:30pm in Kresge Auditorium. Naomi F. Chase of the News Office interviewed him recently about his work.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</CENTER>


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Naomi Chase:</B> How did you get into linguistics?</FONT>


<P><B>Noam Chomsky:</B> By a back door. The work I did as a graduate student was not really regarded as linguistics. Linguistics was part of behavioral science, what's called structuralism. You had an array of data and various methods for finding structural patterns in which they fit.


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Chase:</B> Is that phonetics? Could you give me an example?</FONT>


<P><B>Chomsky:</B> A standard graduate student assignment would be to go to some American Indian community, take down texts, then try to determine from the text whether there are patterns in which the sounds appear. Two phonetically different sounds might really be the same element in the structural patterns of the language. First, you had to find the phonemes, the significant sounds of the language. It's not just phonetics, it's words and something in between them. Then you try to find meaningful sequences of phonemes, which are called morphemes, and then patterns in which they appear. This is done by essentially taxonomic techniques that reduce behavior, according to the texts, into organized and meaningful patterns. As an undergraduate, I tried to refine the techniques. But I was also doing work on my own that had no real academic home. 


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Chase:</B> What kind of work?</FONT>


<P><B>Chomsky:</B> I was trying to use language to get a theoretical understanding of what goes on in the mind of the speaker. What capacities does the speaker or hearer have that enable them to carry out the behavior and what are the fixed capacities of the species that allow these individual capacities to develop? It has no relationship to what used to be called linguistics. 


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Chase:</B> Because it's biologically rather than behaviorally centered?</FONT>


<P><B>Chomsky:</B> The question is: what do you think behavior is? You can regard behavior as the topic of inquiry and you're trying to get an organized account of it. Or you can regard behavior as just data. There's a crucial difference between data and evidence. Data is just phenomena around you. Evidence is a relational notion. Something is evidence for something else. The second approach would say that data, or behavior, is interesting in so far as it is evidence for theoretical understanding. For me, the topic of inquiry is not the noises that you and I are making. That's just a way of helping us get to the topic of inquiry and learn something about it. The topic of inquiry is: what's going on in our minds? Now, if the data of our interactions help you find out about that, good. If those data don't help you find out about that, throw them away. If some psychological experiment would help you find out about that, fine. If biochemistry would someday help you find out about that, that's fine too. The important thing is that the topic of inquiry has just radically shifted. It is no longer the texts. You could think of it as somewhat analogous to the difference between -- roughly speaking -- natural history and natural science. There are various ways in which you can look at flowers and animals. If they are the topic of your inquiry, you write Newcomb's Wild Flower Guide, which describes flowers and leaves so you can recognize them on a walk in the woods. Or you write the Audubon Guide to Birds. 


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Chase:</B> They're both natural history. </FONT>


<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Yes. Their concern is the phenomena themselves, the flowers, the birds, an organized, systematic account of the phenomena.


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Chase:</B> What does natural science do?</FONT>


<P><B>Chomsky:</B> It's quite different. The phenomena are of interest insofar as they teach you something about the laws of nature. What you're interested in is the laws of nature, which could be very general, like the laws of mechanics. Or you could be interested in the nature of a particular organism. What makes the visual cortex work the way it does, for example. The phenomena are of interest only insofar as they guide you to that understanding. You might be interested in the difference between a robin and a cardinal because it tells you something about the nature of the birds.


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Chase:</B> You were interested in the laws of nature which govern speech?</FONT>


<P><B>Chomsky:</B> I was interested in the laws of nature which govern human thinking. 


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Chase:</B> What is the relationship of language to thinking?</FONT>


<P><B>Chomsky:</B> We can't answer that because we have no clear conception of what thinking is apart from some of its manifestations. Some of the manifestations of thinking are language and, of course, there has to be a close relation. Introspectively we're often very conscious of thinking in words. But we're also conscious of thinking without words. For example, it's common experience to say something and retract it, to say, "No, that's not what I meant." Then I'll try saying it a different way and finally I'll formulate what I really meant. How do we interpret that? Presumably, I intended to express a certain thought -- whatever that means. I tried, but the linguistic mechanism didn't quite work. I compared it with the thought I had in mind. Insofar as experiences like that are real, we can see that thought and language are not the same thing. 


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Chase:</B> So you solve the problems without needing to articulate them?</FONT>


<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Right. Here's another example. You recognize someone as the same person you saw before somewhere. There's plenty of thinking going on, but there's no way of describing it, and there is no reason to doubt that animals do something very much like what we do at some level. 


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Chase:</B> I`ve read that psychologist Peter Marler who has done work on bird song says, "The ability to hear rhythm seems to be present early in animal evolution but the ability to hear pitch relations may be unique in humans." He also says that "For too long those studying language development in people have over-emphasized cultural and social influences at the expense of the biological side." Isn't that what you're saying, too? </FONT>


<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Our work emphasized the biological side from the very beginning. We've assumed that the capacities you and I have, to speak and understand, extend vastly beyond our experience. Now, from a behavioral science point of view that comes as quite a shock. In the 1950's if you asked people in psychology or linguistics to comment on how language is acquired, they would say the big problem is why it's so hard to acquire such a simple thing. The standard problem was thought to be one of over-learning. Why does it take so much time for the child to pick up this trivial thing? As soon as we begin to look seriously at the capacities that you and I have, instead of just organizing data around us, we find that the problem is the exact opposite. How do we know so much, having had such impoverished exposure? 


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Chase:</B> When you say "know so much," you're talking about language?</FONT>


<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Yes. You hear sentences now that are radically different from those you've heard in the past. But you can understand them. And if I shifted a couple of words around, you'd recognize it to be gibberish. That's what goes on in normal speech and when you look at it closely, you quickly discover that the properties of language that you and I have mastered, or any child has mastered -- even the most simple properties -- involve things for which we have had minimal, if any, exposure. That's true with the simplest part of language, like word learning. You learn the meaning of a word -- but meaning is a very complicated thing. A dictionary doesn't come close to defining any word. It only gives hints that you can use as an intelligent human. If you really try to give a precise characterization of a word like "house" or "chase," you'll find it's remarkably intricate. 


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Chase:</B> Could you give me an example.</FONT>


<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Take, say, the word "building." If I say that somebody sees Building 20, the building we're in, you know they are outside. Right?


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Chase:</B> Right.</FONT>


<P><B>Chomsky:</B> The only way you and I could see Building 20, sitting where we are, is if there were a mirror outside that window, and we looked at the mirror and saw Building 20 reflected. That already tells us that a building, or a box, or a house, is not just the physical entity itself. Rather its exterior surface has a special status. There's other evidence that supports the same conclusion. Words like "house," "building," "airplane,"  and "box" have very strange properties which we come to know without any experience. Nobody ever taught us that if a house is brown, that means its exterior is brown. There's an immense amount that we know about words that we were never taught. 


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Chase:</B> What does this mean? </FONT>


<P><B>Chomsky:</B> What you know can only come from two sources -- inside and outside. If it doesn't come from what's outside us, from our experience, it's got to come from our inner nature. Having a language is something like having arms, not wings. Or like undergoing puberty. These properties are not simply due to the nutritional environment of the embryo. 


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Chase:</B> You're saying it's part of our biological design.</FONT>


<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Yes. Contrary to what people thought, language is not taught, not even learned. It's something that your mind grows in a particular environment, just the way your body grows in a particular environment. Now your shape, how heavy you are, or the onset of puberty may vary depending on environment, nutritional level, etc. Normal physical development is always triggered by external phenomena, and also responds in some modified way to external phenomena. But its major properties are built in. And so is language. A child can't help acquiring it, though we can improve the way it's acquired as we can improve the way a child walks, marginally. Maybe it will walk two weeks earlier but it's going to walk, because it's a human.


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Chase:</B> What is the relationship to hearing, though? Because it's said that birds that are deaf do not learn to sing.</FONT>


<P><B>Chomsky:</B> A child who's deaf will not learn to speak. But it still has the language capacity and it will learn how to sign.


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Chase:</B> I've read that deaf babies make up their own sign system. </FONT>


<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Laura Pettito who was working in Cambridge and has been studying deaf children for many years, shows that deaf children go through early stages of acquisition of signing that parallel hearing children with speech. And Susan Golden-Meadow's work shows that children without any linguistic environment at all may nevertheless develop their own sign languages which have the basic properties of spoken language. That's the extreme case of deprivation of experience. So with zero experience, the system may still manifest itself in a particular way.


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Chase:</B> You've said that the everyday phenomena of language acquisition is just the growth of capacities stimulated by the environment. And the same is true of grammar?</FONT>


<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Yes. If I say, "He thinks that John is intelligent," you know that "he" is somebody other than John. If I say "his mother thinks John is intelligent," "his" may refer to John. Those are things we aren't taught. The basic features of language structure are built into our biological nature. They're like the principles that determine why mammals see things in a particular way and insects see things in a different way.


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Chase:</B> What are the big questions left to answer in linguistics?</FONT>


<P><B>Chomsky:</B> The traditional questions. The big one is what is it about you and me that distinguishes us from a rock or a bird?


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Chase:</B> The old question: What is man?</FONT>


<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Right. What are humans? One distinctive feature about humans is the language capacity. It's central for our present existence and it doesn't seem to have anything analogous or homologous to other organisms. It seems unique to the human species, it's essential and it's also uniform across the species. A sub-question of that is: what are the varieties of this characteristic. In what ways can human languages vary? Then there are questions about how these systems grow in the individual, how they are used when we express our thoughts, how they are realized in what we assume to be brain mechanisms. These are open questions. In principle there are questions about the evolution of these capacities. Whether those questions are realistic or not we do not know.


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Chase:</B> Like when did humans start to speak? </FONT>


<P><B>Chomsky:</B> In principle you can ask about the evolutionary history of any capacity. But the fact that you can ask a question doesn't mean it's answerable. Opinions differ. You can find people right on this campus who think it's a very answerable question. 


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Chase:</B> What do you think?</FONT>


<P><B>Chomsky:</B> I don't think we have a prayer of answering it on the basis of anything that's now understood. 


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Chase:</B> What is the connection between your interest in linguistics and your interest in politics?</FONT>


<P><B>Chomsky:</B> The connections are very abstract. But take what I said about our ability to use language and make judgements about things vastly beyond our experience. Well, the same logic applies in other areas. You and I are capable of making moral judgments that go vastly beyond any direct experience we have. We make moral judgments in new cases and we often know how to make them in quite intricate cases. You have a certain conception of how a society ought to be organized, you can see things that you don't like and you can change them. That must come from some concept of human beings and what's right for them. What needs they have, what rights they have and so on.


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Chase:</B> So certain ideas are innate.</FONT>


<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Here we are turning to speculation. Perhaps our nature  has at its core what has sometimes been called an instinct for freedom. If so, perhaps this has some relation to what is found in the study of human cognitive abilities, the possibility that at the core of your use of language is a certain striking and dramatic kind of freedom that was traditionally taken to be the basic difference between humans and machines.

<H1>Chomsky on Propaganda</H1>
<P>January, 1992 (?)
<P>Transcripts from a WBAI interview.<BR>
<I>(Contains some transcription errors.)</I>
</CENTER>

<P>... [T]his became a part of contemporary political science, the founder of the modern field of communications, one of the leading american political scientists, Harold Laswell he explained a couple of years after this in the early 1930's that should no succumb to what he called democratic dogmatisms about men being the best judges of their own interests, because they're not, they're not the best judges of their own interests, WE'RE the best judges of their interests and we have to therefore just out of ordinary morality make sure that they don't have an opportunity to opt to act on the basis of their misjudgements and the way we nowadays in whats nowadays called a totalitarian state/military state or something, it's easy you just hold a bludgeon over their heads and if they get out of line you just smash them over the head, but as societies become more free and democratic you lose that capacity and therefore you have to turn to the techniques of propaganda.

<P>The logic is clear -- propaganda is to a democracy what the bludgeon is to a totalitarian state and that's wise and good because again the common interests elude the bewildered herd, they cant figure them out. 
The public relations industry not only took this ideology on very explicitly but also acted on it, that's a huge industry, spending hundreds of..by now probably on the order of a billion dollars a year on it or something and its committment all along was to controlling the public mind. 

<P>In the 1930's big problems arose again as they had during the first world war. there was huge depression, there was substantial labor organizing, in fact in 1935 labor won its first major legislative victory, namely the right to organize with the wagner act, and that raised two serious problems for one thing democracy was misfunctioning the bewildered herd was actually winning legislative victories and it's not supposed to work that way, the other problem was it was becoming possible for people to organize and people have to be atomized and separated and alone.  

<P>They're not supposed to organize because then they might be able to actually exert some, they might be something beyond spectators of action they might actually be participants if many people with limited resources could get together to enter the political arena, that's really threatening and a major response was taken on the part of business to ensure that this would be the last legislative victory for labor and that it would be the beginning of the end of this democratic deviation of popular organization and in fact it worked that was the last legislative victory for labor and from that point on, although the no of people in the unions in fact increased for a while from the second world war it started dropping, the capacity to act through the unions began a steady drop. and it wasn't by accident.  

<P>We are now talking about the business community which spends lots and lots of money and attention and thought into how to deal with these problems through the public relations industry and other organizations like the National Association of Manufacturers and the Business Roundtable these days and so on. They set to work immediately to try to find a way to counter these democratic deviations, the first major effort, the first trial was a year later. In 1936 there was a major strike, the Bethlehem steel strike out in Western Pennsylvania, Johnstown, the mohawk valley and business tried out a new technique of destruction of labor which worked, worked very well, it was through propaganda.  

<P>Not through goon squads,breaking knees and all that kind of business which wasn't working very well anymore but through the more subtle and effective means of propaganda. The idea was to figure out ways to turn the public against the strikers, to present the strikers as disruptive, harmful to the public, against the common interests and the common interests are those of US, the businessman, the worker, the housewife and so on, that's all US, and we want to be just together, we want to have things like harmony, and Americanism and working together and so on and then theres those bad strikers out there who are kind of disruptive and causing trouble and breaking harmony and violating Americanism and we have to stop them so we can all live together, the corporate executive and the guy who cleans the floor who all have the same interests. we can all work together and work for Americanism in harmony, liking each other, that was essentially the message and a huge amount of effort was put into presenting it.  

<P>Recall after all this was the business community, so they control the media and have massive resources and so on. And it worked very effectively, in fact it was later called the mohawk valley formula applied over and over again to break that strike and these were called scientific methods of strike breaking and they worked very effectively. Mobilize community opinion in favor of vapid empty concepts like americanism - who can be against that? or harmony, who can be against that? Or to bring it upto date, Support our troops - who can be against that, or yellow ribbons - who can be against that? 

<P>Anything that's totally vacuous and diverts, after all what does it mean to be in favor of .. suppose somebody asks, do you support the people in Iowa, can you say I support them or no I don't support them.
It's not even a question it doesn't even mean anything.  And that's the point of public relations slogans like support our troops is that they don't mean anything, they mean as much as whether you support the people in Iowa.

<P>Of course there was an Issue -- the issue was do you support our policy but you don't want people to think about the issue that's the whole point of good propaganda, you want to create a slogan that nobody is gonna be against and I suppose everybody will be for because nobody knows what it means because it doesn't mean anything, but it's crucial value is it diverts your attention from a question that does mean something. Do you support our policy and that's the one you're not allowed to talk about.

<P>So you have people arguing about do I support the troops, of course I don't? etc and then you go on. That's like Americanism and harmony, we're all together, empty slogans that somehow join in and lets make sure we don't have all these bad people around who disrupt all of our harmony with their talk about class struggle and their rights and that sort of business.  Well, that's all very effective, it runs right up to today and of course it is carefully thought out. You know the people in the PR industry aren't there for the fun of it, they're doing work, they're trying to instill the right values, infact they have a conception of what a democracy ought to be, it ought to be a system in which the specialized class are trained to do their work for the service of the masters, the people who own the society, and the rest of the population ought to be deprived of any form of organization because organization just causes trouble. 

<P>They ought to be just sitting alone in front of the television set and having drilled into their heads daily the message which says the only value in life is to have more commodities, or to live like that rich middle class family you're watching and to have nice values like harmony and americanism and that's all there is in life. You may think in your own head that there's got to be something more in life than this but since you're watching the tube alone you assume I must be crazy because that's all that's is going on over there, and since there's no organization permitted, that's absolutely crucial, you never have a way of finding out whether you're crazy and you just assume it because it's the natural thing to assume. That's the ideal and great efforts were made into trying to achieve that ideal and there is a certain conception of democracy behind it.

<H1>Noam Chomsky On Capitalism</H1>

<P>David Finkel
<BR>The Detroit Metro Times

<P><TABLE WIDTH=66%><TR><TD><I>
Battling the New World Order -- Pushing aside media half-truths and U.S. government propaganda, Noam Chomsky's writings are an important source of information on American global policy.

<P>Chomsky's newest book, <A HREF="../dd/dd.html">Deterring Democracy</A>, is reviewed in a 700-word <A HREF="#sidebar">sidebar</A> which accompanies the interview.

<P>David Finkel is an editor of Against the Current magazine, and is a contributing writer for the Detroit Metro Times.

<P>A professor of linguistics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology since 1955, Noam Chomsky has contributed to a veritable revolution in linguistics theory. Chomsky, 62, has also been an outspoken critic of U.S. global policy, publishing numerous articles and more than 20 books on topics such as Palestine and Israel, U.S. involvement in Vietnam, East Timor, the ideology of terrorism and the chilling effects of monopoly media. Chomsky's writings have played an important role in American social change movements, providing information often unavailable from conventional sources. David Finkel recently spoke by telephone with Chomsky at his home outside of Boston.</I>
</TABLE>

</CENTER>


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>David Finkel: </B>Let's begin with the topic of the moment, the collapse of the Soviet Union: Is this a victory for the free market? Does it solve capitalism's problems, or create new ones?</FONT>

<P><B>Noam Chomsky: </B>To begin with, I think terms like "capitalism" and "socialism" have been so evacuated of any substantive meaning that I don't even like to use them. There's nothing remotely like capitalism in existence. To the extent there ever was, it had disappeared by the 1920s or '30s. Every industrial society is one form or another of <I>state</I> capitalism. But we'll use the term "capitalism," since that is more or less its present meaning.

<P>Well, what happened in the last 10-15 years is that capitalism underwent an enormous, murderously destructive catastrophe. There was a serious international crisis around 1980. Of the three major sectors of state capitalism -- the German-led European community, the Japan-based sector and the U.S.-based sector -- the German- and Japan-based sectors pulled out of the decline, but without regaining their previous rate of growth. The United States also pulled out, but in a very distorted fashion, with huge borrowing and very extensive state intervention....

<P>The rest of the world didn't pull out, especially in the Third World. There was a very serious crisis, amounting to catastrophe, in Africa, parts of Asia within the Western system and Latin America. That's what's called the crisis of the South, and it's a catastrophe of capitalism.

<P>Now in the Second World of the Soviet Union's dominance, there was also economic collapse... a stagnation of the command economy system, which has even less to do with socialism than our system has to do with capitalism. This was combined with nationalist pressures for independence and social pressures attacking the tyrannical system, which by the early 1980s turned into the crisis that has now become the collapse of the Soviet Union.

<P>All this had little to do with Western policy, but primarily with internal problems and also the general crisis of debt to the West. And there was a crisis of Soviet production, though again not as severe as in the Third World. This is a victory for the West in the Cold War, but that outcome was never seriously in doubt if you look at the relative economic and other forces.


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Finkel: </B>Explain a little more what you mean by state capitalism.</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky: </B>The victory of the West in the Cold War is combined with both this enormous catastrophe of capitalism, and with the move toward one kind or another of state-interventionist forms. As an example, the Reagan-Bush administrations are the most protectionist since World War II, doubling the percentage of imports subject to various forms of restriction.

<P>If you take a look at those Third World countries that pulled out of the crisis of 1980, it's the NICs [Newly Industrialized Countries] in the Japanese periphery. The comparison with Latin America is striking: Up to around 1980 they had similar patterns, then Latin America went into a free fall while the East Asian economies did well. That's because Latin America was opened up to international capital, while East Asia wasn't. You don't have capital flight from South Korea, because you get the death penalty for that. They not only discipline and terrorize the workers in the usual way, they regulate the capitalists, too. In general it's a move toward one end of the spectrum of state capitalism -- the fascist end -- that turned out to be effective in warding off the general crisis of the 1980s.


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Finkel: </B>How do you assess the Bush administration, especially in terms of domestic policies? Where does it continue the Reagan era and where is it a departure?</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky: </B>It's a continuation of the Carter-Reagan policies. Remember that the Reagan policies were proposed by Carter, who didn't have the muscle to push them through. Carter proposed essentially the military buildup that Reagan carried through, except that Reagan escalated it more rapidly in the beginning and leveled it off later.

<P>The Carter administration also proposed to attack welfare spending and the social support system for the poorer sectors, which the Reagan administration then carried through with bipartisan support. What these policies amounted to is turning the state, even more than before, into a welfare state for the rich: a much more interventionist state that pours public resources into high-technology industry and distributes resources away from the poor, combined with attacks on labor and civil rights.

<P>It's objectively a sound policy, I believe, for the privileged and powerful in an internationally complicated environment. They've internationalized capital to take advantage of cheap labor abroad, and intensified the class war that business has always waged against labor and the disadvantaged.

<P>The program of the Bush administration is largely non-existent in education, energy or the environment. There's rhetoric about the "education president" and whatnot, but policies remain the same, because nobody has figured out how to maintain high-tech industry without a state subsidy or without the Pentagon to provide a guaranteed market for its waste products.

<P>Since nobody has an alternative, this system will doubtless continue. The same applies to fiscal policies, which are driving the United States itself toward a country with a Third World look in infrastructure, services, the disgraceful state of health and mortality standards -- a two-tiered society with enormous wealth and privilege amidst poverty and suffering. It's not like Brazil, because it's a wealthier society -- but fundamentally of the same type, created with bipartisan agreement.

<P>The issues in presidential elections are virtually non-existent, as are the presidents. We went through the Reagan years with basically no president at all. He could barely read his lines. Bush is an executive, but in a very narrow sense. There is a lot of image creation --  the Great Communicator for Reagan, or for Bush it's the Master Statesman who manipulates international politics. It's a complete fake: The only thing he knows is how to beat up people who can't fight back.


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Finkel: </B>In your traveling since the disaster of the Gulf slaughter, what hopeful signs do you see in the grassroots movements?</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky: </B>For some time now, I've been going out of my way to go to the least organized, most reactionary places where I can get invited. During the Gulf war, I was talking in areas like Georgia, Appalachia and Northern California -- places that people who are organizing regard as hostile territory, and where during the war everybody was wearing fatigues.

<P>Yet I always find that people come out, and are interested. I think people are mainly cynical; they don't believe in anything. That can take the form of hysterical jingoism, but it's paper thin. Another form it takes is religious revivalism, which I think is on a scale in this country that's unique outside of places like Iran. Or it can take the form of immersion in something else, like football games.

<P>I listen to the sports talk shows when I drive. It's incredible: People have long, sophisticated arguments about what the New England Patriots should have done last Sunday. It reminds me of when I was 12 years old and I could tell you who was the quarterback for Texas Christian in 1937. A major radio station here in Boston just changed its format from 24-hour news to 24-hour sports.


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Finkel: </B>Do you think the Vietnam Syndrome is dead?</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky: </B>Not only don't I believe that, the administration doesn't believe it either. Somebody leaked to Maureen Dowd, who's basically a gossip columnist for the <CITE>New York Times,</CITE> a very important document -- the first international policy review of the Bush administration in its early months -- which she quoted in a column.

<P>It said that in confronting much weaker opponents we must defeat them rapidly and decisively. There cannot be classic intervention anymore -- U.S. soldiers slogging in Vietnam for years -- it must be either clandestine warfare as in Peru now, where not one American in a thousand knows there are U.S. troops, or the Panama-Iraq game, with enormous propaganda about the enemy ready to destroy us, then a quick victory without any fighting. There was no war, really, in the Gulf -- no fighting -- simply a slaughter, just as in Panama.

<H2>An Instinct For Freedom</H2>

<P><CITE><A HREF="../dd/dd.html">Deterring Democracy</A></CITE><BR>
Noam Chomsky<BR>
(Verso, 1991, 421 pp.) 

<P>The assumptions underlying Noam Chomsky's prolific writings on politics can be summed up like this:

<P>Human beings have the ability to understand their world as it really is, through observation and the application of common sense. The ability to understand is rooted in certain unique, innate structures of the human brain that allow us to reason and to speak. Chomsky believes that, although it cannot be proven at this stage of our knowledge, these innate mental structures also endow us with a desire for freedom, meaning a condition with the minimum of coercion imposed either by material necessity or by the rule of privileged minorities.

<P>It follows that where society is ruled by such a privileged elite, barriers must be created to prevent those outside from understanding reality and acting on it in their own interests. And so, especially in recent years, Chomsky's attention has turned to the proposition that our own society has developed the most sophisticated such barriers in the history of modern civilization.

<P>His newest work, <CITE>Deterring Democracy,</CITE> continues this theme, exploring the meanings of "democracy" in reality and in the thought-control system. In the real world, "a society is democratic," he writes, "to the extent that its citizens play a meaningful role in managing public affairs. If their thought is controlled, or their options are narrowly restricted, then evidently they are not playing a meaningful role: only the controllers, and those they serve, are doing so. The rest is a sham, formal motions without meaning.

<P>"Nevertheless, there has been a major current of intellectual opinion to the contrary, holding that thought control is essential precisely in societies that are more free and democratic, even when institutional means effectively restrict the options available in practice. Such ideas and their implementation are perhaps more advanced in the United States than anywhere else, a reflection of the fact that it is in important respects the most free society in the world."

<P>Chomsky identifies the "democracy" of the elites as the kind of system the United States imposes on Third World nations. In this "democracy," a passive population watches important decisions being made from above within the confines of a tight consensus of the privileged.

<P>The main body of the text carries this analysis into a discussion of the Cold War system, the war against Nicaragua's revolution, the early stages of the Gulf crisis (the book was completed on the eve of the war), the limits of permissible debate, democracy in the industrial societies and concluding reflections on possibilities for change.  [Note: the second edition of the book includes a <A HREF="../dd/dd-after-s01.html">post-war</A> review of events and coverage --JBE.]

<P>Readers who are new to Chomsky's work may want to start with <A HREF="../dd/dd-c07-s01.html">chapter 7</A>, "The Victors," a brutal indictment of "the fruits of victory" of the United States in the Cold War for the peoples of Latin America, the Caribbean, Asia and Africa. "It takes some discipline to avoid seeing these facts," Chomsky remarks, after summarizing the collapse of Third World economies under the load of debt, the systematic police murder of homeless children in Brazil, the reduction of Mexican agriculture to less than 10 percent of the land due to environmental destruction and other horrors.

<P>Those already familiar with this argument may wish to go directly to <A HREF="../dd/dd-c12-s01.html">chapter 12</A>, "Force and Opinion," where Chomsky explains in more-than-usual depth the roots of his own ideas in "seventeenth century thinkers who reacted to the skeptical crisis of the times by recognizing that there are no absolutely certain grounds for knowledge, but that we do, nevertheless, have ways to gain a reliable understanding of the world and to improve that understanding and apply it -- essentially the standpoint of the working scientist today."

<P>This is an old-fashioned view that contrasts strikingly with currently fashionable jargon of post-structuralism and post-rationalism, to say nothing of "the end of history." Pointing to "the courage and dedication of people struggling for freedom, their willingness to confront extreme state terror and violence" as the most hopeful evidence we have, Chomsky concedes: "Whether the instinct for freedom is real or not, we do not know, [but] ...as in the case of many of the natural beliefs that guide our lives, we can do no better than to choose according to our intuition and hopes...."

<H2>Counterpoint Interview</H2>

<P>November 1, 1991

<P><TABLE WIDTH=66%><TR><TD>
<I>This interview was broadcast originally on WNTR, NewsTalk Radio, Washington, DC on "The Middle East Hour" on Nov 1, 1991, hosted by Mark Bruzonsky Chairperson, Jewish Committee on the Middle East (JCOME) and Former Washington Representative, World Jewish Congress; guests were: Professor Noam Chomsky at MIT, Former Major General Matti Peled in Israel, Professor Riad Malki in Occupied Palestine, and Professor Hisham Ahmed from Grand Forks, North Dakota</I>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>JCOME:</B> Welcome to this first edition of the Middle East Hour sponsored by the Jewish Committee on the Middle East -- JCOME. Each week we will try to do something rather novel -- to bring you a tough, no-nonsense, hard-hitting and fast-paced discussion of what is really taking place in the Middle East and what the realities of American involvement with that crucial region really are. These realities are quite different and often at odds with how these matters are usually discussed here in this country. Indeed, that is why the Jewish Committee on the Middle East has decided to sponsor this program and to bring you what we consider a very honest and candid discussion of the realities of the situation. More about the Middle East Hour and more about the Jewish Committee on the Middle East as we proceed this hour.

<P>Today we have a unique lineup of Middle East experts for you. Professor Noam Chomsky is standing by at his office at M.I.T. Former Israeli General Matti Peled is in Jerusalem. Professor Riyad Malki, a Palestinian professor, is in the West Bank, and Professor Hisham Ahmed, a visiting professor, also from Palestine, is at the University of North Dakota.

<P>We couldn't have a better person to begin this discussion than Professor Noam Chomsky at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He is famous both as a linguist and a political analyst. He is a personal friend. And his perspective on these issues is always unique and penetrating. Noam, are you on line?</FONT>

<P><B>Noam Chomsky:</B> Yes, I am.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>JCOME:</B>We've just been through three very historic days, and I suspect you, like all of us, have been watching in awe what's been going on in Madrid. What are your thoughts as this conference comes to an end? And would you discuss your perspective on what American policies really are? Why did the United States bring this conference about in the first place?</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Well, I guess I must be one of the few who has not been watching in awe. Anyway, I haven't. I think that there are two parts to your question, as I understand it. One is whether the current American policies -- the policies of the Bush Administration --  are a new departure in any sense, or whether they simply continue U.S. Government policies towards the region.  The second is --  given that at least something is new; namely, there's a conference  -- why the efforts to have it now?

<P>Now, in my view, the policies of the U.S. Government insofar as they have any evidence about this (maybe something is going on in secret)...but insofar as there is any public evidence, the policies of the Bush Administration are basically those that the U.S. Government has been pursuing for about twenty years.

<P>In this respect, the United States has been in virtual diplomatic isolation. If you look at votes in the United Nations or other forums and so on, you find that it's the U.S. and Israel, essentially, against the world, and on two major issues: exactly the issues that come up annually at the United Nations and lead to votes of 144 to 2, as it was last December, and so on all the way back. One issue is whether there will be an internationally sponsored peace process. The United States has always been opposed to that. Every call for an international conference the United States has blocked, as last December in the 144 to 2 vote. And the reason for that is that the United States position is that this is U.S. turf. Nobody else is allowed to interfere. Henry Kissinger once put it privately (later declassified) that a major goal of his policy was to keep Europe and Japan out of diplomacy. Anybody with an independent voice must be kept out. Now in this current case, Gorbachev is permitted in. But that's because it is recognized that he is powerless and that the Soviet Union doesn't exist, and it will do anything the United States says. Therefore, they're allowed in. But apart from that, any independent force is not permitted. That's one reason why the U.S. has blocked the strong international effort for a peace process for many years; actually, twenty years.

<P>The second issue has to do with the form of the settlement. And on that the United States has been adamant that the Palestinians have no right of national self-determination. That has been the U.S. policy for many years. The U.S. has had to veto resolutions at the Security Council. It had to vote alone, or along with Israel, over and over at the General Assembly. It had to block other initiatives, always for the same reason. The U.S. position has been and remains that the Palestinians do not have a right of self-determination. But the Israeli client of the United States should have control over what it wants in the Occupied Territories.  And those remain the U.S.  positions as far as we know. They were made very explicit by James Baker, well before the Iraq War, in the early stage of the negotiations that led to these meetings -- in October and December, 1989, well before the war in the Gulf, at the time when the U.S.-P.L.O. dialogue was moving along supposedly unimpeded. At that time, the Baker Plan came out and Baker -- both in the plan and in his accompanying comments -- made it explicit and clear that the only proposal under discussion...his only effort was to move forward the implementation of what is called the Shamir Plan.

<P>Now, the Shamir Plan is actually a coalition plan of the two major Israeli parties. So it would be more accurate to call it the Shamir-Peres Plan -- the Likud-Labor Plan. And Baker stated openly that our only policy is to implement this plan. The Baker five points stated that, in accordance with the plan, some Palestinians might be admitted to negotiations if the U.S. and Israel approved of them. In other words, Palestinians could not choose their own representatives. His plan then stipulated that any Palestinians allowed to participate by the United States would be limited to discussing the modalities of implementation of the Shamir Plan.  They were not allowed to discuss any other issue.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>JCOME:</B>Well, Noam, what I hear you saying is that what we're witnessing today is really just a continuation of the step-by-step diplomacy that really goes back fifteen to twenty years to the Kissinger period. What is the United States trying to bring about? We've had three days of conference. Surely, there must be some goal.</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Yes, there is a goal. The old goal is, first, to ensure that the settlement is unilaterally determined by the United States without interference from anyone else...and that's what's happening in Madrid...and, secondly, to bring about the long-term goals that the U.S. has always favored. These goals are essentially the traditional position of the Israeli Labor Party, as stated in the Shamir-Peres plan, that Jordan is already a Palestinian state (so there is no issue of Palestinian self-determination), and that with regard to the occupied territories (the Gaza Strip and the West Bank)... Here there is a divergence within Israel between the two major parties, and the U.S. has typically tended toward the Labor position, and still does. That position is that Israel should essentially take what it wants from the occupied territories.  It should take control of the resources like the water. It should take the pleasant suburbs around a vastly expanded Jerusalem. It should take the usable land. But it should _not_ take responsibility for the bulk of the population. The bulk of the population in the West Bank should be under, preferably, Jordanian administration, or alternatively, under what's called "autonomy", meaning they can run local affairs, set tax rates, collect garbage and so on. But _not_ move toward self-determination.

<P>And that remains the U.S. position. In fact, it's built into the structure of the conference. Since the U.S. runs the conference unilaterally, it's been able to impose that potential settlement as its outcome.

<H1><FONT SIZE=5>Noam Chomsky on</FONT><BR>
An Unjust War</H1>

<P>V. K. Ramachandran
<BR><CITE>Frontline,</CITE> March 2-15, 1991


<P><TABLE WIDTH=66%><TR><TD>
January 15, 1991 ("deadline" day for George Bush), 7:30 p.m., lecture hall 10-250 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Students holding sacks at the entrance to the hall, in optimistic anticipation of donations to fund the work of the MIT Initiative for Peace in the Middle East (West Asia). The amphitheatre-like hall is packed with hundreds of people and is overflowing. A student activist, Amita Gupta, is at the microphone making campaign announcements. The announcements completed, the diminutive young organiser looks up at the gathered audience, pauses a moment, and says, "with no further ado, here's Noam."

<P>Applause -- cheering, clapping, foot-stomping -- fills the hall. Noam Chomsky, Institute Professor at MIT, pioneer in the field of linguistic science, social and political activist, commentator and theorist -- described once in _The New York Times_ as "arguably the most important intellectual alive" and on another occasion in the same paper as "perhaps the clearest voice of dissent in American history" -- steps up, unfazed, to the speaking-platform. As the applause fades away, he begins by admonishing the audience: this is not an occasion for cheering, he says, for we stand on the threshold of war.

<P>There are certain conspicuous features of a public political speech by Chomsky. The first is that there is an argument, precisely structured and dense with citation and factual detail. He does not speak from notes, even when he quotes. The presentation is characterised by a controlled passion, the rage showing through in the use of sledgehammer sarcasm, and there is no artifice or grandstanding in the style. I have heard him on Central America, on Palestine, on the elections in Nicaragua and on the crisis in the Gulf, and every time without fail, as I leave the MIT buildings, step into the night air, and descend the staircase to the bus stop on Massachusetts Avenue, I am full of the rage that Noam Chomsky's clear, rational voice of dissent has ignited.

<P>Chomsky's work in linguistics is not easily accessible to a layperson (and indeed, what follows in this paragraph is from a summary given to me by an Indian student of linguistics at the University of Chicago).  Chomsky was the first to propose, in the mid-1950s, a way of looking at language and cognition that was in radical contrast to the descriptivist and strictly behavioural approaches to language that were then dominant in the United States. In "Syntactic Structures," published in 1957, he first made explicit the idea of Generative Grammar as a formalised Cartesian way of characterising the grammar of a language. In this and in subsequent major works -- "Aspects of the Theory of Syntax" (1965), "Language and Mind" (1968), "Lectures on Government and Binding" (1981) and "Knowledge of Language" (1986), to name a few -- he has continued to develop the idea of a grammar as the explicit formulation, and one that has explanatory as well as descriptive power, of the knowledge of a language as acquired (rather than consciously learned) by a native speaker. The larger goal of his approach is to arrive at Universal Grammar, the innate system of principles and parameters that underlie any human language. Chomsky's work has, of course, significant inter-disciplinary implications: for study, for instance, in philosophy, cognitive psychology, neuropsychology and computer science.

<P>From the mid-1960s, Chomsky has been an important participant on the U.S. political scene. He is an analyst of socio-political events and trends and an activist, active particularly in the peace and Third World solidarity movements. Chomsky has worked on, among other fields, the Cold War and on U.S. policy in Vietnam, Central America and West Asia. He has written extensively on the role of business and Government elites and the "secular priesthood" -- principally journalists and academics -- in the construction of dominant ideologies, in manufacturing consent and generally in not telling people the truth. He has worked on conformity in U.S. intellectual life and on the role of the intellectual in public affairs. Chomsky has been a powerful influence on left-of-centre groups of different types in the United States and elsewhere, even on those who do not share his libertarian-socialist and anarchist views. In a recent scholarly paper, the political philosophers Joshua Cohen and Joel Rogers have attempted thus to characterise Chomsky's contribution to social thought:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Nothing that we know about human nature is inconsistent with the contention that aspirations to freedom and decency are fundamental features of that nature; and nothing that we know about social order defeats the hope that the pursuit of these aspirations will produce significant improvement in human circumstances. The fact that such hopefulness is consistent with the evidence enables children of the Enlightenment to be optimists of the will, without condemning themselves to be irrationalists of the intellect. It is C's insistence on this point, his commitment to both reason and moral hope, that we take to be his signal contribution to social thought.

<P>The interview that follows was conducted in Prof. Chomsky's office in Building 20 of the MIT. V.K. Ramachandran's was the first appointment in office of another very busy day; minutes after the interview was over, he was deep in discussion on linguistic theory with two graduate students.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Frontline:</B> Professor Chomsky, the United States administration has said that it had no alternative to waging war against Iraq -- that it had gone more than the extra mile for peace. Would you comment on this position?</FONT>

<P><B>Noam Chomsky:</B> Everyone expects governments to lie -- that is their business -- but this goes beyond reasonable limits. The fact is that the U.S. position on diplomacy has been clear, explicit and unwavering from the first minute, and it has been, as George Bush has repeatedly said, that there will be no negotiations. That's been the U.S. position from the start, that's been the U.S. position at the end. That was the U.S. position at the United Nations when it once again blocked a Third World effort: it refused even to allow the Security Council to hear a discussion about a ceasefire. The U.S. position all along has been: <I>there can be no diplomacy,</I> period. The U.S. position from August has been that we must narrow the options, from capitulation to the threat or use of force.

<P>How can the U.S. administration take this position and still claim that it is going the last mile for peace? Well, it relies on the deeply totalitarian character of Western culture. It assumes that in the U.S. and Britain and other subservient states, when the President says, "There will be no negotiations, we've gone the last mile for peace," every journalist and every intellectual will parrot -- will goose-step on command -- and say: "They've gone the last mile for peace," even though they have just said that there will be no negotiations.

<P>In fact there has been a series of negotiations options from August. All of this talk about whether the sanctions will work is highly misleading because there is very strong evidence that sanctions already had worked, probably by August and almost certainly by January. We know that from a series of proposals, including from Iraq, which have been released by high U.S. officials, so there is no reason to doubt their authenticity. I will not run through the whole record, but shall just take the most recent (at least that is public knowledge). In late December, Iraq made a peace proposal that was released by high U.S. officials on January 2. According to that proposal, they would withdraw totally from Kuwait -- totally, no border issues -- in return for Security Council arrangements on two outstanding issues: one, the Israel-Palestine issue, and the other, the issue of weapons of mass destruction in the region. A clarification the following day, which was actually published in the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> after an interview with Yasser Arafat, who had just returned from a discussion with Saddam Hussein, indicated that a mere <I>indication</I> by the Security Council of a willingness to deal with these two outstanding issues might suffice for a total Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait. State Department officials described this as what they call a "serious pre-negotiating position."

<P>Earlier offers had also been described as serious and negotiable: they were particularly interested in them because there was no mention of any of the outstanding border questions, the Rumillah oilfields and the islands in the Gulf. The U.S. did have a response to that. The response to that was George Bush's letter to Saddam Hussein, which said: "Principles cannot be compromised. Aggression cannot be rewarded. There will be no negotiations." That principles cannot be compromised is quite true -- you can't -- if you compromise, it is not a principle. But one thing that is obvious beyond discussion: the U.S. does <I>not</I> uphold the principle that aggressors cannot be rewarded. That's not even a joke. The U.S. constantly rewards aggressors; it is often an aggressor itself. George Bush is the one world leader who stands condemned before the World Court for the unlawful use of force, meaning aggression. Just last year he himself conducted the first post-Cold War act of aggression, the murderous invasion of Panama. And the U.S. has supported aggression throughout the world -- I mean, it's ridiculous.

<P>So it is true that principles cannot be compromised; but the principle that aggressors cannot be rewarded is not a U.S. principle. Its principle is the third sentence: "There will be no negotiations." In other words, we will not agree to a peaceful political settlement of this issue in return for a potential discussion of the Israel- Palestine question and the question of weapons of mass destruction. The U.S. rejection of diplomacy on those issues has perfectly <I>nothing</I> to do with Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, and we know that for certain because the U.S. was rejecting a diplomatic approach to those two issues before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.

<P>Last April, when Saddam Hussein was still George Bush's great friend and favourite trading partner, he offered the U.S. that he would destroy all of his non-conventional weapons, that is, all of his biological and chemical weapons (there are no nuclear weapons). That offer came to the White House, and since Iraq was still a friend at that time, there was an excellent official response. The official response was: we welcome Saddam Hussein's offer to destroy all of his arsenals -- that's fine -- but we do not want this linked to other issues or weapons systems. Now that is an oblique way of saying "we want Israel to keep its nuclear weapons." In other words, there cannot be a <I>regional</I> disarmament proposal, because the U.S. wants Israel to maintain its several hundred nuclear weapons with which it can intimidate the region. And because of that the U.S. refuses a diplomatic approach to this issue.

<P>Notice that they do not <I>mention</I> Israeli nuclear weapons. No U.S. official can mention Israeli nuclear weapons, for a very simple reason. If they <I>concede</I> what everyone <I>knows</I> -- that Israel has nuclear weapons -- then all U.S. aid to Israel becomes illegal (as it has been illegal under U.S. law since 1977, when laws were passed barring any aid to countries developing nuclear weapons). So that is the first issue -- the U.S. does not want a diplomatic settlement of the problem of weapons of mass destruction, because it wants Israel to maintain an overwhelmingly intimidating posture with nuclear weapons.

<P>On the second issue, the Israel-Palestinian conflict, for 20 years the U.S. has been opposing a diplomatic settlement of that. It has <I>nothing</I> to do with Iraq and Kuwait. The last vote in the United Nations on this was in December 1989, well before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. You cannot have a vote at the Security Council, because the U.S. just vetoes it. But at the General Assembly, where you cannot veto, there was a vote. And the vote called for an international conference on the Israel-Palestinian problem and a settlement of that problem in terms -- and here they quoted -- of U.S. Resolution 242 on territorial guarantees and security. They opposed the acquisition of territory by force and they added that the solution must take into account the legitimate rights of the Palestinians. It did not mention the Palestinian state, but that is more or less implied.

<P>The vote on that was 151 to three. The three were the United States, Israel and Dominica (which was probably sleeping that day). The 151 included all the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) allies and all the Arab states -- in fact it included everyone who did not happen to have a flu on that day. That is the way that it has been for 20 years -- the U.S. and Israel are totally isolated on this. Naturally, the U.S. opposes an international conference: it knows that if you pick anyone for the international conference outside of the U.S. and Israel, they will press for a diplomatic settlement, which the U.S. does not want. This has <I>nothing</I> to do with linkage. It has <I>nothing</I> to do with Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. It has to do with the U.S. opposition to diplomatic settlement.

<P>There are three issues here, and the U.S. is opposed to a diplomatic settlement of each one of them, and therefore it is opposed to linkage. It does not want a diplomatic settlement of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait (which could have been attained, it appears). It does <I>not</I> want a diplomatic settlement of the problem of weapons of mass destruction. It does not want a diplomatic settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Accordingly, it is opposed to linkage, that is, to diplomacy that brings these issues together. It's as simple as that.

<P>The extremism of the U.S.-British view on this -- Britain tails along like a loyal puppy dog on this topic -- was reviewed quite dramatically on January 14. It is worth looking closely at what happened there, it is very enlightening. On the evening of January 14, which was right before the deadline, France introduced a proposal at the U.S. Security Council calling for a total and immediate Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait -- <I>total,</I> no conditions -- in return for which the Security Council would say that at some appropriate moment in the future -- which was unspecified -- it <I>might</I> be useful to have an international conference on regional issues. There's an almost totally meaningless gesture -- it said <I>nothing.</I> The U.S. and England at once announced that they would veto any such statement. That takes radical extremism to <I>unimaginable</I> limits. They wanted to go to war in preference to having a complete settlement with the condition that <I>maybe</I> later they would talk about regional issues. Now whether that would have worked or not nobody knows, because the U.S. at once vetoed it. In my view France proposed it only because they knew it was going to be vetoed. I think it was a totally cynical thing -- everyone knew that the U.S. would never permit it.

<P>If you look more closely, it is even more revealing. The wording of the French proposal -- that the members of the Security Council believe that at an appropriate moment an international conference might be useful -- was actually drawn from a Security Council statement of December 20.


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Frontline:</B> Of 1990?</FONT>


<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Yes. 1990, just a few weeks earlier. On December 20 the U.S. Security Council passed Resolution 681 (I think it was) which had nothing to do with Iraq at all. It had to do with Israeli human rights abuses, deportations and so on, and it called upon Israel to observe the Geneva Conventions. The Security Council tried to introduce into that resolution the wording that I just quoted, that at some appropriate moment in the future an international conference might be useful. The U.S. said that it would veto the resolution if that wording was included in it, and the wording was added as a codicil to the resolution. So it's not <I>technically</I> in the resolution, but after the resolution is a statement that members of the Security Council believe that at an appropriate moment an international conference might be helpful in bringing peace to the region. That had nothing to do with linkage. Iraq was never mentioned in that resolution. It is just the passionate U.S. refusal to accept the possibility -- even hint at the possibility -- of a diplomatic settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict. And when France, introducing the wording of the codicil into the resolution, tried to put forward the proposal of January 14, the U.S. and Britain instantly announced that they would veto it.

<P>That reveals an opposition to diplomacy that is really passionate, and it will surprise no one whose eyes are open. For the past 20 or 25 years the U.S. and Britain have been in a virtual war against international law at the United Nations. If you take a look at the record of the United Nations, that is very clear. In the Security Council since 1970, fully 80 per cent of the vetoes are by the U.S. and Britain, with the U.S. in the lead. In third place is France, and in fourth place, far behind, is the Soviet Union. It has fewer than one-third as many vetoes as England and about one-seventh as many vetoes as the U.S. That is not too surprising. After all, these are the two imperial states, and they are therefore naturally opposed to international law. International law is a very weak barrier against the depredations of the powerful, and naturally the powerful are against it. You have to be willfully blind not to see these things.

<P>I should say that there is a good deal of lying about it in the press. For example, there are just hundreds of articles in the press that talk about the wondrous change at the United Nations, that finally it is acting in its peacekeeping function and that it is no longer blocked by Russian obstructionism and Third World hysterics. The fact is that the United Nations has been blocked overwhelmingly by British-American obstructionism, not by the Russians. Back in the early days, when the United Nations was an instrument of U.S. policy, the Russians were vetoing everything. That stopped in the 1960s. Since the U.N. fell out of control of the United States, the U.S. has been trying to destroy it.

<P>The worst deceit in this comes from the academic profession -- people like Professor Adam Roberts at Oxford who is the great British expert on the United Nations. Read his articles in <CITE>The Independent</CITE> (of London) on this. He is the main British specialist on this topic, so when he does it, it is not just ignorance, it is conscious deceit. In his very scholarly article in <CITE>The Independent</CITE> on this topic he gives the cumulative record of all vetoes since 1946. If you give that cumulative record, it looks like the Russians are vetoing everything, because they did in the early years. Giving that cumulative record and not breaking it down, he then concludes that the Cold War is over and that now the United Nations can function. He knows perfectly well that those Russian vetoes are in the 1940s and 1950s and that the vetoes in the last 20 years are by the U.S. and Britain. But as a loyal commissar he doesn't say that, and he makes it appear as if somehow the Russians have been blocking everything.

<P>This combination of deceit and ignorance has allowed the U.S. to get away with claiming that it is pursuing diplomacy while it is clearly -- and quite passionately -- blocking diplomacy, as it has been doing for a long time.


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Frontline:</B> Do you think that sanctions were beginning to take effect, that they were an effective method?</FONT>


<P><B>Chomsky:</B> It was quite obvious in August that sanctions would be unusually effective in this case. There are two very clear reasons for that. For one thing, the sanctions were of absolutely unprecedented severity. There has <I>never</I> been a case in the past when sanctions were imposed on food, even in much worse cases of aggression and atrocities than this one, and there are many worse cases. Secondly, the sanctions this time were going to hold. Remember: sanctions usually do not work because they are violated, and they are usually violated by the U.S., England and France and their allies. Sanctions against the racist states of southern Africa were very porous because imperial countries like the U.S., England and France violated constantly. Hence they were very weak. In this case, however, the usual violators of sanction supported them and therefore they were going to hold.

<P>The discussion about whether sanctions <I>would</I> work is more or less irrelevant, because there is very strong evidence that they already <I>had</I> worked. At least, I find no other plausible explanation for the series of Iraqi peace proposals that were released by U.S. officials from late August right through early January.

<P>The U.S. and Britain, remember, moved as quickly as they could to <I>undercut</I> sanctions -- they did not want sanctions to work. Very quickly, within a few days, they announced that they were going to send an expeditionary force to the desert. Now a <I>deterrent</I> force could be kept in place while sanctions took effect. An <I>expeditionary</I> force -- a big expeditionary force, hundreds of thousands of troops -- cannot be kept there for more than a few weeks, or maybe a few months at the most. It is just too expensive and it is generally impossible. They were telling the world: "We're going to undercut sanctions, we don't want sanctions to work."

<P>That was combined with the explicit statement that there would be no negotiations. Remember, sanctions mean sanctions and negotiations. The peaceful means prescribed by international law are sanctions along with diplomacy to arrange for withdrawal under the pressure of sanctions, and that is what the two warrior-states did not want.

<P>In other cases, the question whether sanctions would have worked in five months is ridiculous. Let us take the case of Namibia. The U.N. declared the South African occupation of Namibia illegal back in the 1960s. The World Court declared it illegal in, I think, 1970 or 1971. Sanctions were imposed, but they were very weak, and they were constantly broken by the U.S., Britain and France primarily, but by others as well. Meanwhile, 20 years went on, 20 years of what was called "quiet diplomacy" and "constructive engagement." Nobody proposed bombing Cape Town. Nobody proposed putting a huge expeditionary force to invade South Africa.

<P>And it is not that what was happening in Namibia was very pretty. They were robbing the place, they were looting it, they were terrorising it, they were using it as a base for attack against other countries. <I>The toll was awesome.</I> According to the U.N. Economic Commission on Africa, in the last ten years alone the cost to the <I>neighbors</I> -- forget Namibia and South Africa -- was over $60 billions and over a million lives were lost. You know that nobody's heart was broken about the suffering of the poor Africans. No one proposed stopping food. In fact, very few people even proposed living up to the very weak sanctions that were imposed. Nobody proposed bombing Cape Town. Nobody asked: "How long can we wait while the sanctions work?" I mean, this is pure hypocrisy -- pure and total hypocrisy. Serious people shouldn't even talk about it.


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Frontline:</B> The report of the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War said medical sanctions had in fact begun to take effect, and disastrously so, even in December.</FONT>


<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Of course, there is just no doubt. These sanctions are so severe that, to their credit, the National Council of Churches immediately condemned them as unconscionable. I think they are right, it is just unheard of. Quite apart from that, it is crucial to recognise that these sanctions were <I>observed.</I> The countries that usually violate sanctions, the countries that despise international law -- like the U.S., England and France -- were observing them this time. Apparently they had worked. Why else would Iraq have come across with these proposals?


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Frontline:</B> In the light of U.S. policy in West Asia, of what does Bush's New World Order consist? What message is he sending the world regarding its content?</FONT>


<P><B>Chomsky:</B> He is sending the world a very clear message. The message is: the world is to be ruled by force. Not diplomacy, not economic power, but force. There is an obvious reason why he wants that. You simply take a look at the structure of the New World Order, which has been coming into existence for the last 20 years and has several dramatic features.

<P>By the 1950s, England, which used to be the imperial power, was a power very much in decline. It had a very troubled economy: about all that it had left was a big military force and a martial tradition, and that remains the case. The U.S. is pretty much in the same position, although on a much grander scale. By the 1970s the U.S. was losing its economic dominance over the world. It was still the world's biggest economy; in fact, as of today it is still the world's biggest economy. But it is visibly declining in the past 20 years as compared with its major rivals, namely Germany-led Europe and Japan. Economically, you have what is nowadays called the tripolar world.

<P>The Reagan-Bush administrations have administered a very severe blow to the American economy. The costs have yet to be paid, but they are real. There is huge debt, the financial institutions are tottering, the infrastructure is collapsing, and the U.S. economy is in severe trouble. It is a rich country, with enormous resources, but the Reagan and Bush administrations basically threw a party for the rich, at the cost of future generations and the poor. The State of the Union message, you will notice, said virtually nothing about the U.S. economy, because they have no way of resurrecting the U.S. economy. that is one feature of the New World Order.

<P>A second feature of this New World Order was also visible by the 1970s, and it was that the Soviet Union was in bad trouble. The Soviet Union's military expenses began to level off in the 1970s -- quite the opposite of what we were being told, but those were lies for other reasons -- and it was clear that there was stagnation and serious internal problems. By the early 1980s, the Soviet Union was essentially collapsing and by now it has more or less withdrawn from the world. It is doubtful whether it will even hang together as an organised entity. So the disappearance of the Soviet Union from the world scene is the second feature of the New World Order, and that has consequences.

<P>One consequence is that western Europe and the U.S. have now achieved a long-term objective, that they have been fighting for since 1917, and that is to return eastern Europe to its traditional status as Third World. Before 1917, eastern Europe was, for the most part, a quasi-colonial dependency of the West, with usual Third World functions -- cheap labour, resources, and investment opportunities. The Soviet Union cut that region off from Western exploitation, which is one of the fundamental reasons for the Cold War and for the hostility towards the Soviet Union. Now that is over, and the West can expect to return this region to the status of Mexico and Brazil and others, which is what they have long wanted to do.

<P>Of course Germany is well in the lead on this one and Japan will get in the act when they decide that it is worthwhile. The U.S. is going to have a much harder time, because of its economic decline and its capital deficits.

<P>Another consequence of the Soviet withdrawal from the scene is that the Soviet Union had a big military force: although it was not much of an economic power, as a military force it <I>deterred</I> the U.S. Now, in Western ideology and propaganda, the U.S. deterred and contained the Soviet Union, but in the real world it was the other way around -- the Soviet Union deterred and contained the U.S. The U.S. is a global power; it is carrying out intervention all through the world in areas where it does not have a conventional force advantage.

<P>That can be dangerous. There was always a limit on the use of force by the U.S. because there was always the fear that it might turn into a superpower confrontation, which would be extremely dangerous, and that imposed limits on the use of U.S. power. So in Indochina, in the Middle East (West Asia) and, in fact, every part of the world, there was a deterrent effect of Soviet power. Furthermore, the Soviet Union provided some degree of support to targets of U.S. attack, which made it harder to destroy them. Now that is all gone, and for the last several years, U.S. strategists have been generally exulting over the fact that they are no longer deterred by Soviet power.

<P>Again, Western intellectuals who are deeply subservient to state power are not permitted to see these fact, but they are trivial and any ten-year-old can understand them. The U.S. is now much more free to use force than it has been in the past. We see that in the Middle East: 10 to 15 years ago, the U.S. and Britain, the two warrior- states, would not have been able to put large conventional forces in the region because it would just be dangerous. A Middle East confrontation could lead to a confrontation with the Russians and the forces would simply be exposed to destruction. Nowadays they do not have to worry. There is no deterrent: they can do anything they like. This is said quite openly by the U.S. strategists, I should say, and has been for several years. I can give you examples if you like.

<P>To put this together, what do we have? We have a New World Order, in which the strength of the U.S. is certainly not diplomacy. The policies that it is pursuing are extremely unpopular. In the region, say from Morocco to Indonesia, popular support for U.S.- British policies is extremely low, to put it mildly. They get support from family dictatorships and so on but certainly not from the general population. The same is true in Latin America and Africa and elsewhere -- the U.S. and British policies are not popular and therefore diplomacy is ruled out. That is why the U.S. and, following it, Britain, are almost always opposed to diplomacy and try to undermine it.

<P>Economic power <I>used</I> to be the strength of the U.S., but that is less and less the case. By now that is not the strong card -- others have economic power. What is left is force -- the U.S. has a virtual monopoly of force and no deterrent. At a much lower scale, the same is true for Britain. The British right-wing press is quite perceptive on this topic. It points out that Britain cannot compete economically with Germany and Japan: in fact, it can barely compete with Italy. But when it comes to what they call "national character," Britain reigns supreme. That is a way of saying that Britain has several centuries of experience in smashing the natives in the face, and it know how to do that. It has the martial spirit, and therefore, its sturdy national character still ranks supreme, not like these cowardly Germans and Japanese, who just make money. That is the right-wing variant, and it is basically correct -- that Britain hopes to kind of recover its feelings of imperial glory by trailing along after the big guys across the ocean.

<P>For the U.S., its comparative advantage in the world is essentially its monopoly of force, and therefore the natural posture for it to adopt is that of a mercenary state. Somebody has got to control and subdue the Third World -- the industrial countries understand that -- you have to keep them under control, you have to block independent nationalism, you have to make sure they are readily exploitable. However, they no longer have the economic base for it. Therefore they have to be a mercenary.

<P>The U.S. is becoming a mercenary state. It carries out the military interventions -- it has the force -- and others are supposed to pay for it. Well, who is going to pay for it? Germany and Japan want the services, but they do not want to pay for it. They have no particular interest in propping up the economies of their rivals, the U.S. and England. They will grudgingly give a little bit of support to the mercenaries, but not much.

<P>There is only one other major source of capital in the world, besides Germany and Japan, and that is petrodollars. The way the New World Order is shaping up you have to block diplomacy, and you have to block reliance on economic power, because the U.S. is not ruling now. You have to shift confrontation to the arena of force, where the U.S. reigns supreme. You need a world ruled by force, and somebody has got to pay for it. The primary source has to be oil production, the colossal profits from energy.

<P>This policy, incidentally, was pretty explicit in the 1950s and you can actually read it in the declassified secret documents of both Britain and the U.S. in the 1950s. Now it is much broader.

<P>Again disciplined intellectuals do not look at these questions, because they are just much too revealing, they tell you too much about the truth. But for anyone who wants to understand what is going on in the Gulf today the first thing to look at is the declassified record of secret documents of Britain and the U.S. in the 1950s. They are now more or less open. There has been a lot of censorship but there are a lot of them that are available and they are very clear. The crucial point to look at is 1958, when there was a nationalist officers revolution in Iraq. That was the first break in the Anglo- American condominium over oil production and naturally there was great fury in England and the U.S. We know what they did publicly. The U.S. sent the Marines to Lebanon the next day and Eisenhower authorised the use of any weapons whatsoever -- meaning nuclear weapons -- if anyone moved into Kuwait, that is, if the nationalist revolution spread to Kuwait. Secretly, now revealed, British Foreign Secretary Selwyn Lloyd flew to Washington for consultations and the British and the Americans decided at that point to give Kuwait a kind of nominal independence in order to deter the threat of a nationalist uprising there. They followed the principles that were outlined by Lord Curzon and others back in the 1920s, namely to "rule behind an Arab facade," quoting Lord Curzon, and to disguise absorption behind constitutional fictions like "buffer state" or "sphere of influence." That is traditional British policy -- it is much more cost-effective and cheap to rule behind an Arab facade and to disguise domination and absorption by fictions than it is to exercise direct rule. That was the policy decided on for Kuwait.

<P>Britain and the U.S. reserved the right to intervene -- or, as the British Foreign Secretary put it secretly, ruthlessly to intervene -- in case anything went wrong. The U.S. reserved the same right elsewhere in the region. The National Security Council has a memorandum calling for the use of force if necessary to ensure that British-American interests in the region are protected. They were also explicit about those interests, and it is revealing. The interests, with regard to Kuwait, were that the profits from Kuwaiti oil be used to prop up the sterling. The British economy was ailing, it was a weak economy, and at that time it very badly needed both the oil and the profits from Kuwaiti investments in order to meet its liabilities. So the imperial arrangement had to be that the profits from oil production not be used for the Arab peoples -- of course, they could be used for the family dictatorships, so far as it did not amount to much -- but mainly go to the West, primarily to England and later to the U.S. Well, that is what is going on.

<P>By the 1970s, the U.S. also was beginning to be in a degree of trouble: it was following England, many decades behind, and it needed this capital resource. In fact, that is one of the reasons why the U.S. and England actually were pretty much supportive of the oil price rise in the early 1970s. It actually benefited their economies. The international business press was quite open about it at the time. These are two high-cost oil producers -- North Sea and Alaska are high- cost oil -- and they could be brought into production profitably when the prices went high enough. That continues to be the case. Capital resources from the Gulf oil producers by now are a very substantial contribution to the two ailing economies. Britain and the U.S. to their Treasury securities, financial institutions and so on. There is a joke going around Wall Street now that more or less captures the story, and it goes like this. Question: Why do Kuwait and the United States need each other? Answer: Kuwait is a banking system without a country and the United States is a country without a banking system. Like a lot of jokes, it is not a joke. The Savings and Loan crisis is probably going to run over a trillion dollars (Savings and Loans institutions in the U.S. lend money to local people to buy homes). The banks are beginning to go, and that is a much more serious business. The biggest bank in New England just collapsed a few weeks ago, and others are tottering. They need capital and the only place they are going to get it is from the oil producers: there is no other source of capital that is going to prop up the U.S. economy. It is a debtor economy, the deficit is growing. George Bush and the planners haven't an idea in their heads about how to deal with the domestic economic problem -- you could see that from the State of the Union message.

<P>That's the New World Order.


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Frontline:</B> Saddam Hussein is a relatively new entrant into U.S. administration demonology. Would you comment on this rapid transition from "moderate" to his present standing?</FONT>


<P><B>Chomsky:</B> If you know U.S. history, this is just playing an old record. Let us just go back to 1917: in the First World War the U.S. became some kind of global power instead of just a regional power. The first relevant event was Mussolini's march on Rome and the institution of fascism in Italy. That was very much applauded in the U.S., they thought it was wonderful. Mussolini was a "moderate." He was destroying the unions, he was breaking up parliamentary democracy. The U.S. regarded Italy as more or less a Third World country, on the border between the first and the Third World. The idea was that Italians, like all Third World people, liked discipline and authority. So when strong, disciplined leader comes in, they are happy -- it makes the wops happy, is the way they put it. Mussolini was wonderful: the liberals loved him and the Republicans thought he was marvelous. The labour unions thought he was great -- he was breaking strikes, he was destroying class struggle and getting rid of the Bolsheviks. They described him as a "moderate" standing between the extremists of Right and Left. (The extremists of the Left are socialists and labour leaders and so on and the extremists of the Right are some sort of fanatics who want to kill everybody instead of just instituting fascism). So he was a moderate.

<P>He stayed a moderate: Roosevelt called him that "admirable Italian gentleman" and that continued right through the 1930s. When he attacked France, of course, that was too much. Then he became the devil and remained the devil until the U.S. liberated Italy.

<P>Hitler was described as a moderate, standing between the extremists of the Left and the Right. They approved of him: when he opposed U.S. interests too much, he became the devil.

<P>That is the constant pattern and in the Third World, it happens over and over again. In the Dominican Republic, Trujillo remained a moderate for about 30 years. He massacred people, he killed 20,000 Haitian workers in 1936, he tortured, destroyed -- he was a moderate, we loved him. Then, by the 1950s, he began to get a little too big for his breeches. He started to interfere with U.S. business interests. He was buying up too much of the country for himself, not realising that it really had to be owned by U.S. corporations. He became a devil and had to be destroyed, so we had to try to assassinate him. Marcos, dictator in the Philippines, was a moderate: we supported him up until the time when the army turned against him. Then all of a sudden he became a devil and we had to kick him out. We can go on and on: Duvalier, Somoza -- every gangster in the Third World is fine as long as they are working for us.

<P>But typically, these people get out of hand. The most recent one was Noriega. Noriega was a very minor killer and thug is comparison with these others, but he was bad enough: he was running drugs, he was killing opponents, he was stealing elections. That was all fine, he was just wonderful, the U.S. backed him, he was on the CIA (Central Intelligence Agency) payroll. Then he got out of hand. The worst thing that he did was to support the Contradora treaty, the peace efforts of the Latin American democracies. As always, the U.S. was strongly opposed to diplomacy in Central America, and when Noriega began to back that, he was already in trouble. He also was not helping enough in the war against Nicaragua, so he had to be destroyed. He became the next monster.

<P>The same happened with Saddam Hussein: it is replaying the old record. Up until August 1, though he was a murderous killer, he could institute maybe the worst tyranny in the world, torture dissidents, gas the Kurds. He could do anything he felt like, he was still an admirable Iraqi gentleman, he was a moderate whose behaviour was improving. The U.S. became his largest trading partner, gave him enormous credits (in fact, second only to Mexico in agricultural credits), he was good for business, he was just fine. The U.S. even virtually told him right on the eve of the invasion that if he were to rectify border issues by force it would not object. (That was essentially the meaning of the diplomatic contacts right on the even of the invasion.) But he went too far. He showed that he was an independent nationalist and he crossed U.S. interests. The U.S. simply invoked its traditional policy, that is, ruthlessly to intervene if anything goes wrong. Then he became a devil and he had to be destroyed.

<P>This is a standard pattern. You support any gangster you like, but if they turn against you, they become reincarnations of Genghis Khan and then you can use their monstrous record of atrocities as a weapon against them. Let us take Suharto in Indonesia. He puts all of these people, including Saddam Hussein, to shame: they look Boy Scouts compared to Suharto. Here is a man who came into power with the massacre of about 700,000 people, <I>strongly</I> supported by the U.S. The U.S. was absolutely enthusiastic about it, and if you read the <CITE>New York Times,</CITE> it was called the "gleam of light in Asia," "hope where there was none." He killed off about maybe half a million or a million people, mostly landless peasants, wiped out the only mass political party in the country -- how would you be against him? You have to applaud -- that's fantastic.

<P>People in India do not have to be told that Western hypocrisy is just unparalleled. This transition from moderate to monster is absolutely standard, it happens all the time, and it takes disciplined Western intellectual not to see it.


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Frontline:</B> As a person who is also concerned with the vocabulary of U.S. politics, how do you view Bush's characterisation of the war that the U.S. administration and military machine are waging as a "just" war?</FONT>


<P><B>Chomsky:</B> When Joshua conquered the land of Canaan and tried to murder every living person, it was described as a just war. If we had the records, we would probably find that the Mongol invasions were justified as just wars.

<P>When Saddam Hussein sends Scud missiles to Israel he says it is a just war. He parrots George Bush word by word, and his arguments are just as good as Bush's. It takes disciplined intellectuals not to see this triviality.

<P>Here is what Saddam Hussein says when he talks about sending Scud missiles to Israel: my heart is torn by the sufferings of the Palestinians; I can't stand it. I can't sleep at night thinking about their suffering. Israel has annexed the Syrian Golan Heights over the unanimous condemnation of the Security Council, a terrible violation of international law. They have attacked Lebanon, killed 20,000 people. They still hold southern Lebanon, right now, there are Israeli rockets hitting Lebanon. He says: how can I stand this? I am such a great lover of international law and human rights, my heart is breaking. I have waited for sanctions, but you cannot have sanctions, because the U.S. vetoes them. I have tried diplomacy, but you cannot have diplomacy, because the U.S. vetoes it. I have waited not five months, but years and years, my heart breaking over these atrocities. What can I do, I have to use force. Well, that is George Bush, except that it is a stronger argument.

<P>So it is a just war. Yes, of course.


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Frontline:</B> In what direction do you see the war proceeding now?</FONT>


<P><B>Chomsky:</B> If the U.S. could simply follow military strategy -- if there were no considerations beyond military considerations -- they would just continue to bomb. Bomb the supply lines and bomb the troops, and ultimately they will be destroyed. However, there are two big problems. One is financial. The U.S. and Britain cannot pay for it and they cannot have a long war for simple financial reasons. The other reason, in my view more significant, is political. George Bush can stand up and say "World against Saddam Hussein!" but his advisers know perfectly well that if you count noses, it is more like the world against George Bush, especially if you count noses in the relevant regions, from Morocco to Indonesia. (You will notice that the U.S.- British military effort is called the "allies" here -- that is war propaganda, an attempt to try to bring with it the favourable connotations of the war against the Nazis. In fact, it is the U.S. and Britain, two radical militarist states, not the "allies.")

<P>The British and the Americans have support from the family dictatorships that they set up as an Arab facade to run the Gulf for them. There is weak support elsewhere, very weak. Egypt is marginally supporting it, and Turkey marginally supporting, but even in these countries they cannot keep their populations under control. In Egypt it has reached the point where schools and universities are closed and they have even cancelled sporting events, because they are afraid to let people get together in the street. In Morocco, which technically is supporting the war, there was a pro-Iraqi general strike a few days ago and the Government was forced to endorse it. In Pakistan, according to the British, about 80 per cent of the population not only opposes the U.S.-British effort, but actually supports Saddam Hussein. Indonesia has not condemned the Iraqi invasion because they are afraid of their own population. The whole region is in a ferment and the longer the war goes on, the more danger there is that even the dictatorships are not going to be able to control their own populations. In particular, if the war goes on long enough to get into Ramadan or, worse than that, into the Hajj, then they are in deep trouble It is very unlikely that Saudi Arabia can permit the Hajj, because if they allow Muslims into Saudi Arabia, they are going to tear the country to pieces. They can control their own population, but they are not going to be able to control millions of pilgrims from the rest of the world. If they have to <I>cancel</I> the Hajj, that could be just disastrous for the Saudi Arabian elite. They are supposed to be the protectors of the holy places. They are getting into a real bind on that one.

<P>The war has to be over, well over, before these events occur. For that reason, the U.S. is not going to be able to be guided by military strategy alone. It is going to be forced to do something to try to win fast, for political reasons and for economic reasons. I suspect that that means they will move to a ground offensive before military strategy would dictate that it is the right thing to do. At that point, nobody knows what is going to happen, least of all the generals, who never know anything and certainly do not know anything now. It is possible that when the U.S. and British forces undertake a ground offensive, they will really be walking into a meat-grinder. The U.S. and Britain are not willing to take casualties; they are willing to kill plenty of other people, but they do not like to take casualties themselves. If they start to take casualties, there is only one way they can react, and that is by sharply escalating the level of weaponry, and that could be very, very ugly.


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Frontline:</B> Do you think that the U.S. administration will actually consider the use of nuclear weapons?</FONT>


<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Yeah, sure. If the U.S. begins to take heavy casualties, they will probably move right on to nuclear weapons.


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Frontline:</B> Independent of whether or not Saddam Hussein presses the chemical button?</FONT>


<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Has this ever deterred the West in the past? I mean let's be serious -- we're talking about the West, the most savage civilisation in world history. They do what they feel like.

<P>Just look at the history of Iraq, and that will tell you. I do not know how many people in India know this history -- again, this is suppressed by Western intellectuals -- but the records are there. Britain took over Iraq at the time of the First World War. Britain was in a weakened state at that time. It did not have enough troops to hold down the empire and therefore it got much more violent. That is when the Amritsar massacre took place, for example. In Iraq they did not have ground forces, so what did they do? They turned to terror-bombing, the first time that terror-bombing was used to control civilians. It was used precisely to attack villages and to kill women and children: that was the purpose, you can read it in the records. It was even used to collect taxes; they would terrorise and intimidate people by terror-bombing and make them pay the taxes.

<P>The RAF (Royal Air Force) general command in Cairo asked for authorisation in 1919 to use chemical weapons "against recalcitrant Arabs as experiment." (This was right after the First World War -- "chemical weapons" meant poison gas, which was the ultimate horror at the time. The Germans had used it and it was considered the worst atrocity ever.) The India Office thought it might not be a good idea because of political problems. It went back to the War Department, where the official in charge denounced the India Office for what he called its "squeamishness" over the use of chemical weapons. He said, "I am strongly in favour of using poisoned gas against uncivilised tribes." He said the use of gas will cause "a lively terror," it is just the application of modern science to warfare, nothing wrong with it, and he said that it would be "improper to deny our troops any weapon at all" that would allow them to put down the unrest in the frontier. That gentleman was named Winston Churchill, a great hero of the West.

<P>Incidentally, the British had already used poison gas. They used it against the Bolsheviks in the intervention in Russia. In fact the British GHQ, the high command, attributed some of its early successes to the effective use of poison gas. Poison gas after the First World War was like nuclear weapons after the Second World War. There is nothing that the West will not do it if wants. Who is going to stop it? Are Western intellectuals going to protest? You'll wait a long time till you hear that. They won't even tell you what happened int he past, let alone protest about what is happening today.


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Frontline:</B> You have had experience in the peace movement, as an organiser and a participant, for the last 25 years. How would you compare the nature and composition of the peace movement in the U.S. today with the movement against the Vietnam war?</FONT>


<P><B>Chomsky:</B> That movement was extremely narrow and marginal. It was mostly young people. There are a lot of delusions about it. After the war started getting costly, everyone suddenly announced that they had been an early opponent of the war, but that is all fraud. In fact, everyone supported the war, especially the liberal intellectuals, until it got costly. When the peace movement was really serious, it was young people, young students mostly. That is a significant group, but socially marginal. IN the 1970s, the movements extended, they got broader based, and they became really rooted in the society. They turned to different things, like the feminist movement, which is a very significant movement, though there are a lot of differences, or the ecological and environmental movements or the anti-nuclear movement. These became middle-class mass movements. In the 1980s, it spread even further. The solidarity movements with regard to Central America were very powerful: these were the first real Third World solidarity movements in the U.S. You find those more in churches in Kansas than you would in the universities in the north- east. That was a mainstream American, middle-class movement, very largely rooted in churches.

<P>That is what it is like now. The opposition to the war now is not particularly students. You will not find it so much on campus; you find more in mainstream America. As I mentioned, the National Council of Churches -- which is a very mainstream organisation -- is the one which came out immediately condemning the sanctions for being much too harsh. Virtually every organised religious group, with the exception of the Jewish groups, has come out in opposition to the war. In the Bishops' Council you will find much more opposition to the war than you will find in the Harvard Faculty Club.


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Frontline:</B> Who, in your opinion, will be the gainers and who the losers -- in economic, social and also in moral and human terms -- of this war?</FONT>


<P><B>Chomsky:</B> It depends on how it turns out. If the U.S. and British strategy works and they can win a relatively quick victory, the gainers will be the Gulf dictatorships, U.S. banks, which will get a big flow of capital from the Gulf dictatorships, and the ailing U.S. and British economies. The gainers will be those who want to see the U.S. and Britain as mercenary forces, which sell their services as killers to other people in the world and thereby prop up their collapsing economies. They will be the gainers. The losers will be most of the people in the world, as happens in every war.


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Frontline:</B> In terms of international relations, what do countries like Egypt, Israel, Turkey expect to gain?</FONT>


<P><B>Chomsky:</B> That is a different story. Egypt hopes to get a huge pay- off, in fact they already have got one. Egypt is in very bad trouble; they are hoping to get tens of billions of dollars of aid and support, and they are getting it.

<P>Israel hopes to see the Arab world destroyed -- that would be terrific, wouldn't it? Israel is very happy, actually. A big Arab force is being destroyed, and the U.S. is forcing Russian Jews to go to Israel. (It is not that they are being <I>allowed</I> to go to Israel, they are being <I>forced</I> to go to Israel, and the U.S. changed its immigration laws so as to deny them free choice. If they had free choice, they would come to the U.S.) Israel very much wants Europeans -- blonde-blue-eyed types -- and they are going there. Israel has for a long time rejected any political settlement and now it feels that, you know, the facts are going to make it win. It will have this huge flow of immigrants coming in, and will be able to crush the indigenous Palestinian population, who will starve to death or, if they wanted jobs, will be forced to emigrate. The U.S. will of course continue to block any political settlement. Israel will be left with its huge nuclear weapons capacity and its major military force while the rest of the Arab world declines, except for the Gulf dictatorships, and they are note really anti-Israel. These are totalitarians who have no records about what happens internally but I am sure that if we had such a record, we would find that the Saudi Arabian elite is rather happy that Israel is there as a threat against what is called radical Arab nationalism. You will have the alliance that has existed int he past -- Israel and Saudi Arabia and the U.S. in the background, with Britain tagging along pretending as usual that it is doing something.

<P>Turkey is an interesting case. Turkey wants to be able to ensure that it can crush its Kurdish minority and that it can maintain its control over northern Cyprus. It probably has its eyes on the Mosul province, which the Turks have always believed -- with some justice -- was stolen from them by the British in the Imperial Settlement. (That is where there is a lot of oil.) If Iraq is rally dismembered, which is a possibility, Turkey might just move into the Mosul province (probably killing every Kurd in sight as they go along) and take over the oil. That is a possibility.

<P>The Kurdish issue -- quite apart from the horror of it -- is an interesting issue. The U.S. has a very simple way of weakening the Iraqi army in Kuwait, namely, by supporting a Kurdish insurrection. If you support a Kurdish insurrection in the north, Iraq would have to draw off substantial troops from the south to put it down. According to Kurdish sources, they have been asking for support for insurrection and they have been denied. That is quite interesting; of course, you do not care how many Iraqis you fill, but you are supposed to care how many Americans you dill, that is supposed to count. The Bush administration is willing to see American soldiers killed in order not to support a Kurdish insurrection in the north. The reason for that is to placate Turkey. Turkey is suppressing its own huge Kurdish population and the last thing it wants is a Kurdish uprising next door. In order to allow to help Turkey repress its own Kurds, the U.S. is willing to keep the Iraqi army in the south facing an American ground onslaught.

<P>Again, the disciplined American intellectuals will not mention this fact. The only mention of it that I have seen is in the <CITE>Wall Street Journal,</CITE> which is a business newspaper, so a little less constrained than some of the others.

<P>The Arab states, even the ones supporting the U.S., are not very happy about the destruction of Iraq, because they have other problems. One of their problems is Iran. The conflict between Iran and the Arab states goes back to the biblical period and it continues. They consider Iraq as a kind of barrier against Iran and they know that if Iraq is destroyed they are going to be open to Iranian pressures, so they have mixed feelings about that.

<P>War takes on its own pace: you cannot fine-tune it. You cannot decide: I am going to destroy Iraq, but only up to the point where it still remains a barrier to Iran. Once war gets started, it goes its own way.


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Frontline:</B> Last question. Given its performance in the Gulf and West Asia, what does the New World Order augur for the people of your other area of interest, Central America?</FONT>


<P><B>Chomsky:</B> It is a catastrophe. Throughout the Third World it has been an utter catastrophe in the last 10 or 20 years. People talk about the disaster of communism; but the catastrophes of capitalism make communism look like a paradise. In fact, I have just done a couple of survey articles reviewing the state of the people who supposedly won the Cold War. Let us run through the victims of the Cold War: Latin America, Africa, Asia -- go through it country after country, it is a total catastrophe. It has gotten a lot worse in the last 10 years.

<P>The U.S. won a big victory in Central America. There was a chance of democracy and social reform back in the late 1970s and that has been crushed. They have murdered a couple of hundred thousand people, countries are in chaos, countries are destroyed, they have been beaten back to the level of 30 or 40 years ago. Many of these countries may not even survive. What the U.S. did in Central America is to establish the effectiveness of the rule of terror and violence. It is now trying to establish the same lesson globally. In the Middle East, if that works, the consequences for the rest of the Third World are grim. This war is basically another war in the Vasco da Gama era of world history, to use an India-related term for it. For the last 500 years Europe has been savagely conquering the world and this is another one of those episodes. For the victims, most of the world outside Europe (Europe now means Europe, the U.S. and Japan), the future is very grim.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>David Barsamian:</B> I'd like to ask you a few questions and then we'd like to open it up to our listeners. The U.S. economy has been structured on what you call alternatively "the Pentagon system" or "military Keynesianism," that is, a state subsidy of high-technology industry. In light of the U.S./U.S.S.R. rapprochement, what moves, if any, do you see the state and corporate managers of the U.S. economy taking to preserve their power and privilege?</FONT>

<P><B>Noam Chomsky:</B> I think they are concerned about it. You can read in the Wall Street Journal, for example, articles with headlines like "Unsettling Specter of Peace Concerns U.S. Analysts." And rightly so. This has been the major technique of state industrial management since about 1950, the technique by which the government policy essentially compels the public to subsidize research and development for high-technology industry. But also, beyond that, for the pharmaceutical companies and others. There's no obvious alternative available. For the moment, there is a kind of leveling of military expenditure. Actually, this year's military budget was the biggest ever. It's supposed to level off at about that for a while. For the foreseeable future they're talking about cutbacks, but if you look they're really not cutbacks, they're just a lack of projected expansion. Even those modifications are generally going to hit outlays, they'll cut down the force level, for example, while keeping the procurement level the same. For the moment, at least, the plans are to maintain those parts of the military system which do in effect feed into advanced industry. There are some very serious problems coming up. The Reagan Administration, which pushed this state intervention in the economy well beyond the norm, also in the last year or so began to organize Pentagon-based consortia, Semetech is the main one. In order to keep the semiconductor industry viable, Silicon Valley, etc., there is no clear alternative on the horizon to more public funding, meaning in our system through the Pentagon. So right now there's no obvious alternative being suggested. Yesterday there was some testimony in Congress by former Secretary of Defense McNamara and others calling for a very substantial military cutback, McNamara proposed about 50%, arguing strictly on military grounds and doubtless on military grounds what he said was even highly conservative, but as far as I can see from the papers he didn't address these problems, which are the central ones.


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Barsamian:</B> You've said that if there were going to be a move toward conversion, that is, getting away from the Pentagon system, that it's going to involve something like a social revolution.</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> It's hard to conceive of how it could be done. It's true that other industrial democracies do it. Germany and Japan, for example, have a much lower percentage of military expenditures and have devised other ways for government coordination and subsidy for the industrial system.


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Barsamian:</B> MITI, for example, in Japan is the state consortium that organizes the economy.</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Yes. In Japan there's a ministry, MITI, Ministry of International Trade and Industry, which serves as a kind of coordinating agency. The Japanese economy is very differently structured. There are big financial-industrial conglomerates and they through the coordination of MITI basically lay out the planning, distribute investments, etc. for the forthcoming period. That gives a pretty high level of planning. The culture is quite different. The population is very docile and they basically do what they're told. It's straightforward for the Japanese government and industry simply to say, look, here's the level of consumption for next year and here are the prices. I don't think that would wash in the United States. The population is too independent.


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Barsamian:</B> Have you noticed any hostility or traces or racism vis-a-vis Japan? I have, and that's why I'm asking you. You see it in cartoons and editorials and in a new Hollywood film out called Black Rain. Things like: the Japanese work too hard, they save too much, they have unfair trade practices, etc.</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Of course there's a lot of that, and there's a good deal of concern about Japan. It's true that their level of saving is far higher. The quality of their goods is much better. They're buying in very heavily into central sectors of the American economy right now. For the first time there's major Japanese investment in the U.S. high-tech industry, which is one of the last things that still functions around here, mainly through Pentagon facilitation. More visible than that is buying Columbia Pictures and Rockefeller Center, but picking up the leading sectors of the high-tech industry is much more significant in the long run. The Japanese soon will be in a position to constrain U.S. military expenditures, since they control a good deal of the advanced technology that's required for fancy military production, and some Japanese have actually threatened it.


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Barsamian:</B> In your view, have the American media played their traditional role of obscuring reality from the American public, in this case the fact that the Pentagon system of economics in the United States has seriously eroded and corroded this country's ability to manufacture consumer goods?</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> That certainly hasn't been a very big topic, I doubt whether you'll see an article about it. It's a mixed story. Without the Pentagon system we'd need some other system of state capitalist industrial management. The fact of the matter is that although there's a lot of talk about capitalism and free enterprise and free markets, no one who's actually involved in the business world believes a word of it. It's fine for after-dinner speeches and editorials, but when push comes to shove, the sectors of the economy that work and the industrial economies that are successful are those that have a substantial state coordinating and subsidizing component. The same business-man who will make a passionate speech about free trade in an after-dinner speech will also go off to Washington and make sure that the subsidies keep flowing. The question is what alternative system is going to be set up.


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Barsamian:</B> Do you have something in mind?</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> That's where I think there ought to be social revolution. It seems to me that these decisions should not be made by business and the representatives of business who we call government. These should be popular decisions. They should be made beginning from the plant floor and from the community, and that would mean social control over investment. That's a social revolution.


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Barsamian:</B> That leads into my next question: Do you think the outbreak of popular democracy in Eastern Europe might be viewed with some trepidation by U.S. elites? What if it were to spread to this country?</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> As you notice, they're really dragging their feet for all kinds of reasons. For one thing, popular movements are always frightening, even when they're overthrowing some enemy, because there's a spreading effect. It's not the kind of thing that ought to happen. It leads to these "crises of democracy" that elites are always worried about. There is a possible contagious effect. Also, it's bringing about changes in Europe that U.S. elites are pretty wary about. Western Europe is moving towards greater integration and also greater independence, and it's looking to restore what are in effect quasi colonial relations with the East. Japan probably has the same idea with regard to exploitation of Siberia. That kind of integration of the Eurasian economies, with a large part of the current Soviet bloc becoming a kind of Third World to be exploited by Europe and Japan, that would turn the United States into a second-class actor on the world scene. The United States is very concerned to make sure that the blocs are maintained, the Warsaw Pact, NATO. NATO functions to keep U.S. influence in Europe and a degree of control, and in fact the confrontation makes Europe to some extent reliant on the United States. The United States has been trying to block East-West trade and has been pretty isolated in that. In general, there's a good deal of conflict brewing.


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Barsamian:</B> It seems that so much of at least the promotion of the Pentagon system within the United States is predicated on the "Evil Empire" or some kind of enemy: the Russians are coming, the terrorists are coming, the Libyans, the Nicaraguans, right now it's the drug lords. Who is going to be the enemy to fuel this system?</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> I think it's going to be very hard with the Russian threat becoming less and less credible. There's was always a tremendous amount of exaggeration and hype about the Russian threat, but at least there was some substance behind it. It was, after all, an Evil Empire. That wasn't false. It was brutal and it had missiles and it did ugly things. That had very little relation to any of the alleged threats to us, but that much was real. There was an attempt in the 1980s to try to find substitutes: international terrorism, crazed Arabs running around to kill us. Don't forget that that had a degree of success, enough to just about kill the tourist industry in Europe in 1986 because Americans were afraid to go to Europe because of Libyans, who weren't there. Right now, in this last fall, there was an effort to manufacture hysteria about a drug war which was supposed to take the place of the Evil Empire. These things have a short life span. They work for a while, but it's very hard to keep them up. I don't think it's going to be so easy to find a credible enemy. Maybe it'll be the Japanese.


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Barsamian:</B> Joel Brinkley, in the New York Times of Sunday, December 10th, in a long article on the intifada, begins his piece with "24 months into the revolt, many Palestinians are beginning to lose their buoyant mood." My question to you is, what kind of measures are the Israeli military authorities taking that might be contributing to a lessening of Palestinian buoyancy?</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> There is, first of all, an increase in violence. They're shooting much more freely. Casualties are going up. Killings of children are going up. The constraints on use of live ammunition are reducing. But that's the least of it. What they're actually doing is extending over the territories I think the world's most extensive system of totalitarian control. The worst thing that's going on right now is arbitrary acts. There's what's called, for example, the "invisible transfer." In the last couple of months, hundreds of people, almost all women and young children, have been forcibly expelled from their villages and sent across to Jordan. The troops come in the middle of the night, 3 o'clock in the morning helicopters come into the village, using collaborators, and go into particular homes, wake the family up with loudspeakers, call for all the men to go into the village square and congregate. Then the troops come in, tell the women you've got five minutes to pack up with your children and get on a taxi which you're going to pay for and go to the Jordan River, where you will pay for travel across the bridge. If you don't do it we'll do it for you, we'll stick the kid in the cab and send him. When the man come back their families are gone. There's a lot of things like that, either humiliation or arbitrary acts of punishment or control of every aspect of life. Right now, for example, they're reviving the old village leagues. That was an attempt made in 1982 to control the population through networks of corrupt collaborators called village leagues, local people. Most typically local populations are controlled by local collaborators, that's the way South Africa ran the black ghettos, in fact it's the way the Nazis ran the Warsaw ghetto. The village leagues didn't work at the time, but now they're trying to reinstitute them. It will mean that a number of corrupt officials collaborating with the Israelis will have control over every aspect of life. If you want a driver's license, if you want to cross the street, if you want to get married -- you pay these guys off. All in all, there's a network of very tight controls, arbitrary harassment, daily humiliation, severe punishments, beatings, a whole network of actions to make the population understand that life is going to be totally unlivable unless they completely submit to Israeli authority and, as the expression goes, don't raise their heads.


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Barsamian:</B> You cover some of these issues in your January, 1990 article in Z magazine entitled "The Art of Evasion: Diplomacy in the Middle East." I was wondering if you could talk about the non-violent tax-resistance campaign that was going on in the West Bank Palestinian town of Beit Sahuor, particularly a comment that you made to me a couple of weeks ago that the American peace movement really failed on this one.</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> This was a completely non-violent protest in a Christian town on the West Bank, by West Bank standards a relatively well-off town. The protest was a tax resistance protest, refusal to pay taxes, which is a very legitimate act. The taxes are not used for the benefit of the local population. They're extortion, really, and are used for imprisoning them more effectively. They refused to pay their taxes. Yitzhak Rabin, the Defense Minister, stated very clearly that they're going to be severely punished for this. The town was placed under curfew. There were lots of arbitrary arrests and beatings. It ended up with confiscation of most of the property in the town, the robbery of most of the property in the town. They were very steadfast about it. They kept at it and they're still keeping at it. To get back to the point you raised: There is a non-violent movement in the United States which exhorts people to undertake non-violent resistance and talks and lauds non-violent resistance. People who talk about non-violent resistance can be taken seriously, as the more serious advocates of non-violence have pointed out, A.J. Muste and others. They can be taken seriously if they don't just talk but if they in fact put themselves on the line, participate as best they can in supporting on-going non-violent resistance. Non-violent resistance activities cannot succeed against an enemy that is able freely to use violence. That's pretty obvious. You can't have non-violent resistance against the Nazis in a concentration camp, to take an extreme case, but the same holds generally. Non-violent resistance can succeed if there's erosion of the capacity to oppress, and that means participation within the camp of the oppressor. We're directly involved in all of this. The United States funds it, pays for it, encourages it. There was no reaction here that I noticed, no detectable reaction in support of these non-violent resistance activities. This has been true for many years, long before the intifada there were efforts at non-violent resistance on the West Bank which were simply crushed by force. Merchant strikes, for example. When merchants struck in protest against the occupation, the Israeli Army would just come in and weld their shops closed or break in and force them to open or take them out and arrest them. Naturally, that breaks up any act of non-violent resistance. Since there was no reaction here and essentially no reaction in Israel, the oppression could continue. That tells us that the call upon people to resort to non-violent means is not being made seriously. Maybe it's the right thing to do or maybe it isn't the right thing to do, but you can't take seriously people who call on others to carry out non-violent resistance but who don't participate to help them when they do it.


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Barsamian:</B> In your article you state that the Baker plan is the Shamir plan.</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Actually the Shamir-Peres plan, because the two parties in Israel, contrary to what's reported here, are in consensus agreement. There's basically no difference between them on these issues.


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Barsamian:</B> Is there any room for Palestinian representation within that formula?</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> No. They're very explicit about it. As far as I'm aware, the terms of the Baker-Shamir-Peres plan have never even been published here, at least anywhere near the mainstream, which is kind of interesting, since this is the only proposal on the table as far as the U.S. government is concerned and as far as the U.S. media are concerned. So here's the only proposal on the table, as they constantly drum into us, and they don't tell us what it is. The Baker-Shamir-Peres plan begins with what are called its basic premises, which are three: first, that there can be "no additional Palestinian state between Israel and Jordan." The point is, both parties in Israel will assert, there already is a Palestinian state, namely Jordan. If the Palestinians and the Jordanians don't agree, that's their problem, but Israel has determined that that already is a Palestinian state and there can't be another one. That means that there's no issue of Palestinian self-determination. They've already got it. There can't be another one. That's the first premise. The second premise is that there can be no negotiations with the PLO, which Israel agrees is the representative for the Palestinians in the territories. The reason why there can be no negotiations with the PLO has made very clear and explicit. Prime Minister Shamir a couple of days ago said in the Knesset that he was willing to talk to Satan but not to the PLO. The reason is not that the PLO is a terrorist organization, he went on, but because if you talk to the PLO you're talking about a Palestinian state, and that we will never accept. So point number two in the basic premise is no negotiations with the political representatives of the Palestinians, the reason being that that would involve the question of a Palestinian state. The third basic premise is that there will be no change in the status of Gaza, Samaria and Judea, the occupied territories, except in accord with the guidelines of the government, and those guidelines exclude the possibility of Palestinian self-determination. Those are the basic premises of the agreement. Then it goes on about the modalities for reaching this result. That's not a serious proposal, which is why the United States is alone in the world in supporting it. The Times itself has point out that there's no other country apart from the United States which has endorsed this plan. But in this respect I should say that the subservience of the media is mind-boggling. Take the New York Times. They've never reported the terms of this plan. They've said, look, this is the only plan there is, there's nothing else on the table. They have pointed out explicitly that there isn't another country in the world that supports it outside the United States, but just yesterday there was an article in the New York Times headlined "Soviets Trying to Become Team Player in Mideast." They're trying to become a team player. What does that mean? They've moved away from their support for radical positions in their policy of confrontation with the United States and they now want to join with the United States. So to become a team player means to join with the United States off the spectrum of world opinion. What were those "radical positions" that they were advocating? They were advocating a two-state settlement like just about everyone else in the world. You can't imagine what's in the minds of people who could write this sort of thing. They say that the United States is totally isolated but the Soviets are trying to become a "team player" by joining with us. In other words, if the world isn't on our side, the world's just wrong. And we're the team, even if the whole world's on the other side.


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Barsamian:</B> As you so often have pointed out, the peace process is by definition anything that the United States proposes.</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> That is the way it works, but I must say that it's kind of astonishing to see the extreme levels of self-delusion and deception that are reached in a highly ideological society like ours. People can read that headline: Soviets Trying to Become Team Player in Mideast, to join us in opposition to the rest of the world, and not laugh.


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Barsamian:</B> Let's talk about Central America. The five Central American presidents in Costa Rica on December 12 issued an accord in which they said, among other things, that they expressed their "decisive support of Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani and his government as a faithful demonstration of their commitment to democracy and they energetically demand in addition that the FMLN publicly renounce all types of violent actions that may directly or indirectly affect the civilian population." I'm interested to know why Daniel Ortega would sign such an agreement.</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> His back's against the wall. They're desperate to try to get the United States to live up to the earlier agreements on disbanding the contras, and apparently they're willing to sign anything. This is a great victory for the United States, this accord yesterday. The only explicit thing that's said in the agreement is that the United States must immediately stop any kind of funding for the contras and must send funds through the United Nations, but of course everyone understands that the United States will disregard that, because the United States doesn't obey any international laws or agreements. That's a given. So though that's there, it's completely meaningless. Washington has already announced that it's meaningless. So we can put that aside. However, the reason why it's a major victory for the United States is that for years the United States has been trying to draw a parallel between the FMLN guerrillas and the contras. The parallel is ludicrous on the face of it. The FMLN is an indigenous guerrilla force consisting mainly of people who were driven to the hills by U.S.-organized terror. They fight within their own country with essentially nothing in the way of support. The contras, on the other hand, are a foreign-organized mercenary army constructed by the United States, the superpower that runs the region, based in a foreign country, provided with armaments at a level that goes beyond that of many Latin American armies, unheard of by any guerrilla force. They have no political program. They don't even have the remotest resemblance to guerrillas. So for the United States to establish that parallel -- the parallel has been regarded as ridiculous over the years, but through the unremitting use of violence and terror the United States has succeeded in establishing that parallel, and it has also succeeded in establishing the legitimacy of this murderous terror state which its own population doesn't regard as having anything to do with democracy. El Salvador has polls. They're never published here because they have the wrong results, but over the years when the United States was raving about Salvadoran democracy the polls were showing that about ten percent of the population saw a democratic process in operation. The point is nobody can look at that government or the conditions under which it was elected and say the word "democracy" without shuddering. But the United States, just by virtue of its monopoly over the means of violence and terror, has succeeded in establishing its conditions. And of course the requirements in the accords that the United States is supposed to live up to are immediately recognized as meaningless because the United States doesn't live up to agreements.


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Barsamian:</B> Given what you have just said, and also in light of the rather astonishing and sustained FMLN attack in November and early December of 1989 in the capital city of San Salvador, how are the media in the U.S. and the political leadership going to persuade the American public that on the one hand you have this parallel of the struggling, budding democracy in El Salvador vs. this horrible dictatorship in Nicaragua?</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> How are they going to convince them? I think it's been done already. It's been done years ago. There's been virtual unanimity in the U.S. media -- this goes back to the early 1980s -- that El Salvador is a fledgling democracy and that Nicaragua is a totalitarian state that never had an election. Here the American media are basically unanimous. As you know, I've done a lot of detailed analysis of this, and departures from this party line are at the level of statistical error. In these matters the United States is as uniform as the best organized totalitarian state.


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Barsamian:</B> We're going to go to some phone calls now.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Caller:</B> My question is this: Given everything that's going on, the total lack of responsiveness of the U.S. government to Central America, to the Middle East, to our own domestic problems as well, and given that these are both Democratic and Republicans doing it, that those that fund the death squads in El Salvador and the brutality on the West Bank, that's done with votes from the Democratic party, it seems to me that we really do need some kind of a social, if not revolution, then a very fast evolution. My question is how to build it. It seems to me that whatever we do has to end up going through the political arena. I don't want to make this a forced choice; if you see a third way I'd like to hear it. It seems to me that we've really got a choice of either working within the Democratic party or of trying what you could call either a third party or truly a second party. Both of those ways have been tried in the past and neither has succeeded. Do you have any comment on which of these two ways is more likely to succeed?</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> I think it is a kind of forced choice. The fact is that I have nothing against working through a two-party system if one existed. The point is that political parties don't grow out of a social vacuum. They reflect the social reality. The social reality in the United States is that this is a business-run society. Those who control investment decisions and control resources also overwhelmingly control the political system. We don't have a two-party system in the United States. We have a one-party system, and we've had it through most of American history. That one party consists of two shifting factions of the business party, the "property party," as C. Wright Mills called it. That's why, as you said, the parties basically agree: because they represent the same social sectors. They represent those who fund them. They represent the interests of owners, managers, relatively privileged sectors, etc. There are exceptions to this, but again, it's kind of around the margins. There's very little political participation in the United States. Incumbents in Congress almost always win. In the last election I think it was something like 98% incumbency, which is less turnover than there was in the Politburo in the pre-Gorbachev period, which means that there's really no issues coming up. People aren't shifting around because they reflect different sectors of the population or different issues. They stay because they're there. In presidential elections, nobody even pretends that there are any issues. In the 1988 election the only question was could Dukakis figure out a way to duck the mud being thrown at him by Lee Atwater. That was the issue in the 1988 election. In earlier elections the issue was could Ronald Reagan remember the lines that he was told to read. But issues don't arise. And when they do the population doesn't care about them. So to talk about operating within the political system is a little misleading. We don't have a political system, except rather marginally. If I could reframe your question: The question would be, How can we create a functioning political system. That means, how can we create the social background out of which political issues can arise and the population can become actively involved in formulating political positions, in putting them on the agenda, clarifying them, determining which ones they want and which ones they don't want, and then struggling for them. That would be a social revolution. Then you could do it through the present formal system. That's the kind of change that's required. That doesn't happen here because there just aren't ways for people to get together at a sufficient level to enter into this process. Maybe you can do it in local elections in Boulder because the scale is small enough so that it can be done. But to do it on a large community level or the state level or the national level requires organization and resources. In many industrial democracies it's done through the unions, but the United States basically doesn't have unions. We have a very class-conscious business class, and that's it. That's where class consciousness ends. They've seen to it that unions are very weak and even when they functioned, except for a brief period, they were basically business unions. It's hard to remember now that there was a bitter decade-long struggle with a lot of heroism and a tremendous resistance and dedication to try to achieve a 40-hour week. The 40-hour week lasted a couple of years after it was achieved. By now it's an idle dream. For families now it's more like a 100-hour week, because one wage earner isn't enough for the family to survive. But workers don't expect to work a 40-hour week. The achievements of the union movement, which were not unreal, are being very rapidly eroded. There's been a steady decline in real wages in the United States since 1973. That's absolutely without any historical precedent. It's in part because of the success of the business classes and their class warfare, destroying any organized resistance. That's just one major aspect of the depoliticization of the society. Formally, the formal democratic system looks good on paper. I don't think that paper reforms are very important. The question is, does it function? The answer is: It functions as a reflection of the social reality, but that social reality happens to marginalize from decision-making all but a very small sector of highly privileged parts of the population.


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Caller:</B> It seems that, Professor Chomsky, you are merely a critic of society and you don't have a definite program or political alternative or system that you are clearly advocating. In what you write and what you say you give only the barest and vaguest solutions. You talk vaguely of a social revolution or something of this nature, but you don't say concretely what you believe in. Another point I'd like to ask you about is if you think the Pentagon budget, which is only about 6% of the GNP, and military procurement is only 2% or 3% of the GNP, if you think that exists to benefit high-tech industries, it seems like it would make more sense for the government to directly fund high-tech industries if they wanted to do that. Probably the public would be even more supportive of it, like they are in Japan. Number three: I've heard you criticize and criticize and go on and on about what you dislike about the United States' political and economic system. Is there anything, anything that you have ever said, or could you say something now, about the U.S. political and economic system that you approve of, that you think is an achievement, a success? I like to hear if you can say anything positive about the politics and economics of this country.</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> On the first point: You say I haven't written about what I believe is an alternative. That's just not true. I've written a lot about it. You probably haven't read it, but then it's not easily accessible. I've written quite a lot about what I think a libertarian society should look like and what it would mean to take the radical democratic ideals of the Enlightenment, for example, and translate them into a form in which they would apply to a modern industrial society. I could go on to describe it. I'll be glad to give you references, but point number one is just not true. Point number two: The figures about percentage of GNP are almost totally meaningless. The point is that the corporate managers in advanced industry -- this is true of electronics, computers, pharmaceuticals, etc. -- except that the government, meaning the public, will pick up the costly parts of the production process, the parts that are not profitable -- research and development. That's got to be paid for by the public. Furthermore, the public, through the Pentagon, provides a state-guaranteed market, which is available for waste production if commercial markets don't work. That is a gift to the corporate managers. It's a cushion for planning. When something can be sold on the market, you sell it. If not, the public purchases it and destroys it. Furthermore, the public pays the cost while the corporation makes the profit. If you take a look at particular industries you can see how this works. Take, say, the computer industry, the core of the modern industrial economy. I'm kind of smoothing the edges here, but the story is essentially accurate. You can put in tenth-order effect, if you like. In the 1950s, computers were not marketable, so the public paid 100% of the cost of research, development and production through the Pentagon. By the 1960s, they were beginning to be marketable in the commercial market, so the public participation declined to about 50%. The idea is that the public pays the costs, the corporations make the profits. Public subsidy, private profit; that's what we call free enterprise. By the 1980s there were very substantial new expenditures required for advances in fifth-generation computers and new fancy parallel processing systems, etc. So the public's share in the costs went up very substantially through Star Wars and the Pentagon, etc. That's the way it works. Percentage of GNP doesn't tell you anything relevant to this process. As to why the government doesn't just come to the population and play it the Japanese way: The answer is, in my view, and this has been the answer that business has given and I think they're right, that the public here wouldn't tolerate it. This is not a docile, submissive population like Japan. You can't come to the population here and tell them: Look, next year you're going to cut back on your consumption by this amount so that IBM can make more profits and then maybe ten years from now your son or your daughter will get a job. That wouldn't wash. What you tell people here is: The Russians are coming, so we better send up a lot of missiles into space and maybe out of that will come something useful for IBM and then maybe your son will get a job in ten years. Those last parts you don't bother saying.


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Caller:</B> Who are you quoting? Are you quoting yourself or some analyst in the military or what?</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> What I'm saying is what politicians in the United States say.


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Caller:</B> I've never heard them say that.</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> You've never heard a politician in the United States say, the Russians are coming, we have to have more missiles.


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Caller:</B> I never heard them say that we need it because we have to fund some high-tech industries.</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> You didn't hear what I just said. I said that the last two sentences I added were not what is publicly said. How you do it in the United States is you say, look, we've got to defend ourselves, we need Star Wars, we need the Pentagon system, and the effect of that is to achieve what I just described with regard to the computer industry, or the semiconductor industry, or whatever. That is because this is a relatively free society. If politicians were to approach the public telling them, look, we've decided that next year you're going to cut back on your consumption so that IBM will make more profit, the reaction in the United States would be a healthy reaction: Who are you to tell me to cut back so that IBM will make more profit? If it's going to be a social decision of that kind, I want to take part in it. And that's precisely why business does not want to be put in those terms. They do not want social policy, which is going to you organized people, to become involved in making decisions over investment. This issue has come up over the years, many times, in the business press. Go back to the 1940s. It was recognized, as any economist will tell you, that you can get the same priming effect for industry, maybe even more efficient, through other forms of government intervention besides military production.


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Caller:</B> Right. That's my point.</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Sure you can do that, but it's irrelevant, and business understands exactly why it's irrelevant. You can read editorials in Business Week going back to the late 1940s where they point out there are two techniques: one technique is the military system, the other technique would be social spending, infrastructure development, hospitals, services, etc. or useful production. But the latter is no good. It will work from a technical, economic point of view, but it has all sorts of unwelcome side effects, for example, it tends to organize public constituencies. If the government gets involved in carrying out activities that affect the public existence directly, people will want to get involved in it.


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Caller:</B> Professor Chomsky, it's a pleasure to ask you these questions. I'm from Canada, where your books are obtainable in virtually every bookstore. Your last book, Necessary Illusions, is on a paperback non-fiction bestseller list. I don't see the same availability of your thoughts in America. That's the first question: Why is that? The second question is: Do you have any comment on the elite media coverage of the situation in El Salvador regarding the six Jesuit priests? The third question is, regarding the Middle East: A comment that I'm hearing again and again from people like Martin Peretz and others regarding the Palestinians is that these are Muslims, they're tribal savages, they're pre-Enlightenment and they pose a threat to Israel. Israel is a democracy. Why should we consider allowing another dagger to be pointed at Israel's existence? I'd appreciate your comments on those three questions.</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> As for the availability of books, your description is correct, but that's only one part of it. For example, this book that you mentioned was based on lectures that were delivered over Canadian Broadcasting Corporation on problems of thought control in industrial societies. It would be next to impossible for anything comparable to happen in the United States on any major public outlet. The United States is different from most other societies in that respect. Most industrial societies, even ones that are very much like us, have a good deal more openness on their public media to dissident opinion. There are a lot of reasons for that. The previous caller had asked whether I had ever said anything nice about the United States. The answer is, very often. One of the things that's extremely nice about the United States is the degree of freedom that it has. It is a free society, much more so than any other, and that very freedom has led to problems. If you can't control people by force, you have to figure out other ways to control them. Corresponding to American freedom, which is unusual, are very highly sophisticated measures of ensuring that that freedom doesn't work, and one of them is the one that you're describing. A whole array of devices have been developed to ensure that dissident opinion just isn't heard, although it isn't suppressed either, given American freedoms. So what you're describing is true, and I could elaborate the way it works if you like.

<P>With regard to the second point, the coverage of the murder of the priests: The murder of the priests was considered an outrageous act here, and that particular action was covered reasonably well. It's always considered a mistake for a friendly government to commit atrocities essentially in front of television cameras. They should commit them when nobody's looking, and killing of priests, obviously by the military, that's bad news. Therefore, there was some coverage of it. But the coverage will decline, and under U.S. pressure there may be a decision made. If the government of El Salvador is smart, they'll find some scapegoat, a lieutenant, and put him on trial and then put him away in some country house somewhere for the crime. But the chances that they'll go after the authorities who are responsible, say, the higher officers of the First Brigade, that's very unlikely, and it's even more unlikely that the American press will point out what that means. What does it mean, for example, that the one witness had to be spirited out of the country to the United States so that she could survive? What does that tell us about the democratic society we're supporting if the one witness to the murder of six priests can't be kept in the country because she'll be murdered? Exactly what does that tell you? It's clear what it tells you, but that wasn't the lesson that was drawn from it in the editorials. So the event itself was covered, and after that the cover-up begins, and it will be continuing.

<P>On the matter of the Palestinians, I'm sure that what you heard is what many people say, and the only thing that I can respond to, apart from the false statements, is the level of racism it reflects. That reflects the assumption that there are human beings, the Jews, the Israelis, who are human beings and have rights, and then there are these strange animals, the indigenous population, who aren't human beings and who don't have rights, and what right do those animals have to threaten the human beings? That's not something that's unique in European or American history. It was attitudes like that that made it possible for those who conquered the United States, the European settlers, to basically wipe out the indigenous population, who, as George Washington once put it, were not really humans, they were just wolves who looked like men. As long as that's true, you can do anything you like to them. I think those are the attitudes that you're reflecting, the same attitudes expressed by the worst sectors of white South Africans. There's no arguing with those positions, any more than you could argue with a Nazi who told you that the Jews weren't human.


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Caller:</B> I have a couple of questions about Eastern Europe. The first one is: Are you concerned about some of the forces that may be unleashed, especially nationalism, with the recent democracy movements? Secondly, do you see any down side or any unanticipated consequences to German reunification?</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> I think both of those are very serious concerns. The Soviet Empire, ugly and tyrannical as it was, did keep the lid on some extremely ugly manifestations. Eastern European nationalism has its very unpleasant aspects, to put it mildly. This is not something unique to Eastern Europe. It's been true all over the world. The history of Western Europe consists of centuries of murderous, barbarous violence while one ethnic group dedicated their existence to destroying some other one. That continued up until 1945. The only reason it stopped then was because the next step would have been to destroy the world. So the establishment of the state system in Europe, which is basically the imposition of a certain formal political system on a network of rival groups who often bitterly hate one another, was a bloody, murderous process. The process hasn't been consummated in the East. As the Russian imperial system begins to erode, it's going to be rearing its head, and it could be an extremely ugly one. We've already seen that in Armenia, Azerbaijan, and we'll see that elsewhere. So yes, I think you're quite right in pointing to that as a very serious problem. It's similar in some respects to what happened when the Ottoman Empire was removed from large parts of western Asia. The Ottoman Empire was a pretty ugly affair, but it did reflect the realities of the region in a way in which the European-imposed state system does not. So it did allow some degree of local community control and it didn't impose sharp borders. You could travel from one end of the Ottoman Empire to the other without passing through customs barriers and troops. The European-imposed state system didn't correspond to the realities of the region at all, and it's been a violent and brutal affair. The same in Africa. The same everywhere. Chances are that will happen in Eastern Europe.

<P>With regard to German unification, that's something that worries everybody. A Frenchman quipped that he loves Germany, loves it so much that he's glad there are two of them. The history of Germany is not so pretty, and a reunified Germany frightens a lot of people. The story of German partition is a pretty complicated one. Right after the war, the United States and Britain were influential -- whether they were decisive you could argue, but they were certainly influential -- in bringing about partition in the first place. The reason was that there was concerned about a unified labor movement in Germany, and influences from the Eastern zone, primarily ideological influences, which would strengthen socialist elements, working-class elements in Western Germany and undermine the British and American project of restoring the old conservative order. That's why people like George Kennan, early on, in 1946, called for "walling off" West Germany from the Eastern zone, that was Kennan's phrase, and stopping what the British Foreign Office called "Russian political aggression," meaning ideological and political influences from the East. That was one factor in the partition of Germany. In 1952, Stalin made an interesting offer -- we don't know if it was serious or not because it was immediately rejected -- calling for reunification of Germany under Four-Power control with free elections, the only condition being that a reunified Germany not join a hostile Western military alliance. Any Russian leader, no matter who it is, is going to insist upon that, for obvious historical reasons. The United States rebuffed that out of hand. In fact it was barely reported, just dismissed, so we don't know if he was serious. The United States much preferred a Europe split into two military pacts: NATO, which was being established at the time, and the Warsaw Pact, which came a couple of years later. There have been several other Russian proposals of this kind over the years, always rejected. Right now you'll notice that the United States is still very ambivalent about it. If you read James Baker's speech in Berlin, which appears in today's papers, you'll notice he was all effusive about democracy in Europe, reunification of Germany, etc. But the bottom line was the same: a reunified Germany has to be part of NATO, he said, meaning it has to be part of a Western military alliance in which the United States will dominate. It's highly unlikely that any Soviet leadership or any East European public would accept that, given the history. It's not so likely that the rest of the West would accept it either, but that's the bottom line. So far, at least, we have not been willing to conceive of the possibility of a neutralized Germany, and that's the only sane possibility for unification.

The Massey Lectures given by Noam Chomsky were aired by the
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) from November 28 - December 2, 1988.
Chomsky's book <A HREF="../ni/ni.html"><CITE>Necessary Illusions</CITE></A> (South End Press, 1989) is based on those
talks. These are some of the questions a panel of Canadian journalists asked
Chomsky afterwards. Words that are unclear from the tape appear in round

<TABLE> <TR VALIGN = TOP><TD ALIGN = left><B>DF: </B>
<TD ALIGN = left>You say that what the media do is to ignore certain kinds of
atrocities that are committed by us and our friends and to play up enormously
atrocities that are committed by them and our enemies. And you posit, in fact
you say in the Massey Lectures, that there's a test of integrity and moral
honesty which is to have a kind of equality of treatment of corpses.

<TR VALIGN = TOP><TD ALIGN = left><B>NC: </B><TD ALIGN = left>Equality of
principles . . . 

<TR VALIGN = TOP><TD ALIGN = left><B>DF: </B><TD ALIGN = left>I mean that every
dead person should be in principle equal to every other dead person.

<TR VALIGN = TOP><TD ALIGN = left><B>NC: </B><TD ALIGN = left>That's not what I
say. That's not what I say at all.

<TR VALIGN = TOP><TD ALIGN = left><B>DF: </B><TD ALIGN = left>I'm glad that's
not what you say because that's not what you do.

<TR VALIGN = TOP><TD ALIGN = left><B>NC: </B><TD ALIGN = left>Of course it's not
what I do. Nor would I say it. In fact I say the opposite. What I say is that we
should be responsible for our own actions primarily. That's something quite
different.

<TR VALIGN = TOP><TD ALIGN = left><B>PW: </B><TD ALIGN = left>But you were
equating one (Polish) [priest] to one hundred priests.<A HREF = "#note1">[1]</A>

<TR VALIGN = TOP><TD ALIGN = left><B>NC: </B><TD ALIGN = left>I wasn't equating
them. I was comparing the treatment of them. If you want my value judgement - we
should give much more attention to one priest whom we've killed than to one
hundred priests that they've killed. Notice that this is exactly the . . . 

<TR VALIGN = TOP><TD ALIGN = left><B>DF: </B><TD ALIGN = left>That's not your
method.

<TR VALIGN = TOP><TD ALIGN = left><B>NC: </B><TD ALIGN = left>That's exactly my
method.

<TR VALIGN = TOP><TD ALIGN = left><B>DF: </B><TD ALIGN = left>Because your
method is to ignore . . . not only to ignore the corpses that are created by
them, but also to ignore the corpses that are created by neither side but are
irrelevant to you're ideological . . . 

<TR VALIGN = TOP><TD ALIGN = left><B>NC: </B><TD ALIGN = left>That's totally
untrue.

<TR VALIGN = TOP><TD ALIGN = left><B>DF: </B><TD ALIGN = left>Well, let me give
you an example.

<TR VALIGN = TOP><TD ALIGN = left><B>NC: </B><TD ALIGN = left>Okay.

<TR VALIGN = TOP><TD ALIGN = left><B>DF: </B><TD ALIGN = left>One of your own
causes that you take very seriously is the cause of the Palestinians, and a
Palestinian corpse weighs very heavily on your conscience, and yet a Kurdish
corpse does not. 

<TR VALIGN = TOP><TD ALIGN = left><B>NC: </B><TD ALIGN = left>That's not true at
all. I've been involved with Kurdish support groups for years. That's absolutely
false. I mean, just ask the people who are involved - you know, they come to me,
I sign their petitions, and so on and so forth. In fact if you look at the
things we've written . . . I mean, I'm not Amnesty International, I can't do
everything, I'm a single person. But if you read, say, take a look, say, at the
book that Edward Herman and I wrote on this topic. We wrote a book about this in
1979 <A HREF = "#note2">[2]</A>. In it we discuss three kinds of atrocities, not two, three kinds of
bloodbaths. What we called benign bloodbaths - which nobody cares about,
constructive bloodbaths - which are the ones we [the U.S.] like, and nefarious bloodbaths
which are the ones that the bad guys do. Constructive bloodbaths are things like
the Indonesian massacres, which we [the U.S.] supported. Nefarious
bloodbaths are like, Pol Pot. But we also discussed ones that nobody cares
about, like Burundi. For example, we have probably the only discussion in the
literature, I guess, of the massacres that were going on in Burundi at that
time. We probably have the only discussion in the literature, at least that I
know of, of the massacres that were going on in Burma. Now, in fact, not only is
what you say not true, but it's the opposite of the truth. We went out of our
way to find the kinds of bloodbaths that are just ignored because nobody cares
about them. Now again, let me stress, I'm not Amnesty International. I do not
have the ludicrous egotism which makes me the arbiter of all atrocities over the
world. I'm not trying to give an A to this country and a B minus to this country
and so on. The principle that I think we ought to follow is not the one that you
stated, it's the principle we rightly expect Soviet dissidents to follow. What
principle do we expect Sakharov to follow, let's say? What lets us decide
whether Sakharov's a moral person? I think he is. Sakharov does not treat every
atrocity as identical. He has nothing to say about American atrocities. When
he's asked, he says I don't know anything about them, I don't care about them.
What he talks about are Soviet atrocities, and that's right. Because those are
the ones that he's responsible for. You know, it's a very simple ethical point -
you're responsible for the predictable consequences of your actions. You're not
responsible for the predictable consequences of someone else's actions. Now, we
understand this when we're talking about dissidents in the Soviet Union but we
refuse to understand it when we're talking about ourselves for very good
reasons. Commissars in the Soviet Union don't understand it about dissidents.
Commissars in the Soviet Union attack Sakharov and other dissidents because they
don't talk about American crimes. We understand exactly why that's just
hypocrisy and cynicism when they do it and we should understand the same when we
do it. Now the fact of the matter is that I spend a fair amount of effort on
crimes of official enemies. There are a fair number of people in the United
States and Canada, from the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, who are there
because of my personal activities on their behalf. But I don't take any pride in
that particularly, I just do it because I'm interested in it. The most important
thing, for me and for you, is to think about the consequences of your actions.
What can you affect? Those are the ones you primarily ought to be concerned
about. Of course every corpse is a corpse, but there are some you can affect and
there are others you can't do much about. You know, like I can be worried about
things that happened in the eighteenth century but I can't do much about them.

<TR VALIGN = TOP><TD ALIGN = left><B>PW: </B><TD ALIGN = left>It strikes me that
you're a living refutation of the thesis that you can't get a certain point of
view across. You've hardly been a shrinking violet over the past thirty years
but it seems to me the effect of your theme has been virtually zilch except for
a few of the elite who support it. It seems to me the great mass of the American
people, the workers, either don't understand it or reject it totally.

<TR VALIGN = TOP><TD ALIGN = left><B>NC: </B><TD ALIGN = left>First of all I
don't agree with your factual assumption. I think it's exactly the opposite of
the truth.

<TR VALIGN = TOP><TD ALIGN = left><B>PW: </B><TD ALIGN = left>What factual
assumption?

<TR VALIGN = TOP><TD ALIGN = left><B>NC: </B><TD ALIGN = left>What you said is .
. . you said correctly that I haven't been a shrinking violet and you said the
effect has been zilch except for elements of the elite. The facts are exactly
the opposite. The effects on the elite are zero and the effects on the general
population are not insignificant. Not just me. I'm one person. There are a lot
of people doing this sort of thing and we have much greater outreach than we've
ever had before. Not through the elite media. As I said before, I travel around
the country all the time. I can't accept a fraction of the invitations that
come. I'm booked up solidly two years in advance and I probably don't accept . .
. maybe 10% of the invitations that come in.

<TR VALIGN = TOP><TD ALIGN = left><B>PW: </B><TD ALIGN = left>I guess this works
well for you.

<TR VALIGN = TOP><TD ALIGN = left><B>NC: </B><TD ALIGN = left>But see, there's a
reason for that. That was not true twenty years ago. When I got started in this,
if I could talk to three neighbors in a living room I'd consider it a good
evening. I was giving talks on the Boston Common where we had to be protected by
the police to prevent us from being murdered. And that was going on until 1966,
and Boston is a liberal city incidentally, and this was with the support of the
media that the . . . 

<TR VALIGN = TOP><TD ALIGN = left><B>PW: </B><TD ALIGN = left>But the media
wasn't ignoring you.

<TR VALIGN = TOP><TD ALIGN = left><B>NC: </B><TD ALIGN = left>Oh, totally.
Totally. There are lots of illusions about this. In the 1960's the media were
completely closed to anybody like me. That includes National Public Radio, for
example. The most liberal segment of the American media is probably National
Public Radio in Boston, where I live and I'm not unknown. During the entire
Vietnam War, when I was very well known for opposition to the war, I was on
National Public Radio once for, I think, five minutes; if I remember, after I
came back from Vietnam, with an extremely hostile interview by the most liberal
commentator (Louie Amlient). That was it. I could never be in the newspapers or
anything of that sort. By the early 70's it began to change a little and by the
late 70's it changed more, and in the 1980's it's considerably more. I mean,
it's still very limited but if I wanted to I could probably at this point, say,
write op-eds for quality local press. Not the <TT>New York Times</TT>, but, say, the
Minneapolis Star Tribune or something. That was unimaginable in the 60's.

<TR VALIGN = TOP><TD ALIGN = left><B>PW: </B><TD ALIGN = left>But that's elite.

<TR VALIGN = TOP><TD ALIGN = left><B>NC: </B><TD ALIGN = left>It's not. That's a
reflection . . . see, I think that's missing the point. The elites are about as
closed as they always were but the general population has changed and that's
beginning to affect the institutions. I mean, outreach to the general population
is much easier than before. I gave my own experience but other people have the
same experience. You talk to much wider groups, much bigger audiences, they're
much more sophisticated. In the peak of the peace movement I was always cutting
corners. I would never say what I thought. I never talked about the U.S. attack
against South Vietnam in the 1960's even in, you know, student activist groups
because they wouldn't know what I'm talking about. And I never talked about
institutions. I never criticized . . . you know, today I talk a little about
capitalist democracy - I'd never talk about that kind of thing in the 60's, it
was just too exotic. But I don't cut any corners anymore anywhere. I can be
giving a talk in eastern Kentucky or central Iowa or something else and I say
exactly what I think and people generally understand it. They may not agree,
they may be surprised, but they want to listen and they want to think about it.
Those are changes outside of the elite circles.

<TR VALIGN = TOP><TD ALIGN = left><B>DF: </B><TD ALIGN = left>(Your)
[propaganda] model of the media <A HREF = "#note3">[3]</A> - [is one] in which
the media argue for and defend the established institutions of society and any
deviation from that defense is dismissed or even suppressed, so that views that
dissent from the overwhelming consensus that characterizes our society cannot
get a hearing. Now, here you are tonight in a large lecture hall at Canada's
most prestigious journalism school speaking to an audience of journalists who
are hearing your remarks with apparent approbation. Your remarks are being
broadcast on the government owned radio network as part of the most prestigious
lecture series on that network. How did that happen?

<TR VALIGN = TOP><TD ALIGN = left><B>NC: </B><TD ALIGN = left>Recall that what I
said was that this [the Propaganda Model] is a very good first approximation to
the description of a complex social institution. Now, you remember that I
mentioned. . . I'm afraid this remark may sound a little insulting but let me
try to say it without sounding that way. I specifically mentioned that in the
United States, for example, I wasn't talking about, say, listener supported
radio in a small community. In fact, as you get away from the elite centers that
matter things open up. Now, the fact of the matter is that Canada is a much more
open society in this respect than the United States and the reason is, it's less
important. This generalizes. I can talk this way in Belgium, in Israel, in Latin
America. I can't talk this way . . . I mean, I can talk this way in the United
States but not on national radio and television because it's just too important.
What people think about international affairs in Canada just doesn't matter that
much to established power. If it did matter that much Canada would close up too.

<TR VALIGN = TOP><TD ALIGN = left><B>Mod: </B><TD ALIGN = left>If CBC then is
just a small publicly funded station in some small town . . . with the (point)
of that perspective, why don't we turn to the CBC person on stage here -
Margaret Daley, perhaps you can have a turn.

<TR VALIGN = TOP><TD ALIGN = left><B>MD: </B><TD ALIGN = left>Well, I was
intrigued by the thesis and particularly impressed by the volume of factual
documentation that I look forward to reading in the long version. I guess that
the question I want to ask though is, that given that this information exists,
you lay it all out supposing people knew it. And obviously individuals do know
it - minorities, intellectuals, foreign affairs buffs if you want to call them
that - those kinds of people can assemble all this information. Then what? It
doesn't seem to make any difference, and why is that?

<TR VALIGN = TOP><TD ALIGN = left><B>NC: </B><TD ALIGN = left>Well, I think it
does make a difference. I think it makes a lot of difference. I mentioned, not
entirely jocularly, that if a third world country today were to put forth the
American Constitution, we'd call it a reversion to nazism and I mentioned that
that's a sign of hope and progress. There has been moral progress over two
hundred years. There's also been progress over twenty years, thirty years, my
active lifetime. Again, I'm talking mostly about the United States but it's a
different country than it was twenty or thirty years ago. Now, elites are not
different, they're pretty much as indoctrinated as they always were. Contrary to
a lot of necessary illusion, elite groups including liberal intellectual elites,
did not oppose the Vietnam War. They supported the Vietnam War, supported it
enthusiastically. They began to turn against it somewhat after Wall Street
turned against it and more or less for the same reasons - because it was too
costly. The media were almost totally closed to critics of the war. But among
the general population this crisis of democracy did take place and it changed
the society. I think it led to, probably . . . I hope, a permanent cultural
change outside the elite centers. And the United States is just a different
country than it was twenty years ago in a lot of respects. Everything from
interpersonal relations, to treatment of ethnic minorities, to concern over
international affairs and so on. You can see it. And the reason is . . . while
the major institutions of indoctrination continue on their natural course, other
modes of interaction did develop and they remained. You know, they're informal,
they're inefficient . . . I mean, I spend probably 80% . . . I don't know, some
huge percent of my time traveling around the country giving talks. Well, that's
less efficient than writing for a major journal but people do this and
ultimately it makes a difference. There are solidarity groups, there are all
kinds of organizations and so on, and they do make a difference. You can see it.
So take for example . . . I mentioned the U.S. attack against South Vietnam in
the early 1960's. You compare the early 1960's with the 1980's - that's twenty
years. When Ronald Reagan came into office, his administration, in my view,
intended to emulate John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson, except their target was
Central America. They came out with the White Paper in February 1981 right after
they came into office - virtually a declaration of war. The communists are
taking over the world, we've got to go in there and stop them. It was a
precursor to direct U.S. military intervention in Central America. What
happened? The media, incidentally, bought the whole story. There was virtually
no criticism of the White Paper when it came out - just enthusiastic support for
it. However, the general population didn't [support the White Paper] because the
population is not what it was in the early 60's. <A HREF = "#note4">[4]</A> When John F. Kennedy started
sending the American Air Force to bomb South Vietnam on a regular basis there
was no protest. You couldn't get two people together in a living room to talk
about it. And it didn't have to be hidden either - it was on the front page of
the newspapers. Nobody cared - we want to bomb another country, great, let's go
on to the next thing. When Ronald Reagan's administration sort of indicated that
they might try to turn to direct military intervention there was a convulsion in
the country. People started coming out of the woodwork. It ranged from a massive
flow of letters to Washington, to demonstrations, to church groups getting
involved. A whole array of protest began to develop spontaneously without any
organization and structure. The reason is the country's just a lot different.
Well, what happened? What happened is that the Reagan administration backed off.
They in fact told the media to cool the rhetoric, to cut back the inflammatory
rhetoric. They were afraid that much more central themes of their program would
be endangered. After all, remember that they were trying to ram through a
program that the population was strongly opposed to - a domestic economic
program. They were trying to ram through destruction of the limited welfare
measures that exist in the United States - a huge transfer of resources from the
poor to the rich and massive increase in state power, and huge public subsidy to
high technology industry through the pentagon system and so on. All of these
things were contrary to what the public wanted and they didn't want any protest
about them. So what they did was back off from their inflammatory proclamations
about Central America and they went underground. That's what the Iran-Contra
hearings were about. The administration was driven underground. The domestic
population would not tolerate the activities that they wanted to carry out and
they therefore had to turn to illegal clandestine activities. Now, the Reagan
administration was notorious for the level of its clandestine activities and
clandestine activities are a pretty good measure of popular dissidence. If there
isn't any popular dissidence you don't have to carry out clandestine activities.
You can carry out overt international terrorism and violence, which is much more
efficient. Overt violence is more efficient than clandestine violence for
obvious reasons - for one thing it's just more efficient to do, and for another
thing, there isn't any risk that it will be exposed which will cause a scandal
and so on and so forth. And in fact the state was driven underground by popular
dissidence. Well, that's important. I think that's one of the many reflections
of the difference between the 1960's and the 1980's. And in fact even the media
are different. Bad as they are . . . I mean, as you can see I'm no great
enthusiast for the elite media but they're better than they were twenty years
ago. They're not as closed and restricted and constrained as they were twenty
years ago and that includes the elite media. So there are slow changes and I
think there is a slow move towards general democratization - much too slow, but
not insignificant. Those are things that first of all one can be somewhat
hopeful about, but it also teaches you a lesson - it means there are things you
can do. After all, our societies - like Canada and the United States - have one
tremendous virtue: the state is very restricted in its capacity to use force
against citizens. It's not zero, but by comparative standards it's low, and that
means there's a great range of options available if people want to make use of
them - and many do and it makes a difference.

<TR VALIGN = TOP><TD ALIGN = left><B>KM: </B><TD ALIGN = left>Many of the things
you describe about how the elite press in the United States sees the world are
replayed to us through some of the main communications links that we rely on -
such as Associated Press, Reuters News Agency, <TT>New York Times</TT> News Service. And
I think many Canadian journalists are in a position of recognizing a strong U.S.
bias in those reports and are active . . . that's one of the day to day
challenges - trying to find ways of getting around that. One of the things you
can do is get your own correspondents there who have a different point of view,
or try and get local (stringers). You can't do that all the time, but I just
wonder from that - from my point of view anyway - it seems that perhaps a lot of
what you describe could be simply interpreted as the American press playing
cheerleader for the home team. It's just like there's a kind of sports writer
who's called a homer, you know, and the home team can do no wrong. Can you look
at it that way - just as an issue of American foreign policy, and countries like
Canada can have some effective room to maneuver in terms of covering the world?

<TR VALIGN = TOP><TD ALIGN = left><B>NC: </B><TD ALIGN = left> Well, I think
there's something to that but, you know, we have to be careful about what's the
home team. I mean, for example, what the American press defends is the interests
of elite elements in the United States. Now, it may be that the general
population is strongly opposed to elite elements but they're not the home team.
It's the elite elements that are the home team, for the reasons that I
mentioned. So on, say, Central America there's no doubt that the general
population has been pretty much opposed to these policies, but the home team is
in favor of them and the press is in favor of them. Let's take Vietnam, the
Vietnam War - that was very interesting. At first the general population was
strongly in support of the war, strongly in support. But it changed. By about
1969 the population was largely opposed to the war, and on interesting grounds.
The population was opposed in principle. Again, you take a look at the Gallup
polls . . . up until today, or at least two years ago which was the last one I
saw - about 70% of the population regularly says the Vietnam War was
fundamentally wrong and immoral, not a mistake. Now, among opinion leaders it's
not 70%, it's like 40%. Opinion leaders include clergy and businessmen and so
on. When you get to the real intellectual elite, the percentage is about zero.
Even at the peak of opposition to the war, around 1970, the real intellectual
elite - as picked by various standards - was of course opposed to the war, so
was everybody including Wall Street 'cause it was just not paying any more - but
they were opposed on pragmatic grounds: it wasn't working, it was too costly,
it was maybe too bloody and so on. But fundamentally wrong and immoral - not a
mistake - that position is barely expressed in the ideological system, but it's
the position of about 70% of the population. Now, here we have a striking case
where the home team that you're working for is not the general population, it's
a very specific interest in the general population. I think that's true on a lot
of issues. Let's take, say . . . turn to a totally different question - take [a]
nuclear test ban. Just through popular grassroots organization the population
was about 75% in favor of a nuclear test ban two or three years ago. Elites were
strongly opposed to it - liberal, conservative, everyone else. They were so
strongly opposed to it that when the Soviet Union declared a unilateral test ban
the media barely covered it . . . I mean they noticed it and disparaged it and
told various lies about it - and when it was renewed it was barely even covered.
It was hardly even an issue in the elections even though 75% of the population
was in favor of it . . . had virtually no elite support except maybe an
occasional gesture. That's a very strong elite position but it's not reflecting
the general public. So I think there's something to what you say but I think one
has to be more discriminating about how to define the home team. The home team
means the people who own the country and therefore ought to govern it.

<TR VALIGN = TOP><TD ALIGN = left><B>KM: </B><TD ALIGN = left>Or the official
home team.

<TR VALIGN = TOP><TD ALIGN = left><B>NC: </B><TD ALIGN = left>Yes.

<TR VALIGN = TOP><TD ALIGN = left><B>KM: </B><TD ALIGN = left>It's my impression
that most of the population feels that it's being propagandized and they turn
more and more towards using media as strictly a source of entertainment. You
know, it's a (postmodern) idea that it doesn't really matter what they say
because they say it so stupidly that people are just consuming it for a laugh.
And I wonder if now that doesn't become more of a problem really than
propaganda. Despite the really impressive evidence that you've amassed, you
know, most people would be convinced by a couple of sentences saying we're
propagandized. So I wonder if entertainment isn't really the greater problem
now.

<TR VALIGN = TOP><TD ALIGN = left><B>NC: </B><TD ALIGN = left>Yes. I think what
you said is very important. What I've been talking about gives a kind of a
skewed picture. I maybe should have emphasized more but remember I'm talking
about the elite media. The elite media target largely educated people. They
target the political class, the more or less politically active class, a pretty
small percentage of the population - the articulate elite intellectuals. And
that's the kind of propaganda I've been talking about and that's only a small
part of the system. Things have to be done for the rest of the population too -
they have to be marginalized. But they're not going to be marginalized by
telling them lies about foreign policy because just as you say they don't
believe most of what they read. There's just a kind of a general populace
skepticism. Along with this sense that the government is run by a few big
interests looking out for themselves is the sense that the media are probably
lying to us. So for most of the population the media system is I think a
different one. It's not just the case that it tries to entertain them, it tries
to entertain them through means which will intensify attitudes that support the
interest of elites. For example . . . let me give some cases. Take the emphasis
on professional sports. It sounds harmless but it really isn't. Professional
sports are a way of building up jingoist fanaticism. You're supposed to cheer
for your home team. Just to mention something from personal experience - I
remember, very well, when I was I guess, a high school student - a sudden
revelation when I asked myself why am I cheering for my high school football
team. I don't know anybody on it, if I met anybody on it we'd probably hate each
other. You know, why do I care if they win or if some guy a couple blocks away
wins. And then you can say the same thing about the baseball team or whatever
else it is. This idea of cheering for your home team -which you mentioned before
- that's a way of building into people irrational submissiveness to power. And
it's a very dangerous thing. And I think it's one of the reasons it gets such a
huge play. Or . . . let's move to something else. The indoctrination that's done
by T.V. and so on is not trying to pile up evidence and give arguments and so
on. It's trying to inculcate attitudes. I mentioned a couple of cases but there
are a lot more. Let's take, say, the bombing of Libya. Why did the American
public support the bombing of Libya? Well, the reason is that there had been a
very effective, and careful, and intense inculcation of racist attitudes about
Arabs. Anti-Arab racism is the one form of racism in the United States that's
considered legitimate. I mean, plenty of people are racist, but you don't like
to admit it. On the other hand, with regard to anti-Arab racism you admit it
openly. You read a journal like, say, The New Republic, and the kinds of things
that they say about Arabs . . . if anyone said them about Jews you'd think you
were reading (Der Stern). I'm not joking. And nobody notices it because
anti-Arab racism is so profound. There are novels that have a form of anti-Arab
racism that's hair-raising. The same is true of television shows and so on and
so forth. An image has been created - the media are part of this, not all - of
the Arab terrorist lurking out there ready to kill us. And against that
background you could bomb Libya and people would cheer. Recall how effective
that was, remember what was happening in 1986, there are a lot of measures of
how effective this is. Remember that in 1986 when this happened the tourism
industry in Europe was virtually wiped out because Americans were afraid to go
to Europe, where incidentally, objectively, they would be about a hundred times
as safe as in any American city. That's no joke. But they were afraid to go to
Europe because they got these Arab terrorists out there trying to kill us. Now,
that was not from <TT>New York Times</TT> editorials, that was from a whole array of
television and novels and soap operas and a mass of symbolism and so on and so
forth and that's effective. The anticommunist hysteria is developed that way
too. The communists are out there ready to kill us - who are the communists? - I
don't know, they're out there ready to kill us. This is introduced by the kinds
of symbolism that T.V. is good at, and cheap novels are good at and so on and
that's important. These are critical means of indoctrination it's just that I
wasn't talking about them. I was talking about the more intellectual side.

<TR VALIGN = TOP><TD ALIGN = left><B>PW: </B><TD ALIGN = left>Your talk of the
Vietnam War, the turning against it, and you said for moral grounds because it
was an immoral war . . .

<TR VALIGN = TOP><TD ALIGN = left><B>NC: </B><TD ALIGN = left>On the [part of

<TR VALIGN = TOP><TD ALIGN = left><B>PW: </B><TD ALIGN = left>Yes, well, my view
would be that the public turned against it - regardless of the point that I

that's been unpopular?

<TR VALIGN = TOP><TD ALIGN = left><B>NC: </B><TD ALIGN = left>Well, can I give

So long as I know that we're indoctrinated.

<TR VALIGN = TOP><TD ALIGN = left><B>NC: </B><TD ALIGN = left>To decide whether
a war is a winning war or not you have to figure out first why it was fought.
Right? That's what tells you whether it was a winning war or not.

<TR VALIGN = TOP><TD ALIGN = left><B>PW: </B><TD ALIGN = left>There are a
variety of ways to tell.

<TR VALIGN = TOP><TD ALIGN = left><B>NC: </B><TD ALIGN = left>That's right,
there are a lot of ways. But one of the ways, if you're logical, is to ask what
were the goals of the war and were those goals achieved. That's the way you
decide whether a war is a winning war. Right? If we do that . . . we're not
going to do this in one second but let me again just talk methodologically
'cause there's no time to go through the whole story - you can look up the
documents. There's elaborate documentation on the background planning for the
Vietnam War, elaborate documentation on the high level planning. And the main
concern all along was that independent nationalism in Vietnam might be what was
called a rotten apple that would infect the barrel - it might have a
demonstration effect throughout the region, very much like Nicaragua. And
there's a way you deal with that. The way you deal with a virus that might
infect the region - the virus in this case being independent nationalism - the
way you deal with it is by destroying the virus and inoculating the region from
the spread. Now that was done, the Vietnam War had a dual character - you had to
destroy the possibility of independent development in Vietnam and you had to
create around it brutal military dictatorships which would prevent the spread,
and both of those things were done reasonably effectively. Part of the Vietnam
War was the support for the Indonesian massacres in 1965, a very significant
part. Part of the concern over Vietnam was that it would encourage the growth of
independent politics in Indonesia where you had a huge mass-based, peasant-based
communist party and success in Vietnam might have spurred that on. In 1965 that
party was wiped out with the slaughter of maybe 700,000 people to enthusiastic
support in the West, I should say. That was part of the inoculation of the
region - same happened in Thailand, same happened in the Philippines with the
Marcos coup, all around the region. Meanwhile, Vietnam was sufficiently
destroyed so the chances of it being a model for anyone else are very slight. I
mean, Vietnam barely survives . . . it suffered the kind of fate that there's
nothing to compare with in European history, back to the black plague. [It will]
Be a century before they even recover, if then. So that's a partial victory. You
didn't have a total victory, they didn't get their ultimate goal. If you call
success only achievement of every goal, even the minor ones, then it wasn't a
victory. But if you give an accurate assessment it was a partial victory -
partial defeat, partial victory. They didn't reabsorb Indochina back into the
American system but they prevented it from being the threat of a good example.
In this respect the American war in Nicaragua is also a partial victory. Now, we
can answer the question . . . what the American population thought about the war
- we can answer it because it's a very heavily polled population - and we don't
have to speculate, we can look at public opinion studies, and they changed over
time. By the late 60's the population was largely opposed to the war on moral
grounds, not on grounds that it was going to fail. By the 70's, with the
continued improvement in the cultural climate among the general population those
figures went up. By 1982 it was 72% answering that "the war is
fundamentally wrong and immoral not a mistake". <A HREF = "#note5">[5]</A>
And those figures are
particularly dramatic because there was virtually no articulate expression of
this view. You go to the extreme doves, you know, Anthony Lewis and so on - they
were not saying this, they never said it. What they were saying is, it's a
mistake. Some of them might have said it's too bloody. If you want some actual
evidence on this . . . don't take my word for it, go to the evidence. There is
an interesting study called "The American Intellectual Elite," <A HREF =
"#note6">[6]</A> it came out around 1974, it's done by a sociologist named
Charles [Kadushin]. It's a study of the attitudes of people called the American
intellectual elite. I agree, it's a totally idiotic concept but the people he
studied are probably no worse a sample than others. I was actually one of them,
so I sort of watched the study go on. This study was taken in May 1970 - that's
rather important. If you look back, you'll discover that that was the peak
period of opposition to the war. Right after the invasion of Cambodia - that was
the period when the colleges were closed down, the whole country was blowing up.
Right at that point this survey was taken of the American intellectual elite -
you know, the people that write for the New York Review of Books and all this
kind of fancy stuff. There were 200 people in the sample, everybody was against
the war, but so was Richard Nixon. So that didn't mean anything. The question
is, why were they against the war? Well, they broke it down into three
categories . . .most of them were against the war on what the editor called
pragmatic grounds - meaning, can't get away with it. A smaller percentage, I
forget the numbers, maybe a third or so . . . . . .

<P>Our guests are as far apart on the Contra question as American
intellectuals can be --

<P><img src="/manucon/graphics/page139a.gif" align=right vspace=10 hspace=10>
John Silber, the President of Boston University, was a member
of the Kissinger Commission that diagnosed a security threat in
Central America.

<P>Noam Chomsky, the language theorist at MIT, argues in his new
book, entitled <CITE>Turning The Tide,</CITE> that U.S. intervention
in Central America is the acute case of our general misuse and
misrule of the Third World.

<P>I would like you to begin, President Silber. Address yourself
to the waverers, if there are any, in the U.S. Senate. Why would
you vote for the Contra money?

<P><B>John Silber</B> 

<P>Well, the Senate of the United States has traditionally been in
favor of supporting democratic forces as opposed to totalitarian
forces. And if they continue that practice they are going to vote
against the Sandinistas and they are going to vote in favor of
the Contras. On October 15 the Sandinistas passed an edict that
suspends the protection against the search of homes without a
warrant, that suspends the privacy of mail and allows for the
censorship of mail. They suspended the right of free assembly.
They have suspended all freedom of the press. They have continued
their harassment of their people and suspended virtually all democratic
rights. The October 15 decree is much more restrictive and comprehensive
than the decree that Hitler passed on February 28, 1933, when
he ended the democratic republic of Weimar. Once you see this
totalitarian nature of the regime, which was apparent since 1979
in September, and has continued ever since then, it is time for
the Senate of the United States to support the Democrats.

<P><B>Lydon</B> 

<P>Noam Chomsky, in a short speech to the U.S. Senate, why would
you be agin [<I>sic</I>] the Contra money?

<P><B>Noam Chomsky</B> 

<P>Well, as even the most ardent supporters of the Contras now concede,
this is what they call a proxy army which is attacking Nicaragua
from foreign bases, is entirely dependent on its masters for directions
and support, has never put forth a political program, has created
no base of political support within the country, and almost its
entire top military command is Somozist officers. Its military
achievements so far consist of a long and horrifying series of
very well documented torture, mutilation and atrocities, and essentially
nothing else. Administration officials are now openly conceding
in public that the main function of the Contras is to retard or
reverse the rate of social reform in Nicaragua and to try to terminate
the openness of that society. The state of siege, for example,
which was imposed last fall, and which is very mild, I should
say -- there is much political opening in Nicaragua, as everyone
there up to the American ambassador will tell you -- that corresponds
roughly to the state of siege which has been in place in El Salvador
since early 1980, except in El Salvador it has been associated
with a huge massacre of tens of thousands of people. Destruction
of the press, so on and so forth. Whereas in Nicaragua it is a
reaction to a war that we are carrying out against them with precisely
the purpose of trying to retard social reform and to restrict
the possibilities of an open and developing society. That is a
cruel and savage policy, which we should terminate.

<P><B>Silber</B> 

<P><img src="/manucon/graphics/page141a.gif" align=right vspace=10 hspace=10>
Are you going to continue that series of plain falsehoods? That's
a series of falsehoods the likes of which I've never seen compacted
in such a small period of time. The massacres that have occurred
in Nicaragua have been the massacres by the Sandinistas of the
Miskito Indians. The repression there is massive. It is more serious
than anything we have seen in Central America or in any Latin
American country to date. It is a genuine dictatorship imposed
there. And to describe the leaders of the Contras as being supporters
of Somoza is simply fabrication. Robelo, Cruz, Calero, Chamorro
are not Somozistas and never have been. And when you take the
leadership of the army of the Contras -- some of them were members
of the National Guard -- but then if you are going to object to that,
which would be highly unreasonable because that was an army that
was not simply followers, or Somozistas, it is important to remember
that Modesta Rojas, the vice chairman of the air force of the
Sandinistas, was also a member of the National Guard and a very
large number of members of the National Guard are the ones who
are coordinators of the block committees that imposed the dictatorship
by the Sandinistas. This is a series of distortions and fabrications
and the effort of the Sandinistas to discredit the Contras by
the manufacture of atrocities is now a point that has been very
well documented.

original picture of the totalitarian...

<P><B>Chomsky</B> 

<P>...Let's just first start by talking about the facts. I stated again
that the military leadership of the Contras is almost entirely
drawn from the top, from the Somozist National Guard.

<P>...and that is he knows what the truth is and he doesn't want me
to...

<P><B>Silber</B> 

<P>...no no no, it's because you have distorted the truth long enough.

<P><B>Chomsky</B> 

<P>May I have a chance to say what...

<P><B>Silber</B> 

<P>
...No just let me finish. It is Marcos, Marcos is the very army
that helped Aquino into power so when you try to take on the National
Guard, as if the National Guard was Somozistas, you misstate the
case.

<P><B>Lydon</B> 

<P>...But let him make the case. It's...

<P><B>Silber</B> 

<P>...You also overlook the fact that there are plenty of National
Guard members who are supporting the Sandinistas.

<P><B>Lydon</B> 

<P>Mr. Chomsky...

<P><B>Silber</B> 

<P>Now you go ahead and distort the truth again.

<P><B>Chomsky</B> 

<P>Now let me, see, here you're having an action. A good example
of totalitarianism, and that is to ensure that the opposition...

<P><B>Silber</B> 

<P>I'm the first one that stopped your monopoly on misinformation.

<P><B>Chomsky</B> 

<P>The idea that I have a monopoly of misinformation of the American
press is a little ridiculous.

<P><B>Silber</B> 

<P>No it's not...

<P><B>Chomsky</B> 

<P>Really? I control the American press? Let me repeat. Let's go
back to the facts: forty-six out of the forty-eight of top military
commanders of the Contras are Somozist officers. You can find
that in the Congressional report. You can find that from Edgar
Chamorro who is the CIA appointed spokesman. That's exactly what
I said and it's exactly true. As to the idea that the Sandinistas
have carried out massacres on a par with those that we have been
carrying out in Central America, this is really astonishing!

<P>In El Salvador, the number of people massacred since 1978 or since
1979 when we moved in in force is on the order of sixty-thousand.
In Guatemala, where we incidentally have been supporting it all
the way through with military aid which never terminated and are
now supporting it enthusiastically, the number of people massacred
is on the order of a hundred thousand.

<P>Mr. Silber referred to the Miskito indians, who were badly treated,
I should say, the figures are that approximately sixty or seventy
were killed. Whereas in contrast, about five or six thousand people
have been killed -- and I don't mean killed, this is not your garden
variety killing; this is torture, murder and mutilation, massively
documented in great detail -- by our forces. Now there are crimes
of the Sandinistas, there is no doubt, but they are undetectable
in comparison with the crimes that we have supported...

<P><B>Lydon</B> 

<P>I'd like to go back to two central arguments this thing turns
on. One is that Sandinista Nicaragua poses a security threat to
the United States and to this hemisphere. Secondly, we owe it
to the so-called democrats and the democratic notion to help people
who are carrying our standard in the region. John Silber, are
these equal arguments and do you support them both?

<P><B>Silber</B> 

<P>Well, I don't support the presence of about sixty-five hundred
Soviet and Cuban troops in Nicaragua. I don't support the presence
of twenty-four armed helicopter gunships supplied by the Soviet
Union to Nicaragua, or a hundred and fifty battle tanks or about
twelve hundred trucks and three hundred-

<P><B>Lydon</B> 

<P>...But where is the notion that it is a security threat to this
country?

<P><B>Silber</B> 

<P>Well, it's not a security threat yet. And neither was Hitler a
security threat when he suspended all freedoms of the Germans
on February 28, 1933. He wasn't even a security threat that was
serious in 1936 when he re-armed the Rhineland. But by the time
that the Allies got around to recognizing that he was a threat
it cost us tens of millions of lives and it took six years in
which to defeat him.

<P><img src="/manucon/graphics/page143a.gif" align=left vspace=10 hspace=10>
Now, at the present time we can put an end to the Sandinista dictatorship
in Central America without using a single American life. All we
have to do is help pay for the firemen. There is a fire going
on down there. We don't have to put the fire out. But we're asked
to pay for the firemen. If we wait, if we decide to do nothing
until the Soviets establish a land base there and it develops,
as it will develop if we allow it to happen, we will then have
to face the fact of a possibility of war. It is not a present
threat, it is a vector. If people don't have sense enough to understand
that a small fire in a room is a threat, not because it's a small
fire but because small fires have a way of becoming big fires,
then we haven't learned anything from history.

<P><B>Lydon</B> 

<P>It's Noam Chomsky's turn on the question of the security threat
to the hemisphere and to this country.

<P><B>Chomsky</B> 

<P>Well, to talk of Nicaragua as a security threat is a bit like
asking what threat Luxembourg poses to the Soviet Union. Mr. Silber
mentioned Hitler and I am old enough to remember Hitler's speeches
in which he talked about the threat to Germany posed by Poland
from which Germany had to defend itself. And even that's unfair
to Hitler to draw that example. It is quite true that Nicaragua
is now Soviet-armed and heavily armed. And the reason is that
it is being attacked by a superpower which has specifically blocked
every other source of supply. For example, up until the May embargo
last year twenty percent of Nicaraguan trade was with the Soviet
bloc. Prior to that, its arms were coming from everywhere. We
then blocked the arms from everywhere else. As we intensified
the war, they do exactly what the U.S. government wants them to
do; namely, to divert resources from the social reforms which
we really fear, and they turn them towards militarization. The
idea that Nicaragua could attack -- I might add that the countries
of Latin America regard this as hysterical lunacy. Every country,
all the Contadora countries, all the support countries which include
all of the relatively democratic countries in Latin America, are
pleading with us to call off the war against the country. They
understand perfectly well exactly what it's doing. It's forcing
them to be a militarized state and it's creating a danger of a
wider war in the region. If we want to get the Soviet tanks out
of Nicaragua, and there are very few, and the Cuban advisors out,
what we should do is very simple and everyone in the government
knows it. Call off the war and they will return to what they were
doing before we attacked them; namely creating the most effective
reforms in the hemisphere, which were widely praised by the World
Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, organizations like
OXFAM, which described them as unique in their experience in seventy-six
developing countries...

<P><B>Lydon</B> 

<P>We're running out-

<P><B>Chomsky</B> 

<P>...which we have retarded and stopped by this attack.

<P><B>Lydon</B> 

<P>We are running so far overtime that we might just as well keep
going. I want you to deal with the question of democracy and our
responsibility to aid the cause. You criticized the Sandinistas
but do you really want to embrace the Contras as a vehicle of
democracy?

<P><B>Silber</B> 

<P>Absolutely. And let's dispense with the myth somehow that these
were lovely democrats until we drove them into the hands of the
Soviet Union by our opposition. That is a myth. That is a fabrication
of history that Mr. Chomsky knows is false. As a matter of fact,
when the revolution came to an end in July of 1979 the Sandinistas
came to Washington, after having pledged to the Organization of
American States that they would hold free elections. They then
received $117 million in loans, they received credit from the
World Bank through the intercession of the United States. They
were very well received and very well treated. And on September
of 193-ah, 1979, they already began their process of repression.
So the notion that we drove them into the hands of the Communists
is utterly false. It's a fabrication.

<P><B>Lydon</B> 

<P>But the question is: are the Contras a vehicle for democracy?

<P><B>Silber</B> 

<P>The Contras do not have overt support among the Nicaraguan, people
at the present time inside Nicaragua, for one obvious reason.
Hitler's opponents did not have any obvious support in Germany
after Hitler had taken over that country. In a totalitarian state
the opposition does not have any effective voice. You don't find
that effective voice in the Soviet Union now either. You have
isolated groups of refusniks. But in Nicaragua you have a leadership:
Robelo, Cruz, Chamorro, Colero-those are major figures, major
democratic figures who opposed Somoza, and many of them went to
jail and they are literally followed by thousands of people who
are opposing the Sandinista dictatorship. To try to write these
people off as totalitarian and to come up with that trumped-up
nonsense about the atrocities that those people have committed
is just a good example of doublethink. This is just a 1984 exercise
by Mr. Chomsky for which he has already established a worldwide
reputation. It's rubbish.

<P><B>Lydon</B> 

<P>Mr. Chomsky, when you hear this call to come to the rescue of
democracy and democratic forces, what do you answer?

<P><B>Chomsky</B> 

<P>I would be delighted if the United States were to reverse its
longstanding policies of opposing democratic forces throughout
Central America and begin to support those forces.

<P>Now, to return to Nicaragua and to return to the real world, I
never described the Sandinistas as perfect democrats or whatever
your phrase was. What I did was quote the World Bank, OXFAM, the
Jesuit Order and others who recognize that what they were doing
was to use the meager resources of that country for the benefit
of the poor majority. That's why health standards shot up. That's
why literacy shot up. That's why agrarian reform proceeded, the
only place in the region. That's why subsistence agriculture improved
and consumption of food increased and that's why we attacked them.
It had nothing to do with democracy.

<P>Now, I also did not say that Cruz and Robelo committed atrocities.
In fact, Cruz and Robelo sit in Washington and don't do anything.
They are figureheads who we concocted. The people who commit atrocities
are the Contra forces led by the National Guard. And of all the
figures you mention, one is involved: namely, Colero, who is an
ultra-right-wing businessman and represents the extremist, narrow
business forces in Nicaragua.

<P>Now, if we had the slightest concern with democracy -- which we do
not in our foreign affairs and never have -- we would turn to countries
where we have influence, like El Salvador. Now, in El Salvador
they don't call the archbishop bad names; what they do is murder
him. They do not censor the press; they wipe the press out. They
sent the army in to blow up the church radio station. The editor
of the independent newspaper was found in a ditch mutilated and
cut to pieces with a machete.

<P><B>Silber</B> 

<P>Don't you ever -

<P><B>Chomsky</B> 

<P>...May I continue? I did not interrupt you...

<P><B>Silber</B> 

<P>Don't you ever want to put a time value on anything you say...

<P><B>Chomsky </B>

<P>Excuse me, that was 19...

<P><B>Silber</B> 

<P>...Or do you just want to lie systematically on television?

<P><B>Chomsky</B> 

<P>I'm talking about...I'm talking about...I'm talking about 198...

<P><B>Silber</B> 

<P>...You are a systematic liar...

<P><B>Chomsky</B> 

<P>...Did these things happen or didn't they?

<P><B>Silber</B> 

<P>These things did not happen in the context in which you suggest
at all.

<P><B>Chomsky</B> 

<P>...Really?

<P><B>Silber</B> 

<P>...And when you suggest that Cruz is simply a figurehead and does
nothing, you overlook the fact that Arturo Cruz was the Ambassador
of the Sandinistas to the United States.

<P><B>Chomsky</B> 

<P>Yes, and he has always...

<P><B>Silber</B> 

<P>And he was the head banker of the Sandinistas...

<P><B>Chomsky</B> 

<P>Exactly -- in the United States

<P><B>Silber</B> 

<P>...until he finally broke with them when he found out that they
were utterly totalitarian. You are a phony, mister, and it's
time that the people read you correctly.

<P><B>Chomsky</B> 
<P>Well, it's clear why you want to divert me from the discussion...

<P><B>Silber</B> 

<P>No, it's not. It's because we get tired of rubbish!

<P><B>Chomsky</B> 

<P>Excuse me. Arturo Cruz, exactly as I said, was in the United States,
he was brought to...

<P><B>Silber</B> 

<P>Why was he in the United States?

<P><B>Chomsky</B> 

<P>He was in the United States and he defected in the United States.
He was brought back to Nicaragua, as a political figure, because
the business-based opposition there had no credible candidate.
He did not participate in the elections, as he could have, in
part because...

<P><B>Silber</B> 

<P>...he couldn't because he was broke...

<P><B>Chomsky</B> 

<P>May I continue?

<P><B>Silber</B> 

<P>No, because you're lying again.

<P><B>Lydon</B> 

<P>I've got to cut you both off.

<P><B>Chomsky</B> 

<P>I didn't say anything yet.

<P><B>Silber</B> 

<P>The Turbas [pro-Sandinista street militia] were the ones who prevented
Cruz from participating in the elections...

<P><B>Chomsky</B> 

<P>That's another fabrication. But let's continue with...

<P><B>Lydon</B> 

<P>Except we can't. I'm afraid we're out of time. You've given President
Reagan a tough act to follow on Sunday night. We thank you both,
John Silber and Noam Chomsky.

<P><B>Chomsky</B> 

<P>Yeah, OK.

<HR SIZE=3>

<H4>The following are supplemental excerpts from related works by Chomsky.</H4>

<P>The fall of [Nicaraguan dictator] Somoza in 1979 aroused
fears in Washington that the brutal dictator of El Salvador might
be overthrown, leading to loss of U.S. control there as well.
The second and still more threatening development was the growth
of "popular organizations" in the 1970s: Bible study
groups that became self-help groups under Church sponsorship,
peasant organizations, unions and the like. There was a fearsome
prospect that El Salvador might move towards a meaningful democracy
with opportunities for real popular participation in the political
process....

<P>The Carter Administration reacted to these threats in El Salvador
by backing a coup led by reformist military officers in October
1979, while ensuring that the most reactionary military elements
retained a position of dominance....

<P>In February 1980, Archbishop Romero pleaded with President Carter
not to provide the junta with military aid, which, he observed,
"will surely increase injustice here and sharpen the repression
that has been unleashed against the people's organizations fighting
to defend their most fundamental human rights"....

<P>But increasing the repression, destroying the people's organizations
and preventing independence were the very essence of U.S. policy,
so Carter ignored the Archbishop's plea and sent the aid, to "strengthen
the army's key role in reforms"....

<P>In March 1980, Archbishop Romero was assassinated. A judicial
investigation was initiated, headed by Judge Atilio Ram&iacute;rez.
He accused General Medrano, the death squad organizer and U.S.
favorite, and rightwing leader Roberto d'Aubuisson of hiring the
assassins, and shortly after fled the country after death threats
and an attempt on his life.... Judge Ram&iacute;rez concludes
that "it is undoubtedly the case that from the very beginning,
they were involved in a kind of conspiracy to cover up the murder...."

<P>In June, the university was shut down after an army attack that
left many killed, including the rector, and facilities looted
and destroyed....

<P>Meanwhile, the independent media were eliminated by bombings and
terror, another prerequisite for "free elections" to
legitimate the client regime. The editor and a journalist [of
<CITE>La Cr&oacute;nica del Pueblo</CITE>] were found with their bodies
hacked to pieces with machetes, and [<CITE>El Independiente</CITE>]
closed after three attempts to assassinate the editor, threats
to his family, occupation of the offices by armed forces, and
the arrest and torture of staff members. The Church radio station
was repeatedly bombed, and shortly after Reagan's election, troops
occupied the Archdiocese building, destroying the radio station
and ransacking the newspaper offices....

<P>On October 26, 1980, Archbishop Romero's successor, Bishop Rivera
y Damas, condemned the armed forces "war of extermination
and genocide against a defenseless civilian population";
a few weeks later, Duarte hailed the armed forces for "valiant
service alongside the people against subversion" as he was
sworn in as civilian president of the junta.

<P><CITE>Turning the Tide,</CITE> pages 102-107

<P>...[D]uring the Salvadorian election [<CITE>The New York Times, Time,
Newsweek,</CITE> and CBS News had not] even mentioned the destruction
by physical violence and murder of <CITE>La Cr&oacute;nica</CITE> and
<CITE>El Independiente</CITE>, or the toll of murdered journalists.

<P>Christopher Hitchens<BR>
<CITE>Grand Street</CITE> Magazine, Autumn 1985
</CENTER>

<P>In his imperishable <CITE>Treatise on the Art of Political Lying,</CITE> published in 1714, Dr. John Arbuthnot laid down a standard for falsifiers and calumniators that has yet to be excelled:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Detractory or defamatory lies should not be quite opposite to the qualities the person is supposed to have. Thus it will not be found according to the sound rules of pseudology to report of a pious and religious prince that he neglects his devotions and would introduce heresy; but you may report of a merciful Prince that he has pardoned a criminal who did not deserve it.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Sixteen years ago I went to the Examination Schools at Oxford University to hear Professor Noam Chomsky deliver the John Locke Lectures. The series was chiefly concerned with modern theories of grammar, syntax, and linguistics, but Chomsky attached a condition which the syndics of the university could not easily decline. He insisted on devoting one entire, self-contained lecture to the American war in Indochina and to the collusion of "academic experts" in an enterprise which was, he maintained, debauching America even as it savaged Vietnam.

<P>Several things intrigued me about the stipulation. First, I liked the way Chomsky separated his political statement from his obligation as a guest lecturer rather than, as was and is the style at Oxford, pretending to objectivity while larding the discourse with heavily sarcastic political "pointers." There was no imported agenda of the kind one got from Hugh Trevor-Roper, Max Beloff, or John Sparrow. Second, I was impressed by his insistence, which was the inverse of the shifty practice of Tory and liberal scholars, that academics could and should have a role in political life but should state their allegiance squarely. It had, after all, been only a few months since Gilbert Ryle had told us, as we clamored about the crushing of Czechoslovakia, "What can we do? We are philosophers, not lifeboat men." That there was <I>something</I> wrong with the Rylean bleat I was certain.  What it was, I was not sure. Chomsky seemed to suggest that you need not politicize the academy in order to take a stand, but that if you did not take a stand, then you were being silent about a surreptitious politicization of it. To the hundreds of us who broke the habit of many terms and for once attended lectures consistently and on time, he seemed to have a measured, unshakable, but still passionate manner that contrasted rather well with the ardent ultraleft confusion and the creepy conservative evasions that were competing at the time.

<P>Still, Chomsky was unmistakably on the left, though he scorned the sectarians and the know-alls. In those days, also, you could read him everywhere; his name had a kind of cachet. He was interviewed with respect on television and radio, though more often abroad than in America. He was a seminal contributor to <CITE>The New York Review of Books.</CITE> His predictions about a widening of the Indochina war, and a consequent narrowing of the choices between a Sovietization of the peninsula and an utter devastation of it, now seem almost banal in their accuracy. Nineteen sixty-nine was before Nixon's "madman theory," before Kissinger's "decent interval," before the Christmas bombing, the Church Committee, the "plumbers," and all the rest of it. Tumultuous as it seemed at the time, the period in retrospect appears an age of innocence. The odd thing -- and I wonder why it didn't occur to me more forcefully then -- was that, the more Chomsky was vindicated, the less he seemed to command "respect." To the extent that I reflected about this at all, I put it down to shifts in fashion ("Chomsky? -- a sixties figure"), to the crisis undergone by many superficial antiwar commentators when the American war was succeeded by Spartan regimes (of which more later), and to the fact that Chomsky had started to criticize the Israelis, seldom a prudent course for those seeking the contemplative life.

<P>As "wound healing" went on in American society, and as we were being bidden to a new age where "self-doubt and self-criticism" were things of the past, and just as I was wondering whether one would admire an individual who had put self-doubt and self-criticism behind him, Oxford struck back at Noam Chomsky. In the 1983 <CITE>Biographical Companion to Modern Thought,</CITE> edited by Alan Bullock, there appeared a 550-word entry under Chomsky, Avram Noam. Of these 550 words, the most immediately arresting were those which maintained that he had

<BLOCKQUOTE>
forfeited authority as a political commentator by a series of actions widely regarded as ill-judged (repeated polemics minimising the Khmer Rouge atrocities in Cambodia; endorsement of a book -- which Chomsky admitted he had not read -- that denied the historical reality of the Jewish Holocaust).
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The piece was written by Geoffrey Sampson, an academic nonentity who made various other incautious allegations and who later, while engaged in an exchange with my friend Alexander Cockburn [<CITE>The Nation,</CITE> December 22, 1984, and March 2, 1985], strolled into the propellers and was distributed into such fine particles that he has never been heard from again.

<P>Elsewhere in his entry, Sampson alluded foolishly to "relationships between the academic and political sides of Chomsky's thought," going so far as to say that "Chomsky has sometimes made such links explicit, for instance in arguing that Lockean empiricist philosophy paved the way for imperialism," and concluding lamely that "recently, however, Chomsky has insisted on a rigid separation between the two aspects of his work." This, insofar as it was not a simple-minded non sequitur, I knew to be flatly untrue from my attendance at the John Locke Lectures in 1969. In a 1985 article in <CITE>The New Criterion,</CITE> Sampson made an equally false claim about threats of legal action against his person from Chomsky, succeeded in convincing only its editor, the too-credulous Hilton Kramer, and the undiscriminating Martin Peretz, of <CITE>The New Republic,</CITE> of his veracity, was made to apologize by Cockburn, and, as I said, disappeared like breath off a razor blade.

<P>My curiosity was ignited, not at first by the debate over the integrity of the Bullock crib, but by the fact that anything so cavalier and crude had been published at all. Bullock and his deputies are nothing if not respecters of persons. And we live in a world where fact checkers, subeditors, and (except for people like Chomsky, who eschew them on principle) libel lawyers work mightily to protect reputations on both sides of the Atlantic. How came it that Noam Chomsky, among the few Americans of his generation to lay claim to the title of original thinker, could be treated in such an offhand way? As I later found, Chomsky had written to a stoically indifferent Bullock:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
If you would have the time or interest to look into the matter, I would be intrigued to hear your opinion about what the reaction would be under the circumstance that such scurrilous lies were to appear in a biographical dictionary -- or were to be published in a book by a reputable publisher such as Oxford or Fontana -- about a person who is not known as a political dissident.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>All this began to interest me at about the turn of the New Year. In the following weeks, without even trying, I was able to glean the following merely from the journals and papers to which I subscribe in the ordinary way:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
As the Khmer Rouge were about to take over, Noam Chomsky wrote that their advent heralded a Cambodian liberation, "a new era of economic development and social justice. " (David Horowitz and Peter Collier, <CITE>The Washington Post Sunday Magazine,</CITE> April 8, 1985)

<P>To justify his assertion that American political science is corrupt (a very serious charge), he [Philip Grant] quotes from Noam Chomsky and other supporters of the North Vietnamese cause in the Vietnam war, who attacked those leaders of political science in America who were either impartial in their attitude to that war or were sympathetic to the cause of South Vietnam. (Professor Maurice Cranston, Letters, <CITE>The Times Literary Supplement</CITE> April 5, 1985)

<P>Who among them [leaders of the antiwar movement] has been willing to suggest that the murder of a million or more Cambodians by the Khmer Rouge might have been averted if American military force had not been removed from Indochina? If any of them spoke out this way, I missed it. But I did hear Noam Chomsky seek to prove the Cambodian genocide hadn't happened. (Fred Barnes, Senior Editor, <CITE>The New Republic,</CITE> April 29, 1985)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Nor was this all. Without digging very much further, I found that the London <CITE>Spectator</CITE> had just published an article by Richard West on September 29, 1984, which lustily indicted

</BLOCKQUOTE>
the Communists and their apologists in the West like the odious Noam Chomsky. When Vietnam invaded Cambodia and let the world see the proof and magnitude of the Khmer Rouge crime, the Chomskys were able to turn to <CITE>Sideshow</CITE> for an explanation: the Khmer Rouge were the creation of Nixon and Kissinger. The atrocities in Cambodia were used to justify not only the Vietnamese invasion but their remaining as an occupying power.

<P>This comment appeared in a review of <CITE>The Quality of Mercy,</CITE> which, like <CITE>Sideshow,</CITE> was written by William Shawcross. On page 55 of <CITE>The Quality of Mercy,</CITE> which was published in the fall of 1984, appears the following, as an explanation of relative Western indifference toward the Calvary in Cambodia. Of the assumed indifference, Shawcross wrote:

</BLOCKQUOTE>
Through 1976 and 1977 and especially in 1978 the Western press's coverage of Cambodia increased. Nonetheless, the issue never reached critical mass. I did not write enough myself. And there was no broadly based campaign of protest in the West as there was, say, over abuses of human rights in Chile.

<P>One reason for this was the skepticism (to use a mild word) displayed by the Western left toward the stories coming out of Democratic Kampuchea. That skepticism was most fervently and frequently expressed by Noam Chomsky, the linguistic philosopher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He asserted that from the moment of the Khmer Rouge victory in 1975 the Western press collaborated with Western and anti-Communist Asian governments, notably Thailand, to produce a vast and unprecedented" campaign of propaganda against the Khmer Rouge.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>It seems that Chomsky is impaled on some kind of inquisitorial fork here. He is accused of leaning on Shawcross, who in turn accuses him of culpable complacency, if not outright intellectual complicity. Then there is the bland assertion by the editors of <CITE>The New Republic,</CITE> on December 24, 1984:

</BLOCKQUOTE>
This is also a very old controversy, which Mr. Chomsky has sought to confuse over the years by tossing adjectives like "brazen" and "scurrilous" at critics who recognize both Pol Pot's crimes and the efforts to whitewash the Nazi genocide for what they are.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>After reading which, Martin Peretz's flat assertion earlier that "Noam Chomsky's views are quite mad" seems a mere grace note. Reaching for the denunciation of last resort, Peretz yelled that "even in circles which had once revered him, Mr. Chomsky is now seen as a crank and an embarrassment."

<P>As I said, I found all these references with no more effort than it takes to keep up with he weeklies. And I can count William Shawcross and Richard West among my friends, <CITE>The Spectator</CITE> and <CITE>The Times Literary Supplement</CITE> among my employers, David Horowitz and Fred Barnes among my distant nodding acquaintances. No real "research," in other words. was needed to amass these confident citations. But a little work was required to establish a small fact. Not one of the extracts quoted above, whether you take them "in their context" or out of it, contains any approximation to the truth. I lay down my pen and look at what I have just written. Have I the blind spot or have they? Have I discounted enough for my own prejudices? Should I say here that Noam Chomsky once gave a book of mine a very decent review? That I have met him three times and found him sane? All these allowances made, I still maintain that we are in the territory so deftly mapped by Dr. Arbuthnot -- and by Ryszard Kapuscinski in <CITE>Shah of Shahs;</CITE>

What should one write to ruin an adversary? The best thing is to prove that he is not one of us -- the stranger, alien, foreigner. To this end we create the category of the true family.  We here, you and I, the authorities, are a true family. We live in unity, among our own kind. We have the same roof over our heads, we sit at the same table, we know how to get along with each other, how to help each other out. Unfortunately, we are not alone.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The gravamen of the bill against Noam Chomsky is this. That, <I>first,</I> he did euphemize and minimize the horrors of the Khmer Rouge. That, <I>second,</I> he did "endorse" or otherwise recommend a pamphlet or paper that sought to prove the Nazi Holocaust a fiction. That, <I>third,</I> he is an enemy of the Jewish state and a friend to footpads and terrorists of every stripe. This is what "everybody" knows about the lonely, derided linguist who no doubt blames America first and is a self-hating Jew into the bargain. Never was an open society better insulated from dissent. In Britain, he would be dismissed as "brilliant but unsound; doesn't know when to stop." In the United States, it takes a little more than that to encompass the destruction of a reputation.

<P>The best procedure must be the tedious one: to take the accusations in order, and to put them at their strongest. Let me arrange them as did Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, with the suspicions uppermost.


<A NAME="cambodia"><P><H3>The Case of the Cambodian Genocide</H3></A>

<P>David Horowitz and Peter Collier were wrong, in the syndicated article announcing their joint conversion to neoconservatism, to say that Chomsky hailed the advent of the Khmer Rouge as "a new era of economic development and social justice." The Khmer Rouge took power in 1975. In 1972, Chomsky wrote an introduction to Dr. Malcolm Caldwell's collection of interviews with Prince Norodom Sihanouk. In this introduction, he expressed not the prediction but the pious hope that Sihanouk and his supporters might preserve Cambodia for "a new era of economic development and social justice." You could say that this was naive of Chomsky, who did not predict the 1973 carpet-bombing campaign or the resultant rise of a primitive, chauvinist guerrilla movement. But any irony here would appear to be at the expense of Horowitz and Collier. And the funny thing is that, if they had the words right, they must have had access to the book. And if they had access to the book.... Well, many things are forgiven those who see the error of their formerly radical ways.

<P>The Richard West-William Shawcross fork also proves, on investigation, to be blunt in both prongs. Chomsky and Shawcross have this much in common: that they both argue for and demonstrate the connection between the Nixon-Kissinger bombing and derangement of Cambodian society and the nascence of the Khmer Rouge. It is not the case that Chomsky borrowed this idea from Shawcross, however. He first went to press on the point in 1972, seven years before <CITE>Sideshow</CITE> was published, with an account supplied by the American correspondent Richard Dudman of the <CITE>St. Louis Post-Dispatch.</CITE> Dudman is one of the few people to have been both a prisoner of the Khmer Rouge and a chronicler of his own detention. His testimony indicated a strong connection between American tactics in the countryside of Cambodia and the recruitment of peasants to the guerrilla side. (Imagine the strain of composing an account that denied such a connection.)

<P>This more or less disposes of West, who has simply got the order of things the wrong way about and added some random insults. The case of Shawcross is more complicated. In his <CITE>The Quality of Mercy,</CITE> he quotes three full paragraphs apparently from Chomsky's pen, though he does not give a source. The three paragraphs do not express "skepticism" about the massacres in Cambodia, but they do express reservations about some of the accounts of them. They also argue that the advent of the Khmer Rouge should be seen in the historical context of the much less ballyhooed American aerial massacres a few years earlier -- a point which the author of <CITE>Sideshow</CITE> is in a weak position to scorn. Finally, the three paragraphs convey a sardonic attitude toward those who claim that it "took courage" to mention the Khmer Rouge atrocities at all.

<P>But mark the sequel. The three paragraphs as quoted do not appear anywhere. They are rudely carpentered together, without any ellipses to indicate gaps in the attribution, from the summary and introduction to Volume 1 of <CITE>The Political Economy of Human Rights,</CITE> which was written by Noam Chomsky and Professor Edward Herman of the Wharton School of Business. The book went to press in 1979, <I>after</I> the forcible overthrow of the Pol Pot regime. Thus, even if the paragraphs were quoted and sourced properly, and even if they bore the construction that Shawcross puts on them, they could hardly have contributed to the alleged indifference of civilized opinion "throughout 1976 and 1977 and especially in 1978" or inhibited the issue from reaching "critical mass." Since Shawcross lists the book, with its date, in his bibliography, the discrepancy can hardly be due to ignorance.

<P>As for the gratuitous insinuation about protest over Chile, I can't help recording that one of the anti-Khmer Rouge blockbusters with which the American public was regaled came in <CITE>TV Guide</CITE> (circulation 19 million) in April 1977 and was written by Ernest Lefever. Lefever had earlier told Congress that it should be more "tolerant" of the "mistakes" of the Pinochet regime in attempting to "clear away the devastation of the Allende period." He also wrote, in <CITE>The Miami Herald,</CITE> of the "remarkable freedom of expression" enjoyed in the new Chile. In 1981, Lefever proved too farouche to secure nomination as Reagan's Under Secretary for Human Rights.

<P>William Shawcross enjoys his reputation for honesty. And so I have had to presume that his book represents his case at its most considered. Why, then, if he has room for three paragraphs from Chomsky and Herman, does he not quote the equally accessible sentences, published in <CITE>The Nation</CITE> on June 25, 1977, where they describe Father Francois Ponchaud's <CITE>Cambodia: Year Zero</CITE> as "serious and worth reading," with its "grisly account of what refugees have reported to him about the barbarity of their treatment at the hands of the Khmer Rouge"?

<P>Chomsky and Herman were engaged in the admittedly touchy business of distinguishing evidence from interpretation. They were doing so in the aftermath of a war which had featured tremendous, organized, official lying and many cynical and opportunist "bloodbath" predictions. There was and is no argument about mass murder in Cambodia: there is still argument about whether the number of deaths, and the manner in which they were inflicted, will warrant the use of the term "genocide' or even "autogenocide." Shawcross pays an implicit homage to this distinction, a few pages later, when he admits that Jean Lacouture, in his first "emotional" review of Father Ponchaud, greatly exaggerated the real number of Khmer Rouge executions. These errors, writes Shawcross, "were seized upon by Noam Chomsky, who circulated them widely. In a subsequent issue of <CITE>The New York Review,</CITE> Lacouture corrected himself. Not all of those who had reported his mea culpa published his corrections. Chomsky used the affair as part of his argument that the media were embarked on an unjustified blitz against the Khmer Rouge."

<P>If this paragraph has any internal coherence -- and I have given it in its entirety -- it must lead the reader to suppose that Chomsky publicized Lacoutre's mea culpa without acknowledging his corrections. But in <CITE>The Political Economy of Human Rights</CITE> there is an exhaustive presentation of the evolution of Lacoutre's position, including both his mea culpa and his corrections and adding some complimentary remarks about his work.  Incidentally, Lacouture reduced his own estimate of deaths from "two million" to "thousands or hundreds of thousands." Is this, too, "minimization of atrocities"?

<P>Ironies here accumulate at the expense of Chomsky's accusers. A close analysis of <CITE>Problems of Communism</CITE> and of the findings of State Department intelligence and many very conservative Asia specialists will yield a figure of deaths in the high hundreds of thousands. Exorbitant figures (i.e. those oscillating between two and three million) are current partly because Radio Moscow and Radio Hanoi now feel free to denounce the Pol Pot forces (which now, incredibly, receive official American recognition) in the most abandoned fashion. Chomsky wrote that, while the Vietnamese invasion and occupation could be understood, it could not be justified. May we imagine what might be said about his complicity with Soviet-bloc propaganda if he were now insisting on the higher figure? For both of these failures to conform, he has been assailed by Leopold Labedz in <CITE>Encounter,</CITE> who insists on three million as a sort of loyalty test, but, since that magazine shows a distinct reluctance to correct the untruths it publishes -- as I can testify from my own experience -- its readers have not been exposed to a reply.

<P>Chomsky and Herman wrote that "the record of atrocities in Cambodia is substantial and often gruesome." They even said, "When the facts are in, it may turn out that the more extreme condemnations were in fact correct." The facts are now more or less in, and it turns out that the two independent writers were as close to the truth as most, and closer than some. It may be distasteful, even indecent, to argue over "body counts," whether the bodies are Armenian, Jewish, Cambodian, or (to take a case where Chomsky and Herman were effectively alone in their research and their condemnation) Timorese. But the count must be done, and done seriously, if later generations are not to doubt the whole slaughter on the basis of provable exaggerations or inventions.

<P>Maurice Cranston's letter to <CITE>The Times Literary Supplement,</CITE> with its unexamined assumption that Chomsky was a partisan of North Vietnam, falls apart with even less examination. In 1970, Chomsky wrote up his tour of the region for <CITE>The New York Review of Books</CITE> and said:

</BLOCKQUOTE>
It is conceivable that the United States may be able to break the will of the popular movements in the surrounding countries, perhaps even destroy the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, by employing the vast resources of violence and terror at its disposal. If so, it will create a situation in which, indeed, North Vietnam will necessarily dominate Indochina, for no other viable society will remain.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>I think of that article whenever I read wised-up Western newsmen who dwell upon the "ironic" fact that the North Vietnamese, not the NLF, now hold power in Ho Chi Minh City. It takes real ingenuity to blame this on the antiwar movement, but, with a little creative amnesia and a large helping of self-pity for the wounds inflicted by the war (on America), the job can by plausibly done.

<P>Finally, to Fred Barnes, recruited to <CITE>The New Republic</CITE> from <CITE>The Baltimore Sun</CITE> and <CITE>The American Spectator.</CITE> I wrote to him on the day that his article appeared, asking to know where he heard Chomsky say such a thing. I received no reply until I was able to ask for it in person two months later. I then asked him to place it in writing. It read as follows:

</BLOCKQUOTE>
I sat next to Noam Chomsky at a seminar at Lippmann House (of the Nieman Foundation) of Harvard University in Cambridge, Mass., in 1978. On the matter of Genocide in Cambodia, the thrust of what he said was that there was no evidence of mass murder there.  As I recall, he was rather adamant on the point. He had, by this time, I believe, written a letter or two to <CITE>The New York Review of Books</CITE> making the same point. Chomsky seemed to believe that tales of holocaust in Cambodia were so much propaganda. He said, on another point, that there was an effort underway to rewrite the history of the Indochinese war -- in a way more favorable to the U.S. Perhaps he thought the notion of genocide in Cambodia was part of that effort.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Since this meeting took place in the year after Chomsky and Herman had written their <CITE>Nation</CITE> article, and in the year when they were preparing <CITE>The Political Economy of Human Rights,</CITE> we can probably trust the documented record at least as much as Mr. Barnes's recollection. And there was no letter from Chomsky about Cambodia in <CITE>The New York Review of Books.</CITE> It is interesting, and perhaps suggestive, that Barnes uses the terms "genocide," "holocaust," and "mass murder" as if they were interchangeable.  His last two sentences demonstrate just the sort of cuteness for which his magazine is becoming famous.

<P>Here is the story, as far as I can trace it, of Chomsky's effort to "minimize" or "deny" the harvest of the Khmer Rouge. It will be seen that the phony "credibility" of the charge against him derives from his <I>lack</I> of gullibility about the American mass killings in Indochina (routinely euphemized or concealed by large sections of the domestic intelligentsia). From this arises the idea that Chomsky <I>might</I> have said such things; was the sort of person who <I>could</I> decline to criticize "the other side"; was a well-known political extremist. Couple this with the slothful ease of the accusation, the reluctance of certain authors to prove they are not unpatriotic dupes, and you have a scapegoat in the making. Dr. Arbuthnot was right. Nobody would believe that Chomsky advocated a massacre. But they might be brought to believe that he excused or overlooked one.


<A NAME="faurisson"><P><H3>The Case of the Negated Holocaust</H3></A>

<P>Here, Dr. Arbuthnot gives way to Ryszard Kapuscinski. The tactic is not to circulate a part-untruth so much as it is to associate the victim with an unpardonable out-group, against which preexisting revulsion and contempt can be mobilized.

<P>My tutor at Oxford was Dr. Steven Lukes, a brilliant and humane man with an equal commitment to scholarship and to liberty. His books on Durkheim, on power, on utopianism, and on Marxism and morality are, as people tend to say, landmarks in their field. He took me as his guest to one of Chomsky's private seminars in that spring of 1969. When, in 1980, he told me that Chomsky had written an introduction to a book by a Nazi apologist, and that the book described the extermination of the Jews as a Zionist lie, I was thunderstruck. Like Noam Chomsky, Steven Lukes is Jewish. Like Chomsky, he was and is much opposed to the usurpation of Israel by the heirs of Jabotinsky. But this seemed incomprehensible. The political rights of hateful persons was one question (rather a vexed one in the British case, where the police and not the courts usually decide who may or may not speak in public), but keeping company with them was quite another. More, it appeared that Chomsky had dignified this character's book with a preface and had not even bothered to read the text he was decorating. I admit that I allowed myself a reflection or two about the potentially harmful effects on Chomsky of his political and personal isolation on the Middle East.

<P>When I began to write this article, I wrote to Lukes at Balliol and asked him to furnish me with the background material to <I>l'affaire</I> Faurisson. I also pursued all the other references in print. I do not read French very well, but I have studied Nadine Fresco's famous article "The Denial of the Dead," adapted in <CITE>Dissent</CITE> from <CITE>Les Temps modernes;</CITE> Pierre Vidal-Naquet's "A Paper Eichmann?" reprinted in <CITE>Democracy;</CITE> and Arno J. Mayer's "Explorations" column on the same theme in the same magazine. There is also Paul Berman's article in <CITE>The Village Voice</CITE> of June 10, 1981, "Gas Chamber Games: Crackpot History and the Right to Lie," which is a sort of <I>macedoine</I> of the first three.

<P>Let us not waste any time on Robert Faurisson. He is an insanitary figure who maintains contact with neo-Nazi circles and whose project is the rehabilitation, in pseudoscholarly form, of the Third Reich. How he came to be appointed in the first place I cannot imagine (from what I have seen his literary criticism is pitiful), but in 1979 he was a teacher in good standing of French literature at the University of Lyons. If, like our own Arthur Butz, who publishes "historical revisionist" garbage from Northwestern University, he had been left to stew in his own sty, we might have heard no more of him. But in that year he published an article entitled " `The Problem of the Gas Chambers' or the Rumor of Auschwitz.' " The whole appeared in Maurice Bardeche's sheet, <CITE>Defense de l'Occident,</CITE> and extracts were reprinted in <CITE>Le Monde.</CITE> Faurisson summarized his conclusions in a supplement:

</BLOCKQUOTE>
(1) Hitler's "gas chambers" never existed. (2) The "genocide" (or the "attempted genocide") of the Jews never took place; clearly, Hitler never ordered (nor permitted) that someone be killed for racial or religious reasons. (3) The alleged gas chambers and the alleged "genocide' are one and the same lie.  (4) This lie, essentially of Zionist origin, permitted a gigantic politico-financial swindle whose principal beneficiary is the State of Israel. (5) The principal victims of this lie and swindle are the Germans and the Palestinians.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The rest of the "supplement" concerned the sinister ways in which the media had prevented these truths from becoming generally known.

<P>I have no idea whether Faurisson hoped to attract unpleasant attention by the publication of this stuff, but the consequences were fairly immediate. His sternist critic, Nadine Fresco, records: "At Lyons, there were displays of antipathy and Faurisson was lightly molested by Jewish students. Consequently, the president of the university chose to suspend his classes." Fresco slightly minimizes (if that is the word I want) the fact that a subsequent suit, brought against Faurisson for "falsification of history" and for allowing others to use his work for their own fell purposes, was successful and he was condemned by a French court.

<P>In the early stages of this process, Chomsky received a request, from his friend Serge Thion, that he add his name to a petition upholding Faurisson's right to free expression. This, on standard First Amendment grounds and in company with many others, he did. The resulting uproar, in which he was accused of defending Faurisson's <I>theses,</I> led to another request from Thion. Would Chomsky write a statement asserting the right to free speech even in the case of the most loathsome extremist? To this he also assented, pointing out that it was precisely such cases that tested the adherence of a society to such principles and adding in a covering letter that Thion could make what use of it he wished. At this stage, only the conservative Alfred Grosser among French intellectuals had been prepared to say that Faurisson's suspension by the University of Lyons set a bad example of academic courage and independence. Chomsky's pedantic recitation of Voltairean principles would probably have aroused no comment at all had Thion not taker rather promiscuous advantage of the permission to use it as he wished. Without notification to Chomsky, he added the little essay as an <I>avis</I> to Faurisson's pretrial <CITE>Memiore en defense.</CITE>

<P>Chomsky's seven-page comment received more attention in the international press, as Paul Berman noted, than any other piece of work for which he had been responsible. Let me summarize those reactions, which are still worth quoting and which are still (when occasion demands) being repeated:

</BLOCKQUOTE>
Poor Chomsky, innocent victim of a quasi-Pavlovian automatism. Someone mentions "rights," he signs. Someone says "freedom of speech," he signs. He goes even further with the famous preface (which is not really a preface, though it strangely resembles one) to Faurisson's <CITE>Memoire en defense.</CITE> The press seized on the event, and I leave to others the delicate pleasure of pinpointing the ambiguities and contradictions that run through Chomsky's comments about the preface. But it is important to emphasize that the Faurisson affair is not an issue of legal rights. (Nadine Fresco, <CITE>Dissent,</CITE> Fall 1981)

<P>Chomsky -- who, breaking with his usual pattern, praised the traditions of American support for civil liberties. . . . (Ibid.)

<P>Regrettably, Faurisson's new book has an unconscionable preface by Noam Chomsky that is being used to legitimate Faurisson at a bona-fide scholar of the Holocaust. As an unqualified civil libertarian Chomsky claims -- disingenuously -- that he has not read the book he is prefacing! (Arno J. Mayer, <CITE>Democracy,</CITE> April 1981)

<P>Certain people have rallied to Faurisson's defense for reasons of principle. A petition that includes several hundred signatures, among the first those of Noam Chomsky and Alfred Lilienthal, protests against the treatment that Faurisson has received. It implicitly describes his activities as authentic historical research: "Since 1974, he has been conducting extensive independent research into the Holocaust question," and continues by confirming what is not true, namely, that "frightened officials have tried to stop him from further research by denying him access to public libraries and archives."  What is scandalous about this petition is that it doesn't for one moment ask whether what Faurisson says is true or false; and it even describes his findings as though they were the result of serious historical research. Of course, it can be contended that everybody has the right to lie and "bear false witness," a right that is inseparable from the liberty of the individual and recognized, in the liberal tradition, as due the accused for his defense. But the right that a "false witness" may claim should not be granted him in the name of truth. (Pierre Vidal-Naquet, <CITE>Democracy,</CITE> April 1981)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Of these criticisms, the most nearly fair seems to me the one offered by Vidal-Naquet (an early hero of mine because of his book on torture in Algeria). But he is wrong on one factual point. Fresco herself confirmed, and justified, the refusal of certain archivists and documentation centers to permit access to Faurisson. And he is at risk in his distinction between truth and false witness, a distinction which Milton understood better in <CITE>Aeropagitica</CITE> when he argued that the two must be allowed to confront one another if truth is to prevail. There is therefore no obligation, in defending or asserting the right to speak, to pass any comment on the truth or merit of what may be, or is being, said. This is elementary.

<P>Also rather unsafe is the injunction (employed above most crudely by Vidal-Naquet's colleague Arno Mayer) to be careful of the use that may be made of one's remarks or signatures. Elsewhere in the same essay, for example, Vidal-Naquet asserts, "In the case of the genocide of Jews, it is perfectly evident that one of the Jewish ideologies, Zionism, exploits this terrible massacre in a way that is at times quite "scandalous." <I>Scandalous</I> -- the same word that he attaches to Chomsky's signature on a petition. But he supplies the corrective himself -- "that an ideology seizes upon a fact does not make this fact inexistent." Precisely. And the "fact" here is that Chomsky defended not Faurisson's work but his right to research and publish it. Vidal-Naquet undoubtedly knows better than to resort to the old Stalinist "aid and comfort" ruse. Where, then, is the core of his objection?

<P>Does this not leave Arno Mayer, also, in some difficulty? The fact that neo-Nazis may have seized upon Noam Chomsky's civil-libertarian defense does not, of itself, make that defense invalid. Or, if it does, then by himself seizing upon what they have seized upon, Mayer is "objectively" associating civil-libertarian principles with the Nazis -- an unintended compliment that the latter scarcely deserve. Vidal-Naquet's point about Zionism's exploitation of the Holocaust could, if cleverly enough ripped from its context, be used to support point (4) in Faurisson's "supplement" above. Who but a malicious falsifier would make such a confusion as to who was in whose <I>galere?</I>

<P>I wouldn't accuse any of the critics listed here of deliberate falsification. But it is nevertheless untrue to describe Chomsky's purloined <I>avis</I> as a preface, as Fresco does on almost a dozen occasions and as Mayer does twice. It is also snide, at best, to accuse Chomsky of "breaking with his usual pattern" in praising "the traditions of American support for civil liberty."  He has, as a matter of record, upheld these traditions more staunchly than most -- speaking up for the right of extremist academics like [Walter] Rostow, for example, at a time during the Vietnam War when some campuses were too turbulent to accommodate them. It is irrelevant, at least, to do as Fresco also does and mention Voltaire's anti-Semitism. (As absurd a suggestion, in the circumstances, as the vulgar connection between Locke and imperialism.) Would she never quote Voltaire? Finally, she says that no question of legal rights arises because the suit against Faurisson was "private." What difference does that make? An authoritarian law, giving the state the right to pronounce on truth, is an authoritarian law whoever invokes it.

<P>Chomsky can be faulted here on three grounds only. First, for giving a power of attorney to Serge Thion, who seems rather a protean and quicksilvery fellow. Second, for once unguardedly describing Faurisson as "a sort of relatively apolitical liberal." Admittedly, this came in the context of an assertion that Faurisson's opinions were a closed book to him; still, all the more reason not to speculate. The whole point is that Faurisson's opinions are <I>not</I> the point. Third, for attempting at the last minute, when he discovered too late that he was being bound into the same volume as a work he had not read, to have his commentary excised. He writes of this that "in the climate of hysteria among Paris intellectuals it would be impossible to distinguish defense of the man's right to express his views from endorsement of these views." Maybe. But Voltairean precepts involve precisely the running of that risk.

<P>This is still nothing to do with "endorsement" and explains the repeated feverish sarcasm with which his critics claim that he had not "even read the endorsed" volume. Again, the irony would seem to be at their expense. An unread book is an unendorsed one, unless one assumes that Chomsky would endorse any Holocaust revisionist on principle -- an allegation so fantastic that it has not "even" been made. If, by any action or statement, Chomsky had hinted at sympathy for Faurisson's views, I think that we would know about it by now. The recurring attempt, therefore, to bracket him with the century's most heinous movement must be adjudged a smear. And the wider attempt -- to classify all critics of Israel as infected or compromised with anti-Semitism -- is, of course, itself a trivialization of the Holocaust.


<A NAME="triangle"><P><H3>The Case of the Forgotten War</H3></A>

<P>Chomsky's evolving position on the Middle East conflict is the source of much of his unpopularity and (one sometimes suspects) the cause of much of the spite with which he is attacked on other issues. But where are the baying hounds this time? I can offer no lists of critics, no litany of denunciations. Chomsky wrote a book of more than 450 pages that was devoted to the United States and the Lebanese war of 1982, and what do you think? There was barely a squeak.

<P>An unreviewed book is no rare thing in the United States, There is usually some explanation for the nonevent. The author may be obscure, or the subject arcane, or the issue dead, or the "issue" too widely covered already. Again, there may be no qualified reviewer in sight, so that, rather than assign the volume to an amateur, the books department may blushfully "pass" on the whole idea. A version of the same procedure is sometimes followed when no reviewer with a big enough "name" is on hand. And there are postal delays, crowded schedules, demands on inelastic space.  Everyone remotely connected with "the trade" understands this, even when the rough and the smooth seem to be insufficiently random in their distribution. A good advertising budget has been known to help, but nobody is so coarse as to insinuate that it determines anything much.

<P>These well-known vagaries and mutabilities cannot explain why, in the fall of 1983, Chomsky's book <CITE>The Fateful Triangle</CITE> was treated as if it did not exist. Consider: One of America's best-known Jewish scholars, internationally respected, writes a lengthy, dense, highly documented book about United States policy in the Levant. The book is acidly critical of Israeli policy and of the apparently limitless American self-deception as to its true character. It quotes sources in Hebrew and French as well as in English. It is published at a time when hundreds of United States marines have been killed in Beirut and when the President is wavering in his commitment, which itself threatens to become a major election issue. It is the only book of its scope (we need make no judgment as to depth) to appear in the continental United States. The screens and the headlines are full of approximations and guesses on the subject. Yet, at this unusually fortunate juncture for publication, the following newspapers review it: (1) the <CITE>Los Angeles Herald-Examiner;</CITE> (2) <CITE>The Boston Globe.</CITE> In Los Angeles, Chomsky has an admirer who is also a local book reviewer. This man prevails after a struggle. In Boston, Chomsky is a well-known local figure. But that's it. Many months later, after its foal, the <CITE>London Review of Books,</CITE> has devoted many respectful columns to the book, and after almost every major newspaper and magazine in England, Canada, and Australia has done the same, <CITE>The New York Review of Books</CITE> publishes a "mixed review." This presumably takes care of the only other possible editorial excuse (itself significant) -- that <CITE>The Fateful Triangle</CITE> was published by a small radical house in Cambridge, Massachusetts, named South End Press.

<P>Paranoia would be inappropriate here. After all, this was not 1973, when the first edition of Chomsky and Herman's <CITE>The Political Economy of Human Rights</CITE> was suppressed by its own publishers, Warner Communications, for making unpatriotic assertions about United States policy in Indochina and elsewhere. The twenty thousand copies might have been pulped if it were not for a legally binding contract. Instead they were sold to an obscure outfit named MSS Information Corporation, where upon Warner -- which later bid high for the Nixon memoirs -- washed its hands of the entire deal and of all responsibility for advertising, promotion, and distribution. Difficult to imagine that happening to anyone else of remotely comparable stature, but, as I say, 1983 was different. The book was out, and the foreign-policy intelligentsia had every chance to comment.

<P>I confess that I have no ready explanation for the total eclipse that followed. <CITE>The New York Times</CITE> had found Chomsky interesting enough to publish two long and pitying articles about the Faurisson business. Other newspapers and magazines seem, as I suppose I have shown, to find him deserving of comment. I therefore rang a selection of literary editors and asked if they could explain their reticence on this occasion.

<P>I began with <CITE>The New Republic,</CITE> because it is mentioned so often in <CITE>The Fateful Triangle</CITE> and because its editors had assured me at the time that they would not let the critique go unanswered. Leon Wieseltier, the literary editor, told me jauntily when I inquired:

</BLOCKQUOTE>
The book was sent to reviewers. The first was too disgusted to review it. The second said that he would, and finally didn't, which frequently happens. I see no reason not to assign Chomsky's books for review, because I see no reason for him to be above criticism.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Editors at <CITE>The New York Times Book Review</CITE> and <CITE>The Washington Post Book World</CITE> were less ready to be quoted but quite ready to talk. From the <CITE>Times</CITE> I heard variously, "I think we tuned out on Noam after Vietnam," "It fell through the cracks," and "We never received the book." From the <CITE>Post,</CITE> I heard that "by the time we got all those letters protesting about not reviewing it, the book wasn't in local bookstores -- so we didn't." I also heard that there was some doubt about having received the copy in the first place.

<P>Katha Pollitt, who was literary editor of <CITE>The Nation</CITE> at this time, told me that there were already too many books about the Middle East, that the "front half" of the magazine devoted plenty of space to the subject, and that she herself preferred to preserve her pages for articles on fiction, poetry, and feminism.

<P>Joe Clark, then books editor at <CITE>Dissent,</CITE> told me, "My guess is that I didn't feel a very strong desire to review the book." He said he would "have needed an overpowering reason." Clearly, the frequent and scornful mention of <CITE>Dissent</CITE> in <CITE>The Fateful Triangle</CITE> did not supply this incentive. For the literary editor of <CITE>The New Republic</CITE> to say that he sees "no reason for [Chomsky] to be above criticism" is presumably a joke. For him to say that the first invited contributor was "too disgusted" to review the book is not. The first invited reviewer, as I know and as Wieseltier confirmed to me, was Ze'ev Schiff, military correspondent of <CITE>Ha'aretz</CITE> and coauthor of <CITE>Israel's Lebanon War.</CITE> "Disgust" is certainly not what he evinced when I spoke to him about the book in the summer of 1984.

<P>A category mistake is involved in the <CITE>Post</CITE> explanation, unless the editors of that newspaper assume there to be no connection between their failure to review a book and its absence from Washington's bookstores. I like the idea, though, of their not giving in to letters from readers.

<P>The <CITE>Times</CITE> may perhaps not have received a copy, though South End Press was doing nothing but lobby for its chief title between November and June, and claims to have sent four in all. Radical incompetence allowed for, what is there to prevent an editor from doing what editors do every day and requesting a copy?

<P>Pollitt has a point, and even though the rules of fairness oblige me to be harder on a former colleague, I can't see a way through her candor.

<P>So what it comes down to is this. Life is unfair, and though it does seem odd that such a book is ignored only in its country of origin (and the country whose state policy it attacks), the whole thing is easily explicable. Above all, it is <I>nobody's fault.</I> Does this mean that there is no reluctance to hear the bad news about the Middle East? Well, again, and whether or not you believe in cock-up rather than conspiracy -- a favorite evasion of the soothing commentator -- it does seem harder for some people to get an audience than others. Especially hard for the man who, according to Shawcross, enjoyed sufficient sway to confuse or silence the American press over the question of Cambodia.

<P>Whether he is ignored, whether he is libeled, or whether he is subjected to an active campaign of abuse, Chomsky is attacked for things that he is thought to believe, or believed to have said. A lie, it has been written, can travel around the world before truth has even got its shoes on. Merely to list the accusations against Chomsky, whether they are made casually or with deliberation, is a relatively easy task. Showing their unfairness or want of foundation involves expense of ink on a scale which any reader who has got this far will know to his or her cost. Perhaps for this reason, not all the editors who publish matter about Chomsky ever quite get around to publishing his replies. I could write an ancillary article showing this in detail, with his answers either unpublished or unscrupulously abridged. And, of course, a man who writes a lot of letters to the editor soon gets a reputation, like Bellow's Herzog, as a crank, an eccentric, a fanatic. Whereas the absence of a reply is taken as admission of guilt. . .

<P>Ought I to be "evenhanded" and indicate where I disagree with Chomsky myself? I don't really see why I ought. My differences with him concern things that he does believe and has said. I also dissent from him, quite often, concerning the way in which he says things and on his repeated misuse of the verb "to brutalize." I think he has sometimes been facile about Cold War "moral equivalence" as well. But this is between him and me, or him and any other political opponent or critic who observes the rules of evidence and debate.

<P>For the recurrent way in which this is <I>not</I> done, and for the process whereby the complaisant mainstream and the conservative guardians actually <I>agree not to hear</I> what is being said about them and their system, we need a word. "Marginalization" is too merely descriptive. "Ghettoization" is too self-pitying. It may come to me.

<P>The contemporary United States expresses the greatest of all paradoxes. It is at one and the same time a democracy -- at any rate a pluralist open society -- and an empire. No other country has ever been, or had, both things at once. Or not for long. And there must be some question about the durability of this present coexistence, too. Already spokesmen of the Reagan Administration say plainly that their foreign and military policy is incompatible with the disloyalty and division that stem from a deliberative Congress and an inquisitive press. They laughably exaggerate the reflective capacity of the first and the adversary character of the second, but they have a point. If it is to have the least chance of success, their strategy calls for an imposed national unanimity, a well-cultivated awareness of "enemies within," and a strong draft of amnesia.

<P>The academy and the wealthy new batch of think tanks are awash with people who collude, at least passively, in the process. As C. Wright Mills once wrote:

</BLOCKQUOTE>
Their academic reputations rest, quite largely, upon their academic power: they are the members of the committee; they are on the directing board; they can get you the job, the trip, the research grant. They are a strange new kind of bureaucrat. They are executives of the mind. . . . They could set up a research project or even a school, but I would be surprised, if, now after twenty years of research and teaching and observing and thinking, they could produce a book which told you what they thought was going on in the world, what they thought were the major problems for men of this historical epoch.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Not even Mills, or Chomsky in his "New Mandarins" essay, could have anticipated the world of the Heritage Foundation, of "Kissinger Associates," of numberless power-worshipping, power-seeking magazines and institutes interlocking across the dissemination of culture, priority, information, and opinion. But Mills did write, in 1942:

</BLOCKQUOTE>
When events move very fast and possible worlds swing around them, something happens to the quality of thinking. Some men repeat formulae; some men become reporters. To time observation with thought so as to mate a decent level of abstraction with crucial happenings is a difficult problem.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Noam Chomsky has attempted, as a volunteer, necessarily imperfectly, to shoulder this responsibility at a time of widespread betrayal of it. And it must be an awed attitude to the new style -- a willingness to demonstrate flexibility in the face of so much pelf and so much cant -- that allows so many people to join in ridiculing him for doing so. As a philosophical anarchist, Chomsky might dislike to have it said that he had "done the state some service," but he a useful citizen in ways that his detractors are emphatically not.

<H1>His Right to Say It</H1>

<P>Noam Chomsky<BR>
<CITE>The Nation,</CITE> February 28, 1981
</CENTER>


<P>
An article in the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> concerning my involvement
in the &quot;Faurisson affair&quot; was headlined &quot;French
Storm in a Demitasse.&quot; If the intent was to imply that these
events do not even merit being called &quot;a tempest in a teapot,&quot;
I am inclined to agree. Nevertheless, torrents of ink have been
spilled in Europe, and some here. Perhaps, given the obfuscatory
nature of the coverage, it would be useful for me to state the
basic facts as I understand them and to say a few words about
the principles that arise.
<P>
In the fall of 1979, I was asked by Serge Thion, a libertarian
socialist scholar with a record of opposition to all forms of
totalitarianism, to sign a petition calling on authorities to
insure Robert Faurisson's &quot;safety and the free exercise of
his legal rights.&quot; The petition said nothing about his &quot;holocaust
studies&quot; (he denies the existence of gas chambers or of a
systematic plan to massacre the Jews and questions the authenticity
of the Anne Frank diary, among other things), apart from noting
that they were the cause of &quot;efforts to deprive Professor
Faurisson of his freedom of speech and expression.&quot; It did
not specify the steps taken against him, which include suspension
from his teaching position at the University of Lyons after the
threat of violence, and a forthcoming court trial for falsification
of history and damages to victims of Nazism.
<P>
The petition aroused considerable protest. In <CITE>Nouvel Observateur,</CITE>
Claude Roy wrote that &quot;the appeal launched by Chomsky&quot;
supported Faurisson's views. Roy explained my alleged stand as
an attempt to show that the United States is indistinguishable
from Nazi Germany. In <CITE>Esprit,</CITE> Pierre Vidal-Naquet found
the petition &quot;scandalous&quot; on the ground that it &quot;presented
his 'conclusions' as if they were actually discoveries.&quot;
Vidal-Naquet misunderstood a sentence in the petition that ran,
&quot;Since he began making his findings public, Professor Faurisson
has been subject to....&quot; The term &quot;findings&quot;
is quite neutral. One can say, without contradiction: &quot;He
made his findings public and they were judged worthless, irrelevant,
falsified....&quot; The petition implied nothing about quality
of Faurisson's work, which was irrelevant to the issues raised.
<P>
Thion then asked me to write a brief statement on the purely civil
libertarian aspects of this affair. I did so, telling him to use
it as he wished. In this statement, I made it explicit that I
would not discuss Faurisson's work, having only limited familiarity
with it (and, frankly, little interest in it). Rather, I restricted
myself to the civil-liberties issues and the implications of the
fact that it was even necessary to recall Voltaire's famous words
in a letter to M. le Riche: &quot;I detest what you write, but
I would give my life to make it possible for you to continue to
write.&quot;
<P>
Faurisson's conclusions are diametrically opposed to views I hold
and have frequently expressed in print (for example, in my book
<CITE>Peace in the Middle East?,</CITE> where I describe the holocaust
as &quot;the most fantastic outburst of collective insanity in
human history&quot;). But it is elementary that freedom of expression
(including academic freedom) is not to be restricted to views
of which one approves, and that it is precisely in the case of
views that are almost universally despised and condemned that
this right must be most vigorously defended. It is easy enough
to defend those who need no defense or to join in unanimous (and
often justified) condemnation of a violation of civil rights by
some official enemy.
<P>
I later learned that my statement was to appear in a book in which
Faurisson defends himself against the charges soon to be brought
against him in court. While this was not my intention, it was
not contrary to my instructions. I received a letter from Jean-Pierre
Faye, a well-known anti-Fascist writer and militant, who agreed
with my position but urged me to withhold my statement because
the climate of opinion in France was such that my defense of Faurisson's
right to express his views would be interpreted as support for
them. I wrote to him that I accepted his judgment, and requested
that my statement not appear, but by then it was too late to stop
publication.
<P>
Parts of my letter to Faye appeared in the French press and have
been widely quoted and misquoted and subjected to fantastic interpretations.
It was reported, for example, that I repudiated my comments after
having learned that there is anti-Semitism in France, and that
I was changing my views on the basis of clippings from the French
press (in the same letter, I had asked Faye to send me clippings
on another matter). My personal letter to Faye was incomprehensible
to anyone who had not read Faye's original letter to me; a telephone
call would quickly have clarified the facts.
<P>
The uproar that ensued is of some interest. In <CITE>Le Matin</CITE>
(socialist), Jacques Baynac wrote that my fundamental error was
to &quot;defend, in the name of freedom of expression, the right
to mock the facts&quot; -- &quot;facts&quot; determined, presumably,
by some board of commissars or a reconstituted Inquisition. My
lengthy discussion on the implications of this doctrine was from
the occasionally recognizable version of the interview with me
published in <CITE>Le Matin</CITE>. In <CITE>Le Monde,</CITE> the editor
of <CITE>Esprit,</CITE> Paul Thibaud, wrote that I had condemned &quot;the
entire French intelligentsia,&quot; launching a &quot;general
accusation&quot; against &quot;les Francais&quot; without qualifications.
Alberto Cavallari, Paris correspondent for the <CITE>Corriere della
Sera</CITE> went further still, claiming that I had condemned all
of &quot;French culture.&quot; The article is notable for a series
of fabricated quotes designed to establish this and other allegations.
What I had written was that though I would make some harsh comments
about &quot;certain segments of the French intelligentsia... certainly, what I say does not apply to many others, who maintain
a firm commitment to intellectual integrity...I would not
want these comments to be misunderstood as applying beyond their
specific scope.&quot; Similar qualifications are removed from
the doctored &quot;interview&quot; in <CITE>Le Matin,</CITE> enabling
the editors to allege that I describe France as &quot;totalitarian.&quot;
<P>
Cavallari went on to explain that my rage against &quot;French
culture&quot; derives from its refusal to accept the theory that
linguistics proves that &quot;the Gulag descends directly from
Rousseau&quot; and other imbecile ideas he chooses to attribute
to me for reasons best known to himself. In <CITE>Nouvel Observateur,</CITE>
Jean-Paul Enthoven offers a different explanation: I support Faurisson
because my &quot;instrumentalist theory of language, the 'generative
grammar'...does not allow the means to think of the unimaginable,
that is the holocaust.&quot; He and Cavallari, among others, explain
further that my defense of Faurisson is a case of the extreme
left joining the extreme right, a phenomenon to which they devote
many sage words. In <CITE>Le Matin,</CITE> Catherine Clement explains
my odd behavior on the ground that I am a &quot;perfect Bostonian,&quot;
&quot;a cold and distant man, without real social contacts, incapable
of understanding Jewish-American humor, which relies heavily on
Yiddish.&quot; Pierre Daix explains in <CITE>Le Quotidien de Paris</CITE>
that I took up left-wing causes to &quot;clear myself&quot; of
the reactionary implications of my &quot;innatism.&quot; And so
on, at about the same level.
<P>
To illustrate the caliber of discussion, after I had noted that
Vidal-Naquet's comment cited above was based on a misunderstanding,
he reprinted his article in a book (<CITE>Les Juifs,</CITE> F. Maspero),
eliminating the passage I quoted and adding an appendix in which
he claims falsely that &quot;the error in question had appeared
only in an earlier draft,&quot; which I am accused of having illegitimately
quoted. The example is, unfortunately, quite typical.
<P>
A number of critics (for example Abraham Forman of the Anti-Defamation
League in <CITE>Le Matin</CITE>) contend that the only issue is Faurisson's
right to publish and that this has not been denied. The issue,
however, is his suspension from the university because of threats
of violence against him, and his court trial. It is of interest
that his attorney, Yvon Chotard, who is defending him on grounds
of freedom of expression and the right to an attorney of one's
choice, has been threatened with expulsion from the anti-Fascist
organization that is bringing Faurisson to trial.
<P>
As Faye predicted, many showed themselves incapable of distinguishing
between defense of the right of free expression and defense of
the views expressed -- and not only in France. In <CITE>The New Republic,</CITE>
Martin Peretz concluded from my expressed lack of interest in
Faurisson's work that I am an &quot;agnostic&quot; about the holocaust
and &quot;a fool&quot; about genocide. He claims further that
I deny freedom of expression to my opponents, referring to my
comment that one degrades oneself by entering into debate over
certain issues. In short, if I refuse to debate you, I constrain
your freedom. He is careful to conceal the example I cited: the
holocaust.
<P>
Many writers find it scandalous that I should support the right
of free expression for Faurisson without carefully analyzing his
work, a strange doctrine which, if adopted, would effectively
block defense of civil rights for unpopular views. Faurisson does
not control the French press or scholarship. There is surely no
lack of means or opportunity to refute or condemn his writings.
My own views in sharp opposition to his are clearly on record,
as I have said. No rational person will condemn a book, however
outlandish its conclusions may seem, without at least reading
it carefully; in this case, checking the documentation offered,
and so on. One of the most bizarre criticisms has been that by
refusing to undertake this task, I reveal that I have no interest
in six million murdered Jews, a criticism which, if valid, applies
to everyone who shares my lack of interest in examining Faurisson's
work. One who defends the right of free expression incurs no special
responsibility to study or even be acquainted with the views expressed.
I have, for example, frequently gone well beyond signing petitions
in support of East European dissidents subjected to repression
or threats, often knowing little and caring less about their views
(which in some cases I find obnoxious, a matter of complete irrelevance
that I never mention in this connection). I recall no criticism
of this stand.
<P>
The latter point merits further comment. I have taken far more
controversial stands than this in support of civil liberties and
academic freedom. At the height of the Vietnam War, I publicly
took the stand that people I regard as authentic war criminals
should not be denied the right to teach on political or ideological
grounds, and I have always taken the same stand with regard to
scientists who &quot;prove&quot; that blacks are genetically inferior,
in a country where their history is hardly pleasant, and where
such views will be used by racists and neo-Nazis. Whatever one
thinks of Faurisson, no one has accused him of being the architect
of major war crimes or claiming that Jews are genetically inferior
(though it is irrelevant to the civil-liberties issue, he writes
of the &quot;heroic insurrection of the Warsaw ghetto&quot; and
praises those who &quot;fought courageously against Nazism&quot;
in &quot;the right cause&quot;). I even wrote in 1969 that it
would be wrong to bar counterinsurgency research in the universities,
though it was being used to murder and destroy, a position that
I am not sure I could defend. What is interesting is that these
far more controversial stands never aroused a peep of protest,
which shows that the refusal to accept the right of free expression
without retaliation, and the horror when others defend this right,
is rather selective.
<P>
The reaction of the PEN Club in Paris is also interesting. PEN
denounces my statements on the ground that they have given publicity
to Faurisson's writing at a time when there is a resurgence of
anti-Semitism. It is odd that an organization devoted to freedom
of expression for authors should be exercised solely because Faurisson's
defense against the charges brought against him is publicly heard.
Furthermore, if publicity is being accorded to Faurisson, it is
because he is being brought to trial (presumably, with the purpose
of airing the issues) and because the press has chosen to create
a scandal about my defense of his civil rights. On many occasions,
I have written actual prefaces and endorsements for books in France
-- books that are unread and unknown, as indeed is the case generally
with my own writings. The latter fact is illustrated, for example,
by Thibaud, who claims that I advocated &quot;confiding Vietnamese
freedom to the supposed good will of the leaders of the North.&quot;
In fact, my writings on the war were overwhelmingly devoted to
the U.S. attack on the peasant society of the South (and later
Laos and Cambodia as well), which aimed to undermine the neutralization
proposals of the National Liberation Front and others and to destroy
the rural society in which the NLF was based, and I precisely
warned that success in this effort &quot;will create a situation
in which, indeed, North Vietnam will necessarily dominate Indochina,
for no other viable society will remain.&quot;
<P>
Thibaud's ignorant falsifications point to one of the real factors
that lie behind this affair. A number of these critics are ex-Stalinists,
or people like Thibaud, who is capable of writing that prior to
Solzhenitsyn, &quot;every previous account&quot; of &quot;Sovietism&quot;
was within the Trotskyite framework (<CITE>Esprit</CITE>). Intellectuals
who have recently awakened to the possibility of an anti-Leninist
critique often systematically misunderstand a discussion of revolutionary
movements and efforts to crush them that has never employed the
assumptions they associate with the left. Thibaud, for example,
cannot understand why I do not share his belief that Lenin, Stalin
and Pol Pot demonstrate &quot;the failure of socialism.&quot;
Many left or ex-left intellectuals seem unaware that I never have
regarded Leninist movements as having anything to do with &quot;socialism&quot;
in any meaningful sense of the term; or that, having grown up
in the libertarian anti-Leninist left, familiar since childhood
with works that Thibaud has still never heard of, I am unimpressed
with their recent conversions and unwilling to join in their new
crusades, which often strike me as morally dubious and intellectually
shallow. All of this has led to a great deal of bitterness on
their part and not a little outright deceit.
<P>
As for the resurgence of anti-Semitism to which the PEN Club refers,
or of racist atrocities, one may ask if the proper response to
publication of material that may be used to enhance racist violence
and oppression is to deny civil rights. Or is it, rather, to seek
the causes of these vicious developments and work to eliminate
them? To a person who upholds the basic ideas professed in the
Western democracies, or who is seriously concerned with the real
evils that confront us, the answer seems clear.
<P>
There are, in fact, far more dangerous manifestations of &quot;revisionism&quot;
than Faurisson's. Consider the effort to show that the United
States engaged in no crimes in Vietnam, that it was guilty only
of &quot;intellectual error.&quot; This &quot;revisionism,&quot;
in contrast to that of Faurisson, is supported by the major institutions
and has always been the position of most of the intelligentsia,
and has very direct and ugly policy consequences. Should we then
argue that people advocating this position be suspended from teaching
and brought to trial? The issue is, of course, academic. If the
version of the Zhdanov doctrine now being put forth in the Faurisson
affair were adopted by people with real power, it would not be
the &quot;Vietnam revisionists&quot; who would be punished.
<P>
I do not want to leave the impression that the whole of the French
press has been a theater of the absurd or committed to such views
as those reviewed. There has been accurate commentary in <CITE>Le
Monde</CITE> and <CITE>Liberation,</CITE> for example, and a few people
have taken a clear and honorable stand. Thus Alfred Grosser, who
is critical of what he believes to be my position, writes in <CITE>Le
Quotidien de Paris</CITE>: &quot;I consider it shocking that Mr.
Faurisson should be prevented from teaching French literature
at the University of Lyons on the pretext that his security cannot
be guaranteed.&quot;
<P>
In the Italian left-liberal journal <CITE>Repubblica,</CITE> Barbara
Spinelli writes that the real scandal in this affair is the fact
that even a few people publicly affirm their support of the right
to express ideas that are almost universally reviled -- and that
happen to be diametrically opposed to their own. My own observation
is different. It seems to me something of a scandal that it is
even necessary to debate these issues two centuries after Voltaire
defended the right of free expression for views he detested. It
is a poor service to the memory of the victims of the holocaust
to adopt a central doctrine of their murderers.

<H1><FONT SIZE=5>Some Elementary Comments on </FONT><BR>
The Rights of Freedom of Expression</H1>

<P>Noam Chomsky<BR>
Appeared as an avis to Faurisson's <CITE>Memoire en defense</CITE>
</CENTER>


<P>
The remarks that follow are sufficiently banal so that I feel
that an apology is in order to reasonable people who may happen
to read them. If there is, nevertheless, good reason to put them
on paper -- and I fear that there is -- this testifies to some remarkable
features of contemporary French intellectual culture.
<P>
Before I turn to the subject on which I have been asked to comment,
two clarifications are necessary. The remarks that follow are
limited in two crucial respects. First: I am concerned here solely
with a narrow and specific topic, namely, the right of free expression
of ideas, conclusions and beliefs. I have nothing to say here
about the work of Robert Faurisson or his critics, of which I
know very little, or about the topics they address, concerning
which I have no special knowledge. Second: I will have some harsh
(but merited) things to say about certain segments of the French
intelligentsia, who have demonstrated that they have not the slightest
concern for fact or reason, as I have learned from unpleasant
personal experience that I will not review here. Certainly, what
I say does not apply to many others, who maintain a firm commitment
to intellectual integrity. This is not the place for a detailed
account. The tendencies to which I refer are, I believe, sufficiently
significant to merit attention and concern, but I would not want
these comments to be misunderstood as applying beyond their specific
scope.
<P>
Some time ago I was asked to sign a petition in defense of Robert
Faurisson's &quot;freedom of speech and expression.&quot; The
petition said absolutely nothing about the character, quality
or validity of his research, but restricted itself quite explicitly
to a defense of elementary rights that are taken for granted in
democratic societies, calling upon university and government officials
to &quot;do everything possible to ensure the [Faurisson's] safety
and the free exercise of his legal rights.&quot; I signed it without
hesitation.
<P>
The fact that I had signed the petition aroused a storm of protest
in France. In the <CITE>Nouvel Observateur</CITE>, an ex-Stalinist
who has changed allegiance but not intellectual style published
a grossly falsified version of the contents of the petition, amidst
a stream of falsehoods that merit no comment. This, however, I
have come to regard as normal. I was considerably more surprised
to read in <CITE>Esprit</CITE> (September 1980) that Pierre Vidal-Naquet
found the petition &quot;scandaleuse,&quot; citing specifically
that fact that I had signed it (I omit the discussion of an accompanying
article by the editor that again merits no comment, at least among
people who retain a commitment to elementary values of truth and
honesty).
<P>
Vidal-Naquet offers exactly one reason for finding the petition,
and my act of signing it, &quot;scandaleuse&quot;: the petition,
he claims, presented Faurisson's &quot; 'conclusions' comme si
elles etaient effectivement des decouvertes [as if they had just
been discovered].&quot; Vidal-Naquet's statement is false. The
petition simply stated that Faurisson had presented his &quot;finding,&quot;
which is uncontroversial, stating or implying precisely nothing
about their value and implying nothing about their validity. Perhaps
Vidal-Naquet was misled by faulty understanding of the English
wording of the petition; that is, perhaps he misunderstood the
English word &quot;findings.&quot; It is, of course, obvious that
if I say that someone presented his &quot;findings&quot; I imply
nothing whatsoever about their character or validity; the statement
is perfectly neutral in this respect. I assume that it was indeed
a simple misunderstanding of the text that led Vidal-Naquet to
write what he did, in which case he will, of course, publicly
withdraw that accusation that I (among others) have done something
&quot;scandaleuse&quot; in signing an innocuous civil rights petition
of the sort that all of us sign frequently.
<P>
I do not want to discuss individuals. Suppose, then, that some
person does indeed find the petition &quot;scandaleuse,&quot;
not on the basis of misreading, but because of what it actually
says. Let us suppose that this person finds Faurisson's ideas
offensive, even horrendous, and finds his scholarship to be a
scandal. Let us suppose further that he is correct in these conclusions
-- whether he is or not is plainly irrelevant in this context.
Then we must conclude that the person in question believes that
the petition was &quot;scandaleuse&quot; because Faurisson should
indeed be denied the normal rights of self-expression, should
be barred from the university, should be subjected to harassment
and even violence, etc. Such attitudes are not uncommon. They
are typical, for example of American Communists and no doubt their
counterparts elsewhere. Among people who have learned something
from the 18th century (say, Voltaire) it is a truism, hardly deserving
discussion, that the defense of the right of free expression is
not restricted to ideas one approves of, and that it is precisely
in the case of ideas found most offensive that these rights must
be most vigorously defended. Advocacy of the right to express
ideas that are generally approved is, quite obviously, a matter
of no significance. All of this is well-understood in the United
States, which is why there has been nothing like the Faurisson
affair here. In France, where a civil libertarian tradition is
evidently not well-established and where there have been deep
totalitarian strains among the intelligentsia for many years (collaborationism,
the great influence of Leninism and its offshoots, the near-lunatic
character of the new intellectual right, etc.), matters are apparently
quite different.
<P>
For those who are concerned with the state of French intellectual
culture, the Faurisson affair is not without interest. Two comparisons
immediately come to mind. The first is this. I have frequently
signed petitions -- indeed, gone to far greater lengths -- on behalf
of Russian dissidents whose views are absolutely horrendous: advocates
of ongoing U.S. savagery in Indochina, or of policies that would
lead to nuclear war, or of a religious chauvinism that is reminiscent
of the dark ages. No one has ever raised an objection. Should
someone have done so, I would regard this with the same contempt
as is deserved by the behavior of those who denounce the petition
in support of Faurisson's civil rights, and for exactly the same
reason. I do not read the Communist Party press, but I have little
doubt that the commissars and apparatchiks have carefully perused
these petitions, seeking out phrases that could be maliciously
misinterpreted, in an effort to discredit these efforts to prevent
the suppression of human rights. In comparison, when I state that
irrespective of his views, Faurisson's civil rights should be
guaranteed, this is taken to be &quot;scandaleuse&quot; and a
great fuss is made about it in France. The reason for the distinction
seems obvious enough. In the case of the Russian dissidents, the
state (our states) approves of supporting them, for its own reasons,
which have little to do with concern for human rights, needless
to say. In the case of Faurisson, however, defense of his civil
rights is not officially approved doctrine -- far from it -- so
that segments of the intelligentsia, who are ever eager to line
up and march off to the beat of the drums, do not perceive any
need to take the stance accepted without question in the case
of Soviet dissidents. In France, there may well be other factors:
perhaps a lingering guilt about disgraceful behavior of substantial
sectors under Vichy, the failure to protest the French wars in
Indochina, that lasting impact of Stalinism and more generally
Leninist doctrines, the bizarre and dadaistic character of certain
streams of intellectual life in postwar France which makes rational
discourse appear to be such an odd and unintelligible pastime,
the currents of anti-Semitism that have exploded into violence.
<P>
A second comparison also comes to mind. I rarely have much good
to say about the mainstream intelligentsia in the United States,
who generally resemble their counterparts elsewhere. Still, it
is very illuminating to compare the reaction to the Faurisson
affair in France and to the same phenomenon here. In the United
States, Arthur Butz (whom one might regard as the American Faurisson)
has not been subjected to the kind of merciless attack levelled
against Faurisson. When the &quot;no holocaust&quot; historians
hold a large international meeting in the United States, as they
did some months ago, there is nothing like the hysteria that we
find in France over the Faurisson affair. When the American Nazi
Party calls for a parade in the largely Jewish city of Skokie,
Illinois -- obviously, pure provocation -- the American Civil Liberties
Union defends their rights (though of course, the American Communist
Party is infuriated). As far as I am aware, much the same is true
in England or Australia, countries which, like the United States,
have a live civil libertarian tradition. Butz and the rest are
sharply criticized and condemned, but without any attack on their
civil rights, to my knowledge. There is no need, in these countries,
for an innocuous petition such as the one that is found &quot;scandaleuse&quot;
in France, and if there were such a petition, it would surely
not be attacked outside of limited and insignificant circles.
The comparison is, again, illuminating. One should try to understand
it. One might argue, perhaps, that Nazism and anti-Semitism are
much more threatening in France. I think that this is true, but
it is simply a reflection of the same factors that led to the
Leninism of substantial sectors of the French intelligentsia for
a long period, their contempt for elementary civil libertarian
principles today, and their current fanaticism in beating the
drums for crusades against the Third World. There are, in short,
deep-seated totalitarian strains that emerge in various guises,
a matter well worth further consideration, I believe.
<P>
Let me add a final remark about Faurisson's alleged &quot;anti-Semitism.&quot;
Note first that even if Faurisson were to be a rabid anti-Semite
and fanatic pro-Nazi -- such charges have been presented to me
in private correspondence that it would be improper to cite in
detail here -- this would have no bearing whatsoever on the legitimacy
of the defense of his civil rights. On the contrary, it would
make it all the more imperative to defend them since, once again,
it has been a truism for years, indeed centuries, that it is precisely
in the case of horrendous ideas that the right of free expression
must be most vigorously defended; it is easy enough to defend
free expression for those who require no such defense. Putting
this central issue aside, is it true that Faurisson is an anti-Semite
or a neo-Nazi? As noted earlier, I do not know his work very well.
But from what I have read -- largely as a result of the nature
of the attacks on him -- I find no evidence to support either conclusion.
Nor do I find credible evidence in the material that I have read
concerning him, either in the public record or in private correspondence.
As far as I can determine, he is a relatively apolitical liberal
of some sort. In support of the charge of anti-Semitism, I have
been informed that Faurisson is remembered by some schoolmates
as having expressed anti-Semitic sentiments in the 1940s, and
as having written a letter that some interpret as having anti-Semitic
implications at the time of the Algerian war. I am a little surprised
that serious people should put such charges forth -- even in private -- as a sufficient basis for castigating someone as a long-time
and well-known anti-Semitic. I am aware of nothing in the public
record to support such charges. I will not pursue the exercise,
but suppose we were to apply similar standards to others, asking,
for example, what their attitude was towards the French war in
Indochina, or to Stalinism, decades ago. Perhaps no more need
be said.

<P>On May 1, 1977, the<CITE> New York Times </CITE>published an account of the "painful problems of peace" in Vietnam by Fox Butterfield. He describes the "woes" of the people of the South, their "sense of hardship" and the grim conditions of their life, concluding that "most Southerners are said to appear resigned to their fate." His evidence comes from "diplomats, refugees and letters from Vietnam." In journals of the War Resisters League and the American Friends Service Committee of March-May 1977, in contrast, there are lengthy reports by Carol Bragg on a visit to Vietnam earlier this year by a six-person AFSC delegation, including two who had worked in Vietnam and are fluent in Vietnamese. The group traveled widely in the South and spoke to well-known leaders of the non-Communist Third Force who are active in the press and government, as well as ordinary citizens. They report impressive social and economic progress in the face of the enormous destruction left by the war, a "pioneering life" that is "difficult and at times discouraging," but everywhere "signs of a nation rebuilding" with commitment and dedication.

<P>Butterfield claims that "there is little verifiable information on the new economic zones -- no full-time American correspondents have been admitted since the war -- but they are evidently not popular." While it is true that American correspondents are not welcomed in Vietnam, there is nonetheless ample expert eyewitness testimony, including that of journalists of international repute, visiting Vietnamese professors from Canada, American missionaries and others who have traveled through the country where they worked for many years. Jean and Simonne Lacouture published a book in 1976 on a recent visit, critical of much of what they saw but giving a generally very positive account of reconstruction efforts and popular committment. Max Ediger of the Mennonite Central Committee, who worked in Vietnam for many years and stayed for thirteen months after the war, testified before Congress in March 1977 on a two-week return visit in January, also conveying a very favorable impression of the great progress he observed despite the "vast destruction of soil and facilities inflicted by the past war." There have also been positive accounts of the "new economic zones" in such journals as the <CITE>Far Eastern Economic Review</CITE> and the Canadian <CITE>Pacific Affairs</CITE>.

<P>But none of this extensive evidence appears in the<CITE> New York Times</CITE>'s analysis of "conditions in Indochina two years after the end of the war there." Nor is there any discussion in the Times of the "case of the missing bloodbath," although forecasts of a holocaust were urged by the U.S. leadership, official experts and the mass media over the entire course of the war in justifying our continued military presence. On the other hand, protests by some former anti-war individuals against alleged human rights violations in Vietnam are given generous coverage. This choice of subject may be the only basis on which U.S. -- as opposed to Soviet -- dissidents can get serious attention in the mass media today.

<P>The technical name for this farce is "freedom of the press." All are free to write as they wish: Fox Butterfield, with his ideological blinders, on the front page of the <CITE>Times</CITE> (daily circulation more than 800,000); and Carol Bragg, with her eyewitness testimony, in <CITE>New England Peacework</CITE> (circulation 2,500). Typically, reports which emphasize the destruction caused by the United States and the progress and commitment of the Vietnamese reach a tiny circle of peace activists. Reports that ignore the American role -- Butterfield can only bring himself to speak of "substantial tracts of land made fallow [sic] by the war," with no agent indicated -- and that find only "woes" and distress, reach a mass audience and become part of the established truth. In this way a "line" is implanted in the public mind with all the effectiveness of a system of censorship, while the illusion of an open press and society is maintained. If dictators were smarter, they would surely use the American system of thought control and indoctrination.

<P>It was inevitable with the failure of the American effort to subdue South Vietnam and to crush the mass movements elsewhere in Indochina, that there would be a campaign to reconstruct the history of these years so as to place the role of the United States in a more favorable light. The drab view of contemporary Vietnam provided by Butterfield and the establishment press helps to sustain the desired rewriting of history, asserting as it does the sad results of Communist success and American failure. Well suited for these aims are tales of Communist atrocities, which not only prove the evils of communism but undermine the credibility of those who opposed the war and might interfere with future crusades for freedom.

<P ALIGN = center>* * *

<P>It is in this context that we must view the recent spate of newspaper reports, editorials and books on Cambodia, a part of the world not ordinarily of great concern to the press. However, an exception is made when useful lessons may be drawn and public opinion mobilized in directions advantageous to the established order. Such didacticism often plays fast and loose with the truth.

<P>For example, on April 8, 1977, The <CITE>Washington Post</CITE> devoted half a page to "photographs believed to be the first of actual forced labor conditions in the countryside of Cambodia [to] have reached the West." The pictures show armed soldiers guarding people pulling plows, others working fields, and one bound man ("It is not known if this man was killed," the caption reads). Quite a sensational testimonial to Communist atrocities, but there is a slight problem. The <CITE>Washington Post</CITE> account of how they were smuggled out by a relative of the photographer who died in the escape is entirely fanciful. The pictures had appeared a year earlier in France, Germany and Australia, as well as in the <CITE>Bangkok Post</CITE> (April 19, 1976) with the caption "True or False?" In fact, an attempt by a Thai trader to sell these photos to the <CITE>Bangkok Post</CITE> was turned down "because the origin and authenticity of the photographs were in doubt." The photos appeared in another Thai newspaper two days before the April 4th election. The <CITE>Bangkok Post</CITE> then published them, explaining in an accompanying article that "Khmer watchers" were dubious about the clothes and manner of the people depicted, and quoting "other observers" who "pointed to the possibility that the series of pictures could have been taken in Thailand with the prime objective of destroying the image of the Socialist parties" before the election.

<P>This story was reported in the <CITE>U.S./Indochina Report</CITE> of the Indochina Resource Center in July 1976, along with the additional information that a Thai intelligence officer later admitted that the photos were indeed posed inside Thailand: "'Only the photographer and I were supposed to know,' he confided to a Thai journalist." The full details were given in the International Bulletin (April 25, 1977; circulation 6,000). A letter of April 20 to the <CITE>Washington Post</CITE> on these points has not appeared. In short, the "freedom of the press" assures that readers of the <CITE>International Bulletin</CITE> will get the facts.

<P>Even if the photographs had been authentic, we might ask why people should be pulling plows in Cambodia. The reason is clear, if unmentioned. The savage American assault on Cambodia did not spare the animal population. Hildebrand and Porter, in their <CITE>Cambodia: Starvation and Revolution</CITE>, cite a Cambodian Government report of April 1976 that several hundred thousand draft animals were killed in the rural areas. The <CITE>Post</CITE> did not have to resort to probable fabrications to depict the facts. A hundred-word item buried in <CITE>The New York Times</CITE> of June 14, 1976, cites an official U.N. report that teams of "human buffaloes" pull plows in Laos in areas where the buffalo herds, along with everything else, were decimated (by the American bombing, although this goes unmentioned in the <CITE>Times</CITE>. Much the same is true in Vietnam. Quite possibly the U.N. or the Laotian Government could supply photographic evidence, but this would not satisfy the needs of current propaganda.

<P>The response to the three books under review nicely illustrates this selection process. Hildebrand and Porter present a carefully documented study of the destructive American impact on Cambodia and the success of the Cambodian revolutionaries in overcoming it, giving a very favorable picture of their programs and policies, based on a wide range of sources. Published last year, and well received by the journal of the Asia Society (<CITE>Asia</CITE>, March-April 1977), it has not been reviewed in the <CITE>Times</CITE>, <CITE>New York Review </CITE>or any mass-media publication, nor used as the basis for editorial comment, with one exception. <CITE>The Wall Street Journal</CITE> acknowledged its existence in an editorial entitled "Cambodia Good Guys" (November 22, 1976), which dismissed contemptuously the very idea that the Khmer Rouge could play a constructive role, as well as the notion that the United States had a major hand in the destruction, death and turmoil of wartime and postwar Cambodia. In another editorial on the "Cambodian Horror" (April 16, 1976), the <CITE>Journal</CITE> editors speak of the attribution of postwar difficulties to U.S. intervention as "the record extension to date of the politics of guilt." On the subject of "Unscrambling Chile" (September 20, 1976), however, the abuses of the "manfully rebuilding" Chilean police state are explained away as an unfortunate consequence of Allendista "wrecking" of the economy.

<P>In brief, Hildebrand and Porter attribute "wrecking" and "rebuilding" to the wrong parties in Cambodia. In his Foreword to <CITE>Cambodia: Starvation and Revolution</CITE>, Asian scholar George Kahin observes that it is a book from which "anyone who is interested in understanding the situation obtaining in Phnom Penh before and after the Lon Nol government's collapse and the character and programs of the Cambodian Government that has replaced it will, I am sure, be grateful..." But the mass media are not grateful for the Hildebrand-Porter message, and have shielded the general public from such perceptions of Cambodia.

<P ALIGN = center>* * *

<P>In contrast, the media favorite, Barron and Paul's "untold story of Communist Genocide in Cambodia" (their subtitle), virtually ignores the U.S. Government role. When they speak of "the murder of a gentle land," they are not referring to B-52 attacks on villages or the systematic bombing and murderous ground sweeps by American troops or forces organized and supplied by the United States, in a land that had been largely removed from the conflict prior to the American attack. Their point of view can be predicted from the "diverse sources" on which they relied: namely, "informal briefings from specialists at the State and Defense Departments, the National Security Council and three foreign embassies in Washington." Their "Acknowledgements" mention only the expertise of Thai and Malaysian officials, U.S. Government Cambodian experts, and Father Ponchaud. They also claim to have analysed radio and refugee reports.

<P>Their scholarship collapses under the barest scrutiny. To cite a few cases, they state that among those evacuated from Phnom Penh, "virtually everybody saw the consequences of [summary executions] in the form of the corpses of men, women and children rapidly bloating and rotting in the hot sun," citing, among others, J.J. Cazaux, who wrote, in fact, that "not a single corpse was seen along our evacuation route," and that early reports of massacres proved fallacious (The <CITE>Washington Post</CITE>, May 9, 1975). They also cite <CITE>The New York Times</CITE>, May 9, 1975, where Sydney Shanberg wrote that "there have been unconfirmed reports of executions of senior military and civilian officials ... But none of this will apparently bear any resemblance to the mass executions that had been predicted by Westerners," and that "Here and there were bodies, but it was difficult to tell if they were people who had succumbed to the hardships of the march or simply civilians and soldiers killed in the last battles." They do not mention the Swedish journalist, Olle Tolgraven, or Richard Boyle of Pacific News Service, the last newsman to leave Cambodia, who denied the existence of wholesale executions; nor do they cite the testimony of Father Jacques Engelmann, a priest with nearly two decades of experience in Cambodia, who was evacuated at the same time and reported that evacuated priests "were not witness to any cruelties" and that there were deaths, but "not thousands, as certain newspapers have written" (cited by Hildebrand and Porter).

<P>Barron and Paul claim that there is no evidence of popular support for the Communists in the countryside and that people "fled to the cities" as a result of the "harsh regimen" imposed by the Communistrs -- not the American bombing. Extensive evidence to the contrary, including eyewitness reports and books by French and American correspondents and observers long familiar with Cambodia (e.g., Richard Dudman, Serge Thion, J.C. Pomonti, Charles Meyer) is never cited. Nor do they try to account for the amazingly rapid growth of the revolutionary forces from 1969 to 1973, as attested by U.S. intelligence and as is obvious from the unfolding events themselves.

<P>Their quotes, where they can be checked, are no more reliable. Thus they claim that Ponchaud attributes to a Khmer Rouge official the statement that people expelled from the cities "are no longer needed, and local chiefs are free to dispose of them as they please," implying that local chiefs are free to kill them. But Ponchaud's first report on this (Le Monde, February 18, 1976) quotes a military chief as stating that they "are left to the absolute discretion of the local authorities," which implies nothing of the sort.

<P>These examples are typical. Where there is no independent confirmatory evidence, the Barron-Paul story can hardly be regarded as credible. Their version of history has already appeared in the <CITE>Reader's Digest</CITE> (circulation more than 18 million), and has been widely cited in the mass media as an authoritative account, including among them, a front-page horror summary in the <CITE>Wall Street Journal</CITE>, an article in <CITE>TV Guide</CITE> (April 30, 1977; circulation more than 19 million) by Ernest Lefever, a foreign policy specialist who is otherwise known for his argument before Congress that we should be more tolerant of the "mistakes" of the Chilean junta "in attempting to clear away the devastation of the Allende period," and his discovery of the "remarkable freedom of expression" enjoyed by critics of the military regime (The <CITE>Miami Herald</CITE>, August 6, 1974).

<P>Ponchaud's book is based on his own personal experiences in Cambodia from 1965 until the capture of Phnom Penh, extensive interviews with refugees and reports from the Cambodian radio. Published in France in January 1977, it has become the best-known unread book in recent history, on the basis of an account by Jean Lacouture (in the <CITE>New York Review of Books</CITE>), widely cited since in the press, which alleges that Ponchaud has revealed a policy of "auto-genocide" (Lacouture's term) practiced by the Communists.

<P ALIGN = center>* * *

<P>Before looking more closely at Ponchaud's book and its press treatment, we would like to point out that apart from Hildebrand and Porter there are many other sources on recent events in Cambodia that have not been brought to the attention of the American reading public. Space limitations preclude a comprehensive review, but such journals as <CITE>the Far Eastern Economic Review</CITE>, the London <CITE>Economist</CITE>, the <CITE>Melbourne Journal of Politics</CITE>, and others elsewhere, have provided analyses by highly qualified specialists who have studied the full range of evidence available, and who concluded that executions have numbered at most in the thousands; that these were localized in areas of limited Khmer Rouge influence and unusual peasant discontent, where brutal revenge killings were aggravated by the threat of starvation resulting from the American destruction and killing. These reports also emphasize both the extraordinary brutality on both sides during the civil war (provoked by the American attack) and repeated discoveries that massacre reports were false. They also testify to the extreme unreliability of refugee reports, and the need to treat them with great caution, a fact that we and others have discussed elsewhere (cf. Chomsky: <CITE>At War with Asia</CITE>, on the problems of interpreting reports of refugees from American bombing in Laos). Refugees are frightened and defenseless, at the mercy of alien forces. They naturally tend to report what they believe their interlocuters wish to hear. While these reports must be considered seriously, care and caution are necessary. Specifically, refugees questioned by Westerners or Thais have a vested interest in reporting atrocities on the part of Cambodian revolutionaries, an obvious fact that no serious reporter will fail to take into account.

<P>To give an illustration of just one neglected source, the London <CITE>Economist</CITE> (March 26, 1977) carried a letter by W.J. Sampson, who worked as an economist and statistician for the Cambodian Government until March 1975, in close contact with the central statistics office. After leaving Cambodia, he writes, he "visited refugee camps in Thailand and kept in touch with Khmers," and he also relied on "A European friend who cycled around Phnom Penh for many days after its fall [and] saw and heard of no ... executions" apart from "the shooting of some prominent politicians and the lynching of hated bomber pilots in Phnom Penh." He concludes "that executions could be numbered in hundreds or thousands rather than in hundreds of thousands," though there was "a big death toll from sickness" -- surely a direct consequence, in large measure, of the devastation caused by the American attack. Sampson's analysis is known to those in the press who have cited Ponchaud at second-hand, but has yet to be reported here. And his estimate of executions is far from unique.

<P>Expert analyses of the sort just cited read quite differently from the confident conclusions of the mass media. Here we read the "Most foreign experts on Cambodia and its refugees believe at least 1.2 million persons have been killed or have died as a result of the Communist regime since April 17, 1975" (UPI, Boston Globe, April 17, 1977). No source is given, but it is interesting that a 1.2 million estimate is attributed by Ponchaud to the American Embassy (Presumably Bangkok), a completely worthless source, as the historical record amply demonstrates. The figure bears a suggestive similarity to the prediction by U.S. officials at the war's end that 1 million would die in the next year.

<P>In the<CITE> New York Times</CITE> <CITE>Magazine</CITE>, May 1, 1977, Robert Moss (editor of a dubious offshoot of Britain's <CITE>Economist</CITE> called "Foreign Report" which specializes in sensational rumors from the world's intelligence agencies) asserts that "Cambodia's pursuit of total revolution has resulted, by the official admission of its Head of State, Khieu Samphan, in the slaughter of a million people." Moss informs us that the source of this statement is Barron and Paul, who claim that in an interview with the Italian weekly <CITE>Famiglia Cristiana</CITE> Khieu Samphan stated that more than a million died during the war, and that the population had been 7 million before the war and is now 5 million. Even if one places some credence in the reported interview nowhere in it does Khieu Samphan suggest that the million postwar deaths were a result of official policies (as opposed to the lag effects of a war that left large numbers ill, injured, and on the verge of starvation). The "slaughter" by the Khmer Rouge is a Moss-<CITE>New York Times</CITE> creation.

<P>A <CITE>Christian Science Monitor</CITE> editorial states: "Reports put the loss of life as high as 2 million people out of 7.8 million total." Again, there is no source, but we will suggest a possibility directly. The<CITE> New York Times </CITE>analysis of "two years after the Communist victory" goes still further. David Andelman, May 2, 1977, speaks without qualification of "the purges that took hundreds of thousands of lives in the aftermath of the Communist capture of Phnom Penh on April 17, 1975." Even the U.S. Government sources on which journalists often uncritically rely advance no such claim, to our knowledge. In fact, even Barron and Paul claim only that "100,000 or more" were killed in massacres and executions -- they base their calculations on a variety of interesting assumptions, among them, that <I>all</I> military men, civil-servants and teachers were targeted for execution; curiously, their "calculations" lead them to the figure of 1.2 million deaths as a result of "actions" of the Khmer Rouge governing authorities, by January 1, 1977 ("at a very minimum"); by a coincidence, the number reported much earlier by the American Embassy, according to Ponchaud. Elsewhere in the press, similar numbers are bandied about, with equal credibility.

<P ALIGN = center>* * *

<P>Ponchaud's book is serious and worth reading, as distinct from much of the commentary it has elicited. He gives a grisly account of of what refugees have reported to him about the barbarity of their treatment at the hands of the Khmer Rouge. He also reminds us of some relevant history. For example, in this "peaceful land," peasants were massacred, their lands stolen and villages destroyed, by police and army in 1966, many then joining the <I>maquis</I> out of "their hatred for a government exercising such injustices and sowing death." He reports the enormous destruction and murder resulting directly from the American attack on Cambodia, the starvation and epidemics as the population was driven from their countryside by American military terror and the U.S.-incited civil war, leaving Cambodia with "an economy completely devastated by the war." He points out that "from the time of Sihanouk, then Lon Nol, the soldiers of the government army had already employed, with regard to their Khmer Rouge 'enemies,' bloodthirsty methods in no way different from those of Democratic Cambodia" (the Khmer Rouge). He also gives a rather positive account of Khmer Rouge programs of social and economic development, while deploring much brutal practice in working for egalitarian goals and national independence.

<P>Ponchaud's book lacks the documentation provided in Hildebrand and Porter and its veracity is therefore difficult to assess. But the serious reader will find much to make him somewhat wary. For one thing, Ponchaud plays fast and loose with quotes and with numbers. He quotes an unattributed Khmer Rouge slogan, "One or two million young people will be enough to build the new Cambodia." In an article in <CITE>Le Monde</CITE> (February 18, 1976) he gives what appears to be the same quote, this time as follows: "To rebuild the new Cambodia, a million people are enough." Here the quote is attributed to a Khmer Rouge military commander, along with the statement misrepresented by Barron and Paul, noted above (Lacouture changes the numbers to 1.5 million to 2 million, attributes the quote to an unnamed Marxist, and concludes that it goes beyond barbarism). This is one of the rare examples of a quote that can be checked. The results are not impressive.

<P>Ponchaud cites a Cambodian report that 200,000 people were killed in American bombings from March 7 to August 15, 1973. No source is offered, but suspicions are aroused by the fact that Phnom Penh radio announced on May 9, 1975 that there were 200,000 casualties of the American bombing in 1973, including "killed, wounded, and crippled for life" (Hildebrand and Porter). Ponchaud cites "Cambodian authorities" who give the figures 800,000 killed and 240,000 wounded before liberation. The figures are implausible. By the usual rule of thumb, wounded amount to about three times killed; quite possibly he has the figures reversed.

<P>More significant is Ponchaud's account of the evacuation of Phnom Penh in April 1975. He reports the explanation given by the revolutionary government: that the evacuation was motivated by impending famine. But this he rejects, on the ground that rice stocks in Phnom Penh would have sufficed for two months, with rationing (what he thinks would have happened after two months, with no new harvest, he does not say). He gives no source for this estimate, and fails to observe that "According to Long Boret, the old Government's last Premier, Phnom Penh had only eight days worth of rice on hand on the eve of the surrender" (Agence France-Presse, Bangkok; <CITE>New York Times</CITE>, May 9, 1975). Nor does he cite the testimony of U.S. AID officials that Phnom Penh had only a six-day supply of rice (William Goodfellow, <CITE>New York Times</CITE>, July 14, 1975).

<P>In fact, where an independent check is possible, Ponchaud's account seems at best careless, sometimes in rather significant ways. Nevertheless, the book is a serious work, however much the press has distorted it.

<P>As noted, Ponchaud relies overwhelmingly on refugee reports. Thus his account is at best second-hand with many of the refugees reporting what they claim to have heard from others. Lacouture's review gives at best a third-hand account. Commentary on Lacouture's review in the press, which has been extensive, gives a fourth-hand account. That is what is available to readers of the American press.

<P>As an instance, consider the <CITE>Christian Science Monitor</CITE> editorial already cited, which gives a fair sample of what is available to the American public. This editorial, based on Lacouture's review, speaks of the "reign of terror against the population" instituted by the Khmer Rouge. Lacouture, like Ponchaud, emphasizes the brutality of the American war, which laid the basis for all that followed. These references disappear from the <CITE>Monitor</CITE> editorial, which pretends that the current suffering in Cambodia takes place in an historical vacuum, as a mere result of Communist savagery. Similarly, an earlier editorial (January 26, 1977), based on Barron and Paul, also avoids any reference to American responsibility, though there is much moralizing about those who are indifferent to "one of the most brutal and concentrated onslaughts in history" in this "lovely land" of "engaging people."

<P ALIGN = center>* * *

<P>The newspaper report that elicited these judgements, on which the press uncritically relies, does appear in Ponchaud's book. The source, however, is not a Cambodian Government newspaper but a Thai newspaper, a considerable difference. The quoted paragraph was written by a Thai reporter who claims to have had an interview with a Khmer Rouge official. In his corrections, Lacouture notes the error, and adds that this Khmer Rouge official "said, as Ponchaud writes, that he found the revolutionary method of the Vietnamese 'very slow'..." A more accurate statement would be that the Thai reporter <I>claims</I> that that is what was said -- by now, a sufficiently remote chain of transmission to raise many doubts. How seriously would we regard a critical account of the United States in a book by a hostile European leftist based on a report in <CITE>Pravda</CITE> of a statement allegedly made by an unnamed American official? The analogy is precise. Why then should we rest any judgment on Ponchaud's account of a Thai report of an alleged statement by an unnamed Khmer Rouge official? What is certain is that the basis for Lacouture's accusations, cited above, disappears when the quotes are properly attributed: to a Thai reporter, not a Cambodian Government newspaper.

<P>Lacouture's review contained other errors, as he notes in his corrections. Thus he attributed to "texts distributed in Phnom Penh" what in fact appear to be slogans remembered by refugees, again a rather considerable difference. None of the examples he quotes is specifically attributed by Ponchaud.

<P>In his corrections, Lacouture raises the questions whether precision on these matters is very important. "Faced with an enterprise as monstrous as the new Cambodian Government, should we see the main problem as one of deciding exactly which person uttered an inhuman phrase, and whether the regime has murdered thousands of hundreds or thousands of wretched people?" He adds that it hardly matters what were the exact numbers of the victims of Dachau of Katyn. Or perhaps, we may add, whether the victims of My Lai numbered in the hundreds or tens of thousands, if a factor of 100 is unimportant.

<P>If, indeed, postwar Cambodia is, as he believes, similar to Nazi Germany, then his comment is perhaps just, though we may add that he has produced no evidence to support this judgement. But if postwar Cambodia is more similar to France after liberation, where many thousands of people were massacred within a few months under far less rigorous conditions than those left by the American war, then perhaps a rather different judgement is in order. That the latter conclusion may be more nearly correct is suggested by the analyses mentioned earlier.

<P>We disagree with Lacouture's judgement on the importance of precision on this question. It seems to us quite important, at this point in our understanding, to distinguish between official government texts and memories of slogans reported by refugees, between the statement that the regime "boasts" of having "killed" 2 million people and the claim by Western sources that something like a million have died -- particularly, when the bulk of these deaths are plausibly attributable to the United States. Similarly, it seems to us a very important question whether an "inhuman phrase" was uttered by a Thai reporter or a Khmer Rouge official. As for the numbers, it seems to us quite important to determine whether the number of collaborators massacred in France was on the order of thousands, and whether the French Government ordered and organized the massacre. Exactly such questions arise in the case of Cambodia.

<P ALIGN = center>* * *

<P>We do not pretend to know where the truth lies amidst these sharply conflicting assessments; rather, we again want to emphasize some crucial points. What filters through to the American public is a seriously distorted version of the evidence available, emphasizing alleged Khmer Rouge atrocities and downplaying or ignoring the crucial U.S. role, direct and indirect, in the torment that Cambodia has suffered. Evidence that focuses on the American role, like the Hildebrand and Porter volume, is ignored, not on the basis of truthfulness or scholarship but because the message is unpalatable.

<P>It is a fair generalization that the larger the number of deaths attributed to the Khmer Rouge, and the more the U.S. role is set aside, the larger the audience that will be reached. The Barron-Paul volume is a third-rate propaganda tract, but its exclusive focus on Communist terror assures it a huge audience. Ponchaud's far more substantial work has an anti-Communist bias and message, but it has attained stardom only via the extreme anti-Khmer Rouge distortions added to it in the article in the <CITE>New York Review of Books</CITE>. The last added the adequately large numbers executed and gave a "Left" authentication of Communist evil that assured a quantum leap to the mass audience unavailable to Hildebrand and Porter or to Carol Bragg. Contrary facts and even authors' corrections of misstatements are generally ignored or inadequately reported in favor of a useful lesson (we note one exception: an honest retraction of an editorial based on Lacouture in the <CITE>Boston Globe</CITE>. We noted earlier that the <CITE>Monitor</CITE> editorial and other press comments built on the Lacouture review offer at best a fourth-hand account. The chain of transmission runs from refugees (or Thai or U.S. officials), to Ponchaud, to the <CITE>New York Review</CITE>, to the press, where a mass audience is reached and "facts" are established that enter the approved version of history.

<H1>Leninism and State Capitalism</H1>

<P>Noam Chomsky

<P>From "Intellectuals and the State" (1977),
<BR>published in <CITE>Towards a New Cold War</CITE> (1982)
</CENTER>

<P>"The organization and the rule of society by socialist savants," [Bakunin]
wrote, "is the worst of all despotic governments." The leaders of the
Communist party will proceed "to liberate [the people] in their own way,"
concentrating "all administrative power in their own strong hands, because
the ignorant people are in need of a strong guardianship...[the mass of
the people will be] under the direct command of the state engineers, who
will constitute the new privileged political-scientific class." For the
proletariat, the new regime "will, in reality, be nothing but a barracks"
under the control of a Red bureaucracy. But surely it is "heresy against
common sense and historical experience" to believe the "a group of
individuals, even the most intelligent and best-intentioned, would be
capable of becoming the mind, the soul, the directing and unifying will of
the revolutionary movement and the economic organization of the proletariat
of all lands." In fact, the "learned minority, which presumes to express the
will of the people," will rule in "a pseudo-representative government" that
will "serve to conceal the domination of the masses by a handful of
privileged elite."...

<P>I need not dwell on the performance of Bakunin's Red bureaucracy when they
have succeeded in centralizing state power in their hands, riding to power
on a wave of popular movements that they have proceeded to dismantle and
finally destroy.

<P>I might also mention in this connection the penetrating studies by the Dutch
Marxist scientist Anton Pannekoek. Writing in the late 1930s and then under
the German occupation, he discussed "the social ideals growing up in the
minds of the intellectual class now that it feels its increasing importance
in the process of production: a well-ordered organization of production for
use under the direction of technical and scientific experts." These ideals,
he pointed out, are shared by the intelligentsia in capitalist societies and
by Communist intellectuals, whose aim is "to bring to power, by means of the
fighting force of the workers, a layer of leaders who then establish planned
production by means of State-Power." They develop the theory that "the
talented energetic minority takes the lead and the incapable majority
follows and obeys." Their natural social ideology is some version of state
socialism, "a design for reconstructing society on the basis of a working
class such as the middle class sees it and knows it under capitalism" --
tools of production, submissive, incapable of rational decision. To this
mentality, "an economic system where the workers are themselves masters and
leaders of their work...is identical with anarchy and chaos." But state
socialism, as conceived by the intellectuals, is a plan of social
organization "entirely different from a true disposal by the producers over
production," true socialism, a system in which workers are "masters of the
factories, masters of their own labor, to conduct it at their own will."...

<P>Lenin proclaimed in 1918 that "<I>unquestioning submission</I> to a single will is
absolutely necessary for the success of labour processes that are based on
large-scale machine-industry...today the Revolution demands, in the
interests of socialism, that the masses <I>unquestioningly obey the single will</I>
of the leaders of the labour process"; "there is not the least contradiction
between society (i.e., socialist) democracy and the use of dictatorial power
by a few persons." And two years later: "The transition to practical work is
connected with individual authority. This is the system which more than any
other assures the best utilization of human resources."

<P>Consider, in comparison, the following dictum:

<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
Vital decision-making, particularly in policy matters, must remain at the
top. God...is clearly democratic. He distributes brain power universally,
but He quite justifiably expects us to do something efficient and
constructive with that priceless gift. That is what management is all about.
Its medium is human capacity, and its most fundamental task is to deal with
change. It is the gate through which social, political, economic,
technological change, indeed change in every dimension, is rationally spread
through society...the real threat to democracy comes not from
overmanagement, but from undermanagement. To undermanage reality is not to
keep it free. It is simply to let some force other than reason shape reality
...if it is not reason that rules man, then man falls short of his
potential.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>In short, reason demands submission to centralized management: This is true
freedom, the realization of democracy. Apart from the reference to God, it
would be hard to tell whether the quote is from Lenin, or -- as indeed is
the case -- Robert McNamara, a typical example of the scientific and
educational estate in state capitalist democracy.

<P><H1>Notes on Anarchism</H1>

<P>Noam Chomsky, 1970
<BR>Published in <CITE>For Reasons of State</CITE> (1973)
</CENTER>


<P><P>A French writer, sympathetic to anarchism, wrote in the 1890s that "anarchism has a broad back, like paper it endures anything" -- including, he noted those whose acts are such that "a mortal enemy of anarchism could not have done better."<SUP><A NAME="TXT1" HREF="#FN1"><FONT SIZE=2>1</FONT></A></SUP> There have been many styles of thought and action that have been referred to as "anarchist." It would be hopeless to try to encompass all of these conflicting tendencies in some general theory or ideology. And even if we proceed to extract from the history of libertarian thought a living, evolving tradition, as Daniel Gu&#233;rin does in <CITE>Anarchism,</CITE> it remains difficult to formulate its doctrines as a specific and determinate theory of society and social change. The anarchist historian Rudolph Rocker, who presents a systematic conception of the development of anarchist thought towards anarchosyndicalism, along lines that bear comparison to Gu&#233;rins work, puts the matter well when he writes that anarchism is not

<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
a fixed, self-enclosed social system but rather a definite trend in the historic development of mankind, which, in contrast with the intellectual guardianship of all clerical and governmental institutions, strives for the free unhindered unfolding of all the individual and social forces in life. Even freedom is only a relative, not an absolute concept, since it tends constantly to become broader and to affect wider circles in more manifold ways. For the anarchist, freedom is not an abstract philosophical concept, but the vital concrete possibility for every human being to bring to full development all the powers, capacities, and talents with which nature has endowed him, and turn them to social account. The less this natural development of man is influenced by ecclesiastical or political guardianship, the more efficient and harmonious will human personality become, the more will it become the measure of the intellectual culture of the society in which it has grown.<SUP><A NAME="TXT2" HREF="#FN2"><FONT SIZE=2>2</FONT></A></SUP>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

One might ask what value there is in studying a "definite trend in the historic development of mankind" that does not articulate a specific and detailed social theory. Indeed, many commentators dismiss anarchism as utopian, formless, primitive, or otherwise incompatible with the realities of a complex society. One might, however, argue rather differently: that at every stage of history our concern must be to dismantle those forms of authority and oppression that survive from an era when they might have been justified in terms of the need for security or survival or economic development, but that now contribute to -- rather than alleviate -- material and cultural deficit. If so, there will be no doctrine of social change fixed for the present and future, nor even, necessarily, a specific and unchanging concept of the goals towards which social change should tend. Surely our understanding of the nature of man or of the range of viable social forms is so rudimentary that any far-reaching doctrine must be treated with great skepticism, just as skepticism is in order when we hear that "human nature" or "the demands of efficiency" or "the complexity of modern life" requires this or that form of oppression and autocratic rule.

<P>Nevertheless, at a particular time there is every reason to develop, insofar as our understanding permits, a specific realization of this definite trend in the historic development of mankind, appropriate to the tasks of the moment. For Rocker, "the problem that is set for our time is that of freeing man from the curse of economic exploitation and political and social enslavement"; and the method is not the conquest and exercise of state power, nor stultifying parliamentarianism, but rather "to reconstruct the economic life of the peoples from the ground up and build it up in the spirit of Socialism."

<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
But only the producers themselves are fitted for this task, since they are the only value-creating element in society out of which a new future can arise. Theirs must be the task of freeing labor from all the fetters which economic exploitation has fastened on it, of freeing society from all the institutions and procedure of political power, and of opening the way to an alliance of free groups of men and women based on co-operative labor and a planned administration of things in the interest of the community. To prepare the toiling masses in the city and country for this great goal and to bind them together as a militant force is the objective of modern Anarcho-syndicalism, and in this its whole purpose is exhausted. [P. 108]
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>As a socialist, Rocker would take for granted "that the serious, final, complete liberation of the workers is possible only upon one condition: that of the appropriation of capital, that is, of raw material and all the tools of labor, including land, by the whole body of the workers."<SUP><A NAME="TXT3" HREF="#FN3"><FONT SIZE=2>3</FONT></A></SUP> As an anarchosyndicalist, he insists, further, that the workers' organizations create "not only the ideas, but also the facts of the future itself" in the prerevolutionary period, that they embody in themselves the structure of the future society -- and he looks forward to a social revolution that will dismantle the state apparatus as well as expropriate the expropriators. "What we put in place of the government is industrial organization."

<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
Anarcho-syndicalists are convinced that a Socialist economic order cannot be created by the decrees and statutes of a government, but only by the solidaric collaboration of the workers with hand and brain in each special branch of production; that is, through the taking over of the management of all plants by the producers themselves under such form that the separate groups, plants, and branches of industry are independent members of the general economic organism and systematically carry on production and the distribution of the products in the interest of the community on the basis of free mutual agreements. [p. 94]
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Rocker was writing at a moment when such ideas had been put into practice in a dramatic way in the Spanish Revolution. Just prior to the outbreak of the revolution, the anarchosyndicalist economist Diego Abad de Santillan had written:

<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
...in facing the problem of social transformation, the Revolution cannot consider the state as a medium, but must depend on the organization of producers.

<P>We have followed this norm and we find no need for the hypothesis of a superior power to organized labor, in order to establish a new order of things. We would thank anyone to point out to us what function, if any, the State can have in an economic organization, where private property has been abolished and in which parasitism and special privilege have no place. The suppression of the State cannot be a languid affair; it must be the task of the Revolution to finish with the State. Either the Revolution gives social wealth to the producers in which case the producers organize themselves for due collective distribution and the State has nothing to do; or the Revolution does not give social wealth to the producers, in which case the Revolution has been a lie and the State would continue.

<P>Our federal council of economy is not a political power but an economic and administrative regulating power. It receives its orientation from below and operates in accordance with the resolutions of the regional and national assemblies. It is a liaison corps and nothing else.<SUP><A NAME="TXT4" HREF="#FN4"><FONT SIZE=2>4</FONT></A></SUP>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Engels, in a letter of 1883, expressed his disagreement with this conception as follows:

<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
The anarchists put the thing upside down. They declare that the proletarian revolution must <I>begin</I> by doing away with the political organization of the state....But to destroy it at such a moment would be to destroy the only organism by means of which the victorious proletariat can assert its newly-conquered power, hold down its capitalist adversaries, and carry out that economic revolution of society without which the whole victory must end in a new defeat and a mass slaughter of the workers similar to those after the Paris commune.<SUP><A NAME="TXT5" HREF="#FN5"><FONT SIZE=2>5</FONT></A></SUP>

In contrast, the anarchists -- most eloquently Bakunin -- warned of the dangers of the "red bureaucracy," which would prove to be "the most vile and terrible lie that our century has created."<SUP><A NAME="TXT6" HREF="#FN6"><FONT SIZE=2>6</FONT></A></SUP> The anarchosyndicalist Fernand Pelloutier asked: "Must even the transitory state to which we have to submit necessarily and fatally be a collectivist jail? Can't it consist in a free organization limited exclusively by the needs of production and consumption, all political institutions having disappeared?"<SUP><A NAME="TXT7" HREF="#FN7"><FONT SIZE=2>7</FONT></A></SUP>

<P>I do not pretend to know the answers to this question. But it seems clear that unless there is, in some form, a positive answer, the chances for a truly democratic revolution that will achieve the humanistic ideals of the left are not great. Martin Buber put the problem succinctly when he wrote: "One cannot in the nature of things expect a little tree that has been turned into a club to put forth leaves."<SUP><A NAME="TXT8" HREF="#FN8"><FONT SIZE=2>8</FONT></A></SUP> The question of conquest or destruction of state power is what Bakunin regarded as the primary issue dividing him from Marx.<SUP><A NAME="TXT9" HREF="#FN9"><FONT SIZE=2>9</FONT></A></SUP> In one form or another, the problem has arisen repeatedly in the century since, dividing "libertarian" from "authoritarian" socialists.

<P>Despite Bakunin's warnings about the red bureaucracy, and their fulfillment under Stalin's dictatorship, it would obviously be a gross error in interpreting the debates of a century ago to rely on the claims of contemporary social movements as to their historical origins. In particular, it is perverse to regard Bolshevism as "Marxism in practice." Rather, the left-wing critique of Bolshevism, taking account of the historical circumstances surrounding the Russian Revolution, is far more to the point.<SUP><A NAME="TXT10" HREF="#FN10"><FONT SIZE=2>10</FONT></A></SUP>

The anti-Bolshevik, left-wing labor movement opposed the Leninists because they did not go far enough in exploiting the Russian upheavals for strictly proletarian ends. They became prisoners of their environment and used the international radical movement to satisfy specifically Russian needs, which soon became synonymous with the needs of the Bolshevik Party-State. The "bourgeois" aspects of the Russian Revolution were now discovered in Bolshevism itself: Leninism was adjudged a part of international social-democracy, differing from the latter only on tactical issues.<SUP><A NAME="TXT11" HREF="#FN11"><FONT SIZE=2>11</FONT></A></SUP>

<P>If one were to seek a single leading idea within the anarchist tradition, it should, I believe, be that expressed by Bakunin when, in writing on the Paris Commune, he identified himself as follows:

<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
I am a fanatic lover of liberty, considering it as the unique condition under which intelligence, dignity and human happiness can develop and grow; not the purely formal liberty conceded, measured out and regulated by the State, an eternal lie which in reality represents nothing more than the privilege of some founded on the slavery of the rest; not the individualistic, egoistic, shabby, and fictitious liberty extolled by the School of J.-J. Rousseau and other schools of bourgeois liberalism, which considers the would-be rights of all men, represented by the State which limits the rights of each -- an idea that leads inevitably to the reduction of the rights of each to zero. No, I mean the only kind of liberty that is worthy of the name, liberty that consists in the full development of all the material, intellectual and moral powers that are latent in each person; liberty that recognizes no restrictions other than those determined by the laws of our own individual nature, which cannot properly be regarded as restrictions since these laws are not imposed by any outside legislator beside or above us, but are immanent and inherent, forming the very basis of our material, intellectual and moral being -- they do not limit us but are the real and immediate conditions of our freedom.<SUP><A NAME="TXT12" HREF="#FN12"><FONT SIZE=2>12</FONT></A></SUP>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>These ideas grew out of the Enlightenment; their roots are in Rousseau's <CITE>Discourse on Inequality,</CITE> Humboldt's <CITE>Limits of State Action,</CITE> Kant's insistence, in his defense of the French Revolution, that freedom is the precondition for acquiring the maturity for freedom, not a gift to be granted when such maturity is achieved. With the development of industrial capitalism, a new and unanticipated system of injustice, it is libertarian socialism that has preserved and extended the radical humanist message of the Enlightenment and the classical liberal ideals that were perverted into an ideology to sustain the emerging social order. In fact, on the very same assumptions that led classical liberalism to oppose the intervention of the state in social life, capitalist social relations are also intolerable.
This is clear, for example, from the classic work of Humboldt, <CITE>The Limits of State Action,</CITE> which anticipated and perhaps inspired Mill. This classic of liberal thought, completed in 1792, is in its essence profoundly, though prematurely, anticapitalist. Its ideas must be attenuated beyond recognition to be transmuted into an ideology of industrial capitalism.

<P>Humboldt's vision of a society in which social fetters are replaced by social bonds and labor is freely undertaken suggests the early Marx., with his discussion of the "alienation of labor when work is external to the worker...not part of his nature...[so that] he does not fulfill himself in his work but denies himself...[and is] physically exhausted and mentally debased," alienated labor that "casts some of the workers back into a barbarous kind of work and turns others into machines," thus depriving man of his "species character" of "free conscious activity" and "productive life." Similarly, Marx conceives of "a new type of human being who <I>needs</I> his fellow men....[The workers' association becomes] the real constructive effort to create the social texture of future human relations."<SUP><A NAME="TXT13" HREF="#FN13"><FONT SIZE=2>13</FONT></A></SUP> It is true that classical libertarian thought is opposed to state intervention in social life, as a consequence of deeper assumptions about the human need for liberty, diversity, and free association. On the same assumptions, capitalist relations of production, wage labor, competitiveness, the ideology of "possessive individualism" -- all must be regarded as fundamentally antihuman.
Libertarian socialism is properly to be regarded as the inheritor of the liberal ideals of the Enlightenment.

<P>Rudolf Rocker describes modern anarchism as "the confluence of the two great currents which during and since the French revolution have found such characteristic expression in the intellectual life of Europe: Socialism and Liberalism." The classical liberal ideals, he argues, were wrecked on the realities of capitalist economic forms. Anarchism is necessarily anticapitalist in that it "opposes the exploitation of man by man." But anarchism also opposes "the dominion of man over man." It insists that "<I>socialism will be free or it will not be at all.</I> In its recognition of this lies the genuine and profound justification for the existence of anarchism."<SUP><A NAME="TXT14" HREF="#FN14"><FONT SIZE=2>14</FONT></A></SUP> From this point of view, anarchism may be regarded as the libertarian wing of socialism. It is in this spirit that Daniel Gu&#233;rin has approached the study of anarchism in <CITE>Anarchism</CITE> and other works.<SUP><A NAME="TXT15" HREF="#FN15"><FONT SIZE=2>15</FONT></A></SUP> Gu&#233;rin quotes Adolph Fischer, who said that "every anarchist is a socialist but not every socialist is necessarily an anarchist." Similarly Bakunin, in his "anarchist manifesto" of 1865, the program of his projected international revolutionary fraternity, laid down the principle that each member must be, to begin with, a socialist.

<P>A consistent anarchist must oppose private ownership of the means of production and the wage slavery which is a component of this system, as incompatible with the principle that labor must be freely undertaken and under the control of the producer. As Marx put it, socialists look forward to a society in which labor will "become not only a means of life, but also the highest want in life,"<SUP><A NAME="TXT16" HREF="#FN16"><FONT SIZE=2>16</FONT></A></SUP> an impossibility when the worker is driven by external authority or need rather than inner impulse: "no form of wage-labor, even though one may be less obnoxious that another, can do away with the misery of wage-labor itself."<SUP><A NAME="TXT17" HREF="#FN17"><FONT SIZE=2>17</FONT></A></SUP> A consistent anarchist must oppose not only alienated labor but also the stupefying specialization of labor that takes place when the means for developing production

mutilate the worker into a fragment of a human being, degrade him to become a mere appurtenance of the machine, make his work such a torment that its essential meaning is destroyed; estrange from him the intellectual potentialities of the labor process in very proportion to the extent to which science is incorporated into it as an independent power...<SUP><A NAME="TXT18" HREF="#FN18"><FONT SIZE=2>18</FONT></A></SUP>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Marx saw this not as an inevitable concomitant of industrialization, but rather as a feature of capitalist relations of production. The society of the future must be concerned to "replace the detail-worker of today...reduced to a mere fragment of a man, by the fully developed individual, fit for a variety of labours...to whom the different social functions...are but so many modes of giving free scope to his own natural powers."<SUP><A NAME="TXT19" HREF="#FN19"><FONT SIZE=2>19</FONT></A></SUP> The prerequisite is the abolition of capital and wage labor as social categories (not to speak of the industrial armies of the "labor state" or the various modern forms of totalitarianism since capitalism).
The reduction of man to an appurtenance of the machine, a specialized tool of production, might in principle be overcome, rather than enhanced, with the proper development and use of technology, but not under the conditions of autocratic control of production by those who make man an instrument to serve their ends, overlooking his individual purposes, in Humboldt's phrase.

<P>Anarchosyndicalists sought, even under capitalism, to create "free associations of free producers" that would engage in militant struggle and prepare to take over the organization of production on a democratic basis. These associations would serve as "a practical school of anarchism."<SUP><A NAME="TXT20" HREF="#FN20"><FONT SIZE=2>20</FONT></A></SUP> If private ownership of the means of production is, in Proudhon's often quoted phrase, merely a form of "theft" -- "the exploitation of the weak by the strong"<SUP><A NAME="TXT21" HREF="#FN21"><FONT SIZE=2>21</FONT></A></SUP> -- control of production by a state bureaucracy, no matter how benevolent its intentions, also does not create the conditions under which labor, manual and intellectual, can become the highest want in life. Both, then, must be overcome.

<P>In his attack on the right of private or bureaucratic control over the means of production,, the anarchist takes his stand with those who struggle to bring about "the third and last emancipatory phase of history," the first having made serfs out of slaves, the second having made wage earners out of serfs, and the third which abolishes the proletariat in a final act of liberation that places control over the economy in the hands of free and voluntary associations of producers (Fourier, 1848).<SUP><A NAME="TXT22" HREF="#FN22"><FONT SIZE=2>22</FONT></A></SUP> The imminent danger to "civilization" was noted by de Tocqueville, also in 1848:

<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
As long as the right of property was the origin and groundwork of many other rights, it was easily defended -- or rather it was not attacked; it was then the citadel of society while all the other rights were its outworks; it did not bear the brunt of attack and, indeed, there was no serious attempt to assail it. but today, when the right of property is regarded as the last undestroyed remnant of the aristocratic world, when it alone is left standing, the sole privilege in an equalized society, it is a different matter. Consider what is happening in the hearts of the working-classes, although I admit they are quiet as yet. It is true that they are less inflamed than formerly by political passions properly speaking; but do you not see that their passions, far from being political, have become social? Do you not see that, little by little, ideas and opinions are spreading amongst them which aim not merely at removing such and such laws, such a ministry or such a government, but at breaking up the very foundations of society itself?<SUP><A NAME="TXT23" HREF="#FN23"><FONT SIZE=2>23</FONT></A></SUP>

<P>The workers of Paris, in 1871, broke the silence, and proceeded

<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
to abolish property, the basis of all civilization! Yes, gentlemen, the Commune intended to abolish that class property which makes the labor of the many the wealth of the few. It aimed at the expropriation of the expropriators. It wanted to make individual property a truth by transforming the means of production, land and capital, now chiefly the means of enslaving and exploiting labor, into mere instruments of free and associated labor.<SUP><A NAME="TXT24" HREF="#FN24"><FONT SIZE=2>24</FONT></A></SUP>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The Commune, of course, was drowned in blood. The nature of the "civilization" that the workers of Paris sought to overcome in their attack on "the very foundations of society itself" was revealed, once again, when the troops of the Versailles government reconquered Paris from its population. As Marx wrote, bitterly but accurately:

<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
The civilization and justice of bourgeois order comes out in its lurid light whenever the slaves and drudges of that order rise against their masters. Then this civilization and justice stand forth as undisguised savagery and lawless revenge...the infernal deeds of the soldiery reflect the innate spirit of that civilization of which they are the mercenary vindicators....The bourgeoisie of the whole world, which looks complacently upon the wholesale massacre after the battle, is convulsed by horror at the destruction of brick and mortar. [<CITE>Ibid.,</CITE> pp. 74, 77]
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Despite the violent destruction of the Commune, Bakunin wrote that Paris opens a new era, "that of the definitive and complete emancipation of the popular masses and their future true solidarity, across and despite state boundaries...the next revolution of man, international in solidarity, will be the resurrection of Paris" -- a revolution that the world still awaits.

<P>The consistent anarchist, then, should be a socialist, but a socialist of a particular sort. He will not only oppose alienated and specialized labor and look forward to the appropriation of capital by the whole body of workers, but he will also insist that this appropriation be direct, not exercised by some elite force acting in the name of the proletariat. He will, in short, oppose

<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
the organization of production by the Government. It means State-socialism, the command of the State officials over production and the command of managers, scientists, shop-officials in the shop....The goal of the working class is liberation from exploitation. This goal is not reached and cannot be reached by a new directing and governing class substituting itself for the bourgeoisie. It is only realized by the workers themselves being master over production.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>These remarks are taken from "Five Theses on the Class Struggle" by the left-wing Marxist Anton Pannekoek, one of the outstanding left theorists of the council communist movement. And in fact, radical Marxism merges with anarchist currents.

<P>As a further illustration, consider the following characterization of "revolutionary Socialism":

<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
The revolutionary Socialist denies that State ownership can end in anything other than a bureaucratic despotism. We have seen why the State cannot democratically control industry. Industry can only be democratically owned and controlled by the workers electing directly from their own ranks industrial administrative committees. Socialism will be fundamentally an industrial system; its constituencies will be of an industrial character. Thus those carrying on the social activities and industries of society will be directly represented in the local and central councils of social administration. In this way the powers of such delegates will flow upwards from those carrying on the work and conversant with the needs of the community. When the central administrative industrial committee meets it will represent every phase of social activity. Hence the capitalist political or geographical state will be replaced by the industrial administrative committee of Socialism. The transition from the one social system to the other will be the <I>social revolution.</I> The political State throughout history has meant the government <I>of men</I> by ruling classes; the Republic of Socialism will be the government <I>of industry</I> administered on behalf of the whole community. The former meant the economic and political subjection of the many; the latter will mean the economic freedom of all -- it will be, therefore, a true democracy.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This programmatic statement appears in William Paul's <CITE>The State, its Origins and Functions,</CITE> written in early 1917 -- shortly before Lenin's <CITE>State and Revolution,</CITE> perhaps his most libertarian work (see note 9). Paul was a member of the Marxist-De Leonist Socialist Labor Party and later one of the founders of the British Communist Party.<SUP><A NAME="TXT25" HREF="#FN25"><FONT SIZE=2>25</FONT></A></SUP> His critique of state socialism resembles the libertarian doctrine of the anarchists in its principle that since state ownership and management will lead to bureaucratic despotism, the social revolution must replace it by the industrial organization of society with direct workers' control. Many similar statements can be cited.

<P>What is far more important is that these ideas have been realized in spontaneous revolutionary action, for example in Germany and Italy after World War I and in Spain (not only in the agricultural countryside, but also in industrial Barcelona) in 1936. One might argue that some form of council communism is the natural form of revolutionary socialism in an industrial society. It reflects the intuitive understanding that democracy is severely limited when the industrial system is controlled by any form of autocratic elite, whether of owners, managers and technocrats, a "vanguard" party, or a state bureaucracy. Under these conditions of authoritarian domination the classical libertarian ideals developed further by Marx and Bakunin and all true revolutionaries cannot be realized; man will not be free to develop his own potentialities to their fullest, and the producer will remain "a fragment of a human being," degraded, a tool in the productive process directed from above.

<P>The phrase "spontaneous revolutionary action" can be misleading. The anarchosyndicalists, at least, took very seriously Bakunin's remark that the workers' organizations must create "not only the ideas but also the facts of the future itself" in the prerevolutionary period. The accomplishments of the popular revolution in Spain, in particular, were based on the patient work of many years of organization and education, one component of a long tradition of commitment and militancy. The resolutions of the Madrid Congress of June 1931 and the Saragossa Congress in May 1936 foreshadowed in many ways the acts of the revolution, as did the somewhat different ideas sketched by Santillan (see note 4) in his fairly specific account of the social and economic organization to be instituted by the revolution. Gu&#233;rin writes "The Spanish revolution was relatively mature in the minds of libertarian thinkers, as in the popular consciousness." And workers' organizations existed with the structure, the experience, and the understanding to undertake the task of social reconstruction when, with the Franco coup, the turmoil of early 1936 exploded into social revolution.
In his introduction to a collection of documents on collectivization in Spain, the anarchist Augustin Souchy writes:

<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
For many years, the anarchists and the syndicalists of Spain considered their supreme task to be the social transformation of the society. In their assemblies of Syndicates and groups, in their journals, their brochures and books, the problem of the social revolution was discussed incessantly and in a systematic fashion.<SUP><A NAME="TXT26" HREF="#FN26"><FONT SIZE=2>26</FONT></A></SUP>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>All of this lies behind the spontaneous achievements, the constructive work of the Spanish Revolution.

<P>The ideas of libertarian socialism, in the sense described, have been submerged in the industrial societies of the past half-century. The dominant ideologies have been those of state socialism or state capitalism (of increasingly militarized character in the United States, for reasons that are not obscure).<SUP><A NAME="TXT27" HREF="#FN27"><FONT SIZE=2>27</FONT></A></SUP> But there has been a rekindling of interest in the past few years. The theses I quoted by Anton Pannekoek were taken from a recent pamphlet of a radical French workers' group (<CITE>Informations Correspondance Ouvri&#232;re</CITE>). The remarks by William Paul on revolutionary socialism are cited in a paper by Walter Kendall given at the National Conference on Workers' Control in Sheffield, England, in March 1969. The workers' control movement has become a significant force in England in the past few years. It has organized several conferences and has produced a substantial pamphlet literature, and counts among its active adherents representatives of some of the most important trade unions. The Amalgamated Engineering and Foundryworkers' Union, for example, has adopted, as official policy, the program of nationalization of basic industries under "workers' control at all levels."<SUP><A NAME="TXT28" HREF="#FN28"><FONT SIZE=2>28</FONT></A></SUP> On the Continent, there are similar developments. May 1968 of course accelerated the growing interest in council communism and related ideas in France and Germany, as it did in England.

<P>Given the highly conservative cast of our highly ideological society, it is not too surprising that the United States has been relatively untouched by these developments. But that too may change. The erosion of cold-war mythology at least makes it possible to raise these questions in fairly broad circles. If the present wave of repression can be beaten back, if the left can overcome its more suicidal tendencies and build upon what has been accomplished in the past decade, then the problem of how to organize industrial society on truly democratic lines, with democratic control in the workplace and in the community, should become a dominant intellectual issue for those who are alive to the problems of contemporary society, and, as a mass movement for libertarian socialism develops, speculation should proceed to action.

<P>In his manifesto of 1865, Bakunin predicted that one element in the social revolution will be "that intelligent and truly noble part of youth which, though belonging by birth to the privileged classes, in its generous convictions and ardent aspirations, adopts the cause of the people." Perhaps in the rise of the student movement of the 1960s one sees steps towards a fulfillment of this prophecy.

<P>Daniel Gu&#233;rin has undertaken what he has described as a "process of rehabilitation" of anarchism. He argues, convincingly I believe, that "the constructive ideas of anarchism retain their vitality, that they may, when re-examined and sifted, assist contemporary socialist thought to undertake a new departure...[and] contribute to enriching Marxism."<SUP><A NAME="TXT29" HREF="#FN29"><FONT SIZE=2>29</FONT></A></SUP> From the "broad back" of anarchism he has selected for more intensive scrutiny those ideas and actions that can be described as libertarian socialist. This is natural and proper. This framework accommodates the major anarchist spokesmen as well as the mass actions that have been animated by anarchist sentiments and ideals. Gu&#233;rin is concerned not only with anarchist thought but also with the spontaneous actions of popular revolutionary struggle. He is concerned with social as well as intellectual creativity. Furthermore, he attempts to draw from the constructive achievements of the past lessons that will enrich the theory of social liberation. For those who wish not only to understand the world, but also to change it, this is the proper way to study the history of anarchism.

<P>Gu&#233;rin describes the anarchism of the nineteenth century as essentially doctrinal, while the twentieth century, for the anarchists, has been a time of "revolutionary practice."<SUP><A NAME="TXT30" HREF="#FN30"><FONT SIZE=2>30</FONT></A></SUP> <CITE>Anarchism</CITE> reflects that judgment. His interpretation of anarchism consciously points toward the future. Arthur Rosenberg once pointed out that popular revolutions characteristically seek to replace "a feudal or centralized authority ruling by force" with some form of communal system which "implies the destruction and disappearance of the old form of State." Such a system will be either socialist or an "extreme form of democracy...[which is] the preliminary condition for Socialism inasmuch as Socialism can only be realized in a world enjoying the highest possible measure of individual freedom." This ideal, he notes, was common to Marx and the anarchists.<SUP><A NAME="TXT31" HREF="#FN31"><FONT SIZE=2>31</FONT></A></SUP> This natural struggle for liberation runs counter to the prevailing tendency towards centralization in economic and political life.

<P>A century ago Marx wrote that the workers of Paris "felt there was but one alternative -- the Commune, or the empire -- under whatever name it might reappear."

<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
The empire had ruined them economically by the havoc it made of public wealth, by the wholesale financial swindling it fostered, by the props it lent to the artificially accelerated centralization of capital, and the concomitant expropriation of their own ranks. It had suppressed them politically, it had shocked them morally by its orgies, it had insulted their Voltairianism by handing over the education of their children to the <I>fr&#232;res Ignorantins,</I> it had revolted their national feeling as Frenchmen by precipitating them headlong into a war which left only one equivalent for the ruins it made -- the disappearance of the empire.<SUP><A NAME="TXT32" HREF="#FN32"><FONT SIZE=2>32</FONT></A></SUP>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The miserable Second Empire "was the only form of government possible at a time when the bourgeoisie had already lost, and the working class had not yet acquired, the faculty of ruling the nation."

<P>It is not very difficult to rephrase these remarks so that they become appropriate to the imperial systems of 1970. The problem of "freeing man from the curse of economic exploitation and political and social enslavement" remains the problem of our time. As long as this is so, the doctrines and the revolutionary practice of libertarian socialism will serve as an inspiration and guide.

<P><A NAME="FN18" HREF="#TXT18">18</A> Karl Marx, <CITE>Capital,</CITE> quoted by Robert Tucker, who rightly emphasizes that Marx sees the revolutionary more as a "frustrated producer" than a "dissatisfied consumer" (<CITE>The Marxian Revolutionary Idea</CITE>). This more radical critique of capitalist relations of production is a direct outgrowth of the libertarian thought of the Enlightenment.

<P><A NAME="FN21" HREF="#TXT21">21</A> "Qu'est-ce que la propri&#233;t&#233;?" The phrase "property is theft" displeased Marx, who saw in its use a logical problem, theft presupposing the legitimate existence of property. See Avineri, <CITE>Social and Political Thought of Marx.</CITE>

<HEAD><TITLE>About the Chomsky Archive</TITLE>
<BODY BGCOLOR="white" LINK="4F4F87" VLINK="72348F" ALINK="4C8F4D">

<H2 ALIGN=center>History of the Archive</H1>


<P>The Noam Chomsky Archive began as an effort to consolidate all of Chomsky's work available in the public domain. The original archive, put together by <A HREF="mailto:jimmer+@cmu.edu">Jimmer Endres</A>, contained many of the interviews, lectures, and Z Magazine articles, and even then constituted over 3 megabytes. Originally located on a different server, it moved to the <A HREF="http://www.lbbs.org/">ZNet</A> site in 1995, where it sat alongside two major publishers of Chomsky's work, <A HREF="http://www.lbbs.org/zmag/index.htm">Z Magazine</A> and <A HREF="http://www.lbbs.org/sep/sep.htm">South End Press</A>. You can still access that version of the archive by going to it directly at <A HREF="http://www.lbbs.org/archive/index.htm">http://www.lbbs.org/archive/index.htm</A>.

<P>During this time, <A HREF="mailto:jeremy@allaire.com">Jeremy Allaire</A> worked with Noam, Noam's wife Carol, and several publishers to make <A HREF="http://www.worldmedia.com/">New World Media</A> the on-line publisher of several of Chomsky's books. At the beginning of 1996, ZNet and New World Media came together to co-sponsor the new and improved Noam Chomsky Archive.

<P>The current archive features all of the original material reformatted in HTML, plus books from Common Courage Press, Hill and Wang, Odonian Press, and <A HREF="http://www.lbbs.org/sep/sep.htm">South End Press</A>. Altogether it consumes nearly eight megabytes. <A HREF="mailto:tl001c@uhura.cc.rochester.edu">Tom Lane</A> maintains the current archive, and welcomes your comments.

<P>The publishers wish for this material to reach and inspire as many people as possible, but they also must continue to generate revenue. As such, if you enjoy what you see, please consider purchasing a hard copy of the book or a subscription to <A HREF="http://www.lbbs.org/zmag/index.htm">Z Magazine</A>. (If you enjoy this material, you will certainly enjoy Z Magazine, which Chomsky regularly writes for.) Some of the larger books are broken into segments of about eight paragraphs each to offer a little bit of futher incentive to purchase the hard copy. However, feel free to excerpt portions of the work (in e-mail, newsgroup posts, etc.), as long as you include the publisher information and a line saying "From the Noam Chomsky Archive, http://www.worldmedia.com/archive/". If you wish to excerpt more than 500 words, or have any questions about the copyright, please contact the publisher.

<P>In the future the archive will feature:

<UL>
<LI>More books

<LI>RealAudio selections from speeches

<LI>Chomsky's speaking schedule

<LI>Search capabilities

<LI>A complete index

<LI>Hopefully much more!
</UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=+1>So you want to contribute or give feedback?  EXCELLENT.  MADNESS welcomes any type of suggestion or contribution, from the downright stupid to the upright brilliant.  Before you put the proverbial quill to the proverbial parchment, there are a couple things you should consider:</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<OL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=+2>U</FONT>nless you specify otherwise, all submissions and suggestions may be made public.  If you want to send private e-mail or suggestions, just put somewhere in the message that it's not for public consumption.
<P>
<LI><FONT SIZE=+2>I</FONT>f you are making suggestions for next week's installment or tossing some ideas for plot or character development your message may be any length.  If you are making SUBMISSIONS, however (i.e. word-for-word character suggestions, lists of character traits, background anecdotes--anything you'd like to be printed AS-IS), please keep it short--500 words or so is good for a top limit.  Remember: <FONT SIZE=+1>I have the right to edit everything.</FONT> I'll run any changes by you so that you can okay them before your piece goes up.
<P> 
<LI><FONT SIZE=+2>K</FONT>eep the submissions reasonable if you can.  I like a alien abduction or group sex story as much as the next guy, but unless the plot calls for it (and hey, it might) try not to get too weird.
<P>
<LI><FONT SIZE=+2>E</FONT>verything that you submit becomes property of MADNESS.

<FONT SIZE=+3>Dr. JAY SAND III, esq.</FONT> 
<BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="me.jpg"><BR>
</CENTER>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=+2>
Jay Sand is a journeyman writer, musician and all-around sooper dooper guy.  Here he is, in fact, looking quite serious and respectful in his natural habitat -- on the couch in his apartment.  This picture is from last October, way back when the plant was still alive.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<A NAME="home">
Jay Sand was born and raised in the ho hum capital of the world, Harrisburg Pennsylvania.  Say <A HREF="hpautho1.htm">hello</A> to his youth.
<P><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=+1>
Jay attended the Harrisburg Academy in Wormleysburg, PA (right across the Harvey Taylor Bridge from downtown H-burg itself) from first grade until he graduated high school.  Jay learned three important lessons in school: </FONT></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2>
1) You must study hard and use your mind if you want to go far<P>
2) Try your darndest and you will succeed in whatever you set out to do, and<P>
3) Never drink whiskey before gym class, especially on dodgeball day.
</FONT>
<P>
<IMG SRC="yahtze2.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=5>
<FONT SIZE=+1>
Jay moved gracefully from the Harrisburg Academy to the University of Pennsylvania where he studied American History, played quarterback for the school's undefeated Ivy League Champion football team and learned to lie voraciously.  This skill helped him tremendously in the writing of his Senior Honors Thesis, <I><A HREF="http://www.dorsai.org/~wbai/fass/index.html">The Radio Waves Unnameable</A></I>, a landmark study of counterculture radio station WBAI and its role in developing the social movements of the late '60s, and in occasionally covering social protest issues for Philadelphia's largest regional newsweekly, <I><A HREF="http://www.cpcn.com">City Paper</A></I>.</FONT>
<P>
Jay currently spends most of his time putting together <FONT SIZE=+2><A HREF="../index.htm" TARGET="_top">MADNESS</A></FONT>, the Web's premier work of subversive cyberfiction (he gets a great kick out of creating MADNESS every week, and though many folks enjoy it he must admit that he does it mainly for himself), playing guitar under a number of pseudonyms in clubs all around the Northeast and writing articles about non-violent direct action and social protest issues.  He is unnaturally concerned with making his mark on the world, and will keep dreaming big dreams until someone slaps some sense into him.
<P>
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1>
Jay Sand is currently available for weddings, bar mitzvahs and ship christenings.  You may contact him at <A HREF="mailto:jay@user1.channel1.com">jay@user1.channel1.com</A> with your own rants, raves, dreams and desires.  Meanwhile, click the arrows below:
