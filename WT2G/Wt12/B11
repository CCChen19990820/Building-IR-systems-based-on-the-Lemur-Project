<BR>
<a href="mailto:ccoy@aqmd.gov"><IMG src="/icon/mails.gif" alt="Mail" border=2
    align=top></a>(ccoy@aqmd.gov )

<P>Proposed amendments will extend the compliance dates for several types of adhesive bonding primers, fuel tank coatings, solid-film lubricants and primer coatings from 1997 to either 1998, 2000 or 2002 because compliant coatings have not been qualified by all major aerospace companies. In addition, the VOC limits are proposed to be decreased for dry lubricative coatings. This is scheduled for review by the Stationary Source Committee on November 22, 1996.
<P><b> 3.
<a href = "96113a.html">
Set Public Hearing December 13, 1996 to 
  Amend Rule 1130.1 - Screen Printing Operations</a>
</b>

<BR>
<A HREF="mailto:jbroadbent@aqmd.gov"><IMG Align = Top SRC = "/icon/mails.gif"
    ALT = "Mail"></A>(jbroadbent@aqmd.gov )


<P>Proposed amendments will address concerns raised by the industry, ink manufacturers, and staff by creating higher VOC limits for various screen printing operations and postponing the implementation of the lower VOC limit for extreme performance applications. The amendments will result in a permanent emission reduction loss of 0.1 ton per day and delay the 0.28 ton per day emission reduction associated with extreme performance applications from 1998 to 2003.

<P><b> 4.  <a href = "96114a.html">Set Public Hearing December 13, 1996 to Amend 
  Rule 219 - Equipment Not Requiring a Written Permit 
  Pursuant to Regulation II</a>
</b>
<br>Broadbent (909) 396-3789
<BR>
<A HREF="mailto:jbroadbent@aqmd.gov"><IMG Align = Top SRC = "/icon/mails.gif"
    ALT = "Mail"></A>(jbroadbent@aqmd.gov )

<P>Rule 219 identifies equipment and processes which are exempt from AQMD written permits. The proposed amendments focus on implementing the first tier of the 1996 AQMD Regulatory Reform Initiative to &quot;eliminate permits for small businesses&quot; by removing approximately 10,000 permits from the system and reducing the number of expected new applications by 1,000/year. The proposal would also require permits for all equipment subject to state Air Toxic Control Measures and federal NESHAP. This was reviewed by the Stationary Source Committee September 20, 1996. Fiscal impact will be reviewed by the Administrative Committee October 18, 1996.
<P><center><B><I>Budget/Fiscal Impact</I></B></center>
<P><b> 5.  Execute Contract for Investment Consultant Services
</b>
<br>Pearce (909) 396-2828
<BR>
<A HREF="mailto:rpearce@aqmd.gov"><IMG Align = Top SRC = "/icon/mails.gif"
    ALT = "Mail"></A>(rpearce@aqmd.gov )

<P>This action is to execute a contract in the sum of $53,000 to Sperry Capital Inc. to provide investment consultant services for three years to assist in the development of AQMD&#146;s Investment Policy and Guidelines and to provide investment monitoring and compliance reporting services. This was reviewed by the Investment Oversight Committee on November 1, 1996 and recommended for approval.

<P><b> 6.  <a href = "96116a.html">Amend Contract with Telos Consulting Services and Issue an RFP for Short- and Long-Term Systems Development and Maintenance Support</a>
</b>
<br>Mathur (909) 396-2722
<br><a href="mailto:vmathur@aqmd.gov"><img src="/icon/mails.gif" alt="Mail" border=2  align=top></a>(vmathur@aqmd.gov
)

<P>Systems development contracts previously approved by the Board culminated in the recent system migration. These systems will require further development as well as routine maintenance to meet evolving needs. This action is to release an RFP to solicit bids for post-migration services. However, to rapidly integrate essential system enhancements, this action also is to modify the current Telos Consulting Services contract to add $100,000. Funds for these services in the amount of $400,000 are included in the approved FY 1996-97 Budget. This was reviewed by the Administrative Committee on October 18, 1996, and recommended for approval.
<P><b> 7. <a href = "96117a.html">Provide Additional Funding for Technical Support of AQMD&#146;s Technology Advancement Program</a>
  <I>(Continued from October 11, 1996 Board Meeting)</I>

<br><a href = "mailto:cliu@aqmd.gov"><IMG src="/icon/mails.gif" alt="Mail" border=2
    align=top></a>(cliu@aqmd.gov)

<P>Since 1988, AQMD&#146;s Technology Advancement (TA) program has co-sponsored hundreds of development, demonstration, and research projects designed to expedite wide-scale use of progressively cleaner technologies and fuels. To optimize the effectiveness of this program, it has been advantageous to supplement in-house technical resources and expertise with outside assistance. A total of $51,500 in FY 1996-97 funding is proposed to amend two level-of-effort contracts to provide ongoing technical support for the TA program. This was reviewed by the Technology Committee on September 27, 1996 and by the Administrative Committee on October 18, 1996 and both recommended for approval.

<P><b> 8.  <a href = "96118a.html">Establish Lists of Pre-Qualified Vendors to Provide Recycled Copy Paper, Printing Services, Miscellaneous Printing Paper Stock, Unleaded Fuel, and Automotive Mechanical Repair and Service</a>

<br><a href = "mailto:jcontaoi@aqmd.gov"><IMG src="/icon/mails.gif" alt="Mail" border=2
    align=top></a>(jcontaoi@aqmd.gov)

<P>On July 12, 1996, the Board approved the release of RFQs to solicit bids from various vendors to establish lists of pre-qualified vendors from whom the AQMD would purchase various non-consultant services and supplies. This action is to establish pre-qualified vendor lists that will be used for the purchase of recycled copy paper, printing services, miscellaneous printing paper stock, unleaded fuel, and automotive mechanical repair and service as needed for a twelve-month period. This was reviewed by the Administrative Committee on October 18, 1996, and recommended for approval.

<P><b> 9.  <a href = "96119a.html">Issue an RFP to Implement the Design for 
  New Permit Streamlining System</a>

<br><a href="mailto:vmathur@aqmd.gov"><img src="/icon/mails.gif" alt="Mail" border=2  align=top></a>(vmathur@aqmd.gov
)


<P>The Business Clean Air Partnership and Regulatory Reform Initiative both include a strong focus on streamlined permitting. A detailed design was developed for a system to electronically receive and process permits for common equipment types that do not trigger offsets or toxic requirements. This action is to issue an RFP to solicit bids for the development of a system allowing submittal of equipment certification applications through the AQMD&#146;s Internet Homepage. The FY 1996-97 budget includes $80,000 for this permit streamlining contract. This was reviewed by the Administrative Committee on October 18, 1996, and recommended for approval.

<P><b>10.  <a href = "961110a.html">Approve Disposal of Obsolete or Non-Repairable Office Equipment and Furnishings

<P>Certain office equipment and furnishings are obsolete, or are damaged and cannot be economically repaired. AQMD&#146;s Contracting and Purchasing Policy provides that the Purchasing Manager may, by direct sales or otherwise, sell or dispose of any personal property belonging to the AQMD. This action is to authorize: (a) the deletion of the fixed assets from AQMD&#146;s inventory, and (b) the disposal, by direct sales, public auction, or donation, of the deleted fixed assets and other obsolete or non-repairable equipment and furnishings. This was reviewed by the Administrative Committee on October 18, 1996, and recommended for approval.

<P>Proposed amendments will address concerns raised by the industry, ink manufacturers, and staff by creating higher VOC limits for various screen printing operations and postponing the implementation of the lower VOC limit for extreme performance applications. The amendments will result in a permanent emission reduction loss of 0.1 ton per day and delay the 0.28 ton per day emission reduction associated with extreme performance applications from 1998 to 2003.

<P><b> 4.  <a href = "96114a.html">Set Public Hearing December 13, 1996 to Amend

<A HREF="mailto:jbroadbent@aqmd.gov"><IMG Align = Top SRC = "/icon/mails.gif"

<P>Rule 219 identifies equipment and processes which are exempt from AQMD written permits. The proposed amendments focus on implementing the first tier of the 1996 AQMD Regulatory Reform Initiative to &quot;eliminate permits for small businesses&quot; by removing approximately 10,000 permits from the system and reducing the number of expected new applications by 1,000/year. The proposal would also require permits for all equipment subject to state Air Toxic Control Measures and federal NESHAP. This was reviewed by the Stationary Source Committee September 20, 1996. Fiscal impact will be reviewed by the Administrative Committee October 18, 1996.

<P>Systems development contracts previously approved by the Board culminated in the recent system migration. These systems will require further development as well as routine maintenance to meet evolving needs. This action is to release an RFP to solicit bids for post-migration services. However, to rapidly integrate essential system enhancements, this action also is to modify the current Telos Consulting Services contract to add $100,000.

<P>Since 1988, AQMD&#146;s Technology Advancement (TA) program has co-sponsored hundreds of development, demonstration, and research projects designed to expedite wide-scale use of progressively cleaner technologies and fuels. To optimize the effectiveness of this program, it has been advantageous to supplement in-house technical resources and expertise with outside assistance. A total of $51,500 in FY 1996-97 funding is proposed to amend two level-of-effort contracts to provide ongoing technical support for the TA program. This was reviewed by the Technology Committee on September 27, 1996 and by the Administrative Committee on October 18, 1996 and both recommended for approval.

<P>On July 12, 1996, the Board approved the release of RFQs to solicit bids from various vendors to establish lists of pre-qualified vendors from whom the AQMD would purchase various non-consultant services and supplies. This action is to establish pre-qualified vendor lists that will be used for the purchase of recycled copy paper, printing services, miscellaneous printing paper stock, unleaded fuel, and automotive mechanical repair and service as needed for a twelve-month period.

<P>The Business Clean Air Partnership and Regulatory Reform Initiative both include a strong focus on streamlined permitting. A detailed design was developed for a system to electronically receive and process permits for common equipment types that do not trigger offsets or toxic requirements. This action is to issue an RFP to solicit bids for the development of a system allowing submittal of equipment certification applications through the AQMD&#146;s Internet Homepage. The FY 1996-97 budget includes $80,000 for this permit streamlining contract. This was reviewed by the Administrative Committee on October 18, 1996, and recommended for approval.

<hr>
<p>
<B>Background</B>
<P>Travel arrangements for AQMD-related travel are handled by an external travel agency. At its September 13, 1996 meeting, the Governing Board approved issuing an RFP to provide travel agencies the opportunity to compete for the AQMD's travel business.  For FY 1996-97, it is estimated that AQMD&#146;s travel and related expenditures will be approximately $190,000.
<p>
<B>Proposal</B>
<P>In accordance with the AQMD's Consultant Selection Policy and Procedure, a public notice inviting proposals was published in the<B> </B>California State Contracts Register, Chinese Daily News, Eastern Group Publications, El Chicano, Inland Empire Hispanic News, Inland Valley Daily Bulletin, Korean Central Daily, La Opinion, La Voz, Los Angeles Sentinel, Los Angeles Times, M/W/DVBE Source, Orange County Register, Philippine News, Precinct Reporter, Rafu Shimpo, Riverside Press-Enterprise, San Bernardino Sun, The Black Voice News, The Excelsior, the Purchasing RFP/RFQ 24-hour Phone Line, and the World Wide Web.  Additionally, copies of the RFP were sent to the Latino and Black Legislative Caucuses, and various minority chambers of commerce and business associations.  A total of 85 RFPs were mailed in response to direct noticing and advertisement of the proposed RFP.
<P>Four firms responded to the RFP.  The proposals were reviewed by an evaluation panel composed of staff from the Executive Office and Finance. The panel was composed of four females; one Asian Indian American, one Asian Pacific American, and two Caucasians.  The evaluation results for the bidders are:

<P>(1) To receive preference points in the evaluation process for being MBE, WBE or DVBE the bidder must submit evidence of certification by an agency whose certification meets the requirements of 49 C.F.R., Part 23 (for example, 8(a) Certification of the Small Business Administration or Certification by Cal Trans).   Since AMT Travel did not submit evidence of such certification, no preference points were awarded.  Since no preference points were awarded, the provisions of Proposition 209 are not violated.
<P>The selection criteria used to rank the proposals included responsiveness of the proposal; understanding of the services required; agency/management/organization/staffing, approach to providing the services and level of services provided; previously related experience and references; response to sample itinerary requests and Local business designation.  While both responsive firms were qualified to provide travel services, Bonneville Travel scored significantly higher and the panel selected Bonneville Travel to be recommended to the Board.
<P>Bonneville Travel, LLC has the ability to provide very competitive rates for travel and related expenditures.  Bonneville has provided travel agency services to the AQMD for the past three years and has demonstrated an exceptionally high level of service orientation and attention to the constraints of business travel.  The firm also has committed to providing the convenience of an satellite ticket printer at the AQMD headquarters. 
<p>
<B>Resource Impacts</B>

<P>There is no budget impact on the selection of the travel agency since the services are paid through commissions received from the providers of travel and lodging.

<P><B>Background</B>
<P>As Basin air quality continues to improve, high ozone concentrations occur less frequently and in limited, localized areas.  Similarly, exposures to high ozone concentrations occur over smaller areas.  These trends may make it more cost-effective to plan and implement local concentration reduction strategies in well-characterized high ozone exposure receptor areas rather than implementing more stringent region-wide emission control programs for stationary and mobile sources.
<P>One ozone control strategy which has been proposed is the &quot;Cool Communities&quot; concept.  Typically, urban areas have darker surfaces and less vegetation than rural areas.  This results in urban summer temperatures which are, on average, 5<SUP>o</SUP>F higher than surrounding rural areas.  The 1997 draft AQMP includes control measure MSC-01, &quot;Promotion of Lighter Color Roofing and Road Materials Programs,&quot; which addresses this &quot;heat island&quot; effect by encouraging activities such as use of lighter color and more reflective surface materials for roofing and road pavement, and increased tree plantings to lower ambient temperatures in urban areas.  In this approach, which has been promoted by the U.S. Department of Energy for several years, lowered urban ambient temperatures would reduce photochemical reactions and subsequent ozone formation.  In addition, demand for electricity for cooling purposes would be reduced, in turn decreasing formation of NOx, a precursor to ozone.  The environmental impact of implementing lighter color, more reflective surface coatings can be minimized with the use of low- and zero-VOC coatings complying with AQMD Rule 1113, while the impact of increased tree plantings can be limited with the planting of low- and zero-VOC emitting trees.
<P><B>Proposal</B>
<P>The implementation of the &quot;Cool Communities&quot; strategy could result in cost-effective ozone concentration reductions.  However, the magnitude of control cannot be estimated without a rigorous modeling assessment to evaluate feasibility.  In this project, air quality modeling and evaluation will be conducted to determine the ozone concentration reduction, equivalent emission reduction potential, and cost-effectiveness of the &quot;Cool Communities&quot; concept.  A sensitivity or uncertainty analysis also will be conducted in conjunction with the air quality modeling effort.
<P>In support of this effort, a working group has been established consisting of modeling experts from the AQMD, other government agencies, research, and private industry.  The working group will provide input to the modeling effort and will assist with project oversight.  If the modeling results are promising, this project could serve as the basis for a scaled-up demonstration of several ozone control strategies in a local area with relatively high ozone concentrations.  Ultimately, consistent with draft 1997 AQMP control measure MSC-01, these preliminary studies could serve as the basis for an AQMD program to promote the use of light colored roofing and pavement and increased tree planting.
<P>On September 13, 1996, RFP #9697-12 was released.  It was listed in the following publications:
<P><I>Los Angeles Times, Orange County Register, San Bernardino Sun, Riverside Press </I><I>Enterprise, La Opinion, Korea Central Daily, Rafu Shimpo, Philippine News, L.A. </I><I>Sentinel, Eastern Group Publication, Inland Valley Daily Bulletin (SB area), Inland </I><I>Empire Hispanic News, Precinct Reporter, El Chicano, The Black Voice News, La Voz, </I><I>The Excelsior, Chinese News, M/W/DVBE Source.</I>
<P>The RFP was also posted on the AQMD&#146;s Internet web site.  None of the technically qualified proposers were eligible for additional points due to M/W/DVBE and therefore there is no potential violation of proposition 209.  A total of four proposals were received by the October 15, 1996 closing date.  They were reviewed and evaluated according to established AQMD guidelines by a panel comprised of AQMD staff and members of the above-described working group.  The six member panel consisted of five males and one female; four Caucasians and 2 Asians.  A summary of the panel&#146;s scoring is included as Attachment A.  The evaluation process involved two steps.  First, proposals were evaluated using technical criteria.  Proposals receiving scores of at least 70 out of 100 points were considered technically qualified and eligible for contract award.  Based on the technical criteria, one proposal received an averaged score of less than 70 points and was eliminated from further consideration.  Next, the technically qualified proposals were evaluated using the criteria of &quot;cost and other factors,&quot; as outlined in the RFP.  Using this two-step selection process, the proposal from Environ International Corporation received the highest overall score.

<P><hr>
<P><B>Background</B>
<P>Ozone concentrations in the South Coast Air Basin have decreased significantly over the past twenty years.  Peak ozone concentrations have dropped from 45 pphm in 1979 to 26 pphm in 1995.  During this period, the number of Stage I ozone episode days has gone down from 120 to 14.  However, the Basin still experiences the worst ozone air quality in the nation.  As air quality continues to improve in the Basin, high ozone concentrations occur less frequently and in limited, localized areas.  Similarly, exposure to high ozone concentrations occur over smaller areas.  These trends may make it more cost-effective to plan and implement local concentration reduction strategies in well-characterized high ozone exposure receptor areas rather than implementing more stringent region-wide emission control programs for stationary and mobile sources.
<P>One ozone control strategy which has been proposed is the use of air conditioning-bound catalysts for ozone scrubbing.  Engelhard Corporation has developed the PremAir catalyst, which is capable of removing ozone directly from ambient air.  With PremAir, a catalytic powder is coated onto a surface, such as a heat exchanger, that comes into contact with large volumes of ambient air.  During testing on vehicle radiators in summer 1995, 80 percent scrubbing of ozone was achieved with no catalyst deterioration over 10,000 miles.  Similar conversion efficiencies and deterioration rates have been observed with stationary air conditioning (AC) units.
<P>The draft 1997 AQMP includes control measure MSC-03, &quot;Promotion of Catalyst-Surface Coating Technology Programs,&quot; which seeks to encourage the incorporation of catalyst-surface coating technologies in residential and commercial air conditioning units as an ozone control strategy.
<P><B>Proposal</B>
<P>The implementation of air conditioning-bound catalysts for ozone scrubbing could result in cost-effective ozone concentration reductions.  However, the magnitude of control cannot be estimated without a rigorous modeling assessment to evaluate feasibility.  In this project, air quality modeling and evaluation will be conducted to determine the ozone concentration reduction, equivalent emission reduction potential, and cost-effectiveness of the ozone scrubbing catalyst.  A sensitivity or uncertainty analysis will also be conducted in conjunction with the air quality modeling effort.
<P>In support of this effort, a working group has been established consisting of modeling experts from the AQMD, other government agencies, research entities, and private industry.  The working group will provide input to the modeling effort and will assist with project oversight.  If the modeling results are promising, this project could serve as the basis for a scaled-up demonstration of several ozone control strategies in a local area with relatively high ozone concentrations.  Ultimately, consistent with draft 1997 AQMP control measure MSC-03, these preliminary studies could serve as the basis for an AQMD program to promote the use of catalyst-surface coating technologies in residential and commercial air conditioning units.
<P>On September 3, 1996, RFP #9697-10 was released.  It was listed in the following publications:
<P><I>Los Angeles Times, Orange County Register, San Bernardino Sun, Riverside Press </I><I>Enterprise, La Opinion, Korea Central Daily, Rafu Shimpo, Philippine News, L.A. </I><I>Sentinel, Eastern Group Publication, Inland Valley Daily Bulletin (SB area), Inland </I><I>Empire Hispanic News, Precinct Reporter, El Chicano, The Black Voice News, La Voz, </I><I>The Excelsior, Chinese News, M/W/DVBE Source.</I>
<P>The RFP was also posted on the AQMD&#146;s Internet web site.  Two proposals were received by the October 3, 1996 closing date:  one from Environ International Corporation (Environ) and one from ICF Kaiser Consulting Group, Systems Applications International, Inc. (SAI).  They were reviewed and evaluated according to established AQMD guidelines by a panel comprised of AQMD staff and members of the above-described working group.  The eight-member panel consisted of seven males and one female, six Caucasians and two Asians.
<P>A summary of the panel&#146;s scoring is included as Attachment A.  On the basis of technical criteria alone, the panel&#146;s averaged scores favored SAI (87.75) over Environ (79.50), with six of the eight panelists awarding higher scores to SAI.  When the criteria of &quot;cost and other factors&quot; were accounted for, Environ&#146;s total score was higher than SAI&#146;s (74.75 versus 71.88), solely on the basis of Environ&#146;s lower bid cost ($44,739 versus $49,457).
<P>Even though Environ received a higher overall rating, AQMD staff recommends that SAI receive a contract award for this project.  Section VI. D. of the RFP specifies that &quot;the Governing Board may award the contract to a proposer other than the proposer receiving the highest rating in the event the Governing Board determines that another proposer from among those technically qualified would provide the best value to District considering cost and technical factors.  The determination shall be based solely on the Evaluation Criteria contained in the RFP, on evidence provided in the proposal and on any other evidence provided during the bid review process.  Evidence provided during the bid review process is limited to clarification by the proposer of information presented in his/her proposal.&quot;
<P>Staff believes that the proposal from SAI would provide the best value to the AQMD because:  (1) it addresses ozone changes based on microscale effects in an innovative way; the technical approach proposed by Environ is not particularly innovative and could be performed in-house by AQMD staff, and there is some concern whether Environ&#146;s approach would properly capture the microscale effects of air conditioning-bound catalysts; (2) the evaluation panel rated SAI higher than Environ on the technical portions of the proposal; and (3) the cost difference between the two proposals is less than 10 percent.  Staff believes that selection of SAI over Environ is justified.

<P><b>Proposal:</b>

<blockquote>Execute Contract with CARB to Cost-Share Heavy-Duty Vehicle 
Fleet Characterization for Reduction of NOx and Particulate Matter Emissions in the South Coast Air Basin
</blockquote>

<P><b>Synopsis:</b>

<blockquote>The objective of this project is to obtain detailed activity and usage data for heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) operating in the Basin to enable the design of incentive programs to increase the percentage of HDVs with low-emitting engines.  The incentive programs supported by the CARB will assist the AQMD&#146;s efforts to attain ambient air quality standards for ozone and particulates in the South Coast Air Basin.  AQMD funding for this $200,000 project shall not exceed $100,000.  The remaining balance will be funded by the CARB.

<P><b>Committee:</b>

<blockquote>Technology, November 15, 1996, Recommended for Approval</blockquote><P><b>Recommended Action:</b>
<blockquote>Authorize the Chairman to execute an agreement with the CARB in an amount not to exceed $100,000 to conduct heavy-duty fleet characterization and design of incentive programs for reduction of HDV NOx and particulate matter emissions in the South Coast Air Basin.
</blockquote>

<BR> Executive Officer
<P><hr>
<P><B>Background</B>
<P>Heavy-duty vehicles contribute significantly to the South Coast Air Basin's mobile source emissions inventories for NOx and PM.  Emissions reduction measures for NOx, VOC, and PM from HDVs have been specified in the SIP.
<P>Knowledge of the specific makeup of the South Coast Air Basin's HDV fleet will assist the regulatory agencies in designing appropriate implementation programs for these control measures.  For instance, if there are large numbers of HDVs in fleets that do not leave the Basin, then alternatively fueled HDVs could be a viable option; or if a large proportion of HDVs consist of older, high-emitting vehicles, then a buyback, retrofit, or rebuild program might be effective.
<P>The proposed action is to jointly fund a project with CARB to obtain detailed activity and usage data for HDV operations in the South Coast Air Basin.  The scope of work is comprised of three main parts:  1) a detailed characterization of the HDV fleet in the South Coast Air Basin, including vehicle population, usage patterns, maintenance practices, and retrofit or repower options; 2) the development of an emissions estimate in the South Coast Air Basin for each of the years 1997 through 2010 and the year 2020; and 3) the development of an incentive/implementation strategy to accelerate the introduction of low-emitting heavy-duty engines, and an estimation of emissions benefits derived from each specified alternative.
<P>The proposed project is included in the Technology Advancement Plan, approved on October 11, 1996, as Project T1-2, &quot;Heavy-Duty Characterization for Reduction of NOx and Particulate Matter Emissions.&quot;  The expected benefit of this project would be the potential acceleration of the introduction of low-emitting heavy-duty engines by the use of clean burning fuels.  Specifically, targeting specific duty cycles of HDVs can identify suitable applications for clean fuels usage by those sources indicated as large contributors to the emissions inventory.
<P><B>Sole Source Justification</B>
<P>Section II, Step 3(C) of the Consultant Selection Policy identifies four provisions under which the Governing Board may award a sole-source contract:  (1) cost to prepare documents exceeds the cost for consultant; (2) delay would result in the endangerment of public health; (3) services are only available from the sole source; and (4) other circumstances exist identifying the sole source as in the best interest of the AQMD.  This request for sole source award is being made under provision (4).  
<P>CARB will be the primary contractor and will be responsible for overall management of this project.  The CARB has regulatory authority to establish and implement emissions standards for on-road engines.  In this capacity, the CARB is well acquainted with the industry and issues related to incentive programs and regulatory development.  As a lead agency for developing on-road equipment and engine regulations, the CARB is well positioned to oversee the characterization of HDV fleets and development of incentive programs for enhancement of low-emitting engines.  This ability is critical to the successful execution of this project.  In addition, the CARB has had extensive experience in managing and administering projects involving on-road engines.
<P>It is important that this project be funded as an effective incentives program could shape future regulations which, in turn, would provide a direct emissions benefit in the Basin.  By providing co-funding for this project, the AQMD will participate in all administrative and technical aspects including review of the proposals and selection of a contractor to complete work specified under the contract, and will meet regularly with CARB staff and representatives from other contractors involved with this project.
<P>California State law (Public Contract Code, Section 10115 et seq. and Title 2, California Code of Regulations, Section 1896.60 et seq.) requires that &quot;goals of participation&quot; involving Minority, Women, and Disabled Veteran Business Enterprises be met for each contract entered into by and between the State and outside contractor(s).  The minimum percentages of participation that must be obtained for this contract are:  Minority Business Enterprises (15%), Women-Owned Business Enterprises (5%), and Disabled Veteran Business Enterprises (3%).  Bidders that will be considered responsive to this requirement are those that either attain the entire participation goal percentages, or provide sufficient documentation to demonstrate that a sincere good-faith effort was made to attain the goals.
<P><B>Resource Impacts</B>
<P>The total cost of the project is $200,000, with AQMD's co-sponsorship amount not to exceed $100,000.  The CARB intends to provide the $100,000 balance of funding for this project.  Sufficient funds are available in the FY 1996-97 budget to fund this project.

<P><B>Background</B>
<P>Off-road equipment powered by gasoline and LPG engines of 25 to less than 175 horsepower contribute significantly to the South Coast Air Basin's mobile source emissions inventory.  There are currently no emissions standards and control requirements for these engines.  In the absence of controls, the relative contribution of reactive organic gas (ROG) emissions from these engines to the Basin's emissions inventory will continue to increase.
<P>The mobile source element of the 1994 SIP includes future control measures M11 and M12 for reduction of exhaust emissions from off-road equipment powered by gasoline and LPG engines of 25 to 175 horsepower.  However, these two control measures do not include evaporative emissions.  Moreover, there are currently no data available to quantify actual evaporative emissions from these engines.  The available data from on-road gasoline vehicles are not applicable as they have evaporative control systems as well as a different test cycle.  Therefore, it is necessary to quantify the actual evaporative emissions from these engines in order to develop and implement cost effective control strategies.
<P><B>Proposal</B>
<P>This RFP solicits proposals for measurement of evaporative emissions from off-road equipment with gasoline and LPG engines of 25 to less than 175 horsepower.  It focuses on the development of a representative testing cycle and quantification of evaporative emissions as running and resting losses, together with gasoline refueling or LPG transfer losses.  This quantification is to be used to estimate emission reduction benefits of suggested available control strategies, with evaluation of factors such as cost, durability, equipment compatibility, fuel usage effects, performance characteristics, etc.
<P>Proposals received will be evaluated by a panel selected according to the criteria spelled out in the attached RFP #9697-24.  Due to the particular importance of technical qualifications in awarding advanced technology contracts, staff has proposed in the RFP to weight a significant portion of the cost component of the scoring by technical strength, in effect a form of cost-effectiveness.  This form of scoring differs from the general practice of using total costs as the sole criterion, which the Board&#146;s Consultant Selection Policy may be interpreted to call for.  This change was brought to the attention of the Technology Committee, which approved this revision.
<P>The proposed project is included in the Technology Advancement Plan, approved on October 11, 1996, as Project T1-1, &quot;Quantification of Evaporative Emissions from Off-Road Mobile Sources between 25 hp to 175 hp.&quot;  The major benefit of this project is the improvement of the VOC inventory in the Basin, which will in turn assist in the evaluation of evaporative emission changes due to future conversion of existing gasoline engines to clean fuels.  In addition, this project will assist the AQMD in the evaluation of the evaporative emissions contribution of existing off-road LPG engines.
<P>Staff will develop a public announcement advertising the RFP on local radio stations and will advertise this RFP in the following publications:
<P><I>The Black Voice News, Chinese News, Eastern Group Publication, El Chicano, The </I><I>Excelsior, Inland Empire Hispanic News, Inland Valley Daily Bulletin (SB area), </I><I>Korean Central Daily, L.A. Sentinel, La Opinion, La Voz, Los Angeles Times, </I><I>M/W/DBE Source, Orange County Register, Philippine News, Precinct Reporter, Rafu </I><I>Shimpo, Riverside Press Enterprise, and The San Bernardino Sun.</I>
<P>Copies of the RFP will be sent to the Black and Latino Legislative Caucuses and interested minority contractors/professional associations and vendors listed in the Los Angeles County, MTA, Cal Trans, and Inland Area MBE/WBE directories.  Further, the RFPs will be placed on the AQMD&#146;s internet and bidders&#146;s 24-hour telephone message line.
<P><B>Resource Impacts</B>
<P>Total cost for the proposed RFP is estimated to be $150,000.  Sufficient funds are available in the FY 1996-1997 Budget.

<BR>Executive Officer
<P><hr>
<P><B>Background</B>
<P>In 1990, the ARB adopted a requirement that large vehicle manufacturers with annual California vehicle sales greater than 35,000 units must offer for sale a specified percentage of ZEVs.  As a result, Chrysler, Ford, GM, Honda, Mazda, Nissan, and Toyota were required to produce passenger car and/or light-duty truck ZEVs starting with 1998 models.  For the near term, these ZEVs are expected to be battery-powered EVs.  In March 1996, the ARB modified the ZEV requirements to incorporate a market-based approach which will advance the introduction of cleaner vehicles into the marketplace and allow time for further development of longer-range batteries and EV infrastructure.  Mandatory requirements to produce and offer ZEVs for sale will go into effect in 2003 when all large and intermediate-size vehicle manufacturers must each offer 10 percent ZEVs for California sales.  Between 1996 and 2000, the seven largest vehicle manufacturers have agreed to put on the market a total of 3,750 EVs with advanced batteries.  GM and Ford have announced the market introduction of their EVs.  These vehicles&#146; performance will be equivalent to gasoline vehicles in all respects except for travel range, which will be limited to 50 to 90 miles.  This range is a result of the limited energy capacity of lead-acid batteries.  GM, Honda, and Toyota have also announced that they will introduce EVs with advanced nickel-metal-hydride batteries next year, which will enable EVs to travel from 130 to 150 miles.
<P>There are active efforts to increase the range and energy storage capacity of EVs.  The United States Advanced Battery Consortium (USABC) is supporting the development of several new batteries made of high-energy materials such as nickel and lithium.  The Advanced Lead-Acid Battery Consortium (ALABC) and others are also developing improved batteries made of more traditional materials such as lead and zinc.
<P>The travel range of a vehicle is a combination of many factors, including energy storage capacity and refueling or recharging time.  With large fuel tanks and relatively short refueling times, traditional vehicles have essentially unlimited daily range.  However, EVs have relatively small &quot;fuel tanks&quot; (battery energy storage capacity) and relatively long &quot;refueling&quot; (recharging) times of between three and twelve hours for empty battery packs.  This essentially limits the daily range to the capacity of the battery pack with an overnight charge.  Charging between short trips or &quot;opportunity charging&quot; can potentially double an EV&#146;s daily range.
<P>Fast, high-power charging systems are now being developed, or are under consideration for development, with the goal of recharging EVs in minutes rather than hours.  These charging systems include those using conductive (metal-to-metal) and inductive (magnetic) coupling between the EV and the off-board charging station.  Besides high electrical power, some of these systems use proprietary charging patterns or algorithms which speed charging and improve battery life.
<P><B>Proposal</B>
<P>An RFP is proposed to solicit cost-shared projects for the development and demonstration of fast charging systems for EVs.  This solicitation is for technologies for which proof&#146;s-of-concept have been demonstrated, not for basic research.  These proposed systems should meet the Level 3 charging specifications as defined by the Electric Power Research Institute.  Specifically, a qualifying charging system should be able to return 50 percent of the battery pack capacity within 10 minutes, generally greater than 50 kilowatts in power.  Expected proposals will include charging-equipment development for specified battery technology, and an EV demonstration, preferably using original-equipment manufacturer (OEM) EVs.  Impacts of the fast charging system on battery technology, other than that which is specified in the proposal, will be addressed.  The proposed systems may include energy storage at the charging station as an option.
<P>Staff will develop a public announcement advertising the RFP on local radio stations and will advertise this RFP in the following publications:
<P><I>The Black Voice News, Chinese News, Eastern Group Publication, El Chicano, The </I><I>Excelsior, Inland Empire Hispanic News, Inland Valley Daily Bulletin (SB area), </I><I>Korean Central Daily, L.A. Sentinel, La Opinion, La Voz, Los Angeles Times, </I><I>M/W/DBE Source, Orange County Register, Philippine News, Precinct Reporter, Rafu </I><I>Shimpo, Riverside Press Enterprise, and The San Bernardino Sun.</I>
<P>Copies of the RFP will be sent to the Black and Latino Legislative Caucuses and interested minority contractors/professional associations and vendors listed in the Los Angeles County, MTA, Cal Trans, and Inland Area MBE/WBE directories.  Further, the RFPs will be placed on the AQMD&#146;s internet and bidders&#146;s 24-hour telephone message line.  To avoid a potential violation of Proposition 209, preference points for minority- or woman-owned business enterprises (MBE/WBE) may not be given.  Proposition 209 does not affect disabled veteran business enterprises (DVBE).
<P>Due to the particular importance of technical qualifications in awarding advanced technology contracts, staff has proposed in the RFP to weight a significant portion of the cost component of the scoring by technical strength, in effect a form of cost effectiveness.  This form of scoring differs from the general practice of using total costs as the sole criterion, which the Board&#146;s Consultant Selection Policy may be interpreted to call for.  This change was brought to the attention of the Technology Committee, which approved this revision.
<P><B>Resource Impacts</B>
<P>Multiple project awards are expected.  The total cost to the AQMD will not exceed $1 million, with no individual award exceeding $500,000.  The total aggregate, shared cost of these projects is expected to exceed $3 million.  There is sufficient funding in the FY 1996-97 budget to fund these projects.

</blockquote>

<P><b>Committee:</b>

<blockquote>Technology, November 15, 1996, Recommended for Approval</blockquote><P><b>Recommended Action:</b>
<blockquote>Issue RFP #9697-22 to study advanced batteries in electric vehicles, for an amount not to exceed $480,000.</blockquote>
<P>James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<BR>Executive Officer
<P><hr>
<P><B>Background</B>
<P>In 1990, the ARB adopted a regulation requiring the seven largest vehicle manufacturers to introduce a specified percentage of light-duty passenger cars and trucks as zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) beginning in 1998.  In March 1996, the ARB modified the ZEV regulation to incorporate a market-based approach which will advance the introduction of cleaner vehicles into the market place and allow additional time for development of longer-range batteries and EV infrastructure.  Remaining in place is a requirement for large and intermediate vehicle manufacturers to produce and offer for sale ten percent of their light-duty fleets as ZEVs for the 2003 model year.
<P>The ARB has also entered into a Technology Development Partnership consisting of a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with each of the seven largest auto manufacturers for demonstration of advanced battery ZEVs in the near term.  As a result of these MOAs, between 1,250 and 3,750 advanced battery ZEVs will be demonstrated in California through the year 2000.  Three major manufacturers have announced plans to demonstrate advanced-battery ZEVs as early as spring 1997, many of which will be placed in Southern California.
<P>The purpose of the Technology Development Partnership is to promote the development and demonstration of advanced battery technologies in real-world applications.  Vehicle manufacturers have agreed to report information to ARB regarding ZEVs demonstrated in California, including major battery specifications, as well as allow ARB on-site review of activities related to their ZEV programs.  The MOAs do not, however, require vehicle manufacturers to report specific information related to performance or customer use of these MOA ZEVs.  An important implicit element of the Technology Development Partnership is to provide a mechanism for the ARB, the AQMD, and other ZEV stakeholders to evaluate not only the performance, reliability, safety, and life-cycle of advanced batteries in ZEVs, but other factors including infrastructure, market acceptance, and lifetime costs.  Ongoing evaluation of each of these factors is essential for the future implementation of the ZEV program, as well as the AQMD&#146;s ZEV technology assessments.
<P>Because of these issues, a working group composed of staff from the ARB, Southern California Edison, California Energy Commission and the AQMD was assembled, and this group formulated the proposed RFP to study advanced EV batteries.
<P><B>Proposal</B>
<P>An RFP is proposed to solicit the demonstration and study of advanced batteries for EVs.  Five basic study tasks are proposed:
<P> Task 1 - Vehicle Performance and Utility
<br> Task 2 - Customer Acceptance
<br> Task 3 - Operating and Ownership Costs
<br> Task 4 - Charging Systems Impacts and Infrastructure Assessment
<br> Task 5 - Lead-Acid Battery EV Comparisons
<P>The contractor shall work with EV manufacturers, distributors and utilities to coordinate information gathering and accomplish these tasks.  The purpose of Task 1 is to evaluate driving patterns, energy usage and charging patterns of EVs as influenced by the advanced battery.  Task 2 studies customer impressions and satisfaction compared to similar gasoline vehicles.  Task 3 deals with operating and ownership costs including energy, charging equipment, maintenance, and repair.  Task 4 assesses the impact of advanced batteries on the charging system and utility infrastructure.  Finally, Task 5 determines the extent to which advanced batteries provide additional customer value over lead-acid batteries.  The final report for this study will present the findings in a manufacturer-neutral format.
<P>Staff will develop a public announcement advertising the RFP on local radio stations and will advertise this RFP in the following publications:
<P><I>The Black Voice News, Chinese News, Eastern Group Publication, El Chicano, The </I><I>Excelsior, Inland Empire Hispanic News, Inland Valley Daily Bulletin (SB area), </I><I>Korean Central Daily, L.A. Sentinel, La Opinion, La Voz, Los Angeles Times, </I><I>M/W/DBE Source, Orange County Register, Philippine News, Precinct Reporter, Rafu </I><I>Shimpo, Riverside Press Enterprise, and The San Bernardino Sun.</I>
<P>Copies of the RFP will be sent to the Black and Latino Legislative Caucuses and interested minority contractors/professional associations and vendors listed in the Los Angeles County, MTA, Cal Trans, and Inland Area MBE/WBE directories.  Further, the RFPs will be placed on the AQMD&#146;s Internet and bidders&#146;s 24-hour telephone message line.  To avoid a potential violation of Proposition 209, preference points for minority- or woman-owned business enterprises (MBE/WBE) may not be given.  Proposition 209 does not affect disabled veteran business enterprises.
<P>Due to the particular importance of technical qualifications in awarding advanced technology contracts, staff has proposed in the RFP to weight a significant portion of the cost component of the scoring by technical strength, in effect a form of cost effectiveness.  This form of scoring differs from the general practice of using total costs as the sole criterion, which the Board&#146;s Consultant Selection Policy may be interpreted to call for.  This change was brought to the attention of the Technology Committee, which approved this revision.
<P><B>Resource Impacts</B>
<P>The total cost of this project will not exceed $480,000.  AQMD funding will not exceed $240,000.  The ARB has committed $240,000 to cosponsor this project.  Electric utilities such as SCE and Los Angeles Department of Water and Power may join this study prior to contract initiation and contribute resources.  There is sufficient funding in the FY 1996-97 Budget to fund this project.

<P><B>Background</B>
<P>In October of 1993, the AQMD adopted a regulatory program called REgional CLean Air Incentives Market (RECLAIM).  RECLAIM is a market incentive program designed to allow facilities flexibility in achieving emission reduction requirements for oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and oxides of sulfur (SOx).  Each facility in the RECLAIM program is given a starting annual emissions allocation. The amount of this emissions allocation declines each year.  Facilities can buy and sell emissions allocations in the form of RECLAIM Trading Credits (RTC) as a means of adjusting their allocations in order to reconcile with their annual actual emissions.  There are currently about 350 facilities participating in the RECLAIM program.  The existing RTC trading program was developed for registering and tracking RTC trading information, and updating the RTC listings.
<P><B>Proposal</B>
<P>The goal of this procurement is to enhance the existing RTC trading program security, to streamline the RTC trade registration process, and to expand the system to accommodate the proposed future Universal Trading Credit market. These enhancements will increase staff&#146;s productivity and further ensure enforceability of the NOx/SOx RECLAIM Program.
<P>District's Consultant Selection Policy and Procedure.  The contract award will not exceed $15,000.  Funding is included in the FY 1996-97 Budget.

<P><B>Committee:</B><blockquote>Administrative, November 22, 1996, Recommended for Approval</blockquote>
<P><B>Recommended Action:</B>
<blockquote>Approve the issuance of RFP #9697-19 to enhance the electronic permit application filing system  at a cost not to exceed $85,000.</blockquote>
<P>James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<BR>Executive Officer
<P><hr>
<P><B>Background</B>
<P>One of the Governing Board&#146;s regulatory reform initiatives was to establish the capability of filing permit applications electronically over the Internet to make application filing easier and more interactive for the applicants.  A pilot system - Web-Actuated Request for Permits (WARP) - was developed and implemented in November 1996.  The pilot system allows participating facilities to file permit applications using a secure link on the Internet and to get information regarding the status/progress of their electronic application.  The applicant accesses AQMD&#146;s Web page and goes to the WARP screen.  There, the applicant is guided through the process of filling out the permit application form with Help screens available at every level.  Once the application information is completed by the applicant, the system calculates the applicable fees and gives the applicant a transaction number for each application entered.  The applicant can then print a copy of the application form locally to submit with the fee payment.
<P>The WARP pilot system presently is limited to applications for four equipment types:  internal combustion engines, boilers and liquid heaters, negative air machines, and fuel storage and dispensing equipment, from facilities with total emissions less than 4 tons per year that are not in the RECLAIM program.  With the successful implementation of the pilot program, it is appropriate to undertake the first phase of enhancements to the system to add features recommended by users (both AQMD staff and participating facilities) and to expand the system to include additional equipment types and more facilities.  A phased approach to WARP enhancements will allow AQMD to incorporate additional requirements and other modifications identified as the use of WARP grows.
<P><B>Proposal</B>
<P>Issue an RFP  to identify a contractor for the first phase of WARP enhancements.  In accordance with the AQMD&#146;s Consulting and Contracting Policy, a public notice inviting bids will be published in the following publications:  <I>California State Contracts Register, Chinese Daily </I><I>News, Eastern Group Publications, El Chicano, Inland Valley Daily Bulletin, Inland Empire </I><I>Hispanic News, Korean Central Daily, La Opinion, La Voz, Los Angeles Sentinel, Los </I><I>Angeles Times, M/W/DVBE Source, Orange County Register, Philippine News, Precinct </I><I>Reporter, Rafu Shimpo, Riverside Press Enterprise, San Bernardino Sun, The Black Voice </I><I>News, and The Excelsior</I>.  
<P>Additionally, potential bidders will be identified through Los Angeles County&#146;s Directory of Certified Minority, Women, Disadvantaged and Disabled Veterans Business Enterprises; the Directory of Certified Firms published by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority; The Inland Area Opportunity Pages Ethnic/Women Business &amp; Professional Directory; the Caltrans electronic bulletin board listing of Disadvantaged and Women Business Enterprises; the AQMD&#146;s own electronic listing of certified minority vendors; and the Purchasing mailing list.  Copies of the RFP also will be mailed to the Black Caucus, Latino Caucus, and various minority chamber of commerce and business associations, and public service announcements will be sent out to local radio, TV and cable stations.

<BR>Executive Officer
<P><hr>
<A NAME="E33E15"></A>
<P><B>Background</B></H1>
<P>On January 12, 1996, the Board adopted the Regulatory Reform Initiatives, a five-point program to shrink the agency's size by 50% during the next decade, eliminate permits for the smallest sources and further streamline air pollution permitting.  The key to making this initiative possible is through automation of agency activities.
<P>New and emerging information technologies like <I>workflow automation</I> permit organizations to reengineer organizational tasks to facilitate and improve operational and management activities by managing information across the entire agency.  Providing timely, accurate, and complete information to all workers opens the way to significant productivity improvements.
<P>Workflow automation generally involves the replacement of manual paperwork processing by computer-to-computer transmission of business documents (such as electronic forms, document images, or files created by word processors, spreadsheets, or other software applications).  Originally conceived as a means to help minimize paperwork and thereby reduce data-entry staff requirements and data-input errors, workflow automation also helps to streamline fundamental business practices.  Workflow automation does much more than simply place documents on someone's computer desktop -- documents can be automatically dispatched along pre-defined routes, tracked and located at any point in the progression, modified or edited, or electronically approved.  Workflow automation combines the electronic processing of paperwork (timecards, purchase orders, invoices, bills, or other business documents) with direct transfer of the documents from one work group's computers to those of another. 
<P><B>Proposal</B>
<P>A number of AQMD functions lend themselves to workflow automation, involving multiple levels of approval and critical data that cut across organizational lines.  Candidate functions include timecards, purchase requisitions, and the IM service request forms (hardware/software purchase requisitions, login requests, Internet address requests).
<P>The attached RFP solicits bids for designing and developing workflow systems for the following functions:  timecards, purchase requisitions, and IM service request forms.  Although the AQMD has a staff of computer specialists, systems analysts, and programmers to provide computer support services to AQMD components, IM does not maintain the specialized resources in-house to develop a comprehensive overall workflow automation system.
<P>In accordance with the AQMD&#146;s Consulting and Contracting Policy, a public notice inviting bids will be published in the following publications:
<P> <I>California State Contracts Register, Chinese Daily News, Eastern Group Publications, El </I><I>Chicano, Inland Valley Daily Bulletin, Inland Empire Hispanic News, Korean Central </I><I>Daily, La Opinion, La Voz, Los Angeles Sentinel, Los Angeles Times, M/W/DVBE </I><I>Source, Orange County Register, Philippine News, Precinct Reporter, Rafu Shimpo, </I><I>Riverside Press Enterprise, San Bernardino Sun, The Black Voice News, and The </I><I>Excelsior</I>. 
<P>Additionally, potential bidders will be identified through Los Angeles County&#146;s Directory of Certified Minority, Women, Disadvantaged and Disabled Veterans Business Enterprises; the Directory of Certified Firms published by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority; The Inland Area Opportunity Pages Ethnic/Women Business &amp; Professional Directory; the Caltrans electronic bulletin board listing of Disadvantaged and Women Business Enterprises; the AQMD&#146;s own electronic listing of certified minority vendors; and the Purchasing mailing list.  
<P>Copies of the RFP also will be mailed to the Black Caucus, Latino Caucus, and various minority chamber of commerce and business associations, and public service announcements will be sent out to local radio, TV and cable stations.  The RFP also will be posted on the Internet.  Further personal outreach efforts by staff will be made to various minority businesses and chambers of commerce to inform and invite prospective bidders to visit the Diamond Bar facility and to submit proposals.
<P>To avoid a potential violation of Proposition 209, preference points for minority- or woman-owned business en terprise (M/WBE) may not be given.  Proposition 209 does not affect disabled veteran business enterprises (DVBE).
<P><B>Resource Impacts</B>
<P>Funds for these services in the amount of $150,000 are included in the approved FY 1996-97 Budget.

<P><B><U>SECTION I - PUBLIC ADVISOR ACTIVITIES</U></B>
<P>Staff participated in the activities, programs and events listed below.  A statistical report of these activities also is included.
<P>Contact: La Ronda V. Bowen, Public Advisor, 909.396.3235
<P><B>BUSINESS OUTREACH</B>
<P>OUTREACH FOR NEWLY-ADOPTED RULE 1171 - SOLVENT CLEANING OPERATIONS - AQMD staff, in conjunction with Stationary Source Compliance staff, met with representatives of various wastewater treatment facilities and regional water quality agencies to begin development of a unified outreach program to notify auto repair facilities of the requirement to switch to water-based solvent for their parts-cleaning operations.  AQMD committed to spearhead this joint outreach program when the rule was adopted in order to alleviate concerns by water agencies that this air-pollution reduction measure might contribute to water quality problems if the dirty solvent is poured down the sewer rather than properly disposed of as hazardous waste.
<P>AQMP PUBLIC CONSULTATION MEETING - At the request of Assemblywoman Grace Napolitano, AQMD conducted a public consultation meeting in Norwalk to discuss the Air Quality Management Plan with local businesses and residents.  AQMD staff conducted an extensive outreach campaign including advertisements in the newspapers, public service announcements sent to radio and TV stations,  and direct mail notification of nearly 2,500 businesses and interested parties within the cities of the 58th Assembly District.
<P>PUBLIC NOTIFICATION - AQMD is increasing the scope of its notification to businesses on new and amended rules.  The District will procure mailing lists of all potentially interested businesses.  Historically, such notification has been done for the initial rule workshop and subsequent mailings have gone only to those who expressed interest.  It is hoped that this increased outreach will result in greater participation in rule development activities.
<P><B>COMMUNITY OUTREACH</B>
<P>VISITING DIGNITARIES - AQMD staff coordinated the visits of four foreign delegations during the month of October.  They were as follows: 
<P>FRIDAY, OCTOBER 4, 1996 (Thailand) - A 12-member delegation of researchers and policy makers from Bangkok, hosted by the World Environment Center, visited with Stationary Source Compliance staff for an overview of RECLAIM and Applied Science and Technology staff for a tour of the chemistry lab.
<P>MONDAY; OCTOBER 7, 1996 (France);  A 75-member delegation of Transcet, the Paris transportation planning agency, met with Transportation Programs Director Catherine Wasikowski on alternatives to work trip reduction plans; 
<P>THURSDAY, OCTOBER 10, 1996 (Brazil) - Francesco Palombo of Petrobras, the state-run Brazilian oil company, met with Stationary Source Compliance staff on refinery and energy issues and; 
<P>THURSDAY, OCTOBER 31, 1996 (Canada) - Twelve members of Parliament&#146;s Senate Committee on Energy, The Environment and Natural Resources met with Executive Officer James Lents and members of Technology Advancement, Planning and Stationary Source Compliance staffs for overviews of reformulated fuel policies, the 1997 AQMP and RECLAIM; 
<P>SPEAKERS BUREAU - AQMD&#146;s Speakers Bureau staff coordinated five presentations by AQMD staff to outside organizations.  Presentations were made by staff during the month of October to the following organizations:  ATUA of Los Angeles (Oct. 1); Leadership Manhattan Beach (Oct. 14); Sta-Lube, Inc., of Montebello (Oct. 15);Aire Rite of Huntington Beach (Oct. 17); and Benjamin Franklin Elementary School in Riverside (Oct. 24).
<P>REGULATION VII OUTREACH - On Saturday, October 19, AQMD staff gave a presentation on the changes to Regulation VII - Emergencies - at a regional conference on school-age child care, hosted by the Child Development Department at Long Beach City College. Over 300 school-age child care providers from throughout Southern California attended a dozen breakout sessions. Staff made two presentations at the morning conference.
<P>RIDESHARE FAIRS - Rideshare Month was the month of October.  AQMD staff coordinated AQMD&#146;s participation in 16 rideshare fairs throughout the month of October. AQMD brochures and materials promoting ridesharing, how to reduce air pollution and information on smog and health were provided to employees of companies throughout the basin. Staff was also available to answer questions and provide additional information at nearly ever site. Sites included: Fountain Care Center, Orange; The Walt Disney Company, Anaheim; GTE Services, El Segundo; DWP, Los Angeles; Transamerica Life Companies, Los Angeles; MTI, Anaheim; Maguire Thomas Partners, Los Angeles; Santa Monica Transportation Management Association; Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena; League of California Cities, Anaheim; City of Orange; and ETC Network, Los Angeles.
<P><B>OTHER ISSUES</B>
<P>The entire Public Advisor staff has relocated to make way for the new Clean Technology Center which will showcase products that exceed current air quality requirements and reduce air pollution.  PADV staff are still on the ground floor south building, but just a bit further east from where they were originally.

<P><B><U>SECTION III - SMALL BUSINESS ASSISTANCE ACTIVITIES</U></B>
<P>Highlights of the activities for October, specifically related to the Permit Assistance Centers and the loan guaranty program, are described below.  The statistical report of all staff activities is also included.  Please note that the format for the statistical report has been changed to make it clearer and more reflective of all office activities.
<P>Contact        Lee Lockie, Director, 909.396.2390
<P><B><U>PERMIT ASSISTANCE CENTER HIGHLIGHTS FOR OCTOBER</U></B>
<P>The Small Business Assistance Office (SBAO) staff  met with Stationary Source Compliance (SSC) staff to discuss some of their new procedures for expediting permit processing.  SSC has developed a six-month pilot project which should ease the filing of permits by applicants.  As part of that project, simplified forms are now available to the public through the Internet and are available to internal staff on the q:/drive. Over-the-counter permit service is also available to the public in the lobby of the headquarters building.  This service allows routine permits to construct to be issued to the applicant within approximately 30 to 40 minutes, depending on the completeness of the application.  If the six-month pilot program is successful, SSC plans to convert this counter into a permitting center. This will allow SBAO representatives, who had previously been assisting customers with permit applications at headquarters, to redirect their efforts to Permit Assistance Centers more convenient to certain businesses.
<P><B><U>Gas Company-Energy Resource Center - Downey</U></B>
<P>Staff is continuing to implement the marketing plan for this center.  The initial phase of the plan includes contacting and advising neighboring cities of the assistance available at the center.  
<P>Gas Company account executives have been monitoring responses to the Air Quality Assistance Fund brochure that is currently being provided to Gas Company industrial customers.  
<P>Staff is working on revising and updating the Memorandum of Understanding between the Gas Company and AQMD to reflect the current operating schedule.  
<P>SBAO staff was part of a panel discussion at the Hazardous Waste Expo which was held at the center.  Issues relating to Rule 1166 were discussed.  
<P>SBAO staff is working with the City of Santa Fe Springs by providing permitting assistance to a chemical company that is planning to relocate from Los Angeles to Santa Fe Springs.
<P><B><U>Orange County Permit Assistance Centers - Santa Ana and Lake Forest</U></B>
<P>SBAO staff arranged for a tour of the headquarters building and a briefing on the permit system program for Danian Hopp, Director of the Orange County Permit Assistance Centers.   Staff is developing a similar orientation meeting for the directors of the other permit assistance centers who have requested to learn more about the AQMD&#146;s permitting process and rules and regulations.
<P>Cal-EPA has opened a new one-stop permit assistance center in Lake Forest.  A telephone will be located at the center to provide a toll-free direct-dial line to the Small Business Assistance Office in Diamond Bar.  This phone is for business customers to use when they need assistance with air quality permits.
<P>A display area will also be set up where customers can help themselves to permit applications and other Small Business Assistance outreach material.
<P><B><U>Business Revitalization Center (BRC) - Baldwin Hills</U></B>
<P>Staff will be increasing their time at this center to one full day per week instead of a half day. The BRC has been assigned by the state to oversee all the environmental and permitting work with McDonnell Douglas on the Torrance Redevelopment Project.  The BRC has asked SBAO staff for assistance because of the complex permitting issues involving Rule 1166 (soil decontamination) and toxic hot spots.
<P><B><U>Los Angeles City Hall</U></B>
<P>SBAO is considering staffing this center on Mondays, which is the busiest day of the week at L.A. City Hall.
<P>Staff completed technical audits of 41 gasoline stations for the Charles Company.  This company is in the process of buying and redeveloping all Cal Target Enterprise facilities and needs to determine which equipment requires permits from the AQMD.
<P><B><U>Inland Empire Permit Assistance Center - Ontario</U></B>
<P>The new director, Shereef Aref, comes to this center from his position in management with the Department of Corrections.  Small Business Assistance Office Staff Specialist Sherri Fairbanks is assigned to this office one day per week.  Sherri is working with him to increase community awareness of the center. 
<P>In October a roundtable discussion was held at Chino City Hall to evaluate requirements for expansion of a printing facility.  
<P>Sherri is also conducting cross-training for other center personnel on general air quality permitting issues.
<P><B><U>Coachella Valley Permit Assistance Center - Palm Desert</U></B>
<P>Inquiries are continuing to average approximately two per day at this center. New small business activities remain relatively low.  Three clearance letters were authorized at this center during this reporting period.  The Stationary Source Compliance staff person, assigned to assist SBAO at this office, performed three technical consultations for facilities in the Palm Desert area this month.  This center received one request for a burn permit during this reporting period.
<P><B><U>AIR QUALITY ASSISTANCE FUND</U></B>
<P>During the month of October, the consultant for the Air Quality Assistance Fund (AQAF) Program, Bartik, Cordeiro, and Associates (BCA) completed preliminary screening for funding for six businesses subject to AQMD rules.  These companies represent a wide variety of small and medium-sized businesses including printing, dry-cleaning, autobody, glass manufacturing, and plating.  SBAO staff believes that this recent increased interest in the AQAF results from our newly implemented marketing strategy. Although not all of these companies may ultimately draw from our guaranty fund,  we are in the process of assisting all of them in obtaining alternate financial funding for all of their projects.
<P>SBAO staff, with the assistance of the consultant, have also attempted to vary the scope of financial institutions participating in the program.  Recently they met with loan representatives from Transworld Bank in Woodland Hills, Metro Bank, Southern California Business Development which is an association of local banks, and the California Association of Local Economic Development.  Some of these lenders agreed to finance without the loan guaranty; and, as such, we were able to provide alternate financing sources for customers who did not meet our initial eligibility qualification screening for the program.  
<P>To further diversify our marketing strategies for the program, staff has developed AQAF informational materials packages for inclusion in the curriculum of the existing Certified Permitting Professionals (CPP) college training program.  We expect these outreach efforts to generate increased awareness of the program and new loan guaranty applications.  We hope that this privatization effort will be successful in identifying more businesses in need of financial assistance.
<P><B><U>OTHER ISSUES</U></B>
<P>Staff participated in the Association of Woodworking and Furnishing Suppliers (AWFS) Home and Commercial Fair in Pasadena.  AWFS is the largest furniture and woodworking trade association in the United States.  Approximately 3,000 people attended this event.  The majority of requests that staff received were from businesses that were interested in the District&#146;s position on methylene chloride.
<P>A list of the permit assistance centers, their addresses and phone numbers was printed on page six of the November 1996 edition of the AQMD Advisor.  Approximately 16,046 people are mailed this publication every month.
<P>SBAO will continue to supply Stationary Source Compliance staff with brochures describing our loan guaranty program.  These brochures will be accompanied by a &quot;buckslip&quot; advertising bilingual assistance to applicants.   This assistance will be available in the SBAO office.
<P>The Small Business Assistance Office has been relocated to make room for the Clean Technology Center.  The office is now located directly behind the Clean Technology Center with reception access from the lobby.
<P>Staff is continuing to work with the Cities of Torrance and Compton on developing a program  to support both cities with &quot;one-stop&quot; permit assistance for local businesses in their jurisdictions.

<P> Outreach and meetings with companies      11
<P><B>AMERICAN RACING WHEELS</B>
<P>This company is a manufacturer of aluminum wheels for automotive applications.  They are currently in an expansion mode.  Their concerns centered around the common misconception that being environmentally conscientious would preclude them from a high productivity, high quality manufacturing line.  Staff explained about new, low NOx and high performance combustion equipment that would allow for increased production and high quality parts.  In addition, staff experts discussed production methods that would also increase energy efficiency and decrease material losses known as dross.
<P><B>POMONA ECONOMIC SUMMIT</B>
<P>The second annual Pomona Economic Summit was held in October 24, and was an overwhelming success.  Approximately 200 people participated, including city officials, local business persons, community representatives and educators, in what is destined to be an annual collaborative community development planning process.  Staff participated on a what turned out to be the best attended panel explaining regulatory issues and answering questions from the public.  Questions ranged from permitting, to financing, to the AQMP.  A number of follow-up materials have been requested by the business community

<P><b>Report:</b><blockquote> Lead Agency Projects and Environmental Documents 
 Received by the AQMD</blockquote>
<P><b>Synopsis:</b><blockquote>This report provides for the Board&#146;s consideration a listing of CEQA documents received by the AQMD between October 6, 1996 and November 1, 1996, and those projects for which the AQMD is acting as lead agency pursuant to CEQA.</blockquote>

<P> James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<br> Executive Officer
<P><hr>
<P><B>Background</B>
<P><B>EIR and Document Log (Attachments A and B)</B> - Each month, the AQMD receives numerous CEQA documents from other public agencies on projects which could adversely affect air quality.  A listing of all documents received for review during the past month is contained in Attachment A.  Monthly listings which are shaded note those CEQA documents for which the AQMD staff has or will prepare and submit comments to the lead agency.  A list of active projects from previous months for which AQMD staff is continuing to evaluate or prepare comments is included as Attachment B.  The column captioned &quot;Public Concerns&quot; identifies parties who have contacted the AQMD with concerns or issues about the proposed project.  A notation of 1 in this column indicates the contact was supportive of the project noted.  A notation of 2 indicates the party was opposed or expressed concerns about the project.  A notation of 3 indicates that no one contacted the AQMD about that project.
<P>In the past, AQMD staff routinely reviewed many of these documents and commented upon the air quality analyses and possible impacts on the air quality of the district.  Due to staffing constraints, the AQMD is no longer able to routinely comment on all CEQA documents received.  Publication of the Board-approved <I>CEQA Air</I> <I>Quality Handbook</I>, however, has provided local governments and other public agencies with the necessary information to prepare appropriate air quality analyses on projects for which they act as lead agency.  As resources permit, staff evaluates and may prepare comments for projects that may have significant adverse regional air quality impacts (e.g., special event centers, landfills, etc.) and those projects for which a lead or responsible agency has specifically requested AQMD review.
<P><B>AQMD Lead Agency Projects (Attachment C)</B> - Pursuant to CEQA, the AQMD periodically acts as lead agency on stationary source permit projects.  Under CEQA the lead agency is responsible for determining whether an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) or a Negative Declaration is necessary for any proposal considered to be a &quot;project&quot; as defined by CEQA.  An EIR is prepared when the AQMD as lead agency finds substantial evidence that the proposed project may have a significant adverse effect on the environment.  A Negative Declaration may be prepared if the AQMD determines that the proposed project will not generate significant adverse environmental impacts.  The Negative Declaration is a written statement describing the reasons a proposed project will not have a significant adverse effect on the environment and, therefore, does not require the preparation of an EIR.
<P>Attachment C to this report summarizes the active projects for which the AQMD is lead agency and is currently preparing or has prepared environmental documentation.  As noted in Attachment C, through October 1996, the AQMD continued working on CEQA documents for three (3) active projects.
<P>To date in 1996, the AQMD, as lead agency, prepared or contracted for the preparation of and certified five (5) CEQA documents for stationary source permit projects.

<P>BOARD MEETING DATE:  December 13, 1996 AGENDA NO. 25</b></center><br><p><br>
<P><b>Report:</b><blockquote>Administrative Committee</blockquote>
<P><b>Synopsis:</b><blockquote>The Administrative Committee met Friday, November 22, 1996, and reviewed the proposed agenda for the December 13, 1996 Board meeting.  The Committee also discussed various issues detailed in the Committee report.  The next Administrative Committee meeting is Friday, December 20, 1996, at 9:30 a.m., in Conference Room CC8.</blockquote>
<P><b>Recommended Action:</b>
<blockquote>Receive and File this report.</blockquote>
<P> Jon D. Mikels, Chairman
<br> Administrative Committee
<P><hr>
<P><B>Attendance:</B>
<P>Present were Jon Mikels and Committee Members Candace Haggard and Leonard Paulitz.  Absent were Committee Members Michael Antonovich, Dr. William A. Burke, and Mee Hae Lee.  Board Member Nell Soto also was present.  In the absence of the foregoing Committee Members, and pursuant to the Procedure for Standing Committees of the Governing Board, adopted March 8, 1996, Chairman Mikels appointed Ms. Soto as an <I>ad hoc</I> member of the Administrative Committee for the meeting of November 22, 1996 only.
<P><B>Administrative Committee Discussion Items:</B>
<P><I><U>Proposition 209</U></I><I>:  </I>Following General Counsel&#146;s briefing on the possible effects of Proposition 209 on the District and other state and federal agencies, discussion followed relative to Proposition 209 impacts on the District as a recipient of federal Section 105 grants, the District&#146;s sub-contracting policies, its system for awarding preference points in RFP evaluations/contract awards, and its outreach activities.  General Counsel also reported on the currently pending U.S. District Court (San Francisco) case filed by Proposition 209 opponents to block implementation of the law.  A hearing and preliminary decision in this case were reportedly expected in the interim before the December 13 Governing Board meeting.  General Counsel was asked to report on the status of the requested injunction at the December 13, 1996 Board meeting, and the Committee unanimously recommended that the District&#146;s current policies concerning M/WBE contracts and outreach remain in effect.
<P><I><U>Distribution of Funds to RTAC Pursuant to SB 836 for Voluntary Ridesharing</U></I><I>:  </I>The Committee was advised by District Counsel Barbara Baird that the District would seek RTAC&#146;s recommendation as to the rideshare agency or agencies through which these funds should be distributed, inasmuch as RTAC is not a legal entity to which the District could directly distribute funds.  Ms. Baird noted that, to comply with the spirit of Senator Lewis&#146; legislation, the District could distribute money to one or more ride-share agencies, the ultimate recipients of such funds.  The Committee then briefly discussed the development and funding of methodology to track program effectiveness.
<P><I><U>Approval of Compensation for Board Member Assistant(s)</U></I><I>:  </I>No requests.
<P><B>Proposed District Expenditure for Out-of-Country Travel:</B>  None.
<P><B>Staff Recommendations for December 13, 1996 Board Meeting</B>
<P><B>Recommended for Approval by the Administrative Committee:</B>
<P>1. Reorganization of the Advisory Council:  The Committee reviewed and discussed the issues raised by various commentors [ Gas Company, CCEEB, the Sanitation Districts of Orange and Los Angeles Counties, the City of Los Angeles, and two individuals.]  in response to staff&#146;s solicitation of same subsequent to the October 18 meeting of the Administrative Committee (a summary of said comments is included in the corresponding Board letter, agenda item #5).  The Committee determined that the reorganization of the Advisory Council and its subordinate Advisory Groups, as well as appointments of Advisory Group members to serve on the Advisory Council, would remain as recommended.  However, in response to certain of the referenced comments, Chairman Mikels recommended that the Advisory Group Charters be enhanced to better define the various groups&#146; responsibilities, and specifically to involve periodic AQMP review functions.  <I>Moved (Paulitz), seconded (Haggard), and unanimously approved, with the </I><I>understanding that staff will bring revised Charters back to the Committee for consideration.</I>
<P>2. Establish 1997 Board Meeting Schedule:  <I>Moved (Soto), seconded (Paulitz), and unanimously </I><I>approved.</I>

<P><B>Program Opportunity Notice (PON) Update</B>
<P> Jon Leonard gave a brief update on the current PON, which was issued last month and closes on November 19, 1996.  Jon indicated that, based on telephone calls and written inquiries, interest in the PON is widespread, and Technology Advancement can expect 50 or more pre-proposals to be submitted.
<P><B>Research Program Concept:  &quot;Ozone Exposure&quot; Control Project</B>
<P> Chris Abe gave a presentation on the &quot;Ozone Exposure&quot; Reduction Project which proposes air quality modeling and local demonstrations focused on two ozone control measures:  1) air exchanger-bound catalysts; and 2) the &quot;Cool Communities&quot; concept which promotes the use of lighter color roofing and paving materials and increased vegetation to reduce ambient temperatures and photochemical ozone formation.
<P><B>Committee Topics</B>
<P><B>1.</B><B> </B><B>Award Contract for Air Quality Modeling Evaluation of an Ozone Control Strategy </B><B>Focusing on Air conditioning-Bound Catalysts for Ozone Scrubbing</B>
<P> Control Strategies targeting high ozone receptor areas have been proposed as alternatives to more stringent Basin-wide emission controls.  One promising strategy is the use of air conditioning-bound catalysts for ozone scrubbing.  Based on a competitive solicitation, ICF Kaiser Consulting Group, Systems Applications International, Inc. has been selected to conduct air quality modeling to evaluate the feasibility of this strategy to evaluate the feasibility of this strategy.  It was brought to Committee members&#146; attention that staff had not recommended the lower cost bidder, who had scored the highest number of points.  Staff recommended the firm which had the higher technical rating, as the cost differential was minimal while the spread of technical points was significant.  The Committee concurred with this recommendation.  Total project cost is $49,457.  <I>The Committee reviewed the information presented, and noted their approval </I><I>of staff&#146;s recommendation.</I>
<P><B>2.</B><B> </B><B>Award Contract for Air Quality Modeling Evaluation of the &quot;Cool Communities&quot; Ozone </B><B>Control Strategy</B>
<P> The use of light color roofing and paving materials and increased tree planting has been suggested as a strategy to reduce temperatures in high ozone receptor areas, decreasing ozone formation and energy demand for cooling.  Based on results of a competitive solicitation, Environ International Corporation has been selected to conduct air quality modeling to evaluate the feasibility of the &quot;Cool Communities&quot; strategy.  Total project cost is $44,967.  <I>The Committee reviewed the information presented and noted their approval </I><I>of staff&#146;s recommendation.</I>
<P><B>3.</B><B> </B><B>Issue RFP to Measure Evaporative Emissions From Off-Road Equipment Powered by </B><B>Gasoline and Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) Engines of 25 to Less Than 175 </B><B>Horsepower</B>
<P> Off-road equipment powered by gasoline and LPG engines of 25 to less than 175 horsepower contribute significantly to the South Coast Air Basin&#146;s mobile-source emissions.  There are currently no emissions standards and control requirements for these engines.  The proposed RFP asks for measurement of evaporative emissions from this equipment.  The emissions will be used to suggest cost-effective control methods with estimation of potential emissions benefits.  Staff pointed out to Committee members that cost effectiveness, i.e., cost weighted by technical strength, would be used as a significant criterion for scoring the cost component in proposal evaluation.  This deviates from the general practice of using total costs as the sole criterion.  The Committee members present agreed with this scoring concept.  The AQMD is the sole participant in this project, and the total funding shall not exceed $150,000.  <I>The Committee reviewed the </I><I>information presented and noted their approval of staff&#146;s recommendation.</I>
<P><B>4.</B><B> </B><B>Execute Contract with CARB to Cost-Share Heavy-Duty Vehicle Fleet Characterization </B><B>for Reduction of NOx and Particulate Matter Emissions in the South Coast Air Basin</B>
<P> The objective of this project is to obtain detailed activity and usage data for heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) operating in the Basin to enable the design of incentive programs to increase the percentage of HDVs with low-emitting engines.  The incentive programs supported by the ARB will assist the AQMD&#146;s efforts to attain ambient air quality standards for ozone and particulates in the South Coast Air Basin.  AQMD funding for this $200,000 project shall not exceed $100,000.  The remaining balance will be funded by the ARB.  <I>The Committee reviewed the information presented and noted their approval </I><I>of staff&#146;s recommendation.</I>
<P><B>5.</B><B> </B><B>Issue RFP to Developm and Demonstrate Fast Charging Systems for Electric Vehicles</B>
<P> Automotive original-equipment manufacturers have announced the introduction of their EVs.  Besides higher capacity batteries, fast charging systems for EVs have been identified as an area in which new technology is needed.  It is proposed that the AQMD issue an RFP to expedite the development of this charging technology.  Staff pointed out to Committee members that cost effectiveness, i.e., cost weighted by technical strength, would be used as a significant criterion for scoring the cost component in proposal evaluation.  This deviates from the general practice of using total costs as the sole criterion.  The Committee members present agreed with this scoring concept.  AQMD funding of $1,000,000 for multiple projects is proposed.  Expected cost-sharing is $2,000,000 with a total project value of $3,000,000.  <I>One Committee </I><I>member left the meeting early and, therefore, less than three members were present.  </I><I>Pursuant to the Procedures for Standing Committees of the Governing Board, the </I><I>Committee provides this communication but no recommendation.</I>
<P><B>6.</B> <B>Issue RFP to Study the Use and Impacts of Advanced Batteries in Electric Vehicles</B>
<P> Automotive original-equipment manufacturers have announced the introduction of their EVs, many with lead-acid batteries.  Three manufacturers will sell EVs next year with advanced, higher-capacity batteries which increase EV range by 50%.  These batteries may substantially alter EV usage, charging patterns and utility impacts compared to lead-acid batteries.  This RFP solicits bids to conduct a study of the market and infrastructure impacts of advanced batteries in EVs.  This information is crucial to ZEV introduction.  Staff pointed out to Committee members that cost effectiveness, i.e., cost weighted by technical strength, would be used as a significant criterion for scoring the cost component in proposal evaluation.  This deviates from the general practice of using total costs as the sole criterion.  The Committee members present agreed with this scoring concept.  Total funding is $480,000 including $240,000 being provided by the ARB.  <I>One Committee member left the meeting early and, therefore, less than three members </I><I>were present.  Pursuant to the Procedures for Standing Committees of the Governing </I><I>Board, the Committee provides this communication but no recommendation.</I>
<P><B>Other Business</B>
<P>A discussion was held regarding the necessity of having a December meeting of the Technology Committee.  It was decided that the Committee would meet on December 20, 1996 at 11:00 a.m. in CC-8.
<P><B>Public Comment Period</B>
<P>There was no public comment.

<P><b>Recommended Action:</b>
<blockquote>Set Public Hearing January 10, 1997 to Amend Rule 403 - Fugitive Dust and Adopt 
Rule 1186 - PM<SUB>10</SUB> Emissions from Paved and Unpaved Roads and Livestock Operations</blockquote>
<P> James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<br> Executive Officer
<P><hr>
<P><B>Background</B>
<P>The South Coast Air Basin (Basin) exceeds state and federal air quality standards for PM<SUB>10</SUB> (defined as particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 10 microns or less).  As a result of these exceedances, the Basin has been designated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) as a &quot;serious nonattainment area&quot; for PM<SUB>10</SUB>.  Under the federal Clean Air Act (CAA), the South Coast Air Quality Management District (District) is required to implement best available control measures (BACM) for fugitive dust sources by February 8, 1997.  The District also is required to adopt contingency measures in regulatory form by February 8, 1997 to be implemented if the area does not achieve sufficient progress towards attainment.  In 1994, the District prepared and adopted a &quot;serious nonattainment area&quot; PM<SUB>10</SUB> SIP revision (1994 BACM SIP, Appendix I-D of 1994 AQMP) that identified candidate BACM for fugitive dust sources.  The 1994 BACM SIP committed the District to adopt all candidate BACM by February 8, 1997, except any measure that does not meet the established technical and cost-feasibility criteria. 
<P>District staff has completed the BACM technical and cost-feasibility analysis and has incorporated the BACM that meet or exceed the 1994 BACM SIP criteria into proposed amendments to District Rule 403 (PAR 403) and proposed Rule 1186 (PR 1186).  BACM that did not meet the established criteria are proposed in PAR 403 and PR 1186 as contingency measures to be implemented only if required by the U.S. EPA. 
<P><B>Proposal</B>
<P>The BACM amendments to Rule 403 would require an incremental increase in the amount of fugitive dust control at construction sites, aggregate facilities, and landfills.  Agricultural operations, exempted under existing Rule 403, could maintain the exemption provided that a soil erosion control plan is filed with the Natural Resource Conservation Service and forwarded to the District.  A contingency measure is also proposed that would lower the threshold definition for activities required to file a plan or submit a notification.
<P>PR 1186 seeks to reduce the amount of PM<SUB>10</SUB> from paved and unpaved roads and from livestock operations.  The PR 1186 requirements would primarily impact the governmental agencies responsible for paved and unpaved road maintenance and certain livestock facilities.  Exemptions are provided for unpaved roads with less than 50 average daily trips and livestock operations less than 10 acres.  Contingency requirements are also proposed for new road construction and weed abatement activities.

<P><B>Policy Issues</B>
<P>Staff developed the routine street sweeping control measure based on a demonstration project conducted by the Coachella Valley Association of Governments.  In the study, the UC Riverside College of Engineering - Center for Environmental Research and Technology (CE-CERT) used four vacuum-based (PM<SUB>10</SUB>-efficient) street sweepers, outfitted with filtration systems, and one mechanical broom sweeper within an artificial tunnel to determine the amount of material removed from the road and the amount of material resuspended or vented by the equipment itself.  The study determined that vacuum sweepers and broom sweepers were similarly effective in removing material from the road.  However, the study also determined that two of the PM<SUB>10</SUB>-efficient street sweepers represented an eighty percent reduction in the amount of PM<SUB>10</SUB> reentrained or vented from a broom sweeper.  On this basis, and utilizing BACM guidance provided by the U.S. EPA, staff incorporated street sweeping into PR 1186.
<P>As part of the public process, local jurisdictions and street sweeper There are no policy issues associated with the proposed amendment.manufacturers provided several suggestions and introduced issues regarding the PR 1186 requirements for the future procurement of PM<SUB>10</SUB>-efficient street sweepers.  Specifically, there is information that current PM<SUB>10</SUB>-efficient street sweepers typically travel at two-thirds the speed of a non PM<SUB>10</SUB>-efficient street sweeper.  Thus, a jurisdiction may need to purchase three PM<SUB>10</SUB>-efficient street sweepers for each two non PM<SUB>10</SUB>-efficient street sweepers being replaced.  Moreover, PM<SUB>10</SUB>-efficient street sweepers are generally not capable of removing heavy or oversized material (e.g., rocks or garbage) and may not be appropriate for street cleaning under certain conditions.
<P>Staff is committed to resolve the concerns over the PR 1186 street sweeper requirements raised at the public consultation meeting, the public workshop, and from meetings with local jurisdictions and street sweeper manufacturers.  One alternative under consideration would limit the applicability of PM<SUB>10</SUB>-efficient street sweeper use to areas where the greatest surface street dust loadings are most prominent.
<P>Other PR 1186 items of concern expressed by some local jurisdictions include:  the &quot;post-event&quot; street cleaning provisions, the unpaved road treatment requirements, and the contingency requirements to conduct mowing instead of discing for weed abatement.  Specifically, concern was expressed that following a major rain storm, it may not be practical for a jurisdiction responsible for thousands of miles of paved roads to conduct street cleaning on all roads impacted by erosion within 72 hours after the event.  Regarding the unpaved road treatment requirements, jurisdictions stated that existing budgets are insufficient to conduct a capital improvement program to pave unpaved roads and that the passage of Proposition 218 may affect their ability to establish assessment districts to conduct paving.  Some jurisdictions and fire departments expressed concerns over the cost of mowing versus discing as mowing may be required as many as three times per year.
<P>The staff is in the process of resolving these issues and will be preparing additional rule modifications to be included in the final proposal rule package.  An additional public workshop has been scheduled for December 4, 1996, to present these rule modifications and solicit further public input.

<P><B>AQMP and Legal Mandates</B>
<P>The proposed requirements are estimated to result in a reduction of 30,806 tons of PM<SUB>10</SUB> per year, or 84.4 tons per day (PAR = 42.9 tons per day and PR 1186 = 41.5 tons per day).  These emissions reductions are necessary as part of the District's 1997 Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP) attainment strategy to achieve the PM<SUB>10</SUB> standards by 2006.  Moreover, the implementation of BACM is necessary to qualify for U.S. EPA's recently issued Natural Events Policy.
<P><B>CEQA</B>
<P>Pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Section 15153, a CEQA Lead Agency may use an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) prepared in connection with an earlier project to apply to a later project if the circumstances of the project are essentially the same.  District staff has determined that the Environmental Impact Report (EIR) prepared for the 1997 Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP) (SCH#96011062) adequately analyzes the potential adverse environmental impacts from the proposed project.  The EIR for the 1997 AQMP includes an analysis of the PM<SUB>10</SUB> BACM from which PAR 403 and PR 1186 are directly derived.  
<P><B>Socioeconomic Assessment</B>
<P>Staff has estimated the cost of compliance with the proposed requirements, which are included in the draft staff report.  The estimated cost-effectiveness of PAR 403 is $90 per ton.  The estimated cost-effectiveness of PR 1186 is $209 per ton.  The total cost-effectiveness of PAR 403 and PR 1186 is $157 per ton.

<P><B>Resource Impact</B>
<P>Existing District resources will be sufficient to implement the proposed rule requirements with minimal impact on the budget.

BOARD MEETING DATE:  December 13, 1996 AGENDA NO. 30</b></center><br><p><br>
<P><B>Proposal:</B><blockquote>Amend Rule 1130.1 - Screen Printing Operations </blockquote>
<P><B>Synopsis:</B><blockquote>Proposed amendments will address concerns raised by the industry, ink manufacturers, and staff by creating higher VOC limits for various screen printing operations and postponing the implementation of the lower VOC limit for extreme performance applications.  The amendments will result in a permanent emission reduction loss of 0.13 ton per day and delay the 0.28 ton per day emission reduction associated with extreme performance applications from 1998 to 2003.
</blockquote>

<P><B>Committee:</B><blockquote> Stationary Source, December 5, 1996, Reviewed.</blockquote>
<P><B>Recommended Action:</B>
<P><oL><LI>Certify the Final Subsequent Environmental Assessment for 
  Proposed Amended Rule 1130.1 - Screen Printing Operations, in accordance with the attached Resolution.
<P><LI>Amend Rule 1130.1 - Screen Printing Operations</ol>
<P> James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<br> Executive Officer
<P><HR>
<P><B>Background</B>
<P>Rule 1130.1 - Screen Printing Operations regulates emissions of VOCs from screen printing operations.  Screen prints are created by passing printing materials (inks, coatings, or adhesives) through stenciled screens.  Products produced include T-shirts, indoor and outdoor signs, posters, decals, printed circuit boards, banners, and skateboards.  There are approximately 3,000 to 4,000 screen printers operating in the AQMD.
<P>Prior to the adoption of Rule 1130.1 on August 2, 1991, screen printers were subject to the requirements of Rule 1130 - Graphic Arts.  At the request of the screen printing industry, Rule 1130.1 was developed to reflect the vast array of inks and substrates used by the industry.  The  original rule required the use of low-VOC screen printing materials to minimize VOC emissions from screen printing operations.  The VOC limits for screen printing materials were established for specific products, substrates, and general categories and took effect on  July 1, 1992.  The rule also contained many technology-forcing VOC limits with a future implementation date of January 1, 1995.  These effective dates were developed through the combined efforts of ink manufacturers, screen printers, the Screenprinting &amp; Graphic Imaging Association International and AQMD staff.  At the time Rule 1130.1 was adopted, it was estimated that implementation of the July 1, 1992 and January 1, 1995 VOC limits would result in an emission reduction of 3.07 tons per day.
<P>While the vast majority of screen printers complied with the July 1, 1992 VOC limits, approximately 200 screen printers requested and received variances from the AQMD Hearing Board during the second half of 1992.  Based on the testimony provided at the hearings and independent investigations, AQMD staff determined that, for certain applications, compliant inks with acceptable performance characteristics were either not available or the available compliant technology was not cost-effective.  The rule was amended on July 9, 1993 to reflect the available feasible technology.  In this amendment, the VOC limits were increased for those products and substrates for which compliant inks were either unavailable or cost prohibitive.  However, most of the final technology-forcing limits, which were to become effective on January 1, 1995,  were not changed.  This approach was taken to encourage ink manufacturers to aggressively pursue the development of low-VOC inks and, in the interim, allow screen printers and ink manufacturers to comply with the rule.  Based on changes included in the amendment, the emission reductions associated with the rule were revised from 3.07 to 2.76 tons per day.
<P>Due to the development of new screen printing materials, compliance with the January 1, 1995 rule limits was possible for many applications.  However, there were certain products, substrates, and screen printing materials for which compliance was not achievable because either compliant screen printing materials with the required performance characteristics had not been developed or the compliant technology was cost prohibitive.  As a result, six major ink manufacturers were granted product variances for specific screen printing materials and applications in late 1994 and early 1995.  These product variances are scheduled to expire in December 1996.  Most of the screen printed products covered under these variances are made of plastics.  However, products made of other substrates such as metal and man-made textiles are also included in these variances.
<P>The quantity of inks used on the products covered by the variances in the AQMD is relatively low.  As a result, there is very little incentive for resin manufacturers and ink formulators to develop compliant inks.  Moreover, VOC emissions associated with these products are low.  Thus, AQMD staff is proposing to increase the limits for these products without any future technology-forcing limits.  AQMD staff is also proposing to delay the January 1, 1998 limit of 3.3 lbs/gal for the extreme performance category until January 1, 2003.  As a result of these proposed amendments, the emission reductions due to the implementation of this rule are being revised to 2.63 tons per day.  To date, the rule has resulted in an emission reduction of 2.35 tons per day which is 76% of the emission reduction originally proposed in 1991.
<P><B>Proposal</B>
<P>The following changes are proposed:
<P>1. Increase the current limit of 400 gms/liter to 800 gms/liter effective December 13, 1996 for the following screen printed products, substrates, and screen printing materials.
<P><UL><LI> Plastic containers such as bottles, pails, jars, and tubes.
<li>Plastic mechanically-formed products such as bike helmets, restaurant table signs, and embossed control panels.
<LI>Opaque inks used for making water slide decals.
<li>Plastic overlays used in products such as computer keyboards, control panels, and microwave ovens.
<li>Flags, banners, signs, or displays made of polyethylene plastic.
<li>Sub-printed products.  These are plastic products where the ink is printed on the unexposed side and then covered with an adhesive to allow the product to be attached to another substrate.
<li>High-VOC serigraph inks used  for making color paintings.
<li>Scratch-off inks used to make products such as lottery tickets and contest games.
<li>Man-made textile products such as banners, flags, tote bags, and jackets.
</ul>
<P>2. Increase the existing VOC limit of 400 gms/liter to 600 gms/liter for printing on glass and metal for decorative purposes.  This limit will be consistent with the existing limit for printing on glass and metal for specification purposes.
<P>3. Increase the existing VOC limit of 600 gms/liter to 800 gms/liter for dyes used on unsealed aluminum substrates. 
<P>4. Increase the existing VOC limit of 400 gms/liter to 540 gms/liter for fluorescent inks.  Fluorescent inks glow brighter than conventional inks when exposed to the same light and are used on posters and banners.
<P>5. Increase the existing 400 gms/liter VOC limit to 745 gms/liter for fine detail loose-leaf binder ink and loose-leaf binder metallic inks.  The fine detail loose-leaf binder inks are used on loose-leaf binders to print very small graphics on darker backgrounds and loose-leaf binder metallic inks are inks which contain at least 50 grams of elemental metal particles per liter of ink as applied.
<P>6. Delay the future 400 gms/liter limit for extreme performance inks from January 1, 1998 to January 1, 2003.
<P><I>7.</I><I> </I>Restrict the high-VOC serigraph ink usage to 10% (by volume) of the total serigraph inks used at a facility, on a monthly basis.
<P>8. Establish a minimum control device efficiency at 95% by weight.
<P>9. Include the capture efficiency test methods revised by the USEPA.
<P>10. Establish that all test methods referenced in the rule shall be the most recent versions approved by the AQMD, ARB, and USEPA.
<P>11. Delete the reference to variances granted by the AQMD Hearing Board from the rule because USEPA does not recognize these variances. 
<P>In addition, staff has added a rule &quot;Purpose&quot; section,  modified the &quot;Applicability&quot; section, added a reference to the exempt compound list in Rule 102 - Definition of Terms, and improved the rule language by adding, deleting, and refining definitions.
<P>Increasing the VOC limits will result in a permanent emission reduction loss of  approximately 0.13 ton per day.  Additionally, delaying the extreme performance future limit to the year 2003 will result in a delay of the associated 0.28 ton per day emission reduction.

<P><B>AQMP</B>
<P>The 1994 AQMP contained control measure CM #94CTS-I for further emission reductions from the screen printing industry.  During the development of the 1997 AQMP, it was determined that further emission reductions from this industry may not be cost-effective.  For this reason, the control measure for this industry is proposed to be included in the &quot;Further Evaluation Measures&quot; category.
<P><B>CEQA</B>
<P>The AQMD has reviewed the proposed amendments to Rule 1130.1 pursuant to CEQA and has prepared a Draft Subsequent Environmental Assessment (SEA).  The Draft SEA analyzed the potential adverse environmental impacts associated with the proposed project and was circulated for a 45-day public review and comment period which ended on November 8, 1996. No comments were received on the Draft SEA and it is now a Final SEA.  Minor changes were made to the Draft SEA which are noted using strikethrough and underline.
<P><B>Socioeconomic Analysis</B>
<P>Socioeconomic analysis indicates that no adverse socioeconomic impacts are expected from the proposed amendments to Rule 1130.1.
<P><B>Implementation Plan</B>
<P>Staff is working with industry to help screen printers understand the rule more clearly and comply with its requirements.  At the request of industry, staff has already developed a guideline on obtaining an extreme performance classification approval.  This document has been available to screen printers since early December, 1996.

<P><B>Resource Impact</B>
<P>Existing AQMD resources will be sufficient to implement the proposed changes to this rule with no impact on the budget.

<P>2. Amend Rule 219 - Equipment Not Requiring a Written Permit Pursuant to 
  Regulation II, in accordance with the attached Resolution.</blockquote>
<P>  James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<br>  Executive Officer
<P><hr>
<P><B>Background</B>
<P>Rule 219 is an administrative rule which identifies certain equipment categories for exemption from AQMD written permit.  This rule has been amended several times, the last on August 12, 1994.  This rule amendment was prompted by the adoption of the 1996 AQMD Regulatory Reform Initiative, as well as various changes to state law.  For this rule amendment, emphasis was based on achieving the following objectives:
<P><UL><LI> Implement the first tier of the 1996 AQMD Regulatory Reform Initiative by exempting certain equipment categories with negligible emission potential and those chlorinated fluorinated carbon (CFC) recovery or recycling systems currently subject to EPA&#146;s Refrigerant Certification Program requirements.

<P><LI>Provide consistency with California Health and Safety Code (H&amp;SC) Section 41753, which preempts local air districts from imposing permitting requirements on portable internal combustion engines (ICEs) participating in the Statewide Registration Program (H&amp;SC 41750~41755).

<P><LI>Address implementation of state Air Toxic Control Measure (ATCM) and federal NESHAP requirements.
</UL>
<P><B>Proposal</B>
<P>Revise Rule 219 to:
<P><UL><LI> Eliminate written permits for approximately 4,400 CFC recovery and recycling systems  and approximately 4,400 portable ICEs.  Through reevaluation of other equipment categories, staff has identified an additional 2,000 permit units that represent a negligible emission potential and propose that these units also be eliminated from the AQMD&#146;s permit system.
<P><LI> Exclude from exemption any equipment subject to ATCMs or NESHAPs, resulting in the addition of approximately 500 new permits to the system.  Due to the nature of the equipment subject to these requirements, and the mandates to ensure compliance with applicable state and federal requirements, a written permit requirement is deemed appropriate for this equipment.</UL>
<P><B>Policy Issues</B>
<P>Staff received various requests from industry to add specific equipment exemptions to the proposed rule, and has worked with various industry representatives to determine the viability of exempting these equipment categories.  A public workshop was held on September 5, 1996, where staff received additional comments on the proposed amendments to Rule 219.
<P>Staff has addressed the concerns raised by industry and the public in Appendix A - Response to Comments of the Final Staff Report for Proposed Amended Rule 219.  Remaining unresolved comments dealt with the exemption of additional equipment categories.  Staff will continue to work on these requests for possible consideration in a subsequent amendment of this rule scheduled for late 1997.  These comments and the responses made by staff are also included in Appendix A of the Final Staff Report.
<P><B>AQMP &amp; Legal Mandates</B>
<P>Equipment categories which would be exempt from written permit as a result of this proposed amended rule are either not subject to BACT, or will participate in the Statewide Registration Program.  In either instance, no emission impacts are anticipated as a result of this proposed rule.  Proposed Rule 219 is not an AQMP measure.  This amendment makes Rule 219 consistent with California Health and Safety Code (H&amp;SC) Sections 41750~41755 (portable internal combustion engines).
<P><B>CEQA &amp; Socioeconomic Analysis</B>
<P>Staff has reviewed the proposed amendments to Rule 219 and has determined that they are exempt from the requirements of CEQA.  The amendments are administrative in nature and will not significantly impact the emission levels currently associated with the existing rule.  Therefore, a Notice of Exemption has been prepared pursuant to state CEQA Guidelines Section 15002  (k)(1).  The Notice of Exemption will be filed with the county clerks immediately following the adoption of the proposed amendments.
<P>The proposed amendments to Rule 219 are not expected to result in cost impacts, overall.  The detailed assessment is attached.
<P><B>Implementation Plan</B>
<P>Due to the substantial number of permits to be eliminated as a result of this rule amendment, affected sources will be contacted by mail and directed to appropriate AQMD personnel for assistance in making the necessary permit changes. 
<P><B>Resource Impact</B>
<P>Implementation of the proposed amended rule will result in an estimated net reduction in fee revenues of approximately $1.47 million per year comprised of the following: 
<P><table><tr><td> Equipment with negligible emissions<td>$465,000 reduction
<tr><td> Equipment regulated by other governmental entities<td>$409,000 reduction
<tr><td>Equipment exempt pursuant to state law <td>$754,000 reduction
<tr><td>Equipment subject to NESHAP/ATCM requirements<td>(  $157,000) increase.
<tr><TD><TD>$1,471,000</table>
<P>This information is summarized in the table below.  A more detailed breakdown is provided in Appendix B - Emission Inventory and Fee Revenue Data of the Final Staff Report.  The removal of approximately 10,000 permits from the permit system will involve additional work on behalf of AQMD staff in the first year.  During this time, existing resources will be utilized to conduct outreach and appropriate permit and billing revisions for those sources affected by the proposed amendments.  In addition, it is estimated that the removal of these equipment categories from the permit system will eliminate compliance inspections for those facilities exclusively operating these types of equipment.  For those facilities operating permitted equipment in addition to the categories proposed for exemption, it is estimated that the total time to complete a compliance inspection will be reduced by an average of 10 to 15 minutes.  Any compliance resources saved as a result of this amendment will be reallocated to complaint response or other targeted inspection programs.
<P>The proposed amendments will also reduce the number of new applications received by approximately 1,000 per year.  This will result in the reallocation of approximately 4,000 administrative and engineering hours to other permitting activities.  In the first year, these resources will be reallocated to process the estimated 500 new applications resulting from the new small halogenated degreaser NESHAP permit requirements.  In subsequent years, these resources will be used to process any new applications resulting from NESHAP promulgation, as well as meeting other permit streamlining goals .

<P><b>Proposal:</b><blockquote>Reorganize the Advisory Council</blockquote>
<P><b>Synopsis:</b><blockquote>At its January 12, 1996 meeting, the Governing Board asked the Administrative Committee to undertake a comprehensive evaluation of the Advisory Council&#146;s composition, duties and activities, and provide the Board with recommendations for its consideration.  This action is to provide recommendations regarding the reorganization of the Advisory Council.</blockquote>
<b>Committee:</b><blockquote>Administrative, November 22, 1996, Recommended for Approval</blockquote>
<P><b>Recommendation:</b>
<blockquote>Rename certain existing advisory committees/task forces as Advisory Groups; establish the composition and terms of the Advisory Council (to include representatives from each Advisory Group); and define the responsibilities of the Advisory Council.</blockquote>
<P>  James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<br>  Executive Officer
<P><hr>
<P><B>Background</B>
<P>Beginning in approximately the early 1950s, the Los Angeles Air Pollution Control District had two &quot;advisory&quot; groups.  One was an advisory council which consisted of approximately twelve members, including mayors, physicians, and industry and chamber of commerce representatives.  These were appointed by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors (the then-governing body for the air pollution control district) and one was appointed by the Governor.  The second was a 5-member Board of Consultants consisting of prominent citizens, including the heads of the UCLA and USC Medical Schools.
<P>The Board of Consultants provided advice to staff on draft rules.  The rules were then presented to the advisory council.  Their recommendations were forwarded to the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors for adoption.  (This process was necessary since the Board of Supervisors met on air quality matters only two or three times a year.)  Over time these two historic groups evolved into an &quot;Advisory Council.&quot;
<P>When the present South Coast Air Quality Management District was formed in 1977, the advisory council concept was retained, and in 1980 added to statute [  Health & Safety Code Section 40428:  "There is continued in existence the South Coast Air Quality Management District Advisory Council, which is appointed by the south coast district board, to advise and consult with the south coast district board in effectuating the purpose of this division.  The membership and rules of the advisory council shall be as established by resolution of the south coast district board."] .  Over the past twenty years, the AQMD has addressed increasingly complex issues relating to the regulation of pollutants, with ever more in-depth evaluations of health and socioeconomic impacts.  Today&#146;s AQMD staff is a highly educated, diversified group of professionals with expertise in a wide range of health and environmental fields.  To complement their efforts, both staff and the Governing Board have established various advisory groups, panels, task forces, and committees to provide input into the development of recommended policies and proposals.  These task-specific groups have assumed the evaluation of issues which might formerly have been brought to the ADVISORY COUNCIL.  
<P>The resignation in August of some of the ADVISORY COUNCIL members focused attention on the fact that the various advisory groups now in existence handle a variety of issues, and that there is overlap.  The Administrative Committee has evaluated the various committees, task forces, and advisory groups in existence and recommends some consolidation and reorganization to more effectively and efficiently meet the needs of the Governing Board.
<P>A draft of this letter was sent to all members of the Interagency AQMP Implementation Committee (IAIC), the IAIC Technical Advisory Committee (IAIC-TAC), the Ethnic Community Advisory Council, the Socioeconomic Technical Review Committee, the Technology Advancement External Review Group, and the Home Rule Working Group.  Eight responses were received and these are attached and summarized in Attachment A.  The major points made include:
<P><ol><li>The size of the Advisory Council at 31 was thought to be too large (CCEEB, Pacific Enterprises, County Sanitation Districts of Orange County) and it was suggested (a) that only 2 members of each Advisory Group be appointed to bring membership to 25 (CCEEB) and (b) that there be a Technical Advisory Committee to the Advisory Council (Pacific Enterprises).

<P><li>Some criteria for Board representation on the Council may be helpful to ensure that it is well balanced and represents all points of view (CCEEB) and a liberal use of alternates should be addressed (County Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County).

<P><li>The economic impact of regulations on Southern California should be added to the charter of at least one advisory group (CCEEB and Pacific Enterprises). 

<P><li>The AQMP group seems unnecessary - much of their input can be covered by other five groups and by special ad hoc groups (County Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County and County Sanitation Districts of Orange County).
<P><li>Three principles should be considered: 
<BR>(a) Participants in advisory function must represent good cross-section of the 
  community and must be dedicated to assuring continued progress to a healthier 
 region, both physical health and economic health; 
<BR>(b) AQMD should have an ongoing relationship with these individuals so that it can 
 rely on their continuing understanding of the challenges the AQMD faces; 
 <br>(c) Each area of expertise should be able to provide the Board with an in-depth 
  analysis of (1) economic and business issues, (2) health and environmental issues, 
  (3) technical and engineering issues, and (4) community impact (Pacific Enterprises).

<P><li> Roles and responsibilities of Advisory Council should be more clearly defined (CCEEB); purpose of Advisory Council should be more lofty and of broader scope and should at least be to provide direct input into the Governing Board&#146;s decision-making process by reflecting the diversity of opinion of the advisory group level (County Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County and County Sanitation Districts of Orange County).

<P><li>The City of Los Angeles indicates it most significant comment concerns the process.  The City &quot;strongly suggests that the Administrative Committee hold a series of open forums to allow a greater opportunity for interested and affected stakeholders to meet to discuss the purpose of each of the advisory groups and the structure and function of the Advisory Council.&quot;  In addition, the City comments include:  
<BR>(a) better define the purpose, composition, timing, and authorities of the Advisory
  Council before it is created; 
<BR>(b) &quot;very concerned about the size of the proposed Advisory Council;&quot; 
<BR>(c) object to consolidation of IAIC, IAIC TAC and the Local Government &amp; Small 
  Business Assistance Committee; 
<BR>(d) the composition and role of the AQMP group is unclear; and 
<BR>(e) membership review should be conducted to ensure active and appropriate 
  membership (rather than automatically including existing members on the 
  re-organized groups). </ul>
<P>The Administrative Committee considered all comments and incorporated some into the recommendations set forth herein.
<P><B>Proposal</B>
<P>Rename certain existing advisory committees/task forces as consolidated Advisory Groups (see below); establish the composition of the ADVISORY COUNCIL and terms of its members (to include representatives from each Advisory Group); and define the responsibilities of the ADVISORY COUNCIL.  The Advisory Groups to be established are: 
<P><ul><li><B>Local Government &amp; Small Business Assistance Advisory Group</B> 
(formerly the IAIC, the IAIC-TAC, and the Local Government &amp; 
Small Business Assistance Committee);

<P><li><B>Ethnic Community Advisory Group</B>
(formerly the Ethnic Community Advisory Council);

<P><li><B>Scientific, Technical &amp; Modeling Peer Review Advisory Group</B> 
 (formerly the Modeling Working Group and Socioeconomic Technical 
 Review Committee);

<P><li><B>Air Quality Management Plan Advisory Group</B>;

<P><li><B>Technology Advancement Advisory Group</B> 
 (formerly the Technology Advancement External Review Group); and

<P><li><B>Home Rule Advisory Group </B>(formerly the Home Rule Working Group).
</ul>
<P>An interim charter for each Advisory Group is an attachment to the Resolution.  In response to several comments received, the Administrative Committee requested staff to return to the December 20, 1996 Administrative Committee meeting with expanded charters for each Advisory Group to better define the purpose and responsibilities of each.
<P>The membership of the above-specified Advisory Groups shall generally consist of the present membership of the committee or group being renamed, although some adjustments may be needed.  Members should have expertise to provide in-depth analysis of:
<P><ol><li> economic and business issues, 
<li> health and environmental issues, 
<li> technical and engineering issues, and 
<li>community impacts. </ol> 
<P>A roster of membership of current advisory groups, panels, task forces, and committees 
<BR>is provided as Attachment B.  In addition, various additional groups have been established to work on specific projects.  These groups have provided liaison with affected 
<BR>individuals and businesses.  A comprehensive summary of the existing groups, including standing Governing Board Committees, is provided as Attachment C.  
<P>Those groups related to the AQMP will dissolve upon adoption of the AQMP with new groups to be convened when appropriate.  The Administrative Committee will review the current membership of the Advisory Groups and other existing Board-established committees/panels/working groups/task forces and return to the Governing Board with recommendations (a) for adjustments to increase or decrease membership of any group as necessary or appropriate for the efficient, cost-effective operation of these groups, and (b) regarding periodic review of membership.
<P>The ADVISORY COUNCIL shall consist of approximately 31 members (depending on the number of Advisory Groups in existence at any given time) representing a cross-section of the community served by AQMD and who demonstrate aptitude and skill to further the AQMD&#146;s mission of continued progress toward achieving air quality standards while sensitive to the economic viability of the Basin, appointed as follows:  
<P><ul><li>three members from each Advisory Group, appointed by the Chairman of the Governing Board; 
<li>one at-large appointee by each Governing Board member for a total of 12; and 
<li>one Governing Board member who will
<BR>(a) be an <I>ex officio</I>, non-voting member of the ADVISORY COUNCIL; 
<BR>(b) serve as Chair of the Advisory Council to conduct the meetings;
<BR>(c) provide liaison with the Governing Board, and may address the Governing Board at its regular meeting regarding the activities of the ADVISORY COUNCIL.  The Chairman of the Board shall designate the <I>ex officio</I> member. </ul>
<P>To provide continuity of membership, upon initiation of this policy one-half of the appointees shall be for one term of two years and one-half shall be for one term of four years, as drawn by lot.  This provision does not apply to the <I>ex officio</I> member.  Thereafter, appointments will be for a four-year term.  The Chairman of the Board may remove an Advisory Group member at any time for lack of participation, misconduct, or a conflict of interest.
<P>ADVISORY COUNCIL members appointed pursuant to this policy serve without compensation, except for reimbursement of mileage and parking expenses incurred in connection with attendance at ADVISORY COUNCIL meetings. [ Those members of the IAIC, the IAIC-TAC, and the Ethnic Community Advisory Council who presently receive compensation of per diem of $100 plus travel allowance for mileage and parking shall continue to receive such compensation through June 30, 1997 and effective July 1, 1997 shall serve without compensation.]   The Chairman of the Board may approve additional expenses (such as for travel) on an as-needed basis upon an advance showing of the necessity of incurring such expense.
<P>The purpose of the ADVISORY COUNCIL is to facilitate communication between designated Governing Board Advisory Groups, to facilitate input into the Governing Board&#146;s decision-making process by reflecting the diversity of opinion of the Advisory Groups, and to participate in the AQMD&#146;s annual summit.   
<P>The ADVISORY COUNCIL shall meet at least monthly and shall, quarterly, provide concise written reports to the Governing Board summarizing its activities and shall, twice yearly, meet with the Governing Board to discuss Council activities and goals.  AQMD staff shall provide secretarial support to the ADVISORY COUNCIL to help prepare the necessary reports and provide administrative assistance.
<P>All ADVISORY COUNCIL meetings are open to the public and are subject to the Brown Act.  Any Governing Board member or Advisory Group member may attend and participate in any ADVISORY COUNCIL meeting.  
<P>This proposal is not intended to limit or constrain the efforts of the various implementation groups/committees which staff may, from time to time, establish to seek participation and consensus in addressing AQMD actions or proposals which may affect the citizens and organizations AQMD serves.

<br><p><br>

<P><b>Proposal:</b>
<blockquote>Amend Conflict of Interest Code of the 
 South Coast Air Quality Management District</blockquote>

<P><b>Synopsis:</b>

<blockquote>The Political Reform Act requires the AQMD to review its Conflict of Interest Code biennially and submit notice to the Board regarding its accuracy or the need to amend to reflect the addition, reclassification, renaming, or deletion of designated positions.  As a result of personnel changes during the past two years, the Code must now be amended.  Individuals holding designated positions are required to disclose certain investments, income, interests in real property, business entities, and business positions and also may have to disqualify themselves from making or participating in the making of governmental decisions affecting those interests.
</blockquote>

<P><b>Committee:</b>
<blockquote>Not Applicable.</blockquote>
<p><b>Recommended Action:</b>
<blockquote>Amend Exhibit &quot;A&quot; of the District&#146;s Conflict of Interest Code as reflected in the attached exhibit; and direct the Executive Officer to forward the amendment to the Fair Political Practices Commission for its review and approval.</blockquote>
<P>James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<BR>Executive Officer
<P><hr>
<P><B>Background</B>
<P>The District&#146;s Conflict of Interest Code must be amended to reflect changes by deleting, renaming and adding new classification designations.  Individuals holding specified positions are required to disclose certain investments, income, interest in real property, business entities, and business positions.  These individuals must also comply with the conflict of interest provisions of the Political Reform Act, and thus may have to disqualify themselves from making, or participating in the making of governmental decisions affecting those interests.
<P>As a result of changes in District positions over the past two years, the code must now be amended to reflect the deletion of the classifications of Engineering Systems Manager, Laboratory Services Manager, Operations Service Manager, Records Manager and Section Chief, the renaming of the classifications of Accounting Manager, Case Disposition Investigator, Clean Fuels Program Manager, Planning Manager, Principal Case Disposition Investigator and Senior Case Disposition Investigator to Controller, Investigator, Clean Fuels Officer, Planning &amp; Rules Manager, Investigations Manager, Supervising Investigator respectively, and by adding the classifications of Air Quality Analysis and Compliance Supervisor, Graphic Arts Manager, Plant Engineer &amp; Resource Planning Manager, as employees who must file the statement of Economic Interest pursuant to the code.  The substantive requirements of the Conflict of Interest Code remain unchanged.
<P>Before the District may amend its Code, the Fair Political Practices Commission requires that individuals whose positions will be subject to its requirement be afforded a written comment period or a public hearing.  Accordingly, a 45-day written comment period was provided to give interested individuals an opportunity to discuss the proposed amendments to the Code.

BOARD MEETING DATE:  December 13, 1996 AGENDA NO. 8 </b></center><BR><P><BR>
<P><b>Proposal:</b><blockquote>Amend Contract for 
  Employee Relations Litigation and Negotiation Services</blockquote>
<P><b>Synopsis:</b><blockquote>This recommendation is to amend the Goldstein, Kennedy &amp; Petito contract to add an amount not to exceed $200,000 to cover extraordinary litigation expenses involving ongoing lawsuits, legal challenges relating to the June 30, 1994, layoffs and reductions in classifications and contract negotiations.</blockquote>
<P><b>Committee:</b><blockquote>Administrative, November 22, 1996, Recommended for Approval</blockquote>
<P><b>Recommended Action</b>
<P><OL><LI>Appropriate $200,000 from the Undesignated Fund Balance to the District General, Services and Supplies Major Object, Professional and Special Service Account designated for Employee Relations Litigation. 
<P><LI>Authorize the Chairman to execute an amendment to the contract with the law firm of Goldstein, Kennedy &amp; Petito adding an amount not to exceed $200,000.
</OL>
<P> James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<br> Executive Officer
<P><hr>
<P><B>Background</B>
<P>The AQMD&#146;s three-year employee relations legal services contract reflected an expectation that costs would likely be highest during the contract&#146;s first year.  Much of the costly counsel-intensive activity that has occurred since the beginning of this fiscal year was unanticipated.  To reduce costs associated with the legal services, AQMD has shifted some of the cases to AQMD staff attorneys.  This action has saved the AQMD approximately $75,000 in outside legal services.  As AQMD attorneys become more experienced in employee relations legal services, staff expects to reduce the level of reliance on outside legal services; however, because of the legal complexity of the employee relations field, AQMD will continue to rely on outside employee relations legal services for the most complex cases and activities. 
<P>However,  extraordinary litigation activity relating primarily to (1) ongoing lawsuits, (2) legal challenges to the AQMD relating to the June 30, 1994, layoffs and reductions in classification that attempt to reverse these actions, (3) pending arbitration hearings regarding layoffs and reductions, and (4) ongoing labor negotiations with two unions, have resulted in increased costs.  These costs have been high because of the need for aggressively litigating these matters to defend the AQMD against very costly consequences. 
<P><B>Resource Impacts</B>
<P>There is available in the Undesignated Fund Balance $200,000 which can be appropriated to the District General Professional and Special Services Account for the purpose of amending the contract with the Goldstein, Kennedy &amp; Petito law firm by an amount not to exceed $200,000 to cover extraordinary litigation expenses.  Since this litigation may not be concluded by the end of this fiscal year, any amount that remains will be carried forward to next fiscal year.

<P><B>Proposal:</B><blockquote>Amend Four Contracts to Continue the Peer Review Process and  Enhance Socioeconomic Impact Assessments</blockquote>
<P><B>Synopsis:</B><blockquote>To further enhance the AQMD&#146;s socioeconomic analysis, several existing  contracts should be amended to provide for peer review and expert advice; development of labor force participation rates by ethnicity; refined  sub-county socioeconomic impact analyses through internal and external  databases; continued incorporation of local socioeconomic data; and sensitivity analyses of various policy scenarios.  The total of the proposed  amendments is $90,000.  Sufficient funds are in the FY 1996-97 budget.</blockquote>
<P><B>Committee:</B><blockquote>Administrative, November 22, 1996, Recommended for Approval</blockquote>
<P><B>Recommended Action:</B>
<blockquote>Authorize the Chairman of the Board to execute an amendment to contract with:
<P>1. Regional Economic Models, Inc. (REMI) in an additional amount not to exceed $30,000 to  develop population and labor force projections by ethnicity in the REMI model and attend the Socioeconomic Technical Review Committee (SETRC) meetings (total contract not to exceed  $80,000);
<P>2. The Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy (CCSCE) in an additional amount not to exceed $10,000 to provide information on local economic profiles and attend the SETRC  meetings(total contract not to exceed $95,000);
<P>3. Sonoma Technology, Inc. (STI) in an additional amount not to exceed $30,000 to develop a  geographic display of socioeconomic, air quality, and health effect data and additional features  relative to sensitivity analyses (total contract not to exceed $198,780;
<P>4. Professor Paul Ong at UCLA in an additional amount not to exceed $20,000 to examine the employment trend of regulated firms and attend the SETRC meetings (total contract not to  exceed $70,000).</blockquote>
<P>James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<BR>Executive Officer
<P><hr>
<P><B>Background</B>
<P>In response to a recommendation in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology&#146;s (MIT) audit of the AQMD&#146;s socioeconomic assessments, the AQMD has set up a Socioeconomic Technical Review Committee (SETRC) to regularly review and comment on the findings of the assessments.  Over the years, the AQMD has made a number of improvements in assessing socioeconomic impacts of its regulations.  For the 1997 Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP), the AQMD has expanded cost and benefit assessments to include distributional impacts at the sub-county level through the use of Census information, emission databases, and air quality modeling results.  Comments received on the 1997 AQMP socioeconomic analysis indicated the public&#146;s desire for additional refinements and detailed geographic analysis in order to further advance consideration of potential socioeconomic impacts.
<P><B>Proposal</B>
<P>The SETRC meets approximately three times a year to assist the AQMD in implementing the recommendations from the MIT audit of the AQMD&#146;s socioeconomic assessments.  The SETRC is comprised of experts in socioeconomic impact assessments, the regulated community, and representatives from other interested organizations.  The proposed contract amendments will provide funding for the attendance at the SETRC meetings for representatives from REMI, CCSCE and Professor Paul Ong, and for the following improvements in socioeconomic assessments:
<P>(1)   The availability of economic data and recent advancements in economic literature have made it possible to examine individual behavior in the labor market by race, gender, and age.  Incorporation of such differences in behavioral responses in the REMI model will allow the AQMD to more accurately assess impacts of air quality regulations on Whites, Hispanics, African-Americans, Asians and others in terms of population, migration, and employment.  The proposed refinement in the REMI model was discussed at the July 11, 1996 SETRC meeting.  Members of the SETRC agreed that the proposed refinement should be carried out.
<P>(2) Last spring, the AQMD contracted with STI to refine the Regional Human Exposure (REHEX) model to include the economic assessment of avoided health effects resulting from cleaner air.  The AQMD also worked with STI to include population projections by age cohort, gender, and ethnicity to better account for health effects on sub-populations.  The proposed contract amendment with STI will fund work to enable further refinement of the REHEX model to provide geographic displays of socioeconomic, air quality, and health effect data.  The refinement will assist the AQMD in better evaluating the modeling results.  Additional features will also be added  to the REHEX model to provide for testing of various policy scenarios.
<P>(3) Existing published information provides aggregate employment data at the county level.  Employment data at the firm level exist but are not published in order to preserve the confidentiality of each individual firm.  Professor Paul Ong has recently worked with the Economic Development Department (EDD) to gain access to the data for individual firms.  The proposed contract amendment will support Professor Ong&#146;s effort in analyzing the employment trend at the sub-county level of firms which have been regulated by the AQMD.  The contract amendment will also enable Professor Ong to further examine a number of underlying factors associated with the aforementioned employment trend.
<P>(4) Health and Safety Code Section 40460 requires that the AQMD use regional demographic and employment projections, prepared by the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG), to project future emissions.  Since 1993, the CCSCE has been providing necessary national and local economic data to assist the AQMD in re-aligning the REMI baseline forecast to ensure its consistency with the SCAG forecast.  The proposed contract amendment ensures that funding will be available to enable the CCSCE to continue to provide such services in the future.
<P><B>Sole Source Justification</B>
<P>Section II, Step 3 (C) of the Consultant Selection Policy and Procedure identifies four provisions under which a sole-source award may be justified: (1) cost to prepare documents exceeds cost for consultant, (2) delay would result in the endangerment of public health, (3) services are only available from sole source, and (4) other circumstances exist identifying sole source as in the best interests of the AQMD.  This request for sole-source awards is made under provision (3).
<P>The proposed refinements relating to the REMI and REHEX models will require that the structure of those models be revised.  Regional Economic Models, Inc. is the only vendor able to service the REMI model.  Sonoma Technology, Inc. is the only vendor able to service the REHEX model.
<P>The proposed employment trend analysis of regulated firms requires geo-coding of each firm regulated by the AQMD, which Professor Ong has already completed for the Socioeconomic Report of the 1997 AQMP.  Professor Ong has also secured access to the EDD employment database which is proprietary and is required for the proposed refinement.  Professor Ong is the only individual currently working on studies of this nature and the only one with secured access to the databases.
<P>The proposed action on continued incorporation of local economic data into the REMI model will require knowledge of the basic structure of the REMI and SCAG models.  The CCSCE, a leading forecaster in California, has extensive knowledge of growth trends and has worked on the REMI and SCAG models.  State law requires that the AQMD use SCAG data for projection purposes.  Using the same primary contractor as SCAG assures the data will be consistent.
<P><B>Resource Impacts</B>
<P>The total cost of the proposed amendments is $90,000 which is available in the FY 1996-97 budget.

<P><B>F</B><B>RIDAY, DECEMBER 6, 1996 AND </B><B>F</B><B>RIDAY, DECEMBER 13, 1996</B>
<P>Notice having been duly given, a meeting of a Committee of the South Coast Air Quality Management District Board was held at Palm Desert City Hall, 73-510 Fred Waring Drive, Palm Desert, California, and the regular meeting of the South Coast Air Quality Management District Board was held at District Headquarters, 21865 E. Copley Drive, Diamond Bar, California.  Members present on December 6, 1996:
<UL>Supervisor Jon D. Mikels, Chairman
<BR>County of San Bernardino
<P>Supervisor James W. Silva
<BR>County of Orange
<P>Supervisor S. Roy Wilson, Ed.D.
<BR>County of Riverside</UL>
<P> Chairman Mikels called the meeting to order at 10:00 a.m. and announced that because there was not a quorum of Board members present, the public hearing on the Coachella Valley PM10 Plan would be continued to the Board&#146;s regular meeting on December 13, 1996 for consideration and action by the full Board.  The public hearing would be opened, the Committee would hear public testimony, and a transcript would be provided to the Board members not present for their review prior to the December 13, 1996 meeting.
<P><B><U>PUBLIC HEARING</U></B>
<P><B>Note:  A transcript of the public hearing on the Coachella Valley PM10 Attainment Redesignation Request </B><B>and Maintenance Plan has been prepared and a copy is available for public review in the AQMD Library.  </B><B>Following is a </B><B><I>summary</I></B><B> of the proceedings.</B>
<P><OL><LI> Adopt Coachella Valley PM10 Attainment Redesignation Request and Maintenance Plan and Certify the Final Environmental Impact Report
<P> Melvin Zeldin, Director of Planning, gave the staff report.  The public hearing was opened, and the Committee heard testimony from the following individuals:
<P><U>JOHN BILLHEIMER, Consultant</U>
<BR> Commented that in many respects the Coachella Valley PM10 Plan would be the model for a similar effort in the coastal basin; however, there are differences which will make it a much more difficult task for the basin.
<P><U>DR. EMILY NELSON, Consultant, Coachella Valley PM10 Technical Working Group</U>
<BR> Suggested that:  (i) because of turnover resulting from public elections, there needs to be ongoing education of local staff and elected officials regarding maintenance of the PM10 standard in the Coachella Valley;  and (ii) there needs to be better education and outreach to the public regarding the public health problems related to PM10 and behavior modification on extreme natural days when the natural dust occurrence is so extreme that it cannot be controlled with street sweepers.
<P><U>JERRY MECHANIC, Coachella Valley Association of Governments</U>
<BR> Expressed CVAG&#146;s endorsement of the proposed maintenance plan and thanked everyone who worked hard to make the Coachella Valley PM10 attainment program successful.
<P><U>ED TIVITY, Building Industry Association Desert Chapter</U>
<BR> Expressed appreciation to AQMD staff for working cooperatively with the people of Coachella Valley to make PM10 attainment possible.
<P> There being no further testimony, the Committee continued the public hearing on the Coachella Valley PM10 Plan to the December 13, 1996 Board meeting.</UL>
<P>Members present on December 13, 1996:
<UL>Supervisor Jon D. Mikels, Chairman
<BR>County of San Bernardino
<P>Dr. William Burke, Vice Chairman
<BR>Speaker of the Assembly Appointee
<P>Mayor Michael D. Antonovich
<BR>County of Los Angeles
<P>Councilman Marvin Braude
<BR>Cities of Los Angeles County - Western Region
<P>Cody G. Cluff
<BR>Governor's Appointee
<P>Mayor Candace Haggard
<BR>Cities of Orange County

<BR>County of Orange
<P>Councilwoman Nell Soto
<BR>Cities of Los Angeles County - Eastern Region
<P>Supervisor S. Roy Wilson, Ed.D.
<BR>County of Riverside</UL>
<P> The meeting was called to order at 9:38 a.m. by Chairman Mikels.
<P> Chairman Mikels administered the oath of office to Mr. Cody G. Cluff, who was appointed by Governor Pete Wilson to fill the unexpired term of Hugh Hewitt, ending January 15, 1999.
<P>&#149; Opening Comments
<P> <U>Dr. Burke.</U>  Referred to a December 13, 1996 article in the <U>Los Angeles Times</U> newspaper concerning a proposed expansion of the Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), and commented that he raised questions relating to the FIP and LAX at the November 15, 1996 Board meeting.  Requested that Chairman Mikels consider establishing a committee to examine representations made to AQMD on behalf of the LAX approximately one year ago and determine whether or not those representations are proceeding and are in tandem with the proposed plans for expansion.  Chairman Mikels indicated that he would have that officially accomplished by the next Board meeting.
<P> <U>James M. Lents, Ph.D., Executive Officer</U>.  Briefed the Board on the new federal air quality standards that are being proposed by the U.S. EPA, including a PM2.5 standard.
<P>(Mr. Braude arrived at 9:50 a.m.)
<P>&#149; Demonstration of Web-Actuated Request for Permits
<P> Vinita Mathur, Director of Information Management, gave a brief demonstration of AQMD&#146;s new Web-Actuated Request for Permits (WARP) system which provides a way to apply for an AQMD Permit to Operate for selected types of equipment over the World Wide Web.
<P>(Mr. Antonovich arrived at 10:08 a.m.)
<P>&#149; Status Report on AQMD Local Implementation Efforts Regarding Title III, The Federal Air Toxics Program
<P> Pat Leyden, DEO of Stationary Source Compliance, gave a brief report to the Board.  The Home Rule Working Group, co-chaired by Dr. Wilson and Ms. Soto, has joined with CARB and the California Air Pollution Control Officers Association (CAPCOA), and jointly agreed upon five basic principles--the California Coalition Principles for Program Approval--that:  1) Program approval would provide exactly the same, if not better, environmental benefits; and cover the same sources and the same products;  2) A practical approach to enforcement is needed;  3) State or local agencies need the ability to significantly streamline the monitoring and recordkeeping and reporting in the federal requirements;  4)State or local agencies want the authority to make minor adjustments, including the approval of minor changes to test methods;  and 5) State and local agencies want U.S. EPA to commit to streamlining the process for local program approval.  A joint letter dated December 4, 1996 was submitted by Michael P. Kenny, ARB Executive Officer, and Mark Boese, CAPCOA President, to Felicia Marcus U.S. EPA Region IX Administrator, asking for EPA to consider a streamlined approach to program approval.  The attachment to that letter lays out the five principles in greater detail and includes signatures from the six major air districts in California, along with signatures from most of the major industrial organizations in California and one of the major labor groups.  Staff expects to be back before the Board in February or March of 1997 with the results of progress with EPA to streamline local program approval.

<P><LI><U>Items Deferred from Consent Calendar</U>
<P>5. Reorganize the Advisory Council
<P> Ms. Soto commented that she hoped the reorganization of the Advisory Council and consolidation of the various advisory groups would not stymie the discussion and interchange that members of the Ethnic Advisory Council have had with staff; and that their concerns, if any, and recommendations are brought to the Board.
<P> Mr. Loveridge offered two suggestions:  (i) that once a year, the Administrative Committee conduct a performance review of the Advisory Groups, and once every other year have a performance audit conducted by an outside group;  and (ii) that attendance rules be established for members of the Advisory Groups.
<P> Expressing concern that the reorganization of the Advisory Council as proposed provides the Chairman of the Governing Board too much control, Mr. Silva suggested the following alternative membership size and appointment policy for the Advisory Council:
<P>&#149; two members from each Advisory Group, appointed by the advisory groups;
<BR>&#149; one at-large appointee by each Governing Board member for a total of 12; and
<BR>&#149; two members appointed by the Governing Board Chairman.
<P> Mr. Braude asked that the suggestions by Mr. Loveridge and Mr. Silva be referred to the Administrative Committee for review and brought back to the Board for consideration at a later date.

<P><UL><UL>MR. LOVERIDGE MOVED APPROVAL OF AGENDA ITEM NO. 5 AS RECOMMENDED BY STAFF.  THE MOTION WAS SECONDED BY MR. BRAUDE, AND PASSED BY A UNANIMOUS VOTE OF THE BOARD.</UL></UL>
<P>8. Employee Relations Litigation
<P> Ms. Soto commented that she would be voting no on this item because this is the third or fourth time since she has been on the Board that the amount has been increased for this firm (Goldstein, Kennedy &amp; Petito) to defend AQMD against its own employees, which is something about which she has great trepidation.
<P> Speaking in support of the recommendation, Mr. Paulitz commented that as he understands it, there are presently more than the usual amount of cases.  He pointed out that AQMD has no control over who sues the agency, and that AQMD can either give in and pay off those suing the AQMD or pay legal fees to defend itself.
<P><UL><UL>MR. BRAUDE MOVED APPROVAL OF AGENDA ITEM NO. 8 AS RECOMMENDED.  THE MOTION WAS SECONDED BY MR. LOVERIDGE, AND PASSED BY THE FOLLOWING VOTE:

<P><OL START=29><LI> Adopt the Coachella Valley PM10 Attainment Redesignation Request and Maintenance Plan and Certify the Final Environmental Impact Report  <I>(Continued from December 6, 1996)</I>
<P> Melvin Zeldin, Director of Planning, reported that a public hearing was held on this item on December 6, 1996 in Palm Desert, California.  Board Members Mikels, Silva and Wilson, sitting as a Committee of the Board, opened the public hearing, heard testimony from the public, and continued the hearing to the December 13 Board meeting.  A transcript of the December 6 public hearing was prepared, and copies of the transcript were provided to each of the Board members not present on December 6, 1996.
<P> The public hearing was opened, and the Board heard testimony from the following individual:
<P><U>JOHN BILLHEIMER, Consultant</U>
<BR> Speaking in support of the staff recommendation, raised the question of whether or not the PM10 control measures that were done successfully in the Coachella Valley could be transferred to the coastal basin; and suggested that the AQMD consider that as Proposed 
<BR>Rule 1186 (PM10 Emissions from Paved and Unpaved Roads and Livestock Operations) comes before the Board within the next few months.  (Submitted Written Comments)
<P> There being no further public testimony, the public hearing was closed.
<P> Dr. Wilson complimented AQMD staff and the people representing all of the governments, business and industries in the Coachella Valley area for working together cooperatively which resulted in PM10 attainment for Coachella Valley.
<P><UL><UL>DR. WILSON MOVED ADOPTION OF RESOLUTION NO. 96-25, ADOPTING THE COACHELLA VALLEY PM10 ATTAINMENT REDESIGNATION REQUEST AND MAINTENANCE PLAN AND CERTIFYING THE FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT, AS RECOMMENDED BY STAFF.  THE MOTION WAS SECONDED BY DR. BURKE, AND PASSED BY THE FOLLOWING VOTE:
<P>AYES: Antonovich, Burke, Haggard, Lee, Loveridge, Mikels, Paulitz, Silva, Soto and Wilson.
<P>NOES: None.
<P>ABSTAIN: Cluff.
<P>ABSENT: Braude.</UL></UL></UL>
<P><OL START=30><LI> Amend Rule 1130.1 - Screen Printing Operations
<P> Fred Lettice, Senior Manager/Stationary Source Compliance, gave the staff report.  The public hearing was opened, and the Board heard testimony from the following individuals:
<P><U>JOHN BILLHEIMER, Consultant</U>
<BR> Supported the proposed adjustment of VOC limits, but expressed concern that the proposed amendments relating to optional control equipment under Subparagraph (d) created an inequity between operators who complied with the VOC limits through &quot;formulation&quot; and those who complied by reducing overall VOC emissions through the use of add-on control equipment.  He suggested that Subparagraph (d) be held for further study.  (Submitted Written Comments)
<P><U>JOHN GLASER, Artisan Screen Process</U>
<BR> Expressed support for the proposed amended rule, particularly the special category for containers and the corresponding 800 grams-per-liter VOC content limit.
<P> There being no further testimony, the public hearing was closed.
<P><U>Written Comments Submitted by:</U><U> </U><U> </U>
<BR>Scott Whitehouse, Colortone Gaming Press
<P><UL><UL>MR. LOVERIDGE MOVED ADOPTION OF RESOLUTION NO. 96-26, AMENDING RULE 1130.1 AND CERTIFYING THE FINAL SUBSEQUENT ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT, AS RECOMMENDED BY STAFF.  THE MOTION WAS SECONDED BY MR. BRAUDE AND PASSED BY A UNANIMOUS VOTE OF THE BOARD MEMBERS PRESENT (Absent:  Antonovich).</UL></UL></UL>
<P><OL START =31><LI> Amend Rule 1124 - Aerospace Assembly and Component Manufacturing Operations
<P> Alene Taber, Planning &amp; Rules Manager/Stationary Source Compliance, gave the staff report; and noted the <B><I>Errata Sheet for Agenda Item 31</I></B>, copies of which were distributed to Board members and made available to the public.  The errata sheet contained changes to PAR 1124 with respect to the definitions and VOC limits for <I>Commercial Exterior Aerodynamic Structure Primer</I> (<U>changed to &quot;Low </U><U>Solids Corrosion Resistant Primer</U>&quot;), <I>Adhesive Bonding Primers</I>, and <I>Adhesion Promoter</I> (<U>consolidated into &quot;Adhesive Bonding Primers&quot; category</U>).
<P> The public hearing was opened, and the Board heard testimony from the following individuals:
<P><U>ALAN CULWELL, The Boeing Company</U>
<BR> Expressed support for PAR 1124 because the rule continues to be technology forcing, and the proposed time extensions are necessary to allow low-VOC materials to be developed and qualified.
<P><U>CURTIS COLEMAN, Attorney, on behalf of California Aerospace Environmental Association</U>
<BR> Expressed support for PAR 1124, and will continue to work with staff to try to resolve concerns the aerospace industry still have about several of the definitions in the rule.
<P><U>JERRY KRAIM, Kraim Environmental Engineering</U>
<BR> Expressed support of the proposed amendments, and commented that he met with staff regarding reservations he had about some of the proposed provisions and staff addressed and resolved his concerns.
<P> There being no further testimony, the public hearing was closed.
<P><UL><UL>MS. LEE MOVED ADOPTION OF RESOLUTION NO. 96-27, AMENDING RULE 1124 AND CERTIFYING THE FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT, AS RECOMMENDED BY STAFF, INCLUDING THE MODIFICATIONS TO THE DEFINITIONS AND VOC LIMITS FOR COMMERCIAL EXTERIOR AERODYNAMIC STRUCTURE PRIMER (CHANGED TO &quot;LOW SOLIDS CORROSION RESISTANT PRIMER&quot;), ADHESIVE BONDING PRIMERS, AND ADHESION PROMOTER (CONSOLIDATED INTO &quot;ADHESIVE BONDING PRIMERS&quot; CATEGORY) SET FORTH IN THE <B><I>ERRATA SHEET FOR </I></B><B><I>AGENDA ITEM 31</I></B>.  THE MOTION WAS SECONDED BY DR. WILSON, AND PASSED BY A UNANIMOUS VOTE OF THE BOARD MEMBERS PRESENT (Absent:  Antonovich, Braude and Silva).</UL></UL></UL>
<P><OL START=32><LI> Amend Rule 219 - Equipment not Requiring a Written Permit Pursuant to Regulation II
<P> Jack Broadbent, Assistant DEO/Stationary Source Compliance, gave the staff report; and noted that staff&#146;s recommendation on this item includes the following changes to PAR 219, set forth in an errata sheet which was distributed to the Board and made available to the public:
<P><B>Preamble</B>
<P><I>&quot;A written permit or registration shall not be required for the following equipment unless the </I><I>equipment, process material or air contaminant is subject to Regulation IX, or X, or </I><B><I><U>Rule 1401 </U></I></B><B><I><U>or the emission limitation requirements of the</U></I></B><I> state Air Toxic Control Measure (ATCM), or </I><I>the National Emission Standards For Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP), or unless the </I><I>Executive Officer determines that the equipment may not operate in compliance with all </I><I>applicable District Rules and Regulations</I><B><I><S>, or determines that the equipment has a potential to </S></I></B><B><I><S>emit an air contaminant which is listed in Rule 1401</S></I></B><I>.  Once the Executive Officer. . . .&quot;</I>
<P><B>Subparagraph (l)(18)</B>
<P><I>&quot;Control enclosures with an internal volume of eight cubic feet or less, provided that aerosol </I><I>cans</I><B><I><U>, </U></I></B><B><I><S>and</S></I></B><I> air brushes</I><B><I><U>, or hand work</U></I></B><I> are used exclusively.&quot;</I>
<P><B>Subparagraph (m)(1)(C)</B>
<P><I>&quot;Water based solutions of salts</I><B><I> </I></B><B><I><S>of</S></I></B><B><I><U> or</U></I></B><I> sodium hydroxide.&quot;</I>
<P> The public hearing was opened, and the Board heard testimony from the following individuals:
<P><U>RITA LOOF, RadTech International</U>
<BR> Speaking in opposition to PAR 219, expressed concerns regarding inaccuracies and inequities in the rule related to ultraviolet and electron beam (UV/EB) coatings.  Commented that the exemption should be expanded for UV/EB processes because these are low VOC processes and converting from a solvent based process to UV/EB represents a net emission reduction for the basin.
<P><U>CHARLES AARNI, Chevron Products Company</U>
<BR> Encouraged the Board to adopt PAR 219, but expressed the following concerns that Chevron would like to have addressed by AQMD staff:  (i) Subparagraph (n) of the rule exempts crude oil and natural gas production wells from AQMD permit requirements; however there are many wells in the basin that are drilled for purposes of subsurface mitigation and AQMD&#146;s past practice has been to exempt those wells--however the language in PAR 219 does not clearly state that those wells are exempt;  (ii) have ongoing discussions with AQMD staff negotiating the types of equipment that will ultimately be included on a RECLAIM facility permit and on a Title V Permit--especially as it applies to refineries.
<P> Mr. Broadbent responded that staff is aware of the concerns expressed by Mr. Aarni and plan to address those concerns in Rule 219 amendments that staff expects to propose to the Board in 1997.  Have also been working with RadTech International, and are supportive of incentivizing UV/EB technology and to the extent staff can work with AQMD permitting requirements to incentivize it, streamline and possibly eliminate the permit requirements, will do so.  However, in staff&#146;s analysis to date, there is conflicting information as staff has obtained information from other users of UV/EB equipment which has not been consistent with information that has been supplied by representatives of RadTech.  Therefore, staff needs more time to work with them and will address the issues raised by RadTech as part of the 1997 amendment process for Rule 219.
<P> There being no further testimony, the public hearing was closed.

<P><B><U>PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD - (Public Comment on Non-Agenda Items, Pursuant to Government Code </U></B><B><U>Section 54954.3)</U></B>
<P><UL> Mr. David Trowbridge addressed the Board to express concerns regarding the use of smoke and chemicals by film production companies and special effects companies near his residence in downtown Los Angeles.  He requested that the Board take action to protect him from further exposure to these chemicals, enforce all laws under the Board&#146;s jurisdiction concerning this health and safety issue, investigate and enforce all laws concerning the handling, labeling, and use of chemicals by special effects companies, and notify the public in the area of his residence of all potential health and safety hazards from exposure to smoke and pyrotechnic effects of filming.

<P><B>SYNOPSIS:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>State law requires the AQMD to prepare and submit annually to the state board a three-year budget forecast based upon existing programs and rules and new programs or rules to be adopted.  This is the seventh annual Three-Year Budget Forecast.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>COMMITTEE:</B><BLOCKQUOTE> Administrative, December 20, 1996, Recommended for Approval </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>Executive Officer
<P>
<HR><P><B>Background</B>
<P>At Board direction, the AQMD instituted a three-year budget forecast process beginning with FY 1990-91 based on the AQMP and new authorities derived from state and federal law.  In January, 1991 this process was formalized by the state with the addition of Health and Safety Code Section 40452 which requires the AQMD to annually forecast budget and staff increases proposed for the following FY and projected for the next two FYs.  Beginning in January, 1995, with the addition of Health and Safety Code Section 40721, the AQMD now is required to submit by February 1 of each year its three-year budget forecast to the state board for its review.
<P>Both regulated and voluntary emission reductions and actions to minimize fee increases on businesses have resulted in less revenues to support the clean air program.  Over the next three years, the AQMD will continue its efforts to reduce its budget as fee revenues decline through its commitment to the Regulatory Reform Initiatives, the implementation of market incentives, permit streamlining, source education, business assistance, and technology advancement.
<P>AQMD forecasts continued reductions in staffing through attrition, if possible, of approximately 4 percent annually along with reductions in contracting related to implementing Rule 2202.  Despite reductions in expenditures of approximately $7.5 million over the next three years, AQMD projects across-the-board CPI fee increases of 2.0% in FY 1997-98, 2.5% in FY 1998-99, and 2.5% in FY 1999-2000 and the use of $4 to 5 million annually from reserves to make up for revenue shortfalls.

<P><STRONG>SYNOPSIS: </STRONG>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This report highlights AQMD rulemaking activity for 1997 and beyond.  Upcoming public workshops are noted, both in the regular calendar and in a separate list at the end of the report.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>COMMITTEE:</STRONG>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Not applicable.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><BLOCKQUOTE>Receive and file the attached report.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>      James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<P>      Executive Officer
<P><HR>
<P>
<P><B>Background</B>
<P>AQMD is required by state law to publish a list of all rules potentially scheduled for consideration during the coming year.  Every January, the Rule Forecast Report is expanded for this purpose and to present a progress report to the Board.  The rule schedule for 1997 is demanding and places great emphasis on VOC and PM<SUB>10</SUB> reductions.  In order for the region to maintain emission reduction progress toward attainment and implement the AQMP, staff will be bringing about 25 control measures contained in the 1997 AQMP and approximately 21 rules for proposed amendment before the Board for action in 1997.
<P><B>Proposal</B>
<P>Several significant hearing items are scheduled to be brought before your Board in 1997.  Among the most critical are the following:
<P><U>Area Source Credits (CM# CMB-03 &amp; 04)</U>
<P>Proposed rule will implement the market incentives program for area sources to supplement RECLAIM.
<P><U>Intercredit Trading</U>
<P>AQMD is developing market incentive rules under the intercredit trading markets to broaden credit generation and use, and to maximize trading opportunities between stationary, area, and mobile sources.  The program objectives minimize compliance costs, and promote advancement and commercialization of air pollution control technologies.
<P><U>Title V Operating Permits</U>
<P>Regulation XXX was developed to establish the parameters for an operating permit program that satisfies the requirements of Title V of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.  On August 29, 1994, U.S. EPA proposed revisions to regulations that define the minimum elements of an approvable operating permit program.  These regulations are expected to be finalized in 1996.  Regulation XXX will then be amended to parallel changes in the EPA program.  In addition, changes are proposed to facilitate approval and clarify approvability.
<P><U>Fluid Catalytic Cracking Units (CM# CMB-09)</U>
<P>Proposed rule will reduce PM<SUB>10 </SUB>emissions from petroleum refinery fluid catalytic cracking units.
<P><U>Solvent Degreasers (CM# CTS-02N)</U>
<P>Proposed amendments are expected to reduce VOC emissions by 36.9 tons per day.  They will be based on aqueous cleaning technology in lieu of petroleum solvent usage.  Remote reservoir cleaning operations will be removed from this rule since they are subject to Rule 1171.
<P><U>Emission Reductions from Refinery Flares (CM# CMB - 07)</U>
<P>Proposed rule will take the first step of a two-step approach to potential flare emissions reduction by gathering data on flaring operations at petroleum refineries to assess the need for, or the level of, any future controls to reduce flare emissions.  This first step will require refineries to monitor flaring activities for the amount and composition of gases being flared.  If the data demonstrates a need to control flaring operations, step two of the rule will be to develop specific control requirements to reduce flare 
<BR>emissions.
<P><U>Title III Program &amp; Regulation XVIII</U>
<P>Regulation XVIII will establish the structure for &quot;Local Program Approval&quot; for all Title III rules, including equivalency coverage of:  emission sources, hazardous air pollutants, emission limits, and criteria for practical and enforceable monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting.  Other rules that may need to be amended include Rules 108, 109, 461, 462, 463, 464, 466, 477, 481, 1101, 1106, 1124, 1125, 1126, 1129, 1130, 1130.1, 1136, 1141, 1162, 1173, 1176, 1179, 1401, 1402, 1405, 1406, and 1420.
<P><B>Implementation Plan</B>
<P>Staff is committed to maintaining the proposed hearing dates established in the Rule Forecast Report to achieve the necessary emission reductions required by the AQMP.  Additional information on projected emission reductions will be included in the February Rule Forecast Report.

<P><B> </B><B> </B>Proposed amendments will take the first step of a two-step approach to reduce VOC emissions from organic liquid storage tanks by gathering data on storage tanks that are currently exempt from Rule 463 to assess the need for, or the level of, any future controls required to reduce VOC emissions from these tanks.  If the data demonstrates a need to reduce VOC emissions, step two of the rule will include identification of the appropriate control options.

<P>  Proposed rule will take the first step of a two-step approach to potential flare emissions reduction by gathering data on flaring operations at petroleum refineries to assess the need for, or the level of, any future controls to reduce flare emissions.  This first step will require refineries to monitor flaring activities for the amount and composition of gases being flared.  If the data demonstrates a need to control flaring operations, step two of the rule will be to develop specific control requirements to reduce flare emissions.

<P><B><U>SECTION I - PUBLIC ADVISOR ACTIVITIES</U></B>
<P>Staff participated in the following activities, programs and events listed below.  A statistical report of these activities also is included.
<P>Contact:  La Ronda V. Bowen, Public Advisor, 909.396.3235
<P><B>BUSINESS OUTREACH</B>
<P>AQMD INDUSTRY ROUNDTABLE MEETING - November 6, 1996 at the AQMD Headquarters in Diamond Bar.  Executive Officer James M. Lents, Ph.D., and AQMD staff met with nine members of the Industry Roundtable and provided the group with an overview of the Draft 1997 Update to the Air Quality Management Plan.
<P>BUSINESS &amp; PUBLIC POLICY CONFERENCE - AQMD staff facilitated the AQMD&#146;s co- sponsorship of the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce&#146;s 48th Annual Business &amp; Public Policy Conference on November 20, 1996 at the Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles.  The featured speakers at this year&#146;s conference included: Paul Hazen, Chairman of Wells Fargo &amp; Co.; Daniel E. Lungren, California&#146;s Attorney General; Gray Davis, Lieutenant Governor of California; Robert D. Hormats, Vice Chairman of Goldman Sachs (International); and Brit Hume, ABC Chief White House Correspondent.  AQMD staffed an information table during the conference.  Business outreach and assistance information was provided to conference attendees along with information on the health effects of smog.
<P>OUTREACH PLANNING FOR AUTOMOTIVE PARTS CLEANING OPERATIONS (RULE 1171) - AQMD staff met with representatives of Sanitation Districts, the California Department of Toxic Substances Control, and the Pollution Prevention Center to develop an outreach program to publicize the changes to Rule 1171 which require automotive parts cleaning operations to switch to water-based solvents by 1999.
<P>LA BREA TAR PIT PROJECT - AQMD staff facilitated a meeting between the management of the Page Museum and the director of the Pollution Prevention Center.  In the past, the Page Museum has used a vapor degreasing unit containing the solvent 1,1,1 TCA to remove tar from the specimens and soil collected from the La Brea Tar Pits.  At the request of the Public Advisor&#146;s Office, the Pollution Prevention Center will explore alternatives which use a water-based solvent for this purpose.  The dual goals of this project are to eliminate the use of 1,1,1 (TCA), which is an ozone depleting compound, and to eliminate the need for the Page Museum to operate a vapor degreasing unit which requires an AQMD permit.
<P>MEETING OF THE INDUSTRIAL ENVIRONMENTAL COALITION OF ORANGE COUNTY - In addition to a regulatory briefing provided by AQMD staff, Dr. Lents was  the keynote speaker at the luncheon meeting of this professional association.  Dr. Lents described the newly adopted AQMP and the future direction of air pollution control in this region.
<P><B>PUBLIC EDUCATION</B>
<P>SMOGBUSTERS CLUB - AQMD staff has facilitated an agreement with Clean Air Now to develop and produce an activity sheet featuring information on alternative sources of renewable energy for members of the AQMD&#146;s Smogbusters Club.  Clean Air Now is a nonprofit organization that works to educate and inform the public health and air quality issues.  Nearly 2,500 students have joined the AQMD&#146;s Smogbusters Club which promotes the voluntary reduction of air pollution through education and providing information through quarterly mailings of activity sheets, other materials and events students can participate in.
<P>OPEN AIRWAYS PROGRAM - AQMD staff facilitated the AQMD&#146;s co-sponsorship of the American Lung Association of Los Angeles County&#146;s Open Airways for Schools curriculum to be used this fall in Los Angeles area schools.  The goal of the program is to reduce student absenteeism and emergency room visits by helping students to control their asthma.  Packets of guides for instructors have been distributed to hospital nurses who visit elementary schools throughout the region.  AQMD staff has also made presentations on recent revisions to Regulation VII to several ALA in-service training meetings for nurses..
<P>VISITING DIGNITARIES - Three delegations representing a total of three countries visited AQMD&#146;s headquarters during the month of November: Armen Sagatelian, Ph.D., Environmental Center Director of the Academy of Sciences in Yerevan, Armenia, met Nov. 6 with Public Advisor and Transportation Planning staffs for a general overview and a tour; a six-member delegation led by Hsiaung-Wen Chen, Director of the Bureau of Air Quality Protection and Noise Control, Taiwan EPA, met Nov. 19 with Technology Advancement and Planning, Transportation and Information Management staff for an overview of alternative energies; and a delegation of provincial environmental bureaus from the People&#146;s Republic of China met Nov. 21 with Public Advisor staff for a general overview of AQMD&#146;s programs.

<P><B><U>SECTION III - SMALL BUSINESS ASSISTANCE ACTIVITIES</U></B>
<P>Highlights of the activities for November, specifically related to the Permit Assistance Centers and the Air Quality Assistance Fund (AQAF) loan guaranty program, are described below.  The statistical report of all staff activities is also included.  Please note that the format for the statistical report has taken on a new appearance which was initiated last month.  The intent is to make it clearer and more reflective of all office activities.
<P>Contact        Lee Lockie, Director, 909.396.2390
<P><B><U>PERMIT ASSISTANCE CENTER HIGHLIGHTS FOR NOVEMBER</U></B>
<P>The Small Business Assistance Office (SBAO) continued to staff the Centers at Downey, Van Nuys, Los Angeles City Hall, Palm Desert, Baldwin Hills-BRC, and Ontario on a part-time basis. The number of permit applications received by the AQMD from the areas surrounding these centers decreased during the month of November, as compared to October&#146;s statistics.  Our assistance requests decreased as well.  The chart below is a graphic representation of permit activities within a 3 &#189; mile radius of each center during the months of October and November.

<P><B><U>Gas Company-Energy Resource Center - Downey</U></B>
<P>Staff currently is in the process of finalizing the revisions and amendments to the memorandum of understanding between the Gas Company and AQMD.  This new MOU will reflect the current staff operating schedule and outline the types of services that are provided by SBAO staff.
<P>On November 20, 1996, Nola Oriola-Brown, AQAC Supervisor, and Mr. Al Baez, A.Q. Engineer, were guest speakers at a Gas Company sponsored workshop for small business owners.  Staff discussed compliance inspections methodologies, answered questions, and provided information on SBAO services and programs available to small businesses.  Approximately 60 businesses attended the event.  A number of businesses contacted us after the seminar to request on-site technical consultations.
<P><B><U>San Fernando Valley Permit Assistance Center</U></B>
<P>The Valley Economic Development Center (VEDC) launched a $126.5 million lending partnership which is part of their Business Assistance Program.  The VEDC is a one-stop small business center providing free consulting, training, and business assistance.  Our Air Quality Assistance Fund is recognized by this partnership as an additional financial resource available to small businesses to help offset the cost of air quality compliance.   Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, City Council members Alarcon, Chick, Feuer, and State Senator Rosenthal attended the event, as did AQMD SBAO staff.
<P>SBAO and Cal/EPA staff met with representatives of Singapore Aerospace International, Inc. Mr. Federiko Yap, Regional Manager and Mr. Ang Chye Kiat, Regional Director North America. The company is considering installation of an aircraft refinishing operation in the Valley or at the former Norton Air Force Base in San Bernardino.  The company could employ approximately 100 people at full operation.
<P><B><U>Orange County Permit Assistance Centers - Santa Ana and Lake Forest</U></B>
<P>This month the <B>Regional Agencies Round Table</B> met for the first time.  This committee is sponsored by Cal/EPA and is comprised of representatives from the following agencies:
<P>Cal/OSHA
<P>City of Lake Forest
<P>Count of Orange, Environmental Management Agency
<P>County of Orange Environmental Health Division
<P>County Sanitation Districts of Orange County
<P>Department of Fish and Game
<P>Department of Toxic Substances Control
<P>Los Alisos Water District
<P>Orange County Fire Authority
<P>Santa Ana Regional Water Quality Control Board
<P>SCAQMD
<P>U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
<P>This roundtable will convene every other Wednesday at Lake Forest City Hall to provide a one-stop permit coordination panel for Orange County businesses.   The panel also addresses such issues as permit streamlining, environmental cross-media training, and inter-agency permit screening. Association with this roundtable is beneficial for the overview it offers to the regulatory requirement processes of other agencies.  Additionally, addressing compliance issues and other agency requirements in this forum streamlines the process for companies. 
<P><B><U>Business Revitalization Center (BRC) - Baldwin Hills</U></B>
<P>The corner of Imperial Highway and Central Avenue is the proposed site for the development of the new Watts Gateway which includes new businesses and the modernization of existing businesses in South Central Los Angeles.  The JT Graves Company is the developer.  It plans to bring two new businesses, Home Base and a Denny&#146;s Restaurant, to a separate location at the corner of Central and Rosecrans in Compton.
<P>Staff is assisting the Office of Mayor Riordan and the Regional Water Quality Control Board to determine what environmental hazards exist in order to assist with the completion of this commercial endeavor.  This tract of land is the largest open and available tract of commercial land in Los Angeles.  Natalia Porche is the SBAO staff person working on this project.
<P><B><U>Los Angeles City Hall</U></B>
<P>SBAO is considering changing the staffing day for this center to the first Monday of every month, starting the first of next year.  Preliminary analysis shows Mondays to be the busiest day of the week at L.A. City Hall.
<P><B><U>Inland Empire Permit Assistance Center - Ontario</U></B>
<P>Activity generated from this center was moderate during November.
<P>Our Small Business Assistance Office is active in identifying companies that are candidates for pollution prevention measures.  SBAO staff encourage these businesses to use lower VOC coatings even when the rules do not require it.  
<P>In this regard, during November, Sherri Fairbanks, Staff Specialist and SBAO staff member assigned to this office, performed an on-site technical consultation at a small manufacturer that paints and silk-screens approximately 1,800 golf club shafts per day.  These shafts, made of graphite carbon, are painted to order in a variety of custom colors and may or may not be finished using a two component polyester resin topcoat.  Graphite carbon is a substrate that does not fall within the definition of any of the AQMD&#146;s coating rules.  Therefore, the company did not have to comply with any VOC requirements.  However, the company is voluntarily using coatings that are below the VOC limits specified in our Rules.  <B>Apache Golf of Yorba Linda</B> is spotlighted as noteworthy for its pollution prevention efforts.  We encouraged the owner to continue to use lower VOC products.

<P>  Roberta Rigg, EDBR, 909.396.2659.
<P><B>ACTIVITIES</B>
<P>Activities during this reporting period included participation in 2 Red Team meetings, one with a paper recycler (confidential), and a follow-up meeting with CPC International, and 1 community outreach project.  Assistance was provided to various facilities wanting to expand or consolidate their operations.  Companies were informed of emerging new pollution reduction technologies as well as technology transfer opportunities.  EDBR staff also participated in 1 public outreach meeting by making a presentation and providing information to interested parties.  The total number of participants reached through this meeting was 80 people.
<P> Open Items (business development and retention efforts in process)  27
<P> Completed Items (decision to stay, expand, etc.)     19
<P>  (This represents 3,548 jobs/jobs retained in California)
<P> Outreach and meetings with companies      2
<P><B>BAKING FACILITY (CONFIDENTIAL)</B>
<P>The owners of a large baking facility located in the Southland were contemplating relocating the operation to a vacant facility located in central California.  The motivation for the move was an estimated increase in annual profits of $2.3 million.  The move would have essentially terminated employment for 900 local baking personnel and had a significant impact on the surrounding community as most of the employees commuted.  The move would not have impacted an additional 1,100 employees associated with distribution and sales.  A Governor&#146;s Red Team was created to retain this important facility and the associated jobs including: Economic Development Corporation of Los Angeles County, City of Montebello, Southern California Edison, The Gas Company, Los Angeles County Sanitation District, State of California Trade and Commerce Agency, California Manufacturing Technology Center (CMTC), organized labor, management and EDBR staff.
<P>An action plan was developed to mitigate the annual operating cost differential between the local plant and the central California plant.  It was discovered that the local plant used inefficient equipment and operating practices.  It was determined that the services of CMTC should be retained to perform a study thoroughly analyzing the equipment, processes and practices used by the bakery and to make recommendations to improve efficiency and cost savings.  The cost of the CMTC study was estimated to be $20,000 of which $15,000 was cost-shared by the District.
<P>The City of Montebello and the facility cost-shared the remainder of the study.  The study&#146;s results determined that for an expenditure of approximately $650,000 the bakery could conservatively save $420,000 annually.  As a result, the bakery owners have decided to remain in southern California.
<P>AIRPLANE MANUFACTURER (CONFIDENTIAL)
<P>EDBR staff discussed a proposal advanced by a major airline for the construction and operation of an airplane painting facility in southern California.  Based on information supplied by the airline company, this could create an additional 600 jobs as they would shut down a similar facility in the midwest.  The decision, expected to be made in the very near future, now stands between a northern California location and a southern California location.

<P><b>Synopsis:</b><blockquote> The IAIC met November 21, 1996.  A summary and attendance record of that meeting is set forth below.

<P> Jon D. Mikels
<br> Chairman, IAIC
<P><hr>
<P>The meeting was called to order at 1:12 pm by IAIC Chairman Jon Mikels.
<P><B>Approval of September 26 and October 17, 1996, Minutes</B>
<P><I>On motion by Councilmember Judy Wright, and seconded by Councilmember Pat McGuigan, the </I><I>September 26 and October 17, 1996, meeting minutes were approved, as submitted.</I>
<P><B>Report by TAC Chairman on TAC Meeting</B>
<P>TAC Chair Greg Adams, representing the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts, reported that the TAC discussed the status of two items not included on the IAIC&#146;s agenda:  1) the Intercredit Trading Program; and 2) Proposed Amendments to Rule 1122 (Solvent Degreasers).  
<P><U>Intercredit Trading Program</U> -<U> </U>will provide an alternate method of complying with existing and future AQMD requirements by creating a structure of emissions credits that can be applied toward the emissions reductions required by a rule from which an entity is seeking relief.  The Program consists primarily of two parts:  1) Rule 2501, the Air Quality Investment Program; and 2) future intercredit trading rules.  At the TAC meeting staff provided a report on Rule 2501 and advised that a December 11 public workshop is scheduled to discuss the AQIP.  The workshop will review two key issues relating to toxics and banking.  In fact, staff is currently developing alternatives to the banking provisions.  The TAC also reported that ARB is simultaneously implementing Assembly Member Marilyn Brewer&#146;s AB 1777, the state equivalent to the Intercredit Trading Program.  ARB released draft language in mid-September and is expected to release revised language in the near future, following which the ARB will consider adoption in February 1997.  Finally, staff advised that EPA&#146;s open market trading guidance document will be available in early 1997.  Greg Adams provided an example of one innovative application which could result in emissions credits.  Specifically, a representative from the Las Virgenes Water District proposed an innovative concept using sewage digest gas funneled into a fuel cell which emits virtually no emissions and from which the heat generated could warm and cool buildings.  
<P><U>Proposed Amendments to Rule 1122 (Solvent Degreaers)</U> - the TAC discussed that this rule, when coupled with the recently-adopted Rule 1171 (Solvent Cleaning Operations) and Rule 1113 (Architectural Coatings), will result in greater emissions reductions than would have occurred if VOC RECLAIM had been adopted.  Although staff estimates that Rule 1122 will reduce 36 tons per day of VOC emissions, the AQMD&#146;s database only reflects 1.5 tons per day from permitted sources.  <B>RECOMMENDATION</B>: the TAC recommended that the inventory in Rule 1122 be refined to determine exactly what sources should be targeted if the rule is to be defensible and achieve its emissions reductions.  Rule 1122 is scheduled for public hearing in summer 1997.
<P><B>Update on REACH Task Force</B>
<P>The IAIC was provided an update on the efforts of the REACH Task Force by SCAG co-chair, Judy Wright.  Councilmember Wright reported that the Task Force has accepted recommendations similar to those contained in the 1997 AQMP.  Within the next three years the Task Force plans to move forward with a hot-lane demonstration project, focusing on emissions reductions and feasibility.  Several sites proposed by Caltrans are being considered at this time.
<P><B>Report on Proposed Amendments to 403 (Fugitive Dust) and Rule 1186 (PM10 Emissions from </B><B>Paved and Unpaved Roads and Livestock Operations)</B>
<P>The IAIC received a presentation by Dr. Julia Lester on proposed amendments to Rule 403 (Fugitive Dust) and Proposed Rule 1186 (PM10 Emissions from Paved and Unpaved Roads and Livestock Operations).  The purpose of the amendment and new rule is to adopt and implement Best Available Control Measures for fugitive dust sources in the South Coast Air Basin.  The IAIC was provided with an overview of the particulate matter problem for each region in the basin from both natural and manmade sources.  Dr. Lester also explained how ammonia nitrate and sulfate, secondary particles, bond with particulates to form PM10.
<P>Dr. Lester emphasized that unlike emissions from hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen which continue to decrease even without further controls, baseline emissions for particulate matter from fugitive dust continue to increase despite current controls.  In part, this is caused by: 1) increased construction activity as a result of an improving economy; and 2) more entrained road dust on freeways as a result of higher projected VMT in the future.  Thus, the BACM must not only reduce current levels but reduce that which will occur through regional growth.  This projection is based on a series of studies that were carried out which included testing local emission factors. 
<P>In providing background on the region&#146;s PM problem, Dr. Lester noted that the Basin, except Coachella Valley, is designated as a &quot;serious non-attainment&quot; area.  Coachella Valley, however, has achieved the federal PM10 standard for the last three years, and the Governing Board will be considering a PM10 Maintenance Plan for that area at a December 6, 1996 public hearing in Palm Desert.  The IAIC discussed how the Coachella Valley controlled fugitive dust and achieved the federal standard.  For instance, in 1994 the nine cities in the Coachella Valley and Riverside County adopted the most comprehensive local dust control ordinances in the nation.  
<P>Next, Dr. Lester reviewed the federal mandates for reducing PM10 and the proposed rule requirements, including contingency measures, to meet the BACM targets listed in the 1997 AQMP.  Because there has been considerable concern relative to the requirement in PR 1186 mandating PM10-efficient street sweepers for all future procurements by local governments after January 1999, an additional public workshop focusing on this issue has been scheduled inviting local governments, street sweeper operators, and street sweeper manufacturers and contractors to discuss and resolve any concerns with staff.  Finally, Dr. Lester reviewed emission reductions and cost-effectiveness for both rules.  She concluded by noting that a January 10, 1997 public hearing is scheduled for both PR 1186 and PAR 403.
<P>The IAIC also discussed the possibility of cities working together to comply with PM10 measures, and the question of whether AB 2766 funds can be used for PM10 projects (e.g., paving roads, purchasing street sweepers, dust suppression) was raised.  Councilmember Judy Wright commented that funding from other sources is necessary considering that garbage and clean cities programs are funded through city fees and the recently enacted AB 218 requires cities to obtain public authorization for fee increases.  <B>ACTION</B>: AQMD Public Advisor La Ronda Bowen agreed to find out whether AB 2766 funds may be used to comply with PM10 measures.  <B>RECOMMENDATION</B>:  Ron Hoffman, an IAIC-TAC member representing Los Angeles County/Department of Regional Planning, suggested that the issue of livable/clean cities communities be placed on a future IAIC (or other applicable committee) agenda.  This issue was incorporated as a resolution to the 1997 AQMP which called for the formation of a working group to see what reductions are possible through voluntary land-use techniques.  Councilmember Judy Wright commented that if local governments enforce land-use patterns such that they help comply rather than exacerbate the air quality problem, they should be given credit for such.
<P><B>Report on Local Government Outreach Activities</B>
<P>A representative from the San Gabriel Valley Council of Governments reported that a November 20 AB 2766 workshop was hosted by the COG in the City of Duarte.  At this workshop various issues were raised concerning problems cities have encountered when using AB 2766 funds.  These include inconsistency among cities in the administration of AB 2766 programs, problems with the auditing process, and difficulties in identifying funds allocated but not encumbered.  The San Gabriel Valley COG intends to develop a strategic expenditure plan for projects that could cross different jurisdictional lines and create a synergy between cities for spending AB 2766 funds.  La Ronda Bowen said that Public Advisor staff is working with ARB to improve the current reporting format cities use for AB 2766 funds.
<P><B>Monthly Progress Report on Public Advisor Office Activities</B>
<P>The agenda package included the Public Advisor's Monthly Activity Report ending October 1996 as well as the latest report on visiting dignitaries.  La Ronda Bowen reported that the Small Business Assistance Office continues to work with permit assistance centers.  In addition, Ms. Bowen announced that the AQMD Clean Technology Center is expected to open in early 1997.
<P><B>Update on AB 2766 Discretionary Fund Process</B>
<P>The Committee was provided the latest written report prepared for the Governing Board on the AB 2766 Discretionary Fund Process.
<P><B>Other Business</B>
<P>Greg Adams, TAC Chairman, reported on a recent meeting of the Home Rule Working Group, CAPCOA, and ARB Executive Officer Mike Kenny to discuss developing a programmatic approach to implementing the NESHAPS standards so that state and federal programs are compatible.  ARB wants to show that existing state programs can be deemed equivalent in emissions reductions to federal NESHAPS, but EPA Region IX is reluctant to take supportive action.  Mr. Kenny is requesting that Home Rule Working Group and CAPCOA members support a Statement of Principles to be submitted to EPA Region IX at a meeting in Los Angeles on December 6.  <B>RECOMMENDATION</B>:  The IAIC recommended that Chairman Mikels, on behalf of the IAIC, sign the joint letter being sent to Felicia Marcus supporting equivalency between the federal and state programs.  This joint letter is attached for information.
<P>Also under Other Business, Greg Adams reported that the TAC also discussed the dissolution of the IAIC and its TAC.  The TAC believes it is inappropriate for the IAIC and its TAC to be rolled into the proposed Local Government and Small Business Assistance Advisory Group.  The TAC believes it is inappropriate for policymakers to discuss all the technical issues; rather they should concentrate on the overall policy issues.  <B>RECOMMENDATION</B>:  The TAC believes that some form of a technical group should remain while including small business representatives.  Finally, the TAC believes that more discussion on the specifics should occur before a policy decision is made on committee reorganizations.  Chairman Mikels explained that this would be the last meeting of the IAIC as currently constituted.  He also reported that formation of the Local Government and Small Business Assistance Advisory Group resulted from recent state legislation to improve local government outreach.  Although the legislation did not pass, the Board is committed to addressing the issues raised in the legislation.  This issue will be discussed by the Administrative Committee in November and the full Governing Board on December 13, 1996.
<P><I>There being no public comment, the IAIC meeting adjourned at 3:02 p.m.</I>

<BLOCKQUOTE>  Mobile Source Air Pollution Reduction Review Committee and Approve Motor Vehicle Registration Fees Report to CARB for FY 1995-96 for the AB 2766 Discretionary Fund Portion</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>SYNOPSIS:</STRONG>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>Pursuant to Health &amp; Safety Code 44247, CARB is required to gather data on funding sources from all air districts with an annual budget exceeding $1 million.  The FY 1995-96 report to CARB includes AQMD&#146;s funding sources and data and analyses for the three segments of the AB 2766 Program.  Since submittal dates for each portion are different, this action requests the Board to approve the portion of the report covering the 30% discretionary segment of the AB 2766 Program.  On December 19, 1996, the MSRC unanimously agreed to forward to the Board for approval this segment of the report.  
<P>   Set forth below are a summary of key issues addressed at the MSRC&#146;s December 19, 1996, meeting at which the members met as a committee of the whole due to the lack of a quorum.  The MSRC&#146;s next meeting is Thursday, January 23, 1997, at 1:00 p.m. in Conference Room CC8.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>RECOMMENDED ACTION:</STRONG>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>Receive and file the attached report and approve the Motor Vehicle Registration Fees Report to CARB for FY 1995-96 for the AB 2766 Discretionary Fund Portion</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>Approve Motor Vehicle Registration Fees Report to CARB for FY 1995-96 for the AB </B><B>2766 Discretionary Fund Portion</B>
<P>Pursuant to Health &amp; Safety Code 44247, CARB is required to gather data on funding sources from all air districts with an annual budget exceeding $1 million.  The FY 1995-96 report to CARB includes AQMD&#146;s funding sources and data and analyses for the three segments of the AB 2766 Program.  Since submittal dates for each portion are different, this action requests the Board to approve the portion of the report covering the 30% discretionary segment of the AB 2766 Program.  
<P>The MSRC received this segment of the report which incorporates 38 projects totaling $9,764,416 funded in FY 1995-96 by the Committee, along with summary data and estimated emissions reductions on each project.  This portion of the report is due to CARB by January 15, 1997.  For your information, this report has been prepared in diskette form with embedded information as requested by CARB for compatibility with its computers.  The report in its entirety can be made available upon request. <I> </I>The report reflects well on the discretionary program, and the MSRC unanimously agreed to forward it to the Governing Board for consideration.  <I>[Due to its bulk, this report will be provided to </I><I>Governing Board Members only.  It is not included with this report and will not be on the </I><I>Internet.  A viewing copy of the screen prints is available in the AQMD&#146;s Library.] </I>
<P><B>Release of Program Opportunity Notice as Part of the FY 1997-99 AB 2766 Discretionary </B><B>Fund Work Program</B>
<P>As part of the FY 1997-99 AB 2766 Discretionary Fund Work Program being developed, the MSRC has decided to release a PON for the TCM category.  Specifically, this PON will solicit innovative market-based strategies and student education projects for improving air quality.  The PON allows flexibility and an opportunity for creativity from pre-proposers, and may result in an RFP or requests for full proposals which may result in sole-source efforts.  The PON is provided with this report for your information <I>(Attachment 1).</I>  Any RFPs or sole-source contracts will be submitted to the Governing Board for consideration prior to funding.
<P>It is anticipated that several FY 1995-97 Requests for Proposals will be submitted to the Governing Board for consideration in either March or April 1997.  I will keep you posted as developments move forward.
<P><B>Inland Empire Clean Fuels Corridor:  Public Agencies Implement an Electric Charging </B><B>Network</B>
<P>At the MSRC&#146;s meeting the MSRC-TAC Vice Chair, Michelle Kirkhoff, who represents the San Bernardino Associated Governments, provided a presentation on an Inland Empire Clean Fuels Corridor Project, which was partially funded by the MSRC and includes 15 electric charging stations.  The handout on this program is provided for your information <I>(Attachment 2).</I>
<P><B>Electric Vehicle &quot;Quick Charge&quot; Program</B>
<P>Saturn has advised us that to date 60 EV-1s have been delivered to customers for three-year leases using the $5,000 buydown incentive provided by the MSRC.  In addition, enthusiasm and interest has exceeded expectation, such that Saturn has had to hire additional personnel to handle the volume of people interested in leasing the EV-1.  I will keep you posted on this activity.
<P><B>1997 Meeting Schedule</B>
<P>The MSRC adopted a 1997 meeting schedule, retaining monthly meetings on the fourth Thursday, but rescheduling the commencement time to 1:00 p.m.  A copy of said schedule is provided with this report as <I>Attachment 3</I>.  
<P><B>Minutes</B>
<P>The minutes of the October 24, 1996, monthly meeting were approved, as submitted.  These minutes are provided for your information as <I>Attachment 4</I>.
<P><B>Reimbursement Report on Actual AB 2766 Discretionary Program Expenditures for FY </B><B>1996-97 First Quarter</B>
<P>In May 1996 the MSRC approved the reimbursement of miscellaneous administrative and mailing costs for FY 1996-97 for an amount not to exceed $30,000.  Every quarter staff prepares a report on actual costs for the MSRC&#146;s approval.  For the first quarter of FY 1996-97 miscellaneous costs in the amount of $3,471.34 were reimbursed to the AQMD.
<P><B>Contract Modification Requests</B>
<P>The MSRC took the following actions on requested contract modifications, as recommended by its Technical Advisory Committee:
<P>1) For City of Glendale Contract #C94051, which provides $273,500 to convert buses and construct a Park-n-Ride facility, approval of a four-month contractual term extension, but denial of a 5% increase based on the premise that the contractor has access to other funds which can make up the deficit including its AB 2766 City Subvention Funds;
<P>2) For Local Government Commission Contract #C95004, which provides $83,802 for a Cleaner Air through Better Land-Use Program, approval of a five-month contractual term extension, a scope change to provide for a follow-up workshop with the participating cities, and a cost reallocation which does not affect the overall project costs, with approval contingent on expanding the follow-up workshop to allow other cities that may be interested to participate;
<P>3) For U.S. Electricar Contract #C95017, which provides $325,000 for electrification of ground service equipment, approval of a one-year contractual term extension, but denial of release of the 10% withhold prior to final report submittal, contingent that the contractor try to find an alternate site for the demonstration program or move forward with installation of the equipment at Ontario Airport.  The contractor will also report back to the Committee in three months on the status of equipment installation;

<P><b>Proposal:</b><blockquote>Technical Guidance Document for Regulation XXX - Title V Permits</blockquote>
<P><b>Synopsis:</b><blockquote>AQMD&#146;s federally mandated Title V Operating Permit Program is expected to receive interim approval from EPA in January 1997.  Facilities subject to Title V are required to begin applying for a permit within the first year of program implementation.  To assist these facilities during this process, AQMD staff has prepared application forms and a Technical Guidance Document (TGD) that will provide simple instruction and clarification on compliance with Title V.  The TGD will be updated as needed to respond to program changes and the needs of regulated facilities.</blockquote>
<P><b>Committee:</b><blockquote> Stationary Source, December 5, 1996, reviewed.</blockquote>
<P><b>Recommendec Action:</b>
<blockquote>Receive and file the attached TGD.</blockquote>
<P> James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<br> Executive Officer
<P><hr>
<P><B>Background</B>
<P>Title V of the 1990 amendments to the federal Clean Air Act (CAA) requires EPA to establish a national operating permit program.  In 1992 EPA published regulations requiring AQMD and other districts to develop an operating permit program that complies with the federal regulations, submit the program to EPA for approval, and upon EPA approval, implement the program.  AQMD will begin implementing its Title V program upon receiving EPA interim approval, which is expected in January 1997.  Once EPA grants interim approval, AQMD must issue Title V permits to one-third of the affected facilities each year for the three years following interim approval.  Facilities subject to Title V must apply for and obtain a Title V permit, and comply with specific Title V procedures to modify their permit in the future.  Title V does not include any new requirements for further reduction of emissions, but it includes new permitting, monitoring, reporting, recordkeeping, public review, and EPA review requirements.
<P>To introduce the Title V program and help facility owners and operators understand how to apply for and maintain compliance with Title V, AQMD originally prepared a draft TGD on July 21, 1995.  This July 1995 draft version of the TGD was subsequently rewritten and reformatted to reflect changes to the Title V program and to make the TGD more user-friendly in providing Title V facilities with guidance in implementing this new program.  Since that time, AQMD staff has completed the following:
<P><ul><li>Released a new draft of the TGD for public review on May 24, 1996.  The May 1996 draft TGD is now divided into two volumes.  Volume I - Implementation Guidance, introduces the Title V program and discusses the program applicability, permitting and public participation processes, and compliance requirements.  Volume II - Title V Application Package, contains information to guide Title V facilities in preparing the standard application forms needed to apply for the different Title V application action types as required by Regulation XXX;
<P><li> Held two public meetings to highlight the important components in the May 1996 draft TGD.  The Title V Working Group and Public Consultation Meetings were held on May 30, 1996 and June 5, 1996, respectively;
<P><li> Extended the public comment period to June 28, 1996 from the original June 19, 1996 deadline to allow facility owners and operators time to review the document and thus ensure it met their needs in providing guidance on Title V;
<P><li> Received over 100 comments on the May 1996 draft TGD;
<P><li>Revised the TGD to address the comments received; and
<P><li> Compiled a list of all the comments and provided responses to the comments.</ul>
<P><B>TGD Objective</B>
<P>The final November 1996 TGD will assist facilities in answering the following general questions:
<P><ul><li> How does a facility determine if Title V applies?
<li>What is a Title V permit?
<li> How does a facility apply for and obtain a Title V permit?
<li> What forms are needed to apply for and obtain a Title V permit?
<li> How does a facility revise its Title V permit if there is a change at the facility?

<P>  James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<BR>  Executive Officer
<HR>
<P><B>Background</B>
<P>On October 15, 1993, the AQMD Governing Board adopted the RECLAIM program.  The rules have been amended a few times over the last three years.  The amendments have addressed three types of concerns:  technology assessments, EPA issues for rule approval, and minor technical adjustments.  This package of amendments is of the last type and continues to provide minor adjustments.
<P><B>Proposal</B>
<P>The proposed amendments to Regulation XX assist in effective program implementation.  The most significant proposals will:
<P>&#149; increase flexibility in monitoring and source testing requirements for non-operating and infrequently-operated major sources;
<P>&#149; add an option to use a concentration limit for reporting for a SOx Super Compliant source;
<P>&#149; allow new major sources 12 months for CEMS installation and certification; and
<P>&#149; clarify missing data procedures and valid data requirements.
<P>In addition, amendments are proposed to:
<P>&#149; clarify and add definitions;
<P>&#149; clarify the applicability to RECLAIM facilities (the NOx and SOx provisions in other AQMD rules and regulations);
<P>&#149; correct an emission factor;
<P>&#149; amend modeling requirements to be consistent with Regulation XIII - New Source Review; and
<P>&#149; provide alternative test methods and specify reporting requirements.
<P><B>AQMP &amp; Legal Mandates</B>
<P>There is no emission impact from these proposed rule amendments.
<P><B>CEQA &amp; Socioeconomic Analysis</B>
<P>Pursuant to CEQA, staff has prepared a draft Notice of Exemption (NOE) for the proposed amendments to Regulation XX - RECLAIM.  In addition, the proposed amendments to Regulation XX clarify and modify rule language for the purpose of ensuring consistency among all the rules in Regulation XX and to provide increased compliance flexibility.  As a result, there will be no significant cost impacts from the proposed amendments.
<P><B>Implementation Plan</B>
<P>The proposed amendments do not appreciably change the RECLAIM program and are not expected to change the implementation of RECLAIM rules.  Programming adjustments will most likely be required to the facilities' data acquisition systems and remote terminal units to reflect the changes in missing data procedures, valid data, and reporting codes.  As always, staff will be available to assist those facilities affected by the proposed amendments.
<P><B>Resource Impacts</B>
<P>Implementation of these proposals will result in more efficient use of AQMD staff time and Hearing Board time due to the reduction in the number of variances that will be filed for non-operating large and major sources.

<B>Background</B><p>
<A NAME="E16E2"></A>
The attached Goals/Objectives for 1998 will serve as the foundation for the AQMD&#146;s FY 1997-98 Work Program.  Emphasis for this year will be on the implementation of Title V and the development of new systems and programs to meet the requirements of Title III; permit registration and streamlining programs; an aggressive rulemaking calendar related to reaching the goals outlined in the latest revision of our AQMP, and implementation of an Area Source program.  Staff has continued to work with a Budget Advisory Committee made up of representatives of industry, environmental organizations, and interested public members to gain policy input and direction.  It is important to continue to encourage input into the budget process from as many interested parties as possible.  A public hearing gives all members of the public, as well as the Governing Board, the opportunity to provide input on the program goals/objectives for FY 1997-98.  A public workshop and public hearing to adopt the budget are to be scheduled April and May respectively.

<P><STRONG>PROPOSAL:</STRONG>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Execute Contracts for AQIP for the Third Quarter of 1996</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>SYNOPSIS:</STRONG>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Rule 2202 - On-Road Motor Vehicle Mitigation Options was adopted on December 8, 1995.  As one compliance strategy, Rule 2202 allows employers to invest in the AQIP.  Monies received are placed in a restricted account to fund programs that result in equivalent emission reductions that would otherwise have been achieved by the participating employers.  Staff evaluated the proposals received during the third quarter of 1996 and this action is to recommend several for funding.  The adjusted amount available for this quarter is $965,998.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>COMMITTEE:</STRONG>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Administrative, December 20, 1996, Recommended for Approval</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>RECOMMENDED ACTION:</STRONG>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>Authorize the Chairman to execute contracts for a total amount not to exceed $950,000 from the AQIP Special Revenue Fund to obtain mobile source emission reductions with: Market-Based Solutions, Inc. dba Old Vehicle Clearing House for an amount not to exceed $500,000; the City of Santa Monica for an amount not to exceed $350,000; and Antelope Valley Center for Telecommunications for an amount not to exceed $100,000.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<BR>Executive Office
<HR><P>
<P><B>Background</B>
<P>The Rule 2202 AQIP allows all employers to participate by electing to invest in an AQMD-administered restricted fund.  Investment can be either $60 annually per employee reporting to the worksite during the 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. peak window, or $125 per employee triennially.  The restricted monies are to be used by the AQMD to fund proposals that achieve mobile source emission reductions that would otherwise have been achieved by implementing a rideshare program.  This Board letter contains a discussion regarding the dispersal of funds from the AQIP compliance option for the third quarter of 1996.
<P>Upon registering under this option and submitting the designated investment amount, an employer is considered to be in compliance with the rule and there is no need for the employer to take further action to reduce mobile source emissions.  The collected monies are used to fund alternative mobile source emission reduction strategies that reduce mobile source emissions at a more cost-effective rate and could potentially result in greater overall emission reductions.
<P>The third quarter of 1996 submittal period ended on September 27, 1996 with 121 employers participating in the AQIP program.  The total AQIP funds received during this period was $1,368,628 (see Attachment 1, Table 1).  This amount includes both annual and triennial participants.  The Board has directed staff to reimburse, on a prorated basis, employers (with less than 250 employees) who will be exempt from Rule 2202 on January 1, 1997 due to the change in the state law [ Health & Safety Code Sections 40458 and 44243.5 added pursuant to SB 836 which was approved by the State Legislature August 31, 1996 and signed by the Governor on September 27, 1996] .  Staff recommends that $402,630 be set aside to reimburse these employers, and that $950,000 be used to purchase emission reductions to satisfy the one year and the three year requirements
<P>The exemption of employers with less than 250 employees and the prorated refunding of their AQIP contributions, will significantly affect the level of AQIP funding available for the remainder of 1996.  Specifically, the total amount of the refund, calculated for the third quarter is estimated at $402,630.  This refund will reduce the AQIP funding available for the third quarter to $965,998.  The net emission reduction commitments as of the end of the third quarter of 1996 are shown in Attachment 2, Table 2.  As a result of the emission reduction target adjustment for the current and past quarters, a deficit is shown for the 1996 balance of emission credits in the AQIP.
<P><B>Proposal Evaluation</B>
<P>During the third quarter of 1996, eleven proposals were received requesting funds ranging from $26,400 to $957,566.  The project proposals received can be grouped in five categories:  old-vehicle scrapping; alternative vehicle deployment; ridematching software/hardware; remote sensing; and vehicle repair.  Attachment 3 gives a summary of each proposal received, and funds requested.  Attachment 4 lists the proposals received, funds requested, total proposal costs, and emission reductions expected for each proposal.
<P>All proposals submitted are reviewed and scored based on the information in the proposal as submitted to the AQMD, and according to the selection criteria described in the RFP.  The evaluation panel was comprised of five members of the AQMD Transportation Programs Staff.  Two panel members are Hispanic, two are Caucasian, and one is Asian-Indian.  The RFP scoring process consists of two steps.  The first step is the technical evaluation in which each proposal is assigned points based on:  the potential of a proposed project to result in transportation technology and infrastructure improvements; the potential to achieve emissions reductions relative to the quarterly targets; and the overall expertise of the firm.  In the second step the proposals are scored according to cost effectiveness; if the firm is a local business enterprise; and if it is a certified MBE/WBE/-DVBE company or joint venture.  On December 16, 1996, the Federal District Court issued an order extending the prohibition against enforcement of Proposition 209 to all government agencies in California.  Therefore, the Governing Board&#146;s existing policy regarding MBE/WBE preference points remains in effect.  Attachment 5 discusses the selection criteria and summarizes the overall ratings of each proposal.
<P>The following proposals are recommended for approval:
<P>1. <B>Market-Based Solutions</B><B>$500,000</B>
<P>This project will generate mobile source emission reduction credits (MSERC) through an old-vehicle scrapping program through the purchase of triennial credits.  The MSERCs generated will meet the adjusted emission reduction targets established by the level of employer participation in the AQIP.
<P>2. <B>City of Santa Monica</B><B>$350,000</B>
<P>This project will generate MSERCs through the replacement of the city&#146;s heavy duty fleet vehicles such as refuse trucks, transfer trailer trucks, and street sweepers for a total of 40 vehicles.  The project also includes an outreach component and future plans to expand the CNG fueling station for public use.
<P>3. <B>Antelope Valley Center for Telecommunications</B><B>$100,000</B>
<P>This project will generate MSERCs through the installation of a teleconferencing system between the children&#146;s court in Monterey Park and the satellite court in the city of Lancaster, thereby reducing an estimated 28,000 vehicle trips in 1997, resulting in a total emission reduction of 17,638 pounds for the year.
<P>For the third quarter of 1996, the total recommended funding amount is $950,000 (see Attachment 6, Table 2).  Any remaining AQIP funds would be held for future proposal funding in subsequent quarters.  Both annual and triennial AQIP emission reduction targets for each performance target zone and for all participants during the third quarter 1996 will be met by the recommended proposals and the excess emission credits from previous quarters&#146; projects made available due to SB836 (Lewis).
<P><B>Outreach</B>
<P>The AQIP announcement was mailed to all Rule 2202 employers (approximately 4,500 worksites).  The availability of AQIP funds and the RFP were advertised in the Los Angeles Times, Orange County Register, Riverside Press Enterprise, Inland Valley Daily Bulletin, Los Angeles Sentinel, Eastern Group Publications, San Bernardino Sun, La Voz, La Opinion, Rafu Shimpo, Precinct Reporter, The Black Voice News, Chinese Daily News, Korea Central Daily, El Chicano, The Excelsior, Philippine News, &quot;h/mt Project Information Services,&quot; The M/W/DVBE Source, and the California State Contracts Register.  Copies of the AQIP announcement and the RFP were sent to the Black and Latino Legislative Caucuses and interested minority contractors/professional associations, transportation management associations and organizations, members of the Consultants Roundtable, attendees at AQIP bidders conferences, and any interested party.  In addition, a Bidders Conference was held at AQMD headquarters on September 4, 1996.

<P>BOARD MEETING DATE:  January 10, 1997 AGENDA NO.  5</b></center><br><p><br><br>
<P><b>Proposal:</b><blockquote>Transfer $1.5 Million from the Air Quality Assistance Fund to the General Purpose Agency Fund to be held for the Regional Transportation Agencies Coalition Pursuant to Health &amp; Safety Code Sections 40458 and 44243.5.</blockquote>
<P><b>Synopsis:</b><blockquote>The AQMD is required by Section 44243.5(a) of the Health and Safety Code to provide $1.5 million, on or before January 15, 1997, to Regional Transportation Agencies Coalition (RTAC) or its successor agency for the purpose of enabling regional or county rideshare agencies to provide marketing and client services to maximize voluntary ridesharing in the air basin.  Since RTAC does not have the authority to receive and safeguard funds, AQMD will transfer the money to an agency fund pending direction from RTAC for disbursement.</blockquote>
<P><b>Committee:</b><blockquote>Administrative, December 20, 1996, Recommended for Approval
</blockquote>
<P><b>Recommended Action:</b>
<blockquote>1. Transfer $1.5 million from the Air Quality Assistance Fund to the General Purpose Agency Fund, by January 15, 1997, to be held pending direction from RTAC for disbursement.
<P>2. Authorize the Executive Officer to disburse monies from this agency fund, as directed by RTAC, either directly to county or regional rideshare agencies selected by RTAC, or to one or more member agencies of RTAC which commits to safeguard and disburse the funds to county or regional rideshare agencies selected by RTAC.

<P><B>Background</B>
<P>On April 14, 1995, the Board adopted Rules 1501 - Work Trip Reduction Plans and 1501.1 - Alternatives to Work Trip Reduction Plans to comply with federal and state requirements for extreme nonattainment areas.  Subsequently, on December 8, 1995, in response to state legislation prohibiting the mandatory submittal of trip reduction plans, the Board adopted Rule 2202 - On-Road Motor Vehicle Mitigation Options as a replacement rule that did not mandate trip reduction plan submittals, yet allowed the AQMD to remain in compliance with Federal and State Clean Air Act requirements.
<P>Rule 2202 provides members of the regulated community with a menu of flexible and cost-effective emission reduction strategies from which they can choose to implement and meet the emission reduction target for their sites.  Compliance strategies made available to employers include old-vehicle scrapping; credits from clean on-road vehicles and off-road equipment; the use of remote sensing to identify and subsequently repair gross polluting vehicles; and emission reduction credits from stationary sources.  In addition, employers earn credits for the use of alternative fuel vehicles, the reduction of vehicle miles traveled, and other trip reduction activities.  An Air Quality Investment Program (AQIP) is also provided to employers, as a compliance alternative, with options for one year or three year compliance.  Furthermore, as an alternative to meeting an emission reduction target, Rule 2202 allows companies that elect to continue implementing traditional rideshare plans to be deemed in compliance with the Rule.
<P>On November 8, 1996, the Board amended Rule 2202 to be consistent with Health &amp; Safety Code Sections 40458 and 44243.5, which became law effective on January 1, 1997 [ Health & Safety Code Sections 40458 and 44243.5 added pursuant to SB 836 which was approved by the State Legislature August 31, 1996 and signed by the Governor on September 27, 1996] .  The new law directed the AQMD to raise the compliance threshold from 100 employees to 250 employees per worksite and could lead to a phase-out of Rule 2202 if equivalent emission reductions can be obtained through voluntary ridesharing or other replacement measures.  Additionally, this law directs the AQMD to annually appropriate $1.5 million to RTAC on or before January 15 of each year.  RTAC is to fully allocate the funds to county or regional rideshare agencies for the purpose of providing marketing and client services to maximize voluntary ridesharing.
<P>RTAC&#146;s membership consists of one representative from each of the following agencies:
<P><ul><li>Riverside County Transportation Commission
<li>Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation Authority
<li> Ventura County Transportation Commission
<li> Orange County Transportation Authority
<li> San Bernardino Associated Governments
<li> Southern California Association of Governments
<li> Imperial Valley Association of Governments
<li> Caltrans
<li> South Coast Air Quality Management District
<li> Ventura County Air Pollution Control District, and
<li> Mojave Desert Air Quality Management District
</ul>
<P><B>Proposal</B>
<P>Pursuant to the requirements of Health and Safety Code Section 44243.5, the AQMD is required to provide $1.5 million to RTAC by January 15, 1997.  Since RTAC does not have the authority to receive and safeguard funds, staff proposes that the Board transfer $1.5 million from the Air Quality Assistance Fund to the General Purpose Agency Fund by January 15, 1997, to be held on behalf of RTAC, and authorize the Executive Officer to disburse the funds as directed by RTAC.  RTAC may either direct the disbursement of funds directly to one or more county or regional rideshare agencies, or may select one or more of its own members to serve as custodian of the funds until recipient agencies are identified.  The RTAC agenda for its meeting on January 24, 1997, includes an item regarding the selection of a custodian for the funds.  Health and Safety Code Section 44243.5 reads as follows:
<P>(a)  The south coast district shall provide one million five hundred thousand dollars ($1,500,000) annually on or before January 15 of each year to the Regional Transportation Agencies Coalition or its successor agency.
<P>(1)  Until January 1, 1999, the south coast district may utilize revenues from the fund established pursuant to Health and Safety Code Section 40448.7 for the purpose of this section.  Notwithstanding subsection 40448.7(a)(1), the district shall not be required to annually allocate one million dollars ($1,000,000) to the Air Quality Assistance Fund to replace revenues allocated pursuant to this section.
<P>(2)  After January 1, 1999, the south coast district may utilize revenues received from civil and criminal penalties, out of court settlements or other sources for the purpose of this section.
<P>(3)  After January 1, 1999, the south coast district may utilize revenues generated pursuant to Health and Safety Code Section 44243 for the purpose of this section.
<P><B>AQMP and Legal Mandates</B>
<P>Health &amp; Safety Code Sections 40458 and 44243.5 became law effective January 1, 1997. The State and Federal Clean Air Acts require the AQMD to develop and implement employer-based emission reduction programs.  The proposed expenditure is expected to promote voluntary ridesharing and is not expected to adversely affect the attainment of clean air goals
<P><B>Emission Impacts</B>
<P>As a result of the new law, $1.5 million of AQMD funds will be redirected to programs marketing voluntary rideshare and client services.  The emission impacts of these programs to promote voluntary ridesharing will not be known until after January 1, 1998, but the intent of the Legislature is to achieve emission reductions equivalent to that which would have been attained under Rule 2202.
<P><B>Resource Impacts</B>
<P>Expenditure of these funds will result in a loss of $1.5 million from the AQMD&#146;s small business loan guarantee program.  The existing fund has a balance of $4.6 million, of which approximately $1 million is committed to actual loan guarantees.  The AQMD can spend $3.0 million from this account without jeopardizing existing loans.  However, the AQMD&#146;s ability to guarantee future loans might be constrained.
<P>After January 1, 1999, the AQMD must determine how continuing appropriation will be funded.  Penalty revenues ($1.0 million per year) are now spent on small business assistance and outreach programs.  The AQMD&#146;s share of funds ($12 million per year) received under the AB 2766 Motor Vehicle Registration Fee program covers the vehicle-weighted costs of basic air quality programs, including, but not limited to, emissions inventory, modeling, ambient monitoring and planning.

<P><STRONG><CENTER>BOARD MEETING DATE:  January 10, 1997 AGENDA NO.  6</CENTER></STRONG>
<P><STRONG>PROPOSAL:</STRONG>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Execute Contracts for Temporary Engineering Services</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>SYNOPSIS:</STRONG>
<BLOCKQUOTE> On September 13, 1996, the Board approved the issuance of an RFP to select contractors to assist with permit processing when needed to respond to temporary work load increases.  A panel has reviewed the proposals submitted in response to the RFP and recommends executing contracts to two firms.  In its September action, the Board also reallocated $200,000 in the FY 1996-97 budget for this purpose.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>COMMITTEE:</STRONG>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Administrative, December 20, 1996, Recommended for Approval</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>RECOMMENDED ACTION:</STRONG>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>Authorize the Chairman to execute contracts with AeroVironment Environmental Services, Inc. and Air Quality Specialists, for a total amount not to exceed $200,000 to assist in processing permits and provide services, as needed.  The actual amount of each contract will be determined by individual task orders to be determined in the future.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<BR>Executive Officer
<BR><HR>
<P><B>Background</B>
<P>Programs such as amnesty and Title V federal operating permits increase the number of permit applications that need to be processed beyond the normal workload.  To effectively respond to these temporary workload &quot;spikes&quot; and still maintain the permit processing time frames of 7, 30, and 180 days, it is necessary to periodically augment existing staff resources with outside engineering services.  Given that these outside engineering services will be used for <U>temporary</U> increases in work, it makes sense to contract additional resources rather than hire new staff.
<P><B>Proposal</B>
<P>In accordance with the AQMD&#146;s Consultant Selection Policy and Procedure, a public notice inviting proposals was published in:  <I>California State Contracts Register, Chinese News, </I><I>Eastern Group Publications, El Chicano, Hispanic News, Inland Empire Hispanic News, </I><I>Inland Valley Daily Bulletin, Korea Central Daily, La Opinion, La Voz, Los Angeles </I><I>Sentinel, Los Angeles Times, M/W/DVBE Source, Orange County Register, Philippine </I><I>News, Precinct Reporter, Rafu Shimpo, Riverside Press-Enterprise, San Bernardino Sun, The </I><I>Black Voice News, and The Excelsior.</I>  Copies of the RFP also were sent to the Black and Latino Legislative Caucuses and interested minority contractors/professional associations and vendors listed in the Los Angeles County, MTA, Cal Trans, and Inland Area MBE/WBE directories.  Further, the RFP was placed on the AQMD&#146;s Internet home page and bidders&#146; 24-hour telephone message line.
<P>A total of 27 RFPs were mailed in response to direct noticing and advertisement of the proposed RFP.  Eleven proposals were submitted.  The proposals were reviewed by a five-person (one female and four male) panel composed of two AQMD Senior Managers and two Senior Engineers (three from Major Source/RECLAIM/Title V and one from Local Commercial and Community Health, in the Stationary Source Compliance Office) and an engineer from the California Air Resources Board.  The panel&#146;s ethnicity consisted of two Asians and three Caucasians.  In addition, the top five firms (i.e., highest total score) were invited to an oral interview.  The interview was conducted by a five-person (three female, two male) panel composed of Assistant Deputy Executive Officer, Stationary Source Compliance; two Senior Managers from the Major Source/RECLAIM/Title V; and, two Senior Managers from Local Commercial and Community Health.  The panel&#146;s ethnicity consisted of one Hispanic and four Caucasians.
<P>Of the 11 proposals submitted, one was non-responsive to the RFP and five had a total score below 60 points.  The evaluation results for the top five bidders are as follows:

The Federal District Court has issued an order applicable to all government agencies in the state prohibiting enforcement of Proposition 209.  Therefore, it is not necessary to change the Board&#146;s existing policy regarding MBE/WBE preference points.  
<P>Based on the limited funding earmarked for this pilot program and the staff resources that must be invested with each company, staff recommends a maximum of two companies be selected.  Therefore, based on the RFP criteria, the top scoring firms of Air Quality Specialist and AeroVironment Environmental Services, Inc. are recommended to the Board to perform this work.
<P>Both firms will remain qualified for a period of two years.  As the need arises, AQMD staff will issue a firm fixed-price task order or time-and-material task order to the companies to perform permitting related work.  This bidding and pre-qualification process ensures that the AQMD can quickly obtain engineering services to adequately respond to a work load &quot;spike&quot; in the most cost-effective manner.

<P><STRONG>SYNOPSIS:</STRONG>
<BLOCKQUOTE> The streamlining and modernization of AQMD&#146;s air monitoring network is necessary to accomplish mandated requirements in the face of declining revenue and resources.  This RFQ is for the replacement of 17 NOx analyzers with modern, state-of-the-art equipment.  The newer technology is more reliable, easier to maintain, and less costly to operate with proposed staffing levels.  A total of $156,000 is available in the FY 1996-97 budget.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>COMMITTEE:</STRONG>
 <BLOCKQUOTE>Administrative, December 20, 1996, Recommended for Approval</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>RECOMMENDED ACTION:</STRONG>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>Approve the issuance of the attached RFQ to acquire Continuous NOx Analyzers for the Ambient Air Network. </BLOCKQUOTE> 
<P> James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<P> Executive Officer
<BR><HR>
<P><B>Background</B>
<P>As AQMD approaches air quality attainment and the air monitoring operations evolve into a maintenance mode, replacement of aging NOx analyzers is necessary.  The current analyzers, which are more than 14 years old, are well beyond their expected lifetimes of 5 to 7 years.  The replacement instrumentation is of newer technology and will require less maintenance, parts, servicing, and be will more automated and compatible with computer systems.  To insure the air monitoring capability is continued at acceptable levels as required by EPA, ARB and AQMD regulations, this equipment replacement is necessary.
<P><B>Proposal</B>
<P>The purpose of this RFQ is to competitively select a vendor(s) from which to purchase the Ambient NOx Analyzers for the air monitoring network.
<P>AQMD staff will advertise this RFQ in the following publications:
<P><I>Los Angeles Times; Los Angeles Sentinel; Eastern Group Publications; La Voz; Orange </I><I>County Register; The Excelsior; San Bernardino Sun; Precinct Reporter; El Chicano; </I><I>Inland Valley Daily Bulletin; Inland Empire Hispanic News; Riverside </I><I>Press-Enterprise; The Black Voice News; La Opinion; Rafu Shimpo; Chinese </I><I>Daily News; Korea Central Daily; Philippine News; The M/W/DVBE Source and the </I><I>California State Contracts Register.</I>
<P>Additionally, potential bidders will be identified through Los Angeles County&#146;s Directory of Certified Minority, Women, Disadvantaged and Disabled Veterans Business Enterprises; the Directory of Certified Firms published by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority; The Inland Area Opportunity Pages Ethnic/Women Business &amp; Professional Directory; the Caltrans electronic bulletin board listing of Disadvantaged and Women Business Enterprises; the AQMD&#146;s own electronic listing of certified minority vendors; and the Purchasing mailing list.  Copies of the RFQs will be sent to the Black and Latino Legislative Caucuses and various minority chambers of commerce and business associations, and public service announcements will be sent out to various local radio, TV, and cable stations.  The RFQ also will be posted on AQMD&#146;s Internet Web Site.  The preference to be awarded under Section IIC of this RFQ for MBE/WBE firms may not be awarded if it is determined that this is in violation of Proposition 209.
<P><B>Resource Impacts</B>
<P>A total of $156,000 is allocated for the purchase of the Continuous NOx Analyzers in the FY 96-97 budget.  In the Fixed Asset account, $36,000 has been appropriated for this equipment.  At its July 12, 1996 meeting, the Board recognized $120,000 from the EPA 105 Supplemental Grant, as follows:  $45,000 for the fourth year implementation of Photochemical Assessment Monitoring Stations (PAMS) program and $75,000 for the equipment replacement program of the existing NOx analyzers.

<P> James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<BR> Executive Officer
<BR><HR>
<P><B>Background</B>
<P>As AQMD approaches air quality attainment and the air monitoring operations evolve into a maintenance mode, replacement of aging Meteorological Sensor Systems is necessary.  The current systems, which are more than 25 years old, are well beyond their expected lifetimes of 15 years.  The replacement Sensors are of newer technology and will require less maintenance, parts, servicing, and be more automated and compatible with computer systems.  To insure the air monitoring capability is continued at acceptable levels as required by EPA, ARB and AQMD regulations, this equipment replacement is necessary.
<P><B>Proposal</B>
<P>The purpose of this RFQ is to competitively select a vendor(s) from which to purchase the Meteorological Sensor Systems air monitoring network.
<P>AQMD staff will advertise this RFQ in the following publications:
<P><I>Los Angeles Times; Los Angeles Sentinel; Eastern Group Publications; La Voz; Orange </I><I>County Register; The Excelsior; San Bernardino Sun; Precinct Reporter; El Chicano; </I><I>Inland Valley Daily Bulletin; Inland Empire Hispanic News; Riverside </I><I>Press-Enterprise; The Black Voice News; La Opinion; Rafu Shimpo; Chinese </I><I>Daily News; Korea Central Daily; Philippine News; The M/W/DVBE Source and the </I><I>California State Contracts Register.</I>
<P>Additionally, potential bidders will be identified through Los Angeles County&#146;s Directory of Certified Minority, Women, Disadvantaged and Disabled Veterans Business Enterprises; the Directory of Certified Firms published by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority; The Inland Area Opportunity Pages Ethnic/Women Business &amp; Professional Directory; the Caltrans electronic bulletin board listing of Disadvantaged and Women Business Enterprises; the AQMD&#146;s own electronic listing of certified minority vendors; and the Purchasing mailing list.  Copies of the RFQs will be sent to the Black and Latino Legislative Caucuses and various minority chambers of commerce and business associations, and public service announcements will be sent out to various local radio, TV, and cable stations.  The RFQs also will be posted on AQMD&#146;s Internet Web Site.  The preference to be awarded under Section IIC of this RFQ for MBE/WBE firms may not be awarded if it is determined that this is in violation of Proposition 209.
<P><B>Resource Impacts</B>
<P>In the FY 1996-97 budget, there is $72,000 allocated in Applied Science and Technology, and $18,000 in Planning and Policy, for the purchase of ten Meteorological Sensor Systems.  These funds were included in the EPA 105 Supplemental Grant for the fourth year implementation of the PAMS program which was recognized by the Board on July 12, 1996.

<P><STRONG>PROPOSAL:</STRONG>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Issue RFQ to Acquire an Automated Gas Chromatograph System for the Photochemical Assessment Monitoring Stations Program</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>SYNOPSIS:</STRONG>
<BLOCKQUOTE> The Photochemical Assessment Monitoring Stations (PAMS) program is in its fourth year of implementation and an Automated Gas Chromatograph System is needed for the Burbank PAMS Type 2 Site, slated to be on-line for the 1997 smog season.  This equipment is the most cost effective way to develop the required air monitoring data.  There is $70,000 allocated for the purchase of an Automated Gas Chromatograph in FY 1996-97 budget.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>COMMITTEE:</STRONG>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Administrative, December 20, 1996, Recommended for Approval</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>RECOMMENDED ACTION:</STRONG>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>Approve the issuance of the attached RFQ to acquire an Automated Gas Chromatograph System for the PAMS Air Monitoring Network.  </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<BR> Executive Officer
<HR>
<P><B>Background</B>
<P>The AQMD is providing VOC and carbonyl data to meet EPA&#146;s Ambient Air Quality Surveillance Rule 40 CFR Part 58.  In the 5-year plan submitted in 1993, the Burbank Type 2 Site is slated to start operation in June 1997.  Staff currently is using an Automated Gas Chromatograph at the Pico Rivera Type 2 PAMS site and believes this equipment is a more cost effective option of meeting the requirements of providing speciated, daily VOC analyses.
<P><B>Proposal</B>
<P>The purpose of this RFQ is to competitively select a vendor(s) from which to purchase the Automated Gas Chromatograph for the PAMS Air Monitoring Network.
<P>AQMD staff will advertise this RFQ in the following publications:
<P><I>Los Angeles Times; Los Angeles Sentinel; Eastern Group Publications; La Voz; Orange </I><I>County Register; The Excelsior; San Bernardino Sun; Precinct Reporter; El Chicano; </I><I>Inland Valley Daily Bulletin; Inland Empire Hispanic News; Riverside </I><I>Press-Enterprise; The Black Voice News; La Opinion; Rafu Shimpo; Chinese </I><I>Daily News; Korea Central Daily; Philippine News; The M/W/DVBE Source and the </I><I>California State Contracts Register.</I>
<P>Additionally, potential bidders will be identified through Los Angeles County&#146;s Directory of Certified Minority, Women, Disadvantaged and Disabled Veterans Business Enterprises; the Directory of Certified Firms published by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority; The Inland Area Opportunity Pages Ethnic/Women Business &amp; Professional Directory; the Caltrans electronic bulletin board listing of Disadvantaged and Women Business Enterprises; the AQMD&#146;s own electronic listing of certified minority vendors; and the Purchasing mailing list.  Copies of the RFQs will be sent to the Black and Latino Legislative Caucuses and various minority chambers of commerce and business associations, and public service announcements will be sent out to various local radio, TV, and cable stations.  The RFQ will be posted on AQMD&#146;s Internet Web Site. The preference to be awarded under Section IIC of this RFQ for MBE/WBE firms may not be awarded if it is determined that this is in violation of Proposition 209.
<P><B>Resource Impacts</B>
<P>There is $70,000 allocated for the purchase of the Automated Gas Chromatograph System in the FY 1996-97 budget.  This amount was part of the EPA 105 Supplemental Grant for the fourth year implementation of the PAMS program which was recognized by the Board on July 12, 1996.

<P>
<B><A NAME="About_AQMD"></A>About AQMD</B> 
<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District is the regional
government agency responsible for air pollution control in Los
Angeles and Orange counties and parts of Riverside and San Bernardino
counties. AQMD regulations must be approved by the state Air Resources
Board and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
<P>
<B><A NAME="What_is"></A>What is the Governing Board?</B> 
<P>
AQMD's Governing Board adopts policies and regulations that promote
clean air within its four-county area, the smoggiest in the nation.
Federal and state law require that AQMD achieve clean air standards
to protect public health. Before it makes decisions that affect
local residents and businesses, AQMD must consider ideas and comments
from the public. The opportunity to comment begins in public workshops
and ends with a public hearing by the Governing Board where anyone
can testify or present written comments. The Board usually meets
at AQMD's Diamond Bar headquarters on the second Friday of each
month.
<P>
<B><A NAME="Who"></A>Who serves on the Governing Board?</B> 
<P>
<A HREF="gb.html">The Board has 12 members</A>. Nine are elected
officials. Of these, four are county supervisors representing
<A HREF="la.html">Los Angeles</A>,<A HREF="orange.html">Orange</A>,
<A HREF="riverside.html">Riverside</A> and <A HREF="sanbernardino.html">San Bernardino</A>
counties, elected to AQMD's Board by their Boards of Supervisors.
Five are City Council members representing the cities in each
county (because of its size, Los Angeles County has two representatives).
These members are elected by their respective city selection committees.
The remaining three Board members are appointed by <A HREF="state.html">state</A>
elected officials; one by the Governor of California, one by the
Speaker of the State Assembly and one by the State Senate Rules
Committee.
<P>
<B><A NAME="Why"></A>Why are procedures necessary?</B> 
<P>
Government agencies like AQMD must create an accurate public record
of how they conduct the public's business. Documenting the process
is necessary to ensure public participation, fairness and an accurate
account to which you and other interested parties can refer in
the future. Holding public workshops, recording oral and written
comments, responding to those comments, publishing proposed rules
and related reports, holding public hearings and voting publicly
are all based on set procedures -- the building blocks of effective
decision-making.
<P>
<B><A NAME="What"></A>What happens at Board meetings?</B> 
<P>
Board Members discuss ways to improve air quality and establish
effective clean air programs. The Board receives reports from
AQMD's Executive Officer and staff who recommend new rules or
rule amendments to help reduce air pollution. The Board also hears
public testimony. After a public hearing, the Board may vote to
adopt a rule as proposed or with changes. In some cases the Board
may postpone a decision and instruct AQMD staff to develop a new
proposal. In addition, the Board approves contracts, policies
and various reports. The Board may also act on budget requests
and personnel matters.
<P>
Agenda items that involve relatively simple administrative decisions
are grouped in what is known as a <A HREF="gb_cal95.html">&quot;consent calendar.&quot;</A>
Board Members and members of the public may comment on any individual
item on the consent calendar. When discussion is completed, the
Board may vote on the consent calendar as a whole.
<P>
Also during meetings, Board Members report on activities of various
committees set up to explore specific issues. Standing Board committees
include Administrative, Legislation, Off-Road and On-Road Transportation,
Planning/Stationary Sources, and Technology. Additional committees
serve as advisory bodies to the Board. These include the Advisory
Council, the Ethnic Community Advisory Committee, and committees
on Interagency Implementation, Mobile Source Reduction Review,
Trip Reduction and Locomotive Propulsion Systems.
<P>
<B><A NAME="Where"></A>Where you fit in</B> 
<P>
The public is very much a part of the Board meeting. Public workshops
held weeks before the Board meeting give you the opportunity to
learn about proposed rules and major policies. Written reports
on rules or policies are available before Board meetings. Anyone
can testify on any item pending before the Board, but it's best
to prepare your testimony in advance. You can also bring up new
issues during the open comment session at the end of every Board
meeting.
<P>
<I><B>Off the record</B></I> <BR>
<TABLE BORDER><TR><TD><BR>
<I>If a Board Member receives information off the record and it
influences the Member's feelings about a proposed rule, the Board
member must put that information on the record. If that information
could substantially influence the Board's vote and was not available
to the public before the close of public testimony, the hearing
must be reopened to allow public comment on the new information.</I>
</TR></TD></TABLE>
<P>
<B><A NAME="How"></A>How to testify at meetings</B> 
<P>
Fill out a &quot;Request to Speak&quot; card and give it to the
Board Clerk. The Board Chairman will call your name shortly before
you are scheduled to appear. If there are seats vacant, you may
sit at the front of the auditorium near the speaker's microphone
so you'll be ready to testify. Please limit your testimony to
<B>three minutes. </B>The Chairman may give you more time if the
issue is complex or if you represent a large group.
<P>
If you have prepared written comments along with your testimony,
bring 25 copies with you and give them to the Board Clerk along
with your &quot;Request to Speak&quot; card. Each Board Member
will receive a copy. (Faxes are not accepted.)
<P>
After all testimony on a proposed rule has been heard, the Board
Chairman closes the public hearing. Then Board Members discuss
the issue and, usually, vote.
<P>
<I><B>Safe seating<BR>
<TABLE BORDER><I><B> <TR><TD><BR>
</B></I></B>o Be seated when the meeting is called to order. Fire
laws don't allow standing in the aisles.</I> 
<P>
<I>o If the auditorium is full, AQMD sets up nearby &quot;overflow&quot;
rooms where you can sit and watch the Board meeting on video.
If you have asked to testify to the Board, listen for your name
to be called and then move quickly into the auditorium.</I> </TR></TD></TABLE>
<P>
<B><A NAME="Continuances"></A>Continuances and changes</B> 
<P>
Due to intense public interest and lengthy testimony, the Board
may choose to continue its discussion of an agenda item at its
next meeting.
<P>
If significant changes are made to a proposed rule or rule amendment
<B>after</B> public notice has been issued, the Board can hear
public comment on the rule at the noticed hearing but cannot take
action on the changed text. The Board must publicly summarize
the text changes and continue the hearing to its next regular
meeting or later. At the continued hearing, the Board must allow
public testimony on the new text before taking final action.
<P>
In judging whether a text change significantly affects the meaning
of a rule, the Board considers its impact on emission reductions
and regulated facilities, the content of the original public notice
and the possible alternatives.
<P>
<B><A NAME="Auditorium"></A>Auditorium dos &amp; don'ts</B> 
<P>
<B>o</B> AQMD's auditorium is equipped with a closed-circuit video
network that captures images from 35mm slides, 8-1/2 by 11 inch
printed material and 1/2 inch VHS format videotape. You may use
this equipment to present your own material. For tips on preparing
effective visuals, call AQMD's audio-visual support staff at (909)
396-2023. <I>NOTE: To guarantee a clear image, text on overheads
should be larger than standard typewriter size--at least 14 pt--on
a white non-glossy background.</I> 
<P>
<B>o</B> If you need to bring an oversized chart to support your
testimony, make sure it is not higher or wider that 18 inches.
If it is, you'll need to get the Board Chairman's authorization
to bring it into the auditorium. Generally, placards, signs or
posters that are longer than 18 inches or have protruding sticks
or handles are not allowed in the auditorium for safety reasons.
<P>
<B>o</B> Megaphones and bullhorns are not allowed in the auditorium.
<P>

<P>
For more information about AQMD's Governing Board, contact the
Clerk of the Board's Office at (909) 396-2500.
<P>
Board meeting agendas and public notices are posted in the lobby
at AQMD headquarters. Proposed rules and amendments, staff reports
and other documents are usually available at the lobby Public
Information Center.
<P>
If you have a computer and modem, you can access Board meeting
agendas and minutes through AQMD's on-line bulletin board system
(ATDT 19093963621). For help using the on-line system call AQMD's
system administrator at (909) 396-2867. To receive Board minutes,

<I>This proposal implements Point XII of the Action Plan of the
Business Clean Air Partnership adopted by the Board at its April

Customer Bill of Rights</U>&quot; to assist businesses, the public
and AQMD staff in understanding of their rights and available
public services. A statement of the customer's &quot;Bill of Rights&quot;
on a pocket-sized card distributed to staff and the public, would
help improve customer service and facilitate greater mutual respect

to fund vehicle emission reduction projects in Fiscal Years (FYs)
1995-96 and 1996-97. The Mobile Source Air Pollution Reduction
Review Committee (MSRC) has proposed a two-year, $22 million program
for FYs 1995-97, subject to reauthorization in FY 1996-97 assuming
the AB 2766 funding remains available. This program consists of
the following: 1) Three Alternative Fuel Requests for Proposals
for Public Transit, School Buses and Heavy-Duty Vehicles; 2) A
Zero-Emission Vehicle &quot;Quick Charge&quot; Program consisting
of three components: a Request for Qualifications for vehicle
buydowns, a Program Opportunity Notice (PON) for participation
in a Corridor Communities Program, and an RFP for an Outreach
Coordinator; and 3) Three RFPs for projects to enhance or implement
Rail Feeders/Stations, Transportation Control Measures and Research
and Development. On June 22, 1995, the MSRC approved these RFPs,
the RFQ and the PON, and requests the Governing Board's approval
to release the documents to solicit proposals. This recommendation
was reviewed and approved by the Administrative Committee on June
23, 1995.</I>

as Part of the Fiscal Year 1995-96 AB 2766 Discretionary Work
Program</B> (Longville)
<P>
<I>The AB 2766 Discretionary Fund Program receives thirty cents
of every dollar of vehicle registration fees collected pursuant
to AB 2766. It is estimated that approximately $11.7 million will
be available in FY 1995-96. Of this $11.7 million, AB 2766 allows
5 percent to be used to support program administration. On June
22, 1995, the MSRC approved the reimbursement of technical, clerical
and contract administrative support consistent with the level
currently provided by AQMD staff. In addition, due to the complexities
of the FY 1995-96 Work Program, as well as the continued need
for support of past contracts, the MSRC committed additional monies
to provide enhanced technical and clerical support in the form
of two contract employees. The additional technical support will
be provided by Ray Gorski, previously of SAIC (the MSRC's former
Consultant Advisor), and one clerical contract employee. The MSRC
is requesting that the Board approve funding these two non-benefited
contract employees as part of the FY 1995-96 AB 2766 Discretionary
Work Program. This recommendation was reviewed and approved by
the Administrative Committee on June 23, 1995.</I>

<I>The Board previously authorized two separate contracts with
the University of California, Riverside's College of Engineering
- Center for Environmental Research and Technology (CE-CERT) to
conduct a variety of projects involving low-emission technologies
and clean fuels. Staff recommends that both contracts be amended
to allocate additional funding for CE-CERT to conduct follow-on
work. In the first contract, CE-CERT is conducting Phase I of
a baseline gasoline composition study, in preparation for wide-scale
introduction of advanced reformulated gasoline in March 1996.
Staff recommends AQMD funding in the amount of $80,000 to conduct
Phase II of this project, which calls for sampling and analysis
of 1996 reformulated gasoline. Under the second contract, CE-CERT
is conducting seven mobile source projects designed to provide
technical support and emissions testing for AQMP-related technologies.
Staff proposes a contract amendment to fund additional work by
CE-CERT on four of these seven projects, in an amount not to exceed
$490,000. The total proposed amount of new funding for this Board
action is $570,000. This recommendation was reviewed and approved
by the Technology Committee on June 14, 1995.</I>

strategy and to recommend any necessary revisions to the Plan.
ARB has yet to adopt the revised on-road mobile emissions factor
program. However, the State did adopt a long-range mobile source
control program as part of the State Implementation Plan approval.
In addition, the U.S. Congress has rescinded the Federal Implementation
Plan. Staff has prepared a report which reviews the impacts of

<I>Last December, the Board appropriated $600,000 to initiate
the PTEP. Some projects are now underway, and some projects are
scheduled to begin after July 1, 1995 as part of the second phase
of the program. Because not all of the AQMD's funds were committed
during the first phase in the FY 1994-95 Budget, staff recommends
that the uncommitted portion of the PTEP funds ($375,000) be re-appropriated
in the FY 1995-96 Budget for their original purpose. Staff also
recommends that the additional funds by PTEP co-sponsors be recognized

- Center of Environmental Research and Technology (CE-CERT) of
the University of California, Riverside for $69,574 to conduct
a field study for determining when fugitive dust &quot;best available
control measures&quot; become ineffective under high wind conditions.
This information is needed to provide improved technical data
as part of the federal PM10 SIP process. Due to abnormal weather
conditions during 1994, there were insufficient high-wind events
to meet the project objectives. To gain enough events, it is necessary
to continue the project through the 1995 fall windy season. Staff
recommends that the existing contract with CE-CERT be increased
by $19,872 for a contract total of $89,446. The additional funds
are available in Planning and Policy's Professional &amp; Special
Services Account in the FY 1995-96 Budget.</I>

The latest edition of AQMD Advisor, the news publication of the South Coast Air Quality Management District, is presented as an information item.



	Set Public Hearings to Consider Amendments to the AQMD's
Rules and Regulations, and to Adopt Any Necessary California
Environmental Quality Act Documentation as Follows:

On April 14, 1995:

 6.	Adopt Proposed Rule 1501.1 - Alternatives to Work Trip	(Wasikowski)
Reduction Plans	(909) 396-3624

Proposed Rule 1501.1 is being proposed to provide equivalent emissions reduction strategy alternatives to Rule 1501 - Work Trip Reduction Plans.  Proposed Rule 1501.1 would allow employers the choice of implementing any combination of these alternative strategies in lieu of complying with the requirements of Rule 1501.





 7.	Amend Rule 1501 - Work Trip Reduction Plans	(Wasikowski)

At the November 18, 1994 meeting, the Board directed staff to develop an amendment to Rule 1501 to streamline existing requirements.  The proposed amendment to Rule 1501 includes suggestions from the Rule 1501 Task Force, and written and verbal input from the public and AQMD staff.  The proposed amendment will reduce administrative requirements and costs to the regulated community and the AQMD.



On May 12, 1995:

 8.	Amend Rule 1171 - Solvent Cleaning Operations	(Leyden)
(909) 396-3120

The proposed amendments will clarify the cleaning of medical devices, polyester resin operations, flexographic and gravure printing.  In addition, the rule will be amended to include a de minimis level of solvent usage that will be exempt from the rule.  The necessary CEQA documentations are included.



 9.	Report of Civil Actions Filed	(Love)
(909) 396-3400



10.	Report Regarding Administrative Policy Pertaining to the	(Nikkila)
Purchase of Non-Consultant Services and Supplies	(909) 396-3010

This is to apprise the Board of steps taken to improve internal controls on expenditures.



11.	Report on the Study of the AQMD's Fee Structure and Authority	(Pearce)

With the recent changes in state legislation capping the AQMD's revenue and fee increases, coupled with the continued decline in revenue from stationary sources, the AQMD contracted for an independent analysis of its fee structure and authority to determine if the fees charged were both equitable and sufficient to fund the AQMD's stationary source activities.




12.	Recommendation to Recognize Revenue and Appropriate Funds to be
Received from the Southern California Association of Governments
and Amend the Contract with the University and Community College
System of Nevada for a Program for the Use of Remote Sensing	(Lloyd)
Devices to Detect High-Emitting Vehicles	(909) 396-2345

The Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) has made $42,000 available to supplement an in-progress, AQMD-sponsored project with the University and Community College Systems of Nevada (UCCSN) to develop a remote sensing program to detect high-emitting vehicles.  Staff is requesting that the Board recognize $42,000 in revenue from SCAG for the purpose of remote sensing, approve an additional $30,000 towards this program to be used for the cost of shipping and operation of a portable dynamometer from the U.S. EPA, and authorize the Chairman of the Board to execute an amendment to the agreement with UCCSN in the amount of $72,000.



13.	Recommendation to Amend a Contract for the Evaluation of PM10
Emissions from Vehicles in Southern California	(Lloyd)

Staff is proposing to join the current national efforts of the Coordinating Research Council (CRC) with the services of the UCCSN, to evaluate chemical composition of PM10, inhalable particulates (PM2.5), and other significant pollutants emissions from vehicles at the Sepulveda tunnel.  The AQMD is already co-funding CRC's current study at the Van Nuys tunnel.  This addition will be an amendment to a contract between the AQMD and CRC.  The total cost of the proposed addition is approximately $155,000.  National Renewable Energy Laboratory located in Golden, Colorado, will be supporting this amendment with a $55,000 funding.  Staff recommends that the Board authorize cofunding for this study in an amount not to exceed $100,000.



14.	Recommendation to Amend a Contract for the Demonstration of
Compressed Natural Gas Engines in Heavy-Duty Trucks	(Lloyd)

In 1991 the AQMD contracted with Acurex Environmental Corporation for the development and demonstration of Caterpillar and Detroit Diesel compressed natural gas engines in heavy-duty trucks.  The project is cofunded by the California Energy Commission, the Gas Company, and the U.S. Department of Energy.  Staff requests amending the contract to add $320,000 and extend the term to complete development and demonstration efforts.  Total direct project costs are $2,808,600, with total AQMD funding of $720,000.



15.	Recommendation to Cosponsor Durability Testing for a Natural Gas
Retrofit Kit for Medium- and Heavy-Duty Engines	(Lloyd)

Medium- and heavy-duty engines retrofitted to operate on natural gas can provide significant emissions reductions; however, ARB emissions durability testing requirements make it difficult to certify retrofit kits.  The proposed project with GFI Control Systems, Inc. will support emissions durability testing of a natural gas retrofit kit for a General Motors 454 engine.  The project also includes emissions durability testing of light-duty retrofit kits and has a total cost of $1,097,130.  Proposed AQMD funding is $150,000.  Other sponsors include GFI, Gas Research Institute, Canadian Gas Association and Natural Resources Canada.



16.	Status Report on AQMD Listing of Environmental Documents and Lead	(Broadbent)
Agency Projects Received by the AQMD for Review and Comment	(909) 396-3789

AQMD review and comment are subject to the screening criteria established by the Governing Board in March 1990.  This document also evaluates the Lead Agency response to AQMD comments.



17.	Rule Forecast Report	(Leyden)
(909) 396-3120



18.	Report on RECLAIM Allocation Adjustments Due to Permit Appeals
to the Hearing Board	(Leyden)

Pursuant to RECLAIM Rule 2015 (b)(4), any increases in annual allocations issued by the Hearing Board, pursuant to permit appeals, must be reported to the Governing Board annually in March.  While no changes were made to annual allocations at the Hearing Board itself, certain adjustments to RECLAIM allocations were made administratively by staff in the course of reviewing permit appeals filed with the Board.  Such changes to the allocations have not been significant and have not jeopardized equivalency.  This report covers allocation reviews from January 1, 1994 to January 1, 1995.



19.	Recommendation to Award Bid for the Management of the Diamond Bar	(Jason)
Headquarters Child Care Center	(909) 396-2065

On November 18, 1994 the Board approved a Request for Proposals to solicit qualified child care management firms for the Child Care Center at the Diamond Bar Headquarters.  This recommendation is to award the bid to the most qualified bidder.



20.	Recommendation Regarding Request for Quotations for Security Guard
Services at the Diamond Bar Headquarters	(Jason)

This Request for Quotations solicits bids from security companies to provide guard services at the Diamond Bar Headquarters.  Unarmed security guard services include manning the 24-hour security guard desk in the main lobby, monitoring electronic security equipment and cameras, patrolling the entire facility during the day and non-business hours, checking for proper District identification, logging visitor activity, etc.  The estimated expenditures are $644,000 for a 3-year contract.







20(A)	Recommendation to Approve Executive Officer's Goals/Objectives	(Lents)
for 1996	(909) 396-2100

and Recommendation to Amend the Fiscal Year 1993-94 	Staff:  Eichhorn
AB 2766 Discretionary Work Program	(909) 396-3240

As part of its Fiscal Year 1993-94 AB 2766 Discretionary Work Program, the Mobile Source Air Pollution Reduction Review Committee created a program designed to encourage the county transportation commissions to spend Surface Transportation Program, Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, and Air Quality Improvements funds on transportation control measures.  This ISTEA/TCM Partnership Program allocated approximately $1 million to each of the four commissions.  At its meeting on February 23, 1995, the MSRC approved an amendment to the ISTEA/TCM contract for the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority to provide funding for the purchase of CNG buses rather than CNG differential fuel costs as was originally requested.  Since the original project was included as part of the FY 1993-94 AB 2766 Discretionary Work Program, this contract change must be approved by the District Board.

29.	Report Regarding Status of Board Member Assistance Funds	(Mikels)



30.	Report on the Performance Audit of the AQMD for the Fiscal Year	(Pearce)
Ending June 30, 1994	(909) 396-2828

Health and Safety Code Section 40453 requires the AQMD to contract every three years with a qualified auditing firm to conduct a performance audit of AQMD activities.  KPMG Peat Marwick has completed their audit of the AQMD performance and issued their report.



31.	Recommendation to Direct Executive Officer to Develop Guiding
Principles for, and an Action Plan to Streamline, District Operations	(Mikels)



PUBLIC HEARINGS

32.	Amend Rule 2002 - Allocations for Oxides of Nitrogen and
Oxides of Sulfur	(Leyden)

Rule 2015(c)(3) requires that the Executive Officer perform a technology review for petroleum coke calciners.  The review has been completed and the Executive Officer has found that an increase to the year 2000 emission factor is appropriate.  This will result in an increase of approximately 0.21 ton per day in the year 2000 allocation.  To change RECLAIM NOx allocations, the Rule 2002 emission factor for calciners is proposed for amendment from 0.61 to 0.971 pound of NOx per ton of calcined coke.  The necessary CEQA documents will be included in the final board package.



33.	Amend RECLAIM Rule 2011, Appendix A - Protocol Monitoring,
Reporting, and Recordkeeping for Oxides of Sulfur (SOx); and
Amend RECLAIM Rule 2012, Appendix A - Protocol Monitoring,
Reporting, and Recordkeeping for Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx)	(Leyden)

Staff had proposed to amend Rule 2011, Appendix A, to make the missing data procedures for major SOx sources consistent with the major NOx requirements of Rule 2012, Appendix A.  Missing data procedures would then apply where there is no prior continuous emissions monitoring systems (CEMS) data available.  An additional proposal allows Cycle 1 major sources that do not have approved CEMS to apply different missing data procedures during the period of January 1, 1995 to June 30, 1995.  This proposal will amend Rule 2011, Appendix A, and Rule 2012, Appendix A, and will ensure Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 facilities in both NOx and SOx markets are treated equitably as to the missing data requirements.



34.	Amend Rule 1121 - Control of Nitrogen Oxides from Residential Type	(Lockie)
Natural Gas-Fired Water Heaters
(Continued from the February 10, 1995 Board Meeting)

The proposed amendments to Rule 1121 will not change the existing emission limits specified in this rule, but will clarify existing rule language.  The proposed amendments will also replace the existing certification testing protocol with a new, more accurate and reliable protocol which was developed jointly by AQMD, water heater manufacturers, independent testing laboratories, and the gas industry.  It will also include any necessary CEQA documentation.  Staff will provide further recommendations based on public comment presented at the February 10, 1995 public hearing.

35.	Recommendation Regarding a Closed Session to Consider
Pending or Potential Litigation and Personnel Matters	(Greenwald)

32.	Amend Rule 2002 - Allocations for Oxides of Nitrogen and
Oxides of Sulfur	(Leyden)<P>
<P>
<I>Rule 2015(c)(3) requires that the Executive Officer perform a technology review for petroleum coke calciners.  The review has been completed and the Executive Officer has found that an increase to the year 2000 emission factor is appropriate.  This will result in an increase of approximately 0.21 ton per day in the year 2000 allocation.  To change RECLAIM NOx allocations, the Rule 2002 emission factor for calciners is proposed for amendment from 0.61 to 0.971 pound of NOx per ton of calcined coke.  The necessary CEQA documents will be included in the final board package.<P>

<P>
<P>
33.	Amend RECLAIM Rule 2011, Appendix A - Protocol Monitoring,
Reporting, and Recordkeeping for Oxides of Sulfur (SOx); and
Amend RECLAIM Rule 2012, Appendix A - Protocol Monitoring,
Reporting, and Recordkeeping for Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx)	(Leyden)<P>
<P>
<I>Staff had proposed to amend Rule 2011, Appendix A, to make the missing data procedures for major SOx sources consistent with the major NOx requirements of Rule 2012, Appendix A.  Missing data procedures would then apply where there is no prior continuous emissions monitoring systems (CEMS) data available.  An additional proposal allows Cycle 1 major sources that do not have approved CEMS to apply different missing data procedures during the period of January 1, 1995 to June 30, 1995.  This proposal will amend Rule 2011, Appendix A, and Rule 2012, Appendix A, and will ensure Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 facilities in both NOx and SOx markets are treated equitably as to the missing data requirements.<P>

Natural Gas-Fired Water Heaters
<I>(Continued from the February 10, 1995 Board Meeting)</I><P>
<I><P>
</I><I>The proposed amendments to Rule 1121 will not change the existing emission limits specified in this rule, but will clarify existing rule language.  The proposed amendments will also replace the existing certification testing protocol with a new, more accurate and reliable protocol which was developed jointly by AQMD, water heater manufacturers, independent testing laboratories, and the gas industry.  It will also include any necessary CEQA documentation.  Staff will provide further recommendations based on public comment presented at the February 10, 1995 public hearing.<P>

Report on the Study of the AQMD's Fee Structure and Authority	(Pearce)  With the recent changes in state legislation capping the AQMD's revenue and fee increases, coupled with the continued decline in revenue from stationary sources, the AQMD contracted for an independent analysis of its fee structure and authority to determine if the fees charged were both equitable and sufficient to fund the AQMD's stationary source activities.    12.	Recommendation to Recognize Revenue and Appropriate Funds to beReceived from the Southern California Association of Governmentsand Amend the Contract with the University and Community CollegeSystem of Nevada for a Program for the Use of Remote Sensing	(Lloyd)Devices to Detect High-Emitting Vehicles	(909) 396-2345  The Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) has made $42,000 available to supplement an in-progress, AQMD-sponsored project with the University and Community College Systems of Nevada (UCCSN) to develop a remote sensing program to detect high-emitting vehicles.  Staff is requesting that the Board recognize $42,000 in revenue from SCAG for the purpose of remote sensing, approve an additional $30,000 towards this program to be used for the cost of shipping and operation of a portable dynamometer from the U.S. EPA, and authorize the Chairman of the Board to execute an amendment to the agreement with UCCSN in the amount of $72,000.    13.	Recommendation to Amend a Contract for the Evaluation of PM10Emissions from Vehicles in Southern California	(Lloyd)  Staff is proposing to join the current national efforts of the Coordinating Research Council (CRC) with the services of the UCCSN, to evaluate chemical composition of PM10, inhalable particulates (PM2.5), and other significant pollutants emissions from vehicles at the Sepulveda tunnel.  The AQMD is already co-funding CRC's current study at the Van Nuys tunnel.  This addition will be an amendment to a contract between the AQMD and CRC.  The total cost of the proposed addition is approximately $155,000.  National Renewable Energy Laboratory located in Golden, Colorado, will be supporting this amendment with a $55,000 funding.  Staff recommends that the Board authorize cofunding for this study in an amount not to exceed $100,000.    14.	Recommendation to Amend a Contract for the Demonstration ofCompressed Natural Gas Engines in Heavy-Duty Trucks	(Lloyd)  In 1991 the AQMD contracted with Acurex Environmental Corporation for the development and demonstration of Caterpillar and Detroit Diesel compressed natural gas engines in heavy-duty trucks.  The project is cofunded by the California Energy Commission, the Gas Company, and the U.S. Department of Energy.  Staff requests amending the contract to add $320,000 and extend the term to complete development and demonstration efforts.  Total direct project costs are $2,808,600, with total AQMD funding of $720,000.    15.	Recommendation to Cosponsor Durability Testing for a Natural GasRetrofit Kit for Medium- and Heavy-Duty Engines	(Lloyd)  Medium- and heavy-duty engines retrofitted to operate on natural gas can provide significant emissions reductions; however, ARB emissions durability testing requirements make it difficult to certify retrofit kits.  The proposed project with GFI Control Systems, Inc. will support emissions durability testing of a natural gas retrofit kit for a General Motors 454 engine.  The project also includes emissions durability testing of light-duty retrofit kits and has a total cost of $1,097,130.  Proposed AQMD funding is $150,000.

While no changes were made to annual allocations at the Hearing Board itself, certain adjustments to RECLAIM allocations were made administratively by staff in the course of reviewing permit appeals filed with the Board.  Such changes to the allocations have not been significant and have not jeopardized equivalency.  This report covers allocation reviews from January 1, 1994 to January 1, 1995.    19.	Recommendation to Award Bid for the Management of the Diamond Bar	(Jason)Headquarters Child Care Center	(909) 396-2065  On November 18, 1994 the Board approved a Request for Proposals to solicit qualified child care management firms for the Child Care Center at the Diamond Bar Headquarters.  This recommendation is to award the bid to the most qualified bidder.    20.	Recommendation Regarding Request for Quotations for Security GuardServices at the Diamond Bar Headquarters	(Jason)  This Request for Quotations solicits bids from security companies to provide guard services at the Diamond Bar Headquarters.  Unarmed security guard services include manning the 24-hour security guard desk in the main lobby, monitoring electronic security equipment and cameras, patrolling the entire facility during the day and non-business hours, checking for proper District identification, logging visitor activity, etc.  The estimated expenditures are $644,000 for a 3-year contract.       20(A)	Recommendation to Approve Executive Officer's Goals/Objectives	(Lents)for 1996	(909) 396-2100  This recommendation is to approve the changes requested by the Board at the February 10, 1995 meeting and to incorporate a change requested by the California Council for Environmental and Economic Balance.    <B>BOARD CALENDAR </B> 21.

Mobile Source Air Pollution Reduction Review Committee Report	(Paulitz)and Recommendation to Amend the Fiscal Year 1993-94 	Staff:  EichhornAB 2766 Discretionary Work Program	(909) 396-3240  As part of its Fiscal Year 1993-94 AB 2766 Discretionary Work Program, the Mobile Source Air Pollution Reduction Review Committee created a program designed to encourage the county transportation commissions to spend Surface Transportation Program, Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, and Air Quality Improvements funds on transportation control measures.  This ISTEA/TCM Partnership Program allocated approximately $1 million to each of the four commissions.  At its meeting on February 23, 1995, the MSRC approved an amendment to the ISTEA/TCM contract for the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority to provide funding for the purchase of CNG buses rather than CNG differential fuel costs as was originally requested.  Since the original project was included as part of the FY 1993-94 AB 2766 Discretionary Work Program, this contract change must be approved by the District Board.    28.

Report on the Performance Audit of the AQMD for the Fiscal Year	(Pearce)Ending June 30, 1994	(909) 396-2828  Health and Safety Code Section 40453 requires the AQMD to contract every three years with a qualified auditing firm to conduct a performance audit of AQMD activities.  KPMG Peat Marwick has completed their audit of the AQMD performance and issued their report.    31.	Recommendation to Direct Executive Officer to Develop GuidingPrinciples for, and an Action Plan to Streamline, District Operations	(Mikels)    <B>PUBLIC HEARINGS </B> 32.	Amend Rule 2002 - Allocations for Oxides of Nitrogen andOxides of Sulfur	(Leyden)  Rule 2015(c)(3) requires that the Executive Officer perform a technology review for petroleum coke calciners.  The review has been completed and the Executive Officer has found that an increase to the year 2000 emission factor is appropriate.  This will result in an increase of approximately 0.21 ton per day in the year 2000 allocation.  To change RECLAIM NOx allocations, the Rule 2002 emission factor for calciners is proposed for amendment from 0.61 to 0.971 pound of NOx per ton of calcined coke.  The necessary CEQA documents will be included in the final board package.    33.	Amend RECLAIM Rule 2011, Appendix A - Protocol Monitoring,Reporting, and Recordkeeping for Oxides of Sulfur (SOx); andAmend RECLAIM Rule 2012, Appendix A - Protocol Monitoring,Reporting, and Recordkeeping for Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx)	(Leyden)  Staff had proposed to amend Rule 2011, Appendix A, to make the missing data procedures for major SOx sources consistent with the major NOx requirements of Rule 2012, Appendix A.  Missing data procedures would then apply where there is no prior continuous emissions monitoring systems (CEMS) data available.  An additional proposal allows Cycle 1 major sources that do not have approved CEMS to apply different missing data procedures during the period of January 1, 1995 to June 30, 1995.  This proposal will amend Rule 2011, Appendix A, and Rule 2012, Appendix A, and will ensure Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 facilities in both NOx and SOx markets are treated equitably as to the missing data requirements.    34.	Amend Rule 1121 - Control of Nitrogen Oxides from Residential Type	(Lockie)Natural Gas-Fired Water Heaters(Continued from the February 10, 1995 Board Meeting)  The proposed amendments to Rule 1121 will not change the existing emission limits specified in this rule, but will clarify existing rule language.  The proposed amendments will also replace the existing certification testing protocol with a new, more accurate and reliable protocol which was developed jointly by AQMD, water heater manufacturers, independent testing laboratories, and the gas industry.  It will also include any necessary CEQA documentation.  Staff will provide further recommendations based on public comment presented at the February 10, 1995 public hearing.    <B>CLOSED SESSION </B> 35.

(909) 396-3240

The latest edition of AQMD Advisor, the news publication of the South Coast Air Quality Management District, is presented as an information item.



	Set Public Hearings to Consider Amendments to the AQMD's
Rules and Regulations, and to Adopt Any Necessary California
Environmental Quality Act Documentation as Follows:

On April 14, 1995:

 6.	Adopt Proposed Rule 1501.1 - Alternatives to Work Trip	(Wasikowski)
Reduction Plans	(909) 396-3624

Proposed Rule 1501.1 is being proposed to provide equivalent emissions reduction strategy alternatives to Rule 1501 - Work Trip Reduction Plans.  Proposed Rule 1501.1 would allow employers the choice of implementing any combination of these alternative strategies in lieu of complying with the requirements of Rule 1501.





 7.	Amend Rule 1501 - Work Trip Reduction Plans	(Wasikowski)

At the November 18, 1994 meeting, the Board directed staff to develop an amendment to Rule 1501 to streamline existing requirements.  The proposed amendment to Rule 1501 includes suggestions from the Rule 1501 Task Force, and written and verbal input from the public and AQMD staff.  The proposed amendment will reduce administrative requirements and costs to the regulated community and the AQMD.



On May 12, 1995:

 8.	Amend Rule 1171 - Solvent Cleaning Operations	(Leyden)
(909) 396-3120

The proposed amendments will clarify the cleaning of medical devices, polyester resin operations, flexographic and gravure printing.  In addition, the rule will be amended to include a de minimis level of solvent usage that will be exempt from the rule.  The necessary CEQA documentations are included.



 9.	Report of Civil Actions Filed	(Love)
(909) 396-3400



10.	Report Regarding Administrative Policy Pertaining to the	(Nikkila)
Purchase of Non-Consultant Services and Supplies	(909) 396-3010

This is to apprise the Board of steps taken to improve internal controls on expenditures.



11.	Report on the Study of the AQMD's Fee Structure and Authority	(Pearce)

With the recent changes in state legislation capping the AQMD's revenue and fee increases, coupled with the continued decline in revenue from stationary sources, the AQMD contracted for an independent analysis of its fee structure and authority to determine if the fees charged were both equitable and sufficient to fund the AQMD's stationary source activities.




12.	Recommendation to Recognize Revenue and Appropriate Funds to be
Received from the Southern California Association of Governments
and Amend the Contract with the University and Community College
System of Nevada for a Program for the Use of Remote Sensing	(Lloyd)
Devices to Detect High-Emitting Vehicles	(909) 396-2345

The Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) has made $42,000 available to supplement an in-progress, AQMD-sponsored project with the University and Community College Systems of Nevada (UCCSN) to develop a remote sensing program to detect high-emitting vehicles.  Staff is requesting that the Board recognize $42,000 in revenue from SCAG for the purpose of remote sensing, approve an additional $30,000 towards this program to be used for the cost of shipping and operation of a portable dynamometer from the U.S. EPA, and authorize the Chairman of the Board to execute an amendment to the agreement with UCCSN in the amount of $72,000.



13.	Recommendation to Amend a Contract for the Evaluation of PM10
Emissions from Vehicles in Southern California	(Lloyd)

Staff is proposing to join the current national efforts of the Coordinating Research Council (CRC) with the services of the UCCSN, to evaluate chemical composition of PM10, inhalable particulates (PM2.5), and other significant pollutants emissions from vehicles at the Sepulveda tunnel.  The AQMD is already co-funding CRC's current study at the Van Nuys tunnel.  This addition will be an amendment to a contract between the AQMD and CRC.  The total cost of the proposed addition is approximately $155,000.  National Renewable Energy Laboratory located in Golden, Colorado, will be supporting this amendment with a $55,000 funding.  Staff recommends that the Board authorize cofunding for this study in an amount not to exceed $100,000.



14.	Recommendation to Amend a Contract for the Demonstration of
Compressed Natural Gas Engines in Heavy-Duty Trucks	(Lloyd)

In 1991 the AQMD contracted with Acurex Environmental Corporation for the development and demonstration of Caterpillar and Detroit Diesel compressed natural gas engines in heavy-duty trucks.  The project is cofunded by the California Energy Commission, the Gas Company, and the U.S. Department of Energy.  Staff requests amending the contract to add $320,000 and extend the term to complete development and demonstration efforts.  Total direct project costs are $2,808,600, with total AQMD funding of $720,000.



15.	Recommendation to Cosponsor Durability Testing for a Natural Gas
Retrofit Kit for Medium- and Heavy-Duty Engines	(Lloyd)

Medium- and heavy-duty engines retrofitted to operate on natural gas can provide significant emissions reductions; however, ARB emissions durability testing requirements make it difficult to certify retrofit kits.  The proposed project with GFI Control Systems, Inc. will support emissions durability testing of a natural gas retrofit kit for a General Motors 454 engine.  The project also includes emissions durability testing of light-duty retrofit kits and has a total cost of $1,097,130.  Proposed AQMD funding is $150,000.  Other sponsors include GFI, Gas Research Institute, Canadian Gas Association and Natural Resources Canada.



16.	Status Report on AQMD Listing of Environmental Documents and Lead	(Broadbent)
Agency Projects Received by the AQMD for Review and Comment	(909) 396-3789

This report provides a monthly listing of environmental documents received by the AQMD, and a summary of projects for which the AQMD is preparing environmental documentation.  AQMD review and comment are subject to the screening criteria established by the Governing Board in March 1990.  This document also evaluates the Lead Agency response to AQMD comments.



17.	Rule Forecast Report	(Leyden)
(909) 396-3120



18.	Report on RECLAIM Allocation Adjustments Due to Permit Appeals
to the Hearing Board	(Leyden)

Pursuant to RECLAIM Rule 2015 (b)(4), any increases in annual allocations issued by the Hearing Board, pursuant to permit appeals, must be reported to the Governing Board annually in March.  While no changes were made to annual allocations at the Hearing Board itself, certain adjustments to RECLAIM allocations were made administratively by staff in the course of reviewing permit appeals filed with the Board.  Such changes to the allocations have not been significant and have not jeopardized equivalency.  This report covers allocation reviews from January 1, 1994 to January 1, 1995.



19.	Recommendation to Award Bid for the Management of the Diamond Bar	(Jason)
Headquarters Child Care Center	(909) 396-2065

On November 18, 1994 the Board approved a Request for Proposals to solicit qualified child care management firms for the Child Care Center at the Diamond Bar Headquarters.  This recommendation is to award the bid to the most qualified bidder.



20.	Recommendation Regarding Request for Quotations for Security Guard
Services at the Diamond Bar Headquarters	(Jason)

This Request for Quotations solicits bids from security companies to provide guard services at the Diamond Bar Headquarters.  Unarmed security guard services include manning the 24-hour security guard desk in the main lobby, monitoring electronic security equipment and cameras, patrolling the entire facility during the day and non-business hours, checking for proper District identification, logging visitor activity, etc.  The estimated expenditures are $644,000 for a 3-year contract.







20(A)	Recommendation to Approve Executive Officer's Goals/Objectives	(Lents)
for 1996	(909) 396-2100

This recommendation is to approve the changes requested by the Board at the February 10, 1995 meeting and to incorporate a change requested by the California Council for Environmental and Economic Balance.

As part of its Fiscal Year 1993-94 AB 2766 Discretionary Work Program, the Mobile Source Air Pollution Reduction Review Committee created a program designed to encourage the county transportation commissions to spend Surface Transportation Program, Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, and Air Quality Improvements funds on transportation control measures.  This ISTEA/TCM Partnership Program allocated approximately $1 million to each of the four commissions.  At its meeting on February 23, 1995, the MSRC approved an amendment to the ISTEA/TCM contract for the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority to provide funding for the purchase of CNG buses rather than CNG differential fuel costs as was originally requested.  Since the original project was included as part of the FY 1993-94 AB 2766 Discretionary Work Program, this contract change must be approved by the District Board.

Ending June 30, 1994	(909) 396-2828

Principles for, and an Action Plan to Streamline, District Operations	(Mikels)



PUBLIC HEARINGS

32.	Amend Rule 2002 - Allocations for Oxides of Nitrogen and
Oxides of Sulfur	(Leyden)

Rule 2015(c)(3) requires that the Executive Officer perform a technology review for petroleum coke calciners.  The review has been completed and the Executive Officer has found that an increase to the year 2000 emission factor is appropriate.  This will result in an increase of approximately 0.21 ton per day in the year 2000 allocation.  To change RECLAIM NOx allocations, the Rule 2002 emission factor for calciners is proposed for amendment from 0.61 to 0.971 pound of NOx per ton of calcined coke.  The necessary CEQA documents will be included in the final board package.



33.	Amend RECLAIM Rule 2011, Appendix A - Protocol Monitoring,
Reporting, and Recordkeeping for Oxides of Sulfur (SOx); and
Amend RECLAIM Rule 2012, Appendix A - Protocol Monitoring,
Reporting, and Recordkeeping for Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx)	(Leyden)

Staff had proposed to amend Rule 2011, Appendix A, to make the missing data procedures for major SOx sources consistent with the major NOx requirements of Rule 2012, Appendix A.  Missing data procedures would then apply where there is no prior continuous emissions monitoring systems (CEMS) data available.  An additional proposal allows Cycle 1 major sources that do not have approved CEMS to apply different missing data procedures during the period of January 1, 1995 to June 30, 1995.  This proposal will amend Rule 2011, Appendix A, and Rule 2012, Appendix A, and will ensure Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 facilities in both NOx and SOx markets are treated equitably as to the missing data requirements.



34.	Amend Rule 1121 - Control of Nitrogen Oxides from Residential Type	(Lockie)
Natural Gas-Fired Water Heaters
(Continued from the February 10, 1995 Board Meeting)

The proposed amendments to Rule 1121 will not change the existing emission limits specified in this rule, but will clarify existing rule language.  The proposed amendments will also replace the existing certification testing protocol with a new, more accurate and reliable protocol which was developed jointly by AQMD, water heater manufacturers, independent testing laboratories, and the gas industry.  It will also include any necessary CEQA documentation.  Staff will provide further recommendations based on public comment presented at the February 10, 1995 public hearing.

	Set Public Hearings to Consider Amendments to the AQMD's
Rules and Regulations, and to Adopt Any Necessary California
Environmental Quality Act Documentation as Follows:

On April 14, 1995:

 6.	Adopt Proposed Rule 1501.1 - Alternatives to Work Trip	(Wasikowski)
Reduction Plans	(909) 396-3624

Proposed Rule 1501.1 is being proposed to provide equivalent emissions reduction strategy alternatives to Rule 1501 - Work Trip Reduction Plans.  Proposed Rule 1501.1 would allow employers the choice of implementing any combination of these alternative strategies in lieu of complying with the requirements of Rule 1501.





 7.	Amend Rule 1501 - Work Trip Reduction Plans	(Wasikowski)

At the November 18, 1994 meeting, the Board directed staff to develop an amendment to Rule 1501 to streamline existing requirements.  The proposed amendment to Rule 1501 includes suggestions from the Rule 1501 Task Force, and written and verbal input from the public and AQMD staff.  The proposed amendment will reduce administrative requirements and costs to the regulated community and the AQMD.



On May 12, 1995:

 8.	Amend Rule 1171 - Solvent Cleaning Operations	(Leyden)
(909) 396-3120

The proposed amendments will clarify the cleaning of medical devices, polyester resin operations, flexographic and gravure printing.  In addition, the rule will be amended to include a de minimis level of solvent usage that will be exempt from the rule.  The necessary CEQA documentations are included.

(909) 396-3400



10.	Report Regarding Administrative Policy Pertaining to the	(Nikkila)
Purchase of Non-Consultant Services and Supplies	(909) 396-3010

This is to apprise the Board of steps taken to improve internal controls on expenditures.



11.	Report on the Study of the AQMD's Fee Structure and Authority	(Pearce)

With the recent changes in state legislation capping the AQMD's revenue and fee increases, coupled with the continued decline in revenue from stationary sources, the AQMD contracted for an independent analysis of its fee structure and authority to determine if the fees charged were both equitable and sufficient to fund the AQMD's stationary source activities.




12.	Recommendation to Recognize Revenue and Appropriate Funds to be
Received from the Southern California Association of Governments
and Amend the Contract with the University and Community College
System of Nevada for a Program for the Use of Remote Sensing	(Lloyd)
Devices to Detect High-Emitting Vehicles	(909) 396-2345

The Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) has made $42,000 available to supplement an in-progress, AQMD-sponsored project with the University and Community College Systems of Nevada (UCCSN) to develop a remote sensing program to detect high-emitting vehicles.  Staff is requesting that the Board recognize $42,000 in revenue from SCAG for the purpose of remote sensing, approve an additional $30,000 towards this program to be used for the cost of shipping and operation of a portable dynamometer from the U.S. EPA, and authorize the Chairman of the Board to execute an amendment to the agreement with UCCSN in the amount of $72,000.



13.	Recommendation to Amend a Contract for the Evaluation of PM10
Emissions from Vehicles in Southern California	(Lloyd)

Staff is proposing to join the current national efforts of the Coordinating Research Council (CRC) with the services of the UCCSN, to evaluate chemical composition of PM10, inhalable particulates (PM2.5), and other significant pollutants emissions from vehicles at the Sepulveda tunnel.  The AQMD is already co-funding CRC's current study at the Van Nuys tunnel.  This addition will be an amendment to a contract between the AQMD and CRC.  The total cost of the proposed addition is approximately $155,000.  National Renewable Energy Laboratory located in Golden, Colorado, will be supporting this amendment with a $55,000 funding.  Staff recommends that the Board authorize cofunding for this study in an amount not to exceed $100,000.



14.	Recommendation to Amend a Contract for the Demonstration of
Compressed Natural Gas Engines in Heavy-Duty Trucks	(Lloyd)

In 1991 the AQMD contracted with Acurex Environmental Corporation for the development and demonstration of Caterpillar and Detroit Diesel compressed natural gas engines in heavy-duty trucks.  The project is cofunded by the California Energy Commission, the Gas Company, and the U.S. Department of Energy.  Staff requests amending the contract to add $320,000 and extend the term to complete development and demonstration efforts.  Total direct project costs are $2,808,600, with total AQMD funding of $720,000.



15.	Recommendation to Cosponsor Durability Testing for a Natural Gas
Retrofit Kit for Medium- and Heavy-Duty Engines	(Lloyd)

Medium- and heavy-duty engines retrofitted to operate on natural gas can provide significant emissions reductions; however, ARB emissions durability testing requirements make it difficult to certify retrofit kits.  The proposed project with GFI Control Systems, Inc. will support emissions durability testing of a natural gas retrofit kit for a General Motors 454 engine.  The project also includes emissions durability testing of light-duty retrofit kits and has a total cost of $1,097,130.  Proposed AQMD funding is $150,000.  Other sponsors include GFI, Gas Research Institute, Canadian Gas Association and Natural Resources Canada.



16.	Status Report on AQMD Listing of Environmental Documents and Lead	(Broadbent)
Agency Projects Received by the AQMD for Review and Comment	(909) 396-3789

This report provides a monthly listing of environmental documents received by the AQMD, and a summary of projects for which the AQMD is preparing environmental documentation.  AQMD review and comment are subject to the screening criteria established by the Governing Board in March 1990.  This document also evaluates the Lead Agency response to AQMD comments.



17.	Rule Forecast Report	(Leyden)
(909) 396-3120



18.	Report on RECLAIM Allocation Adjustments Due to Permit Appeals
to the Hearing Board	(Leyden)

Pursuant to RECLAIM Rule 2015 (b)(4), any increases in annual allocations issued by the Hearing Board, pursuant to permit appeals, must be reported to the Governing Board annually in March.  While no changes were made to annual allocations at the Hearing Board itself, certain adjustments to RECLAIM allocations were made administratively by staff in the course of reviewing permit appeals filed with the Board.  Such changes to the allocations have not been significant and have not jeopardized equivalency.  This report covers allocation reviews from January 1, 1994 to January 1, 1995.



19.	Recommendation to Award Bid for the Management of the Diamond Bar	(Jason)
Headquarters Child Care Center	(909) 396-2065

On November 18, 1994 the Board approved a Request for Proposals to solicit qualified child care management firms for the Child Care Center at the Diamond Bar Headquarters.  This recommendation is to award the bid to the most qualified bidder.



20.	Recommendation Regarding Request for Quotations for Security Guard
Services at the Diamond Bar Headquarters	(Jason)

This Request for Quotations solicits bids from security companies to provide guard services at the Diamond Bar Headquarters.  Unarmed security guard services include manning the 24-hour security guard desk in the main lobby, monitoring electronic security equipment and cameras, patrolling the entire facility during the day and non-business hours, checking for proper District identification, logging visitor activity, etc.  The estimated expenditures are $644,000 for a 3-year contract.

32.	Amend Rule 2002 - Allocations for Oxides of Nitrogen and
Oxides of Sulfur	(Leyden)

Rule 2015(c)(3) requires that the Executive Officer perform a technology review for petroleum coke calciners.  The review has been completed and the Executive Officer has found that an increase to the year 2000 emission factor is appropriate.  This will result in an increase of approximately 0.21 ton per day in the year 2000 allocation.  To change RECLAIM NOx allocations, the Rule 2002 emission factor for calciners is proposed for amendment from 0.61 to 0.971 pound of NOx per ton of calcined coke.  The necessary CEQA documents will be included in the final board package.



33.	Amend RECLAIM Rule 2011, Appendix A - Protocol Monitoring,
Reporting, and Recordkeeping for Oxides of Sulfur (SOx); and
Amend RECLAIM Rule 2012, Appendix A - Protocol Monitoring,
Reporting, and Recordkeeping for Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx)	(Leyden)

Staff had proposed to amend Rule 2011, Appendix A, to make the missing data procedures for major SOx sources consistent with the major NOx requirements of Rule 2012, Appendix A.  Missing data procedures would then apply where there is no prior continuous emissions monitoring systems (CEMS) data available.  An additional proposal allows Cycle 1 major sources that do not have approved CEMS to apply different missing data procedures during the period of January 1, 1995 to June 30, 1995.

	Ms. Soto asked if the proposed rule could include a commitment from the AQMD to provide training for those communities that do not have adequate technical resources.  
Barry Wallerstein, DEO/Planning & Information Management, responded that if the Board adopts the proposed rule, staff plans to conduct training for the communities in order to facilitate use of the rule.  Staff could address disadvantaged communities as part of the outreach for the training.  Additionally, language could be included in the adopting resolution for the proposed rule which would address the issue of training for disadvantaged communities.<P>

	Mr. Antonovich brought attention to a letter he received from Renzo Venturo of GM Hughes Electronics regarding Agenda Item No. 6 (Set Hearing on April 14, 1995 to Adopt Proposed Rule 1501.1).  He distributed to Board members copies of the letter, in which 
Mr. Venturo requested a one-month delay of the public hearing on this item in order to meet with AQMD staff regarding a number of technical issues in the current draft rule language that needed to be resolved by staff with the California Air Resources Board (ARB) and with the regulated community.<P>
<P>
	Mr. Wallerstein responded that he spoke with Mr. Venturo before the Board meeting regarding the comments in his letter, and assured him that AQMD staff will work diligently with Mr. Venturo's staff to clarify various points and resolve their concerns, to the extent feasible, before the public hearing in April.  Mr. Venturo indicated his willingness to have the Board set the public hearing for April 14, with the understanding that if their concerns are not resolved, they will request that the Board delay the public hearing.<P>

	<B>Curtis Coleman</B> addressed the Board on behalf of the <B>California Manufacturers'</B> <B>Association Air Quality Alliance.</B>  He commented that although the study was useful in allowing the public to gain a better understanding, in a general sense, of what District programs are being implemented, how much those programs cost to implement and how the programs are funded;  it was only a small first step.  Additional studies need to be made which:  (i) evaluate the cost of each of the AQMD's programs versus program effectiveness, in terms of emission reduction or other program goals;  (ii) make recommendations regarding operational practices that could be implemented by the AQMD to improve productivity;  (iii) evaluate the amount of resources being devoted to stationary source emission reduction programs versus mobile source emission reduction programs;  (iv) identify which programs are mandated by federal and state laws and which are authorized, but not required, by those laws;  and (v) determine whether any AQMD programs duplicate, overlap or conflict with state or federal air quality regulatory programs.<P>
<P>
	Mr. Silva expressed his desire that:  (i) the AQMD exhaust all reasonable ways of reducing the cost of providing services before considering any of the consultant's recommendations regarding fee increases;  (ii) operating fees be based on actual emissions instead of potential emissions;  (iii) when the AQMD considers alternative sources of revenue, that mobile sources be considered first;  and (iv) that the authority for increased funding be placed with the ARB.<P>
<P>
	Dr. Lents commented that the recommendations in the report are from the firm that conducted the study, and not from AQMD staff; nor do they represent the opinion of the Board.  Also, any fee increases would have to be discussed in a public meeting and adopted by the Board.<P>
<P>
18.	Report on RECLAIM Allocation Adjustments Due to Permit Appeals to the Hearing Board<P>
<P>
	In response to a question by Dr. Burke, Ms. Leyden indicated that 4 of the 49 facilities removed from RECLAIM were the result of operations going out of business.<P>
<P>
20.	Recommendation Regarding Request for Quotations for Security Guard Services at the Diamond Bar Headquarters<P>
<P>
	Ms. Soto questioned why the AQMD needed so much security ($644,000/three-year period).  Dr. Lents responded that the AQMD has historically had problems with unauthorized persons entering the premises and removing data from files, and therefore contracted for security services.  During 1994, disruptions at two Board meetings and the disappearance of equipment worth thousands of dollars from the AQMD necessitated an increase in security services.<P>
<P>
(Ms. Haggard arrived at 10:10 a.m.)<P>
<P>
	In response to a question by Mr. Silva concerning cost comparison with security services for the private sector , Nick Nikkila, Assistant DEO/Technical Support Services, explained that the competitive nature of the bidding process tends to eliminate very high bids and the bid is typically awarded to the company providing the best service at the lowest possible cost.<P>
<P>
ON MOTION OF MR. PAULITZ, DULY SECONDED, THE BOARD APPROVED AGENDA ITEMS 3, 6, 8 (Including Errata sheets), 11, 18 AND 20 BY UNANIMOUS CONSENT OF THE BOARD MEMBERS PRESENT.  (Absent:  Braude, Loveridge and Wilson.)<P>

<P>
	In response to Mr. Albright's question as to why Agenda Item No. 19 was being continued to April, Mr. Nikkila stated that receipt of additional information from the company recommended by staff for award of the bid made it necessary for staff to enter into further negotiations with them before making a recommendation to the Board.<P>
<P>

<P>
	With regard to Agenda Item No. 20(A), Mr. Antonovich complimented staff on the revised goals and objectives, which recognize that a strong economy and clean air are not mutually exclusive.<P>

<P>
	Expressing his support for the addition of this item to the Board's monthly meeting agenda, Mr. Paulitz commented that when he was on the Advisory Council he recommended that the Board be made aware of the Council's actions.<P>
<P>
29.	Report Regarding Status of Board Member Assistance Funds<P>
<P>
<P>
ON MOTION OF MR. ALBRIGHT, SECONDED BY MR. PAULITZ, AGENDA ITEMS 21 THROUGH 29 WERE APPROVED AS RECOMMENDED BY UNANIMOUS CONSENT OF THE BOARD MEMBERS PRESENT.  (Absent:  Braude, Loveridge and Wilson.)<P>
<P>
30.	Report on the Performance Audit of the AQMD for the Fiscal Year Ending June 30, 1994<P>
<P>
	Julia Kirwan and Susan Foreman of KPMG Peat Marwick LLP (KPMG) gave a brief slide presentation reviewing the state mandate, highlighting the key points of the audit report and discussing KPMG's findings and recommendations.<P>
<P>
	In response to Ms. Soto's request for postponement of this item to allow sufficient time to review the report, Dr. Lents stated that the AQMD was required to submit the report to the State Legislature by April 1, 1995.  Ms. Soto stated that she received the report just two days before the Board meeting, and she asked that in the future staff allow her more time to review such comprehensive reports as this one.<P>
<P>
	Expressing his displeasure that the AQMD was singled out by the State Legislature for these performance audits, Mr. Albright questioned the usefulness of the audit and pointed out the redundancy of having a consultant conduct a study to conclude that the South Coast region has the worst air quality.  Doubtful that the majority of legislators who voted for the performance audit actually review it, he added that the AQMD's legislative consultant in Sacramento should offer to brief those legislators on the audit by KPMG.<P>
<P>

	Speaking in support of the performance audit, Mr. Paulitz expressed his belief that the audit does what the legislature intended; and that is to list each AQMD program and explain what is being done in each program.  Referring to Finding No. 6 of the audit report, he expressed disappointment that funding for the Cut Smog and Smoking Vehicle programs have been greatly reduced.  Since there is no mandatory requirement, he believed the State Legislature should be encouraged to make it mandatory to repair smoking vehicles.  Referring to Finding No. 10, which indicates that the AQMD continues to rely on a diminishing source of revenue, he commented that revenue from other sources will have to be increased because even when the minimum clean air standards are met, there will still be a need for the AQMD to insure maintenance of those standards.<P>
<P>
	Mr. Braude agreed with Mr. Albright's remarks concerning redundancy and the purpose of the audit.  He suggested that the audit be referred to the Administrative Committee for review and discussion concerning advocacy of constructive changes in the state mandate.<P>
<P>
	At Chairman Mikels' request, Intergovernmental Affairs Officer Catherine Witherspoon clarified that traditionally reports due to the Legislature are submitted to the clerks on both Houses, to the author of the bill, and to the committees which overheard the matter.  In this instance, copies of the report could also be sent to those members who have expressed interest in the AQMD's financial affairs, so that they too could be offered the briefing.<P>
<P>
Curtis Coleman addressed the Board and commented that the performance audit report was not the type of report which he was referring to in his earlier comments on Agenda Item 
No. 11.  During those comments, one of the issues he asked to be addressed was federal and state mandates versus permissive programs.  While he had not yet had the opportunity to fully review the audit report, he noticed that there was a matrix table in Appendix B of the report purporting to identify AQMD programs implemented pursuant to state and federal mandates--which he believed was not entirely correct.  He suggested that for the upcoming fiscal year, the AQMD conduct a study which would list AQMD's programs, describing each program in an understandable manner, and provide an evaluation of the cost and actual benefit or impact of each program.<P>
<P>
	Chairman Mikels added that after reviewing the audit report fully, Mr. Coleman, as well as Ms. Soto and anyone else, could submit comments to the Administrative Committee.  Mr. Silva added his concurrence with Ms. Soto's comments with respect to there not being sufficient time allowed for review of the audit report.<P>
<P>
MR. ALBRIGHT MOVED TO RECEIVE AND FILE THE PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT, TRANSMIT THE REPORT TO THE STATE LEGISLATURE, AND REFER THE MATTER TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE COMMITTEE FOR REVIEW AND DISCUSSION REGARDING ADVOCACY OF CONSTRUCTIVE CHANGES IN LEGISLATION REQUIRING PERFORMANCE AUDITS OF THE SCAQMD.  THE MOTION WAS SECONDED BY MR. PAULITZ, AND PASSED BY A UNANIMOUS VOTE OF THE BOARD MEMBERS PRESENT.  (Absent:  Loveridge and Wilson.)<P>
<P>
31.	Recommendation to Direct Executive Officer to Develop Guiding Principles for, and an Action Plan to Streamline, District Operations<P>
<P>
	Chairman Mikels commented that this recommendation stemmed from his concern that while the AQMD has made significant progress in terms of streamlining operations, reducing red tape and making compliance with AQMD rules and regulations less onerous to the regulated community, much more should be done.<P>
<P>
MS. SOTO MOVED TO DIRECT THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER TO DEVELOP A SET OF GUIDING PRINCIPLES TO GOVERN DISTRICT OPERATIONS AND AN ACTION PLAN FOR REDUCING RED TAPE AND MAKING COMPLIANCE LESS ONEROUS, AND PRESENT A DRAFT AT THE MARCH 23, 1995 ADMINISTRATIVE COMMITTEE MEETING FOR REVIEW AND SUBSEQUENT SUBMITTAL TO THE FULL BOARD.  THE MOTION WAS SECONDED BY MS. HAGGARD AND PASSED BY A UNANIMOUS VOTE OF THE BOARD MEMBERS PRESENT.  (Absent:  Loveridge and Wilson.)<P>
<P>
<B><U>PUBLIC HEARINGS<P>
</U></B><P>
32.	Amend Rule 2002 - Allocations for Oxides of Nitrogen and Oxides of Sulfur<P>
<P>
	The staff report was given by Anupom Ganguli, Senior Manager/Stationary Source Compliance.  Dr. Ganguli noted that the Statement of Overriding Considerations and Mitigation Monitoring (Attachment 1 to Proposed Amended Rule 2002) had been revised to include language inadvertently omitted by staff.  Revised copies were distributed to Board members and made available to the public.<P>
<P>
	The public hearing was opened, and the Board heard testimony from <B>Pat Fitzgibbon of ARCO's CQC Kiln </B>facility, the only petroleum coke calciner in the South Coast Air Basin.  Speaking in support of the proposed amendment, Mr. Fitzgibbon commended staff for conducting a thorough technical assessment of their facility and agreed with staff that, while ambitious, a 
30 percent emission reduction is possible with urea injection technology.<P>
<P>
	There being no further testimony, the public hearing was closed.<P>
<P>
MS. LEE MOVED ADOPTION OF RESOLUTION NO. 95-3, CERTIFYING THE FINAL SUPPLEMENTAL ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND AMENDING RULE 2002, INCLUDING THE REVISED STATEMENT OF OVERRIDING CONSIDERATIONS AND MITIGATION MONITORING, AS RECOMMENDED BY STAFF.  THE MOTION WAS SECONDED BY 
MR. PAULITZ AND PASSED BY UNANIMOUS CONSENT OF THE BOARD MEMBERS PRESENT.  (Absent:  Antonovich, Loveridge and Wilson.)<P>
<P>
33.	Amend RECLAIM Rule 2011, Appendix A - Protocol Monitoring, Reporting, and Recordkeeping for Oxides of Sulfur (SOx); and Amend RECLAIM Rule 2012, Appendix A - Protocol Monitoring, Reporting, and Recordkeeping for Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx)<P>
<P>
	The staff report was given by Ms. Leyden.  In response to questions and concerns raised by Dr. Burke, she clarified that requiring monitoring and reporting of emissions from standby equipment would not result in replication of emissions reporting.  Ms. Leyden emphasized that the emissions monitoring and reporting requirement is the basic enforcement part of the RECLAIM trading program; and that simply "tagging" standby equipment would not provide AQMD staff a way of verifying that the equipment is not emitting NOx or SOx into the atmosphere.<P>
<P>
(Mr. Loveridge arrived at 11:30 a.m.)<P>
<P>

	The public hearing was opened, and the Board heard testimony from the following individuals:<P>
<P>
JENNIFER COSTANZA, Texaco<P>
ANDREW BRACKER, Western Independent Refiners Association<P>
GLENN LINGLE, Paramount Petroleum<P>
LEE WALLACE, The Gas Company<P>
STAN HOLM, Mobil Oil<P>
RICK ZBUR, Regulatory Flexibility Group		<P>
<P>
	Unanimous support was expressed for the proposed amendments regarding missing data procedures and extending the continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS) requirement six months for Cycle 1 major sources.  The following issues and concerns were raised; not to request Board action, but to make Board members aware that certain implementation problems exist which may, in the future, require further amendment of RECLAIM Rules:<P>
<P>
	Because intermittently-operated units ("standby equipment") are needed on short notice, a facility cannot cut off fuel supplies or otherwise render the equipment inoperable.  At the same time, it seems unfair to require emissions reporting as if those units were operating at 100 percent capacity, 24 hours per day, when the units are actually shut down.<P>
<P>
	Facilities interested in using Alternative CEMS (ACEMS), which may potentially be much less expensive than CEMS, may also need more time.  Currently, the guidance on ACEMS from the AQMD's pilot program is scheduled to be issued on April 15.  However, ACEMS are very complicated systems and the pilot program is the first of its kind.  Therefore, there is some concern that this deadline may not be met.<P>
<P>
	It was suggested that facility operators be given an additional option of either red-tagging standby equipment or having permit conditions that would require the facility to give the AQMD notice before ever operating that equipment.  During those periods of time, missing data provisions would apply, thereby resulting in a more conservative reporting than the CEMS.<P>
<P>
	With respect to non-operating equipment that have CEMS, it was suggested that facility operators be given the option of having the CEMS send a signal to the AQMD indicating that the equipment is not operating, rather than the more costly requirement of having the CEMS operating and reporting zero emissions.<P>
<P>
	Public testimony indicated the willingness of the regulated community to continue to work with AQMD staff to arrive at mutually-agreeable resolution of the issues raised; and, if necessary, for AQMD staff to report back to the Board at a later date with recommendations.<P>
<P>
	There being no further testimony, the public hearing was closed.<P>
<P>
	Mr. Braude commented that when the RECLAIM Rules were adopted, it was understood that a certain amount of fine-tuning would be necessary.  He believed the additional six months recommended by staff was reasonable.  As to the other concerns raised, he hoped that the regulated community would be able to work with staff to achieve the most effective monitoring at the lowest possible cost.  He was sympathetic and supportive of exploration of the suggestions made, but believed the spirit of enforcement must be retained if the AQMD is to fulfill its responsibility of insuring reduction in emissions.<P>
<P>

MR. BRAUDE MOVED ADOPTION OF RESOLUTION NO. 95-5, CERTIFYING THE NOTICE OF EXEMPTION AND AMENDING RECLAIM RULES 2011 AND 2012, AS RECOMMENDED BY STAFF.  THE MOTION WAS DULY SECONDED.<P>
<P>
	In response to Ms. Haggard, Ms. Leyden commented that while staff does meet with refineries on a monthly basis regarding implementation issues and has met individually with each of the applicants involved regarding various appeals; there is not presently a formal, standing working group.  However, there has been discussion on formation of a working group, which staff intends to initiate.  The refinery issues, staff believes, are unique to refineries and are probably best handled in the existing manner, where staff meets with the independent refiners as a group and meets with Western States Petroleum Association as a group.<P>
<P>
	Ms. Haggard was supportive of a working group which involved more than just the refineries in order to insure that the issues raised are resolved before the July 1, 1995 deadline for RECLAIM-certified CEMS.<P>
<P>
THE MOTION BY MR. BRAUDE TO ADOPT RESOLUTION NO. 95-4, CERTIFYING THE NOTICE OF EXEMPTION AND AMENDING RECLAIM RULES 2011 AND 2012, AS RECOMMENDED BY STAFF PASSED BY UNANIMOUS CONSENT OF THE BOARD MEMBERS PRESENT.
(Absent:  Wilson.)<P>
<P>
34.	Amend Rule 1121 - Control of Nitrogen Oxides from Residential Type Natural Gas-Fired Water Heaters<P>
<I><P>
</I>	The staff report was given by Pang Mueller, Senior Manager/Stationary Source Compliance.  After receiving public comments at the February 10, 1995 public hearing on the proposed amendments to Rule 1121, the Board continued the hearing to March 10 and directed staff to conduct further evaluation of the issues and recommendations raised in the public comments.  Staff reviewed the concerns expressed by the public, and recommended that:  (i) Subparagraph (d)(1) be changed to specify emission testing of a single sample of one randomly-selected unit of each model, instead of testing of three samples of each model;  and (ii) Subparagraph (d)(6) be added to the rule, providing an alternative option to recertification every three years.<P>
<P>
	There being no public testimony, the public hearing was closed.<P>
<P>
MS. LEE MOVED ADOPTION OF RESOLUTION NO. 95-5, CERTIFYING THE EXEMPTION FROM CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT REQUIREMENTS AND AMENDING RULE 1121 AS RECOMMENDED BY STAFF.  THE MOTION WAS SECONDED BY MS. SOTO, AND PASSED BY UNANIMOUS CONSENT OF THE BOARD MEMBERS PRESENT.  (Absent:  Wilson.)<P>

			Rule 2015(c)(3) requires that the Executive Officer perform a technology review for petroleum coke calciners.  The review has been completed and the Executive Officer has found that an increase to the year 2000 emission factor is appropriate.  This will result in an increase of approximately 0.21 ton per day in the year 2000 allocation.  To change RECLAIM NOx allocations, the Rule 2002 emission factor for calciners is proposed for amendment from 0.61 to 0.971 pound of NOx per ton of calcined coke.  The necessary CEQA documents will be included in the final Board package.

   December 9, 1994
<P>
South Coast Air Quality<BR>
     Management District Board
<P>
Recommendation Regarding a Request for Proposals<BR>
<U>for the Acquisition of a Scientific Computer</U>
<P>
An integral component in the District's quest for clean air is
the ability to forecast rule impacts.  This forecasting  is made
possible through the use of sophisticated air quality modeling
programs that are run on very powerful scientific computers. 
These modeling programs allow staff to evaluate future air quality
and economic impacts resulting from specific emission control
strategies.  To date, the main modeling program used by the District
is the Urban Airshed Model (UAM).  This model numerically solves
a complex set of chemistry equations to estimate pollutant concentrations
(notably ozone) from emission inputs of nitrogen oxide and reactive
organic gases.  More complex models are currently being developed
to better forecast particulate matter (PM) formation resulting
from the photochemical process.
<P>
Currently, three Multiflow Trace computers are used to run the
UAM.  However, staff is finding these units to be an increasingly
insufficient resource to meet the District's expanded modeling
needs, as these computers utilize seven-year-old technology. 
Moreover, because Multiflow Inc. filed for bankruptcy in 1992,
service/support and replacement parts are difficult to locate.
 The sole remaining service provider, in fact, is located east
of the Mississippi River.
<P>
Even though the Multiflow Trace computers can still run the UAM,
a single, one-day simulation takes approximately eight to ten
hours to complete.  This limits the District to one or two model
runs per day, and thus handicaps management from obtaining the
impact forecasts needed to make informed decisions under tight
rule making schedules.  It also hinders staff's ability to analyze
and respond to public demands for alternative strategies in a
timely fashion.
<P>
Staff believes that  a scientific computer based upon newer computer
technology would be more reliable, easier to maintain, less costly
to operate, and would run District models 5 to 20 times faster
than the current Multiflows.  Staff also believes that a new scientific
computer could be acquired at a cost less than or equal to the
original cost of a single Multiflow Trace computer.
<P>
The attached Request for Proposals (RFP) will allow the District
to identify the vendor with the most competitive scientific computer
hardware, software and maintenance services.  The outcome of the
RFP will be a staff recommendation to enter into a purchase agreement
with the selected vendor for the products and services identified
in the RFP.   $100,000 will be utilized from the current Fiscal
Year 1994-95 budget to fund the purchase of this computer equipment.

<P>
This recommendation was reviewed and approved by the Administrative
Committee on November 17, 1994.
<P>
THEREFORE, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOUR BOARD
<P>
 -- Approve the release of RFP #9495-24 entitled &quot;Request
for Proposals for  Scientific Computer&quot;.  
<P>
  Respectfully,
<P>

<h2>1995-96 Annual Emission Reporting Program</h2>

<BR><img src="/icon/line4.gif" border=0 ></center>

<H3><CENTER>SUBMITTAL DATE: No later than August 30, 1996</CENTER></H3>

<P>The AQMD requires facilities to file Annual Emissions Reports and pay annual fees based on their emission of air contaminants, as noted in <A HREF="http://www.aqmd.gov/rules/html/r301.html">Rule 301</A>, subdivision (e) and subparagraph (o)(10).  As authorized by <A HREF="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=hsc&group=40001-41000&file=40500-40516">State Health and Safety Code Section 40510</A>, the fees help cover costs to evaluate, plan, inspect, and monitor air quality efforts.  In this way, those who emit more, pay more toward our air pollution control efforts -- and at the same time are given an incentive to reduce emissions.  About 40% of this area's air pollution comes from the overall category of stationary sources.</P>
<P>Facilities may use either paper forms or reporting software to submit their 1995-96 Annual Emissions Report.  The data collected is used to update the comprehensive emissions inventory for the AQMD, which includes Los Angeles and Orange counties, the non-desert portion of San Bernardino county, and the Riverside county areas west of the Palo Verde Valley (Blythe).</P>
<P>This annual emissions inventory of pollutants and source categories is essential to effectively design and evaluate clean air strategies to comply with state and federal public health standards.  The compiled inventory is published in each update of the Air Quality Management Plan.</P>
<P>Annual emission fees are assessed on sources which emit:</P>
<P><ul><li> a total of four tons or more per year of sulfur oxides (SOx), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter;
<P><li> more than 100 tons per year of carbon monoxide (CO);
<P><li> toxic air contaminants and ozone-depleting compounds (such as hexavalent chromium, asbestos, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), and 1,1,1,-trichloroethane).</ul>
<P>This package includes information for filing the 1995-96 Annual Emissions Report for the period from July 1, 1995 through June 30, 1996, including:</P>
<P><ul><li> Detailed instructions for all emission forms.
<P> <li> Reporting software for facilities wishing to file the report electronically using the software rather than traditional paper forms.
<P> <li> A General Instruction Book for updated program information, questions &amp; answers, completed form examples, references, schedule of informational workshops, and available support options.
<P> <li> Supplemental Instructions for Above-Ground Storage Tanks.
<P><li> Spreadsheets for calculating Tank Emissions (for External Floating Roof, Internal Floating Roof, and Fixed Roof type tanks).</ul>

<P><A NAME="I3"></A><I><U>Health Advisories To Be Eliminated by 2000</U></I>
<P><A NAME="I4"></A><B>UPDATED AQMD PLAN ASSURES CONTINUED STRIDES TOWARD CLEAN AIR</B>
<P><A NAME="I5"></A>
An updated clean air plan adopted today by the South Coast Air Quality Management District Governing Board keeps the Southland firmly on the road to clean air.
<P> Stage I ozone episodes and carbon monoxide exceedances will be a thing of the past after 1999.  The present standards for fine particulate will be met in 2006 and for ozone in 2010.
<P> The 1997 Air Quality Management Plan was approved by the board unanimously after a public hearing.
<P> &quot;We're making good progress toward clean air while being careful about the impacts of our decisions on jobs and the economy,&quot; said Jon D. Mikels, AQMD's Governing Board chairman.
<P> &quot;Our air is more healthful than ever because our program is scientifically sound and working as expected.  But we need to keep up our effort, particularly in light of tighter health standards that are on the way.&quot;
<P> Adoption of the revised plan comes at the close of the cleanest Southland smog season on record, the fifth year in a row marked by substantial improvement in air quality.  The number of Stage I episode days was cut in half -- from 14 last year to seven this year.
<P> The plan includes 68 pollution control measures to put in place between now and 2010 to assure continued progress toward clean air.  Twenty-nine measures from the 1994 version of the plan that would bring just minimal emission reductions and reduce driving to shopping centers and other facilities were dropped.
<P> This reduces the overall cost of future pollution control requirements by some $3.7 billion a year, from $5.4 billion anticipated in the 1994 plan to just $1.7 billion.  Annual average benefits are estimated to be at least $4.5 billion.
<P> AQMD's revised plan is designed to meet the current standards for carbon monoxide by 2000, fine particle pollution by 2006 and ozone by 2010.  However, the federal EPA may issue new standards for fine particles and ozone next year in light of medical evidence the current standards do not fully protect health.
<P> &quot;If EPA adopts the new standards, we'll need to revisit our plan&quot; Mikels said.  &quot;Meanwhile, we'll continue our progress toward healthful air.&quot;
<P> For example, the current ozone standard of .12 parts per million was exceeded on 87 days this year, almost half as many as ten years ago.  Only seven Stage I episode days -- when ozone exceeds .20 ppm -- were recorded this year compared to 79 in 1986 and 121 in 1977.
<P> The same trend continued with Health Advisories -- issued when ozone levels exceed .15 ppm -- with 52 this year compared to 140 ten years ago.  (For perspective, the highest ozone level recorded in this region was .68 ppm in 1955 compared to .24 ppm this year.)
<P> The plan adopted by the AQMD board today promises to eliminate all Stage I episodes and Health Advisories in just four years.
<P> &quot;The region's progress on air quality proves that our pollution control programs are working,&quot; said James M. Lents, AQMD executive officer.  &quot;It also shows the region must continue to follow through on its drive to clean air.
<P> Special studies costing $1.4 million were carried out to update the data base for the particulate portion of the plan, which also incorporates improved meteorological data and updated forecasts of population, vehicle use and economic activity.
<P> By 2010, the plan will reduce daily emissions of volatile organic compounds from 1,240 tons to 413 tons and nitrogen oxides from 1,194 tons to 530 tons.
<P> Stage I ozone episodes and state Health Advisory days will be eliminated by 2000.  The average range of visibility in Riverside, where fine particle pollution obscures vistas most, will increase from about six miles today to more than eight miles in 2006 and 10 miles in 2010.
<P> The plan outlines measures to control emissions from motor vehicles, households, industries and businesses, and offroad vehicles and equipment used in shipping and construction.  It also highlights programs to commercialize new technologies, such as fuel cells, biofilters and zero-polluting paints and industrial materials.
<P> Next, the California Air Resources Board and federal Environmental Protection Agency must approve the plan.
<P> AQMD is the regional air pollution control agency for Los Angeles, Orange and parts of Riverside and San Bernardino counties.

<P><A NAME="I3"></A><I><U>Measure Will Reduce More Than 10 Tons of VOCs Per Day</U></I>
<P><A NAME="I4"></A><B>AQMD CONSIDERS RULE TO CUT POLLUTION FROM PAINT</B>
<P><A NAME="I5"></A>The Southland's air quality agency will consider a measure this month to significantly reduce smog-forming ingredients in house paints and other architectural coatings.
<P>On Oct. 11, the South Coast Air Quality Management District's Governing Board will consider adopting an amendment to the agency's Rule 1113 to reduce volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from paints by 10.5 tons per day.
<P>Most of the reduction would result from a requirement that flat house paints contain 60% fewer VOCs by 2001, and no more than 50 grams per liter of VOCs by 2008.  The latter will effectively require that flat paints be completely water-based by 2008.
<P>&quot;Many of us already paint our homes with low- or zero-polluting water-based paints,&quot; said James M. Lents, AQMD's executive officer.
<P>&quot;By requiring paint manufacturers to reformulate their products, we can ensure that these clean air products are used throughout Southern California.&quot;
<P>The rule also would require reductions in the VOC content of lacquers, highway and road marking paints and specialty multi-color coatings.
<CENTER><P><B><U>The Pollution In Paint</U></B></CENTER>
<P>Zero-VOC paints are an important tool in the war against smog, since paints for homes and other structures account for 60 tons per day of VOC emissions in the Southland -- considerably more than the 44 tons per day of VOC emissions from all of the region's gas stations and oil refineries.
<P>Petroleum-solvent based paints contain a substantial amount of VOCs, which evaporate as paint dries and combine with nitrogen oxides, a combustion pollutant, to form ozone.  Ozone causes shortness of breath, kills lung cells and is suspected of causing premature aging of the lungs.
<P>VOCs also contribute to the formation of particulate pollution, or PM10, which is linked to as many as 8,000 premature deaths a year in the South Coast Air Basin.
<P>Since homeowners and painting contractors like to paint during good weather, VOC emissions from paint are highest during summer, when ozone pollution is at its worst.
<P>Although the average VOC content of paint has fallen in recent years due to environmental regulations and increased market demand for low-VOC paints, total VOC emissions from house paints are expected to increase in the Southland due to population and housing growth.
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="paint000.gif" ALT="Undisplayed Graphic"></CENTER>
<P>If further measures are not adopted to control so-called &quot;area-wide sources,&quot; of which paints are a major component, they will become the dominant source of VOC emissions by 2010.
<CENTER><P><B><U>Zero-Polluting Paint Now Widely Available</U></B></CENTER>
<P>Traditional petroleum solvent-based paints contain about 50% solvent by volume, and therefore have high VOC emissions.  In 1948, the Glidden Co., now part of ICI Paints, developed latex paint, which contains about 7% solvent and considerably less VOCs than traditional coatings.  In 1992, Glidden introduced the first zero-VOC paint, and the company now offers it in all colors for priming and painting interior surfaces with flat, eggshell or semi-gloss finishes.
<P>Several other manufacturers, including American Formulators Manufacturers, Benjamin Moore Paints, Bruening Paints, Fine Line Paints, Frazee Paints, NonToxiCA, Miller Paint, Republic Paints, Richards Paints and Rodda Paints also make zero-VOC coatings.  ICI Paints, sold through Sinclair, Ameritone and Decratrend stores, as well as NonToxiCA, now market a zero-VOC exterior paint with solvent-free colorants.
<CENTER><P><B><U>The New Age of No-Polluting Paints</U></B></CENTER>
<P>Low- and zero-VOC house paints already are in widespread use throughout the country and the region.  A recent study showed that more than 40% of all flat paint sold in the state complied with AQMD's proposed VOC limits for 2001, and 12% met the agency's final limits proposed for 2008.
<P>In Anaheim, a team of employees at Rockwell has cut 1,500 pounds a year of VOCs by using VOC-free indoor paint.
<P>&quot;We now use no-VOC paints almost daily for all our interior wall painting,&quot; says Dick Clark, Rockwell's manager of environmental compliance.  &quot;The material coats better than traditional paints, has a less offensive odor, creates less costly waste and reduces our VOC emissions from the entire site by 25%.&quot;
<P>Rockwell also found the paint has a faster drying time, increasing productivity by displacing employees from painted areas for shorter periods of time.
<P>Hospitals, movie and television studios and other businesses like the zero-VOC paints because unlike petroleum solvent coatings, they have virtually no odor.
<P>&quot;You can do touch-ups during the day when people are here and you can't smell a thing,&quot; says Diane Morrison, manager of the Gas Company's Energy Resource Center in Downey, a 45,000 square-foot-facility painted inside with no-VOC coatings.
<P>The Gas Company has also used the no-polluting paints at its computer and customer service centers.
<P>No-VOC paint is even used at the Happiest Place On Earth.  Disneyland's facility staff has applied several hundred gallons to interior walls and washrooms.
<CENTER><P><B><U>Proposed Amended Rule 1113 -- Architectural Coatings</U></B></CENTER>
<P>AQMD developed its rule proposal during an eight-month period that included several public workshops and six meetings with an industry working group.  AQMD staff extended the compliance deadlines for flat paints as a result of concerns raised by the working group.
<P>AQMD will conduct technology assessments in 2000 and 2007 for flat coatings, and in 2003 for lacquers to ensure that they can meet the lower VOC requirements.
<P>AQMD is the air pollution control agency for Los Angeles, Orange and portions of San Bernardino and Riverside counties.

<H5>Nov. 8, 1996 </H5>
<HR>

<P><A NAME="I3"></A><A NAME="I4"></A><B>AQMD ADOPTS RULES FOR CLEANER PAINT, VOLUNTARY RIDESHARING</B>
<P><A NAME="I5"></A>The Southland's air quality agency adopted a measure today that will significantly reduce smog-forming ingredients in house paints and other architectural coatings.
<P>In addition, the South Coast Air Quality Management District's Governing Board exempted employers with fewer than 250 employees from its rule requiring them to reduce motor vehicle emissions.
<P><B><U>Cleaner House Paints</U></B>
<P>To clean up paints, the board voted 8 to 1 to amend the agency's Rule 1113 to reduce volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions by 10.3 tons per day.
<P>Most of the reduction would result from a requirement that flat house paints contain 60% fewer VOCs by 2001, and no more than 50 grams per liter of VOCs by 2008.  The latter will effectively require that flat paints be zero-VOC by 2008.
<P>&quot;Low- or zero-polluting water-based paints are already available from a growing number of manufacturers and many of us use them now in our homes,&quot; said James M. Lents, AQMD's executive officer.
<P>&quot;By requiring all paints to meet this standard, we can speed their introduction throughout Southern California and ensure continued progress toward healthful air.&quot;
<P>The rule also will require reductions in the VOC content of lacquers, highway and road marking paints and specialty multi-color coatings.
<P>Zero-VOC paints are an important tool in the war against smog, since paints for homes and other structures account for 60 tons per day of VOC emissions in the Southland -- considerably more than the 44 tons per day of VOC emissions from all of the region's gas stations and oil refineries.
<P>Petroleum-solvent based paints contain a substantial amount of VOCs, which evaporate as paint dries and combine with nitrogen oxides, a combustion pollutant, to form ozone.  Ozone causes shortness of breath, kills lung cells and is suspected of causing premature aging of the lungs.
<P><B><U>Voluntary Ridesharing Approved</U></B>
<P>The board voted to change AQMD's Rule 2202 to comply with a state law which takes effect Jan. 1 to exempt 2,730 Southland work sites with up to 249 employees from motor vehicle emissions reduction requirements.
<P>The new year will launch an 18-month effort to see if voluntary carpooling can achieve equivalent emission reductions.  Regional ridesharing agencies and AQMD will put into place an active voluntary rideshare program.
<P>Until now, Rule 2202 has required some 4,300 area employers of 100 or more employees at a worksite to reduce vehicle emissions through rideshare strategies, old vehicle scrapping or other programs.
<P>The new state law -- based on SB 836 sponsored by state Sen. John Lewis (R-Orange) -- calls for eventual phase out of the mandatory measure if the voluntary approach to ridesharing is as successful in reducing pollution.

September 26, 1996</H5>

<P><hr><p><B>VOLUNTEER COMMITTEE DESIGNS HARBOR DUST MONITORING STUDY</B>
<P>A community action committee working with the South Coast Air Quality Management District staff is designing a dust pollution monitoring and analysis program in the ports area.
<P>The monitoring program will address concerns raised by local residents at a public meeting last month in San Pedro about airborne pollutants from coal and coke piles in the L.A. harbor.
<P>The study will provide targeted sampling in the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles.  At a District-sponsored meeting last week, a community committee decided that sampling will be conducted between May and June 1997 -- a time when meterological conditions are best for particulate sampling.
<P>Coke, stripped from giant cokers used by area refineries to process gasoline, and coal, mined in the Midwest, come through the Los Angeles and Long Beach ports for export to Pacific Rim countries.  The coke arrives by truck and the coal by railcar.
<P>AQMD has completed 19 special particulate monitoring projects in the last eight years in the L.A. Harbor region, either to investigate community complaints, or to determine compliance with air quality regulations.  This represents 50% of all special particulate monitoring conducted by AQMD in Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino and Riverside counties combined.
<P>In addition to the new AQMD particulate study, U.S. Customs has contracted for three background particulate monitoring tests, the results of which they plan to share with the committee.  These tests are now ongoing and results are expected this November.
<P>The goal of the committee is to recommend which sources to test, where to place sampling equipment, to inventory sources and rank areas of contribution, and, finally, to recommend the most appropriate and effective action to abate dust based on the data collected.  A secondary goal is to bring the information back to the community through a series of public outreach actions.
<P>Committee members include Olivia Fernandez, Wilmington resident and member of AQMD's Ethnic Community Advisory Council; Gertrude Schwab, president Wilmington North Neighborhood Association and a former L.A. Harbor commissioner; John Barbieri, director of Committee to Cover LAXT; John Wilks, U.S. Customs; Paul Breul, LB Marina Boatowners Assoc; and Al Garnier, Metropolitan Stevedores.
<P>Representatives of Long Beach City Councilman Alan Lowenthal and Assemblyman Kuykendall (R-Rancho Palos Verdes) attended the kickoff committee meeeting.  
<P>A second committee meeting will be held on November 15.
<P> AQMD is the air pollution control agency for Los Angeles, Orange and portions of San Bernardino and Riverside counties.

<H2><A NAME="intro">INTRODUCTION </A></H2>

<P>
This chapter summarizes emissions occurring in the Basin during
the base years, 1987 and 1990, and emissions projected to occur
in the years 1994, 1996, 1997, 1999, 2000, 2002, 2005, 2007, 2008,
and 2010. These inventory years are selected to comply with the
federal and state Clean Air Act reporting requirements regarding
emission reduction progress. The federal Clean Air Act calls for
1990 as the base year to be used for future emission projections.
The state Clean Air Act requires 1987 as the year to use to project
emission reductions. The Air Resources Board (ARB) working with
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) agreed to the use of
1990 as the base year for all emission projections including reconstructing
1987 for the 1994 AQMP revision.
<P>
The emissions inventory can be divided into four major classifications:
point, area, off-road, and on-road sources. The 1990 base year
point source emissions are based principally on reported data
from facilities. The area source and off-road emissions are estimated
jointly by ARB and the District. The on-road emissions are calculated
using the ARB's official EMFAC7F emission factors and 1990 activity
data. The 1987 inventory was reconstructed/backcast based on the
same general methodology as the 1990 inventory so as to reflect
current knowledge. For example, EMFAC7F was applied to the 1987
vehicle activity data to develop revised 1987 on-road mobile emissions.
This approach provides a more consistent basis for evaluation
of emission reduction progress.
<P>
The future emission forecasts reflect demographic and economic
growth forecasts by the Southern California Association of Governments
(SCAG). The California Energy Commission (CEC) energy forecasts
for the petroleum industry and gas appliance-related categories
incorporating energy efficiency standards are also used to refine
emission projections. In addition, emission reductions resulting
from ARB and District regulations adopted prior to July 31, 1994
are included in the emission forecasts except for on-road mobile
regulations. The rules and regulations adopted since August 1,
1994, are treated as baseline adjustment measures in Chapter 4
to account for their emissions reduction impacts.
<H2><A NAME="inventories">EMISSIONS INVENTORIES </A></H2>

<P>
Baseline emissions data presented in this chapter are based on
average annual day emissions (i.e., total annual emissions divided
by 365 days) and seasonally adjusted planning inventory emissions.
The 1994 AQMP uses annual average day emissions to estimate the
cost-effectiveness of a control measure, to rank control measure
implementation, and for PM10 modeling and analysis. The planning
inventory emissions developed to capture the emission levels during
episodes of poor air quality are used to report emission reduction
progress as required by federal and state Clean Air Acts. Three
planning inventories are prepared for the 1994 AQMP: an ozone
inventory for summer volatile organic compounds (VOC) and oxides
of nitrogen (NO<FONT SIZE=2>x</FONT>) emissions; a carbon monoxide
(CO) inventory for winter CO emissions; and a nitrogen dioxide
(NO<FONT SIZE=2>2</FONT>) inventory for winter NO<FONT SIZE=2>x</FONT>
emissions.
<P>
Detailed descriptions of the base year and future baseline emission
inventories are presented in the following appendices: Appendix
III-A - Current and Future Average Annual Day Emissions in the
South Coast Air Basin; Appendix III-B - Current and Future Planning
Emissions in the South Coast Air Basin; and Appendix III-C - Future-Year
Controlled Planning Emissions in the South Coast Air Basin.
<H3>Stationary Sources </H3>

<P>
Stationary sources can be divided into two major subcategories:
point and area sources. Point sources are generally large emitters
with one or more emission sources at a facility with an identified
location (e.g., power plants, refinery boilers). Area sources
generally consist of many small emission sources (e.g., residential
water heaters, architectural coatings) which are distributed across
the region. Their emissions over a given area may be calculated
using socioeconomic data. For 1987, reported data is used for
point sources emitting more than 8 tons/year of any one of the
criteria air contaminants; for 1990, reported data is used for
2 tons/year or greater sources. For point sources emitting less
than the specified thresholds, data is derived from the District's
permit system data base. In general, the reported emissions tend
to be lower than the estimated values based on permit information.
For area sources, emissions were jointly developed by the ARB
and the District for a total of more than 200 categories. 
<H3>Mobile Sources </H3>

<P>
Mobile sources consist of two subcategories: on-road and off-road
sources. On-road vehicle emissions are calculated using socioeconomic
data and transportation models provided by SCAG, spatial distribution
data from Caltrans' Direct Travel Impact Model (DTIM), and emission
factors (EMFAC7F) obtained from the ARB. The 1990 Census data
is reflected in the SCAG socioeconomic data. Major improvements
made to EMFAC7F include:

<P>
<TT><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="MS LineDraw">&ugrave;</FONT></B></TT>
Implementation of the California Low Emission Vehicle (LEV) and
Clean Fuels regulations.
<P>
Based on the vehicle activity data and EMFAC, ARB uses the BURDEN
model to estimate aggregated on-road emissions by vehicle type/technology
by source category. The on-road emissions presented in this chapter
are based on the BURDEN results. There have been ongoing discussions
among agencies to resolve technical differences between the reported
emissions from DTIM and BURDEN and to determine which model is
appropriate to report emissions for AQMP use. A technical consensus
has been reached among agencies to expand DTIM modeling capabilities
and to use it as the tool for future planning purposes. This upgraded
DTIM model (i.e., DTIM2) will be available in the near future.

<P>
Emissions from off-road vehicle categories (e.g., trains, ships,
utility engines) were calculated as area sources. ARB conducted
a &quot;California Specific Activity Information&quot; study in
1993 to improve the emission estimates on construction equipment,
agricultural equipment, industrial equipment, recreational equipment
(excluding watercraft equipment), and locomotives. 
<H3>Gridded Emissions </H3>

<P>
For air quality modeling purposes, the region is composed of the
South Coast Air Basin, Coachella Valley, Antelope Valley, Ventura
County (upwind area), and Mojave Desert. The modeling area is
divided into a grid system composed of 5 km by 5 km grid cells
defined by Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates. Both
stationary and mobile emissions are allocated to individual grid
cells within this system. In general, the modeling emission data
features episodic-day emissions. Seasonal variations in activity
levels are taken into account in developing gridded stationary
point and area source emissions. Variations in temperature, hours
of operation, speed of motor vehicles, or other factors are considered
in developing gridded motor vehicle emissions. Hence, &quot;gridded&quot;
emissions data used for ozone modeling applications (Chapter 5)
differ from the average annual day or planning inventory emission
data in two respects: 1) the modeling region covers larger geographic
areas than the Basin; 2) emissions represent day-specific instead
of average or seasonal conditions. In the 1994 AQMP, gridded inventories
associated with four episodes have been prepared for air quality
modeling analyses.
<H2><A NAME="base">BASE YEAR EMISSIONS </A></H2>

<H3>Reconstructed 1987 Emission Inventory </H3>

<P>
The 1987 emission inventory is specified by the California Clean
Air Act as the baseline for measuring emission reduction progress.
The 1987 inventory has been revised since the adoption of the
1991 AQMP to reflect improvements in emissions estimates and inventory
methodology; this provides a consistent basis for emission trend
analysis. Most noticeably, a significant change in methodology

Figure 3-1 compares emission levels of the 1987 inventory used
in the 1991 AQMP and the reconstructed 1987 inventory. As expected,
significant increases are noted in the on-road category for VOC
and CO when EMFAC7F is applied to the 1987 vehicle activity data.
More significant increases are noted in the off-road category
for VOC, NO<FONT SIZE=2>x</FONT>, and CO, ranging from 46 percent
to 200 percent. This is primarily due to the use of engine population
instead of fuel throughput to estimate emissions from mobile equipment
(e.g., construction, farm, and industrial equipment). Also, emission
inventory corrections determined through the RECLAIM allocation
process have also been incorporated into the reconstructed 1987
emission inventory.<BR>

Table 3-2 shows the 1990 emission inventory. Figure 3-2 characterizes
relative contributions by stationary and mobile source categories.
Stationary sources are subdivided into point (e.g., chemical manufacturing,
petroleum production, and electric utilities) and area sources
(e.g., architectural coatings, residential water heaters, and
consumer products). Mobile sources consist of on-road (e.g., light-duty
passenger car) and off-road sources (e.g., trains and ships).

of the VOC and 83 percent of the NO<FONT SIZE=2>x</FONT> emissions
for these two ozone-forming pollutants. The on-road mobile category
alone contributes about 50 percent of the VOC and NO<FONT SIZE=2>x</FONT>
emissions and almost 80 percent of the CO emissions to the total
emissions.
<P>
Within stationary sources, point sources contribute one to two
times more NO<FONT SIZE=2>x</FONT> and SO<FONT SIZE=2>x </FONT>emissions
than area sources. However, area sources play a major role in
VOC emissions, emitting almost 70 percent more VOC than point
sources. Furthermore, area sources are the predominant source
(87 percent) of PM10 emissions due to inclusion of travel-related
activity.
<P>
In the mobile source category, emissions from on-road vehicles
are much higher than those from off-road sources for all criteria
pollutants except SO<FONT SIZE=2>x</FONT>. This can be explained
by the fact that the sulfur content in fuels used for off-road
vehicles is relatively higher than those for on-road vehicles.

<P>
Figure 3-3 compares the 1990 inventory with the reconstructed
1987 inventory. As can be seen, slight emission reductions are
shown for all stationary source pollutants due to adopted air
regulations. PM10 emission reductions are due mainly to underestimation
in unpaved road dust emissions which are accounted as part of
the area source category. Existing ARB vehicle regulations result
in some reductions in VOC and CO. Since the off-road category
is not as well regulated, emission growth between 1987 and 1990
is expected.

<H3>Data Development </H3>

<P>
The following target years: 1994, 1996, 1997, 1999, 2000, 2002,
2005, 2007, 2008, and 2010 are the target years for emissions
rate-of-progress estimates under the federal Clean Air Act and
the state Clean Air Act. Due to the adoption of the RECLAIM program
in October 1993, future emissions are divided into RECLAIM and
non-RECLAIM emissions. Future emissions from RECLAIM sources are
estimated based on their initial allocations as specified by District
Rule 2002. As part of District Rule 2015, the future-year emission
factors for six source categories were evaluated to determine
the achievability of NOx emission reduction technologies for each
source category. The technological review is discussed in Chapter
4. The forecasts for non-RECLAIM emissions were derived using:
1) emissions from the 1990 base year; 2) expected controls after
implementation of District and ARB rules adopted prior to July
31, 1994 except for on-road mobile regulations; and 3) emissions
growth in various source categories between the base and future
years. Rules adopted after July 31, 1994 are treated as baseline
adjustment measures for emissions reduction accounting purposes.

<P>
Demographic growth forecasts for various socioeconomic categories
(e.g., population, housing, employment by industries), developed
by SCAG, were used to estimate future emissions. The 1990 Census
data were used to validate the 1990 socioeconomic data and future
growth. Industry growth factors for 1996, 1997, 2000, and 2010
were provided by SCAG. Growth factors for other interim years
were interpolated between key forecast years. CEC-adopted energy
efficiency standards and energy-based forecasts for the petroleum
industry are also used to improve emission forecasts for certain
gas appliance and refinery operation related categories. Table
3-3 summarizes key socioeconomic parameters used in the 1994 AQMP
for emissions inventory development.
<P>
Current forecasts indicate that this region will experience a
population growth of 33 percent by the year 2010 with a 47 percent
increase in vehicle miles traveled (VMT). In the 1991 AQMP, VMT
growth was projected to occur twice as fast as the population
growth (Table 3-4). The somewhat controlled VMT growth projected
in the 1994 AQMP is primarily due to the effect of District Regulation
XV on ridesharing. A comparison between Tables 3-3 and 3-4 shows
that from the 1991 AQMP to this 1994 revision, there is about
a 2-million increase in population and a 26-million mile increase
in VMT forecast for year 2010, representing increases of 10 percent
and 7 percent, respectively.

Emission data by source categories (point, area, on-road mobile
and off-road mobile sources) and by pollutants are presented in
Tables 3-5 through 3-8 for the years 1996, 2000, 2005, and 2010.

Data for the interim years is contained in Appendix III-A and
III-B. Without any additional controls, VOC, NO<FONT SIZE=2>x</FONT>,
and CO emissions are expected to decrease due to existing regulations,
such as the LEV and oxygenated fuel programs, and the RECLAIM
program. Figure 3-4 illustrates the relative contribution to the
2010 inventory by source category. A comparison between Figures
3-2 and 3-4 indicates that the on-road mobile category continues
to be a major contributor to CO and NO<FONT SIZE=2>x</FONT> emissions.
However, due to the adopted LEV regulation, by 2010 on-road mobile
accounts for less than 20 percent of total VOC emissions compared
to 47 percent in 1990.
<H3>Impact of Growth </H3>

<P>
Despite the stringent air quality regulations adopted as of July
31, 1994, baseline emissions of criteria air pollutants will not
decrease appreciably between 1990 and 2010. This is a consequence
of regional growth in population, housing, and motor vehicle use.

<P>
Figure 3-5 shows the effect of regional growth on future average
annual day emissions. If the effects of growth were removed, the
emission reduction benefits of existing rules and regulations
would be more pronounced. 
<P>
The impact of growth on emissions is particularly important in
light of the CAA and CCAA requirements that emission reductions
are calculated based on 1987 and 1990 emissions, respectively.
Increases in emissions caused by growth, therefore, need to be
fully offset in order to meet both Clean Air Act requirements.
<H2><A NAME="uncertain">UNCERTAINTIES IN ON-ROAD VEHICLE EMISSIONS</A>
</H2>

<P>
Emissions reported in this inventory represent the best available
estimates of emission levels but include some degree of uncertainty.
In particular, VOC emissions from current on-road vehicles are
thought to be significantly underestimated. Recent studies (e.g.,
the Southern California Air Quality Study) and field tests sponsored
by ARB indicate that current on-road VOC and CO emissions are
likely much higher than previously estimated. The current EMFAC7F
model, while reflecting significant progress in the subject area,
also recognizes that more work needs to be done. ARB is directing
several ongoing studies to further improve on-road mobile emission
estimates. These studies include assessment of number of daily
vehicle trips, number of trips and trip length associated with
older vehicles, non-Federal Test Procedure (FTP) driving cycles,
number of high emitters, etc. These findings will be incorporated
into the next revision to the EMFAC model (EMFAC7G) to be released
in early 1995. However, most recent preliminary study results
indicate that if EMFAC7G is used to estimate the 1990 on-road
vehicle emissions, the planning inventory could increase by about
56 percent and 70 percent for VOC and CO, respectively and NO<FONT SIZE=2>x</FONT>
could increase by about 7 percent. Figure 3-6 illustrates what
revised 1990 inventory by pollutants would be based on the preliminary
EMFAC7G <BR>

adjustment factors, and the relative contribution by source category.
There would be approximately 390 tons/day more VOC and 4,300 tons/day
more CO from on-road mobile sources for 1990, with a corresponding
10 percent increase in their contribution to total emissions.
<P>
A separate assessment of the potential impact of the increased
emissions on the attainment demonstration is described in Chapter
5 and Appendix V-A.
<P>
Although current year on-road mobile emissions may be underestimated,
it is not certain whether the same underestimations apply to future
year on-road mobile emissions. Much of the underestimations are
due to the assumption of the number of trips per day and the use
of older vehicles which have higher emission standards. The older
vehicles will eventually retire from service. The introduction
of newer vehicles would reduce a significant portion of the underestimation.
<P>
Based on the most recent EMFAC7G preliminary data for the year
2010 the overall on-road VOC emissions will increase by about
25 percent, as compared to a 56 percent increase in 1990.<P>

<H2><A NAME="purpose">PURPOSE </A></H2>

<P>
The purpose of the 1994 Revision to the Air Quality Management
Plan (AQMP or Plan) for the South Coast Air Basin (Basin) and
those portions of the Southeast Desert Air Basin under South Coast
Air Quality Management District (District) jurisdiction, is to
set forth a comprehensive program that will lead these areas into
compliance with all federal and state air quality standards. In
addition, the 1994 AQMP Revision is designed to satisfy: 1) the
State Implementation Plan requirements under Title I of the federal
Clean Air Act (CAA) and 2) the California Clean Air Act (CCAA).
These federal and state requirements are summarized briefly later
in this chapter.
<P>
The 1994 AQMP sets forth programs which require the cooperation
of all levels of government: local, regional, state, and federal.
Each level is represented in the Plan by the appropriate agency
or jurisdiction that has the authority over specific emissions
sources. Accordingly, each agency or jurisdiction is assigned
specific planning and implementation responsibilities.
<P>
At the federal level, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) is charged with regulation of on-road motor vehicle standards;
trains, airplanes, and ships; non-road engines; and off-shore
oil development. The Air Resources Board (ARB), representing the
state level, also oversees on-road vehicle emission standards,
fuel specifications, some off-road sources and consumer product
standards. At the regional level, the District is responsible
for stationary sources and some mobile and indirect sources. In
addition, the District has lead responsibility for the development
and adoption of the Plan. Lastly, at the local level, Associations
of Governments have a dual role of leader and coordinator. In
their leadership role, they, in cooperation with local jurisdictions
and subregional associations, develop strategies for these jurisdictions
to implement; as a coordinator, they facilitate the implementation
of these strategies. For the South Coast Air Basin the Southern
California Association of Governments is the District's major
partner in the preparation of the AQMP. Interagency commitment
and cooperation are the keys to success of the AQMP. 
<P>
Since air pollution physically transcends city and county boundaries,
it is a regional problem. No one agency can design or implement
the Plan alone, and the strategies in the Plan reflect this fact.
<H1><A NAME="constraints"><FONT SIZE=4>CONSTRAINTS IN ACHIEVING
STANDARDS </FONT></A></H1>

<P>
The District is faced with a number of constraints or confounding
circumstances to achieving clean air. These include the physical
and meteorological setting, the large pollutant emissions burden
of the Basin, and the rapid population growth of the area.
<H3>Setting<FONT SIZE=5> </FONT></H3>

<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District has jurisdiction
over approximately 12,000 square miles consisting of the four-county
South Coast Air Basin and the Los Angeles county and Riverside
county portions of the Southeast Desert Air Basin (SEDAB). Figure
1-1 shows the boundaries of the District; also shown are the federally
designated nonattainment areas. The Basin is bounded by the Pacific
Ocean to the west and the San Gabriel, San Bernardino, and San
Jacinto Mountains to the north and east. It includes all of Orange
county and the nondesert portions of Los Angeles, Riverside, and
San Bernardino counties. The Los Angeles county portion of the
Southeast Desert Air Basin (known as North county or Antelope
Valley) is bounded by the San Gabriel Mountains to the south and
west, the Los Angeles/Kern county border to the north, and the
Los Angeles/San Bernardino county border to the east. The Riverside
county portion of the Southeast Desert Air Basin is bounded by
the San Jacinto Mountains in the west and spans eastward up to
the Palo Verde Valley. The federal nonattainment area (known as
the Coachella-San Jacinto Planning Area) is a subregion of the
portion of Riverside county and the Southeast Desert Air Basin
that is bounded by the San Jacinto Mountains to the west and the
eastern boundary of the Coachella Valley to the east.<BR>

<P>
<IMG SRC="ch1f1.gif">
<CENTER><B>FIGURE 1-1</B></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER>Boundaries of the South Coast Air Quality Management District</CENTER>
<P>
The topography and climate of Southern California combine to make
the Basin an area of high air pollution potential, and constrain
the District's efforts to achieve clean air. During the summer
months, a warm air mass frequently descends over the cool, moist
marine layer produced by the interaction between the ocean's surface
and the lowest layer of the atmosphere. The warm upper layer forms
a cap over the cool marine layer and inhibits the pollutants in
the marine layer from dispersing upward. In addition, light winds
during the summer further limit ventilation. Furthermore, sunlight
triggers the photochemical reactions which produce ozone, and
this region experiences more days of sunlight than any other major
urban area in the nation except Phoenix.
<P>
The Basin's economic base is diverse. Historically, the four counties
of the Basin have collectively comprised one of the fastest-growing
local economies in the United States. Up until recently, the aerospace
and electronic industries accounted for about 20 percent of the
Basin's employment. Significant changes have occurred in the composition
of the industrial base of the region in the past ten years. As
in many areas of the country, a large segment of heavy manufacturing,
including steel and tire manufacturing and automobile assembly,
has been phased down. The aerospace and electronics industries
have been reduced in scale by cutbacks in defense spending. Small
service industries and businesses resulting from growth in shipping
and trade have replaced much of the heavy industry.
<P>
Both the Antelope Valley and the Coachella-San Jacinto Planning
Area are impacted by pollutant transport from the South Coast
Air Basin. In addition, pollutant transport occurs to the Mojave
Desert, Ventura county, and San Diego county. As part of this
AQMP revision, transport issues relative to the Antelope Valley
and the Coachella-San Jacinto Planning Area are specifically addressed
in Chapter 8 and Appendices I-A and I-B.
<P>
In summary, the diverse geographical characteristics of the Southern
California region place a significant constraint on achieving
air quality standards.
<H3>Emission Sources<FONT SIZE=5> </FONT></H3>

<P>
The pollution burden of the Basin is substantial. It has been
estimated from prior studies that emissions of volatile organic
compounds and oxides of nitrogen in the South Coast Air Basin
must be reduced by 80 to 90 percent to attain the federal ozone
standard. Table 1-1 compares the emission inventory for the Basin
with two other air basins with high population densities -- the
San Diego and San Francisco Bay Area air basins. Note that the
daily emissions in the South Coast Air Basin are nearly double
that of the San Francisco Bay Area Air Basin and more than three
times that of the San Diego Air Basin.

<P>
Air pollution forms either directly or indirectly from pollutants
emitted from a variety of sources. These sources can be natural,
such as oil seeps, vegetation, or windblown dust. Emissions may
also result from combustion, as in automobile engines; from evaporation
of organic liquids, such as those used in coating and cleaning
processes; or through abrasion, such as from tires on roadways.
The air pollution control strategy in the AQMP is directed almost
entirely at controlling man-made sources. Where naturally occurring
emissions can be mitigated, such as through windbreaks, they are
included. Otherwise, natural emissions are accounted for in the
background and initial conditions data used for the air quality
modeling analysis described in Chapters 5 and 8; Appendix I-A,
I-B, and V-A; and Technical Reports V-A and V-B.
<H3>Population<FONT SIZE=5> </FONT></H3>

<P>
Since the end of World War II, the Basin has experienced faster
population growth than the rest of the nation. Although growth
is slowing somewhat, the region's population is expected to increase
significantly towards the end of the century and through 2010.
Table 1-2 shows the projected growth based on SCAG's regional
growth forecast.
<P>
Although per-capita emissions have been brought down substantially
in the Basin through 40 years of implementing pollution controls,
increases in the population over that time have made overall emission
reductions more difficult. Many sources, such as automobiles,
have been significantly controlled. However, increases in the
number of sources, particularly those growing proportionally to
population, reduce the potential air quality benefits of new controls.
The net result is that unless significant steps are taken to further
control air pollution, growth will overwhelm much of the improvements
expected from the existing control program.

<H2><A NAME="control">CONTROL EFFORTS </A></H2>

<H3>History </H3>

<P>
The seriousness of the local air pollution problem was recognized
in the early 1940s. In 1946, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors
established the first air pollution control district in the nation
to address the problems of industrial air pollution. In the mid-1950s,
California established the first state agency to control motor
vehicle emissions. Countywide or regional air pollution districts
were required throughout the state by 1970. Many of the controls,
originating in California, became the basis for the federal control
program which began in the 1960s.
<P>
Nearly all control programs developed to date have relied on the
development and application of cleaner technology and add-on emission
control devices. Industrial and vehicular sources have been significantly
affected by this technology. Only recently have preventive efforts
come to the forefront of the air pollution control program, [e.g.,
alternative materials, waste, minimization, and maintenance procedures
for industrial sources].
<P>
In the 1970s, it became apparent at both the state and federal
levels that local programs were not enough to solve a problem
that was regional in nature and did not stay within jurisdictional
boundaries. Instead, air basins, defined by geographical boundaries,
became the basis for regulatory programs.
<P>
In 1976, the California Legislature adopted the Lewis Air Quality
Management Act which created the South Coast Air Quality Management
District from a voluntary association of air pollution control
districts in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, and San Bernardino
counties. The new agency was charged with developing uniform plans
and programs for the region to attain federal standards by the
dates specified in federal law. The agency was also mandated to
meet state standards by the earliest date achievable, using reasonably
available control measures.
<P>
Rule development in the 1970's and 1980's resulted in dramatic
improvement in Basin air quality (see Appendix II-B). However,
the effort to impose incremental rule changes on the thousands
of stationary sources under District permits was laborious and
time consuming. The District concluded it was possible that the
limits of the command and control regulatory process were being
reached. The 1991 AQMP introduced the concept of a Marketable
Permits Program and outlined the skeleton of an idea that was
forerunner to what is now known as the Regional Clean Air Incentives
Market (RECLAIM).
<P>
A historical milestone occurred recently with the adoption of
RECLAIM on October 15, 1993. RECLAIM is an alternative means of
achieving further emission reductions from stationary sources,
different from the traditional source-specific regulatory program.
RECLAIM calls for declining mass emission limits on the total
emissions from all sources within a facility. The facility can
choose from a selection of methods for achieving the prescribed
emission reductions: add-on controls, use of reformulated products,
changes in production, purchase of excess emission reductions
from other sources, and/or any other methods that would be enforceable
and quantifiable. At the time of adoption, RECLAIM was estimated
to affect approximately 390 and 41 of the largest emitters of
oxides of nitrogen and oxides of sulfur in the Basin and is designed
to reduce emissions of these pollutants by 80 and 14 tons/day,
respectively, by July 1, 2004.<SUP>1</SUP>
<H3>Impact of Control<FONT SIZE=5> </FONT></H3>

<P>
Past air quality programs have been effective in improving the
Basin's air quality. Ozone levels have been reduced in half over
the past 30 years, sulfur dioxide and lead standards have been
met, and other criteria pollutant concentrations have significantly
declined. And for the first time in 1992, the federal annual nitrogen
dioxide standard was not exceeded in the Basin. However, the Basin
still experiences exceedances of health-based standards for ozone,
nitrogen dioxide (1-hour), carbon monoxide, and particulate matter
under ten microns (PM10). Air quality trends in the Basin are
briefly discussed in Chapter 2; Appendix II-B provides an in-depth
trend analysis over the 17-year period from 1976 to 1992.
<H2><A NAME="aqmp1991">1991 AQMP<FONT SIZE=6> </FONT></A></H2>

<P>
In July 1991, the District and SCAG adopted an Air Quality Management
Plan for the Basin which revised the 1989 AQMP. The 1991 AQMP
continued an aggressive emission control program using the three-tiered
format that was established by the 1989 AQMP. Tier I are measures
with known, available control technologies. Tier II measures are
based on control technologies foresee to occur around the year
2000. Tier III measures required the advancement of technologies
after 2000. The 1991 AQMP proposed a comprehensive set of control
measures that included the use of advanced technologies for stationary
and mobile sources. The tiered strategy planned for adoption of
most control measures within several years after the Plan approval,
while others required more time due to the need for advances or
breakthroughs in technology.
<P>
An Amendment to the 1991 AQMP was adopted by the District in July
1992. The Amendment incorporated the concepts of RECLAIM into
the existing Marketable Permits Program control measure (Measure
No. P-F-3) originally proposed in the 1991 AQMP.
<P>
The 1991 AQMP and its Amendment addressed CCAA requirements and
included several improvements over previous plans. One of the
most significant advancements in the 1991 AQMP over the 1989 AQMP
was that the on-road mobile source control strategy was moved
from Tier III to Tier I through the state's adoption of the Low
Emissions Vehicle (LEV) program. Other enhancements were made
to the emission inventory and modeling analyses. The enhanced
emissions inventory included biogenic emissions, specific studies
on locomotive and aircraft emissions, and the adding of emissions
for the Coachella Valley to the database. Modeling enhancements
increased the certainty in future air quality projections with
and without further controls.
<H3>Progress in Implementing the 1991 AQMP<FONT SIZE=5> </FONT>
</H3>

<P>
Progress in implementing the 1991 AQMP can be measured by the
number of control measures that have been adopted as rules and
the resulting tons of pollutants targeted for reduction. Since
1991, 21 control measures have been adopted by the District through
December 31, 1993, producing total emission reductions of 47,
71, 10, and 74 tons/day of volatile organic compounds, oxides
of nitrogen, oxides of sulfur, and PM10, respectively. Table 1-3
lists the District stationary source control measures that were
adopted through December 31, 1993. Additional rules have been
adopted by the ARB to further reduce mobile source emissions.
For example, the Phase 2 reformulated fuels program is projected
to reduce Basin-wide volatile organic compounds, oxides of nitrogen,
carbon monoxide, and oxides of sulfur emissions by 42, 25, 439,
and 10 tons/day, respectively, by the year 2000.<SUP>2</SUP>
<P>
Local governments are to play an active role in reducing mobile
source emissions through the implementation of specific actions.
The 1991 AQMP included eight transportation control measures (TCMs)
which were developed by SCAG for local government implementation
to reduce vehicle miles traveled and vehicle trips.
<P>
These TCMs were combined, at the request of local governments,
into a single measure (Control Measure FC-4) in the 1992 Carbon
Monoxide Plan. Along with this consolidated measure was a menu
of 14 actions which local governments could implement to reduce
mobile source emissions. These actions were described and quantified
in the Trip Reduction Ordinance Handbook, a guidance document
developed by the District to assist local governments in crafting
trip reduction programs.
<P>
In June 1992, information was collected regarding the implementation
of these 32 TCM actions and any other TCM actions being administered
at the local level. Over 90 percent of the local governments provided
information on commitments to implement certain actions that would
result in the reduction of vehicle trips and vehicle miles traveled,
as well as emissions. These local government efforts will have
a profound impact on improving air quality in the region. Implementing
action at the local level provides cities and counties with tailored
plans that fit the needs of each individual community.
<H3>Global Warming and Stratospheric Ozone Depletion Policy<FONT SIZE=5>
</FONT></H3>

<P>
On April 6, 1990, the District adopted a &quot;Policy on Global
Warming and Stratospheric Ozone Depletion&quot;. The Policy commits
the District to consider global impacts in rulemaking and in drafting
revisions to the AQMP. 
<P>
In March of 1992, the District's Governing Board reaffirmed this
policy and adopted amendments to the policy to include the following
directives:
<P>
phase out the use and corresponding emissions of chlorofluorocarbons
(CFCs), methyl chloroform (1,1,1-trichloroethane or TCA), carbon
tetrachloride, and halons by December 1995;
<P>
phase out the large quantity use and corresponding emissions of
hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) by the year 2000;
<P>
develop recycling regulations for HCFCs;
<P>
develop an emissions inventory and control strategy for methyl
bromide; and
<P>
support for the adoption of a California greenhouse gas emission
reduction goal.
<P>
In support of these policies, the District Governing Board has
adopted several rules to reduce ozone depleting compounds. Several
other rules concurrently reduce global warming gases and criteria
pollutants. These policies will be further implemented as part
of the 1994 AQMP within the constraints of the resources of the
District.
<H3>Toxic Air Contaminant Control Programs<FONT SIZE=5> </FONT>
</H3>

<P>
The District is also developing and implementing rules to control
Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPs). These control programs have been
designed to meet federal and state requirements. The District
is requested to develop such programs under federal and state
law. 
<P>
At the federal level, Title III of the Clean Air Act provides
a program for the control of 189 HAPs. The first stage of the
program involves the promulgating of NESHAPs to reduce HAP emissions
from new and existing sources. Major sources will be required
to implement Maximum Available Control Technology (MACT). Area
sources will be required to implement general achievable control
technology (GACT). This will be followed by a second phase in
which residual risk will be evaluated and further controls considered.

<P>
The District will implement the NESHAPs MACT (including the standards)
through its Title V permitting program. Thirty-eight MACTs are
scheduled to be promulgated this year. The District is currently
evaluating its existing rules to determine whether they need to
be amended to meet these MACT standards, or whether new rules
need to be developed. 
<P>
At the state level, the California state legislature has enacted
several programs directed at toxic air contaminants (TACs). These
programs include the Tanner Toxics Act (AB 1807), Air Toxics Hot
Spots Assessment Program (AB 2588), Toxic Emissions Near Schools
Program (AB 3205), and Disposal Site Air Monitoring Program (AB
3374). These programs are currently being implemented by the District
either through the District rulemaking, permitting, monitoring
or AB 2588 program. 
<P>
The AB 1807 program, in particular, requires ARB to adopt air
toxic control measures (ATCMs) to reduce levels of exposure and
the risks associated with those levels. At present, the District
has developed and is implementing 7 rules that control emissions
from specific sources of TACs. These rules meet and in some instances
exceed the requirements set forth in the ATCM. The District will
continue to implement this program through new rulemaking as ARB
adopts additional ATCMs. 
<H2><A NAME="aqmp1994">1994 AQMP REVISION<FONT SIZE=6> </FONT></A>
</H2>

<P>
As mentioned earlier in this chapter, this 1994 Revision to the
AQMP is designed to satisfy the planning requirements of both
the Federal Clean Air Act and the California Clean Air Act. These
requirements are discussed below.
<H3>Federal Clean Air Act Planning Requirements<FONT SIZE=5> </FONT>
</H3>

<P>
In November 1990, Congress enacted a series of amendments to the
Clean Air Act intended to intensify air pollution control efforts
across the nation. One of the primary goals of the 1990 Clean
Air Act Amendments was an overhaul of the planning provisions
for those areas not currently meeting National Ambient Air Quality
Standards (NAAQS). The CAA identifies specific emission reduction
goals, requires both a demonstration of reasonable further progress
and an attainment demonstration, and incorporates more stringent
sanctions for failure to attain or to meet interim milestones.
The discussion that follows briefly presents the general planning
requirements of the CAA, lists previous State Implementation Plan
(SIP) submittals, and introduces CAA provisions that are addressed
in the 1994 AQMP.
<H3>General Requirements<FONT SIZE=5> </FONT></H3>

<P>
In general, the federal CAA does not necessitate significant changes
in attainment planning for the Basin. The CAA requires plans to
provide for the implementation of all reasonably available control
measures &quot;as expeditiously as practicable,&quot; including
the adoption of reasonably available control technology for reducing
emissions from existing sources. Emission control innovations
in the form of market-based approaches are explicitly encouraged
by the CAA. As mentioned earlier, the District is the first local
agency in the country to adopt a market-based approach for controlling
stationary source emissions of oxides of nitrogen and sulfur.
As is shown in Chapters 4 and 7, the District is proposing additional
market-based control measures. The CAA also requires plans to
include standards for reasonable further progress, which is defined
as annual incremental reductions in emissions of relevant air
pollutants needed to ensure attainment of the National Ambient
Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) by the applicable date. A similar
demonstration of progress was instituted in California with the
passage of the California Clean Air Act in 1988. This is discussed
further later in this chapter.
<P>
There are several sets of general planning requirements, both
for nonattainment areas [Section 172(c)] and for implementation
plans in general [Section 110(a)(2)]. These requirements are listed
and very briefly described in Tables 1-4 and 1-5, respectively.
The general provisions apply to all applicable pollutants unless
superseded by pollutant-specific requirements.
<P>
Section 110(a)(2)(A) requires reasonable and enforceable control
measures in plans. EPA has interpreted this requirement to imply
that control measures in a plan be in regulatory form (i.e., adopted
rules) at the time of the plan submittal. However, EPA has the
authority to conditionally approve a plan revision based on a
commitment to adopt specific enforceable measures by not later
than one year after the date of conditional approval of the plan
revision [Section 110(k)(4)].

</TABLE>

<P>
EPA guidance<SUP>3</SUP> states that regulatory programs tend
to be less than 100 percent effective for many source categories.
Rule effectiveness reflects the ability of a regulatory program
to achieve all the emission reductions that could be achieved
by full compliance with the applicable regulations at all sources
at all times. An effectiveness factor of 80 percent is required
by EPA for all stationary source and non-tailpipe mobile source
control measures for the future controlled scenarios. EPA, however,
does allow exceptions to this rule if data exists to adequately
demonstrate that the &quot;real world&quot; control percentage
is higher. It should be noted that stationary point source controls
are nearly 100 percent effective so an assumption of 80 percent
rule effectiveness underestimates the expected emission reductions.
<P>
The CAA requires that most submitted plans include information
on tracking plan implementation and milestone compliance. Requirements
for these elements are described in Section 182(g) and Section
187(d) for ozone and carbon monoxide, respectively. Chapter 7
addresses these issues.
<P>
EPA also requires a public hearing on many of the required elements
in SIP submittals before considering them officially submitted.
The 1994 AQMP adoption process includes a public hearing on all
of the required elements prior to submittal.
<H3>Previous Submittals </H3>

<P>
The CAA prescribes an aggressive schedule for SIP submittals.
Table 1-6 lists the SIP submittals required from May 1991 through
November 1993. The District and ARB have a good record for providing
the required submittals in the allotted time frame. The Basin
has been able to comply with all key actions required under Title
I.
<P>
As shown in Table 1-6, previous CAA submittals for the Basin include
the Federal Attainment Plans for Nitrogen Dioxide<SUP>4</SUP>
and Carbon Monoxide,<SUP>5</SUP> submitted in 1992, and the Federal
Reactive Organic Compounds Rate-of-Progress Plan,<SUP>6</SUP>
submitted in November 1993 and amended in March 1994. The 1994
AQMP Revision includes amendments to these federal plans incorporating
a more recent and improved emissions inventory and an up-to-date
control strategy. Revisions to the Federal Carbon Monoxide Plan
and the Federal Reactive Organic Compounds Rate-of-Progress Plan
are contained in Appendices I-E and I-F, respectively, with the
results summarized in Chapters 5 and 6. Chapter 5 also contains
future nitrogen dioxide air quality projections. The overall control
strategy is used to demonstrate attainment of the federal nitrogen
dioxide standard and updates the Nitrogen Dioxide Plan submitted
to EPA in 1992.

<P>
As specified in Section 182(c)(2) of the Act, the ozone attainment
and the post-1996 rate-of-progress demonstrations are due November
15, 1994, and according to Section 189(b)(2) the PM10 BACM SIP
is due August 8, 1994. The 1994 AQMP is designed to satisfy the
requirements of all three of these CAA provisions.
<P>
Section 181(a)(1) classifies the Basin as an extreme nonattainment
area and states that the Basin must achieve the federal ozone
standard by November 15, 2010. As such, an attainment demonstration
for ozone is required. The ozone attainment demonstration contained
here follows EPA and ARB modeling guidelines and as such is based
on the photochemical grid model called the Urban Airshed Model
(UAM). The model evaluation and attainment demonstration are fully
presented in Technical Report V-B and Appendix V-A, respectively,
and summarized in Chapters 5 and 6.
<P>
According to Section 182(c)(2)(B), the District must demonstrate
how the Basin will achieve actual volatile organic compound emission
reductions of at least three percent per year averaged over each
consecutive three-year period beginning from November 15, 1996
and ending November 15, 2010 (i.e., the Basin's attainment date).
The rate-of-progress milestone years for the Basin are 1999, 2002,
2005, 2008, and 2010. Section 182(c)(9) requires that the post-1996
rate-of-progress demonstration must contain a set of contingency
measures, that is, additional control measures which would be
implemented in the event of a milestone or attainment failure.
Appendix I-C contains the detailed calculations of the post-1996
rate-of-progress demonstration and a list of the contingency measures.
Chapter 6 provides an estimation of the emission levels at each
of the milestone years compared to the CAA target levels. Contingency
measures are given in Chapter 8.
<P>
In February 1993, EPA redesignated the Basin and the Coachella
Valley from moderate to serious nonattainment for PM10. This redesignation
was necessary because the 1991 AQMP indicated that the implementation
of reasonably available control measures (RACM) for fugitive dust
would not ensure attainment of the PM10 NAAQS by the CAA deadline
of December 31, 1994. Under the redesignation, the District is
required to prepare and adopt a plan for PM10 which incorporates
best available control measures (BACM) for fugitive dust sources.
Section 189(b)(2) requires the District to submit the PM10 BACM
SIP no later than August 8, 1994. Appendix I-D contains the District's
PM10 BACM SIP for the South Coast Air Basin; the best available
control measures for fugitive dust are also listed in Chapter
7. The PM10 BACM SIP for Coachella Valley was developed separately
from the AQMP. Although an attainment demonstration is not required
until 1997 [Section 189(b)(2)], a modeling analysis is performed
to address the need for PM10 precursor emission controls in order
to achieve PM10 air quality standards. The modeling is described
in Technical Report V-C and summarized in Chapter 5.
<H3>State Law Requirements<FONT SIZE=5> </FONT></H3>

<P>
The California Clean Air Act (CCAA) was signed into law on September
30, 1988, became effective on January 1, 1989, and was amended
in 1992. Also known as the Sher Bill (AB 2595), the CCAA established
a legal mandate to achieve health-based state air quality standards
at the earliest practicable date. The Lewis Presley Act provides
that the plan must also contain deadlines for compliance with
all state ambient air quality standards and the federally mandated
primary ambient air quality standards [Health and Safety Code
(H&amp;SC) 40462(a)]. Through its many requirements, the CCAA
serves as the centerpiece of the Basin's attainment planning efforts
since it is generally more stringent than the federal Clean Air
Act.
<P>
Based on pollutant levels, the CCAA divides nonattainment areas
into categories with progressively more stringent requirements
(H&amp;SC 40918-40920). The categories are outlined in Table 1-8.
However, the only classification categories for nitrogen dioxide
are attainment and nonattainment.
<P>
The Basin is an extreme nonattainment area for ozone and a serious
nonattainment area for carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide. Although
fine particulate matter (PM10) is not explicitly addressed in
the CCAA, it is governed by the Lewis Presley Act. The plan therefore
provides achieving all federal ambient air quality standards by
their applicable date and state ambient air quality standards
as early as possible. The Basin is nearing attainment for sulfates
and has met attainment goals for all other state ambient air quality
standards.

<P>
Serious and above nonattainment areas are required to revise their
air quality management plan to include specified emission reduction
strategies, and to meet milestones in implementing emission controls
and achieving more healthful air quality. The key planning requirements
are provided in Table 1-9. Some of these requirements are discussed
in further detail in the next section. Chapter 6 addresses how
these requirements are met in the Basin. The CCAA also includes
some additional requirements that can significantly affect control
strategy selection. These requirements are provided in Table 1-10.
<P>
All of these mandates have either already been met through District
regulations or are included in the 1994 AQMP.
<H3>Plan Effectiveness </H3>

<P>
The CCAA requires, beginning on December 31, 1994 and every three
years thereafter, that each district demonstrate the overall effectiveness
of its air quality program. The Act suggests a number of air quality
indicators, including actual emission reductions, ozone and carbon
monoxide design value improvements, population exposure reductions,
and pollutant concentration hours. In Chapter 6, plan effectiveness
is illustrated by trends in the following indicators:
<P>
volatile organic compound, oxides of nitrogen, and carbon monoxide
emissions,
<P>
nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, and ozone air quality (i.e.,
exceedance days), and
<P>
nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, and ozone populational exposure
above air quality standards.

In addition, air quality trends in the Basin over the last 17
years are presented and discussed in detail in Appendix II-B.
<H3>Emission Reductions </H3>

<P>
According to the CCAA, districts must design their air quality
management plan to achieve a reduction in basinwide emissions
of five percent or more per year (or 15 percent or more in a three-year
period) for each nonattainment pollutant or its precursors (H&amp;SC
40914). However, an air basin may use an alternative emission
reduction strategy which achieves a reduction of less than 5 percent
per year if it can be demonstrated that either of the following
applies:
<P>
The alternative emission reduction strategy is equal to or more
effective than the 5 percent per year control approach in improving
air quality; or
<P>
That despite the inclusion of every feasible measure, and an expeditious
adoption schedule, the air basin is unable to achieve the 5 percent
per year reduction in emissions.

</TABLE>

<P>
For emission reduction accounting purposes, the ARB has established
a seven-year initial reporting period from January 1, 1988, to
December 31, 1994 (Section 70701 of the California Code of Regulations).
The reporting intervals after this initial period occur every
three years (i.e., 1997, 2000, etc.). Therefore, the 1994 AQMP
must seek to achieve a 35 percent emissions reduction for the
initial reporting period and a 15 percent additional reduction
for every subsequent interval.
<H3>Population Exposure </H3>

<P>
The CCAA also requires that the 1994 AQMP control measures reduce
overall population exposure to criteria pollutants. Specifically,
exposure to severe nonattainment pollutants above standards must
be reduced from 1987 levels by at least 25 percent by December
31, 1994; 40 percent by December 31, 1997; and 50 percent by December
31, 2000. Reductions are to be calculated based on per-capita
exposure and the severity of exceedances. This provision is applicable
to ozone, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen dioxide in the Basin [H&amp;SC
40920(e)]. The definition of exposure is the number of persons
exposed to a specific pollutant concentration level above the
state standard times the number of hours. The per-capita exposure
is the population exposure (units of pphm-persons-hours) divided
by the total population.
<H3>Control Measure Ranking </H3>

<P>
The CCAA requires the District Governing Board to determine that
the AQMP is a cost-effective strategy that will achieve attainment
of the state standards by the earliest practicable date (H&amp;SC
40913). In addition, the Plan must include an assessment of the
cost-effectiveness of available and proposed measures and a list
of the measures ranked from the least cost-effective to the most
cost-effective [H&amp;SC 40922(a)].
<P>
In addition to the relative cost-effectiveness of the measures,
the District must consider other factors as well in developing
an adoption and implementation schedule [H&amp;SC 40922(b)]. The
other factors noted in the CCAA include technological feasibility,
emission reduction potential, rate of reduction, public acceptability,
and enforceability. Efficiency, equity, and legal authority have
also been included in the 1994 AQMP for prioritization purposes
because of their importance. The results of the prioritization
are given in Chapter 6.
<H3>Pollutant Transport </H3>

<P>
The South Coast Air Basin both transports to and receives air
pollutants from the coastal portions of Ventura and Santa Barbara
counties in the South Central Coast Air Basin. The South Coast
Air Basin also receives air pollutants from oil and gas development
operations on the outer continental shelf. The 1994 AQMP does
not specifically address the control requirements for these adjacent
areas. However, the control measures in this Plan meet both the
CAA and CCAA transport requirements and will assist downwind areas
in complying with the federal ozone air quality standard.
<P>
The Antelope Valley and the Coachella Valley are both classified
as &quot;severe-17&quot; nonattainment areas under the CAA. The
San Bernardino county portion of the Mojave Desert is under the
jurisdiction of the Mojave Desert Air Quality Management District
(MDAQMD) and is also classified as &quot;severe-17.&quot; These
areas must comply with the federal ozone air quality standard
by 2007. The CAA requires separate attainment and post-1996 rate-of-progress
demonstrations for each severe air basin under the District's
jurisdiction. These are provided separately for the Antelope Valley
and the Coachella-San Jacinto Planning Area in Appendices I-A
and I-B, respectively. In addition, the District is assisting
MDAQMD in developing meteorological episodes needed by MDAQMD
to perform the attainment demonstration for the Barstow area of
the Mojave Desert. The future air quality projections are presented
in Appendix V-A.
<P>
Areas upwind of the South Coast Air Basin (primarily Ventura County,
but also including Santa Barbara County and the outer continental
shelf) will need to reduce emissions to allow those areas to come
into compliance with all air quality standards. If the South Coast
Air Basin is to comply, sources in these upwind areas will need
to reduce emissions further (i.e., reduce emissions beyond what
may be required to achieve the standards in these areas).
<H3>Assembly Bill 1054 </H3>

<P>
In 1992, state law [Health and Safety Code 39616(c), H&amp;SC
39616(d)(2), and H&amp;SC 40440.1] was enacted which sets forth
specific requirements directed toward the development of market-based
programs. The draft AQMP contains three key control measures that
propose to establish markets to expand existing market programs.
<P>
Market-based programs must be found by the state to meet the following
conditions:
<P>
(1) The program will result in an equivalent or greater reduction
in emissions at equivalent or less cost compared with current
command and control regulations and future air quality measures
that would otherwise have been adopted as part of the district's
plan for attainment.
<P>
(2) The program will provide a level of enforcement and monitoring
to ensure compliance with emission reduction requirements, comparable
with command and control air quality measures that would otherwise
have been adopted by the district for inclusion in the district's
plan for attainment.
<P>
(3) The program will establish a baseline methodology that provides
appropriate credit so that stationary sources of air pollution
which have been modified prior to implementation of the program
to reduce stationary source emissions are treated equitably.
<P>
(4) The program will not result in a greater loss of jobs or more
significant shifts from higher to lower skilled jobs, on an overall
districtwide basis, than that which would exist under command
and control air quality measures that would otherwise have been
adopted as part of the district's plan for attainment. A finding
of compliance with this requirement may be made in the same manner
as the analyses made by the district to meet the requirements
of Section 40728.5.
<P>
(5) The program will not in any manner delay, postpone, or otherwise
hinder district compliance with Chapter 10 (commencing with Section
40910) of Part 3 of the Health and Safety Code.
<P>
(6) The program will not result in disproportionate impacts, measured
on an aggregate basis, on those stationary sources included in
the program compared to other permitted stationary sources in
the district's attainment plan.
<P>
Additionally, state law requires market based programs to achieve
emission reductions across a spectrum of sources by allowing for
trading of emissions trading units for quantifiable reductions
in emissions from a significant number of different sources, including
mobile, area, and stationary. The program may be, but is not required
to be, initiated with only a limited number of sources, but, as
soon as practical after adoption of the initial program, the district
shall amend the program to allow the trading of reductions among
the sources initially included in the program and mobile, area,
and other stationary sources.

In this chapter, 1993 air quality in the South Coast Air Basin
(Basin) is compared to federal and state ambient air quality standards.
Information on the margin by which and the frequency with which
standards are exceeded is given for each pollutant and each area
of the Basin. Trends in Basin air quality through 1993 are discussed.
<P>
Nationwide air quality data for 1992, the most recent full year
for which U.S. air quality data are available, have also been
examined. Comparisons of 1992 air quality in other parts of the
U.S. and California to 1992 air quality in the Basin are presented.
<H2><A NAME="ambient">AMBIENT AIR QUALITY STANDARDS </A></H2>

<P>
Both California and the federal government have set air quality
standards for ozone, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur
dioxide, PM10, and lead (Table 2-1). California standards are
more stringent than the federal standards, and in the case of
PM10 and sulfur dioxide, far more stringent. California has also
set standards for sulfate, visibility, hydrogen sulfide, and vinyl
chloride.
<P>
Comparing 1992 air quality nationally, the federal standards were
exceeded more frequently in the Basin than in any other area of
the United States. Most federal standard exceedances in the Basin
are caused by ozone. The Basin's most affected monitoring location
(Glendora) exceeded the federal ozone standard on 118 days in
1992, compared to nine days of exceedances at the next highest
area outside California (Houston, Texas).
<P>
Despite the severity of the Basin's present air pollution problem,
it represents a substantial improvement over historical air quality.
The number of federal standard exceedances decreased by 47 percent
between 1976 and 1993, from 279 days to 147 days.
<H2><A NAME="comparison">COMPARISON TO OTHER U.S. AREAS </A></H2>

<P>
Southern California has the lowest summertime mean maximum mixing
height (a measure of how effectively air pollutants will be dispersed
vertically) in the United States. The area also has abundant sunshine
which can drive photochemical reactions that produce air pollutants
such as ozone. Of the ten largest urban areas in the United States,
the South Coast Air Basin has the lowest average wind speed. The
combination of poor atmospheric ventilation and emissions from
the second largest urban area in the U.S. give the South Coast
Air Basin the worst air pollution problem in the nation.
<P>
Figure 2-1-A shows maximum pollutant concentrations in 1992, the
most recent full year for which nationwide data are available,
for the South Coast Air Basin and for five of the largest U.S.
metropolitan areas outside of California. The South Coast Air
Basin recorded higher concentrations of ozone, carbon monoxide,
nitrogen dioxide, and PM10 than any other major urban area.

<P>
Sulfur dioxide concentrations, however, were higher in some of
the major urban areas in the eastern U.S. where high-sulfur fuels
such as coal are employed.
<P>
Figure 2-1-B compares the 1992 maximum pollutant concentrations
in the South Coast Air Basin to concentrations in metropolitan
areas elsewhere in California. Unlike the Basin, the San Diego,
Oxnard-Ventura and Sacramento metropolitan areas exceeded only
the federal ozone standard, and by a much smaller margin than
in the Basin. San Francisco did not exceed any of the air quality
standards. Maximum concentrations in Southern California's San
Diego and Oxnard-Ventura metropolitan areas frequently reflect
transport from the neighboring Los Angeles metropolitan area.
<P>
Maximum pollutant concentrations are not always recorded in the
largest urban areas, but depend as well on the nature of local
emissions sources and weather. The Houston area, which like Southern
California is an area of abundant sunshine which promotes photochemical
reactions, recorded higher ozone concentrations than much more
populous New York and Chicago. Table 2-2 shows 1992 maximum pollutant
concentrations and exceedances of standards for all U.S. locations.
<P>
The Basin's Glendora station in eastern Los Angeles County recorded
the highest ozone concentration (0.30 ppm) and the greatest number
of exceedances of the federal ozone standard (118 days) in the
nation. This was more than twice the number of exceedances at
the next highest California location (57 days at Hesperia), and
more than ten times the number of exceedances at the next highest
location outside California (nine days at Houston, Texas).
<P>
The Basin's Lynwood station in central Los Angeles County recorded
the highest concentration (18.8 ppm) of carbon monoxide and the
greatest number of exceedances (31 days) of the federal carbon
monoxide standard. The number of exceedances at Lynwood was more
than four times the number at the next highest location outside
the Basin (seven days recorded at Denver, Colorado).
<P>
Basin locations recorded the highest annual average PM10 concentration
(78.9 &#181;g/m<FONT SIZE=2>3</FONT> recorded at Ontario) and
the highest annual average nitrogen dioxide concentration (0.0507
ppm at Pomona) in the United States. The highest concentrations
of sulfur dioxide and lead were recorded in other areas of the
U.S.
<P>
Although the Basin's air quality is the worst in the nation, it
represents a significant improvement over historical air quality
in the area. In 1976, one or more of the federal standards were
exceeded at Basin locations on 279 days. In 1993, the federal
standards were exceeded on 147 days, a decrease of 47 percent.

Trends in the percent of days exceeding each of the federal standards
over the nineteen year period from 1975 to 1993 are shown in Figure
2-2. Between 1975-1977 and 1991-1993 federal standard exceedances
decreased by 32 percent for ozone, and 76 percent for carbon monoxide.
State standard exceedances decreased by 94 percent for nitrogen
dioxide. Sampling for PM10 was initiated in late 1984, and between
1985-1986 and 1991-1993 exceedances of the federal PM10 standard
decreased 44 percent. Between 1975-77 and 1991-93, exceedances
of the lead standard were eliminated at regular monitoring sites,
although a single violation of the state standard occurred at
a special monitoring site in the immediate vicinity of a stationary
source in 1993. The federal sulfur dioxide standard was met throughout
the period.<BR>

(S) Standard, 1975-1993</CENTER>
<P>
Ozone, the pollutant which exceeds the federal standard level
most frequently, has been monitored continuously at a few Basin
locations since the late 1950s. Azusa, in the most affected area
of the Basin, recorded 221 days exceeding the federal standard
in 1960, 190 days in 1970, 129 days in 1980 and 79 days in 1993.
Hourly ozone concentrations approaching 0.70 ppm were reported
in the early 1950s, and Stage III Episodes (ozone exceeding 0.50
ppm) were relatively frequent events in the 1960s. During the
period 1986-1993, the highest hourly concentration recorded in
the Basin was 0.35 ppm. Despite a population increase of 84 percent
between 1960 and 1990, and associated increases in industrial
activity and vehicle miles traveled, pollutant concentrations
have been significantly reduced. Nonetheless, in 1993 measured
concentrations of some pollutants were still well above standards
set to protect public health.
<H2><A NAME="current">CURRENT AIR QUALITY </A></H2>

<P>
The 1993 annual maximum pollutant concentrations are shown in
Figure 2-3 as a percent of the state and federal standards. Figure
2-4 shows the percent of days, months, or quarters in 1993 in
which each pollutant exceeded the standards at the most affected
locations. Of the federal standards which were exceeded in 1993,
the ozone standard was exceeded most frequently, followed by carbon
monoxide, and PM10. Ozone levels also exceeded the federal standard
by the widest margin, with a maximum concentration that was 215
percent of the standard, followed by carbon monoxide (154 percent)
and PM10 (145 percent of the annual standard).

Appendix II-A contains a detailed analysis of current air quality
and statistics for all monitoring locations for the years 1990-1993.
Appendix II-B contains detailed information on air quality trends
over the years 1976-1993. The following section discusses which
areas in the Basin exceeded state and federal standards in 1993.

<P>
<B>Significant progress has been made in reducing ozone concentrations
over the past decade in the Basin and the Southeast Desert Air
Basin (SEDAB). However, the Basin still exceeds the federal ozone
standard far more frequently than any other area of the United
States.</B>
<P>
In 1993, the South Coast Air Quality Management District (District)
monitored ozone at 35 sites. The federal standard was exceeded
at all but one location (Lynwood). The state standard was exceeded
at all locations. The Stage I Episode level (1-hour average ozone
equal to or greater than 0.20 ppm) was exceeded at 13 locations.
<P>
Figure 2-5 shows that, during 1993, the federal ozone standard
was exceeded least frequently in the coastal area and most frequently
in the inland valley area of the Basin, which extends from the
eastern San Fernando Valley through the San Gabriel Valley into
the Riverside-San Bernardino area and the adjacent mountains.
The number of exceedances decreased further inland, in the desert
areas.<BR>

(0.28 ppm) were recorded at Glendora. No Stage II Episodes (1-hour
average 0.35 ppm or greater) have occurred since 1988.
<H2>Carbon Monoxide </H2>

<P>
<B>The number of days exceeding the carbon monoxide standards
decreased substantially between the mid-70s and the mid-80s, increased
in the late 80s, then decreased again in the 1990s. In 1992, Los
Angeles county recorded more exceedances of the federal carbon
monoxide standard than any other area of the United States.</B>
<P>
In 1993, exceedances of the federal standard were limited to coastal/central
Los Angeles county (Figure 2-6). Carbon monoxide was monitored
at 24 locations in 1993. The federal and state 8-hour carbon monoxide
standards were exceeded at two locations. Lynwood reported the
greatest number of exceedances of both federal and state standards
(22 and 29 days, respectively). The highest 8-hour average concentration
(14.6 ppm at Lynwood) was one and a half times the federal standard.

<H2>Nitrogen Dioxide </H2>

<P>
<B>Concentrations of nitrogen dioxide decreased over the period
1976-1993. By 1991, exceedances of the federal standard were limited
to one location in Los Angeles county, the only county in the
United States that still did not meet the federal nitrogen dioxide
standard. For the first time in 1992, and again in 1993, no Basin
location exceeded the federal standard. However, the state standard
continued to be exceeded.</B>
<P>
Figure 2-7 shows the number of days on which the state nitrogen
dioxide standard was exceeded in 1993. Exceedances were limited
to central Los Angeles county. In 1993, nitrogen dioxide was monitored
at 25 locations. Of these, only one location exceeded the state
standard, on one day.
<P>
The 1993 maximum annual average concentration (0.0499 ppm at Pomona)
was 93 percent of the federal standard. The 1993 maximum 1-hour
average concentration (0.26 ppm at Pico Rivera) barely exceeded
the state standard.
<P>
The Basin was the only area in the entire United States which
exceeded the federal standard in 1991. In 1992, the highest annual
average concentration (0.0507 ppm) in the nation was recorded
at Pomona but it was below the federal standard.<BR>

<H2>PM10 </H2>

<P>
<B>In 1993, the federal PM10 standards were exceeded in many areas.
The more stringent state PM10 standards were exceeded in most
areas, frequently by a wide margin. </B>
<P>
Figure 2-8 shows the 1993 annual average (arithmetic mean) PM10
concentrations in different areas in the Basin. Concentrations
averaged lowest near the coast and highest in the inland valleys.
<P>
In 1993, PM10 was monitored at 21 sites. The federal annual standard
(annual arithmetic mean PM10 greater than 50 micrograms per cubic
meter) was exceeded at six locations and the federal 24-hour standard
(24-hour average greater than 150 micrograms per cubic meter)
was exceeded at two locations. The state annual standard (annual
geometric mean PM10 greater than 30 micrograms per cubic meter)
was exceeded at 15 locations. The state 24-hour standard (24-hour
average PM10 greater than 50 micrograms per cubic meter) was exceeded
at all locations.
<P>
Rubidoux, in the Riverside county portion of the Basin, reported
the highest annual average PM10 concentration (72.4 &#181;g/m<FONT SIZE=2>3</FONT>)
in 1993. The highest 24-hour average PM10 (231 &#181;g/m<FONT SIZE=2>3</FONT>)
was also recorded at Rubidoux.<BR>

<H2>Sulfur Dioxide </H2>

<P>
<B>Though sulfur dioxide concentrations have been reduced to levels
well below state and federal standards, further reductions in
emissions of sulfur oxides are needed to attain compliance with
standards for other pollutants (sulfate and PM10).</B>
<P>
Sulfur dioxide concentrations did not exceed federal or state
standards in 1993. The highest 24-hour average concentration (0.014
ppm recorded at Hawthorne and Long Beach) was 10 percent of the
federal standard. The maximum 1-hour average concentration (0.07
ppm at Hawthorne) was 27 percent of the state standard. The last
exceedance of the state standard (the only violation since 1984)
occurred in 1990 and was caused by an equipment breakdown at a
local refinery.
<H2>Sulfates </H2>

<P>
<B>In 1993, no Basin locations exceeded the state sulfate standard.
Sulfate concentrations have been reduced by the increasingly stringent
controls placed on stationary source emissions of sulfur dioxide
and by limits on the sulfur content of fuels.</B>
<P>
In 1993, the maximum 24-hour average sulfate concentration (20.5
&#181;g/m<FONT SIZE=2>3</FONT> at Hawthorne) was 82 percent of
the state standard.
<H2>Lead </H2>

<P>
<B>Lead concentrations once exceeded the state and federal standards
by a wide margin, but have not exceeded state or federal standards
at any regular monitoring station since 1982. However, special
monitoring sites immediately downwind of sources showed very localized
violations of the state standard in 1993.</B>
<P>
The 1993 maximum quarterly average lead concentration at any regular
monitoring station (0.11 &#181;g/m<FONT SIZE=2>3</FONT>) was recorded
at Pico Rivera and was less than a tenth of the federal standard.
Pico Rivera also recorded the highest monthly average lead concentration
(0.15 &#181;g/m<FONT SIZE=2>3</FONT>), which was one-tenth of
the state standard.
<P>
Higher concentrations were recorded at special monitoring sites
immediately downwind of sources. The maximum quarterly average
concentration (1.38 &#181;g/m<FONT SIZE=2>3</FONT>) was 91 percent
of the federal standard, and the maximum monthly average (1.83
&#181;g/m<FONT SIZE=2>3</FONT>) was 122 percent of the state standard.
District Rule 1420 was adopted to address such exceedances.
<H2>Visibility </H2>

<P>
The effect of air pollution on visibility is not limited to simply
reducing the distance a person can see, but also includes negative
aesthetic impacts on the color, form, and contrast of the scene
being viewed. In 1993, the state visibility standard was violated
by a significant margin.
<P>
Visibility data were obtained for two locations in 1993, both
of which violated the standard. The standard was violated most
frequently at San Bernardino (53 percent of days with relative
humidity less than 70 percent).
<H2>Summary </H2>

<P>
Though pollutant concentrations in the Basin have been reduced
significantly over the past decade, some standards are still exceeded
frequently and by a wide margin.
<P>
A detailed summary of the 1993 maximum concentrations and the
frequencies of exceedances for each of the monitoring stations
in the Basin and SEDAB is presented in Table 2-3.

<H2><A NAME="intro">INTRODUCTION</A> </H2>

<P>
Solving the air quality problem in Southern California represents
a considerable challenge. The solutions lie in implementing technological
and innovative changes that provide for achieving clean air goals
while maintaining a healthy economy. This 1994 Air Quality Management
Plan (AQMP) is designed to meet this challenge. This Plan demonstrates
attainment of federal and state ambient air quality standards
while defining policies that seek to minimize the impact on the
local economy. This is not easily achieved given the constraints
to meeting air quality standards such as population growth and
local meteorological conditions.
<P>
The AQMP proposes policies and measures to achieve federal and
state standards for healthful air quality in the South Coast Air
Basin and those portions of the Southeast Desert Air Basin that
are under the South Coast Air Quality Management District's (District)
jurisdiction (namely, Antelope Valley and Coachella Valley). This
revision to the Plan also addresses several state and federal
planning requirements and incorporates many new programs and process
developments implemented since the 1991 AQMP. It still calls for
the implementation of all feasible control measures and the advancement
and use of technologies for which breakthroughs are on the horizon.
<P>
The District has made considerable progress since the adoption
of the 1991 AQMP. Key accomplishments include the New Directions
campaign, the RECLAIM program for oxides of nitrogen and oxides
of sulfur, the Small Business Assistance program, and the Economic
Development and Business Retention efforts. The District's New
Directions campaign, which included permit streamlining, source
education, and compliance assistance programs, was created in
order to make the clean air effort less burdensome and more efficient.
The adoption of the oxides of nitrogen and oxides of sulfur RECLAIM
program in October 1993 represents a significant milestone for
the District after more than three years of rule development.
RECLAIM calls for declining mass emission limits on the total
emissions from all sources within a facility, allowing the facility
operation a choice of methods to reduce emissions, rather than
the traditional &quot;command and control&quot; approach. The
District's Small Business Assistance (SBA) Office was established
to help owners/operators of small businesses comply with air quality
rules and regulations. It offers assistance in a variety of forms,
from assisting with permit applications to loans for control equipment.
The Economic Development and Business Retention office performs
two vital functions in the District: to facilitate the commercialization
of new low-emitting technologies and, to create jobs and help
retain existing businesses through introduction of and conversion
to more efficient and less-polluting technologies. 
<H2><A NAME="whatnew">WHAT IS NEW IN THIS PLAN REVISION? </A>
</H2>

<P>
Each revision of the AQMP represents a snapshot in time, based
on best available information. The 1994 AQMP generally follows
the structure of the last Plan (1991) but like all new editions
includes many enhancements. Key new elements are: 
<P>
Use of the most current air quality information (1993);
<P>
Improved emissions inventories;
<P>
Revised overall control strategy with greater emphasis on alternative
approaches;
<P>
Updated and refined control measures carried over from the 1991
AQMP as well as new control measures;
<P>
Additional market-incentive control measures to give sources the
ability to meet their air quality objectives with greater flexibility
and lower cost;
<P>
Enhanced photochemical modeling;
<P>
Separate analysis for those portions of the Southeast Desert Air
Basin (SEDAB) within the District's jurisdiction;
<P>
Amendments to the federal Reactive Organic Compound (ROC) Rate-of-Progress
Plan and the Federal Attainment Plans for nitrogen dioxide and
carbon monoxide; and
<P>
The federal post-1996 Rate-of-Progress demonstration, Best Available
Control Measure (BACM) PM10 Plan, and ozone attainment demonstration.

<H2><A NAME="howplanprep">HOW WAS THIS PLAN REVISION PREPARED</A>?
</H2>

<P>
This AQMP Revision was developed based on input and participation
of numerous individuals and groups since the adoption of the 1991
AQMP. The District and the Southern California Association of
Governments (SCAG) sponsored several task forces, working groups,
and public workshops that have resulted in recommendations relative
to technologies for mobile and stationary sources as well as implementation
approaches. Additionally, task forces examined and proposed transportation
control measures and how they should be implemented. EPA's recently
released Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) also provides a source
of control measures, particularly for off-road sources. Finally,
this Plan reflects much of what has been learned through the development
of the District RECLAIM, Small Business Assistance, Technology
Advancement, and Economic Development and Business Retention programs.
In addition, public comments received during the public consultation
meetings held in October 1993, February 1994, and March 1994 are
incorporated into the control strategy development. Figure ES
- 1 illustrates the input provided for the Plan.
<P>
The Draft AQMP was released in April 1994. Twenty-five separate
workshops, several public hearings and numerous technical meetings
with affected and interested parties were held throughout the
Basin to review the draft Plan and to receive comments and further
input. These comments have been carefully evaluated and amendments
were made to the Plan to address issues raised.

<H2><A NAME="improv">IS AIR QUALITY IMPROVING</A>? </H2>

<P>
Yes. There has been a significant improvement in air quality in
the South Coast Air Basin over previous years' air pollution levels.
Between 1976 and 1993, the number of days the federal standard
was exceeded decreased by 47 percent. The calendar year 1993,
for example, represents one of the cleanest years on record for
the Basin. The federal standards were exceeded at one or more
locations in the Basin on 147 days, however, which is more frequently
than any other area of the nation. Figure ES-2 shows the 1993
air quality in the South Coast Air Basin as a percentage of the
air quality standard.
<P>
Of the federal and state standards which were exceeded in 1993,
the ozone standard was exceeded most frequently, followed by carbon
monoxide, and PM10. The state nitrogen dioxide standard was only
exceeded once in 1993, and the federal standard was not exceeded
on any occasion. Sulfur dioxide, sulfate and lead concentrations
were below both the state and federal standards.

<CENTER>1993 Air Quality in the South Coast Air Basin</CENTER>
<P>
Despite its improved air quality over the past years, the South
Coast Air Basin has the worst ozone air quality in the nation
and is the only area designated as &quot;extreme&quot; nonattainment
for ozone. The Basin is the only area in nonattainment of the
federal nitrogen dioxide air quality standard. In 1992, the Basin
recorded the greatest number of exceedances of the federal carbon
monoxide standard in the nation. PM10 levels are also very high
compared to most other areas. 
<H2><A NAME="fedstatreq">WHAT ARE THE APPLICABLE KEY FEDERAL AND
STATE REQUIREMENTS THAT THIS PLAN REVISION ADDRESSES</A>? </H2>

<H3>Federal </H3>

<P>
In November 1990, Congress enacted a series of amendments to the
Clean Air Act intended to intensify air pollution control efforts
across the nation. One of the primary goals of the 1990 amendments
to the Clean Air Act (CAA) was an overhaul of the planning provisions
for those areas not currently meeting National Ambient Air Quality
Standards (NAAQS). The CAA identifies specific emission reduction
goals, requires both a demonstration of reasonable further progress
and attainment, and incorporates more stringent sanctions for
failure to attain or to meet interim milestones. 
<P>
In addition, the CAA requires the District to develop: a Federal
Attainment Plan for Ozone (Ozone Plan) as given in Section 182
(c)(2)(A); a post-1996 Rate-of-Progress Plan as required in Section
182(c)(2)(B); Ozone Attainment Demonstrations for the Los Angeles
county portion of the SEDAB (Antelope Valley) and the Riverside
Nonattainment area of the SEDAB (Coachella - San Jacinto Planning
Area); and a PM10 State Implementation Plan (SIP) which incorporates
best available control measures (BACM) for fugitive sources (referred
to as the PM10 BACM SIP), as required by Section 189(b)(1)(B).

<H3>State </H3>

<P>
The California Clean Air Act (CCAA) was signed into law on September
30, 1988. Through its many requirements, the CCAA serves as the
centerpiece of the Basin's attainment planning efforts since it
is generally more stringent than the 1990 federal Clean Air Act
Amendments.
<P>
Key CCAA requirements that the District must address in the 1994
AQMP are to: apply Best Available Retrofit Control Technology;
reduce nonattainment pollutants and their precursors at a rate
of five percent per year, or, if this cannot be done, include
all feasible measures and an expeditious implementation schedule;
achieve an average vehicle ridership during peak commute hours
of 1.5 persons per vehicle by 1999; ensure no net increase in
mobile source emissions after 1997; reduce population exposure
to severe nonattainment pollutants (i.e., ozone, carbon monoxide,
and nitrogen dioxide for the Basin) according to a prescribed
schedule; and, rank control measures by cost-effectiveness and
implementation priority. Additionally, state law requires market-based
programs proposed as part of the AQMP to meet specific design
requirements. Finally, state law requires the plan to provide
for attainment of the federal and state ambient air quality standards
(Health &amp; Safety Code Section 40462). 
<H2><A NAME="emissioninv">HOW HAS THE EMISSIONS INVENTORY CHANGED?
</A></H2>

<P>
For this Plan revision, a 1990 emissions inventory is relied upon
to establish baseline and future year projections. The inventories
were developed according to procedures stemming from the Federal
Clean Air Act. To meet state law requirements, an updated 1987
emissions inventory is also provided. 
<P>
The 1990 emissions inventory represents the most comprehensive
emissions inventory ever established for the South Coast Air Basin.
Stationary sources were audited relative to their 1990 emissions.
Mobile sources are estimated with the latest approved emissions
factors supplied by the California Air Resources Board (ARB).

<P>
Using the 1990 emissions inventory, future emission forecasts
are also developed. These forecasts reflect demographic and economic
growth forecasts by SCAG. The California Energy Commission (CEC)
energy forecasts incorporating efficiency standards are also used
to refine emission projections. In addition, emission reductions
resulting from ARB and District regulations adopted by December
31, 1993 are included in the forecasts.
<P>
It is important to note that recent studies indicate that on-road
mobile emissions are underestimated. In spite of the underestimation,
mobile source control strategies have been effective in reducing
a significant amount of emissions as evident in the carbon monoxide
air quality measurements. Recognizing the need to better quantify
mobile source emissions, the ARB embarked on a series of long-term
research programs. Some of the early results indicate that current
mobile source emission estimates may be as much as 60 percent
higher in hydrocarbon or volatile organic compounds (VOC) and
twice as high in carbon monoxide emissions.
<P>
Although these numbers are preliminary and are subject to change
as the results are reviewed, this Plan analyzes the potential
impacts of higher mobile source emissions on present and future
ozone air quality. This analysis provides guidance on the efficacy
of the proposed control strategy and lays the foundation to address
future mobile source emission increases. 
<H2><A NAME="controlstrategy">HAS THE OVERALL CONTROL STRATEGY
CHANGED</A>? </H2>

<P>
The basic control strategy remains the same in many respects.
However, there are some refinements proposed with this revision.
For example, what were called Tier I measures in the 1991 AQMP
are now referred to as short- and intermediate-term measures in
the 1994 AQMP. Additionally, what were called Tier II and Tier
III measures in the 1991 AQMP have been consolidated, and are
now referred to as long-term measures.
<P>
Short- and intermediate-term emission reduction measures are those
that can be adopted using currently available technological applications,
statutory authority, and management practices. Such measures have
been defined for stationary, mobile and area source categories.
<P>
Long-term emission reduction measures include already-demonstrated
but commercially unavailable control technologies and &quot;on-the-horizon&quot;
technologies requiring advancements that can reasonably be expected
to occur in the near future. This category also includes measures
that require commitments for research, development, and widespread
commercial application of technologies that may not exist yet,
but may be reasonably expected given the rapid technological advances
gained over the past 20 years. The federal Clean Air Act recognized
the need to develop new technology control measures and specifically
provided &quot;extreme&quot; ozone nonattainment areas the necessary
time to develop these control measures [Section 182(e)(5)]. Many
of the long-term emission reduction measures which rely on technologies
that are not currently developed are considered as meeting Section
182(e)(5) requirements. 
<H3>Short-Term Measures </H3>

<P>
The 1994 AQMP continues its &quot;fuel neutral&quot; strategy
to reduce vehicle emissions through the establishment of more
stringent emission and fuel quality standards. The on-road motor
vehicle control strategy embodied in this Plan revision is principally
based on the September 1990 ARB Low Emission Vehicle (LEV) and
Clean Fuels regulations. The Plan extrapolates the ARB requirements
to 2010 and proposes some additional measures.
<P>
The 1994 AQMP also proposes to reduce on-road mobile emissions
through the implementation of transportation control measures
(TCMs), aimed at reducing emissions by reducing vehicle miles
traveled (VMT). A TCM Policy Committee and Technical Advisory
Group were chartered by the District Governing Board and SCAG
Regional Council to develop recommendations relative to which
TCMs would be proposed in the 1994 Plan Revision. Also, SCAG established
Advanced Transportation Technology and Market Incentives Task
Forces, and a Regional Railroad Air Quality Emission Reduction
Board that developed recommendations for the Plan. The strategies
in this Plan reflect many of the recommendations from these groups.
<P>
For stationary sources, the 1994 AQMP proposes process changes
and applications of control equipment that are technologically
feasible, similar to that proposed in the 1991 AQMP. To ultimately
achieve clean air standards, the Plan will also rely on the advancement
of technology that may be reasonably expected to be utilized by
the year 2010.
<P>
Off-road sources such as ships, locomotives, aircraft, farming
and construction equipment, and non-road engines are regulated
primarily by the EPA and ARB. The Plan contains several measures
directed at these sources which are based in part or largely on
proposals contained in EPA's recently released Federal Implementation
Plan (FIP). To the extent necessary to attain air quality standards,
the 1994 AQMP proposes additional measures going beyond that proposed
in the FIP to include other controls that can reasonably be expected
for off-road sources. 
<H3>Long-Term Measures </H3>

<P>
To ultimately achieve ambient air quality standards, additional
emission reductions will be necessary beyond the implementation
of short- and intermediate-term measures. To develop the overall
long-term strategy for the Plan, an iterative process of ambient
air quality modeling and technology assessment was utilized.
<P>
Both the 1989 and 1991 AQMPs sought maximum VOC emission reductions
by relying heavily on technological breakthroughs for VOC control.
This Plan proposes to achieve the federal ozone and PM10 standards
through long-term measures that emphasize a greater reduction
of oxides of nitrogen emissions from on- and off-road sources
than the previous plans. This approach reflects recent and expected
technological breakthroughs relative to alternative fuels and
control technologies for these sources. 
<H2><A NAME="whatroleincentives">WHAT ROLE DO MARKET INCENTIVES
AND OTHER ALTERNATIVE IMPLEMENTATION APPROACHES HAVE IN THIS PLAN
REVISION</A>? </H2>

<P>
Alternative implementation approaches represent one of the most
important elements of this Plan revision as compared to the 1991
AQMP. New approaches proposed in this Plan are described below,
and include: expanding the use of market incentives; incorporating
new education programs and manufacturer certification processes;
and more fully utilizing the SIP fix process. 
<H3>Market Incentives </H3>

<P>
In addition to the traditional &quot;command and control&quot;
regulations, the 1994 Plan will seek to expand the District's
market-incentive initiatives. Examples include: a proposed RECLAIM
program for volatile organic compounds; expanding the existing
RECLAIM program to include more facilities; and creating area
source credits for commercial and residential low-emissions equipment
and energy conservation. Additional &quot;financial&quot; measures
under consideration include incentives such as: tax credits for
companies that develop and implement new technology to reduce
vehicular emissions; emission-based vehicle registration; and
rebates, tax credits or emission-based vehicle sales taxes to
encourage the manufacture and purchase of lower-polluting vehicles.
Some of these measures require legislative action for implementation.
All of these potential control measures work towards the District's
goal of achieving emission reductions with the greatest amount
of flexibility to the regulated community. 
<H3>Educational/Public Outreach </H3>

<P>
As the District progresses towards achieving clean air, additional
small source categories are asked to do their fair share. The
trend in both the 1989 and 1991 AQMPs was the identification of
these smaller source categories that historically have not been
regulated by air quality regulations. Similar to this, the 1994
AQMP will also be addressing some smaller, more diverse sources.
<P>
Rule development for these smaller and more diverse sources presents
challenges for both the District and the affected businesses.
Developing and implementing pragmatic rules for small source categories
can be as much or more laborious than for larger sources. In addition,
it can be more difficult for smaller sources to participate in
the rule development process in some instances.
<P>
To address these issues, the District will be proposing a series
of public awareness and education programs for small sources in
the 1994 AQMP. The intent of these programs is to develop a partnership
between the District and the business community and to educate
sources regarding alternative products, techniques, processes,
and equipment modifications that can be used at their facility
to reduce pollution. These programs are an appropriate approach
for encouraging small businesses to implement cleaner operations.
The majority of control methods presented in these public awareness
measures are designed to be simple and relatively inexpensive
to implement. 
<H3>Manufacturer Certification </H3>

<P>
For some smaller sources, the Plan also proposes to rely on emissions
standards established on the manufacturers of products used by
these sources. The program would principally be directed at the
sale of equipment in the Basin. This approach is currently in
use for home water heaters in Rule 1121 and the Plan proposes
to expand this approach for other smaller combustion sources such
as small boilers, process heaters and internal combustion engines.
Manufacturers of this equipment would meet a specified emission
standard for their engine/equipment to be sold in the Basin.
<P>
Additionally, the Plan proposes an enhanced in-use compliance
program for such sources. The proposed measure would require manufacturers
to test a sample of such equipment after a specified period of
time while in use and recall/tune units as needed to meet in-use
emission standards. 
<H3>SIP Corrections </H3>

<P>
When a rule is adopted or amended by the District's Governing
Board, it is submitted to the ARB for a &quot;completeness&quot;
check. If approved, the rule is then forwarded to EPA for final
review and inclusion into the State Implementation Plan. If either
agency finds an administrative provision deficiency in a rule
(i.e., language, test methods, etc.), the rule is returned to
the District for a &quot;SIP fix.&quot; One strategy proposed
for inclusion in the 1994 AQMP is to piggyback the adoption of
new control measures which have limited air quality benefits with
rule amendments for SIP correction purposes. This will provide
for more efficient utilization of District and affected-party
resources. 
<H2><A NAME="whatroletcms">WHAT IS THE ROLE OF TCMS IN THIS PLAN?
</A></H2>

<P>
The 1990 Federal Clean Air Act Amendments require the development
of near-term and long-term transportation control measures (TCMs)
as well as contingency measures. The California Clean Air Act
also requires the establishment of an indirect source requirement
to reduce vehicle miles traveled and to increase average vehicle
ridership. An indirect source is defined as any facility, building,
structure or installation or combination thereof, which generates
or attracts mobile source activity that results in emissions of
any pollutant for which there is a state ambient air quality standard.
The federal Clean Air Act requires that both &quot;near-term&quot;
and &quot;long-term&quot; TCMs be developed for the Basin. Near-term
measures must be implemented before the year 2000, while long-term
measures are to be implemented post 2000. However, some of the
measures categorized as long-term in the 1994 Plan may begin initial
implementation steps prior to the year 2000.
<P>
A Technical Advisory Group (TAG) was established by the District's
Governing Board and SCAG's Regional Council to tackle the issue
of TCMs and indirect sources. The TAG reports to the TCM Policy
Committee, which provides recommendations for the 1994 AQMP. TAG
members were primarily technical staff, while the TCM Policy Committee
consisted primarily of elected officials. The &quot;mission&quot;
of both groups was twofold: 1) to develop TCMs for the 1994 AQMP
and to build consensus throughout the region on which TCMs should
be included in the 1994 AQMP; and 2) to define the implementation
approach of these measures. 
<H2><A NAME="whatrolefedplan">WHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE RECENTLY
PROPOSED FEDERAL IMPLEMENTATION PLAN? </A></H2>

<P>
On February 14, 1994, the EPA Administrator signed the draft Federal
Implementation Plan (FIP) for the South Coast, Ventura, and Sacramento
regions. The FIP was prepared by EPA under court order. The court
required EPA to promulgate a plan to demonstrate compliance with
the Clean Air Act's ozone and carbon monoxide standards. 
<P>
EPA will be relying on the 1994 Air Quality Management Plan to
replace, in part or in whole, many of the proposed measures set
forth in the FIP. If EPA determines that the 1994 AQMP meets the
attainment goals and requirements for control measures, the AQMP
could be substituted for the FIP. 
<P>
In that case, the 1994 AQMP would be the air quality plan enforced
in the Basin. If EPA determines, however, that the AQMP is deficient
in whole or in part, it could incorporate any approved AQMP measures
into the FIP. The FIP would then serve as the Plan for the Basin
until the AQMP deficiencies are corrected.
<P>
The attainment strategy in the FIP was developed based on the
1987 baseline emissions inventory utilized for the 1991 AQMP.
As part of the development process, EPA will update the FIP attainment
strategy based on the 1990 baseline emissions inventory utilized
in the 1994 AQMP.
<P>
The 1994 AQMP incorporates the emission reductions and implementation
approaches from several measures proposed in the FIP. In particular,
the control measures for federally regulated sources are proposed
as part of the overall control strategy in the Basin. These FIP
measures include on-road and off-road mobile source control strategies,
and statewide area source control strategies. In some cases, the
AQMP modifies proposed FIP measures. The FIP measures incorporated
into the 1994 AQMP provide needed emissions reductions to achieve
the federal ozone air quality standard. The draft FIP will be
finalized in February 1995. Once EPA finalizes the FIP, the District
will evaluate whether the Plan should be amended. If the emission
reductions associated with the proposed measures are not realized,
the 1994 AQMP must seek equivalent emission reductions from other
emission sources. 
<H2><A NAME="hasattainment">HAS THE ATTAINMENT PROJECTION CHANGED
FOR FEDERAL OR STATE STANDARDS? </A></H2>

<P>
No. The 1994 AQMP proposes to attain the state and federal standards
in the same time frame as proposed in the 1991 AQMP and 1992 federal
attainment plans for nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide. (See
Figure ES-3.)<BR>

<blockquote><P>Understanding air pollution requirements can be challenging.  Our trained staff can answer questions by telephone or meet with you in person at your facility to discuss your particular operation.</P>
<P>We offer on-site Technical Consultation Service which consists of a no-fault inspection of your facility.  During the inspection you will be advised on what equipment requires an AQMD permit or is exempt from permit requirements.  You will also be provided application forms, supplemental information, fee information and everything required to submit a complete application package.  </P>
<P>Finally, our staff will show you the most cost-effective means of complying with AQMD regulations.  There is no charge for this service, and  violations uncovered during this confidential consultation will not result in fines or penalties, provided they are corrected in a reasonable period of time.</P>

<P>The Air Quality Assistance Fund is available for small businesses in need of financing for the purchase and installation of air pollution controls, or for process changes to comply with air quality rules.  The AQAF will issue a guarantee of repayment to your lender if you are an eligible, credit-worthy small business.  </P>
<P>This program is designed to motivate lenders to offer financing terms usually available to only their most-preferred customers - lower interest rates, longer repayment schedules, and the lowest financing costs.  This will help you avoid using scarce working capital or credit lines when you need to invest in air pollution control equipment.</P>
<P>Loan guarantees, which can range between $25,000 to $250,000, can be issued for up to 90% of the loan amount and accrued interest.  The maximum term of repayment is seven years - this helps keep the monthly payment manageable.</P>
<P>The AQMD does not lend money.  Your lender must apply for a loan guarantee on your behalf.  If you need a lender we can help you find one and work with them to get the funding started.</P></blockquote>
<P><center><B>What if I need extra time to comply?</B></center>
<blockquote><P>There may be good reasons why you cannot immediately comply with air pollution control laws.  The only legal way you can continue to operate while working toward a solution is to get a variance from the Hearing Board.  A variance allows you to temporarily continue operating in violation of AQMD rules without being subject to penalties.  You may be eligible for the consent calendar which allows a variance to be granted without the business being present for the hearing.</P>
<P>The<a href = "http://www.aqmd.gov/hearbd/hearbd.html"><U> Hearing Board</U> </a> is a five-member independent panel that hears appeals from businesses and the public.  It can grant businesses temporary relief from AQMD rule requirements under certain circumstances.</P>

<FONT SIZE=4>SOUTH COAST AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT<BR>
</FONT></H5>
<H5>Dec. 13, 1996</H5>
<HR>


<P><B>AQMD ELIMINATES PERMIT REQUIREMENTS FOR 10,000 SOURCES</B>
<P> Eliminating 10,000 air pollution control permits and saving businesses some $1.5 million a year, the South Coast Air Quality Management District Governing Board today voted to exempt a variety of equipment from its permit requirements.
<P> The exemption helps implement one element of AQMD's 1996 Regulatory Reform Initiative, namely, to eliminate or streamline permits for small businesses.  That initiative outlined a number of steps to ease the regulatory burden on the region's businesses.
<P> &quot;We're achieving our air quality goals, but are also committed to minimizing paperwork and other requirements that don't really contribute to air pollution control,&quot; said Jon D. Mikels, AQMD chairman.
<P> &quot;We'll continue to move forward in a balanced manner toward both clean air and regulatory reform in the year ahead.&quot;
<P> The exemptions were made in amendments to AQMD's Rule 219, which lists equipment that does not require an air pollution control permit.
<P> Now exempt from permit requirements are freon recycling equipment, small portable internal combustion engines, small paint spray booths, fuel oil storage tanks, powder coating ovens and other equipment that produces minimal pollution or is regulated by another agency.
<P> The small portable engines exempted from AQMD requirements will be covered under a statewide registration program.  The federal EPA regulates freon recycling equipment.
<P> Future reforms will expand a registration process for small equipment.  The registration will provide simple guidelines to help ensure air pollution is minimized.
<P> Next, AQMD plans to expand the registration concept for individual pieces of equipment to cover small businesses as a whole, including all their equipment.  A simplified facility-based registration will be developed for several industries, including auto body shops and dry cleaners.
<P> The goal of both registration programs is to ease permitting and compliance requirements and reduce fees for businesses.

<P><A ID="I3" NAME="I3"></A><B>AQMD ADOPTS RULE TO CUT INDUSTRIAL CLEANING EMISSIONS</B></P>
<P><A ID="I4" NAME="I4"></A>Thousands of Southland businesses will slash the smog-forming ingredients in petroleum solvents -- and save money doing so -- thanks to a measure adopted today by the region's air quality agency.</P>
<P>The South Coast Air Quality Management District's Governing Board voted 7 to 1 to virtually eliminate petroleum solvent-based industrial cleaning products and replace them primarily with water-based cleaners by 1999.</P>
<P>&quot;This rule presents a true win-win opportunity, since it will help clean the air and save businesses money at the same time,&quot; said James M. Lents, AQMD executive officer.</P>
<P>&quot;That&#146;s because water-based cleaners are usually cheaper to buy and use than petroleum solvent-based products.&quot;</P>
<P>In other action on Friday, AQMD's board adopted a measure to reduce volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from industrial wastewater systems at oil refineries and other facilities.  The rule will cut VOCs by 3.0 tons per day by 2000.</P>
<P>Cleaning solvents are widely used by tens of thousands of Southland businesses, from automotive shops to printers, to clean up grease, ink, adhesives and dirt from machines, tools, materials and finished products.</P>
<P>Petroleum solvents contain volatile organic compounds, which combine with nitrogen oxides to form harmful ground-level ozone.</P>
<P>Industrial solvent cleaning now accounts for 36 tons per day of VOC emissions -- nearly three times that of all of the region's oil refineries.</P>
<P>The AQMD proposal would reduce VOC emissions from industrial cleaning compounds by 46%, or 20.5 tons per day by 2010.  It is one of the largest VOC emission-reduction rules remaining in AQMD's clean air plan to achieve federal health standards by 2010.</P>
<P>In addition to cleaning up the air, Lents said, water-based cleaners may significantly reduce waste disposal costs associated with petroleum solvents.</P>
<P>A number of low- and zero-VOC water-based cleaners are on the market today, and approximately one in five companies already use them, according to an AQMD survey completed this year.  Businesses using water-based cleaners found that they did a good job of removing grease and grime from machines, diesel fuel from construction equipment, and tar and asphalt from vehicles, according to the survey.</P>
<P>The rule would lower the VOC content of general cleaning solvents from today's limit of 900 grams per liter to 50 grams per liter by Jan. 1, 1999.</P>
<P>Businesses could comply with the rule by using water-based solvents or acetone -- a solvent that does not contribute to smog formation.</P>
<P>The rule would not apply to janitorial and institutional cleaning, including graffiti removal; dry cleaners; aerospace manufacturers, except for coating application equipment used by the industry; and semiconductor and other specialty manufacturers.</P>
<P>AQMD's board granted an extension of the compliance deadline until Jan. 1, 2001, for field cleaning of buses, trucks, tractors and other equipment.</P>
<P>The agency also agreed to a one-year study with the California Trucking Association to address that group's concerns regarding the use of aqueous cleaners in maintaining heavy-duty trucks.</P>
<CENTER><P><B>Cost Savings</B></P></CENTER>
<P>Businesses using water-based cleaners could save thousands of dollars in disposal fees because a portion of used water-based solutions may not need to be disposed of as hazardous waste.</P>
<P>An AQMD analysis estimated that the net savings to all Southland businesses from switching to water-based solvents would be about $4 million to $5 million a year.</P>
<CENTER><P><B>Clean Air Solvents</B></P></CENTER>
<P>The proposed rule also creates an incentive for using ultra-clean materials certified by AQMD as &quot;Clean Air Solvents.&quot;  Such solvents would have to meet even stricter requirements than the rule for volatility and smog-forming potential.</P>
<P>In addition, &quot;Clean Air Solvents&quot; cannot contain any compounds that are toxic, deplete the Earth's stratospheric ozone layer or contribute to global warming.</P>
<P>The use of &quot;Clean Air Solvents&quot; would save businesses even more money because the businesses would be exempt from the rule, would not be required to have a permit and would not incur any emission fees.</P>
<P>&quot;We want to encourage technological solutions such as 'Clean Air Solvents',&quot; Lents said, &quot;because they can help eliminate the need for any AQMD regulation of these businesses.&quot;</P>
<P>AQMD is the air pollution control agency for Los Angeles, Orange and portions of San Bernardino and Riverside counties.</P>

<CENTER><h2><P>NON-POLLUTING PAINTS</P></h2></CENTER>
<HR>
<P>A team of employees at Rockwell in Anaheim discovered a way to eliminate 1,500 pounds of smog-forming pollution a year while improving indoor air quality and increase productivity.</P>
<P>Their secret:  Switch from smelly, polluting paints to interior paint that contains no volatile organic compounds, or VOCs.</P>
<P>&quot;We now use no-VOC paints almost daily for all our interior wall painting,&quot; says Dick Clark, Rockwell's manager of environmental compliance.  &quot;The material coats better than traditional paints, has a less offensive odor, creates less costly waste and reduces our VOC emissions from the entire site by 25%.&quot;</P>
<P>The paint also has a faster drying time and leaves no odor, increasing productivity by displacing employees from painted areas for shorter periods of time.</P>
<P>Architects and interior designers also are taking note of non-polluting paints.  (See <A HREF="lehrer.html">accompanying story</A>)</P>
<P>Zero-VOC paints are an important tool in the war against smog, since house paints account for 60 tons per day of VOC emissions in the Southland -- considerably more than 44 tons per day of VOC emissions from all of the region's gas stations and oil refineries.</P>
<P>In an effort to reduce this health-threatening source of pollution, the South Coast Air Quality Management District's Governing Board will consider a measure in October to significantly reduce the VOC content of flat paints starting in 2001.</P>
<P>&quot;Some of us already paint our homes with low- or zero-polluting water-based paints,&quot; said James M. Lents, AQMD's executive officer.</P>
<P>&quot;By requiring paint manufacturers to reformulate their products, we can ensure that these clean air products are used throughout Southern California.&quot;</P>
<CENTER><P><B>The Pollution in Paint</B></P></CENTER>
<P>Paints are composed of three main ingredients: pigments, which gives them color and the ability to hide an underlying surface; resins, which bind pigments to the painted surface, and a carrier or solvent that keeps the paint in a liquid state so that it can be easily applied.</P>
<P>As paint dries, the carrier evaporates, leaving a film of coating.  Petroleum-solvent based paints contain a substantial amount of VOCs, which evaporate as paint dries.  These VOC fumes combine with nitrogen oxides, a combustion pollutant, to form ozone.  Ozone causes shortness of breath, kills lung cells and is suspected of causing premature aging of the lungs.</P>
<P>VOCs also contribute to the formation of particulate pollution, or PM10, which is linked to as many as 8,000 premature deaths a year in the South Coast Air Basin.</P>
<P>Since homeowners and painting contractors like to paint during good weather, VOC emissions from paint are highest during summer, when ozone pollution is at its worst.</P>
<P>Although the average VOC content of paint has fallen in recent years due to environmental regulations and increased market demand for low-VOC paints, total VOC emissions from house paints are expected to increase in the Southland due to population and housing growth.</P>
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="vocgraf.gif"  ALT="Undisplayed Graphic"></CENTER></P>
<P>AQMD along with state and federal air pollution control agencies have adopted a number of regulations to reduce emissions from business and industry, cars, trucks and even garden utility equipment.  If further measures are not adopted to control so-called &quot;area-wide sources,&quot; of which paints are a major component, by 2010 area-wide sources will become the dominant cause of smog-forming VOC emissions.</P>
<CENTER><P><B>No-Polluting Paint Now Widely Available</B></P></CENTER>
<P>Traditional petroleum solvent-based paints contain about 50% solvent by volume, and therefore have high VOC emissions.  In 1948, the Glidden Co., now part of ICI Paints, developed latex paint, which contains about 7% solvent and considerably less VOCs than traditional coatings.  In 1992, Glidden introduced the first zero-VOC paint, and the company now offers it in all colors for priming and painting interior surfaces with a &quot;flat&quot; (non-glossy), satin or semi-gloss finish.  Several other manufacturers, including Benjamin Moore Paints, Frazee Paints and NonToxiCA, also make zero-VOC coatings.  ICI Paints and NonToxiCA now market zero-VOC exterior paints in flat, satin and semi-gloss finishes.</P>
<CENTER><P><B>AQMD's Proposed Amended Rule 1113 -- Architectural Coatings</B></P></CENTER>
<P>On Oct. 11, AQMD's Governing Board is scheduled to consider an amendment to the agency's Rule 1113, which when fully implemented would reduce VOC emissions from paints by 10.6 tons per day.</P>
<P>The proposed requirements are summarized in the following table:</P>

<P>AQMD developed its rule proposal during an eight-month period that included several public workshops and six meetings with an industry working group composed of coatings manufacturers, painting contractors and trade group representatives.  AQMD staff extended the compliance deadlines for flat paints as a result of concerns raised by the working group.</P>
<P>AQMD will conduct technology assessments in 2000 and 2007 for flat coatings, and in 2003 for lacquers, to ensure that they can meet the lower VOC requirements.</P>
<CENTER><P><B>The New Age of No-Polluting Paints</B></P></CENTER>
<P>Low- and zero-VOC house paints already are in use throughout the country and the region.  A recent study showed that more than 40% of all flat paint sold in the state complies with AQMD's proposed VOC limits for 2001, and 12% already meets the agency's final limits proposed for 2008.</P>
<P>Hospitals, movie and television studios and other businesses like the zero-VOC paints because unlike petroleum solvent coatings, they have virtually no odor.</P>
<P>&quot;You can do touch-ups during the day when people are here and you can't smell a thing,&quot; says Diane Morrison, manager of the Gas Company's Energy Resource Center in Downey, a 45,000 square-foot-facility painted inside with no-VOC coatings.</P>
<P>The Gas Company also uses the no-polluting paints at its computer and customer service centers.</P>
<P>No-VOC paint is even used at the Happiest Place On Earth.  Disneyland's facility staff has applied several hundred gallons to interior walls and washrooms.</P>
<P>Businesses and consumers are moving toward zero-polluting paints because of their beneficial environmental qualities and lack of odor.  AQMD's proposal will help speed up the conversion to zero-polluting paints and accomplish a major emission reduction needed to meet air quality standards in the Southland.</P>

<H2>Bel Air House Showcases Green Design</H2></CENTER><BR><HR>
<P> When eyewear maker Keith Lehrer wanted to remodel his 8,000-square-foot 1950s-style Bel Air ranch house, Architect David Hertz envisioned a showcase in low-polluting and energy-efficient building elements.</P>
<center><img src = "house.gif"><h5>Model of the Lehrer residence, a 1950s-stye Bel Air ranch house that is being remodeled as a one-of-a-kind case study in low polluting and energy efficient building materials.  Zero-VOC paints are being used on the house. Photo courtesy of Syndeis.  Photography by Tom Bonner.</h5></center>
<P> Lehrer was interested but skeptical until Hertz penciled out the bottomline cost benefits of green design and construction.  &quot;My client is environmentally concerned.  I just needed to show him that sound environmental design could have significant economic paybacks,&quot; explained Hertz.</P>
<P> As president of Syndesis, a Santa Monica architectural studio specializing in creating sustainable strategies and environmental products, Hertz has been an active participant in the environmental design community for over a decade.  He sees business as the catalyst for ecological change.  &quot;I support author Paul Hawken's idea that in nature we see a perfectly balanced system -- one without waste.  Business can mimic nature and become more cost-efficient in the process,&quot; said Hertz.</P>
<P> Key among his environmental concerns was the air pollution normally associated with painting.  Hertz handled this in a number of ways, including use of new pollution-free paints that have come onto the market recently.</P>
<P> Paints are a leading source of air pollution in the region (<a href = "sepcover.html"><U>see accompanying story</U></a>), but new formulas promise to minimize this source of smog-forming emissions in the years ahead.</P>
<P> In getting started on the project, Hertz worked with construction-manager-turned-environmental-building-consultant John Picard of E2 Enterprises to develop a sourcebook for contractors on environmentally-friendly construction practices and products.</P>
<P> &quot;The book is an information exchange, an opportunity to record real field applications and understand how new products work,&quot; says Hertz.</P>
<P> The project manual lists options for environmentally sound products, finishes, paints, and systems used in the house construction.  It not only documents the work at the Lehrer residence, but provides source lists of recyclable, energy-efficient and non-toxic materials.</P>
<center><P><B>Paint Emissions Minimized</B></center></P>
<P> To minimize air pollution from paint, coatings were applied in a controlled environment to cut solvent emissions.  The paints used were minimal, with natural finishes preferred, but those that were used contained no volatile organic compounds or smog-forming compounds.</P>
<table><tr><td><img src = "paint.gif"><td><P> The master bedroom presented the acid test in painting, where white paint with an eggshell finish was specified and bright natural light from the expansive windows and reflecting off the glassy pool outside would make any imperfections obvious.  Two coats of Glidden's Spred 2000 zero-VOC product was used. &quot;It dries to the touch in twenty minutes, but it's durable.&quot; said house painter Greg Kosten.</P>
<P> Kosten added, &quot;I like knowing that the paint is safe for me.  I hate working with oil paint because I feel giddy at day&#146;s end -- especially when I work in closets or other tight spaces. But Glidden's Spred 2000 has no hazardous solvents.  You can tell because it has no smell.&quot;</P>
<P> The Glidden Co., now ICI Paints, surprised the interior paint world by offering a latex paint without any volatile organic compounds, or VOCs, in 1992.  VOCs in paints have been implicated in indoor air quality problems and environmental illnesses.  In the four-county area surrounding metropolitan Los Angeles, house painting produces more pollution on an average day than all of the area refineries and gas stations combined.</P></td><tr><td><h5>According to house painter Greg Kosten, Glidden's Spred 2000 zero-VOC product "dries to the rouch in twenty minutes, but it's durable"</h5></table>
<P><center><B>Recycled Materials Used</B></center></P>
<P> Use of recycled materials in the house was another green key.</P>
<P> Green design visionary John Picard constructed his own environmental dream house out of  the cars Angelenos drove in the 1960s, using recycled steel as the primary building material.   Hertz borrowed the idea, using recycled materials -- including bumpers, recycled carpet fibers or crushed compact disks  -- mixing them with cement in a special formula to produce a concrete-like substance called Syndecrete for tiles, countertops, alcoves and bathroom surfaces throughout the home. Cast in a mold and sanded to the right dimensions, Syndecrete requires no paint or additional exterior finishes.<p>
<table><tr><td><img src = "build.gif">
</td><td> Back in Bel Air at the Lehrer construction site, general contractor Michael MacDowell required subcontractors to bid environmentally-sensitive alternatives to traditional building products.  &quot;We started this project by dismantling the areas targeted for renovation and separating out the gutted wastes for recycling,&quot; said MacDowell pointing to douglas fir beams salvaged for later reuse in the remodel.</P>
<P> &quot;The entire Lehrer house employs materials which were less toxic and more resource efficient than those found in traditional construction practices, &quot; according to MacDowell, an 18-year veteran of the contracting trade.  The exterior uses natural wood and stucco which requires no painting and little continued maintenance.  No extraneous drywall, framing or painting was employed in the construction.  Even nails with recycled content were used.</P></td></tr><tr><td><h5>Architect David Hertz points out a special glaze on the windows, which reflects heat out and can cut energy bills by up to 40 percent</h5></td></tr>
</table>
<P> Open web steel and wood floor trusses from Trus Joist McMillan were used in the cavity between the first and second floors.  Air conditioning system supply ducts were easily routed through this opening rather than traditional routing through wall cavities or construction of internal soffits, which eat up resources and reduce living space.  &quot;This design feature cuts overall lumber requirements.  David liked the high-tech look of the open web steel trusses and factored them into the design,&quot;said Dede Ryan, Trus Joist McMillan's director of corporate communications.</P>
<P><center><B>Energy Efficiency Emphasized</B></center></P>
<P> Like a giant human lung allowing &quot;natural&quot; breathing of the house, a solar chimney releases hot air in the summer and recycles it through a heat recovery system in the winter.</P>
<P> High transommed windows screened on the outside provide natural ventilation with cool breezes from the nearby Stone Canyon Reservoir.  A heat-mirror glaze on the windows reflects the heat out, providing 80% light transparency with just 60% heat gain.  </P>
<P> &quot;The high-performance glass used in the house eliminates the need for 3 tons of otherwise required heating and air conditioning equipment,&quot; said Hertz.  &quot;This means no added equipment operating costs, no wasted square footage, no required maintenance, and reduced utility bills.&quot;</P>
<P> The house features an innovative HVAC system.  It is one of Carrier Corporation's first installations of residential air conditioning using HFC134A, a freon-like chemical which contains no chlorofluorocarbons.  </P>
<P> Chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, contain harmful chlorines which destroy the ozone layer.  Production of CFCs were banned by the Clean Air Act in the United States as of January 1, 1996.  Hydrochlorofluorocarbons, or HCFCs, contain just one-twentieth the ozone depletion value of CFCs but still contain chlorine.  In the early 1990s, a new refrigerant, hydrofluorocarbon, or HFC, was produced, which contains no chlorine at all.</P>
<P> An electronically controlled, programmable thermostat cools small, designated zones instead of the whole house. </P>&quot;This is an energy efficiency issue that is deep reaching when you think about it,&quot; said Jon Sandberg, director of communications at Carrier Corp.  &quot;You don't need the fossil fuels to produce the energy if you reduce your consumption.  That's exactly what this system allows you to do.&quot;</P>
<P> The combination furnace produces radiant heat for the house which travels through the flooring since no carpeting is used.  &quot;The system operates at 98% efficiency, unlike most heating systems in which close to 40% of the energy created is wasted output versus heat generated,&quot; said Rick Fedricci, director of environmental marketing at Carrier.</P>
<P> The unit is completely contained and directly vented outside, eliminating the potential for indoor air quality problems which may be experienced with flame-driven devices.  The system features heat recovery ventilators which exchange the air for fresh outdoor air seven times a day.</P>
<P><center><B>Green Finishing Touches Added</B></center></P>
<P> Low-flow shower heads, water-conserving toilets, faucet aerators, and water filtration devices also were specified in the design.  Hot water demands inside the house and for heating the swimming pool will be aided by a rooftop solar hot water heating system installed by the Scholfield Solar Co.  Energy-efficient compact fluorescent interior and exterior lighting also is planned.</P>
<P> Cellutex, an insulation made of recycled newsprint fibers, was used as an acoustical floor underliner  as well as recycled cotton batt insulation from Greenwood Cotton Insulation Products.</P>
<P> Several small-scale efforts helped to lay the groundwork for the environmental building design work fueled by the likes of  John Picard and David Hertz.  The eco-house of Julia Russell, nestled in Los Feliz, is one.  It came long before &quot;sustainable development&quot; was a popular buzzword.</P>
<P> &quot;As a mother of young children in the early 1970s, I became more aware of the environmental movement,&quot; said Russell.  &quot;I can see that our modern urban lifestyle is at the core of the environmental problems we face.  This revelation can be frustrating.  In my case it was empowering and I was determined to start at home to modify my everyday lifestyle to rely less on products that are destructive to the environment.&quot;</P>
<P> Russell recognized early on that environmental quality is a direct byproduct of our everyday lives.  She started making changes on a small scale and considers her environmental house forever in the making.  Sixteen years later her home includes xeriscaping -- native planting which is drought tolerant, low maintenance and requires little water -- composting, organic gardening, solar heating, ultra low-flush toilets and photovoltaic cells that power electric lights, as well as gray water from a washing machine that is used to irrigate fruit trees.</P>
<P> &quot;I guess the strength of what I've done,&quot; said Russell &quot;is it's simplicity.  It doesn't intimidate people on a limited budget.&quot;</P>
<P> &quot;Making our cities more sustainable will take a commitment from many communities -- Los Angeles architects, builders, urban planners, regulators, and average people looking around deciding what to do with their own homes.&quot; </P>

Proposed Amendments to Rule 1113 -- Architectural Coatings</H2></P>
<H3>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</H3></P></CENTER>
<HR>
<P> Rule 1113 - Architectural Coatings was originally adopted by the South Coast Air Quality Management District (AQMD) on September 2, 1977, to regulate the volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from the application of architectural coatings.  The VOC emissions from the use of architectural coatings were estimated at 54 tons per day in 1990 in the AQMD.  Based on the 1994 AQMP, a projection of these emissions for 1996 is approximately 60 tons per day.</P>
<P>The rule has been amended several times since the date of adoption, mostly to define specialty coating categories and exempt certain coatings from the 250 g/l exterior coating VOC limit and 350 g/l interior coating VOC limit.  In contrast to the earlier amendments, the rule was amended on February 2, 1990, to further reduce VOC emissions from certain, previously exempted coating categories.  The February 2, 1990, limits were based primarily on the California Air Resources Board (CARB) Suggested Control Measure (SCM) for Architectural and Industrial Maintenance (AIM) Coatings.  The provisions in the SCM were developed by a consortium of California air pollution control districts, CARB, United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Region IX, and paint manufacturers.  Upon adoption of the lower VOC limits, coating manufacturers filed a legal action against the District, and other air districts, over issues that they felt were not adequately addressed in the staff report or in the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) document.  The suit stayed portions of the February 1990 amendments as specified in the Superior Court judgment.  Subsequent rule amendments adopted November 1990, December 1990, September 1991, and March 1996 were not subject to the court judgment.</P>
<P>Based on the concept of reformulation of existing coatings, the current amendments propose lowering the VOC limits for some coating categories, increasing the VOC limit for other coating categories, reinstating VOC limits pursuant to the court order, and addressing issues raised since the September 6, 1991 amendments.  These include addition of and modification to some definitions, synchronizing final compliance dates for all coating categories, and updating the analytical test methods.</P>
<P>Proposed amendments to the definitions are as follows:</P>
<P><ul><li> Delete definitions of &#147;industrial maintenance coatings,&#148; &#147;industrial maintenance anti-graffiti coatings,&#148; and &#147;high-temperature industrial maintenance coatings,&#148; as required by the Superior Court judgment</P>
<P><li> Reinstate the definitions of &quot;quick-dry enamels&quot; and &quot;quick-dry primers, sealers, and undercoaters&quot; as defined in the January 1990 rule</P>
<P><li> Add new definitions for &quot;tub and sink repair coatings,&quot; &quot;fire-proofing coatings,&quot; &quot;japans,&quot; &quot;coating,&quot; &quot;reactive diluent,&quot; and &#147;flats&#148;</P>
<P><li> Modify and consolidate several definitions to enhance clarity</P>
<P><li> Delete unnecessary definitions</ul>
<P>The following VOC limits are proposed to be reinstated, pursuant to the Superior Court judgment:</P>
<P><ul><li> Reinstate the current VOC limits for industrial maintenance primers and topcoats at 420 g/l</P>
<P><li> Reinstate the current VOC limit for quick-dry enamels at 400 g/l</P>
<P><li> Conditionally removing VOC limits for quick-dry primers, sealers, and undercoaters.</ul>
<P>The following VOC limits are proposed to be modified:</P>
<P><ul><li> Reinstate the current VOC limit for lacquer at 680 grams of VOC per liter of coating less water and exempt solvent (g/l), and then lower it to 550 g/l, effective January 1, 1998, and to 275 g/l, effective January 1, 2005.  Conduct a technology assessment for feasibility of the 275 g/l limit by January 1, 2004.  Include an exemption for lacquers to add up to 10% retarder during cool, humid days</P>
<P><li> Lower the VOC limit for multi-color coatings from 420 g/l to 250 g/l, effective January 1, 1998</P>
<P><li> Lower the VOC limit for flats from 250 g/l to 100 g/l, effective July  1, 2001 and further reduce from 100 g/l to 50 g/l, effective July 1, 2008.  Conduct a technology assessment for feasibility by July 1, 2000 for the 100 g/l limit and by July 1, 2007 for the 50 g/l limit.  Include an averaging provision to allow manufacturers to average the VOC content of their flat coatings, on a sales weighted basis</P>
<P><li> Lower the VOC limit for traffic coatings from 250 g/l to 150 g/l, effective January 1, 1998</ul>
<P>Staff recommends the following amendments to increase the VOC limits for certain specialty coating categories that are currently under variance because they cannot comply with the current VOC limit:</P>
<P><ul><li> Set an interim VOC limit for exterior fire-proofing coating at 450 g/l and then lower the VOC limit to 350 g/l, effective January 1, 1999</P>
<P><li> Set an interim VOC limit for magnesite cement coatings at 600 g/l and then lower the VOC limit to 450 g/l, effective January 1, 1999</P>
<P><li> Set an interim VOC limit for japans at 450 g/l and then lower the VOC limit to 350 g/l, effective January 1, 1999</P>
<P><li> Set an interim VOC limit for tub and sink repair coatings at 420 g/l and then lower the VOC limit to 340 g/l, effective January 1, 1999</P>
</ul><P>In addition, staff has reorganized the Table of Standards coating categories into alphabetical order, eliminated coating categories that have been at the default 250 g/l limit of paragraph (c)(1) for at least three years, and consolidated similar categories with the same VOC limit.</P>
<P>The exemption for quick-dry primers, sealers and undercoaters will continue as a result of the Superior Court judgment, provided the manufacturer continues to submit to the Executive Officer annual reports of those coatings sold in the AQMD.</P>
<P>Lowering the VOC limits for flats, traffic, multi-color, and lacquers will achieve an emission reduction of 10.6 tons per day.  Offsetting these reductions will be an increase of 0.14 tons per day for japans, magnesite, tub &amp; sink repair, and fire-proofing coatings.</P>
<P>Therefore, the net reduction in VOC emissions is estimated to be 10.6 tons per day or approximately a 17.7 percent emission reduction compared to current emission levels.</P>

<TITLE>Reformulated Gas Helps Fuel Record Clean Air </TITLE>

<center><br><h2>Reformulated Gas Helps Fuel Record Clean Air </h2></center><p><hr>
<P><A NAME="I2"></A><I><U>Stage 1 Episode Days Cut in Half</U></I>

<P><A NAME="I4"></A>Southland air quality scientists credited reformulated gasoline with helping to cut the number of Stage 1 episode days in half and contributing to the cleanest year on record.
<P>This year's smog season has seen only seven Stage 1 ozone episode days, compared to 14 during all of last year, which was the cleanest year in a half century.  This marks the fifth year of continuous declines in pollution levels.
<P>These levels stand in stark contrast to 1986 when residents suffered through 80 Stage 1 episode days a year and 1977 with 121 episodes days.
<P>&quot;The continuing decline in smog episodes shows that our air pollution control programs are working,&quot; said James M. Lents, executive officer of the South Coast Air Quality Management District.  &quot;At this rate, Stage 1 ozone episodes will be extinct by the year 2000.&quot;
<P>Lents credited reformulated gasoline with helping to spur the drop in Stage 1 episode days.  The California Air Resources Board required the sale of reformulated gasoline starting June 1, though many refineries beat that deadline.
<P>&quot;Reformulated gasoline is one of the significant changes in our air quality program during the past year that has accounted for cutting the number of Stage 1 episodes in half,&quot; Lents said.
<P>Cleaner-burning, or reformulated gasoline, results in 15% fewer smog-forming emissions and a 30% to 40% reduction in cancer-causing pollutants, including benzene, according to the California Air Resources Board.

<center><h2>Stage 1 Ozone Episodes 1976-1996</h2><IMG SRC="smogwe0.gif">
<br><b>Source: South Coast Air Quality Management District<br>
During a Stage 1 episode, air quality is considered very unhealthful and<br> everyone should avoid vigorous outdoor exercise</b>
</center>
<P>Besides half as many Stage 1 episodes, this smog season also saw record low health advisories and days exceeding the federal health standard.  (See following tables.)

<CENTER><P><B>The Weather Factor</B></CENTER>

<P>This year will go down as another record clean smog season in spite of the fact that the spring was unseasonably hot, resulting in two back-to-back Stage 1 episodes, on May 11 and May 12, and the season's highest ozone level, 0.24 parts per million on May 11.  High temperatures fuel the photochemical reaction that produces ozone.  Overall, this summer's weather was normal, with June temperatures slightly cooler than normal, AQMD meteorologists said.

<CENTER><P><B>Reduced population exposure to smog</B></CENTER>

<P>Another encouraging sign in the war against smog is the steady decrease in the total number of hours that residents are exposed to unhealthful levels of ozone.
<P>Decreasing exposure to ozone has been most marked during weekdays.  Weekends continue to show a trend of slower improvement, and sometimes smoggier conditions than weekdays.  The pattern may be due to different driving patterns and greater use on weekends of consumer products, such as paints that contain smog-forming ingredients.
<P>The western and central portions of the Los Angeles basin, including the San Fernando and San Gabriel valleys, also have shown more rapid improvement in recent years than the far eastern portions of the basin, including the San Bernardino Valley, San Bernardino Mountains and Coachella Valley.  AQMD meteorologists will take a closer look at that trend at the end of this smog season.
<P><center><h2>Reduction in hours of ozone exposure</h2>
<IMG SRC="smogwe1.gif"><br><b>Source: South Coast Air Quality Management District.<br>  Measurements taken at 25 monitoring stations in<br> South Coast Air Basin through Aug. 31 each year</b></center>
<P>As fall advances, bringing fewer hours of sunlight and cooler temperatures, unhealthful ozone levels will cease -- until next spring.

 <br><h5>The Air Quality Management Plan Proposes 70 new rules which will reduce VOC emissions by 67% and NOx emissions by 57%.
The 30 marginal rules that are removed or deferred from the AQMP would have only yielded an additional 1% reduction in VOC emissions and less than 2% in NOx emissions.</h5>

<br>

<P> The latest draft clean air plan by the South Coast Air Quality Management District shows that the region is winning its quarter-century battle to meet federal clean air standards.</P>
<P> After two years of the region's most intensive scientific study of particulate pollution ever, the draft 1997 clean air plan shows that existing progress combined with a streamlined rule adoption program will meet all present federal air quality standards.</P>
<P> The 1997 draft clean air plan continues to propose most of the control measures outlined in the 1994 ozone plan with minor exceptions but postpones many marginal measures found to be less cost-effective, drops future indirect-source rules that are now deemed infeasible, and focuses the AQMD's efforts on about ten major emission-reduction rules over the next two years.</P>
<P> The AQMD now has better information about the chemistry and sources of smog and better computer models.  Thus, the agency is relying on better science than ever before.  In addition, AQMD's existing controls are working better than planned.  The region is winning the fight for clean air.</P>
<P> The good news for the public:  Air quality that complies with present federal health standards, once thought impossible here in the nation's most polluted urban area, is within sight. </P>
<P> The good news for businesses: The new draft plan contains no surprises, except for a couple pleasant ones:
<UL>
	<LI> The AQMD will focus its efforts on adopting seven major rules to reduce volatile organic compounds (VOCs), a key ingredient in smog;
	<LI> The plan includes new market-based measures giving businesses greater flexibility in meeting emission-reduction requirements, such as <!---HYPERLINK TO INTERCREDIT PRESS RELEASE--><A HREF="/news/icspr.html">intercredit trading</A> and additional credits for mobile source emission reductions; and
	<LI> While it retains 70 measures and an additional eight contingency measures, it defers 16 previously proposed rules deemed less cost-effective or otherwise infeasible at the present time, and drops five future indirect-source rules such as trip-reduction measures at shopping centers.</P>
</UL>
<P> The new AQMD clean air plan will go a long way toward removing regulatory uncertainty for businesses in our region and help foster economic growth.</P>
<CENTER><P><B>1997 Draft Clean Air Plan</B></P></CENTER>
<P> The AQMD is required under the state clean air act to update its clean air plan every three years.  </P>
<P> Release of the 1997 draft Air Quality Management Plan kicks off an extensive public review and comment  process on the plan, which may result in changes in the proposed document.</P>
<P> At meetings and<!--HYPERLINK TO WORKSHOP SCHEDULE--> workshops in September, AQMD will actively seek comments on the plan from the business and environmental communities, the public and state and federal agencies and make appropriate changes.</P>
<P> AQMD's Governing Board  will conduct a hearing in late October or early November to hear further public testimony and consider adopting the plan.  The region's clean air plan then must be reviewed and approved by the state Air Resources Board and forwarded to the federal EPA by February 1997 to meet federal deadlines for controlling fine particulates.</P>
<P> The draft 1997 plan shows that measures outlined in the 1994 ozone plan are more than sufficient to attain the federal minimum health standards for the two most difficult ingredients in smog, fine particulates and ground-level ozone, by the years 2006 and 2010, respectively.</P>
<P> The carbon monoxide standard will be met, as required, by 2000.  The region already has met the three other federal health standards for lead, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide.</P><CENTER><P><B>Ground-Level Ozone</B></P></CENTER>
<P> Since the battle against smog began nearly a half century ago, the chief concern has been ground-level ozone, an invisible pollutant formed when sunlight bakes a mixture of fumes from gasoline and paint, known as volatile organic compounds, and nitrogen oxides from the exhaust of vehicles and factories.</P>
<P> Only a handful of key rules reducing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from regulated businesses will be sought in the near-term, with progress to be re-evaluated later.  Only two nitrogen oxide (NOx) emission control rules for stationary sources currently are planned for AQMD adoption.</P>
<P> Those key proposed VOC rules, all outlined in the 1994 plan, are:
<UL>
	<LI> Rule 1171 covering solvent cleaning operations, which alone will provide more than half of the new stationary source VOC emission reductions required by 2005;
	<LI> Rule 1113 covering architectural coatings, such as paints and varnishes;
	<LI> Rule 1145 covering plastic, rubber and glass coating operations;
	<LI> Rule 1107 covering metal parts and products, and
	<LI> Rule 1138 covering restaurant charbroiler operations.
</UL>
<P> These five rules will more than make up for the emission reductions delayed when the proposed market-based rule for VOCs -- the Regional Clean Air Incentives Market -- was set aside.</P>
<P> The new draft plan underscores the dramatic progress made in reducing ozone pollution -- demonstrating that air pollution control measures to protect public health are working.</P>
<CENTER><P><B>Fine Particulate Pollution</B></P></CENTER>
<!--HYPERLINK TO PM10 COVER STORY--><A HREF="pm10cov.html">Fine particulate pollution</A>
 emerged as a major concern in the 1994 clean air plan, with medical studies showing that it causes more adverse health effects than ozone -- even as many as 8,000 premature deaths in the South Coast region each year, according to some sources.</P>
<P> Fears also arose in 1994 that controlling fine particulates, or PM10, might be more difficult and more costly than controlling ozone pollution.</P>
<P> Unlike the region's long history with ozone, scientific understanding of the chemistry behind fine particulates just a few years ago was fairly new and primitive.</P>
<P> To address these concerns, AQMD in 1994 committed to a two-year, $1.4 million joint study with other public agencies and local businesses involving intense monitoring of PM10 and improvements in the emissions inventory and computer modeling techniques.</P>

<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=8>

<IMG SRC="pm10.gif" BORDER=1 HEIGHT=250 WIDTH=177 ALIGN=LEFT VSPACE=10>
	</TD>
	<TD  VALIGN="center">

That study showed that additional measures beyond those outlined in the 1994 plan for dairies, the ports, airports, trains, trucks and the construction industry are unnecessary to meet present federal particulate standards.</P>
<P> The study has yielded the region's best scientific understanding of fine particulate pollution ever.  That's appropriate, since the Southland is among the nation's worst areas for fine particulate pollution.</P>
<P> To help reduce PM10 pollution, the 1997 draft plan outlines seven proposed control measures for directly emitted particulates which will reduce emissions from agricultural areas, livestock wastes, woodworking operations, construction and restaurants, and will help control dust from paved and unpaved roads, which accounts for two-thirds of the directly-emitted particulates.</TD>

</TR>
</TABLE>
In addition, proposed rules on VOC, NOx and ammonia emissions will assist in lowering particulate levels, since these gasses undergo a chemical reaction in the atmosphere to form particulates.</P>
<P>Tight standards proposed by the state for emissions of nitrogen oxides and soot from heavy-duty trucks and buses will be maintained under the plan.  Locally, improved street cleaning measures will help control road dust emissions.  Dairies in the Chino area will have to cut their emissions in half by 2004, although an ongoing trend of dairies moving out of the basin may eliminate the need for regulation.</P>
<CENTER><P><B>Marginal Rules Postponed Or Dropped</B></P></CENTER>
<P> With the draft 1997 plan's control measures concentrating on major rules, a number of other measures outlined in the 1994 plan will be postponed or in the case of future indirect-source measures, scrapped.</P>
<P> The principal reasons are that these measures yield only marginal emission reductions for the effort required to make the changes in business operations or have now been determined to be impractical or otherwise infeasible.</P>
<P> The improved scientific understanding of the region's pollution problem shows that the basin's carrying capacity is somewhat higher than the 1994 plan indicated.  This, coupled with a good hard look at cost-effectiveness and feasibility in light of new data, as well as how AQMD can help the region's economic recovery, prompted the decision to postpone marginal measures.</P>
<CENTER><P><B>Increasing Role of Area Sources</B></P></CENTER>
<P> The new draft plan underscores the increasing role of pollution from area-wide sources, including consumer products.  </P>
<P> As emissions from businesses and vehicles are reduced, these widespread and ubiquitous area-wide sources loom as an ever more important source of potential reductions of air pollution.</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="vocgraf.gif" WIDTH = 574 HEIGHT = 248 BORDER=1></CENTER><P>
<P> For example, area-wide sources are expected to grow from 29% of the region's total VOC emissions (391 tons per day) today to 47% (or 442 tons per day) by the year 2010.  Meanwhile, the Southland enjoys some of the cleanest industries and cars in the world.</P>
<CENTER><P><B>Future Uncertainties</B></P></CENTER>
<P> The federal Environmental Protection Agency is considering more stringent standards for both ozone and fine particulates.  These new standards potentially could require further emissions reductions.</P>
<P> While the AQMD won't know what those exact standards will be until they are announced, the EPA likely will give the nation's urban areas additional years to attain the new standards.</P>
<CENTER><P><B>Continued Progress Toward Clean Air</B></P></CENTER>
<P> The draft 1997 plan shows that both emissions and ambient pollution levels have continued their downward path toward healthful levels.  The number of stage I smog episodes for ozone declined from 41 days in 1990 to just 14 last year.  Carbon monoxide also has declined, with the number of days over the standard down from 42 in 1990 to 13 last year.  The average number of days exceeding the federal 24-hour PM10 standard also declined between 1990 and 1995 by 9%.</P>
<P> The draft plan shows that the air is improving because emissions are falling as planned control measures are implemented.  For example, from 1990 to 1993, the years used as the emissions planning baselines in the 1994 and 1997 plans, respectively, emissions of VOCs declined from  1,789 to 1,366  tons per day  and NOx emissions declined from 1,542 to 1,321 tons per day.</P>
<P> In addition, thanks to the intensive study of fine particulates, AQMD's 1997 draft plan shows that direct emissions of PM10 were 405 tons per day less than the 838 tons per day indicated in the 1994 plan.</P>
<P> The new clean air plan also shows that emissions of NOx and VOCs must be reduced from 1,321 and 1,366 tons per day, respectively, in 1993 to 688 and 684 tons per day in 2006 to meet the federal PM10 standards.</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="aqmpgrf1.gif" WIDTH = 566 HEIGHT = 268 BORDER=1 ALT="Undisplayed Graphic"></P>

<IMG SRC="aqmpgrf2.gif" WIDTH = 567 HEIGHT = 260 BORDER=1 ALT="Undisplayed Graphic"></CENTER></P>

<P> To meet the ozone standard by 2010, NOx and VOC emissions must be cut to 571 and 444 tons per day.</P>
<P> These final levels represent the basin's carrying capacities for meeting the federal PM10 and ozone standards.</P>
<P>-----------</P>
<P> Southland residents have been enjoying the cleanest air since pollution monitoring began and can look forward to continued improvement under this plan.</P>

<TITLE>1996 Regulatory Reforms</TITLE>

<IMG SRC="/icon/logo.gif" HEIGHT=75 WIDTH=53 ALIGN="LEFT" HSPACE="8">
<br><center><h2>AQMD COMPLETES 1996 REGULATORY REFORMS</h2></center><p><hr>


<P> The AQMD is expected to cement another building block in its 1996 Regulatory Reform Initiative this month when the Governing Board considers eliminating 10,000 air pollution control permits for low polluting equipment, saving businesses some $1.5 million a year.
<P> Launched in January, the <A HREF= "/news/mikels.html">1996 Regulatory Reform Initiative</A> outlines steps to ease the regulatory burden and improve the business climate in the region without harming progress towards cleaner air.  Virtually all of the reforms have been implemented over the past 10 months.
<P> &quot;We're achieving our air quality goals, but are also committed to minimizing paperwork and other requirements that don't really contribute to reducing smog,&quot; AQMD Chairman Jon Mikels said.
<P> &quot;We will continue to move forward in a balanced manner toward both clean air and regulatory reform in the year ahead.&quot;
<P> The reforms come amid the <A HREF="/monthly/smogweb.html">cleanest year on record</A> in the Southland since air quality monitoring began in the 1950s.  They also coincide with a stepped-up adoption of clean air regulations by AQMD's board.
<P> The AQMD&#146;s latest regulatory streamlining effort this month comes in the form of amendments to AQMD's <A HREF="/hb/96114a.html">Rule 219</A>, which lists equipment that does not require an air pollution control permit.
<P> Expected to be added to the list of exempt equipment are freon recycling equipment, small portable internal combustion engines, small paint spray booths, fuel oil storage tanks, powder coating ovens and other equipment that produces minimal pollution or is covered under other regulatory programs.  Freon recycling now is regulated by the federal EPA and small portable engines under a new California EPA registration program.
<P> This latest business-friendly step joins a growing list of measures AQMD has implemented this year under the 1996 initiative to save businesses money and improve the region's economy.  Other AQMD accomplishments have been to:
<UL>
<LI> Launch a highly successful <A HREF="/news/amnesty.html">amnesty program</A> for unpermitted equipment, encouraging businesses to obtain permits for 1,700 pieces of equipment and avoid normal late fees and penalties.<P>
<LI> Establish a &quot;Green Carpet&quot; service that allows major super-clean business expansion or relocation projects to obtain needed air pollution control permits on a fast-track basis;<P>
<LI> Begin consolidating permits for businesses with multiple permits into a single, facility-wide permit to simplify paperwork for permit-holders;<P></ul>
<table><tr><td><IMG SRC="money.gif" BORDER=1><td><ul><LI> Reduce its <A HREF="/finn/ysummary.html">budget</A> this fiscal year by 4.9% from $100.8 million to $95.8 million and reduce its staff by 32 positions from 796 to 764 in a continued effort to cut the agency's size, contingent upon continued progress toward clean air;</ul></table><P>
<ul><LI> Make it easier to get permits by placing permit applications on the AQMD's Internet Home Page and launch a <A HREF="/warp_main/">pilot program</A> for submitting completed permit application forms through the Internet; and<P></ul>
<table><tr><td><IMG SRC="vehicles.gif" BORDER=1><td><ul><LI> Support state programs to reduce pollution from motor vehicles -- the number one source of the region's smog problem -- including the state Air Resources Board&#146;s vehicle tailpipe standards.</ul></table>
</UL>
<P> Future reforms will expand the registration process for small equipment to provide simple guidelines to help ensure air pollution is minimized.<P><P>

<P> Then, AQMD plans to expand the registration concept to cover small businesses as a whole, including all their equipment.  A simplified facility registration will be developed for several industries, including auto body shops, dry cleaners, and others.  The goal of both registration programs is to make permitting and compliance easier for small businesses and to reduce their fees.
<H4><P><U>New Regulations Help Clean the Air</U></H4>
<P> In November, the board adopted new standards for architectural coatings used on homes, buildings and other structures.  These changes to AQMD's <A HREF="/news/paint1.html">Rule 1113</A> will require paint makers to move to zero-polluting flat paints by 2008 and to develop cleaner formulas for other coatings too.
<P> In September, the board adopted changes to AQMD's <A HREF="/news/solvent2.html">Rule 1171,</A> which covers myriad businesses that use solvents to clean machinery, tools and manufactured products.  Those amendments will require businesses to move to water-based cleaning solutions.  The board in September also tightened emissions standards for wastewater systems at oil refineries and chemical plants.
<P> Both 1113 and 1171 are major emission reduction rules and will go a long way toward cleaning the air when they go into effect.
<P> In addition, the Board in November unanimously adopted the AQMD&#146;s three-year update of its <A HREF="/news/aqmp.html">Air Quality Management Plan</A> for attaining present federal air quality health standards.
<P> When the federal EPA finalizes changes tightening those standards, Mikels said the AQMD will revise the plan to fully comply with the new health standards for ozone and fine particle pollution.
<H4><P><U>Emissions reductions yield better air quality.</U></H4>
<P> The region&#146;s successful cleanup efforts have resulted in a pronounced trend toward cleaner air.  The current ozone standard of .12 parts per million was exceeded on 87 days this year, almost half as many as ten years ago.  Only seven Stage I episode days -- when ozone exceeds .20 ppm -- were recorded this year compared to 79 in 1986 and 121 in 1977.
<P> The same trend continued with Health Advisories -- issued when ozone levels exceed .15 ppm -- with 52 this year compared to 140 ten years ago.  (For perspective, the highest ozone level recorded in this region was .68 ppm in 1955 compared to .24 ppm this year.)

<P>
<u>AAQS (Ambient Air Quality Standards)</u>:  Health and welfare based
standards for clean outdoor air that identify the maximum acceptable
average concentrations of air pollutants during a specified period
of time. (See NAAQS)
<P>
<u>Acute Health Effect</u>: An adverse health effect that occurs over
a relatively short period of time (e.g., minutes or hours).
<P>
<u>Aerosol</u>: Particles of solid or liquid matter that can remain suspended
in air for long periods of time because of extremely small size
and light weight.
<P>
<u>Air Pollutants</u>: Amounts of foreign and/or natural substances occurring
in the atmosphere that may result in adverse effects on humans,
animals, vegetation, and/or materials.
<P>
<u>Air Quality Simulation Model</u>: A computer program that simulates
the transport, dispersion, and transformation of compounds emitted
into the air and can project the relationship between emissions
and air quality.
<P>
<u>Air Toxics</u>: A generic term referring to a harmful chemical or
group of chemicals in the air. Typically, substances that are
especially harmful to health, such as those considered under EPA's
hazardous air pollutant program or California's AB 1807 toxic
air contaminant program, are considered to be air toxics. Technically,
any compound that is in the air and has the potential to produce
adverse health effects is an air toxic.
<P>
<u>Airborne Toxic Control Measure (ATCM)</u>: A type of control measure,
adopted by the ARB (Health and Safety Code Section 39666 et seq.),
which reduces emissions of toxic air contaminants from nonvehicular
sources.
<P>
<u>Alternative Fuels</u>: Fuels such as methanol, ethanol, natural gas,
and liquid propane gas that are cleaner burning and help to meet
ARB's mobile and stationary emission standards.
<P>
<u>Ambient Air</u>: The air occurring at a particular time and place
outside of structures. Often used interchangeably with &quot;outdoor&quot;
air.
<P>
<u>APCD (Air Pollution Control District)</u>: A county agency with authority
to regulate stationary, indirect, and area sources of air pollution
(e.g., power plants, highway construction, and housing developments)
within a given county, and governed by a district air pollution
control board composed of the elected county supervisors. (Compare
AQMD.)
<P>
<u>AQMD (Air Quality Management District)</u>: A group or portions of
counties, or an individual county specified in law with
authority to regulate stationary, indirect, and area sources of
air pollution within the region and governed by a regional air
pollution control board comprised mostly of elected officials
from within the region. (Compare APCD.)
<P>
<u>AQMP (Air Quality Management Plan)</u>: A Plan prepared by an APCD/AQMD,
for a county or region designated as a nonattainment area, for
the purpose of bringing the area into compliance with the requirements
of the national and/or California Ambient Air Quality Standards.
AQMPs are incorporated into the State Implementation Plan (SIP).
<P>
<u>ARB (California Air Resources Board)</u>: The State's lead air quality
agency, consisting of a nine-member Governor-appointed board.
It is responsible for attainment and maintenance of the State
and federal air quality standards, and is fully responsible for
motor vehicle pollution control. It oversees county and regional
air pollution management programs.
<P>
<u>Area-wide Sources (also known as &quot;area&quot; sources)</u>: Stationary
sources of pollution (e.g., water heaters, gas furnaces, fireplaces,
and wood stoves) that are typically associated with homes and
non-industrial sources. The CCAA requires districts to include
area sources in the development and implementation of the AQMPs.
<P>
<u>Atmosphere</u>: The gaseous mass or envelope surrounding the earth.
<P>
<u>Attainment Area</u>: A geographic area which is in compliance with
the National and/or California Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS
OR CAAQS).
<P>
<u>Attainment Plan</u>: In general, a plan that details the emission
reducing control measures and their implementation schedule necessary
to attain air quality standards. In particular, the federal Clean
Air Act requires attainment plans for nonattainment areas; these
plans must meet several requirements, including requirements related
to enforceability and adoption deadlines.
<P>
<u>BACT (Best Available Control Technology)</u>: The most up-to-date
methods, systems, techniques, and production processes available
to achieve the greatest feasible emission reductions for given
regulated air pollutants and processes. BACT is a requirement
of NSR (New Source Review) and PSD (Prevention of Significant
Deterioration). BACT as used in federal law under PSD is defined
as an emission limitation based on the maximum degree of emissions
reductions allowable taking into account energy, environmental
&amp; economic impacts and other costs. [(CAA Section 169(3)].
The term BACT as used in state law means an emission limitation
that will achieve the lowest achievable emission rates, which
means the most stringent of either the most stringent emission
limits contained in the SIP for the class or category of source,
(unless it is demonstrated that one limitation is not achievable)
or the most stringent emission limit achieved in practice by that
class in category of source. &quot;BACT&quot; under state law
is more stringent than federal BACT and is equivalent to federal
LAER (lowest achievable emission rate) which applies to NSR permit
actions.
<P>
<U>BAR (Bureau of Automotive Repair)</U>: An agency of the California
Department of Consumer Affairs that manages the implementation
of the motor vehicle Inspection and Maintenance Program.
<P>
<U>CAA (Federal Clean Air Act)</U>: A federal law passed in 1970 and
amended in 1977 and 1990 which forms the basis for the national
air pollution control effort. Basic elements of the act include
national ambient air quality standards for major air pollutants,
air toxics standards, acid rain control measures, and enforcement
provisions.
<P>
<U>CAAQS (California Ambient Air Quality Standards)</U>: Standards set
by the State of California for the maximum levels of air pollutants
which can exist in the outdoor air without unacceptable effects
on human health or the public welfare. These are more stringent
than NAAQS.
<P>
<U>CCAA (California Clean Air Act)</U>: A California law passed in 1988
which provides the basis for air quality planning and regulation
independent of federal regulations. A major element of the Act
is the requirement that local APCDs/AQMDs in violation of state
ambient air quality standards must prepare attainment plans which
identify air quality problems, causes, trends, and actions to
be taken to attain and maintain California's air quality standards
by the earliest practicable date.
<P>
<U>CEQA (California Environmental Quality Act)</U>: A California law
which sets forth a process for public agencies to make informed
decisions on discretionary project approvals. The process aids
decision makers to determine whether any environmental impacts
are associated with a proposed project. It requires environmental
impacts associated with a proposed project to be identified, disclosed,
and mitigated to the maximum extent feasible.
<P>
<U>CFCs (Chlorofluorocarbons)</U>: Any of a number of substances consisting
of chlorine, fluorine, and carbon. CFCs are used for refrigeration,
foam packaging, solvents, and propellants. They have been found
to cause depletion of the atmosphere's ozone layer.
<P>
<U>Chronic Health Effect</U>: An adverse health effect which occurs over
a relatively long period of time (e.g., months or years).
<P>
<U>CMB (Chemical Mass Balance)</U>: This receptor model is used for PM10
source apportionment, matching the measured chemical components
of the PM10 samples with known chemical profiles, or signatures,
of individual sources of PM10 particles. The 1995 PTEP enhanced
PM monitoring program results have been used to update the 1986
analysis used in previous AQMPs.
<P><u>
CO (Carbon Monoxide)</u>: A colorless, odorless gas resulting from
the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels. Over 80% of the CO
emitted in urban areas is contributed by motor vehicles. CO interferes
with the blood's ability to carry oxygen to the body's tissues
and results in numerous adverse health effects. CO is a criteria
air pollutant.
<P>
<u>Conformity</u>: Conformity is a process mandated in the federal Clean
Air Act to insure that federal actions do not impede attainment
of the federal health standards. General conformity sets out a
process that requires federal agencies to demonstrate that their
actions are air quality neutral or beneficial. Transportation
conformity sets out a process that requires transportation projects
that receive federal funding, approvals or permits to demonstrate
that their actions are air quality neutral or beneficial.
<P>
<u>Congestion Management Program</u>: A state mandated program (Government
Code Section 65089a) that requires each county to prepare a plan
to relieve congestion and reduce air pollution.
<P>
<u>Consumer Products</u>: Products such as detergents, cleaning compounds,
polishes, lawn and garden products, personal care products, and
automotive specialty products which are part of our everyday lives
and, through consumer use, may produce air emissions which contribute
to air pollution.
<P>
<u>Contingency Measure</u>: Contingency measures are statute-required
back-up control measures to be implemented in the event of specific
conditions. These conditions can include failure to meet interim
milestone emission reduction targets or failure to attain the
standard by the statutory attainment date. Both state and federal
Clean Air Acts require that District plans include contingency
measures.
<P>
<u>Electric Motor Vehicle</u>: A motor vehicle which uses a battery-powered
electric motor as the basis of its operation. Such vehicles emit
virtually no air pollutants. Hybrid electric motor vehicles may
operate using both electric and gasoline powered motors. Emissions
from hybrid electric motor vehicles are also substantially lower
than conventionally powered motor vehicles.
<P>
<u>EMFAC</u>: The EMission FACtor model used by ARB to calculate on-road
mobile vehicle emissions. This model is part of ARB's overall
on-road mobile source Mobile Vehicle Emission Inventory (MVEI)
model. The 1997 AQMP is based on the latest version of EMFAC and
MVEI, which is 7G. (The 1994 AQMP was based on the previous version,
EMFAC7F.)
<P>
<u>Emission Inventory</u>: An estimate of the amount of pollutants emitted
from mobile and stationary sources into the atmosphere over a
specific period such as a day or a year.
<P>
<u>Emission Offset (also known as an emission trade-off)</u>: A rule-making
concept whereby approval of a new or modified stationary source
of air pollution is conditional on the reduction of emissions
from other existing stationary sources of air pollution. These
reductions are required in addition to reductions required by
BACT.
<P>
<u>Emission Standard</u>: The maximum amount of a pollutant that is allowed
to be discharged from a polluting source such as an automobile
or smoke stack.
<P>
<u>EPA (Environmental Protection Agency)</u>: The United States agency

and population) through some specified point in time, and which
provides recommendations for local governments to better manage
growth and reduce projected environmental impacts.
<P>
<u>Hydrocarbon</u>: Any of a large number of compounds containing various
combinations of hydrogen and carbon atoms They may be emitted
into the air as a result of fossil fuel combustion, fuel volatilization,
and solvent use, and are a major contributor to smog. (Also see
VOC.)
<P>
<u>Indirect Source</u>: Any facility, building, structure, or installation,
or combination thereof, which generates or attracts mobile source
activity that results in emissions of any pollutant (or precursor)
for which there is a state ambient air quality standard. Examples
of indirect sources include employment sites, shopping centers,
sports facilities, housing developments, airports, commercial
and industrial development, and parking lots and garages.
<P>
<u>Indirect Source Control Program</u>: Rules, regulations, local ordinances
and land use controls, and other regulatory strategies of air
pollution control districts or local governments used to control
or reduce emissions associated with new and existing indirect
sources.
<P>
<u>Inspection and Maintenance Program</u>: A motor vehicle inspection
program implemented by the BAR. It is designed to identify vehicles
in need of maintenance and to assure the effectiveness of their
emission control systems on a biennial basis. Enacted in 1979
and strengthened in 1990. (Also known as the &quot;Smog Check&quot;
program.)
<P>
<U>LEV (Low Emission Vehicle)</U>: A vehicle which is certified to meet
the ARB 1994 emission standards for low emission vehicles.
<P>
<U>Maintenance Plan</U>: In general, a plan that details the actions
necessary to maintain air quality standards. In particular, the
federal Clean Air Act requires maintenance plans for areas that
have been redesignated as attainment areas.
<P>
<U>Mobile Sources</U>: Sources of air pollution such as automobiles,
motorcycles, trucks, off-road vehicles, boats and airplanes. (Contrast
with stationary sources.)
<P>
<U>NAAQS (National Ambient Air Quality Standards)</U>: Standards set
by the federal EPA for the maximum levels of air pollutants which
can exist in the outdoor air without unacceptable effects on human
health or the public welfare.
<P>
<U>Nitrogen Oxides (Oxides of Nitrogen, NOx)</U>: A general term pertaining
to compounds of nitric acid (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and
other oxides of nitrogen. Nitrogen oxides are typically created
during combustion processes, and are major contributors to smog
formation and acid deposition. NO2 is a criteria air pollutant,
and may result in numerous adverse health effects; it absorbs
blue light, resulting in a brownish-red cast to the atmosphere
and reduced visibility.
<P>
<U>NonAttainment Area</U>: A geographic area identified by the EPA and/or
ARB as not meeting either NAAQS or CAAQS standards for a given
pollutant.
<P>
<U>NSR (New Source Review)</U>: A program used in development of permits
for new or modified industrial facilities which are in a nonattainment
area, and which emit nonattainment criteria air pollutants. The
two major requirements of NSR are Best Available Control Technology
and Emission Offset.
<P>
<u>Ozone</u>: A strong smelling, pale blue, reactive toxic chemical gas
consisting of three oxygen atoms. It is a product of the photochemical
process involving the sun's energy. Ozone exists in the upper
atmosphere ozone layer as well as at the earth's surface. Ozone
at the earth's surface causes numerous adverse health effects
and is a criteria air pollutant. It is a major component of smog.
<P>
<u>Ozone Precursors</u>: Chemicals such as hydrocarbons and oxides of
nitrogen, occurring either naturally or as a result of human activities,
which contribute to the formation of ozone, a major component
of smog.
<P>
<u>Permit</u>: Written authorization from a government agency (e.g.,
an air quality management district) that allows for the construction
and/or operation of an emissions generating facility or its equipment
within certain specified limits.
<P>
<u>PIC (Particle-in-Cell) Model</u>: An air quality simulation model
that is used to apportion sulfate and nitrate PM10 concentrations
to their precursor emissions sources. The PIC model uses spatially
and temporally resolved sources of NOx and SOx emissions, with
meteorological, physical, and simplified chemical processes, to
calculate the contributions from various emission source categories.
<P>
<u>PM (Particulate Matter)</u>: Solid or liquid particles of soot, dust,
smoke, fumes, and aerosols.
<P><u>
PM10 (Particulate Matter less than 10 microns)</u>: A major air pollutant
consisting of tiny solid or liquid particles of soot, dust, smoke,
fumes, and aerosols. The size of the particles (10 microns or
smaller, about 0.0004 inches or less) allows them to easily enter
the air sacs in the lungs where they may be deposited, resulting
in adverse health effects. PM10 also causes visibility reduction
and is a criteria air pollutant.
<P>
<u>PM2.5 (Particulate Matter less than 2.5 microns)</u>: A major air
pollutant consisting of tiny solid or liquid particles, generally
soot and aerosols. The size of the particles (2.5 microns or smaller,
about 0.0001 inches or less) allows them to easily enter the air
sacs deep in the lungs where they may cause adverse health effects,
as noted in several recent studies. PM2.5 also causes visibility
reduction, but is not considered a criteria air pollutant at this
time.
<P>
<u>PSD (Prevention of Significant Deterioration)</u>: A program used
in development of permits for new or modified industrial facilities
in an area that is already in attainment. The intent is to prevent
an attainment area from becoming a non-attainment area. This program,
like NSR, can require BACT and, if an AAQS is projected to be
exceeded, Emission Offsets.
<P>
<u>PTEP (PM10 Technical Enhancement Program)</u>: A cooperative study
to improve the technical knowledge base for PM10, particularly
ambient PM measurements (mass and composition), improved emission
inventory estimates, and improved PM modeling tools.
<P>
<u>Public Workshop</u>: A workshop held by a public agency for the purpose
of informing the public and obtaining its input on the development
of a regulatory action or control measure by that agency.
<P>
<u>RME (Regional Mobility Element)</u>: The Regional Mobility Element
(RME) is the principal transportation policy, strategy, and objective
statement of the Southern California Association of Governments,
proposing a comprehensive strategy for achieving mobility and
related air quality mandates. The impacts of RME are included
in the AQMP.
<P>
<u>ROG (Reactive Organic Gas)</u>: A reactive chemical gas, composed
of hydrocarbons, that may contribute to the formation of smog.
Also sometimes referred to as Non-Methane Organic Compounds (NMOCs).
(Also see VOC.)
<P>
<u>SIP (State Implementation Plan)</u>: A document prepared by each state
describing existing air quality conditions and measures which
will be taken to attain and maintain national ambient air quality
standards (see AQMP).
<P>
<u>Smog Check Program</u>: (See Inspection and Maintenance Program.)
<P>
<u>Smog</u>: A combination of smoke, ozone, hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides,
and other chemically reactive compounds which, under certain conditions
of weather and sunlight, may result in a murky brown haze that
causes adverse health effects. The primary source of smog in California
is motor vehicles.
<P>
<u>Smoke</u>: A form of air pollution consisting primarily of particulate
matter (i.e., particles). Other components of smoke include gaseous
air pollutants such as hydrocarbons, oxides of nitrogen, and carbon
monoxide. Sources of smoke may include fossil fuel combustion,
agricultural burning, and other combustion processes.
<P>
<u>SO2 (Sulfur Dioxide)</u>: A strong smelling, colorless gas that is
formed by the combustion of fossil fuels. Power plants, which
may use coal or oil high in sulfur content, can be major sources
of SO2. SO2 and other sulfur oxides contribute to the problem
of acid deposition. SO2 is a criteria pollutant.
<P>
<u>Stationary Sources</u>: Non-mobile sources such as power plants, refineries,
and manufacturing facilities which emit air pollutants. (Contrast
with mobile sources.)
<P>
<u>Toxic Air Contaminant</u>: An air pollutant, identified in regulation
by the ARB, which may cause or contribute to an increase in deaths
or in serious illness, or which may pose a present or potential
hazard to human health. TACs are considered under a different
regulatory process (California Health and Safety Code Section
39650 et seq.) than pollutants subject to CAAQS. Health effects
due to TACs may occur at extremely low levels, and it is typically
difficult to identify levels of exposure which do not produce
adverse health effects.
<P>
<u>Transportation Control Measure (TCM)</u>: Any control measure to reduce
vehicle trips, vehicle use, vehicle miles traveled, vehicle idling,
or traffic congestion for the purpose of reducing motor vehicle
emissions. TCMs can include encouraging the use of carpools and
mass transit.
<P>
<u>UAM (Urban Airshed Model)</u>: The three-dimensional photochemical
grid model used to simulate ozone formation. Used to project episodic
ozone concentrations. (See also air quality simulation model.)
<P>
<u>UAM/Aero (Urban Airshed Model with Aerosol Chemistry)</u>: A three-dimensional
photochemical grid model used to simulate PM and ozone formation,
based on the UAM. Additional chemical mechanism modules are used
to simulate PM aerosol components. Used to project episodic PM
concentrations.
<P>
<u>UAM/LC (Urban Airshed Model with Linear Chemistry)</u>: A three-dimensional
photochemical grid model used to simulate PM formation, particularly
particulate sulfates and nitrates. The complex, non-linear chemical
mechanism used in UAM and UAM/Aero is replaced by a simplified,
linear chemistry that uses empirical relationships to determine
particulate nitrate and sulfate levels. Used to project annual
average PM component concentrations.
<P>
<u>Visibility</u>: The distance that atmospheric conditions allow a person
to see at a given time and location. Visibility reduction from
air pollution is often due to the presence of sulfur and nitrogen
oxides, as well as particulate matter.
<P>
<u>VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds)</u>: Hydrocarbon compounds that
exist in the ambient air. VOCs contribute to the formation of
smog and/or may themselves be toxic. VOCs often have an odor,
and some examples include gasoline, alcohol, and the solvents
used in paints.

<P>The AQMD this month launches a new dimension in its continuing commitment to regulatory reform to streamline and simplify the process of complying with air quality requirements -- AND to make it easier to do business in the South Coast Basin.
<P>Among the new business services and features offered starting Oct. 1 are:
<P><UL><LI>   Expedited permit processing;
<LI>   A new &quot;On-line Shop Talk&quot; providing information tailored to specific types of small businesses, starting this month with Autobody Repair Shops meet air quality standards; and 
<LI>   Expanded business features on this Website to provide more helpful information to our business customers.</UL><p>
<A NAME="E9E1"></A>
<center><B>Expedited Permit Processing</B></center>
<P>First, our innovations in permit processing are aimed at making it easier and faster for businesses to obtain necessary permits.
<P>Beginning today, some permit application forms will be accessible and downloaded from this Internet Website.  Within weeks, all AQMD forms will be both viewable and downloadable.  
<P>Even more exciting, some industries soon will be able to fill out and submit permit application forms over the Internet.  A pilot program has been developed for a limited number of common types of equipment and is being tested with focus groups of business representatives.
<P>Meanwhile, the forms themselves have been simplified and reduced in number, and new, easier-to-understand instructions developed.  Convenient checklists are now available to help permit applicants determine which forms to fill out and ensure that the information is complete and correct -- the chief reason for delays in obtaining permits.
<P>More feedback has been built into the process.  Businesses will be notified if their permit application is complete or if more information is needed.  And they will be provided the name of their AQMD contact to check on the status of their permit.  
<P>Over-the-counter service is being expanded in the Lobby of AQMD&#146;s Diamond Bar headquarters.  There, applicants can get answers to technical questions, help in filling out forms and, in some cases, even obtain over-the-counter permits in less than an hour.
<P>The AQMD is dedicated to promptly reviewing permit applications and letting businesses know when the application is complete, or if information is missing, and who is in charge of processing the application.
<A NAME="E9E2"></A><p>
<center><B>On-line Shop Talk</B></center>
<P>Now for our pilot &quot;<U><a href = "/business/absig.html">On-line Shop Talk</a></U>&quot; feature.
<P>In a further enhancement of AQMD's service to business, Executive Officer James Lents directed the Public Advisor's Small Business Assistance Office to develop a pilot program to provide assistance to specific small businesses electronically.
<P>The first industry to benefit from this new service will be region's 4,000 autobody shops, half of which are subject to AQMD regulations because of their paint finishing operations.
<P>AQMD's &quot;On-line Shop Talk&quot; special interest section for Autobody Shop Operations can help because it lays out in concise, plain language which AQMD rules affect these shops and how to comply.  It also explains what an AQMD inspector looks for during an inspection.  Users can download an easy-to- understand check-list and post it at their facility as a ready reference.
<P>Another unique new feature of this site is the Question-and-Answer section.  User questions will be researched by staff and posted along with the answers.  Viewers can ask questions or offer suggestions.  Ideas on how AQMD can better serve shops are encouraged and always welcome.  This area will become an important discussion forum for all air quality issues of concern to shops.<P>AQMD soon will have &quot;On-line Shop Talk&quot; features on this site for other specific industry types.  Plans are under way for an electronic newsletter directly E-mailed to subscribers covering new processes, product changes and other industry information.
<P>AQMD's Public Advisor and Small Business Assistance Office long has offered at no cost an &quot;in-house&quot; consulting service.  Thousands of small businesses have turned to the office over the years for personalized help in maneuvering through the complex air quality regulation process.
<P>Now that small businesses are beginning to turn to the information highway, and realize the opportunities it offers to help run more efficiently, AQMD is responding by providing specific industries access to the information they need and that affects them directly. 
<P>The AQMD&#146;s Website is like having an information kiosk in your own home or business, providing worldwide access to smog data, rules and regulations, and a myriad of related information and services.
<P><B>Other New Features on AQMD&#146;S Home Page</B>
<P><B>Revised equipment-specific permit application forms available for downloading</B>
<ul><li> Former 400-C forms are replaced by streamlined, consolidated 400-E forms.
</ul><P><B>Permits</B>
<ul><li> General information about permit application processing and permit issuance, links to Certified Permitting Professional program, Certification/Registration program;
<li> General information about AQMD fees, and
<li> Additional items available for viewing/downloading:
<li> Application Checklist;
<li> Fee Calculation Worksheet;
<li> Comprehensive table linking fees, equipment, rules, and BCAT numbers, and 
<li> Correspondence table linking former 400-C forms to new 400-E forms.
</ul><P><B>Compliance guidelines</B>

<a name = "gas"><P><h3>Reformulated Gas Helps Fuel Record Clean Air in Southland</h3>
<P><A NAME="I2"></A>Southland air quality scientists credited reformulated gasoline with helping to cut the number of Stage 1 episode days in half and contributing to the cleanest year on record.
<P>This year's smog season ended with only seven Stage 1 ozone episode days, compared to 14 during all of last year, which was the cleanest year in a half century.  This marks the fifth year of continuous declines in pollution levels.
<P>These levels stand in stark contrast to 1986 when residents suffered through 80 Stage 1 episode days a year and 1977 with 121 episodes days.
<P>&quot;The continuing decline in smog episodes shows that our air pollution control programs are working,&quot; said James M. Lents, executive officer.  &quot;At this rate, Stage 1 ozone episodes will be extinct by the year 2000.&quot;
<P>Lents said reformulated gasoline helped spur the drop in Stage 1 episode days.  The California Air Resources Board required the sale of reformulated gasoline starting June 1, though many refineries beat that deadline.
<P>&quot;Reformulated gasoline is one of the significant changes that has occurred in our air quality program during the past year to account for cutting the number of Stage 1 episodes in half,&quot; Lents said.
<P>Cleaner-burning, or reformulated gasoline, results in 15% fewer smog-forming emissions and a 30% to 40% reduction in cancer-causing pollutants, including benzene, according to the California Air Resources Board.

<P><a name = "bill"><h3><B>Governor Signs Bill Changing Rule 2202 to Exempt Firms of Up to 249 Workers</B></h3>
<P>Gov. Pete Wilson has signed into law a bill exempting 2,730 Southland employers with up to 249 employees from motor vehicle emissions reduction requirements under AQMD's Rule 2202.
<P>The bill -- SB 836 authored by state Sen. John Lewis (R-Orange) -- exempts the employers beginning Jan. 1.  There will be an 18 month trial period to see if a voluntary carpooling program can achieve equivalent emission reductions.  Regional rideshare agencies, in concert with the AQMD, will put into place an active voluntary rideshare program.
<P>Until now, Rule 2202 has required some 4,300 area employers of 100 or more employees at a worksite to reduce vehicle emissions through rideshare strategies, old vehicle scrapping or other programs.
<P>The new law calls for replacing mandatory vehicle emission reduction programs at those firms with a voluntary regional rideshare effort.
<P>It requires AQMD to provide $1.5 million a year to a coalition of regional transportation agencies to market voluntary rideshare services.
<P>If these voluntary efforts reduce emissions as much as the former mandatory measure, then the program will be expanded to exempt firms with up to 499 employees at a worksite.  If that effort is successful, Rule 2202 could be repealed by June 1, 2001.
<P>If voluntary efforts are unsuccessful, AQMD would have to find other equivalent measures.
<P>For more information, contact AQMD's Director of Transportation Programs Catherine Wasikowski at (909) 396-3264.

<P><a name = "34"><h3><B>Thirty-four Air Quality Bills Become Law Jan. 1</B></h3>
<P> After the close of an active legislative session in Sacramento, 34 air quality-related bills will become law on January 1, a dozen of which will affect AQMD.
<P> Of all the bills passed, SB 836 (Lewis) will have the most significant and immediate impact.
<P> Under SB 836, the employee threshold for companies subject to Rule 2202 will rise from 100 workers per site to 250 on January 1, 1997 <I>(see related story on page 1).</I>
<P> In addition to SB 836, other bills affecting AQMD that will become law January 1, 1997 include:
<P><ul><li> <B>AB 564 (Cannella): </B> Converts the toxic hot spots program to a maintenance level effort, eliminates annual fee and reporting requirements for medium-priority facilities, replaces it with a four-year reporting cycle and $125 fee;
<P><li> <B>AB 2937 (Brulte):  </B>Requires air districts to define difference between &quot;minor&quot; and &quot;major&quot; violations and adopt regulations creating fix-it tickets for minor offenses;
<P><li> <B>AB 2666 (Knight):  </B>Moves Antelope Valley area out of South Coast Air District to become Antelope Valley Air Pollution Control District on July 1, 1997; and
<P><li> <B>SB 2170 (Mountjoy):  </B>Requires air districts to allow use of computer data storage for emissions monitoring and recordkeeping; repeals current law authorizing South Coast to restrict variances from certain rules.</ul>
<P> Gov. Wilson vetoed <B>AB 2282 (Knox)</B> which would have allowed certified low-emission and electric vehicles to use carpool lanes regardless of the number of passengers.  AQMD supported the bill believing the additional access would encourage the purchase of electric vehicles.
<P> However, in his veto message, the Governor said carpool lanes are intended for congestion management and allowing solo drivers of clean fuel vehicles would be an exception to this use.

<P><a name = "rules"><h3><B>AQMD Adopts New Rules Reducing 23 Tons Per Day of Pollution</B></h3>
<P>AQMD's Governing Board this fall adopted two new rules that will reduce smog-forming emissions from solvents and industrial wastewater systems by a total of more than 23 tons per day in 2010.
<P>The measures represent the largest volatile organic compound reductions since rules adopted in 1988.  They are:
<P><li> Amended Rule 1171, Cleaning Solvents --  This rule will virtually eliminate, by 1999, volatile organic compounds in industrial cleaning products, saving businesses money and significantly reducing smog-forming emissions.
<P>The rule should save businesses money because water-based cleaners are usually cheaper to buy and use than petroleum solvent-based products.  Industrial solvent cleaning now accounts for 36 tons per day of VOC emissions -- nearly three times that of all the region's oil refineries.
<P>The measure will require a reduction in the VOC content of general cleaning solvents from today's limit of 900 grams per liter to 50 grams per liter by Jan. 1, 1999.  That will reduce VOC emissions from industrial cleaning compounds by 46%, or 20.5 tons per day by 2010.  <I>For more information, call Anupom Ganguli at (909) 396-3185</I>.
<P><li> Amended Rule 1176, Wastewater Systems</B> -- This rule will reduce VOC emissions from industrial wastewater systems at oil refineries, oil production fields, chemical plants and other facilities by 3.0 tons per day by 2000.  <I>For more information, call Mohsen Nazemi at </I><I>(909) 396-2662</I>.
<P>A third measure adopted in October, Rule 1605, will allow firms to earn emission reduction credits by using remote sensing to identify and repair high-emitting vehicles.  Emission reductions must be surplus to those required under the state's Smog Check program.  <I>For </I><I>more information on Rule 1605, call David Coel at (909) 396-3143</I>.

<P>Keeping a daily log of their 2,240-mile journey, NGV/USA President, John Case traveled the southern route across the United States from Los Angeles to Atlanta with project manager Mark Shandrow this September to test the performance of a van with a chassis system redesigned to extend the range of natural gas vehicles.
<P>&quot;Increasing the range of natural gas vehicles will be key to their commercial success,&quot; said Chung Liu, assistant deputy executive officer for technology advancement.  &quot;That's why AQMD has supported this demonstration project.&quot;
<P>Onlookers in Albuquerque were skeptical when the two-man crew pulled in to refuel their CNG van and pledged a drive straight through to El Paso. They made the 263-mile trip without a hitch since their Dodge Ram was designed to double the range of normal CNG-fueled vehicles.  In fact, the van can go more than 350 miles without refueling.
<P>Because four large compressed natural gas cylinders were built into the LongRanger's frame,  the vehicle can store an equivalent of 27 gallons versus 11 gallons of fuel for traditional 2-cylinder configurations.
<P>The $900,000 prototype chassis system was developed by NGV/USA, a Long Beach-based transportation development firm, working in partnership with CALSTART and a team of private firms and public agencies, including AQMD, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, Chrysler, Gas Research Institute, and Southern California Gas Co.
<P>According to Daniel Gurney, Senior Engineer with the National Institute for Petroleum and Energy Research , a DARPA contractor on the LongRanger, the project was designed to remove impediments to the use of natural gas by proving that it can go the distance. &quot;Sometimes very fundamental things end up helping us to make great advances,&quot; said Gurney.  &quot;This CNG multi-fuel chassis design may just solve the range problem.&quot;
<P>NGV/USA plans to commercialize the special chassis design offering it to the OEM market for mass development.

<P><B>CNG Worldwide</B>
<P>Some 40,000 CNG vehicles are on the road today in the U.S.   NGVs have a long-established record in Italy, where natural gas had been used as a fuel since the 1940s.  In Canada, 30,000 NGVs operate with a network of 125 public refueling stations.  Argentina has 285,000 NGVs and Russia has more than 300,000 with plans to convert to 1,00,000 throughout this decade.
<P><B>Stats on Natural Gas</B>
<P><ul><li>   Burns twice as clean as gasoline and is 30 percent cheaper.
<li>   A 65-year supply is available in the United States.
<li>   Costs 15 to 50 percent less than gasoline.

<li>  Reduces vehicle maintenance -- with oil changes needed only every 10,000 to 20,000 miles.  Standard spark plugs last as long as 75,000 miles.
<li>1,100 natural gas refueling stations operate in 46 states and the District of Columbia.

<IMG SRC="ev1.gif">
<td>AQMD's Governing Board has approved General Motors as the first qualified auto manufacturer in a program to provide Southland motorists with a $5,000 discount when buying or leasing an electric vehicle.
<P>AQMD approved GM's EV-1 this fall as a qualified vehicle for the $7 million Quick Charge program, which is aimed at jump-starting the commercialization of electric vehicles in Southern California.  While GM is the first automaker to qualify a vehicle, others are expected to apply before the July 1, 1997, deadline.</table>
<P>To be eligible for the Quick Charge program, auto manufacturers must demonstrate that their vehicles meet strict performance and safety standards and that they can provide adequate service and support for their them.

<P>The program will provide a $5,000 discount toward the purchase or lease of an EV for 1,200 buyers, for a total of $6 million.  An additional $1.6 million has been set aside for the EV Corridor Communities Program to help develop charging stations and other infrastructure needed along major routes for electric vehicles.
<P>GM officials have said they plan to offer the EV-1 electric vehicle for lease through Southland Saturn showrooms this fall.  The Quick Charge program is sponsored by the Mobile Source Air Pollution Reduction Review Committee, an organization funded by vehicle registration fees.

<P><a name = "bus"><h3><B>Zero-Polluting Bus Visits Southland</B></h3>
<P> A pollution-free bus sponsored by AQMD made the rounds in Southern California in late September and early October, drawing substantial interest from local transit districts.
<P> With support from AQMD, Ballard Power Systems Inc. of Vancouver, Canada, developed the full-scale public transit bus.  It is powered by a hydrogen-fed fuel cell that produces electricity to run the vehicle's electric motor and emits only steam.
<P> &quot;We sponsored development of this pollution-free bus because fuel cells are one of the main technologies needed to achieve healthful air in Southern California,&quot; said Leonard Paulitz, a member of both AQMD's Governing Board and the Montclair City Council.
<P> &quot;Buses and other heavy-duty vehicles are a major source of the fine particulate pollution in our area.  Newer, cleaner sources of energy for transportation, such as fuel-cell powered buses, are important solutions to the fine particle pollution problem.
<P> &quot;Since 1988, AQMD has monitored development of the fuel cell as a key technology.  Based on significant progress by Ballard, we have provided $1 million to support development of this full-scale, fuel cell powered transit bus.&quot;
<P> While visiting Southern California, Ballard brought the bus to the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority, AQMD headquarters, the Riverside County Administrative Center and the American Public Transit Association show in Anaheim.
<P> Ballard has opened a facility in San Diego County to assemble the fuel cell buses.  So far, the firm is building three for Chicago and three for Vancouver.
<P> Ballard hopes to sell additional buses, especially here in Southern California.
<P> &quot;The fuel cell engine that we have developed for this bus represents a clean, non-polluting option for mass transit vehicles,&quot; said Firoz Rasul, president of Ballard.  He said the technology has the potential to significantly reduce air pollution caused by mass transit vehicles.

<P><a name = "study"><h3><B>Volunteer Committee Designs Harbor Dust Monitoring Study</B></h3>
<P>A community action committee is working with AQMD staff to design a dust pollution monitoring and analysis program in the port area.
<P>The monitoring program will address concerns raised by residents at a recent public meeting about airborne pollutants from coal and coke piles in the Los Angeles Harbor.
<P>The study will provide targeted sampling in the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles.  At an AQMD-sponsored meeting earlier this fall, the District and community representatives decided that sampling will be conducted between May and June 1997 -- a time when meteorological conditions are best for particulate sampling.
<P>Coke stripped from giant cokers used by area refineries to process gasoline and coal mined in the Midwest come through the Los Angeles and Long Beach ports for export to Pacific Rim countries.  The coke arrives by truck and the coal by train.
<P>AQMD has completed 19 special particulate monitoring projects in the last eight years in the port area either to investigate community complaints or determine compliance with air quality regulations.  This represents 50% of all special particulate monitoring conducted by AQMD in Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino and Riverside counties combined.  In addition to the new AQMD particulate study, U.S. Customs has contracted for three background particulate monitoring tests, the results of which will be shared with the committee.
<P>The goal of the committee is to recommend which sources to test, where to place sampling equipment, how to inventory sources and rank areas of contribution, and, finally, to recommend the most appropriate and effective action to abate dust based on the data collected.  A secondary goal is to bring the information back to the community through a series of public outreach actions.
<P>Committee members include Olivia Fernandez, Wilmington resident and member of AQMD's Ethnic Community Advisory Council; Gertrude Schwab, president Wilmington North Neighborhood Association and a former Los Angeles Harbor commissioner; John Barbieri, director of the Committee to Cover LAXT; John Wilks, U.S. Customs; Paul Breul, Long Beach Marina Boatowners Association; and Al Garnier, Metropolitan Stevedores.

<TITLE>EPA Proposes New Standards</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>

<IMG SRC="/icon/logo.gif" HEIGHT=75 WIDTH=53 ALIGN="LEFT" HSPACE="8">
<br><center><h2>EPA Proposes New Air Pollution Standards</h2></center><p><hr>


<P> New standards for air pollution based upon recent medical evidence were proposed by the federal EPA on Nov. 27 as required by a federal court order won by the American Lung Association.<P>
(<A HREF="http://134.67.104.12/naaqspro/index.htm">Click here</A> to see details of EPA's proposal)

<P> A review of the latest epidemiological studies by EPA showed that the current standards for ozone and fine particulate may not prevent some significant health effects.  The federal Clean Air Act requires EPA to periodically review and revise the national ambient air quality standards to ensure that in light of the latest scientific knowledge they fully protect human health.
<P> EPA estimated that meeting the proposed standards nationally would eliminate each year some 20,000 premature deaths, 250,000 cases of aggravated asthma, 250,000 cases of acute childhood respiratory problems, 60,000 cases of bronchitis, 9,000 hospital admissions and 1.5 million cases of significant breathing problems.  In addition, EPA said the proposed standards would eliminate $1 billion a year in crop damage.
<P> &quot;In an area like ours where particulate and ozone pollution are so bad, it's particularly important to know where we need to go to fully protect public health and for the public to know when the air is unhealthful.,&quot; said James M. Lents, AQMD executive officer.
<P><B>Proposal To Avert 1,000 Deaths in LA County</B>
<P> EPA proposed to revise the standard for ozone from .12 parts per million averaged over one hour to .08 ppm averaged over eight hours.  Under a complicated formula, an area would be considered to meet the standard if the average of its third highest annual reading at any monitoring station over three years was no greater than .08 ppm.
<P> EPA also proposed new standards for particulate matter that is 2.5 microns in diameter (PM2.5) or smaller.  These standards are 15 micrograms per cubic meter averaged annually and 50 micrograms per cubic meter averaged over 24 hours.  To determine if an area meets the annual and 24-hour standards, EPA again proposed a complicated formula using a spatial (geographic) average and a three-year average of the 98th percentile reading.  EPA said it will retain the existing standards for PM10.
<P> EPA said that without the new standard in Los Angeles County, PM2.5 could continue to cause up to 1,000 premature deaths a year after the PM10 standard is met in the year 2006.
<P> &quot;EPA has based its proposal on a thorough review of the best science available,&quot; said Carol Browner, administrator of the agency.  &quot;We are now hoping to hear from a wide range of the American people.&quot;
<P> Public comments will be taken on the proposal for 60 days.  Final standards are due by June 28 under the court order.
<P><B>More NOx Control Seen as Key</B>
<P> A preliminary AQMD analysis shows the region would exceed the proposed annual average limit for PM2.5 by some 35% and the ozone standard by about 25% after fully carrying out the recently adopted <A HREF="/news/aqmp.html">1997 Air Quality Management Plan</A>.
<P> To meet the new standards, Lents said, the region will have to identify and implement additional measures to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions, primarily from mobile sources which will constitute 83% of total NOx emissions when the present clean air plan is fully carried out.
<P> In addition, Lents said, AQMD will have to significantly increase its air monitoring program to accurately measure PM2.5.  &quot;We will be working with EPA on the monitoring requirements,&quot; he said.
<P> AQMD plans to send comments on the proposal to EPA after the board reviews them.  Once the standards are promulgated next summer, AQMD will convene a technical conference of environmental scientists and planners to identify the attendant air quality planning issues.
<P> EPA is contemplating giving the region until 2002 to develop a plan to meet the new standards and until 2009 to actually meet them, with a two-year extension to 2011 possible.
<P><B>More Time Said Needed</B>
<P> Lents, however, said that the region probably will need more time than that to meet the new standards.
<P> &quot;We've been reducing pollution about 3% to 5% a year,&quot; Lents said.  &quot;If we can keep up this pace, we'll need several more years to meet the standards.  We will be working with EPA regarding attainment deadlines as it develops its implementation policy in the coming months.&quot;
<P> EPA said the revised ozone standard would help protect people against a broad range of medical effects observed at ozone levels that persist over several hours below the current .12 ppm limit.  These include decreased lung function in children who are active outdoors, increased respiratory symptoms in sensitive individuals, and an increase in hospital and emergency room admissions among those with pre-existing respiratory diseases such as asthma.  In addition, EPA said it was concerned that the current standard does not adequately protect against long-term lung damage.
<P> The new PM2.5 standard, EPA said, is needed to protect against increased mortality from fine particulate.  PM2.5 particles are much more likely to absorb and carry into the body potentially toxic materials, such as metals, acids and organic compounds, according to EPA.

<h3><B>INTRODUCTION</B></h3>
<P>Air quality in Southern California continues to improve, with 1995 registering some of the lowest levels in decades.  Yet Southern California still experiences the worst air quality in the nation requiring continued diligence to meet air quality standards.  Continuing the progress toward clean air is a challenging task, not only to recognize and understand complex interactions between emissions and resulting air quality, but also to pursue the best possible set of strategies to improve air quality while maintaining a healthy economy.  This Draft 1997 Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP or Plan) is based on the 1994 AQMP, and carries forward most of the innovative strategies crafted in that Plan.  The current Draft AQMP places a greater focus on particulate matter (PM<font size=-2>10</font>), since this is the first plan required by federal law to demonstrate attainment of the federal PM<font size=-2>10</font> ambient air quality standards.  The Draft Plan also updates the demonstration of attainment for ozone and carbon monoxide, and includes a maintenance plan for nitrogen dioxide (NO<font size=-2>2</font>), as the South Coast Air Basin (Basin) now qualifies for attainment of that federal standard.
<P>The 1997 Draft AQMP proposes policies and measures to achieve federal and state standards for healthful air quality in the Basin and those portions of the Mojave Desert and Salton Sea Air Basins (formerly named the Southeast Desert Air Basin) that are under South Coast Air Quality Management District (District) jurisdiction (namely, Antelope Valley and Coachella Valley).  The Coachella Valley PM<font size=-2>10</font> Plan is being prepared as a separate document, however, as that area is now the first PM<font size=-2>10</font> serious nonattainment area to qualify for redesignation to attainment of the federal PM<font size=-2>10</font> standards.
<P>This draft revision to the Plan also addresses several state and federal planning requirements and incorporates significant new scientific data, primarily in the form of updated emissions inventories, ambient measurements, and new models.  This Draft Plan is consistent with the approaches taken in the 1994 AQMP for the attainment of the federal ozone air quality standard, and shows that with refinements to the 1994 AQMP control strategy, sufficient emission reductions are achieved to meet all federal criteria pollutant standards within the time frames allowed under the federal Clean Air Act.
<P>Some notable regulatory actions have occurred since the 1994 AQMP, all of which have been accounted for in this Draft Plan.  These include new or amended rules which have been adopted since the release of the 1994 AQMP; the implementation of Phase II reformulated fuels (California Cleaner Burning Gasoline) in 1996;  the replacement of the Regulation XV rideshare program with an equivalent emission reduction program under Rule 2202; and new incentive programs for generating emission credits.  In keeping up with advancing computerized communications, the District has established a home page on the Internet (http://www.aqmd.gov) where key information can be browsed and downloaded.  For the first time, this Draft Plan is being made available via the Internet.  In the future, the District plans to expand its services by offering electronic permit application processing.

<h3><B>WHY IS THIS PLAN BEING PREPARED?</B></h3>
<P>The 1990 Clean Air Act (CAA) established deadlines for PM<font size=-2>10</font> SIP submittals.  In February, 1993, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) reclassified the South Coast Air Basin and Coachella Valley as &quot;serious&quot; nonattainment areas for PM<font size=-2>10</font>.  The CAA specified that four years from that reclassification date, a PM<font size=-2>10</font> SIP must be submitted to U.S. EPA, and that submittal must demonstrate attainment of both the 24-hour and annual average PM<font size=-2>10</font> ambient air quality standards by 2006 -- the latest date allowed under the act.  This Plan is being prepared to meet that submittal deadline.  
<P>In addition, under state law, a comprehensive AQMP must also be prepared every three years, the next being due in 1997.  Because there are key linkages between two criteria pollutants -- ozone and PM<font size=-2>10</font> -- this Draft AQMP integrates the technical and policy issues of both pollutants.  The 1997 Draft AQMP therefore satisfies both state and federal requirements for plan submittals.
<A ID="E9E3" NAME="E9E3"></A>
<h3><B>WHAT IS NEW IN THIS DRAFT PLAN REVISION?</B></h3>
<P>Each revision of the AQMP represents a snapshot in time, based on best available information.  The 1997 Draft AQMP generally is very similar to the structure of the 1994 Plan but like all new editions includes significant enhancements.  Key new elements are: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>&#149; Use of the most current air quality information (1995), including special particulate matter data from the PM<font size=-2>10</font> Technical Enhancement Program (PTEP);
<P>&#149; Improved emissions inventories; especially for motor vehicles, fugitive dust, and ammonia sources;
<P>&#149; A similar, but fine-tuned overall control strategy with continuing emphasis on flexible, alternative approaches including intercredit trading;
<P>&#149; A determination that certain control measures contained in the 1994 AQMP, are infeasible, most notably the future indirect source measures;
<P>&#149; Enhanced modeling for particulates;
<P>&#149; Separate analyses for the desert portions within the District's jurisdiction: the Coachella Valley within the Salton Sea Air Basin; and the Antelope Valley within the Mojave Desert Air Basin.  (Note: these desert areas were formerly referred to as the Southeast Desert Air Basin);
<P>&#149; Amendments to the federal Post-1996 Rate-of-Progress Plan and the Federal Attainment Plans for ozone and carbon monoxide; 
<P>&#149; A Maintenance Plan for nitrogen dioxide; and
<P>&#149; An attainment demonstration and State Implementation Plan Revision for PM<font size=-2>10</font>.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<A ID="E9E4" NAME="E9E4"></A>
<h3><B>HOW WAS THIS DRAFT PLAN REVISION PREPARED?</B></h3>
<P>This Draft AQMP Revision was developed based on input and participation of numerous individuals and groups since the adoption of the 1994 AQMP.  In particular, as part of its actions on the 1994 Plan, the District Governing Board formed a PM<font size=-2>10</font> Task Force to &quot;oversee the expeditious development of a PM<font size=-2>10</font> Attainment Plan consistent with requirements established in state and federal law.&quot;  That Task Force, with a membership of 56 individuals representing business, industry, government, academia, and environmental groups, has convened at least once a month since its inception in June 1995.
<P>To help provide important technical and scientific data to support the development of the PM<font size=-2>10</font> Plan, the Governing Board in December 1994 established the PM<font size=-2>10</font> Technical Enhancement Program (PTEP), a cooperative study designed to provide new ambient data for particulates, improved emissions inventories, and improved models to predict future levels of particulates.  That program, jointly funded by the District, U.S. EPA, City of Los Angeles, Western States Petroleum Association, Southern California Gas Company, CalMat, and Southern California Rock Products Association, successfully delivered critical new information which was directly input to this Draft Plan.
<P>The District and the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) sponsored several other plan-related task forces and working groups.  In addition, public comments were received in response to public workshops and consultation meetings held in January 1996 (control measures), May 1996 (modeling), and June 1996 (emissions inventories).
<P>In preparing this Draft Plan, the District coordinated closely with both SCAG, The Southern California Economic Partnership (The Partnership) and the California Air Resources Board (ARB), as well as the U.S. EPA.  SCAG has the primary responsibility for providing future growth projections and the development of transportation control measures; The Partnership has the responsibility for the coordination of market based Advanced Transportation Technology (ATT) implementation strategies and market growth indicators; ARB has the primary responsibility for the development of mobile source emissions inventories as well as mobile source and consumer product control measures.  Their inputs are included in this Draft Plan.  Also, the U.S. EPA provided information on the status of the control efforts for federally regulated sources, and has initiated a public consultation process to further that effort.
<A ID="E9E5" NAME="E9E5"></A>
<h3><B>IS AIR QUALITY IMPROVING?</B></h3>
<P>Yes.  Air quality levels continue to show improvement.  In 1995, for example, ozone levels peaked at 0.26 parts per million -- the lowest such level since the District was established.  There were only 14 Stage I ozone episodes, also the lowest number since the episode program was initiated by the ARB in the 1970s.  Nitrogen dioxide met the federal standards for the third year in a row, thereby qualifying the Basin for redesignation to attainment for that pollutant.  (A maintenance plan for nitrogen dioxide is included in this Draft Plan to satisfy one of the federal requirements needed for redesignation to attainment.)  Annual average PM<font size=-2>10</font> levels are nearly 25 percent lower than a decade ago at the highest PM<font size=-2>10</font> site in Rubidoux.
<P>In 1995, the federal air quality standard for ozone was exceeded at one or more locations in the Basin on 98 days.  While this is the lowest number of days since recordkeeping began, it still is more frequent than any other area of the nation.   Federal 24-hour standards for PM<font size=-2>10</font> were exceeded on 7 percent of the days sampled, while carbon monoxide exceeded federal standards on only 4 percent of the days.  Figure ES-1 shows the 1995 air quality in the South Coast Air Basin as a percentage of the air quality standard.
<A ID="E9E6" NAME="E9E6"></A>
<h3><B>WHAT ARE THE APPLICABLE KEY FEDERAL AND STATE REQUIREMENTS </B><B>THAT THIS DRAFT PLAN REVISION ADDRESSES?</B></h3>
<A ID="E10E1" NAME="E10E1"></A>
<h3><B>Federal</B></h3>
<P>In November 1990, Congress enacted a series of amendments to the Clean Air Act intended to intensify air pollution control efforts across the nation.  One of the primary goals of the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act (CAA) was an overhaul of the planning provisions for those areas not currently meeting National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).  The CAA identifies specific emission reduction goals, requires both a demonstration of reasonable further progress and attainment, and incorporates more stringent sanctions for failure to attain or to meet interim milestones. 
<P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>
<CENTER><B>FIGURE ES-1</B><BR>
<P><STRONG>1995 Air Quality in the South Coast Air Basin</STRONG></CENTER>
<P>The CAA requires the District to develop: (1) a Federal Attainment Plan for PM<font size=-2>10</font> as required by Section 189(b)(2), and (2) a post-1996 Rate-of-Progress Plan as required in Section 182(c)(2)(B).  In addition, any revisions to previous demonstrations of attainment must be resubmitted to U.S. EPA.  For the Draft Plan, this includes the ozone and carbon monoxide demonstrations for the Basin, and ozone demonstrations for the Los Angeles county portion of the Mojave Desert Air Basin (Antelope Valley), and for the Riverside nonattainment area of the Salton Sea Air Basin (Coachella - San Jacinto Planning Area).
<A ID="E10E2" NAME="E10E2"></A>
<h3><B>State</B></h3>
<P>The California Clean Air Act (CCAA) was signed into law on September 30, 1988.  Through its many requirements, the CCAA serves as an important consideration in the Basin's attainment planning efforts.
<P>Key CCAA requirements that the District must address in the 1997 AQMP are to: apply Best Available Retrofit Control Technology; reduce nonattainment pollutants and their precursors at a rate of five percent per year, or, if this cannot be done, include all feasible measures and an expeditious implementation schedule; ensure no net increase in mobile source emissions after 1997; reduce population exposure to severe nonattainment pollutants (i.e., ozone, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen dioxide for the Basin) according to a prescribed schedule; and, rank control measures by cost-effectiveness and implementation priority.  Additionally, state law requires market-based programs proposed as part of the  attainment strategy to meet specific design requirements. State law also specifies a requirement to achieve an average vehicle ridership during peak commute hours of 1.5 persons per vehicle by 1999 or, the equivalent in emission reductions.  However, as a result of recent legislation (SB 772, chaptered in 1995), the District is now prohibited from enforcing rules requiring employee trip reduction plans.  The District is pursuing equivalent emissions reductions with Rule 2202, adopted in 1995, and through the efforts of the REACH (Reduce Emissions And Congestion on Highways) Task Force, which has developed several approaches for further analysis. Finally, state law requires the plan to provide for attainment of the federal and state ambient air quality standards at the earliest practicable date (Health &amp; Safety Code Section 40462).
<A ID="E9E7" NAME="E9E7"></A>
<h3><B>HOW HAS THE EMISSIONS INVENTORY CHANGED?</B></h3>
<P>For this Draft Plan Revision, a 1993 emissions inventory is relied upon to establish baseline and future year projections.  The inventories were developed according to procedures stemming from the Federal Clean Air Act.  To meet state and federal law requirements, updated 1987 and 1990 emissions inventories are also provided.  
<P>The 1993 emissions inventory now represents the most comprehensive emissions inventory ever established for the South Coast Air Basin.  Key area source emissions were revised for solvent usage categories, fugitive dust, and ammonia sources.  On-road mobile sources are estimated with the latest approved emissions factors supplied by the ARB using EMFAC7G.  An updated marine vessels inventory was prepared as part of this plan development.
<P>Using the 1993 emissions inventory, future emission forecasts are also developed.  These forecasts reflect demographic and economic growth forecasts by SCAG.  In addition, emission reductions resulting from ARB and District regulations adopted by December 1995 are included in the forecasts.
<A ID="E9E8" NAME="E9E8"></A>
<h3><B>HAS THE OVERALL CONTROL STRATEGY CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY?</B></h3>
<P>No.  The basic control strategy remains essentially the same as that adopted in the 1994 AQMP.  However, there are some refinements proposed with this revision.  At the time of adoption of the 1994 Plan, two aspects of the AQMP were considered: (1) the control measures needed to meet federal CAA requirements for the attainment of the ozone standards (referred to as &quot;1994 CA-SIP measures&quot;), and (2) additional control measures needed to meet the federal PM<font size=-2>10</font> standards (referred to as &quot;1994 AQMP measures.&quot;)  Because there was no federal requirement at that time to demonstrate PM<font size=-2>10</font> attainment in the 1994 Plan (although it is a federal requirement for the 1997 Plan), those additional measures over and above the 1994 CA-SIP measures were not submitted to U.S. EPA as a revision to the State Implementation Plan.
<P>With  a few exceptions, it has now been determined that the basic strategy contained within the 1994 CA-SIP measures are sufficient to demonstrate attainment of both the ozone and PM<font size=-2>10</font> federal standards.  The notable changes to the control strategy include:  (1) removal of the future indirect source measures (ISRs); (2) less reliance on Transportation Control Measures (TCMs) and on long-term future technologies as allowed under Section 182(e)(5) of the CAA; and (3) removal of some otherwise infeasible control measures<I>.</I>
<A ID="E9E9" NAME="E9E9"></A>
<h3><B>WHAT CONDITIONS HAVE CHANGED TO REFLECT ATTAINMENT OF BOTH OZONE AND PM</B><B><font size=-2>10</font></B><B> </B><B>STANDARDS?</B></h3>
<P>Since the adoption of the 1994 Plan, the District has embarked on a cooperative study to gain new information on particulates.  Described earlier, the PTEP study has provided the District with a wealth of important information which has significantly improved the ability to predict future levels of PM<font size=-2>10</font>.  In particular, these studies have shown that: (1) fugitive dust emissions are considerably lower (e.g., less than half) of the previous estimates; (2) ammonia emissions from dairy farms in the Chino area, which play a key role in the formation of ammonium nitrate PM<font size=-2>10</font>, are about one-fourth as high as previously estimated; (3) ambient levels of PM<font size=-2>10</font> in the Basin are now approximately 20 percent lower than those used in the 1994 AQMP (new 1995 data versus previously used 1986 data);  and (4) new modeling tools are able to simulate future year particulate levels more reliably than in the past.
<P>With the new data and tools, it can now be determined that fewer additional reductions in emissions are needed to meet the federal ambient air quality standards by the statutory deadline of 2006, and that there is greater confidence than in the past on these results. 
<P>For ozone, based on discussions with ARB and following the recommendations from the U.S. EPA and ARB modeling guidelines, of the five modeling episodes, the June 1985 meteorological episode was dropped from the 1997 AQMP analysis.  The 1985 episode is the oldest episode used for modeling and represented extreme meteorological conditions.  Federal air quality standards allow for the exclusion of the highest measured ozone day by allowing on average one exceedance each year or three exceedances over three years without causing a violation of the ozone air quality standard.
<A ID="E9E10" NAME="E9E10"></A>
<h3><B>WHAT OTHER REQUIREMENTS ARE ADDRESSED IN THIS DRAFT PLAN?</B></h3>
<P>The 1990 Federal Clean Air Act Amendments require the development of near-term and long-term transportation control measures (TCMs) as well as contingency measures.  The federal Clean Air Act requires that both &quot;near-term&quot; and &quot;long-term&quot; TCMs be developed for the Basin.  Near-term measures must be implemented before the year 2000, and are primarily defined as transportation improvements as contained in the Regional Mobility Element (RME) as provided by SCAG.  Long-term measures are to be implemented post 2000, and are included in the Advanced Transportation Technology Incentive Measures.
<P>Under federal conformity regulations, all federal or federally funded projects must conform to the SIP, and must not be a cause of impeding progress toward attainment of the federal standards.  To establish conformity, emissions from future projects must be accounted for in the future baseline emissions inventories, such that the attainment demonstrations include these future emissions.  For transportation projects, planning is now underway out to the year 2020.  To establish conformity for those outyear projects, the Draft Plan also includes an ozone &quot;maintenance&quot;  analysis to the year 2020.  The  analysis demonstrates that continued reductions in emissions due to such factors as continuing fleet turnovers to low and zero emitting vehicles will counteract growth-related emissions increases, such that attainment of the standard is maintained from 2010 to 2020.
<A ID="E9E11" NAME="E9E11"></A>
<h3><B>WHAT HAPPENED TO THE FEDERAL IMPLEMENTATION PLAN?</B></h3>
<P>In 1995, the U.S. EPA Administrator signed the draft Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) for the South Coast, Ventura, and Sacramento regions.  The FIP was prepared under court order in response to legal challenges to an earlier AQMP.
<P>Subsequent to the 1994 AQMP, the U.S. Congress rescinded the California FIP.  However, in proposing approval of the CA-SIP measures as contained in the 1994 AQMP, the U.S. EPA established a consultative process to evaluate the assignment of emission reductions to federal transportation sources.  That consultative process would be completed in 1997.  In the event that the expected emission reductions from federal sources are not realized, then a revised ozone attainment demonstration would be developed by the end of 1997.
<A ID="E9E12" NAME="E9E12"></A>
<h3><B>WHAT CONSIDERATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE FOR POSSIBLE NEW FEDERAL STANDARDS FOR PARTICULATE </B><B>MATTER AND OZONE?</B></h3>
<P>In light of new epidemiological and other health data, the U.S. EPA is currently reevaluating the federal standards for particulate matter and ozone.  At this time it is highly probable that new standards will be promulgated in 1997.  For ozone, it is likely that the current 1-hour standard will be replaced by an 8-hour standard.  For particulate matter, it is likely that a new fine particulate standard (PM<SUB>2.5</SUB>) will be established for both a short-term (24-hour) and long-term (annual) averaging period.  It is also probable that a form of the current PM<font size=-2>10</font> standards will be retained.
<P>This Draft Plan does not have to address these possible future standards.  Forthcoming U.S. EPA policies will establish the timelines, as required under the CAA, to meet any new standards.  However, the District is cognizant of these developments, and, as part of the air quality modeling, is providing comparative information regarding the current attainment strategies relative to the potential new standards.  Generally, this assessment shows that the new standards, if promulgated, will be more restrictive than the current standards.
<A ID="E9E13" NAME="E9E13"></A>
<h3><B>HAS THE ATTAINMENT PROJECTION CHANGED FOR FEDERAL OR STATE </B><B>STANDARDS?</B></h3>
<P>No.  The 1997 Draft AQMP proposes to attain the state and federal standards in the same time frame as proposed in the 1994 AQMP.  (See Figure ES-2.)

</H3>

<P>
Air quality in Southern California continues to improve, with
1995 registering some of the lowest levels in decades. Yet Southern
California still experiences the worst air quality in the nation
requiring continued diligence to meet air quality standards. Continuing
the progress toward clean air is a challenging task, not only
to recognize and understand complex interactions between emissions
and resulting air quality, but also to pursue the best possible
set of strategies to improve air quality while maintaining a healthy
economy. This 1997 Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP or Plan)
is based on the 1994 AQMP, and carries forward most of the innovative
strategies crafted in that Plan. The current AQMP places a greater
focus on particulate matter (PM10), since this is the first plan
required by federal law to demonstrate attainment of the federal
PM10 ambient air quality standards. The Plan also updates the
demonstration of attainment for ozone and carbon monoxide, and
includes a maintenance plan for nitrogen dioxide (NO2), as the
South Coast Air Basin (Basin) now qualifies for attainment of
that federal standard.
<P>
The 1997 AQMP proposes policies and measures to achieve federal
and state standards for healthful air quality in the Basin and
those portions of the Mojave Desert and Salton Sea Air Basins
(formerly named the Southeast Desert Air Basin) that are under
South Coast Air Quality Management District (District) jurisdiction
(namely, Antelope Valley and Coachella Valley). The Antelope Valley
will remain under the District's jurisdiction until June 30, 1997.
The Coachella Valley PM10 Plan is being prepared as a separate
document, however, as that area is now the first PM10 serious
nonattainment area to qualify for redesignation to attainment
of the federal PM10 standards.
<P>
This revision to the Plan also addresses several state and federal
planning requirements and incorporates significant new scientific
data, primarily in the form of updated emissions inventories,
ambient measurements, and new models. This Plan is consistent
with the approaches taken in the 1994 AQMP for the attainment
of the federal ozone air quality standard, and shows that with
refinements to the 1994 AQMP control strategy, sufficient emission
reductions are achieved to meet all federal criteria pollutant
standards within the time frames allowed under the federal Clean
Air Act.
<P>
Some notable regulatory actions have occurred since the 1994 AQMP,
all of which have been accounted for in this Plan. These include
new or amended rules which have been adopted since the release
of the 1994 AQMP; the implementation of Phase II reformulated
fuels (California Cleaner Burning Gasoline) in 1996; the replacement
of the Regulation XV rideshare program with an equivalent emission
reduction program under Rule 2202; and new incentive programs
for generating emission credits. In keeping up with advancing
computerized communications, the District has established a home
page on the Internet (http://www.aqmd.gov) where key information
can be browsed and downloaded. For the first time, this Plan is
being made available via the Internet. In the future, the District
plans to expand its services by offering electronic permit application
processing.
<H3><a name = "exec2">WHY
IS THIS PLAN BEING PREPARED?</H3>

<P>
The 1990 Clean Air Act (CAA) established deadlines for PM10 SIP
submittals. In February, 1993, the U. S. Environmental Protection
Agency (U.S. EPA) reclassified the South Coast Air Basin and Coachella
Valley as &quot;serious&quot; nonattainment areas for PM10. The
CAA specified that four years from that reclassification date,
a PM10 SIP must be submitted to U.S. EPA, and that submittal must
demonstrate attainment of both the 24-hour and annual average
PM10 ambient air quality standards by 2006 -- the latest date
allowed under the act. This Plan is being prepared to meet that
submittal deadline.
<P>
In addition, under state law, a comprehensive AQMP must also be
prepared every three years, the next being due in 1997. Because
there are key linkages between two criteria pollutants -- ozone
and PM10 -- this AQMP integrates the technical and policy issues
of both pollutants. The 1997 AQMP therefore satisfies both state
and federal requirements for plan submittals.
<H3><A NAME="exec3">WHAT
IS NEW IN THIS PLAN REVISION?</H3>

<P>
Each revision of the AQMP represents a snapshot in time, based
on best available information. The 1997 AQMP generally is very
similar to the structure of the 1994 Plan but like all new editions
includes significant enhancements. Key new elements are:
<UL>
<LI>Use of the most current air quality information (1995), including
special particulate matter data from the PM10 Technical Enhancement
Program (PTEP);
<LI>Improved emissions inventories; especially for motor vehicles,
fugitive dust, and ammonia sources;
<LI>A similar, but fine-tuned overall control strategy with continuing
emphasis on flexible, alternative approaches including intercredit
trading;
<LI>A determination that certain control measures contained in
the 1994 AQMP, are infeasible, most notably the future indirect
source measures;
<LI>Enhanced modeling for particulates;
<LI>Separate analyses for the desert portions within the District's
jurisdiction: the Coachella Valley within the Salton Sea Air Basin;
and the Antelope Valley within the Mojave Desert Air Basin. (Note:
these desert areas were formerly referred to as the Southeast
Desert Air Basin);
<LI>Amendments to the federal Post-1996 Rate-of-Progress Plan
and the Federal Attainment Plans for ozone and carbon monoxide;
<LI>A Maintenance Plan for nitrogen dioxide; and
<LI>An attainment demonstration and State Implementation Plan
Revision for PM10.
</UL>

<H3><a name = "exec4">HOW
WAS THIS PLAN REVISION PREPARED?</H3>

<P>
This AQMP Revision was developed based on input and participation
of numerous individuals and groups since the adoption of the 1994
AQMP. In particular, as part of its actions on the 1994 Plan,
the District Governing Board formed a PM10 Task Force to &quot;oversee
the expeditious development of a PM10 Attainment Plan consistent
with requirements established in state and federal law.&quot;
That Task Force, with a membership of 56 individuals representing
business, industry, government, academia, and environmental groups,
has convened at least once a month since its inception in June
1995.
<P>
To help provide important technical and scientific data to support
the development of the PM10 Plan, the Governing Board in December
1994 established the PM10 Technical Enhancement Program (PTEP),
a cooperative study designed to provide new ambient data for particulates,
improved emissions inventories, and improved models to predict
future levels of particulates. That program, jointly funded by
the District, U.S. EPA, City of Los Angeles, County Sanitation
Districts of Los Angeles, Western States Petroleum Association,
Southern California Gas Company, CalMat, and Southern California
Rock Products Association, successfully delivered critical new
information which was directly input to this Plan.
<P>
The District and the Southern California Association of Governments
(SCAG) sponsored several other plan-related task forces and working
groups. In addition, public comments were received in response
to public workshops and consultation meetings held in January
1996 (control measures), May 1996 (modeling), and June 1996 (emissions
inventories). Regional public workshops were conducted in September
1996 and regional public hearings are being held in October 1996
to seek inputs on the draft AQMP.
<P>
In preparing this Plan, the District coordinated closely with
both SCAG, The Southern California Economic Partnership (The Partnership)
and the California Air Resources Board (ARB), as well as the U.S.
EPA. SCAG has the primary responsibility for providing future
growth projections and the development of transportation control
measures; The Partnership has the responsibility for the coordination
of market based Advanced Transportation Technology (ATT) implementation
strategies and market growth indicators; ARB has the primary responsibility
for the development of mobile source emissions inventories as
well as mobile source and consumer product control measures. Their
inputs are included in this Plan. Also, the U.S. EPA provided
information on the status of the control efforts for federally
regulated sources, and has initiated a public consultation process
to further that effort.
<H3><a name = "exec5">IS
AIR QUALITY IMPROVING?</H3>

<P>
Yes. Air quality levels continue to show improvement. In 1995,
for example, ozone levels peaked at 0.26 parts per million --
the lowest such level since the District was established. There
were only 14 Stage I ozone episodes, also the lowest number since
the episode program was initiated by the ARB in the 1970s. Nitrogen
dioxide met the federal standards for the third year in a row,
thereby qualifying the Basin for redesignation to attainment for
that pollutant. (A maintenance plan for nitrogen dioxide is included
in this Plan to satisfy one of the federal requirements needed
for redesignation to attainment.) Annual average PM10 levels are
nearly 25 percent lower than a decade ago at the highest PM10
site in the Metropolitan Riverside County Area.
<P>
In 1995, the federal air quality standard for ozone was exceeded
at one or more locations in the Basin on 98 days. While this is
the lowest number of days since recordkeeping began, it still
is more frequent than any other area of the nation. Federal 24-hour
standards for PM10 were exceeded on 7 percent of the days sampled,
while carbon monoxide exceeded federal standards on only 4 percent
of the days. Figure ES-1 shows the 1995 maximum air pollutant
concentrations in the South Coast Air Basin as a percentage of
air quality standards.
<H3><a name = "exec6">WHAT
ARE THE APPLICABLE KEY FEDERAL AND STATE REQUIREMENTS THAT THIS
PLAN REVISION ADDRESSES?</H3>

<b>Federal
</b>

<P>
In November 1990, Congress enacted a series of amendments to the
Clean Air Act intended to intensify air pollution control efforts
across the nation. One of the primary goals of the 1990 amendments
to the Clean Air Act (CAA) was an overhaul of the planning provisions
for those areas not currently meeting National Ambient Air Quality
Standards (NAAQS). The CAA identifies specific emission reduction
goals, requires both a demonstration of reasonable further progress
and attainment, and incorporates more stringent sanctions for
failure to attain or to meet interim milestones.
<P>
<B>FIGURE ES-1</B> 
<P>
1995 Maximum Pollutant Concentrations in the South Coast Air Basin
<P>
The CAA requires the District to develop: (1) a Federal Attainment
Plan for PM10 as required by Section 189(b)(2), and (2) a post-1996
Rate-of-Progress Plan as required in Section 182(c)(2)(B). In
addition, any revisions to previous demonstrations of attainment
must be resubmitted to U.S. EPA. For the Plan, this includes the
ozone and carbon monoxide demonstrations for the Basin, and ozone
demonstrations for the Los Angeles county portion of the Mojave
Desert Air Basin (Antelope Valley), and for the Riverside nonattainment
area of the Salton Sea Air Basin (Coachella - San Jacinto Planning
Area).
<H3>State
</H3>

<P>
The California Clean Air Act (CCAA) was signed into law on September
30, 1988. Through its many requirements, the CCAA serves as an
important consideration in the Basin's attainment planning efforts.
<P>
Key CCAA requirements that the District must address in the 1997
AQMP are to: apply Best Available Retrofit Control Technology;
reduce nonattainment pollutants and their precursors at a rate
of five percent per year, or, if this cannot be done, include
all feasible measures and an expeditious implementation schedule;
reduce population exposure to severe nonattainment pollutants
(i.e., ozone, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen dioxide for the Basin)
according to a prescribed schedule; and, rank control measures
by cost-effectiveness and implementation priority. Additionally,
state law requires market-based programs proposed as part of the
attainment strategy to meet specific design requirements. As a
result of recent legislation (SB 772, chaptered in 1995), the
District is now prohibited from enforcing rules requiring employee
trip reduction plans. However, the District is pursuing equivalent
emissions reductions with Rule 2202, adopted in 1995, and through
the efforts of the REACH (Reduce Emissions And Congestion on Highways)
Task Force, which has developed several approaches for further
analysis. Finally, state law requires the plan to provide for
attainment of the federal and state ambient air quality standards
at the earliest practicable date (Health &amp; Safety Code Section
40462).
<H3><A NAME="exec7">HOW
HAS THE EMISSIONS INVENTORY CHANGED?</H3>

<P>
For this Plan Revision, a 1993 emissions inventory is relied upon
to establish baseline and future year projections. The inventories
were developed according to procedures stemming from the Federal
Clean Air Act. To meet state and federal law requirements, updated
1987 and 1990 emissions inventories are also provided.
<P>
The 1993 emissions inventory now represents the most comprehensive
emissions inventory ever established for the South Coast Air Basin.
Key area source emissions were revised for solvent usage categories,
fugitive dust, and ammonia sources. On-road mobile sources are
estimated with the latest approved emissions factors supplied
by the ARB using EMFAC7G. An updated marine vessels inventory
was prepared as part of this plan development.
<P>
Using the 1993 emissions inventory, future emission forecasts
are also developed. These forecasts reflect demographic and economic
growth forecasts by SCAG. In addition, emission reductions resulting
from ARB and District regulations adopted by September 1996 are
included in the forecasts.
<H3><A NAME="exec8">HAS
THE OVERALL CONTROL STRATEGY CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY?</H3>

<P>
No. The basic control strategy remains essentially the same as
that adopted in the 1994 AQMP. However, there are some refinements
proposed with this revision. At the time of adoption of the 1994
Plan, two aspects of the AQMP were considered: (1) the control
measures needed to meet federal CAA requirements for the attainment
of the ozone standards (referred to as &quot;1994 CA-SIP measures&quot;),
and (2) additional control measures needed to meet the federal
PM10 standards (referred to as &quot;1994 AQMP measures.&quot;)
Because there was no federal requirement at that time to demonstrate
PM10 attainment in the 1994 Plan (although it is a federal requirement
for the 1997 Plan), those additional measures over and above the
1994 CA-SIP measures were not submitted to U.S. EPA as a revision
to the State Implementation Plan.
<P>
With a few exceptions, it has now been determined that the basic
strategy contained within the 1994 CA-SIP measures are sufficient
to demonstrate attainment of both the ozone and PM10 federal standards.
The notable changes to the control strategy include: (1) removal
of the future indirect source measures (ISRs); (2) less reliance
on Transportation Control Measures (TCMs) and on long-term future
technologies as allowed under Section 182(e)(5) of the CAA; and
(3) removal of some otherwise infeasible control measures<I>.</I>

<H3><A NAME="exec9"></A>WHAT
CONDITIONS HAVE CHANGED TO REFLECT ATTAINMENT OF BOTH OZONE AND
PM10 STANDARDS?</H3>

<P>
Since the adoption of the 1994 Plan, the District has embarked
on a cooperative study to gain new information on particulates.
Described earlier, the PTEP study has provided the District with
a wealth of important information which has significantly improved
the ability to predict future levels of PM10. In particular, these
studies have shown that: (1) fugitive dust emissions are considerably
lower (e.g., less than half) of the previous estimates; (2) ammonia
emissions from dairy farms in the Chino area, which play a key
role in the formation of ammonium nitrate PM10, are about one-fourth
as high as previously estimated; (3) ambient levels of PM10 in
the Basin are now approximately 20 percent lower than those used
in the 1994 AQMP (new 1995 data versus previously used 1986 data);
and (4) new modeling tools are able to simulate future year particulate
levels more reliably than in the past.
<P>
With the new data and tools, it can now be determined that fewer
additional reductions in emissions are needed to meet the federal
ambient air quality standards by the statutory deadline of 2006,
and that there is greater confidence than in the past on these
results.
<P>
For ozone, based on discussions with ARB and following the recommendations
from the U.S. EPA and ARB modeling guidelines, of the five modeling
episodes, the June 1985 meteorological episode was dropped from
the 1997 AQMP analysis. The 1985 episode is the oldest episode
used for modeling and represented extreme meteorological conditions.
Federal air quality standards allow for the exclusion of the highest
measured ozone day by allowing on average one exceedance each
year or three exceedances over three years without causing a violation
of the ozone air quality standard.
<H3><A NAME="exec10">WHAT
OTHER REQUIREMENTS ARE ADDRESSED IN THIS PLAN?</H3>

<P>
The 1990 Federal Clean Air Act Amendments require the development
of near-term and long-term transportation control measures (TCMs)
as well as contingency measures. The federal Clean Air Act requires
that both &quot;near-term&quot; and &quot;long-term&quot; TCMs
be developed for the Basin. Near-term measures must be implemented
before the year 2000, and are primarily defined as transportation
improvements as contained in the Regional Mobility Element (RME)
as provided by SCAG. Long-term measures are to be implemented
post 2000, and are included in the Advanced Transportation Technology
Incentive Measures.
<P>
Under federal conformity regulations, all federal or federally
funded projects must conform to the SIP, and must not be a cause
of impeding progress toward attainment of the federal standards.
To establish conformity, emissions from future projects must be
accounted for in the future baseline emissions inventories, such
that the attainment demonstrations include these future emissions.
For transportation projects, planning is now underway out to the
year 2020. To establish conformity for those outyear projects,
the 2010 emissions budget provided in this Plan serves as the
emissions budget beyond 2010. For information purposes only, the
Plan also includes an analysis for the year 2020. The analysis
indicates that continued reductions in emissions due to such factors
as continuing fleet turnovers to low and zero emitting vehicles
will counteract growth-related emissions increases, such that
attainment of the standard is maintained from 2010 to 2020.
<H3><A NAME="exec11">WHAT
HAPPENED TO THE FEDERAL IMPLEMENTATION PLAN?</H3>

<P>
In 1995, the U.S. EPA Administrator signed the Federal Implementation
Plan (FIP) for the South Coast, Ventura, and Sacramento regions.
The FIP was prepared under court order in response to legal challenges
to an earlier AQMP.
<P>
Subsequent to the 1994 AQMP, the U.S. Congress rescinded the California
FIP. However, in approving the CA-SIP measures and the local measures
contained in the 1994 AQMP, the U.S. EPA established a consultative
process to evaluate the assignment of emission reductions to federal
transportation sources. That consultative process would be completed
in 1997. In the event that the expected emission reductions from
federal sources are not realized, then a revised ozone attainment
demonstration would be developed by the end of 1997.
<H3><A NAME="exec12">WHAT
CONSIDERATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE FOR POSSIBLE NEW FEDERAL STANDARDS
FOR PARTICULATE MATTER AND OZONE?</H3>

<P>
In light of new epidemiological and other health data, the U.S.
EPA is currently reevaluating the federal standards for particulate
matter and ozone. At this time it is highly probable that new
standards will be promulgated in 1997. For ozone, it is likely
that the current 1-hour standard will be replaced by an 8-hour
standard. For particulate matter, it is likely that a new fine
particulate standard (PM2.5) will be established for both a short-term
(24-hour) and long-term (annual) averaging period. It is also
probable that a form of the current PM10 standards will be retained.
<P>
This Plan does not have to address these possible future standards.
Forthcoming U.S. EPA policies will establish the timelines, as
required under the CAA, to meet any new standards. However, the
District is cognizant of these developments, and, as part of the
air quality modeling, is providing comparative information regarding
the current attainment strategies relative to the potential new
standards. Generally, this assessment shows that the new standards,
if promulgated, will be more restrictive than the current standards.
<H3><A NAME="exec13">HAS
THE ATTAINMENT PROJECTION CHANGED FOR FEDERAL OR STATE STANDARDS?
</H3>

<P>
No. The 1997 AQMP proposes to attain the state and federal standards
in the same time frame as proposed in the 1994 AQMP. (See Figure
ES-2.)

<p><a name = "relationship"><H3><B>RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SHORT-TERM USES AND LONG-TERM PRODUCTIVITY</B></H3>
<P>An important consideration when analyzing the effects of a proposed project is whether it will result in short-term environmental benefits to the detriment of achieving long-term or maximizing productivity of these resources.  Implementing the 1997 AQMP is not expected to achieve short-term goals at the expense of long-term environmental productivity or goal achievement.  The purpose of the 1997 revision of the AQMP is to set forth a comprehensive control program that will lead the area into compliance with all federal and state air quality standards.  By attaining federal and state air quality standards, the AQMP is expected to enhance long-term environmental productivity in the region.
<P>Implementing the 1997 AQMP does not narrow the range of beneficial uses of the environment or pose long-term risks to health or safety.  Of the potential environmental impacts discussed in Chapter 4, only those related to air quality, water quality, energy, hazards and solid/hazardous waste are considered potentially significant.  Implementation of the recommended mitigation measures will ensure such impacts are mitigated to the greatest degree feasible.  
<P>Because no short term environmental benefits are gained at the expense of long term environmental goals being achieved, there is no justification for delaying the proposed action.  This project must be implemented now as the District is required by the Federal and California Clean Air Acts to formally review the AQMP and adopt relevant plan revisions which will achieve the state and federal ambient air quality standards by the established deadline.  The District is proceeding with the 1997 AQMP pursuant to this mandate.
<A ID="E9E6" NAME="E9E6"></A>
<P><a name = "significant"><H3><B>SIGNIFICANT IRREVERSIBLE ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES</B></H3>
<P>CEQA requires an EIR to discuss significant irreversible environmental changes which would result from a proposed action should it be implemented.  Irreversible changes include a large commitment of nonrenewable resources, committing future generations to specific uses of the environment (e.g., converting undeveloped land to urban uses), or enduring environmental damage due to an accident.  
<P>Implementation of the 1997 AQMP is not anticipated to result in any significant irreversible adverse environmental changes.  The AQMP would place only an incremental demand on nonrenewable and limited resources, such as energy and water supplies, relative to the accelerated rate of use of these resources due to population growth and increased consumer demand.  The largely irretrievable conversion of undeveloped/agricultural land to urban uses is a function of the growing population and local land use authority, not the 1997 AQMP.  Finally, the project does not have the capacity to result in enduring environmental damage due to accidents.
<P>Conversely, positive environmental changes are expected to result from implementation of the 1997 AQMP.  The project will result in significantly reduced emissions of air pollutants, thereby greatly improving public health.  Emissions reductions will also directly improve the vitality of crops and other plants.  The health of livestock, domestic animals, and other wildlife will be indirectly enhanced by the positive effects on plant life (as well as by any direct benefits attributable to less air pollution).  The damage to buildings and other structures which results from air pollution will be diminished.
<A ID="E9E7" NAME="E9E7"></A>
<p><a name = "growth"><H3><B>GROWTH-INDUCING IMPACTS</B></H3></a>
<P>Growth-inducing impacts can generally be characterized in three ways.  In the first instance, a project is located in an isolated area and brings with it sufficient urban infrastructure to result in development pressure being placed on the intervening and surrounding land.  This type of induced growth leads to conversion of adjacent acreage to higher intensity uses because the adjacent land becomes more conducive to development and, therefore, more valuable because of the availability of the extended infrastructure.
<P>A second type of growth-inducing impact is produced when a large project, relative to the surrounding community or area, affects the surrounding community by facilitating and indirectly promoting further community growth.  The additional growth is not necessarily adjacent to the site or of the same land use type as the project itself.  A project of sufficient magnitude can initiate a growth cycle in the community that could alter a community's size and character significantly.
<P>A third and more subtle type of growth-inducing impact occurs when a new type of development is allowed in an area, which then subsequently establishes a precedent for additional development of a similar character.
<P>None of the above scenarios characterize the project in question.  The control measures contained in the AQMP accommodate the projected growth for the region - they are not the cause of residential, commercial, industrial, and infrastructure development.  The AQMP may indirectly increase the efficiency of the region's urban form through encouraging more air quality efficient development patterns.  The AQMP does not, however, change jurisdictional authority or responsibility concerning land use or property issues.  Land use authority falls solely under the purview of the local governments.  The District is specifically excluded from infringing on existing city or county land use authority (California Health &amp; Safety Code &#167; 40414).
<P>It should be noted that a secondary yet positive growth-inducing impact could result from implementation of the AQMP.  As air quality improves, the area will become a more attractive, healthful place to live which may encourage additional migration to the region.  SCAG&#146;s Regional Comprehensive Plan and Guide (RCP&amp;G) notes, however, that &quot;whereas in the past, migration played a dominant role in population increase, births will constitute the major portion of future growth.&quot;  According to the RCP&amp;G EIR, the general plans of local jurisdictions within the region considered the impact of the population growth to be insignificant.  The RCP&amp;G population, land use and transportation projections are used to develop the AQMP.  It is unlikely, therefore, that any secondary effects to population due to the implementation of the AQMP will be significant.
<A ID="E9E8" NAME="E9E8"></A>
<p><a name = "effects"><H3><B>EFFECTS FOUND NOT TO BE SIGNIFICANT</B></H3>
<P>The environmental topics below were analyzed to determine if the proposed project would create significant impacts in any of these areas.  For all the environmental topics discussed below, no significant direct or indirect impacts were identified.
<A ID="E17E1" NAME="E17E1"></A>
<P><B>Land Use and Planning</B>
<P>Land use authority falls solely under the purview of the local governments and the District is specifically excluded from infringing on existing city or county land use authority (California Health &amp; Safety Code &#167; 40414).  Land use authority is a component of local planning. The AQMP does not call for any changes in the locally adopted general plans.  
<P>Potential impacts to dairies as a result of implementing control measure WST-05 were also evaluated in the Initial Study prepared for the 1997 AQMP Draft EIR and not found to be significant.  The issue evaluated was whether or not WST-05 would cause Agricultural and dairy operations in the Chino Agricultural Preserve to relocate out of the Basin, thus, resulting in the conversion of the Preserve to urban uses.  Conversion of the Chino Agricultural Preserve, however, is not part of the 1997 AQMP.  Conversion of the Chino Agricultural Preserve would be expected to occur as a result of population and land use pressure to convert open properties to developable land, which could be used for housing, commercial, industrial, etc., development. Any shift in land use designations, such as the conversion of the Chino Agricultural Preserve, would be expected to undergo its own separate CEQA analysis, prepared by the Lead Agency and reviewed by the District as a commenting agency.  Any new industrial or commercial operations replacing the agricultural land would be subject to all applicable District rules and regulations in addition to compliance with federal Best Available Control Technology (BACT) requirements.  Further, as required by CEQA, the lead agency would have to demonstrate consistency with the AQMP.  The AQMP will, therefore, not significantly adversely affect land use.
<A ID="E17E2" NAME="E17E2"></A>
<P><B>Population and Housing</B>
<P>California Health and Safety Code &#167; 40460(b) stipulates that SCAG, with the assistance of counties and cities, is responsible for preparing and approving the portions of the AQMP related to regional demographic projections on which emission of pollutants are based.  The 1997 AQMP is based on the population projections developed by SCAG and included in the RCP&amp;G.  According to the RCP&amp;G, population projections in the 4 county region should increase by approximately 7 million people by 2015.  The RCP&amp;G EIR deemed that increase to be insignificant.  For the purpose of this analysis, population would be impacted significantly if implementation of the 1997 AQMP would result in a population growth that is not consistent with the policies of the general plans of local jurisdictions.  Any impact implementation of the 1997 AQMP might have on the projected distribution of population growth is expected to be consistent with the general plans of local jurisdictions within the region.  This impact is therefore considered insignificant.
<P>There are no additional housing demands anticipated from implementation of the 1997 AQMP nor are there any measures that would affect existing housing for the same reasons cited above.
<A ID="E17E3" NAME="E17E3"></A>
<P><B>Geophysical Problems</B>
<P>The 1994 AQMP EIR evaluated potential geophysical impacts due to the reduction of surface permeability to precipitation, causing excessive runoff and possible erosion of downstream soils.  These impacts were anticipated as a result of PM10 measures which included paving or chemically stabilizing unpaved roads, parking lots, staging areas, and construction areas.  After analysis it was determined that the potential impacts from these activities were insignificant.  There are no new measures proposed in the 1997 AQMP with the potential to impact surface permeability beyond those which were previously analyzed and found to be insignificant.
<A ID="E17E4" NAME="E17E4"></A>
<P><B>Transportation/Circulation</B>
<P>The proposed revisions to the AQMP are not expected to generate any additional vehicle trips or result in changes to existing transit systems or transportation corridors.  Existing transit systems in the district will not be diminished, eliminated or affected in any way as a result of the 1997 AQMP.  Implementation of any transportation control measure that reduces vehicle miles traveled or vehicle trips would be expected to increase the efficiency of traffic flow in the region.  The proposed revisions to the AQMP reflect SCAG&#146;s RTP and RCP&amp;G. The proposed revisions to the AQMP, which include the RTP, will not result in any significant adverse impacts on transportation/circulation.
<A ID="E17E5" NAME="E17E5"></A>
<P><B>Biological Resources</B>
<P>The 1997 AQMP is not anticipated to cause any widespread adverse change that would negatively alter the overall character or distribution of plant life in the district.  The primary cause of adverse impacts to plant life in the district is population growth leading to new development and air pollution.  Implementation of the AQMP is not anticipated to result in additional new construction sites, nor will it affect population growth and the distribution of population growth.  In general, the widespread reduction in air contaminants due to implementation of the 1997 AQMP will benefit plant communities.
<P>The proposed revision to the AQMP includes PM10 control measures that would require paving or chemical stabilization of unpaved roads, parking lots, and construction areas.  An analysis of the potential impacts of these measures on plant life indicates that: 1) all areas to be treated are generally devoid of plant life;  2) the AQMP does not specify the use of any one PM10 treatment method, but rather would endorse the use of environmentally-benign dust control methods; and 3) any significant surface runoff (containing chemical stabilizer residue) would require mitigation control for capturing the runoff.  In addition, any chemical stabilizer used must be non-toxic, meet any specifications, criteria and tests required by any federal, state, or local water agency, and must not interfere with protection afforded to species by the federal Endangered Species Act.  These requirements are included in current District fugitive dust rules (403 and 403.1) and the District is committed to maintaining such requirements when these measures are implemented.  For these reasons, any impacts to plant life as a result of implementing these control measures are considered insignificant.
<P>It should be noted that some dust control techniques, including vegetative ground covers and tree-based windbreaks using endemic plant species, may help establish or re-establish plant life in areas disturbed by human activities.
<P>Additionally, the 1997 AQMP is not expected to adversely affect animal species or animal populations for the same reasons cited above.  As in humans, positive health affects in animals would occur from the reduction of air contaminants.  Indirect benefits would occur because of the ecological interrelationship between animals and their environment.  Improvement in plant life as a result of reducing the destructive effects of pollution on plants will also benefit animal life.
<A ID="E17E6" NAME="E17E6"></A>
<P><B>Energy and Mineral Resources</B>
<P>Energy has been identified in the 1997 AQMP as being potentially impacted by the proposed project:  The reader is referred to Chapter 4 for a discussion of potential impacts.
<P>Mineral resources are, however, not expected to be adversely impacted by the 1997 AQMP.  SCAG&#146;s RCP&amp;G has identified urbanization as the most significant impact to mineral resources in the region.  No significant impacts to mineral resources were identified as a result of the 1997 AQMP, since no control measures are resource intensive, and the AQMP does not impact land use and planning and urban development as identified above.
<A ID="E17E7" NAME="E17E7"></A>
<P><B>Noise</B>
<P>As noted in the Initial Study consideration was given to potential noise impacts from construction activities and add-on pollution control equipment which may result from implementation of control measures of the 1997 AQMP.  Construction activities arising from the AQMP would consist mainly of the installation of add-on equipment and would involve the use of heavy duty equipment (bulldozers, etc.) and fugitive dust controls.  The anticipated add-on equipment would not significantly increase the noise levels of individual pieces of equipment.  Fugitive dust is typically controlled by non-noise intensive methods such as spraying active work sites with water or other types of dust suppressants.  In addition, pollution control at commercial or industrial facilities does not add appreciably to the noise environment already existing at such facilities. Local noise ordinances and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) worker safety regulations are expected to ensure that potential noise impacts are not significant.  For these reasons, potential noise impacts from implementing the 1997 AQMP were determined to be insignificant.  This conclusion is consistent with the conclusion regarding noise impacts in the EIR for the 1994 AQMP.
<P>Specific noise impacts depend greatly on the nearby receptors as well as the type of equipment or activity involved.  Such specific determination cannot be made at this point.  If necessary, these impacts may be further addressed during the rule development process for each individual control measure.
<A ID="E17E8" NAME="E17E8"></A>
<P><B>Public Services</B>
<P>Since established permitting programs and procedures to handle hazardous situations, such as flammability of acetone in reformulated coatings, are in place, the impact on fire departments will not be significant.  Also, current high solvent coatings are formulated with toxics, which tend to be more flammable than waterbased or low-VOC coatings, no anticipated change is expected from the current existing coating flammability situation.
<P>No significant impacts to public services are anticipated as a result of implementation of the 1997 AQMP.  The 1994 AQMP analyzed potential impacts resulting from market incentives and add-on control technologies.  Implementation of the 1994 AQMP was not expected to require substantially greater public services resources than would be necessary to accommodate increasing population growth.  The market incentive programs proposed in the plan, plus the possibility of allowing local governments the flexibility of choosing from a menu of compliance options, was determined to reduce the possibility of significant long-term adverse impacts on public service agencies.  No further impacts to public services are anticipated as a result of implementation of the 1997 AQMP.
<A ID="E17E9" NAME="E17E9"></A>
<P><B>Aesthetics/Recreation</B>
<P>There are no adverse aesthetic impacts associated with the 1997 AQMP. There is very little construction associated with the 1997 AQMP; none of which would obstruct any scenic vista or view or create an aesthetically offensive site open to public view. The control measures for unpaved roads target paving of high use roadways (e.g., greater than 150 trips per day) within urban areas.  The Forest Service roads would most likely have fewer than 150 trips per day and/or are located within rural areas.  Future District regulations may require reduced speed limits for such roads, but paving is not anticipated.  There are no measures that would require the Forest Service to alter their existing setting in an aesthetically unpleasant manner.
<P>The 1997 AQMP does not include measures which affect existing or future recreational opportunities in the region.  Further, the proposed 1997 AQMP is not expected to result in significant adverse alterations of present or planned land uses which could affect recreation.
<P>The 1997 AQMP will not result in the closure of any unsurfaced forest roads or other roads leading to recreational activities nor will it adversely affect any aspect of recreation in the district.  The District would prefer to work with the Forest Service towards the prevention of off-highway vehicle use in non-designated areas.  This goal is consistent with the goals of the Forest Service, and, consequently is not considered to be an impact of the 1997 AQMP.
<P>No significant light and glare impacts are anticipated since the 1997 AQMP is not expected to create additional demand for lighting or reflective materials beyond existing conditions.  Implementing the 1997 AQMP will not require exposed combustion, additional night lighting or reflective equipment or devices.
<A ID="E17E10" NAME="E17E10"></A>
<P><B>Cultural Resources</B>
<P>The 1997 AQMP does not include any measures that would result in any adverse impacts to cultural resources in the District.  There are several existing laws currently in place that are designed to protect and mitigate potential adverse impacts to cultural resources.  As with any construction activity, should archaeological resources be found during construction of a project to comply with the AQMP, such construction activity will be ceased until the appropriate agency is contacted and a thorough archaeological assessment is made.

<A ID="E9E1" NAME="E9E1"></A><p>
<a name = "intro"><H3><B>INTRODUCTION</B></H3>
<P>The California Legislature adopted the Lewis Air Quality Act in 1976, creating the South Coast Air Quality Management District (District) from a voluntary association of air pollution control districts in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, and San Bernardino counties.  The new agency was charged with developing uniform plans and programs for the South Coast Air Basin (Basin) to attain federal air quality standards by the dates specified in federal law.  The agency was also required to meet state standards by the earliest date achievable through the use of reasonably available control measures.  
<P>The Lewis Air Quality Act (now known as the Lewis-Presley Air Quality Management Act) requires the District to prepare an air quality management plan (AQMP) consistent with federal planning requirements.  In 1977, amendments to the federal Clean Air Act (CAA) included requirements for submitting State Implementation Plans (SIPs) for nonattainment areas that fail to meet all federal ambient air quality standards.  SIPs include all control measures and schedules for compliance that are necessary to meet CAA mandates by designated time tables.  The first AQMP was prepared and approved by the District in 1979.  The AQMP was then revised in 1982 to reflect better data and improved modeling tools.  In 1987, a federal court ordered the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to disapprove the 1982 AQMP Revision because it did not demonstrate attainment of all National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) by 1987 as required by the CAA.  This, in part, led to the preparation of the 1989 AQMP.  The 1989 AQMP was adopted on March 17, 1989.  The 1989 AQMP was specifically designed to attain all federal ambient air quality standards.  Its preparation, however, began prior to the adoption of the California Clean Air Act (CCAA) and, therefore, did not fully address specific state requirements outlined therein.  The 1991 revision to the AQMP, developed to comply with the CCAA, was adopted by the District Governing Board at its July 1991 public hearing.
<P>The AQMD Governing Board adopted the 1994 AQMP at its August 1994 public hearing.  The District is now preparing the 1997 AQMP to comply with the CCAA three-year update requirement.  Like the 1994 AQMP, the 1997 AQMP will be designed to comply with requirements specified in the CCAA and the federal CAA.
<P>A description of federal and state requirements is included in the main volume of the AQMP.
<A ID="E9E2" NAME="E9E2"></A>
<p><a name = "ceqa"><H3><B>CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT</B></H3>
<P>The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), Public Resources Code Section 21000 et seq., requires that the potential environmental impacts of proposed projects be evaluated and that feasible methods to reduce or avoid identified significant adverse environmental impacts of these projects be identified.
<P>To fulfill the purpose and intent of CEQA, the District has prepared this Environmental Impact Report (EIR) to address the potential environmental impacts associated with this proposed Plan.  Prior to making a decision on the 1997 AQMP, the District Governing Board must review and certify the EIR as providing adequate information on the potential adverse environmental impacts of the AQMP.
<A ID="E10E1" NAME="E10E1"></A><p>
<B>Notice of Preparation/Initial Study</B>
<P>A Notice of Preparation and Initial Study for the 1997 AQMP EIR (included as Appendix A of this Draft EIR) were distributed to responsible agencies and interested parties for a 30-day review and comment period ending February 29, 1996.  A notice of the availability of these documents was distributed to other agencies and organizations and was also published in newspapers throughout the area of the District&#146;s jurisdiction.
<P>The Initial Study for the 1997 AQMP EIR used an environmental checklist to identify potential impacts of the proposed project.  The environmental checklist used by the District is essentially that contained in Appendix I of the state Guidelines for Implementation of the California Environmental Quality Act (California Administrative Code, Title 14, Chapter 3).  
<P>The Initial Study identified potential adverse impacts in the following environmental topics: air quality; water; hazards, energy; and solid/hazardous wastes.  In some instances it may be necessary for an EIR to include additional environmental topics in the event that adverse impacts are identified after public review of the Initial Study.  Twenty-five comment letters were received on the Initial Study during the 30-day public review period.  The Draft EIR also includes detailed responses to all 25 comments received on the Initial Study (Appendix B).
<A ID="E10E2" NAME="E10E2"></A>
<p><B>Type of EIR</B>
<P>CEQA includes provisions for program EIRs in connection with issuance of rules, regulations, plans, or other general criteria to govern the conduct of a continuing program, including adoptions of broad policy programs, from those prepared for specific types of projects (e.g., land use projects) (CEQA Guidelines Section 15168).  The EIR for the 1997 AQMP is a program EIR because it examines control measures that will ultimately be issued as rules or regulations and the impact the implementation of those measures would have on the environment.
<P>A program EIR allows consideration of broad policy alternatives and program-wide mitigation measures at a time when an agency has greater flexibility to deal with basic problems or cumulative impacts.  A program EIR also plays an important role in establishing a structure within which CEQA reviews of future related actions can be effectively conducted.  This concept of covering broad policies in a program EIR and incorporating the information contained therein by reference into subsequent EIRs for specific projects is known as &quot;tiering&quot; (CEQA Guidelines Section 15385).  A program EIR will provide the basis for future environmental analyses and will allow project-specific EIRs to focus solely on the new effects or detailed environmental issues not previously considered.  If an agency finds that no new effects could occur or no new mitigation measures would be required, the agency can approve the activity as being within the scope of the project covered by the program EIR, and no new environmental document would be required (CEQA Guidelines Section 15168(c)[4]).
<P>The degree of specificity required in an EIR corresponds to the degree of specificity involved in the underlying activity described in the EIR (CEQA Guidelines Section 15146).  Because the level of information regarding potential impacts from control measures recommended in the AQMP is general at this time, the environmental impact forecasts are also general or qualitative in nature.  In certain instances, such as future ambient air quality concentrations, impacts are quantified to the degree feasible.  
<A ID="E10E3" NAME="E10E3"></A>
<p><B>Document Format</B>
<P>State CEQA Guidelines outline the information required in an EIR, but allow the format of the document to vary [CEQA Guidelines Section 15120(a)].  For the reasons discussed below, the format of this Draft EIR differs slightly from the EIRs previously prepared by the District.  The main difference in the format involves the discussion of project alternatives.  
<P>EIRs are required to include a range of reasonable alternatives that meet the basic project objectives and eliminate or reduce significant environmental effects [CEQA Guidelines Section 15126(d)].  The discussion of alternatives is intended to foster informed decision making and informed public participation.
<P>For those EIRs which require the analysis of project alternatives, the District typically includes a chapter on alternatives.  That chapter would include a description of the alternatives, analysis of potential environmental impacts of each alternative, recommended mitigation measures (if necessary), and an evaluation of the comparative merits of each alternative relative to the proposed project.  Alternatives are typically developed by breaking down the proposed project into general components, and then altering the specifics of one or more of those components.  Different compliance approaches that generally achieve the objectives of the project may also be considered as project alternatives.
<P>This Draft EIR for the 1997 AQMP includes the same comprehensive analysis of project alternatives, but approaches the discussion slightly differently.  The alternatives in this EIR were developed to comply with the objectives of the 1997 AQMP; (i.e., to demonstrate attainment of ambient air quality standards while defining policies that minimize the impact on the local economy).  The alternatives are expected to provide the District Governing Board with a range of strategies which meet this two-fold criteria.  
<P>In this Draft EIR, however, the alternatives descriptions immediately follow the description of the proposed project.  Likewise, the analysis of potential environmental impacts of the alternatives for each environmental topic analyzed follows that of the proposed project.  For example, the discussion of the potential adverse impacts on energy of the alternatives is presented after the energy impacts analysis for the proposed project.  Similarly, an analysis of the cumulative impacts for each environmental topic follows the project specific analysis.
<P>The format of this Draft EIR is structured to enhance clarity for the reader.  Combining both the descriptions and impact analyses of the alternatives with those of the proposed project should facilitate the comparison of the relative merits of each.  Presenting the entire analysis of each environmental topic in distinct subsections, including cumulative impacts, is expected to further facilitate the reader's understanding of the analyses contained herein.

<a name = "intro"><H3><B>INTRODUCTION</B></H3>
<P>The overall control strategy in the AQMP provides a path to achieving emission reductions and air quality goals.  Implementation of the 1997 AQMP is based on a series of control measures that vary based on the source type, such as stationary or mobile, as well as the pollutant that is being targeted.  Although great strides have been made in air pollution control technologies, air quality goals in the District&#146;s jurisdiction cannot be achieved without significant further advancements.
<P>The 1991 and 1994 AQMPs provided a strategy for attaining state and federal air quality standards.  That strategy was developed based upon scientific and technical data, legal mandates, and input from public agencies and others.  The District solicited input on the AQMP from the regulated community, environmental and public interest groups, and the public in general.  Input was gathered from comments, meetings and general contact with these groups as well as through a series of public workshops on the AQMP and public review of the AQMPs and their EIRs.
<P>In recent years, there has been a concerted effort by environmental regulators to incorporate greater flexibility into the regulatory process.  As a means of generating further discussion on what is considered to be the most effective and efficient strategy to meet state and federal air quality requirements, the District is considering a range of potential alternatives to the 1997 AQMP strategy.  Depending upon the results of the environmental analysis and input from the public, the District may modify the draft AQMP strategy.
<P>The AQMP strategy currently being implemented includes measures which primarily target stationary and mobile sources.  These measures are based on feasible methods of attaining ambient air quality standards.  That approach continues to form the basis of the short- and intermediate-term control measures proposed in the 1997 AQMP.
<P>This chapter describes the proposed project which includes current air pollution control strategies and details the proposed approach for the 1997 AQMP to attain and maintain state and national ambient air quality standards.  Descriptions of potential alternative approaches for the 1997 AQMP are also included in this chapter.

<p><a name = "location"><H3><B>PROJECT LOCATION</B></H3></a>
<P>The District has jurisdiction over an area of approximately 12,000 square miles, consisting of the four-county South Coast Air Basin (Basin) and the Los Angeles county portion of the Mojave Desert Air Basin (MDAB) (formerly the Southeast Desert Air Basin [SEDAB]) and the Riverside county portions of the Salton Sea Air Basin (SSAB) (formerly part of the SEDAB).  The Basin, which is a subarea of the District&#146;s jurisdiction, is bounded by the Pacific Ocean to the west and the San Gabriel, San Bernardino, and San Jacinto mountains to the north and east.  It includes all of Orange county and the nondesert portions of Los Angeles, Riverside, and San Bernardino counties. The Los Angeles county portion of MDAB (known as North county or Antelope Valley) is bounded by the San Gabriel Mountains to the south and west, the Los Angeles/Kern county border to the north, and the Los Angeles/San Bernardino county border to the east.  The Riverside county portion of the SSAB is bounded by the San Jacinto Mountains in the west and spans eastward up to the Palo Verde Valley.  The federal nonattainment area (known as the Coachella Valley Planning Area) is a subregion of the Riverside county and the SSAB that is bounded by the San Jacinto Mountains to the west and the eastern boundary of the Coachella Valley to the east (Figure 2-1).

<p><a name = "progress"> <H3><B>PROGRESS IN IMPLEMENTING THE 1994 AQMP</B></H3>
<P>Progress in implementing the 1994 AQMP can be measured by the number of control measures that have been adopted as rules and the resulting tons of pollutants targeted for reduction.  Since 1994, seven control measures have been adopted by the District through May 31, 1996.  Table 2-1 lists the AQMP control measures that were adopted through May 31, 1996.
<P>The primary focus of the District&#146;s efforts since the adoption of the 1994 AQMP Plan was in the proposed development of a VOC RECLAIM program.  The VOC RECLAIM control measure (CTS-01) was put on hold by the District Governing Board in October 1995.  Concurrent actions by the Governing Board indicated that the substitution measures, contained in the 1994 AQMP, were to be acted upon as the primary regulatory program.  The District is currently developing regulations to implement the substitution measures.  The measures are discussed in Chapters 4 and 7 of the AQMP.

The Partnership is a non-profit organization with the assigned mission of accelerating the deployment of Advanced Transportation Technologies (ATTs) throughout Southern California.  It was established to provide an effective organization to implement advanced transportation technology directives.  The Partnership, through its public/private participatory structure, is uniquely capable of providing networking and guidance to those parties interested in the deployment of advanced transportation technologies throughout Southern California.  It has in effect become a clearing house of ATT information and progress.
<A ID="E9E4" NAME="E9E4"></A>
<p><a name = "project"><H3><B>PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVES</B></H3>
<P>The 1997 AQMP proposes two tiers of emission reduction measures (short/intermediate and long-term measures), based on availability and readiness of technology.  Short and intermediate-term measures rely on available technologies and management practices between 1997 and the year 2001.  These short- and intermediate-term measures are designed to satisfy the federal Clean Air Act requirement of reasonably available control technologies (RACT), and the CCAA requirements of best available retrofit control technologies (BARCT).
<P>To ultimately achieve ambient air quality standards, further development and refinement of known low and zero-emission control technologies in addition to technological breakthroughs will be necessary.  Long-term measures rely on the advancement of technologies and control methods that can reasonably be expected to occur between 1997 and 2010.
<P>Traditionally, the District has taken a multi-step approach to developing control measures necessary to achieve all ambient air quality standards.  This approach examined the types of controls needed to meet those ambient air quality standards which have more near term attainment dates.  For instance, many of the NO<SUB>x</SUB> control measures are designed to maintain the federal nitrogen dioxide air quality standard and to meet PM10 air quality standards by 2006.  After achieving the necessary NO<SUB>x</SUB> reductions, the best mix of VOC and NO<SUB>x</SUB> emission reduction measures is then determined and proposed to meet the ozone standard bu 2010.
<P>Though both the 1991 AQMP and the 1994 AQMP targeted maximum VOC emission reductions, relying heavily on technological breakthroughs on VOC controls, alternative paths to ozone attainment appear available. Improved data on current emissions and emission control technology indicates that not all VOC emission reductions called for in the 1994 AQMP are necessary to meet the ambient air quality standards.
<P>It should be noted that the control strategy proposed in the 1997 AQMP for reducing emissions in the Basin also achieves attainment of the federal ozone standard in Los Angeles county portion of the MDAB and the Riverside county portions of the SSAB (i.e., Antelope Valley and the Coachella Valley Planning Area, respectively).  These areas are designated severe nonattainment areas for ozone.  There is strong evidence that pollutant transport from the Basin to the Antelope Valley and the CoachellaValley Planning Area is the primary cause of the ozone nonattainment status of those areas.  In an effort to prevent further transport, locally generated emissions in the district will be controlled using measures implemented at both the state and federal level.

<p><B>Short- and Intermediate-term Measures</B>
<P>The 1997 AQMP includes 37 stationary source measures (of which one is a further study measure), 24 mobile source measures (of which five are Advanced Transportation Technologies, three are Further Study measures and one Transportation control measure) eight contingency measures, and sixteen level II contingency measures that require further study.  This subsection provides a summary of those measures.  A detailed description of the control measures are found in Appendeces IV-A and IV-B of the AQMP.
<P>Short- and intermediate-term emission reduction control measures are proposed to be adopted by the year 2000.  These measures primarily rely on the traditional command and control approach facilitated by market incentive programs to implement technological solutions and control methods.
<A ID="E11E1" NAME="E11E1"></A>
<p><B>Stationary Source Control Measures</B>
<P>For inventory purposes, area sources are grouped into over 130 categories.  Stationary source controls (Table 2-2) are proposed to reduce emissions from both point (permitted) sources and area (generally small and non-permitted) sources.  There are approximately 16,000 facilities with permitted stationary equipment within the Basin.
<P>Appendix IV, Section I provides a specific explanation for each of these measures.  In addition, command and control measures for coatings and solvents previously subsumed under the proposed VOC RECLAIM program have now become the primary approach and are updated to reflect the most recent technology assessment and rule implementation schedule.  Three new control measures have been added to the draft 1997 AQMP:  FLX-01 - Intercredit Trading Program; FLX-02 - Air Quality Investment Fund; and MSC-03 - Promotion of Catalyst/Surface Technology Programs.  These measures are designed to provide compliance flexibility and to facilitate the implementation of the command and control measures.  Two control measures that were formerly in the 1994 AQMP as contingency measures (CTY-08 and CTY-09), are combined and included in the 1997 AQMP as a single core measure.

<p>Short- and intermediate-term measures rely on available control technologies.  The control methods for stationary sources identified in Table 2-3 below rely on a variety of control technologies and management practices.  Control technologies vary according to the source type and pollutant being controlled and generally include a process or physical modification such as product reformulation, installation of air pollution control equipment, alternative fuels, etc.  Good management practices include administrative changes such as improved housekeeping techniques, inspection and maintenance programs, etc.

<p><B><I>Coatings and Solvent Control Measures</I></B>
<P>Controls for the coatings and solvents category are primarily targeted at reducing VOC emissions.  The primary control approach for this category is command-and-control regulations with additional compliance options provided by Intercredit Trading and an Air Quality Investment Program (AQIP).  Under an Intercredit Trading Program, regulated sources could apply prescribed control technology, purchase emission credits in an open market in lieu of controls, or participate in the AQIP which would in turn generate equivalent emission reductions.  Control measure CTS 01 - VOC RECLAIM, from the 1994 AQMP is not being included in the 1997 AQMP.  The command-and-control measures previously subsumed under CTS-01  will now be contained in control measure CTS-02 - Control of Emissions from Solvents and Coatings which has been broken out into several subcategories for clarification.  
<P>In addition, the District is proposing to develop a series of public awareness and education programs for small source categories.  The intent of these programs is to develop a partnership between the District and smaller more diverse businesses to educate sources on alternative products, techniques, processes, and equipment modifications that can be used at their facilities to reduce pollution.  Examples of potentially targeted businesses include beauty salons, leather repair shops, and laboratories.
<A ID="E12E2" NAME="E12E2"></A>
<p><B><I>Petroleum Operations, Refueling, and Fugitive VOC Emission Control Measures</I></B>
<P>This category pertains primarily to operations and materials associated with the petroleum and chemical industries.  Within this category there are three control measures targeting fugitive VOC emissions associated with transfer and storage of organic liquids, fugitive wastewater emissions and industrial processes.  Measures FUG-01 and RFL-02 were adopted in 1995 and are now part of the emissions baseline in the draft Plan.
<A ID="E12E3" NAME="E12E3"></A>
<p><B><I>Combustion Source Control Measures</I></B>
<P>There are six control measures in this category, two of which are area source credit programs designed primarily to provide compliance flexibility and to incentivize clean technologies. These include commercial and residential equipment and energy conservation strategies.  There is another measure for new commercial and residential water heaters.  In addition, a proposed rule for petroleum refinery flares is being developed to first assess the emission inventory for this source category; another rule is being developed for the control of PM<SUB>10</SUB> emissions from refinery fluid catalytic coaching units (FCCUs); and lastly, a rule is proposed for NO<SUB>x</SUB> reductions from small boilers and process heaters.
<P>In addition, the results of technology review as required by the District RECLAIM Rule 2015 - Backstop Provisions are incorporated in the draft 1997 AQMP.  The purpose of the technology review is to ensure that the facility allocations are based on control methods that are likely to be technologically feasible.  Furthermore, proposed changes in allocation due to further technology assessment are reflected in the draft Plan to account for potential increases in emissions.
<A ID="E12E4" NAME="E12E4"></A>
<p><B><I>Fugitive Dust and Miscellaneous Source Control Measures</I></B>
<P>This category includes a total of 14 control measures.  Ten measures are designed for a variety of sources ranging from service-oriented industries such as restaurants and agricultural activities, to waste-related emissions such as livestock waste, waste burning, and disposal of VOC-containing materials.  An incentive program is proposed to promote the use of lighter color roofing, road materials, or tree planting.  A second incentive program is proposed to promote catalyst surface coating technologies for air conditioning units.  An in-use compliance program is also considered to ensure the performance of air pollution control equipment.  A measure regarding emissions charges for stationary sources as required under federal law is proposed for further study to determine its applicability and feasibility.
<A ID="E12E5" NAME="E12E5"></A>
<p><B><I>Statewide Consumer Product and Pesticide Program Control Measures</I></B>
<P>This category contains one measure that will be implemented by ARB to further reduce emissions from consumer products and another by the Department of Pesticide Regulation (DPR) to control pesticide emissions.  Both measures were originally contained in the 1994 Ozone SIP.
<A ID="E12E6" NAME="E12E6"></A>
<p><B><I>Ozone Depleting Compound Control Measures</I></B>
<P>As a result of worldwide concern over the destruction of the stratospheric ozone layer, the Montreal Protocol has established a schedule to eliminate the use of certain stratospheric ozone depleting compounds (ODCs).  Additional concern on the national and local level has led to the accelerated phase out of ODCs.
<P>ODCs such as 1,1,1-trichloroethane and CFC-113 are currently used in cleaning, precision cleaning, electronics, coatings, adhesives, aerosols, and flexible slabstock foam manufacturing.  As part of the adoption of the Federal Reactive Organic Compounds Rate-of-Progress Plan, the District Governing Board directed staff to consider the impacts on the urban ozone problem from the replacement of ODCs with VOC-containing materials.
<P>In 1992, an ODC Working Group comprised of representatives from the District, ARB, EPA, industry, and other interested parties was established to evaluate the impact of a potential VOC increase resulting from elimination of ODCs.  The ODC Working Group developed substitution estimates based on categories of usage and types of processes.  In January 1996, the District prepared an &quot;Ozone Depleting Compounds Replacement Guidelines&quot; to facilitate the transition from ODCs to substances that are the most environmentally benign.  Based on the estimates provided in the guideline document, an additional 11 tons per day of VOC emissions are projected by the year 2010 as compared to the baseline projections discussed in Chapter 3 of the AQMP.  An adjustment has been made in the emissions inventory to account for these future year emission increases.

<p><B>Mobile Source Control Measures</B>
<A ID="E12E7" NAME="E12E7"></A>
<p><B><I>On-Road Mobile Source Control Measures</I></B>
<P>On-road motor vehicles, which include passenger cars, light-duty trucks, medium-duty vehicles, heavy-duty vehicles, and motorcycles, currently number approximately 10 million in the Basin.  In 1995, these vehicles traveled more than 300 million miles per day, and by the year 2010, vehicle miles traveled are projected to exceed 400 million miles per day.  ARB and U.S. EPA have primary authority to control mobile source emissions through the adoption of emission standards and other related requirements, whereas the District has more limited authority to reduce emissions from this source.
<P>The 1997 AQMP includes on-road mobile source control measures to be implemented by the District, ARB or the U.S. EPA (Table 2-4).  Two on-road control measures to be implemented by the District are new to the 1997 AQMP, and are voluntary, market-based measures, while the remaining control measures represent measures from the 1994 California Ozone SIP.

<p><B><I>Technology-Based On-Road Control Measures</I></B>
<P>In the past, the control of on-road vehicle emissions was achieved primarily from the adoption of more stringent emission standards.  The most significant action that has taken place in pursuing this approach was the adoption of the Low-Emission Vehicle and Clean Fuels rulemaking by ARB in September 1990.  This rulemaking established stringent tailpipe standards and mandated low-emission vehicle sales for the years 1994 through 2003.  This regulation is applicable for passenger cars, light-duty trucks, and medium-duty vehicles, and its principal requirements are summarized as follows:
<P><ul><li>establishes vehicle emission standards that will require additional VOC and NO<SUB>x</SUB> emission reductions of approximately 80 percent and 50 percent, respectively, compared to 1994 emission standards;
<P><li> requires the sale of zero-emission vehicles beginning in year 2003;  
<P><li>allows the use of vehicles powered by alternative fuels; and 
<P><li>requires the widespread availability of alternative fuels, based on the number of alternative-fueled vehicles produced by automobile manufacturers.</ul>
<P>The 1997 AQMP. consistent with the 1994 California Ozone SIP, includes a control measure that proposes ARB adoption of emission standards that are more stringent than existing low-emission vehicle requirements, to continue the progress in reducing passenger car and light-duty truck emissions for the post-2003 time frame.  The control measure is based on the development of cost-effective gasoline engine control technology, along with anticipated advancements in electric vehicle battery technology and supporting infrastructure.  It is proposed that the current 1998 to 2002 requirements for medium-duty vehicles be modified by ARB to accelerate the in-use penetration of low-emission vehicles and ultra-low emission vehicles.  Again, this proposal is based on assumptions regarding expected advancements in light-duty vehicle emission control technology that would be applicable for the medium-duty vehicle sector.  
<P>The approach for further reducing emissions from heavy-duty vehicles depends on whether the vehicles are powered with gasoline or diesel fuel.  ARB proposes to obtain NOx and VOC emission reductions for gasoline-fueled heavy-duty vehicles by lowering emission standards through the utilization of three-way catalytic converters.  Catalytic converter technology is already well established for light-duty vehicles.  ARB is proposing a combination of strategies to maximize the utilization of very low NOx emitting engines in California&#146;s heavy-duty diesel trucking fleets.  These strategies include ARB&#146;s adoption of more stringent NOx emission standards, effective for the post 2002 time frame, as well as U.S. EPA adoption of correspondingly stringent nationwide NOx emission standards for the post 2004 time frame.  U.S. EPA action in this area is particularly important because a significant amount of diesel-fueled heavy-duty vehicles operating in California are powered with federally certified engines.

<p><B><I>Market-Based/Incentive Strategy Control Measures</U></I></B>
<P>The 1994 AQMP included a number of market-based control measures that have now been adopted into rules.  These include MON-01 - Emissions Reduction Credit for Low-Emission Retrofit Fleet Vehicles, MON-05 - Emissions Reduction Credit for Heavy-Duty Buses, and MON-06 - Emissions Reduction Credit for Heavy-Duty Trucks.  In continuing this approach to reduce mobile source emissions, the 1997 AQMP includes several market-based/incentive control measures targeting the light- and heavy-duty vehicle sectors.  It is anticipated that some of the market-based incentive measures such as truck stop electrification and the use of fuel additives will produce emission reductions in excess of existing or planned requirements.
<P>The 1997 AQMP also includes market-based/incentive control measures, control measure M1, for ARB implementation.  Specifically, it is proposed that ARB adopt regulations implementing an accelerated retirement program for light-duty vehicles beginning in 1999, with a smaller pilot scale program to be implemented in the 1996 to 1998 time frame.  The oldest, highest emitting vehicles would be targeted for this program.  It is also proposed that a similar strategy be implemented for heavy-duty diesel trucks, targeting the accelerated retirement using the same implementation dates as the light-duty vehicle accelerated retirement program.  Finally, a market incentive rule, to be implemented by ARB or the District, is proposed with the objective of accelerating the penetration of low-NOx heavy-duty engines in local trucking fleets.  This would occur in the 1996 to 2002 time frame, prior to the implementation of revised NOx emission standards for heavy-duty engines.
<A ID="E12E12" NAME="E12E12"></A>
<p><B><I>Off-Road Mobile Source Control Measures</I></B><
<P>Off-road mobile sources refer to off-road vehicles and mobile non-vehicular equipment categories such as aircraft, trains, marine vessels, farm and construction equipment, industrial equipment (e.g., forklifts), and utility equipment (e.g., lawn mowers).  The authority to develop and implement regulations for off-road mobile sources lies primarily with the U.S. EPA, ARB, and to a lesser extent with the District.
<P>The 1997 AQMP includes off-road mobile source control measures designed for U.S. EPA, ARB and District implementation.  The District control measure is new to the AQMP and is a voluntary market-based measure.  The remaining control measures represent revisions from the 1994 AQMP and target mandatory emission limits for certain types of off-road equipment categories.  Table 2-4 provides a list of the off-road mobile source measures.
<P>Because of practical and legal considerations, the majority of control measures for off-road mobile sources focus on the U.S. EPA adoption of nationwide emission standards.  Control measures proposing emission standards for new aircraft engines, as well as new and rebuilt locomotive engines, target U.S. EPA implementation, since U.S. EPA has authority over these emission sources.  U.S. EPA implementation is also necessary for control measures that propose more stringent emission standards for diesel powered off-road industrial equipment, and gas and LPG powered industrial equipment from 25 to 175 horsepower. [  It should be noted that industrial equipment can include emission sources that are categorized under farm and construction equipment below 175 horsepower.  Since U.S. EPA has sole authority for farm and construction equipment below 175 horsepower, separate control measures targeting industrial equipment have been included based on whether implementation would be assigned to ARB or U.S. EPA.]   A control measure proposing nationwide emission standards implemented by U.S. EPA, in conjunction with international standards, is also the most viable approach for reducing marine vessel emissions since many of these vessels are not based in California or the United States.  Finally, nationwide emission standards for pleasure craft are being proposed since manufacturers would have a larger market base to promote the development of emission control technology.  As a backstop strategy, ARB would act to adopt state emission standards (where legally permitted) for off-road emission sources, if U.S. EPA fails to adopt nationwide standards.
<P><A ID="I2" NAME="I2"></A><A ID="I3" NAME="I3"></A>The District&#146;s new market-based control measure proposes the issuance of mobile source emission reduction credits for programs that accelerate the replacement of existing pleasure craft engines with new lower-polluting engines.  Should U.S. EPA or ARB adopt new standards for pleasure craft, any credits issued by the District would have to be for actions in excess of those standards.  These programs would be voluntarily implemented and would provide industry with more flexible and potentially more cost-effective approaches in complying with other District emission reduction requirements.
<A ID="E12E13" NAME="E12E13"></A>
<p><B><I>Transportation Control Measures</I></B>
<P>One transportation control measure (TCM), five advanced transportation technology (ATT) measures and three further study strategies (FSS) have been included in the 1997 AQMP.
<P>The Reduce Emissions and Congestion on Highways (REACH) Task Force was convened after the completion of the 1994 AQMP.  The goals of the REACH Task Force are to develop pricing strategies or market incentive programs which would:  reduce congestion and improve mobility; effectively reduce emissions and encourage the development of advanced transportation technologies.  The REACH Task Force continues to meet to develop potential control approaches.

<p><B>Long-Term Emission Reduction Measures</B>
<P>Previous AQMPs showed that achievement of ambient air quality standards will require additional emissions reductions beyond the implementation of short- and intermediate-term control measures.  Historically, the AQMP has emphasized and relied upon the continual need to deploy advanced air pollution control technologies and cleaner fuels to ultimately achieve air quality goals.  In the 1994 AQMP, emissions reduction targets were established for the remaining emissions after implementation of short- and intermediate-term controls.  These targets, referred to as long-term or Section 182(e)(5) control measures, were based on the application of advanced technologies and additional market incentives and operational measures.  The draft 1997 AQMP reached similar conclusions and proposed to further reduce emissions through measures that are based on specific technological advancements and control methods that can not be reasonably expected to be implemented today.  Recent promising advancements suggest that such technologies could become commercially viable and implemented between 2005 and 2010.  See Appendix F of this EIR for an expanded discussion of long-term or Section 182(e)(5) control measures.
<A ID="E11E4" NAME="E11E4"></A>
<p><B>Section 182(e)(5) Control Measures</B>
<P>Section 182(e)(5) of the federal Clean Air Act allows extreme ozone nonattainment areas to develop control measures which rely on anticipated development of new control techniques or improvement of existing control technologies.  An enforceable commitment must be made to develop and adopt contingency measures to be implemented should the proposed control measures fail to meet stated emission reductions.  Contingency measures for the Section 182(e)(5) measures must be submitted to the U.S. EPA no later than three years before proposed implementation of the Section 182(e)(5) measures.
<P>Many of the long-term emission reduction measures (Tables 2-6) which rely on technologies that are not fully developed for commercial use (such as fuel cells, hydrogen engines, and fly-wheel batteries) are considered to fall into the Section 182(e)(5) classification.  However, measures such as market-incentive programs which promote the advancement of new technologies, or long-term measures which have future compliance dates beyond 2000, are not considered Section 182(e)(5) control measures.  These measures not included in Section 182(e)(5) may be added at a later date.

<P>Operational Measures for Heavy-Duty Vehicles</TABLE></center><P>As part of its action on the 1994 California Ozone SIP, an &quot;additional measures&quot; approach was provided by ARB to achieve further mobile source emission reductions.  The specific control approaches were identified with the adoption of the 1994 California Ozone SIP.  Many of the advanced technology projects could be feasible by the mid-2000s and would complement the market-based approaches for these additional measures.  The 1997 AQMP continues to target 2010 technologies and controls.  These technologies and control methods cannot be fully implemented today; however, recent promising advancements suggest that such technologies could be commercially viable and implemented over the next 13  years.
<P>The advanced technologies proposed for implementation in the 1997 AQMP are based largely on the projects funded or co-funded by the District's Technology Advancement Office (TAO), as well as projects funded by the Mobile Source Air Pollution Reduction Review Committee (MSRC) which was established in 1990 with the adoption of Assembly Bill 2766.  The primary purpose of TAO is to conduct public-private research, development, and demonstration projects in order to identify and promote low- and zero-emissions technologies for both mobile and stationary sources.  TAO has developed a Technology Advancement Plan to comply with recent Legislative requirements.  This plan, which will be updated periodically to be as responsive as possible to technological advances, is available from the District upon request and includes an overview of the TAO program, project planning and selection processes, and proposed project areas.
<P>A primary purpose of the MSRC is to ensure that any county air pollution control district or unified air pollution control district has access to the funds necessary to implement the California Clean Air Act (CCAA) of 1988.  AB2766 also created the MSRC to develop a grant program to promote  motor vehicle emission reductions.  To this end, MSRC funding can be solely used to reduce air pollution from motor vehicles needed for implementing the CCAA.  
<P>Some of the key technological advancements resulting from the TAO and MSRC programs are highlighted and reviewed below.  A 1995 report entitled &quot;Building Markets for Low-Emission Technologies and Clean Fuels:  A Status Report on Commercialization and Technology Transfer,&quot; provides more detailed information on TAO-funded technologies.
<A ID="E11E5" NAME="E11E5"></A>
<p><B>Fuel Cells /Advanced Battery Technologies</B>
<P>Advanced zero and near-zero emission technologies (such as fuel cells) are needed to help meet the District&#146;s air quality goals by the year 2010.  If deployed on a large scale, such technologies can achieve substantial air pollution reductions for a wide spectrum of stationary and mobile sources.
<P>Fuel cells are devices that electrochemically convert hydrogen and oxygen into electricity and pure water, with little or no emissions.  Most fuel cell systems obtain oxygen from ambient air.  Hydrogen can be generated through catalytic steam reforming of a hydrogen rich fuel such as methanol or natural gas.  Fuel cells and batteries offer similar advantages over internal combustion engines, including zero or near-zero emissions, high fuel efficiency, good power, few moving parts, and low noise.  A key difference is that unlike batteries, fuel cells can provide continuous operation because they generate power from an external fuel supply.  Thus, fuel cell-electric vehicles offer comparable driving range and refueling time to today&#146;s gasoline vehicles, while battery-electric vehicles must be recharged from the electrical grid over the course of several hours.
<P>Fuel cells are currently being developed for a wide variety of applications, and the District&#146;s technology advancement program has played a leading role in expediting their commercialization.  For example, TAO has formed and convened a Fuel Cell Implementation Task Force to help develop incentives for the manufacture of fuel cell technologies.  TAO is working with the federal government and various private-sector entities to expedite commercialization of proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells in transit buses and automobiles.  As a result of a TAO-cofunded project, by late 1997 one fuel cell manufacturer will deploy 10 prototype PEM fuel cell buses in revenue service at three North American cities.  The manufacturer has now achieved diesel-equivalent power density in its fuel cell powerplant for buses and cars, and is projecting commercialization of PEM fuel cell buses by 2000.  Virtually all the major automobile manufacturers are working on fuel cell passenger cars, and two have announced their intention to conduct pre-production demonstrations of PEM fuel cell cars within the next five years.  TAO is also working with the federal government to develop  methanol-fueled phosphoric acid fuel cell transit buses.  This prototype technology is now being optimized and scaled up, with prospects for commercialization by about 2005.
<P>Progress with fuel cells for stationary applications is also proceeding steadily.  Since the District became the first commercial site for a 200 kW PC-25 Phosphoric Acid Fuel Cell (PAFC) unit for stationary power, more than 70 units are on order or have gone on line around the world.  Units installed between 1993 and 1994 have logged more than 7,500 hours continuously, with an average availability exceeding 95 percent.  Operating efficiency, in terms of thermal input (lower heating value of natural gas) to electrical output, has averaged 40 percent.  Measured emissions are so low that the District has exempted these power plants from all air quality permitting requirements in the greater Los Angeles basin.  Noise levels are also extremely low.  The latest version of this PAFC technology, the PC 25C, is lighter, smaller, and costs about 40 percent less (from $5000 per kW to $3000 per kW) than the original.  The target cost, at which the PC-25 sales are expected to be self-sustaining, is $1,500 per kW.  The manufacturer&#146;s aim is to achieve this cost target by the end of 1998 through increased production and sales.
<P>According to a report sponsored by the ARB, entitled, &quot;Performance and Availability of Batteries for Electric Vehicles:  A Report of the Battery Technical Advisory Panel,&quot; dated December 11, 1995, improved lead-acid and nickel cadmium batteries will be used in electric vehicles in the near future.  However, a variety of advanced battery technologies which will provide greater vehicle range are being developed for use in electric vehicles produced during the 2000 to 2001 time frame and beyond.  Some of the most notable technologies include nickel-metal-hydride, lithium-ion, and sodium-nickel-chloride.  Honda and Toyota have announced they will introduce pilot fleets of electric vehicles with nickel-metal-hydride batteries in 1998.  Refillable zinc-air battery systems which provide long vehicle range are also being developed.
<P>In July 1995, the MSRC funded the &quot;Quick Charge&quot; program, intended as a large-scale pilot demonstration of electric vehicles within the jurisdiction of the District during 1996, 1997, and 1998.  This demonstration will aid local communities, manufacturers, and utilities in testing the consumer market and demonstrating the infrastructure, permitting processes, and coordination necessary for the eventual introduction of larger quantities of electric vehicles.  The pilot demonstration seeks to identify and resolve potential barriers to broad electric vehicle commercialization.  Among the various issues to be addressed are the following:  battery recycling, charging methods, codes and standards, consumer education and training, emergency response training, equipment availability, electric vehicle service capability, fast charging, home charging, incentives, permitting, remote charging, utility capacity, and utility electric rates.
<P>The MSRC has also allocated revenues to be leveraged with local funding to create &quot;Quick Charge&quot; electric vehicle corridor communities.  This program supports the deployment of electric vehicles along designated freeway corridors and within specific communities that have committed to be electric vehicle ready.  Local government will participate in permitting and inspection, adopting codes and ordinances, and providing public recharging infrastructure.
<A ID="E11E6" NAME="E11E6"></A>
<p><B>Alternative Fuels</B>
<P>Significant advancements have been made in the development and use of alternative clean fuels for a variety of on- and off-road mobile sources as well as stationary source applications.  Alternative fuel technologies for on-road sources include methanol, ethanol, propane, compressed natural gas and electricity.  Numerous TAO and MSRC projects have demonstrated the viability of each of these fuels.  While progress has been made, further advancements or infrastructure development are required for full commercialization.
<P>Emission reductions can be expected from light-duty off-road engines based on zero- or near-zero-emission technologies such as electric or battery-powered equipment or fuel cell-powered units.  These technologies are expected to eventually be used for the majority of light-duty off-road equipment (e.g., pumps, compressors, and forklifts).  For heavy-duty off-road engines (i.e., &gt; 50 hp), advanced alternative fuel technologies can be relied upon to achieve additional emissions reductions.  
<P>Many activities of the TAO program are directed at crediting the commercialization of alternative fuel vehicles that are fully certified and warranted under state regulations for light- and medium-duty vehicles.  In January 1994, the ARB certified a 1994 Chrysler natural gas minivan to meet the stringent ultra low-emission vehicle (ULEV) emission standards.  The Dodge Caravans and Plymouth Voyagers were certified to less than half of the nonmethane organic gas (NMOG) standard, one-sixth of the CO standard, and one-tenth of the NO<SUB>x</SUB> standard.  These front-wheel drive vehicles are equipped with a 3.3 liter V-6 engine using a three-way catalytic converter, heated oxygen sensor, and sequential multi-port natural gas fuel injection system.
<P>Retail sale of ARB-certified methanol transitional low-emission vehicles (TLEV) has followed several years of strategically targeted demonstration programs, with co-funding from the TAO program, to address key commercialization barriers.
<P>To date, there are no light- or medium-duty propane vehicles certified to ARB low-emission vehicle standards.  Working both with original equipment manufacturers and aftermarket companies, the TAO program has sponsored projects designed to advance the state of the art in low-emission propane vehicles.
<P>Hydrogen also offers an extremely good fuel option.  It can substantially eliminate a range of criteria, toxic, and global-warming pollutants by significantly reducing tailpipe, refueling, and evaporative emissions.  In addition, since it can be made from water and is recyclable, its supply is potentially inexhaustible.
<P>Hydrogen fuel can be used in dedicated or hybrid internal combustion engines, or in fuel cells.  Ballard and Mercedez-Benz have already made substantial progress in developing hydrogen powered fuel cell vehicles.  However, the entry of such vehicles into the marketplace is constrained due to a complete absence of a hydrogen fueling infrastructure.  However, ARB LEV requirements mandate the establishment of alternate fuel outlets if vehicle sales, propelled by a particular fuel, reach 20,000 or more.
<A ID="E11E7" NAME="E11E7"></A>
<p><B>Renewable Power Generation Technologies</B>
<P>Several technologies are on the horizon that involve the production of fuel for mobile or stationary applications from renewable energy sources.  Some technologies that have been demonstrated either through the efforts of the TAO and MSRC, or by others include: use of photovoltaics to recharge electric vehicles; generation of hydrogen through electrolysis of water which can be utilized for mobile or stationary applications; and generation of electricity with a solar concentrator in combination with a Stirling engine system.
<A ID="E11E8" NAME="E11E8"></A>
<p><B>Advanced Mobile and Transportation Technologies</B>
<A ID="E12E14" NAME="E12E14"></A>
<p><B><I>Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) </I></B>
<P>In recent years, many technological advances have occurred in making the vehicle and the highway more intelligent, mostly in order to improve traffic.  Several technologies are considered part of the general category of ITS including: traffic signal synchronization; interchangeable message signs; traveler information systems; automatic course finders; variable ramp metering; automatic fee collection systems; and vehicle platooning systems.  The District is a major participant in the planning and development of various elements of ITS.
<A ID="E12E15" NAME="E12E15"></A>
<p><B><I>Remote Sensing Devices (RSDs)</I></B>
<P>Remote sensing devices are instruments capable of measuring instantaneous concentrations of pollutants in the exhaust of vehicles.  These devices have been in the development stages for several years and are now commercially available.  TAO and others have been extensively involved in the research, development and application of remote sensing devices.  
<P>In recent years, major advancements have been made in the technical capabilities of the devices such as the ability to measure volatile organic compounds, oxides of nitrogen, and carbon monoxide.  In addition, a program funded by TAO demonstrated that RSDs can be used to detect high emitting vehicles, and that most of these vehicles can be repaired at reasonable cost.
<A ID="E12E16" NAME="E12E16"></A>
<p><B><I>Advanced Add-On Control Technologies</I></B>
<P>Significant research is in progress to advance control technologies for on-road motor vehicles.  For gasoline vehicles, improvements in three-way catalytic converter technology (such as the utilization of greater catalyst loadings, improved wash coats, and electrically heated catalysts) have shown the potential to further reduce volatile organic compounds and oxides of nitrogen emissions by more than 80 and 50 percent, respectively.  Improvements in fuel management techniques, in an effort to maintain stoichiometric air fuel mixtures during warm engine operating conditions, have also been responsible for substantial reductions in vehicle emissions.  These techniques include sequential fuel injection, dual oxygen sensor systems, and adaptive transient control. These  technologies are  transferable to off-road mobile source applications as well as to the existing on-road vehicle fleet whose emission control systems have deteriorated or are of less advanced design.
<P>Relative to diesel-powered vehicles, it is anticipated that improvements in NOx reduction technologies will occur in the areas of lean NOx catalysts and exhaust gas circulation.  In addition, alternative fuels such as methanol and natural gas, used in diesel engine applications, have shown the potential to reduce NOx emissions by more than 50 percent.  These technologies are expected to be transferable to off-road mobile source applications.  
<A ID="E11E9" NAME="E11E9"></A>
<p><B>Stationary and Area Source Technologies</B>
<A ID="E12E17" NAME="E12E17"></A>
<p><B><I>Zero-VOC Coating Formulations </I></B>
<P>Significant advancements have been made relative to the development and application of zero- or near-zero-VOC coating formulations.  Powder coating applications for metal surfaces, as well as waterborne lacquers used for wood products, are examples of technological advancements that have developed over the last 5 to 10 years.  The focus of the long-term control measure for this source category is primarily small and unpermitted sources.  Therefore, in addition to improvements in control technologies, innovative implementation mechanisms are needed to successfully carry out the control program.
<A ID="E12E18" NAME="E12E18"></A>
<p><B><I>Zero-VOC Consumer Products</I></B>
<P>Hair care products, deodorants and laundry cleaning materials are examples of products that contain VOCs.  The use of these products represents a significant source of emissions.  Lower VOC containing products have been developed, in part due to the California consumer products regulations.  Further development and use of less-polluting products are key technological advancements proposed in this AQMP.   
<A ID="E12E19" NAME="E12E19"></A>
<p><B><I>Fugitive Emissions</I></B>
<P>Fugitive emissions from industrial processes, chemical plants, refineries, and oil and gas production sources, or transfer and storage of organic materials contribute to overall VOC emissions.  Efficient and cost-effective technologies such as enhanced inspection and maintenance programs, leakless valves, or vapor recovery devices are critical to achieving further reductions of fugitive emissions.
<A ID="E12E20" NAME="E12E20"></A>
<p><B><I>Miscellaneous Sources</I></B>
<P>This source category represents many small and unspecified emission sources and yet when considered in aggregate, contributes significantly to the overall emissions in the region.  In order to develop an effective emission reduction strategy for these sources, a better emission inventory specifically identifying the sources of emissions is necessary.  Applicable controls can then be developed in conjunction with better management practices and effective regulatory programs to reduce emissions.
<A ID="E11E10" NAME="E11E10"></A>
<p><B>Contingency Measures</B>
<P>To improve air quality as specified in the AQMP, the control measures listed in the AQMP must be adopted and implemented within the time frames set forth therein.  The expected progress in meeting the AQMP attainment goals, measured in terms of emission reductions, is verified through a three-year auditing program, referred to as reasonable further progress (RFP).  In the event the RFP shows that implementation of the AQMP is not providing adequate progress and the interim emission reduction goals have not been met, the District must take action to bring forward measures that are scheduled for later adoption or implementation, or to implement certain &quot;contingency&quot; control measures.  These contingency measures are control options that could be instituted in addition to the AQMP control measures.  Both state and federal Clean Air Acts require that district plans include contingency measures.  In addition, several measures are identified for further evaluation which could be adopted in the future if later found to be feasible.
<P>A total of 24 control measures have been identified and categorized in two groups:  Level I, or contingency measures, and Level II, or further study measures which are not feasible at this time.  Level II measures will be reevaluated to determine if they are needed to attain state air quality standards or potential future federal ozone and particulates air quality standards.  Table 2-7 lists the Level I measures and Table 2-8 lists the Level II measures.  The following paragraphs provide a summary of these control measures.  A complete discussion is included in Appendix IV, Section 6 of the AQMP.

<p><B><I>Level I:  Contingency  Measures</I></B>
<P>Level I measures (Table 2-7) are actions that can be implemented given existing statutory authority.  The responsibility to adopt and implement the Level I measures falls variously on the District, ARB, and U.S. EPA.  The measures would be adopted in the order specified in the 1997 AQMP until the shortfall is eliminated.  A ranking of the importance of each measure relative to ozone, carbon monoxide and PM10 planning requirements under the federal Clean Air Act is provided in Table 2-7 for the Level I measures.  (See also Chapter 9 of the 1997 AQMP.)

<P>Level II measures (Table 2-8) are measures from the 1994 AQMP which have been determined as having low emission reduction potential, with a corresponding high administrative burden, or having low cost-effectiveness.  Therefore, these measures require further evaluation.  It has been further demonstrated that the federal ambient air quality standards can be attained within the statutory time frames without these measures.

<br>3 = Minimal emissions reduction potential (H&amp;SC 40922(b)) and not feasible due to social impact   considerations and cost of administrative burden (PRC 21061.1).
<br>4 = Low public acceptability (H&amp;SC 40922(b)) and not feasible due to social impact considerations (PRC 21061.1).
<P>The rationale for concluding that each Level II contingency control measure is not feasible at this time is explained in the following paragraphs.
<P><B>CMB-01</B> Phase II RECLAIM would expand the RECLAIM program to facilities with NOx &amp; SOx emission reductions below 4 tons per year.  Expanding the RECLAIM program poses an extensive administrative burden to the District and some of the subject facilities.  The total amount of NOx emission reductions expected is approximately 1.12 tons per day.  The minimal emission reduction of CMB-01 does not justify the cost of the administrative burden.  Additionally, the further control of some internal combustion engines in this category is not technically feasible.
<P><B>CMB-02</B> Emission reductions from non-RECLAIM combustion sources would involve the regulation of thousands of non-permitted emission sources.  Implementing the control measure would require the identifying and on-going enforcement of thousands of currently unpermitted combustion sources.  At this time there is no technology for further control of the internal combustion engines which would be part of this control measure.  In addition, the administrative burden and lack of control technology make this measure infeasible at this time.
<P><B>CMB-08</B> The emission reductions which could result from the control of gas-fired petroleum refining process heaters is not quantifiable at this time.  Uncertainty as to the potential emission reduction technology prevents the District from establishing an emission reduction factor for this control measure.  It is believed also that the emission reductions would be minimal.  The emission uncertainty combined with uncertainty as to the number of sources subject to the measure, results in an inability to establish cost effectiveness.  This measure is, therefore, considered neither technically nor economically feasible at this time.
<P><B>CMB-10</B><B> </B>Glass melting furnaces not subject to the RECLAIM program represent a small emission source category.  Potential emission reductions from this category, even with a high control efficiency, would be low.  The emission reductions expected from this control measure are less than 20 pounds per day of NOx.  The administrative burden of bringing such a rule forward, at this time, is not justifiable for the minimal emission reductions likely.
<P><B>CMB-11</B> Non-RECLAIM incinerators represent a small emission source category.  The further emission reduction potential which could be achieved by this control measure would, therefore, be relatively low regardless of the control efficiency factor.  This control measure has an estimated emission reduction below 20 pounds per day of NOx.  The administrative burden of developing a rule is not justified at this time for such a minimal emission reduction.
<P><B>CTS-02D(1) </B>and<B> CTS-02D(2)</B> These measures would further regulate emissions from marine vessel and pleasure craft coatings respectively.  Both of those categories represent small emission sources.  The emission reductions which could be expected from the two control measures combined represents a total of approximately 60 pounds of VOC per day.  The administrative burden of developing a rule is not justified at this time for such a minimal emission reduction.
<P><B>CTS-02G</B> This contingency measure calls for further emission reductions from paper, fabric and film coating operations.  The estimated emission reductions which might be achievable from this measure are also relatively small (360 pounds of VOC per day).  Considering the costs of rule development and implementation that would be required of the District, as well as high compliance costs for minor emission reductions, implementation of this measure is not feasible at this time.
<P><B>CTS-02I(1)</B> The potential emission reductions which could be achieved from implementation of this control measure are minimal when compared to the administrative burden of developing the rule.  In addition, there is also technical uncertainty associated with the control technology.  This currently infeasible control measure is, therefore, being delayed due to the cost of the administrative burden relative to the minimal gain in emission reductions.
<P><B>CTS-02J </B>Currently, there is new coating technology which could achieve the targeted further emission reductions from the coating of wood products.  However, due to industry concern with the availability and feasibility of this coating technology facing this control measure, it has been moved to level II contingency status and will continue to be evaluated.
<P><B>CTS-02K</B> Aerospace assembly and component manufacturing operations are already regulated to a great extent.  The further emission reductions which would be targeted by this control measure are minimal, amounting to approximately 160 additional pounds of VOC per day.  The administrative burdens of rule development are not justified at this time for such a minimal emission reduction.  The measure has, therefore, been moved to a level II contingency and will be subject to future evaluation.  
<P><B>CTS-02L </B>This contingency measure would further regulate the emissions from motor vehicle assembly line operations, of which there is currently only one in the Basin.  The expected emission reductions of 60 pounds per day of VOC.  The administrative costs of rule development do not justify pursuing the measure at this time.
<P><B>PRC-02</B><B> </B>This measure&#146;s aim of achieving further emission reductions from bakery operations would require the application of control on low-emitting bakeries.  Larger emitting bakeries are currently controlled by the terms of existing Rule 1153.  The remaining bakeries represent a small source category and the expected emission reductions would be minimal (approximately 160 pounds per day of VOC).  At this time it is more cost effective to proceed with the implementation of other measures which can achieve a greater emission reduction at equal or lesser administrative cost.
<P><B>PRC-05</B><B> </B>The malt beverage, wine and brandy producing facilities within the District&#146;s jurisdiction represent a minimal emissions source category.  The anticipated emission reductions from this control measure would be less than 20 pounds per day.  The administrative burden of proceeding with implementation of this measure is not at this time justified by the minimal emission reductions that would be gained.

<P>The rationale for deleting these control measures from the 1997 AQMP is explained in the following paragraphs.
<P><B>CMB-05</B> This control measure was intended to achieve emission reductions by requiring the use of clean fuels in stationary sources.  The NOx emission reductions which were expected from this control measure will be achieved through the implementation of existing NOx control rules.  Additionally, due to issues of safety and operating requirements, it is not feasible in all circumstances to completely eliminate the option for stationary sources to use standard fuels as a back up fuel during emergencies or other unexpected situations.  
<P><B>CTS-01</B>  The proposal to implement a RECLAIM program for VOC emissions has been placed on hold at this date.  In place of CTS-01, substitution control measures from the 1994 AQMP are proposed to be implemented in the 1997.  This measure is not considered socially feasible due to the rejection of the market incentive measure for VOC sources.
<P><B>CTS-02F</B> This control measure calls for further control of current by regulated Rule 1151 sources.  The measure would affect a large number of very small operations.  The costs of implementing the measure are high and the emission reduction potential is minimal in comparison to the number of sources involved.  The measure is, therefore, not considered to be feasible due to its high impact on small operations and the costs of implementation.
<P><B>CTS-02I(2)</B> The further control of emissions from graphic arts operations was found not to be cost effective.  Given the existing control on graphic arts operations and the control cost this additional measure would place on these operations compared to the amount of emission reductions that would be achieved, the measure has been dropped.
<P><B>ISR-01 </B>through<B> ISR-05</B> These control measures would have required actions by indirect sources to reduce emissions resulting from vehicle trips.  The administrative burden of implementing indirect source control measures is considerable.  In addition, the emission reduction potential of such measures is to a large extent dependent upon the public&#146;s acceptance of the measures and its willingness to alter vehicle use behavior in compliance with the measure.  The measures were dependent upon voluntary actions, had a very low level of social acceptability and as such would not be likely to achieve the targeted emission reductions to the extent those reductions were dependent upon voluntary actions.  These measures are considered not feasible for social reasons and poor cost effectiveness.
<P><B>PRC-04</B> The emission reduction potential from control of rubber products manufacturing envisioned in this measure is below 20 pounds per day.  The minimal emission reduction potential of this measure is outweighed by the costs and administrative burden of adopting the measure.
<P><B>RFL-01</B> The emission reductions that might be achieved by implementation of this measure are dependent upon control emissions which result from individuals filling small fuel containers and then transferring that fuel to various pieces of utility equipment, such as gasoline powered lawnmowers, power saws, etc.  The ability to implement and enforce such a measure is tied to the ability to inspect and monitor the fueling behavior of countless consumers.  The administrative burden faced by the District would be extensive.  When compared to the minimal emission reduction potential (80 pounds per day of VOC), the measure is simply not cost effective.
<P><B>RFL-03</B>  The controlling of emissions from pleasure boat refueling operations could result in VOC emission reductions of up to 1.5 tons per day.  Upon analysis of the measure and its implementation, the U.S. Coast Guard raised issues of safety for the fueling public.  Until the safety concerns can be adequately addressed implementation of this measure remains infeasible.

<P>Implementation of the AQMP's strategies requires a cooperative partnership of government agencies at the federal, state, regional and local level (Table 2-11).

<P>At the regional level, the District is responsible for the overall development and implementation of the AQMP.  The District is specifically authorized to reduce emissions from stationary, indirect and some area sources.  The District implements its responsibilities with participation from the regulated community through an extensive rule development and implementation program.  This approach maximizes the input of those parties affected by the proposed rule through consultation meetings, public workshops, and on going working groups.
<P>At the local level, local governments serve an important role in developing and implementing transportation control measures.  SCAG also provides assessments for conformity of regionally significant projects with the overall AQMP and is responsible for the adoption of the annual Regional Transportation Improvement Program.
<A ID="E10E3" NAME="E10E3"></A>
<p><B>Coachella Valley PM10 Plan</B>
<P>Under the 1990 amendments to the federal Clean Air Act (CAA), the Coachella Valley was designated as a &quot;moderate&quot; PM10 nonattainment area.  Unlike the Basin where PM10 exceedances are due primarily to PM10 precursor pollutants, the Coachella Valley&#146;s elevated PM10 levels are strongly tied to local fugitive dust problems.  In response to CAA requirements for moderate nonattainment areas, the District developed the &quot;State Implementation Plan for PM10 in the Coachella Valley&quot; (90-CVSIP).  The 90-CVSIP contained reasonably available control measures (RACM) to reduce fugitive dust.
<P>Because the Coachella Valley did not achieve the federal PM10 standard by December 1994 as required by the CAA, it was redesignated as a serious nonattainment area by the U.S. EPA.  As a result of the Coachella Valley being reclassified as a serious PM10 nonattainment area, the District was required to prepare a SIP containing best available control measures (BACM) to further control fugitive dust.  The District prepared and adopted the 1994 Coachella Valley PM10 SIP (94-CVSIP) in July 1994.
<P>Except for one exceedance of the 24-hour PM10 standard [  This exceedance occurred on a day where maximum hourly wind gusts exceeded 50 mph for each hour of the day.  The U.S. EPA recently established a natural events policy that excludes air quality data attributable to uncontrolled natural events, such as high winds.  As a result, the exceedance of the 24-hour PM10 standard is excluded from the Coachella Valley PM10 data.] , there were no PM10 exceedances in the Coachella Valley for the years 1993, 1994, or 1995.  With the exclusion of the one 24-hour exceedance, the Coachella Valley is eligible for redesignation.  Based upon supporting meteorological data regarding the one high wind event in 1995, the District is preparing a maintenance plan for the Coachella Valley.  The Coachella Valley Maintenance plan will be prepared as a separate document and will undergo a separate CEQA analysis.  These documents will be released for public review and submitted to the U.S. EPA prior to February, 1997.  For additional information on the Coachella Valley PM10 Plan, the reader is referred to Chapter 8 of the 1997 AQMP.

<a name = "projectalt"><H3><B>PROJECT ALTERNATIVES</B></H3></a>
<P>CEQA requires an EIR to describe and evaluate the comparative merits of a range of reasonable alternatives to a proposed project [CEQA Guidelines Section 15126 (d)].  Alternatives chosen for analysis should feasibly attain the basic objectives of the proposed project.  The range of alternatives required in an EIR is governed by the &quot;rule of reason&quot; that the EIR set forth only those alternatives necessary to permit a reasoned choice.  The key issue is whether the selection and discussion of alternatives fosters informed decisionmaking and informed public participation.  An EIR need not consider an alternative whose effect cannot be reasonably ascertained and whose implementation is remote and speculative [CEQA Guidelines Section 15126 (d)(5)(c)].
<A ID="E10E4" NAME="E10E4"></A>
<p><B>Development of Alternatives</B>
<P>The alternatives typically included in CEQA documents for proposed District rules, regulations, or plans are developed by breaking down the project into distinct components (e.g., emission limits, compliance dates, applicability, exemptions, etc.) and then varying the specifics of one or more of the components.  Different compliance approaches that generally achieve the objectives of the project may also be considered as project alternatives.
<P>The possible alternatives to the proposed 1997 AQMP are limited by the nature of the project.  The CCAA requires the District to reduce pollutants contributing to nonattainment by five percent per year or to the maximum extent feasible.  As such, the proposed 1997 AQMP and any acceptable project alternatives must comply with this criteria to attain the basic objectives of the project.  Consequently, all viable project alternatives must include all short- and intermediate-term control measures identified in the draft 1997 AQMP (i.e., all feasible measures).
<P>Similar to the difference between the 1994 and 1997 AQMPs, the differences among the alternatives included and analyzed in this EIR appear mainly in the later years of the plan when implementation of potential long-term control measures is scheduled to occur.  The alternatives vary mainly with regard to the applicability or penetration of certain advanced technologies.  Other basic project components which vary among the alternatives include a seasonal shift of VOC emissions to winter months and greater emphasis on PM10 control measures versus NOx control.  The following subsections provide brief descriptions of each of the project alternatives (see also Table 2-12).
<A ID="E10E5" NAME="E10E5"></A>
<p><B>Alternatives Rejected as Infeasible</B>
<P>The CEQA Guidelines (Section 15126(d)) and CEQA case law encourage the discussion in the EIR of the process through which the lead agency developed project alternatives that were considered and rejected, and the reasons for rejecting them.  The District considered the following two potential project alternatives, but both were rejected as infeasible.
<A ID="E11E14" NAME="E11E14"></A>
<p><B>No Project Alternative - No Further Action</B>
<P>CEQA documents typically assume that the adoption of a no project alternative would result in no further action on the part of the project proponent or lead agency.  For example, in the case of a proposed land use project such as a housing development, adopting the No Project Alternative terminates further consideration of that housing development or any housing development alternative identified in the associated CEQA document.  In that case, the existing setting would remain unchanged.
<P>The concept of taking no further action (and thereby leaving the existing setting intact) by adopting a no project alternative does not readily apply to an update of an already adopted and legally mandated plan such as the AQMP.  Adopting a no project alternative for an update to the AQMP does not imply that no further action will be taken (i.e., halting implementation of existing AQMP control measures); it assumes continued implementation of the existing AQMP.  As detailed in Chapter 1 of this EIR, the federal and state Clean Air Acts require the District to revise and implement the AQMP in order to attain ambient air quality standards.  A no further action no project alternative, in the case of the AQMP, is not a legally viable alternative and, therefore, will not be considered further in this EIR.  Consequently, the no project alternative presented in this EIR is the continued implementation of the previously adopted 1994 AQMP.
<P>For information purposes, it should be noted that, except for air quality, there would be no further incremental impacts on the existing environment if no further action is taken.  There would, however, be no further improvements in air quality if no emissions controls beyond those currently required are implemented.  In fact air quality would be expected to deteriorate substantially if no further emission controls are implemented.  The projected baseline air quality would represent a no further action scenario.  Further, all areas within the jurisdiction of the District would not attain state and national ambient air quality standards as required by the state and federal Clean Air Acts.
<A ID="E11E15" NAME="E11E15"></A>
<p><B>Geographic Shift Control Strategy</B>
<P>Geographic or spatial emission reduction programs offer a potential alternative method of reducing ambient concentrations of atmospheric pollutants.  During the development of the 1994 AQMP, the 1994 AQMP EIR presented an alternative of implementing long-term control measures in targeted geographic locations only.  The air quality models used at that time could only evaluate emissions down to the precision of county levels.  Based on the meteorology and spatial arrangement of emission sources in the Basin (i.e., the majority of the industrial and commercial emission sources are located in the coastal plain of the region), the alternative in the 1994 AQMP EIR specified Los Angeles and Orange counties as the areas where long-term VOC point source control measures would be implemented.  This alternative was rejected, however, because it was not as effective in achieving state and national ambient air quality standards as the alternative ultimately selected.
<P>A geographic shift control strategy would require implementing the same short- and intermediate-term control measures contained in the proposed 1997 AQMP.  It would also specify particular geographic locations for implementing targeted long-term control measures.  Improvements in air quality modeling tools allow the District to model geographic areas as small as the 38 source receptor areas within the area of the District&#146;s jurisdiction.  Consequently, a geographic shift alternative would reduce emission by implementing advanced control measures in specifically selected source receptor areas in the area of the District&#146;s jurisdiction that contribute more significantly to exceedances of the ambient air quality standards.  Under a geographic shift alternative only those facilities within the selected source receptor areas would be subject to the control requirements established for each rule.  District engineering and enforcement efforts could possibly be reduced due to the fewer number of facilities subject to the specified rules and their concentration in localized geographic areas.
<P>Air quality modeling was performed for the geographic shift alternative to determine its viability as a project alternative.  The geographic shift alternative proved difficult to model because the model is dependent on meteorological conditions.  For example, depending on the meteorological conditions of the model, it was difficult to determine whether or not an exceedance in a source receptor area was due to the emissions sources in that receptor area or the result of wind conditions in which emissions from an optional source receptor area were transported to a second source receptor area, causing a violation in the second source receptor area.  Because of the uncertainty of the source of emissions causing a violation, it was not possible to develop a control strategy demonstrating attainment of all ambient air quality standards.  This alternative was, therefore, rejected as being infeasible at this time.
<A ID="E10E6" NAME="E10E6"></A>
<p><B>Alternatives to the 1997 AQMP</B>
<A ID="E11E16" NAME="E11E16"></A>
<p><B>Alternative 1 - No Project Alternative (1994 AQMP)</B>
<P>CEQA requires the specific alternative of no project to be evaluated.  A no project alternative consists of what would occur if the project was not approved; in this case, not adopting a 1997 AQMP.  The net effect of not adopting the 1997 AQMP would be a continuation of the existing 1994 AQMP.  The No Project Alternative analyzed here will take into account the most current air quality setting (1995) and will include updated and refined controls measures.
<P>The No Project Alternative is an extension of the existing 1994 AQMP with a few notable exceptions.  First, a revised rule adoptions and implementation schedule has been submitted to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for inclusion in the 1994 California SIP.  This schedule shifts the projected dates when emission reductions will be achieved and now constitutes the No Project Alternative.  Although the 1994 AQMP included PM10 BACMs, the SIP submittal contained only those measures necessary to demonstrate ozone attainment.  The additional NOx measures which would have been necessary to demonstrate PM10 attainment were not part of that submittal.  Furthermore, the RECLAIM program for VOC is no longer being pursued by the District as a viable market incentives program.  It is removed as part of the No Project Alternative.
<A ID="E11E17" NAME="E11E17"></A>
<p><B>Alternative 2 - Temporal/Seasonal Shift Control Strategy</B>
<P>The 1994 AQMP EIR explored an alternative that contained a long-term control strategy for reducing ozone which focused primarily on shifting mobile source emissions to different periods of the day, e.g., late afternoon or night, less conducive to the formation of photochemical pollutants.  The 1994 AQMP EIR concluded that a long-term strategy based on such an approach could provide equivalent air quality benefits.  It was also concluded, however, that this alternative could have significant transportation/circulation impacts (compared to insignificant transportation/circulation impacts from the 1994 AQMP) and, therefore, was rejected.
<P>Alternative 2 to the 1997 AQMP considers implementation of short- and intermediate-term, as well as advanced, control measures that would allow regulated facilities to shift emissions from high ozone formation periods (i.e., summer) to low ozone formation periods (i.e., winter).  Alternative 2 is based in part on preliminary analyses conducted for the District&#146;s proposed Intercredit Trading Program (Regulation XXV).  In the process of evaluating this program, air quality sensitivity analyses were conducted to determine if there would be a net air quality benefit if some VOC emissions were shifted from the summer to the winter months.  This analysis revealed that potential air quality benefits could occur from reducing VOC emissions during the summer ozone season.  Further, air quality and health benefits could be maximized from a program that encourages interseasonal trading where winter months are defined as November through April.
<A ID="E11E18" NAME="E11E18"></A>
<p><B>Alternative 3 - Fugitive Dust Versus NOx Control Strategy</B>
<P>Instead of implementing NOx control measures requiring maximum control effectiveness, Alternative 3 would require implementing fugitive dust control contingency measures CTY 12 - Control Emissions from Paved Roads - Curb and Gutter/Chemical Stabilization (formerly BCM-01 (1D and 1E)) and CTY-13 - Further Emission Reductions from Construction and Demolition Activities (Rule 403) (formerly BCM-02). To provide a &quot;worst-case&quot; analysis, this alternative assumes that all NOx control measures identified in the 1997 AQMP would be implemented, but the control efficiency required would not need to be as great as would be required under the 1997 AQMP.

<p><a name = "current"><H3><B>CURRENT AIR POLLUTION REDUCTION STRATEGIES</B></H3>
<P>The following subsections specifically identify and describe air pollution control technologies that could be used to reduce emissions pursuant to emission reduction requirements in the various control measures of the 1997 AQMP.
<A ID="E10E7" NAME="E10E7"></A>
<p><B>Stationary Source Control Strategies</B>
<P>Stationary sources include both &quot;point&quot; and &quot;area&quot; sources.  A point source has one or more pieces of permitted equipment in a fixed, identifiable location.  An area source is generally a small facility, piece of non-permitted equipment or other source of emissions with a location not specifically identified.  Some of the most common methods of controlling stationary sources of VOC, NOx and PM10 emissions are summarized in the following subsections.
<A ID="E11E19" NAME="E11E19"></A>
<p><B>Volatile Organic Compound Control</B>
<P>Methods of reducing VOC emissions include reducing the VOC content of coating products and solvent materials through using aqueous or reformulated materials, or by installing add-on air pollution control equipment.
<P>Non-traditional coatings and coating methods include waterborne coatings and cleaning materials, powder coatings, radiation-curable coatings, and high solids coatings.
<P><B>Waterborne Coatings</B>:  Waterborne coatings are available as &quot;latexes&quot; and &quot;water-reducibles.&quot;  The latexes are similar to paints that are offered to home owners for the coatings of walls, ceilings, etc.  Water-reducibles are based on a different technology.  A water-reducible coating is specifically formulated to use water as the major volatile component, but some percentage of organic solvents may be used in the formulation as well.  The vehicle components in the coating have been chemically modified to form a stable aqueous material.
<P><B>Powder Coatings:</B>  Powder coatings form films by the coalescence of finely powdered solid resins.  A common type of powder coating is made from epoxy resin particles applied by either fluidized bed or spray equipment.
<P><B>Radiation-curable Coatings:</B>  Radiation-curable coatings require the use of either infra-red or ultraviolet (UV) light ovens to accelerate or catalyze the cross-linking or curing process of the coating.  Both oven types generate a high degree of heat, usually much higher than conventional gas-fired drying ovens.  
<P><B>High Solids Coatings:</B>  High solids coatings are those in which a minimum of 55 percent of the total coating volume as applied is composed of film-formers, resins, primary pigments, and inert fillers, the balance being volatile compounds such as organic solvents or water.  Standard coating formulations normally consist of a maximum solids content of 30 percent.
<P>Add-on control technologies can be used as an alternative to reformulated coatings.  The two primary types of add-on equipment for VOC control are carbon adsorption and incineration devices.  Condensers may also be used to control VOC emissions either directly or as an auxiliary to incineration or adsorption.
<P><B>Carbon Adsorption:  </B>In a carbon adsorption unit, the exhaust air flows through a carbon bed where the contaminants in the air stream are separated from the effluent and adsorbed onto the surface of the carbon particles.  Depending on the application, carbon adsorbers can achieve a removal efficiency of nearly 100 percent with a slight decline in removal efficiency as the carbon bed becomes saturated.
<P>Carbon adsorption devices are used for both vapor solvent recovery and liquid solvent recovery.  Liquid solvent recovery is not applicable to air pollution control and, therefore, is not discussed further.  
<P>Vapor solvent recovery has two components, aqueous phase vapor recovery and gaseous phase vapor recovery.  Aqueous phase vapor recovery uses activated carbon to remove organic substances.  Gaseous phase vapor recovery systems, the type typically used for air pollution control, use a carbonized organic material as an activated carbon source to remove organic substances from gas streams.
<P>When the vapor recovery carbon becomes saturated with organic material, it is removed and regenerated (usually offsite) typically using a rotary kiln to oxidize the organic material.  During the regeneration process approximately five percent of the activated carbon is lost.  This loss is replaced with new activated carbon and the entire amount is then reused.  Vapor phase recovery carbon can be continuously regenerated, replenished, and reused.
<P><B>Incineration:  </B>Thermal incineration has a wide range of applications and is the most universally applied control method for organics because it is a &quot;destructive&quot; control technique in which the pollutants are destroyed, (i.e., oxidized to carbon dioxide, water vapor and other products of combustion).  At a minimum, incinerators typically consist of a burner to ignite the compounds and a chamber in which the compound resides for a specified time to maximize oxidation.  For effective operation, incinerators require the proper balance of time, temperature and turbulence to completely oxidize pollutants.  The rate at which the compound is oxidized is greatly affected by the temperature within the combustion device.  
<P>The two basic types of incinerators are thermal oxidizers and catalytic oxidizers.  Thermal oxidizers are classified by their use of heat recovery (afterburners), recuperative heat recovery, or highly efficient regenerative heat recovery.
<P>Thermal oxidizers and afterburners rely on direct contact between pollutants and high-temperature flames.   Catalytic oxidizers rely on an active catalyst bed at moderate temperatures to oxidize the pollutants.
<P><B>Condensers:</B>  VOC can be condensed either by increasing pressure or extracting heat.  Air pollution control condensers typically operate through the removal of heat from the vapor.  The two basic types of condensers are surface condensers and contact condensers.
<P>In surface condensers, the coolant does not contact the vapor or condensate.  Most surface condensers are of the tube and shell type.  Water flows inside a tube, and vapors condense on the shell side.  The water is normally chilled in a cooling tower, and reused.  Contact condensers employ liquid coolants, usually water, which come in direct contact with the organic vapors causing them to condense.

<p><B>NOx   Control Technologies</B>
<P>NOx is formed by the oxidation of atmospheric nitrogen during combustion and from the oxidation of bound nitrogen in organic fuels.  The amount of NOx formed depends, in part, on the amount of available air supply and the combustion temperature.  Two major categories of NOx control options are currently available for stationary sources:  (1) combustion modification, and (2) flue gas treatment systems.
<P>Combustion modification methods reduce NOx flue gas concentrations, either by lowering the combustion temperature or reducing the amount of oxygen available for combustion.  The actual NOx reduction achieved is case-specific and depends upon the technology employed.  In general, combustion modification reduces NOx by approximately 10 - 70 percent from baseline emission values.  Seven of the most widely used combustion modification technologies include: low excess air burner; staged air burners; low-NOx burners; oxygen trim; staged fuel burners; flue gas recirculation; and ceramic fiber burners.
<P><B>Low Excess Air Burners:  </B>Low-excess air burners require less oxygen for combustion because air and fuel are thoroughly mixed prior to combustion, thus requiring less excess air.  Although fuel is more completely burned in this process, reducing excess oxygen tends to reduce combustion efficiency while increasing CO and particulate emissions.  Low-excess air burners have a maximum NOx emission reduction efficiency of approximately 25 percent.
<P><B>Staged Air Burners:  </B>Staged air burners divide the combustion fuel mixture into two or more streams before combustion.  The first stream flows into a fuel-rich zone where the fuel is partially burned.  At this stage, thermal NOx formation is reduced because of the lack of excess oxygen.  The remainder of the combustion air is mixed with the partially burned combustion air downstream of the fuel-rich zone where combustion is then completed.  At this stage, NOx formation is reduced because of a lower flame temperature.  Staged air burners have a maximum NOx reduction efficiency of about 30 percent.
<P><B>Flue Gas Recirculation:  </B>Flue gas recirculation is a control technique in which the flue gas is mixed with incoming combustion air.  This process limits the oxygen level, resulting in a lower flame temperature and a lower peak combustion temperature, thus reducing thermal NOx formation.  This method alone reduces NOx formation by approximately 50 percent for gaseous fuel firing.  In some circumstances, flue gas recirculation in conjunction with other control techniques, staged air burners for example, can achieve a NOx reduction efficiency approaching 70 percent.
<P><B>Low-NO</B><B>x</B><B> Burners:  </B>Low-NOx burners use a combination of fuel rich mixtures and staged combustion to control combustion and reduce NOx flue gas concentrations.  This method reduces NOx formation by approximately 50 percent.  This technology can be used in conjunction with flue gas recirculation to achieve additional NOx reductions.
<P><B>O</B><B>x</B><B>ygen Trim:  </B>Mechanical equipment can be used to reduce the excess oxygen by using oxygen trim.  This method involves combustion at a low air to fuel ratio, still allowing for complete fuel combustion.  Oxygen trim can increase boiler fuel combustion efficiency, which can result in a fuel savings of 1 to 2 percent.  This method has a NOx emission reduction efficiency of 10 to 25 percent.
<P><B>Staged Fuel Burners:  </B>Staged fuel burners divide the fuel into two or more streams.  One fuel stream flows into, and is burned in a lean primary combustion zone.  The remainder of the fuel is then mixed with the partially burned fuel downstream of the lean primary combustion zone.  This process lowers the peak flame temperature, which reduces thermal NOx formation.  Staged fuel burners have a maximum NO<SUB>x</SUB> emission reduction efficiency of approximately 55 percent.
<P><B>Ceramic Fiber Burner:  </B>An emerging NOx control technology that requires additional retrofit demonstration on boiler equipment is a ceramic fiber burner.  Low NOx levels are achieved due to the slow kinetics of thermal NOx formation.  The largest unit tested so far is a 10 million Btu burner.  Test results indicate NOx emission levels of 50 ppm.
<A ID="E11E21" NAME="E11E21"></A>
<p><B>PM10 Control Technologies<</B>This section specifically discusses control equipment for stationary sources of PM10 emissions.  It should be noted that PM10 is also controlled by reducing the amount of particulate matter entrained in the ambient air as a result of anthropogenic fugitive dust sources by requiring actions to prevent, reduce, or mitigate fugitive dust emissions.  The control of PM10 precursor emissions (i.e., gaseous emissions of SO x , NO x  and VOC) also helps to reduce ambient PM10 concentrations.] </H3>
<P>Filters, scrubbers, mist eliminators, and electrostatic precipitators are used primarily to reduce particulate emissions, although these technologies are also effective in controlling other criteria pollutants and toxic air contaminants.  Each device is briefly discussed below.
<P><B>Filters:</B>  Fibrous or fabric filter media formed into cylindrical sleeves or bags are the most widely used type of dry-particle collector for air cleaning.  Baghouses (the structure supporting the filter) remove solid particulate contaminants from gas streams by filtering them through a fabric media which is generally a woven or felted material.  Several different types of filters may be used within a baghouse depending on the particular source and composition of the particulates or gases to be controlled.
<P><B>Scrubbers:</B> Scrubbers commonly used to control particulate emissions include spray towers, packed bed and venturi (high energy) scrubbers.  These devices utilize a reagent such as sodium or calcium compounds to condense the air contaminant.  Wet scrubbers use water &quot;sprays&quot; to collect and remove particulates (wet scrubbers are not well suited to control very fine particulates).  Packed-bed scrubbers are generally used to remove pollutant gases.  The packed-bed scrubber, or column, is generally a vertical column which has been filled with materials with large surface areas.  The gas stream that contains the pollutant moves upward through the packed bed against an absorbing or reacting liquid that is injected at the top of the packing.  In venturi scrubbers, gases are passed through a venturi tube (a short tube with a constricted, throatlike passage) to which low-pressure water is added at the throat.  The venturi tube increases the velocity and lowers the pressure of the fluid.  In spite of the very short contact time, the turbulence in the venturi promotes very intimate contact between the water and the contaminants.
<P><B>Mist Eliminators:</B>  Mist eliminators are &quot;impaction&quot; collectors that place barriers in the path of the mist particulates in the flowing gas.  These barriers intercept the particulates and remove them from the gas stream.  A de-mister is often used as part of a packed scrubbing device to increase its efficiency in removing fine particulate matter.
<P><B>Electrostatic Precipitators:  </B>These devices use an electrostatic field for precipitating or removing solid or liquid particles from a gas.  The solid or liquid particles are charged, and the electrostatic field causes the charged particles to migrate to a collecting electrode of opposite polarity.  Electrostatic precipitators can handle very large gas flow rates and collect very small particles.
<A ID="E10E8" NAME="E10E8"></A>
<p><B>Market Incentives</B>
<P>Intercredit trading, emission credit generation and air quality investment program are designed to complement command-and-control measures.  The primary objectives of the measures are to enhance regulatory compliance flexibility by providing additional compliance options and thereby lowering compliance costs and to incentivize early reductions and advancement of clean technologies through emission credit banking provisions.
<P>The District has established and successfully implemented the Regional Clean Air Incentives Market (RECLAIM) for NOx and SOx.  RECLAIM is a market incentive program that provides certain applicable industries added flexibility in complying with specified emission reduction requirements.  Under the RECLAIM program, all major stationary sources with NOx and SOx emissions greater than four tons per year, have received an emission cap and an annual rate of reduction.  Each facility's target for emission reductions was determined based upon the pollution reduction required under the 1991 AQMP.  This system complements the existing regulatory program by utilizing creative market force incentives to improve air quality at the lowest possible cost.  Sources included in RECLAIM are expected to utilize the NO<SUB>x</SUB> and SO<SUB>x</SUB> control methods described above as appropriate in achieving their declining emission cap at the lowest cost.
<A ID="E10E9" NAME="E10E9"></A>
<p><B>Mobile Source Strategies</B>
<P>Mobile and transportation-related sources produce the largest amount of pollutant emissions in the District, accounting for at least 60 percent of total emissions.  Control of mobile source emissions includes establishing emission and fuel quality standards.  Mobile sources are divided into on-road vehicles, off-road vehicles, and indirect sources.  The 1997 AQMP does not at this time include any control measures for indirect sources.
<A ID="E11E22" NAME="E11E22"></A>
<p><B>On-road Vehicles</B>
<P>The ARB has primary authority for establishing emission and fuel quality standards relative to on-road vehicles operated in California.  Current emission and fuel quality standards are based on ARB's September 1990 regulations that require low-emission vehicles and clean fuels.
<P><B>Low-Emission Vehicles (LEV):</B> The LEV rulemaking established stringent tail-pipe emission standards, including the reduction of VOC and NO<SUB>x</SUB> emissions by approximately 80 percent and 50 percent, respectively, relative to current emission standards.
<P>Under the LEV program, vehicle manufacturers are required to comply with fleet average tailpipe emission standards by selling any combination of alternative fueled vehicles and electric vehicles.  In addition to electric vehicles, other alternative fuel vehicles technologies for on-road sources include methanol, ethanol, propane (LPG), and compressed natural gas (CNG).  In conjunction with vehicle manufacturer requirements, the LEV program requires widespread availability of alternative fuels by fuel suppliers, based on the number and type of alternative clean fueled vehicles sold in California.
<P><B>Clean Fuels:</B>  The ARB Clean Fuels program establishes requirements for the production and sale of reformulated fuels in two phases.  Phase 1 requirements became effective January 1, 1992, and specified a maximum Reid vapor pressure (RVP) during summer months and a maximum and minimum oxygen content for gasoline.  Phase 1 also required a certification for deposit-control additives, prohibited lead as a gasoline additive, and limited phosphorus content.  
<P>Phase 2 requirements of the Clean Fuels program(now known as the California Cleaner Burning Gasoline) became effective on March 1, 1996.  Primary requirements include specified reductions in the aromatic hydrocarbon and olefin content of gasoline, reductions in T90 and T50 values (the temperature at which 90 percent and 50 percent of the gasoline will evaporate, respectively), and a maximum RVP.
<A ID="E11E23" NAME="E11E23"></A>
<p><B>Off-road Vehicles</B>
<P>Off-road mobile sources refer to off-road vehicles and off-road source categories such as aircraft, trains, marine vessels, farm and construction equipment (e.g., bulldozers), industrial equipment (e.g., forklifts), and utility equipment (e.g., lawn mowers).  The authority to develop and implement regulations for off-road mobile sources lies primarily with the U.S. EPA, ARB, and to a lesser extent, with the District.  Similar to on-road vehicles, control methods for off-road sources include emission standards, operational modifications, alternative fuels, and control equipment.

<P><A NAME = "INTRO"><H3><B>INTRODUCTION</B></H3>
<P>This chapter analyzes the potential environmental impacts of the Draft 1997 AQMP.  The chapter is subdivided into the following sections based on area of potential impact: water resources; air quality; hazard (risk of upset/human health); energy; and solid/hazardous waste.
<P>Included for each impact category is a discussion of project-specific impacts, project-specific mitigation (if necessary and available), impacts remaining after mitigation (if any), cumulative impacts, and cumulative impact mitigation (if necessary and available).  Also included within each subsection is a discussion of the potential impacts of the alternatives relative to the proposed project.
<A ID="E9E4" NAME="E9E4"></A>
<P><A NAME = "EIR"><H3><B>ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDED IN THE EIR ANALYSIS</B></H3>
<P>In order to address the full range of potential environmental impacts several assumptions were made for purposes of evaluation.  First, to provide a worst-case analysis, the environmental analysis contained herein assumes that the control measures contained in the AQMP, except for the PM10 BACM SIP measures, apply to the entire District (i.e., the Basin and those portions of the MDAB and the SSAB under the district&#146;s jurisdiction).  The PM10 BACM SIP measures apply to the Basin only.  It should be noted that a discussion of the PM10 BACM Maintenance Plan for the Coachella Valley (see the 1997 AQMP, Chapter 8) is not part of the 1997 AQMP and, therefore, not part of this EIR analysis.  This plan is being developed and presented to the Governing Board at a separate date.
<P>If control equipment which has secondary adverse environmental impacts could be used to comply with a particular control measure, it was assumed that such equipment would be used even if it may not be the most appropriate technology or method of compliance.  This approach was taken for each environmental topic.  In practice, there are typically a number of ways to comply with the requirements of District rules, but only a single type of control equipment will actually be installed.  This approach has the potential to substantially overestimate impacts because only a single type of control equipment will be used
<P>If the analyses in other impact categories are based upon specific assumptions not addressed here, those assumptions are discussed in the respective subchapters.
<P>Every control measure in the 1997 AQMP was evaluated to determine whether or not it has the potential to generate adverse environmental impacts.  Each environmental topic subchapter in Chapter 4 contains a table identifying those control measures that have the potential to generate significant adverse impacts to that environmental topic.  Table 4.0-1 lists the various control measures which have been determined not to have significant adverse impacts on the environment.

<P>As already noted, all control measures in the 1997 AQMP were evaluated to determine whether or not they have the potential to generate significant adverse environmental impacts, including Level I and II contingency measures.  There are several reasons why the control measures in Table 4.0-1 are not expected to generate significant adverse impacts.  First, the primary methods of compliance do not involve control equipment that generate adverse secondary or cross media impacts.  For example, controlling NO<SUB>x</SUB> emissions from small combustion equipment is most likely to be accomplished using equipment maintenance, equipment modification, or low NO<SUB>x</SUB> burners.  Analysis of these control approaches in past District documents has determined that they have no potential for generating adverse secondary impacts.
<P>Other reasons control measures in Table 4.0-1 were determined to have no significant impacts is because they consist primarily of changes in operating practices, are primarily administrative in nature, and were fount to have no adverse impacts.  For example, WST-03 - Emissions Reductions from Waste Burning, will not prohibit waste burning, but is likely to recommend that burning occur during periods less conducive to photochemical pollutant generation, e.g., during the spring or late fall.
<P>A third reason control measures in Table 4.0-1 were determined to be insignificant is that, although they might have the potential to generate minor impacts, these impacts are no greater than what is currently being produced.  For example, WST-04 - Disposal of Materials Containing VOC, is likely to specify procedures to be followed when disposing of VOC-containing materials like wipe cloths, etc.  These materials are already being thrown away, so this control measure does not create solid waste impacts beyond those already occurring.
<P>A fourth reason that control measures in Table 4.0-1 were determined to have no significant adverse impacts is that they do not require changes to existing equipment or structures.,  They might, however, require new equipment to be designed differently in the future.  For example, control measure ATT-05 - Intelligent Vehicle Highway Systems (IVHS), could include traffic signal control systems which could coordinate traffic lights in high volume areas.  Such a system would have minimal, if any, adverse environmental impacts.
<P>The final reason that control measures in Table 4.0-1 were determined to have no potential for significant adverse impacts is that the control measure was developed based upon information from local general plans.  As a result, the control measure is consistent with local general plans within the District&#146;s jurisdiction and would not adversely affect growth, development, population or other similar categories.  Since the measure is based on general plans, it is already included in SCAG&#146;s (and the AQMP&#146;s) growth projections and has, therefore, already been accounted for.
<P>The approach used to estimate adverse impacts from AQMP control measures has the potential to substantially overestimate impacts due to the fact that the Level I and II contingency measures cannot be adopted at this time either because: they are not cost-effective (Health and Safety Code &#167;40922(a)); they are not economically feasible (Public Resources Code &#167;21061.1); they have minimal emissions reduction potential (Health and Safety Code &#167; 40922(b)); they are not feasible due to social impact considerations and cost of their administrative burden (PRC 21061.1); or they have low public acceptability (Health and Safety Code &#167;40922(b)).  These measures are never-the-less worst possible adverse impacts that could result from implementation of the 1997 AQMP.

<P>CEQA Guidelines Section 15125 requires an EIR to include a description of the environmental in the vicinity of the project as it exists before the commencement of the project, from both a local and regional perspective.  Chapter 3 contains existing environmental settings for each environmental topic identified in the Initial Study for the proposed 1997 AQMP or recommended for analysis as a result of input received on the Initial Study during the public review and comment period for the Notice of Preparation.
<P>Information contained in the existing setting was derived from the most current information available.  Literature surveys were conducted, individuals from relevant agencies were interviewed by phone, or contacted through written correspondence.  In some cases, drafts of some sections were sent to individuals who provided information to the District in order to ensure accuracy.  The analysis of potential adverse impacts in Chapter 4 are then compared to the existing setting to determined whether the effects of the 1997 AQMP are significant.

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<P>Pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), this Environmental Impact Report (EIR) has been prepared to address the potential adverse environmental impacts associated with the South Coast Air Quality Management District's 1997 Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP).  As discussed below, the AQMP is the planning document which sets forth policies and measures to achieve federal and state air quality standards in the region.  
<A ID="E10E1" NAME="E10E1"></A><p>
<B>California Environmental Quality Act</B>
<P>The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), Public Resources Code Section 21000 et seq., requires that the potential environmental impacts of proposed projects be evaluated and that feasible methods to reduce or avoid identified significant adverse environmental impacts of these projects be identified.
<P>To fulfill the purpose and intent of CEQA, the SCAQMD is preparing this EIR to address the potential environmental impacts associated with the 1997 revision to the AQMP.  Prior to making a decision on the 1997 AQMP, the lead agency decision makers must review and certify the EIR as providing adequate information on the potential adverse environmental impacts of the AQMP.
<A ID="E11E1" NAME="E11E1"><p>
<B>Notice of Preparation/Initial Study</B>
<P>A Notice of Preparation and Initial Study for the 1997 AQMP EIR (included as Appendix A of this Draft EIR) were distributed to responsible agencies and interested parties for a 30-day review and comment period ending February 29, 1996.  The Initial Study identified potential adverse impacts for the following environmental topics: water; air quality; energy; hazards and solid/hazardous wastes.  The comment period was extended beyond February 29, 1996, to allow the public with additional time to comment.
<P>Twenty-five comment letters were received on the Initial Study during the 30-day public review period.  Some of those comments recommended analyzing a number of topics not originally identified in the Initial Study: plant/animal life; noise; land use; population; transportation; recreation; cultural resources; and economics.  
<P>Many of the comments received on the Initial Study for the 1997 AQMP EIR were based upon control measures contained in the 1994 AQMP.  Since the 1997 AQMP will modify and drop certain control measures contained in the 1994 AQMP, not all of the comments received on the Initial Study are applicable to the proposed project.  Consequently, this Draft EIR does not comprehensively evaluate all of the environmental topics recommended in the comment letters.  Detailed responses to all 25 comments received on the Initial Study are included in Appendix B of this Draft EIR.

<H3><B>SUMMARY CHAPTER 2 - PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND ALTERNATIVES</B></H3>
<P>Implementation of the AQMP's strategies requires a cooperative partnership of governmental agencies at the federal, state, regional and local level.  At the federal level, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is charged with regulation of on-road motor vehicle standards; trains, airplanes, and ships; non-road engines; and off-shore oil development.  The California Air Resources Board (ARB) also oversee on-road vehicle emission standards, fuel specifications, some off-road sources and consumer product standards.  At the regional level, the District is responsible for stationary sources and some mobile sources.  In addition, the District has lead responsibility for the development of the AQMP.  Lastly, at the local level, the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) have a dual role of leader and coordinator.  In their leadership role, they, in cooperation with local jurisdictions and subregional associations, develop strategies for these jurisdictions to implement.  As a coordinator, they facilitate the implementation of these strategies.  
<P>Chapter 2 describes current air pollution control strategies and details the proposed approach for the 1997 revision to the AQMP.  Descriptions of potential alternative approaches for the 1997 AQMP are also included in Chapter 2.
<A ID="E10E2" NAME="E10E2"></A><p>
<B>Current Control Strategy</B>
<P>The AQMP strategy currently being implemented (i.e, 1994 AQMP) includes measures which target stationary, mobile, and indirect sources.  These measures are based on feasible methods of attaining ambient air quality standards.  Such approaches also form the basis of many of the short- and intermediate-term control measures proposed in the 1997 AQMP.
<P>There has been considerable progress made in implementing the 1994 AQMP.  The progress can be measured by the number of control measures that have been adopted as rules since the adoption of the 1994 Plan.  Table ES-1 highlights this progress based on individual control measures adopted.

<B>1997 AQMP Control Strategy</B>
<P>The control strategy in the 1997 AQMP remains essentially the same as that adopted in the 1994 AQMP.  At the time of adoption of the 1994 AQMP, two aspects were considered:  the control measures needed to meet federal CAA requirements for the attainment of the ozone standards, and additional control measures needed to meet the federal PM10 standards.  Because there was no federal requirement at that time to demonstrate PM10 attainment in the 1994 Plan, those additional measures over and above the 1994 California SIP measures were not submitted to the U.S. EPA as a revision to the SIP.  With very few exceptions it has been determined that the basic strategy contained in the 1994 California SIP measures are sufficient to demonstrate attainment of both the ozone and PM10 federal standards.  
<P>The notable changes to the control strategy include:  removal of future indirect source measures (ISRs); less reliance on transportation control measures (TCMs) and on long-term future technologies as allowed under Section 182(e)(5) of the CAA; and, removal of some otherwise infeasible control measures.  
<P>The 1997 AQMP includes 42 stationary source measures (of which one is a further study measure), 28 mobile source measures (of which five are Advanced Transportation Technologies and three are Further Study measures), 8 contingency measures and 16 contingency measures that require further study.  Short- and intermediate-term control measures are proposed to be implemented by the year 2000.  These measures primarily rely on the traditional command-and-control approach facilitated by market incentive programs to implement technological solutions and control methods.  Please refer to Chapter 2 of the AQMP EIR for a complete list and discussion of the 1997 AQMP control measures.
<A ID="E11E3" NAME="E11E3"></A><p>
<B>Stationary Source Controls</B>
<P>Stationary source controls reduce emissions from both point (permitted) sources and area  (generally small and non-permitted) sources.  There are approximately 16,000 facilities with permitted stationary equipment within the Basin.  The stationary sources are grouped into over 130 categories and include coatings and solvents, ozone depleting compounds, petroleum operations, combustion sources, fugitive dust, statewide consumer product and pesticide program controls, and the RECLAIM technology assessment.
<A ID="E11E4" NAME="E11E4"></A><p>
<B>Mobile Source Control Measures (On-Road and Off-Road)</B>
<P>There are approximately 10,000,000 on-road vehicle operating in the Basin.  The 1997 AQMP includes technology- and market-based control measures designed to retire older, high-polluting vehicles, improve the Basin&#146;s highway system, improve clean fuel shuttle systems, and introduce low-NOx engines into the Basin as a more rapid rate.  These measures are designed for implementation by the District, ARB and U.S. EPA.
<P>Off-road mobile sources refer to off-road vehicles and mobile non-vehicular equipment categories such as aircraft, trains, marine vessels, farm and construction equipment, industrial equipment and utility equipment.  These measures are designed for implementation primarily by EPA and ARB.  Most of off-road control measures are revisions from the 1994 AQMP with the exception of one market-based control strategy.
<P>There is one transportation control measure being included in the 1997 AQMP, TCM- 01 - Transportation Improvements.  The 1994 AQMP contained seven indirect source measures (ISRs).  These measures have been deleted from the 1997 AQMP.  The Reduce Emissions and Congestion on Highways (REACH) Task Force has convened since the completion of the 1994 AQMP and is looking for pricing strategies or market-based incentives to achieve the emission reductions predicted with the ISRs with lesser environmental and socioeconomic impacts.
<A ID="E11E5" NAME="E11E5"></A>
<p><B>Contingency Measures (Levels I and II)</B>
<P>In order to achieve the improvement in air quality specified in the AQMP, the control measures must be adopted and implemented within the time frames set forth.  The expected progress in meeting the AQMP attainment goals, is verified through a three-year auditing program referred to as reasonable further progress (RFP).  In the event that the RFP shows that implementation of the AQMP is not providing adequate progress and the interim emission reduction goals have not been met, the District must bring forward measures that are scheduled for later adoption or implementation or implement certain &quot;contingency&quot; control measures.  These measures are control options that could be instituted in additional to the AQMP measures.  
<P>A total of 24 control measures have been identified as contingency measures and categorized into two groups:  Level I and Level II.  Level I measures are actions that can be implemented given existing statutory authority .  Such measures would need to be developed and adopted as rules.  The authority to adopt and implement the Level I measures falls on the District, ARB and EPA.  Level II measures are from the 1994 AQMP and have been determined as having low emission reduction potential with a corresponding high administrative burden, or having low cost-effectiveness.  It has been demonstrated that the federal ambient air quality standards can be attained within the statutory time frames without these measures.
<A ID="E10E4" NAME="E10E4"></A>
<p><B>Project Alternatives</B>
<P>CEQA requires an EIR to describe and evaluate the comparative merits of a range of reasonable alternatives to a proposed project.  Alternatives chosen for analysis should be capable of attaining the basic objectives of the proposed project.  The range of alternatives required in an EIR is governed by the &quot;rule of reason&quot; that the EIR need set forth only those alternatives necessary to permit a reasoned choice.  
<P>The possible alternatives to the proposed 1997 AQMP are limited by the nature of the project.  The CCAA requires the District to reduce pollutants contributing to nonattainment by five percent per year or by the maximum extent feasible.  As such, the proposed 1997 AQMP and all viable project alternatives must comply with this criteria to attain the basic objectives of the project.  
<P>The No Project Alternative (Alternative 1) consists of what would occur if the project was not approved; in this case, not adopting a 1997 AQMP.  The net effect of not adopting the 1997 AQMP would be a continuation of the 1994 AQMP taking into account the most current air quality setting (1995) and updated and refined control measures.
<P>Alternative 2 considers implementation of short- and intermediate-term, as well as advanced control measures that would allow regulated facilities to shift emissions from high ozone formation periods (summer) to low ozone formation periods (winter).  Alternative 2 is based, in part, on preliminary analyses conducted for the District&#146;s proposed Intercredit Trading Program.  
<P>Alternative 3 would require implementing fugitive dust control contingency measures instead of implementing NOx control measures.  The contingency measures are CTY12 - Control Emissions from Paved Roads  - Curb and Gutter/Chemical Stabilization and CTY13 - Further Emission Reductions from Construction and Demolition Activities.
<A ID="E9E3" NAME="E9E3"></A>
<p><B>COMPARISON OF ALTERNATIVES</B>
<P>Tables ES-2 ands ES-3 summarize the comparison of the potential project alternatives relative to the proposed project.  Table ES-2 indicates whether the alternatives result in equivalent, better, or worse air quality than the Draft 1994 AQMP.  Table ES-3 indicates whether the potential impacts of other environmental areas are equivalent to (=), greater than (greater), or less than (less) the potential impacts of the Draft 1994 AQMP.

Water demand increases due to implementation of the AQMP are no longer considered significant since:  (1) southern California is no longer under drought conditions, and (2) the potential water demand is negligible relative to existing demand and is well within estimated supplies.
<P><SUP>b</SUP> Since the analysis of the proposed project assumes implementation of all measures, including the contingency measures, the environmental impacts would be equivalent to those identified for the proposed project.  In actuality, however, it is anticipated that Alternative 3 could have slightly greater water resource impacts.

<a name = "ch3"><H3><B>SUMMARY CHAPTER 3 - EXISTING SETTING</B></H3>
<A ID="E10E5" NAME="E10E5"></A>
<p><B>Water Resources</B>
<P>The State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) and the nine regional water quality control boards (RWQCB) are responsible for protecting surface and groundwater supplies in California, regulating waste disposal, and requiring cleanup of hazardous conditions (California Water &#167;&#167; 13000 - 13999.16).  In particular, the SWRCB establishes water-related policies and approves water quality control plans, which are implemented and enforced by the RWQCBs.  Five RWQCBs have jurisdiction over areas within the boundaries of the south coast air district.  These agencies also regulate discharges to state waters through federal National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits.  Discharges to publicly-owned treatment works (POTW) are regulated through federal pre-treatment requirements enforced by the POTWs.
<P>Pursuant to California's NPDES program, any waste discharger subject to the NPDES program must obtain an NPDES permit from the appropriate RWQCB.  The permits typically include criteria and water quality objectives for a wide range of constituents.  The NPDES program is self-monitoring, requiring periodic effluent sampling.  Permit compliance is assessed monthly by the local RWQCB and any NPDES violations are then categorized and reported to EPA on a quarterly basis.
<P>Total water demand within the south coast air district was approximately 4.22 million acre feet (MAF) or about 1.4 trillion gallons in fiscal year 1995 [One acre foot (AF) is equivalent to 325,800 gallons
<BR> Based on historical water use in the MWD service area, water use in 1990 appears to have been relative high compared to other recent years.]  (July 1994 through June 1995).  About two-thirds of that demand occurred in the service area of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD).  The MWD's service area includes southern Los Angeles County, including the San Gabriel and San Fernando Valleys, all of Orange County, the western portion of Riverside County, and the Chino Basin in southwestern San Bernardino County.  The MWD supplied 1.57 MAF and the LADWP supplied 0.55 MAF in the fiscal year 1995 (Rodrigo, 1996).  The remaining 2.1 MAF was drawn from local water sources by local water districts within the MWD service area.  About 89 percent of water consumed in the MWD region goes to urban uses with the rest going to agriculture (Rodrigo, 1996).  Sixty-six percent of urban water use occurs in the residential sector, with another 17 percent in the commercial and six percent in the industrial sectors.  Remaining water uses include public entities, fire fighting, industrial and manufacturing processes.
<P>Water sources include local ground and surface waters, which supply about one-third of District water demand, and supplemental sources, including the State Water Project and the Los Angeles Aqueduct, which supply the other two-thirds.  Suppliers of supplemental water include the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power.  In 1990, total water use in the District was 3.9 million acre-feet (MAF), or 1.3 trillion gallons.  The major water resource alternative in the District is reclaimed wastewater.  The supply of reclaimed wastewater in 2010 is expected to equal about 20 percent of current water use.
<A ID="E10E6" NAME="E10E6"></A>
<p><B>Air Quality</B>
<P>Over the last decade and a half, there has been significant improvement in air quality in the AQMD&#146;s jurisdiction.  Nevertheless, some air quality standards are still exceeded frequently and by a wide margin.  Of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) established for six criteria pollutants (ozone, lead, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, and fine particulate matter [PM10]), the South Coast Air Basin&#146;s jurisdiction is only in attainment with the state and national sulfur dioxide standards.
<P>The following paragraphs briefly summarize the status of air quality in the AQMD&#146;s jurisdiction with respect to monitored levels of the criteria pollutants.
<P>Ozone, carbon monoxide (CO), and PM10 continue to be the area's most severe air pollution problems.  
<P>Unlike primary criteria pollutants that are emitted directly from an emission source, ozone is a secondary pollutant. It is formed in the atmosphere through a photochemical reaction of VOC, oxides of nitrogen (NOx), oxygen, and other hydrocarbon materials with sunlight.  Locations within the AQMD&#146;s jurisdiction exceed the federal ozone standard far more frequently than any other areas in the United States.  Ozone levels in the AQMD&#146;s jurisdiction exceeded the federal standard by the widest margin compared to other criteria pollutants, with a maximum concentration that was 217 percent of the standard.  Ozone concentrations exceeded the state standard at all but one monitored locations.
<P>CO is a colorless, odorless gas formed by the incomplete combustion of fuels.  CO competes with oxygen, often replacing it in the blood, thus reducing the blood's ability to transport oxygen to vital organs in the body.  The ambient air quality standard for carbon monoxide is intended to protect persons whose medical condition already compromises their circulatory system's ability to deliver oxygen.  The CO standard was monitored at 22 locations in 1995.  The federal and state 8-hour CO standards were exceeded at three locations.  Source/Receptor Area No. 12, South Central Los Angeles County, reported by far the greatest number of the exceedances of the federal and state CO standards (13 and 15 days, respectively).  
<P>Nitrogen dioxide (NO<SUB>2</SUB>) is a brownish gas that is formed in the atmosphere through a rapid reaction of the colorless gas nitric oxide (NO) with atmospheric oxygen.  NO and NO2 are collectively referred to as NO<SUB>x</SUB>..  Concentrations of NO<SUB>2</SUB> have declined substantially over the period 1976 to 1995.  By 1991, exceedances of the federal standard were limited to one location in Los Angeles County which is the only area in the United States classified as nonattainment for the federal NO<SUB>2</SUB>  standard.  For the first time in 1992, and again in 1993, 1994, and 1995, no location within the AQMD exceeded the federal standard.  1994 was the first year that the state NO<SUB>2</SUB> standard was not exceeded.  The state standard was also met in 1995.  Despite declining NOx emissions over the last decade, further NO<SUB>x</SUB> emissions reductions are necessary because NO<SUB>x</SUB> is a PM10 and ozone precursor.
<P>PM10 is defined as suspended particulate matter 10 microns or less in diameter and includes a complex mixture of man-made and natural substances including sulfates, nitrates, metals, elemental carbon, sea salt, soil, organics and other materials.  In 1995, the federal PM10 standards were exceeded at nine monitoring stations within the AQMD&#146;s jurisdiction, while the more stringent state PM10 standards were exceeded at all 19 monitoring stations which monitor PM10.
<P>Sulfur dioxide (SO<SUB>2</SUB>) is a colorless, pungent gas formed primarily by the combustion of sulfur-containing fossil fuels.  SO<SUB>2</SUB> concentrations have been reduced to levels well below state and federal standards.  Because SO2 is a precursor to sulfate and PM10 formation, further reductions in emissions of SO<SUB>x</SUB> are needed to attain compliance with standards for these other pollutants.  
<P>Sulfates are a group of chemical compounds containing the sulfate group, which is a sulfur atom with four oxygen atoms attached.  Though not exceeded in 1993, the state sulfate standard was exceeded at three locations in 1994 and one location in 1995.  There are no federal standards for sulfate.
<P>Lead concentrations once exceeded the state and federal standards by a wide margin, but have not exceeded state or federal standards at any regular monitoring station since 1982.  Though special monitoring sites immediately downwind of lead sources recorded very localized violations of the state standard in 1994, no violations were recorded at these stations in 1995.
<P>Since deterioration of visibility is one of the most obvious manifestations of air pollution and plays a major role in the public&#146;s perception of air quality, the state of California has adopted a standard for visibility (also called visual range).  Until 1989, the standard was based on visibility estimates made by human observers.  The standard was subsequently changed to require measurement of visual range using instruments that measure light scattering and absorption by suspended particles.
<P>Visual range measurements were recorded at two locations in 1995.  There were 109 days in 1995 which exceeded the state standard at the east San Gabriel Valley monitoring station (out of 312 days of data).  The central San Bernardino Valley station recorded 50 days exceeding the state standard in 1995 (out of 116 days of data).
<A ID="E10E7" NAME="E10E7"></A>
<p><B>Energy</B>
<P>There are a variety of commercial, residential, and industrial end-users of electricity in the district.  Electricity is used for lighting, space cooling, refrigeration, water heating, and food preparation in a variety of commercial facilities and residential homes. Electricity demand has increased in all sectors of California's economy, but the rate of growth is lower today compared to the increases of the 1950s and 1960s.  Growth rates were typically 7 percent per year in those years.  From 1977 to 1993, electricity demand increased at 2.3 percent per year on average.
<P>Natural gas is a fossil fuel widely used by stationary sources in the district.  It is consumed by end-users in the residential, commercial, and industrial sectors.  Its use is also increasing in the transportation sector. The transportation sector is beginning to use compress natural gas (CNG) as an alternative clean motor vehicle fuel (see the Alternative Transportation Fuels sub-section) in Subchapter 3.3.  Natural gas supplies projections illustrate that supplies will be available for the district well into the year 2010.
<P>The majority of stationary source combustion equipment in the district uses natural gas as the primary combustion fuel.  In-state production accounts for about one half of the petroleum processed by California refineries.  While oil production has been declining in recent years, it has been more resilient on a per well basis than the general United States production trends. California oil production per well has remained between 20 and 25 barrels per day per well, while the United States average has declined from 17 to 12 barrels per day per well since 1975.
<P>California is a major producer of gasoline products.  A total of 13 refineries currently operate in the state and produce the vast majority of gasoline used in California.  California&#146;s demand for gasoline has increased steadily since 1982 when crude oil and product prices began their fall.
<P>There are two basic approaches to the commercialization of clean fuels:  (1) reformulating conventional petroleum based fuels by lowering the content of air pollution precursors and toxic compounds (such as aromatics, benzene, and sulfur); and (2) substituting inherently cleaner-burning alternative fuels such as methanol, ethanol, natural gas, LPG (propane, butane, etc.), and electricity.
<P>Reformulated gasoline (RFG) is a cleaner burning fuel than conventional gasoline that will significantly improve air quality by reducing emissions from all gasoline-burning motor vehicles and engines.  RFG is required by the federal Clean Air Act Amendments and CARB regulations, and is considered a cost effective method to help achieve state and national air quality standards.
<A ID="E10E8" NAME="E10E8"></A>
<p><B>Hazards</B>
<P>Potential risk of upset is a factor in the production, use, storage, and transportation of hazardous materials. The term &quot;hazardous material&quot; is defined in different ways for different regulatory programs.  For the purposes of this EIR, the term &quot;hazardous materials&quot; refers to both hazardous materials and hazardous wastes.  Hazardous materials may be found at industrial production and processing facilities.  Examples of hazardous materials used on a consumable basis include petroleum, solvents, and coatings.  Hazardous materials are stored at facilities producing such materials and at facilities where hazardous materials are part of the production processes.  Specifically, storage refers to the bulk handling of hazardous materials before and after they are transported to the general geographical area of use.  Currently, hazardous materials are transported throughout the air district in great quantities via all modes of transportation including rail, highway, water, air and pipeline.
<P>Hazard concerns are related to the risks of explosions or the release of hazardous substances or exposure to air toxics or electromagnetic fields.  State law requires detailed planning to ensure that hazardous materials are properly handled, used, stored, and disposed of to prevent or mitigate injury to health or the environment in the event that such materials are accidentally released.  Federal laws, such as the Emergency Planning and Community-Right-to-Know Act of 1986 (also known as Title III of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act or SARA) impose similar requirements.  These requirements are enforced by the California Office of Emergency Services.  
<P>Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino, and Orange counties together account for 47 percent of the total hazardous incidents reported in the state.  There were 1,182 reported incidents in 1991 involving such things as explosions, freight truck accidents carrying hazardous materials, exposure to acetone, etc.
<A ID="E10E9" NAME="E10E9"></A>
<p><B>Solid/Hazardous Waste</B>
<P>California Code of Regulations (CCR) Title 14, Division 7 provides the state&#146;s standards for the management of facilities that handle and/or dispose of solid waste.  CCR Title 14, Division 7 is administered by the California Integrated Waste Management Board (CIWMB) and the designated Local Enforcement Agency (LEA).  The designated LEA for the County is the County Department of Environmental Health.  CCR Title 14, Division 7 establishes general standards to provide required levels of performance for facilities that handle and/or dispose of solid waste.  Other requirements included in CCR Title 14, include operational plans, closure plans, and postclosure monitoring and maintenance plans.  This regulation covers various solid waste facilities including, but not limited to:  landfills, materials recovery facilities (MRFs) and transfer stations and composting facilities.
<P>The south coast air district's four-county region is permitted to accept over 100,000 tons of municipal solid waste (MSW) each day.  Solid wastes consist of residential wastes (trash and garbage produced by households), construction wastes, commercial and industrial wastes, home appliances and abandoned vehicles, and sludge residues (waste remaining at the end of the sewage treatment process).  
<P>A total of 32 Class III active landfills and two transformation facilities are located within the south coast air district with a total capacity of 111,198 tons per day.  Los Angeles County has 14 active landfills with a permitted capacity of over 58,000 tons per day.  San Bernardino County has nine public and private landfills within the District&#146;s boundaries with a combined permitted capacity of 11,783 tons per day. Riverside County has 12 active sanitary landfills with a total capacity of 14,707 tons per day.  Each of these landfills is located within the unincorporated area of the county and is classified as Class III.  Orange County currently has four active Class III landfills with a permitted capacity of over 25,000 tons per day.

<H3><B>SUMMARY CHAPTER 4 - POTENTIAL IMPACTS AND RECOMMENDED MITIGATION MEASURES </B></H3>
<P>The following subsections provide a brief discussion of the potential environmental impacts and mitigation measures for each environmental category analyzed.
<A ID="E10E10" NAME="E10E10"></A>
<p><B>Water </B>
<P>Subchapter 4.1 - Water Resources, identifies potential water resource impacts that may result from implementation of the 1997 AQMP.  The impacts analysis is divided into two major categories - water quality and water demand.  
<P>The analysis identifies reformulated low-VOC content solvents and coatings, chemical dust suppression, alternative transportation fuels and add-on control equipment as potential sources of adverse water quality impacts.  Dust suppression, tree planting, and reformulated low-VOC content materials have been identified as potential sources of adverse water demand impacts.  
<P>The analysis determined that, after mitigation, only solvent reformulation (i.e., the reformulation of petroleum-based solvents to aqueous cleaners) may result in significance adverse water resource impacts.
<P>As with current petroleum-based solvent cleaning operations, illegal disposal of spent reformulated cleaning materials could result in significant adverse water quality impacts.  Potential adverse wastewater impacts associated with reformulated solvents are expected to be minimal since: 1) proper disposal would preclude adverse impacts, 2) &quot;cradle-to-grave&quot; contract services are available for users of aqueous cleaners, (3) some solvent cleaning operators may be currently disposing of spent cleaning materials illegally, and (4) the amount of wastewater which may be generated from reformulated solvents is well within the projected receiving capacity of the publicly-owned treatment works (POTWs) in the District&#146;s jurisdiction.
<P>Because reformulation of solvents may result in increased discharge of wastewater exceeding regulatory limits, however, potential water quality impacts from this source is considered significant.
<P>It should be noted that the 1997 AQMP&#146;s primary control approach for the coating and solvent category is command and control regulations with additional compliance options provided by the Intercredit Trading Program and/or Air Quality Investment Program (AQIP).  Regulated sources would have the option to: (1) apply prescribed control technology; (2) purchase emission credits in an open market in lieu of controls; or (3) participate in an AQIP which will in turn generate equivalent emission reductions.  Thus, the expected regulatory options for these sources may minimize the potential for impacts from the reformulation of solvents.  Additionally, this EIR includes a mitigation measure which commits the District to coordinate with appropriate water quality agencies in a public outreach and education program regarding the proper use and disposal of reformulated materials.
<A ID="E10E11" NAME="E10E11"></A>
<p><B>Air Quality</B>
<P>The analysis of potential air quality impacts is organized as follows:  current and future emission inventories are given to illustrate air quality trends that would occur if no additional air pollution control regulations are adopted.  This analysis takes into account future population projections.
<P>Secondary air quality impacts are then discussed.  The air quality analysis evaluates secondary pollutant emissions that could occur as an indirect effect from efforts to improve air quality.  Examples of secondary air quality impacts include emissions from control equipment such as afterburners, potential additional emission from electric power generating equipment because of projected increases in demand for electricity, etc.  Every control measure in the 1997 AQMP was evaluated for potential effects on air quality, grouped together into categories (i.e. coating and solvent reformulations, transportation measures, dust suppression, etc), and then evaluated for their potential to create significant adverse air quality impacts.  To determine whether air quality impacts from adopting and implementing the AQMP as a whole are significant, impacts are evaluated and compared to significance criteria (see Chapter 4.2).
<P>The analysis of secondary air quality impacts indicated that no potential exists for significant air quality impacts.  Consequently, no proposed mitigation measures are necessary.  Global warming and ozone depletion, intercredit trading and area source credits are also evaluated for potential secondary impacts from those programs.  The analysis indicates that significant secondary air quality impacts could result from implementation of an area source credit program.  
<P>The potentially significant air quality impacts from an area source credit program would be due to the requirement by state law (Senate Bill 1098) to issue area source credits for any applicable emission reduction that occurred since January 1, 1991.  This retroactive credit requirement could introduce a significant quantity of emissions back into the system that have not been accounted for in planning inventories.  While such credits would have a finite life (dependent on the average life of the equipment achieving the reductions), the impact may be significant.  As additional data is obtained on this potential effect, the significance determination for this conclusion will be revisited.  Also, this potential effect will be further analyzed in the CEQA document prepared for the rule which would be proposed to implement the control measure.
<P>The objective of the 1997 AQMP is to attain and maintain all state and federal ambient air quality standards.  Based upon the modeling analyses described in chapter 4.2 of this document, implementation of all control measures contained in the 1997 AQMP is anticipated to bring the District into compliance with state and federal standards for all pollutants, except state ozone and PM10 standards, by the year 2010.  Thus, potential cumulative air quality effects of the proposed control measures are not considered significant.
<A ID="E10E12" NAME="E10E12"></A>
<p><B>Hazards</B>
<P>Three areas of potential hazards have been identified:  accidental release of potentially hazardous materials, exposure to toxics from certain reformulated coatings, and exposure to electromagnetic fields.  These impacts may result from the reformulation of many products and the electrification of many mobile sources 
<P>Mitigation measures for potential risk of upset impacts include the following:  performing a screening analysis to determine the maximum daily quantity of coating which can be used without exceeding the appropriate hazard index; require the use of reformulated products which do not contain glycol ethers or employ glycol ethers with lower or no toxicity, where feasible; the use of an optional averaging provision to help companies comply with the proposed lower VOC limits; conduct safety reviews of coatings containing potentially hazardous materials; electric transmission line easements only allowed  in open areas, recreation, utilities, drainage structures, parking and roadway uses; and, no permanent habitable structures should be located within electric transmission line easements.
<P>Overall, potential hazards impacts of the 1997 AQMP were determined to be significant.
<A ID="E10E13" NAME="E10E13"></A>
<p><B>Energy</B>
<P>Potential energy impacts as a result of implementing stationary and mobile control measures in the 1997 AQMP were analyzed and have been found to be not significant on either a project-specific or cumulative basis.  This determination was the result of a conservative analysis that compared projected energy impacts associated with the implementation of the 1997 AQMP to future energy demand baselines.
<P>For stationary sources, a slight but not significant increase in energy demand is expected from the use of add-on air pollution controls (i.e., carbon adsorbers, scrubbers, afterburners, thermal incinerators, baghouses, etc.) associated with control measures for coating operations, solvent cleaning operations, wood working operations, refinery process heaters, and charbroilers at restaurants.  Energy savings are expected from energy conservation and control measures which encourage the use of light colored roof and tree planting programs.
<P>For mobile sources, the shifting of cars, trucks, buses, trains, and off-road vehicles from conventional fuels (i.e., gasoline and diesel) to reformulated gasoline and other alternative clean fuels may slightly increase the district's energy demand.  Once again, this slight increase is not considered significant.
<P>The introduction of alternative fuels into California's transportation energy market continues at a gradual pace, but could be limited by a variety of market and regulatory uncertainties.  Continuing progress in reducing new gasoline vehicle emissions is having an important effect on auto industry development and marketing of alternative fuel vehicles.  The use of cleaner-burning alternative fuels such as CNG and M85 is not receiving as much emphasis in light-duty vehicle emission-reducing strategies as previously expected.  The combination of gasoline reformulation and advances in automotive emission control technology appears to be making the exhaust emission levels required by California's low-emission vehicle standards achievable without relying on the use of alternative fuels.
<A ID="E10E14" NAME="E10E14"></A>
<p><B>Solid Waste</B>
<P>Potential solid waste impacts as a result of implementing the 1997 AQMP have been analyzed and have been found to be not significant, either on a project-specific or cumulative basis.  The criteria used to determine significance included the following:  breach of published national, state, or local standards relating to solid waste or litter control; and, the generation and disposal of nonhazardous or hazardous waste exceeding the capacity of designated landfills.
<P>Air pollution control equipment, early retirement of light- or heavy-duty vehicles, illegal disposal of spent batteries and PM10-related measures were analyzed for potential solid waste impacts.  PM10 measures, air pollution control equipment and the illegal disposal of spent batteries were analyzed in the 1997 AQMP and found to be insignificant.  There are no new PM10 measures being added in this amendment, fewer potential air pollution control technologies and no significant impacts identified from the retirement of older vehicles.  Solid waste impacts, therefore, remain insignificant with mitigation.

<A ID="E10E15" NAME="E10E15"></A>
<p><B>Relationship Between Short-term Uses and Long-term Productivity</B>
<P>Implementing the 1997 AQMP is not expected to gain advantage for local short-term uses at the expense of long-term environmental productivity.  The purpose of the 1997 revision of the AQMP is to set forth a comprehensive control program that will lead the District into compliance with all federal and state air quality standards.  By attaining federal and state air quality standards, the AQMP is expected to enhance long-term productivity in the region.  Some of the means of attaining these standards, such as increasing the efficiency of transportation systems, will also increase long-term productivity.
<A ID="E10E16" NAME="E10E16"></A>
<p><B>Significant Irreversible Environmental Changes</B>
<P>Implementation of the 1997 AQMP is not anticipated to result in any significant adverse irreversible environmental changes.  The AQMP would place only an incremental demand on nonrenewable and limited resources, such as energy and water supplies, relative to the accelerated rate of use of these resources due to population growth and increased consumerism.  The largely irretrievable conversion of undeveloped/agricultural land to urban uses is also a function of the growing population, not the 1994 AQMP.  Finally, the project does not have the capacity to result in adverse irreversible environmental changes as a result of accidents.
<A ID="E10E17" NAME="E10E17"></A>
<p><B>Growth-inducing Impacts</B>
<P>Growth-inducing impacts can generally be characterized in three ways:  1) a project includes sufficient urban infrastructure to result in development pressure being placed on less developed adjacent land; 2) a large project affects the surrounding community by producing a &quot;multiplier effect,&quot; which results in additional community growth; and 3) a new type of development is allowed in an area, which subsequently establishes a precedent for additional development of a similar character.
<P>None of the above scenarios characterize the project in question.

<P><P> <B><A NAME="introduction">INTRODUCTION</B>
<P>The draft 1997 AQMP is designed to satisfy:  
1) the State Implementation Plan (SIP) requirements under Title I of the Clean Air Act (CAA) and 2) Plan requirements of the California Clean Air Act (CCAA).  The emphasis of this Plan is to meet federal CAA requirements for PM<SUB>10</SUB> that are due by February 8, 1997 and to meet CCAA requirements to prepare a comprehensive plan update by December 31, 1997.  In addition, based on new technical information, previous SIP submittals such as the 1994 California Ozone SIP and the Carbon Monoxide SIP are updated as part of this Plan.
<P>The District has authority over the South Coast Air Basin (Basin) and this Plan satisfies the PM<SUB>10</SUB> attainment demonstration requirements of the federal CAA, which is classified as a serious nonattainment area for PM<SUB>10</SUB>.  In addition, the District has jurisdiction over the Coachella Valley located in the Salton Sea Air Basin and the Los Angeles County portion of the Mojave Desert Air Basin.  The Coachella Valley is also designated as a serious nonattainment area for PM<SUB>10</SUB>.  A separate Coachella Valley Maintenance Plan will be submitted to meet federal CAA requirements for this area (see Chapter 8).  The Los Angeles County portion of the Mojave Desert Air Basin, known as the Antelope Valley, is currently unclassified for PM<SUB>10</SUB> and there are no state or federal PM<SUB>10</SUB> planning requirements.
<P>The 1994 AQMP satisfied the ozone attainment and VOC rate-of-progress demonstration requirements of the CAA for the South Coast Air Basin, Antelope Valley, and Coachella Valley.  The 1994 AQMP addressed the separate ozone attainment and VOC rate-of-progress demonstrations for each of these areas.  Based on the control strategy provided in Chapter 4, ozone attainment and rate-of-progress demonstrations are presented in this chapter for the South Coast Air Basin and in Chapter 8 for the Antelope Valley and Coachella Valley.
<P> <B><A NAME="Federal Clean Air">FEDERAL CLEAN AIR ACT REQUIREMENTS</B>
<p><B>PM</B><SUB>10</SUB><B> Planning Requirements</B>

<P>Results of ambient air quality monitoring data indicate that the Basin exceeds federal and state standards for PM<SUB>10</SUB>.  These microscopically fine particles can originate from several industrial processes, including direct emission and atmospheric chemical reactions which convert gases into particles (referred to as &quot;secondary&quot; particulates), and from a variety of fugitive dust sources, both natural and man-made.  In the western portions of the Basin, secondary particulates account for about 45 percent of the annual average PM<SUB>10</SUB>, while soil dust (referred to as &quot;fugitive dust&quot;) accounts for about 30 percent.  In the eastern portion of the Basin, the contributions from secondary particulates and fugitive dust are approximately 40 percent each.  Mobile sources also contribute directly to ambient PM<SUB>10</SUB> levels through tailpipe emissions and, indirectly, through resuspension of paved road dust.
<P>Under the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments the South Coast Air Basin was originally classified as a &quot;moderate&quot; PM<SUB>10</SUB> nonattainment area.  In response to State Implementation Plan (SIP) submittal requirements of the CAA for &quot;moderate&quot; areas, the District submitted applicable portions of the 1991 AQMP to the U.S. EPA prior to the November 15, 1991 statutory deadline.  In accordance with the CAA requirements for moderate PM<SUB>10</SUB> nonattainment areas, the moderate area PM<SUB>10</SUB> SIP submittal proposed the implementation of &quot;reasonably available control measures&quot; (RACM) for fugitive dust sources, and relied upon the AQMP for reductions in precursor gaseous emissions as part of the ozone attainment plan.  Modeling contained in the moderate area PM<SUB>10</SUB> SIP demonstrated that the Basin would not attain the PM<SUB>10</SUB> standards by December 1994 and would subsequently be reclassified as a &quot;serious&quot; nonattainment area.  In February 1993, EPA reclassified the Basin from a &quot;moderate&quot; to a &quot;serious&quot; nonattainment area for PM<SUB>10</SUB>.  The moderate area SIP further showed that the complexity of the problem was of sufficient magnitude that the PM<SUB>10</SUB> standards could not be attained by 2001 -- the deadline for serious nonattainment areas.  The CAA provides a maximum five year extension to the attainment date for those areas that cannot meet the 2001 date after all best available control measures (BACM) have been implemented by 1997; thus making 2006 the latest attainment year possible.  The District has shown in the 1994 AQMP that it will need until 2006 to meet the federal PM<SUB>10</SUB> standards.  
<P>CAA Section 189(b)(2) requires areas reclassified as serious to submit a SIP revision within 18 months of a reclassification.  For the Basin, the PM<SUB>10</SUB> BACM SIP, submitted as part of the 1994 AQMP, met this requirement.
<P><B><U>Current PM</U></B><U><SUB>10</U></SUB><B><U> Requirements</U></B>
<P>For areas such as the Basin that are classified as serious nonattainment for PM<SUB>10</SUB>, Section 189(b)(3) defines major PM<SUB>10</SUB> sources that would be subject to CAA major source requirements.  Sections 189(e) and 189(b)(1)(B) of the CAA require the implementation of &quot;best available control technology&quot; (BACT) for point sources of PM<SUB>10</SUB> and precursor emissions (i.e., precursors of secondary particulates) and BACM for area sources of fugitive dust by February 8, 1997.  U.S. EPA guidance [U.S. EPA,  State Implementation Plans for Serious PM-10 Nonattainment Areas, and Attainment Date Waivers for PM10 Nonattainment Areas Generally; Addendum to the General Preamble for the Implementation of Title I of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 , Federal Register, pp. 41998-42017, August 16, 1994.]  also states that, in instances where mobile sources contribute significantly to the area's exceedance of federal PM<SUB>10</SUB> standards, transportation control measures (TCMs) are also to be included as part of the PM<SUB>10</SUB> SIP submittal.  An attainment demonstration for PM<SUB>10</SUB> is required by the CAA as part of the SIP submittal due February 8, 1997.  Section 189(c) requires the establishment of emission reduction milestones.  Lastly, contingency measures for PM<SUB>10</SUB>, in the event of failure to meet emission reduction milestones or achieve attainment, are also required as part of the SIP submittal.
<P> <B><I>Major PM</I></B><SUB>10</SUB><B><I> Source Requirements</I></B>
<P>Section 189(b)(3) of the CAA defines a major source of PM<SUB>10</SUB> as any stationary source that emits or has a potential to emit at least 70 tons per year of PM<SUB>10</SUB>.  These major sources then would be subject to major source requirements contained in the CAA.  District Rule 1302(p) defines major PM<SUB>10</SUB> sources in accordance with the CAA, making them subject to the major source requirements under New Source Review (NSR).
<P><B><I>BACT for Point Sources</I></B>
<P>As mentioned in the 1994 AQMP, BACT for point sources of PM<SUB>10</SUB> and PM<SUB>10</SUB> precursors  is presently addressed through the District&#146;s NSR and RECLAIM programs (District Rules 1303 and 2005).
<P><B><I>BACM for Fugitive Dust Sources</I></B>
<P>For fugitive dust sources, the selection of BACM to be implemented must be based on a combination of technical feasibility, cost-effectiveness, and energy/environmental considerations;  the selected BACM controls must be implemented by February 8, 1997. These candidate BACM are generally similar to the RACM (Reasonably Available Control Measure) strategy adopted in District Rule 403, except that they are elevated to a higher level of stringency. This is consistent with U.S. EPA policy, which states that &quot;... more stringent control measures are needed in cases when the current control requirements will be insufficient to bring a particular area into attainment.&quot; [ U.S. EPA,. State Implementation Plans for Serious PM-10 Nonattainment Areas, and Attainment Date Waivers for PM10 Nonattainment Areas Generally; Addendum to the General Preamble for the Implementation of Title I of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 , Federal Register, pp. 41998-42017, August 16, 1994.]   The District developed a list of candidate BACM as part of the 1994 PM<SUB>10</SUB> BACM SIP submittal.  These measures have been refined and updated for the 1997 AQMP.  The following is a list of candidate BACM that are being considered as part of the 1997 PM<SUB>10</SUB> SIP revision (a complete description of the candidate BACM can be found in Appendix IV, Section 1):

<P>Further Emission Reductions from Fugitive Dust Sources to meet Best Available Control Measures Requirements (RACM to BACM Upgrade)
</TABLE><P>In the 1994 PM<SUB>10</SUB> BACM SIP, the District committed to adopt all identified candidate BACM via rulemaking action by December 31, 1996 and implement these BACM by February 8, 1997.  However, any candidate measure may not be adopted if it is determined prior to September 1996 that such candidate BACM does not meet the technological and cost feasibility criteria for BACM acceptability.  Such criteria are defined in Chapter 4.
<P>To complete the technological and cost feasibility analyses, the District has undertaken the following actions:
<P><OL><LI> Participated in a fast-track emissions inventory update, as indicated in the Emissions Inventory Update Workplan, coordinated through the BACM SIP Working Group.  This effort provided data on missing and incomplete fugitive dust source categories and processes.  In addition, the District supplemented this effort through the PM<SUB>10</SUB> Technical Enhancement Program (PTEP) emission inventory projects.
<LI>The District compiled a revised baseline inventory for the fugitive dust emission sources and completed the revised inventory process, discussed in Chapter 3.
<LI> Based on the revised emissions inventory and other available information, each of the candidate BACM are being evaluated for cost-effectiveness and control efficiency.  The District has completed the BACM technological and cost feasibility analysis prior to July 1996.
<LI>The District has identified those candidate BACM not meeting either the technological or cost feasibility criteria.  Those candidate BACM, described in Chapter 9, are included as PM<SUB>10</SUB> contingency measures.
</OL><P>The results of the initial feasibility and cost-effectiveness analysis are also discussed in Chapter 4.
<P><B><I>Transportation Control Measures</I></B>
<P>Transportation control measures meeting the CAA requirements have been submitted in previous SIPs, including the 1994 California Ozone SIP.  Updated transportation control measures necessary of attainment of the federal PM<SUB>10</SUB> and ozone standards are described in Appendix IV, Section 3.
<P><B><I>PM</I></B><SUB>10</SUB><B><I> Attainment Demonstration</I></B>
<P>Section 189(b)(1)(a) of the CAA requires a PM<SUB>10</SUB> attainment demonstration.  The results of the attainment demonstration are summarized in Chapter 5.  The air quality modeling used for the PM<SUB>10</SUB> attainment demonstration is described in Appendix V.
<P><B><I>Establishing PM</I></B><SUB>10</SUB><B><I> Milestone Targets</I></B>
<P>Section 189(c) of the CAA requires the establishment of PM<SUB>10</SUB> milestone targets.  The future milestone years for PM<SUB>10</SUB> are 2000, 2003, and 2006.  The milestone targets are set based on expected emission reductions in the target years.  The PM<SUB>10</SUB> milestone targets are shown in Table 6-1 and Appendix V.

<P>The federal CAA requires PM<SUB>10</SUB> contingency measures to be implemented in the event of failure to meet milestone emission reduction targets and/or failure to attain the standard by the attainment date in 2006.  The PM<SUB>10</SUB> contingency measures are those BACM measures that have failed either the technical feasibility or cost-effectiveness criteria or both.  For the draft 1997 AQMP, those measures that have failed the criteria based on initial estimates of feasibility and cost-effectiveness are listed in Chapter 9.  In addition to the fugitive dust contingency measures, other contingency measures for ozone serve as contingency for PM<SUB>10</SUB> to reduce VOCs and oxides of nitrogen which are precursors to particulate organics and nitrates.  The full descriptions of each of the PM<SUB>10</SUB> contingency measures are contained in Appendix IV, Section 6.
<P><B>Other Federal Clean Air Act Requirements</B>

<P>This section describes how the draft 1997 AQMP meets the major ozone planning requirements of the federal Clean Air Act (CAA) for the South Coast Air Basin.  The requirements specifically addressed here are:
<P><UL><LI> the post-1996 VOC rate-of-progress requirements,
<LI>the ozone attainment demonstration,
<LI>the contingency measure requirements, and
<LI>the average vehicle occupancy requirement.
</UL><P> <B><U>Post-1996 VOC Rate-of-Progress</U></B>
<P> The reasonable further progress requirements in the CAA are intended to ensure that each ozone nonattainment area provide for sufficient precursor emission reductions to attain the ozone national ambient air quality standard.  More specifically, Section 182(c)(2) requires that each serious and above ozone nonattainment area achieve actual VOC emission reductions of at least three percent per year averaged over each consecutive 3-year period beginning 6 years after enactment of the Act until the area's attainment date (i.e., November 15, 2010 for the South Coast Air Basin).  This is called the &quot;post-1996 rate-of-progress&quot; requirement of the CAA.
<P>According to  Section 182(c)(2)(C), actual oxides of nitrogen (NO<SUB>x</SUB>) emission reductions which occur after 1990 can be used to meet post-1996 VOC emission reduction requirements provided the NO<SUB>x</SUB> reductions satisfy the following criteria.  First, the control strategy used to demonstrate attainment must consist of both VOC and NO<SUB>x</SUB> control measures.  More specifically, the mix of VOC and NO<SUB>x</SUB> emission reductions used to satisfy the post-1996 rate-of-progress requirements of the CAA must be consistent with the controlled VOC and NO<SUB>x</SUB> emission levels used in the modeling demonstration.  And lastly, the combined annual VOC and NO<SUB>x</SUB> reductions must average 3 percent per year.
<P>The post-1996 rate-of-progress demonstration is presented in Appendix V; Figure 6-1 and Table 6-2 summarize the results.  Shown in the figure are the VOC (Figure 6-1a) and NO<SUB>x  </SUB>(Figure 6-1b) emission target levels  and the projected uncontrolled baseline.  Controlled emission levels are not shown since the VOC and NO<SUB>x  </SUB>emission reductions from existing District and ARB rules are sufficient to meet the CAA rate-of-progress requirements.
<P>For the milestone years 1999 and 2002, the baseline VOC emission levels are below the target levels.  Beginning in 2002, the VOC reductions in the baseline are insufficient and NO<SUB>x  </SUB>substitution is necessary and allowed according to Section 182(c)(2)(C) of the CAA.  The proposed reduction rates for milestone years are shown in Table 6-2.  These rates are determined by applying all the creditable VOC reductions at each milestone and providing sufficient NO<SUB>x</SUB> <SUB> </SUB>reductions to satisfy VOC reduction requirements of Section 182(c)(2).  Note that NO<SUB>x  </SUB>substitution is used to satisfy most of the post-1996 rate-of-progress requirements after the year 2002.

<P><B>Ozone Attainment Demonstration</B>
<P>Under the Clean Air Act, air quality modeling is an integral part of the planning process to achieve clean air.  Specifically, Section 182(b)(1)(A) requires that moderate and above ozone nonattainment areas must reduce VOC and NO<SUB>x</SUB> emissions sufficiently to attain the national ambient air quality standard for ozone.  It is not sufficient for extreme ozone nonattainment areas to meet the post-1996 rate-of-progress requirements of the CAA; extreme ozone nonattainment areas, such as the Basin, must also demonstrate attainment by November 15, 2010.  This may result in emission reductions in addition to those required by the reasonable further progress components of the CAA [i.e., Sections 182(b)(1) and 182(c)(2)].  In this Plan, the modeling requirements are met by applying the U.S. EPA-recommended photochemical grid model called the Urban Airshed Model (UAM) [  User's Guide for the Urban Airshed Model ; prepared for the South Coast Air Quality Management District by Systems Applications International; June 18, 1990.]  using U.S. EPA-approved modeling techniques [  Guidance on Urban Airshed Model (UAM) Reporting Requirements for Attainment Demonstration ; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; OAQPS, Research Triangle Park, NC, December 1993; EPA-454/R-93-056.] .

<P> <B><U>Contingency Measures</U></B>
<P>Section 172(c)(9) of the 1990 CAA requires that the plan shall provide for implementation of specific measures in the event an area fails to make reasonable further progress or to attain the applicable standards by the specified dates.  Such measures shall be included in the Plan revision as contingency measures to take effect without further action by the State or the Administrator.  Measures which cannot be fully adopted by the time EPA acts on the Plan will be adopted within one year of EPA approval to satisfy conditional approval requirement of Section 110(k)94).  Section 182(c)(9) refers to contingency measures if the area does not achieve the applicable milestone; these measures are required to be submitted along with the November 15, 1994 ozone attainment demonstration.  The District has already adopted a CO contingency measure, Rule 1504, parking cash-out, which implements existing state law.
<P>Section 187(a)(3) of the 1990 CAA requires that adopted and enforceable contingency measures be included in the carbon monoxide attainment demonstration plan submittal (see Appendix IV). Contingency measures are required for carbon monoxide attainment planning, to be implemented if the area fails to attain the federal standard by the designated attainment date or fails to achieve the specific annual emission reductions necessary for attainment.  A deviation from the forecasted VMT of more than a given percentage triggers implementation of contingency measures to offset either excess VMT or carbon monoxide emissions due to the additional VMT or equivalent emissions.  According to the EPA General Preamble [Section 532(c)(1)], this percentage is three percent for 1997 and subsequent years or other appropriate values.  The cumulative VMT growth cannot be greater than or equal to five percent above the VMT forecast used as the basis of the attainment demonstration.
<P>A list of the contingency measures developed for these CAA requirements is provided in Chapter 9.
<P> <B>Average Vehicle Occupancy Requirements (AVO)</B>

<P>Section 182 (d)(1)(A) of the CAA requires the District to include in the Plan transportation control measures that offset any growth in emissions from growth in vehicle trips and vehicle miles traveled and attain reduction of mobile source emissions.  Such control measures must be developed in accordance with the guidelines listed in Section 108(f) of the CAA.  The programs listed in Section 108(f) of the CAA include, but are not limited to, transit improvement projects, traffic flow improvement projects, the construction of high occupancy vehicle (HOV) facilities and other mobile source emission reduction programs.  Transportation Control Measure - 1, Transportation Improvements included in Appendix IV of the 1997 AQMP, has been developed to meet the requirements of Section 182(d)(1)(A) and 108(f) of the CAA and includes the capital-based and non-capital-based facilities, projects and programs contained in the Regional Mobility Element and programmed through the RTIP process.  As an additional measure of reducing mobile source emissions, Section 182(d)(1)(B) of the CAA allows the implementation of employer-based trip reduction programs that are aimed at improving the average vehicle occupancy (AVO) rates.  As an alternative to trip reduction programs, Section 182(d)(1)(B) also allows the substitution of these programs with alternative programs that achieve equivalent emission reductions.  Rule 2202 - On-Road Motor Vehicle Mitigation Options, adopted in December 1995, was developed to comply with the CAA requirements and was submitted to EPA for approval.
<P> <A NAME="Carbon Monoxide"> <B>CARBON MONOXIDE ATTAINMENT DEMONSTRATION</B>
<P>The South Coast Air Basin is designated as a serious nonattainment area for carbon monoxide (CO) under the federal Clean Air Act and is required to implement emissions reduction measures as &quot;expeditiously as practicable&quot; in order to attain federal carbon monoxide standards by December 31, 2000.  A Federal Attainment Plan for Carbon Monoxide was approved by the District Governing Board on November 12, 1992 and submitted to the U.S. EPA.  The Plan was revised for the 1994 AQMP as discussed in Appendix I-F of the 1994 Plan.  It should be noted that the state 1-hour CO standard was met for the first time in the Basin in 1995, so CO air quality continues to improve.  It is necessary to revise the CO Plan in the 1997 AQMP due to new VMT and emissions data and adjustments to the control strategy.  As discussed in Chapter 5, the modeling results indicate that the state and federal 8-hour CO standards are projected to be met in 2000 through existing District and ARB rules.  The proposed control strategy will get some additional CO air quality improvement.  The revised CO attainment demonstration is contained in Appendix V.
<P><B>1997 NITROGEN DIOXIDE MAINTENANCE PLAN</B>
<P>Under the CAA, an area can be redesignated as attainment if, among other requirements, the U.S. EPA determines that the NAAQS have been attained.  Section 175A of the CAA states that any district that submits a request under Section 107(d) for redesignation of a nonattainment area to attainment must submit a revision of the applicable SIP that demonstrates attainment for at least 10 years after the redesignation.  U.S. EPA guidance states that a determination of compliance with the NAAQS must be based on three complete, consecutive calendar years of quality-assured air quality monitoring data.
<P>Over the past three years (1993 through 1995), ambient nitrogen dioxide measurements in the South Coast Air Basin have shown that annual nitrogen dioxide concentrations are below the federal air quality standard of 0.053 ppm.  As such, based on the ambient nitrogen dioxide measurements and the demonstration shown in Chapter 5 that the Basin will maintain the federal nitrogen dioxide air quality standard with the projected baseline future-year emissions, this Plan serves as the Nitrogen Dioxide Maintenance Plan for the South Coast Air Basin.

<A NAME="California Clean">CALIFORNIA CLEAN AIR ACT REQUIREMENTS</B>
<P>The California Clean Air Act established a number of legal mandates to facilitate achieving health-based state air quality standards at the earliest practicable date.  The following CCAA requirements are addressed in the remainder of this chapter:
<P><OL><LI> Demonstrate the overall effectiveness of the air quality program;
<LI> Reduce nonattainment pollutants at a rate of five percent per year, or include all feasible measures and an expeditious adoption schedule;
<LI> Ensure no net increase in emissions from new or modified stationary sources;
<LI> Achieve an average commuter ridership of 1.5 persons per vehicle by 1999;
<LI> Ensure no net increase in mobile source emissions after 1997;
<LI> Reduce population exposure to severe nonattainment pollutants according to a prescribed schedule;
<LI> Include any other feasible controls that can be implemented, or for which implementation can begin, within 10 years of adoption; and
<LI> Rank control measures by cost-effectiveness.
</OL> <P><B>Plan Effectiveness</B>

<P>The CCAA requires, beginning on December 31, 1994 and every three years thereafter, that the District demonstrate the overall effectiveness of its air quality program [H&amp;SC 40924(b)].  Trends in the following air quality indicators are used to demonstrate the recent (i.e., since 1987) effectiveness of the District's program:
<P><OL><LI> VOC, NO<SUB>x</SUB>, and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions;
<LI> NO<SUB>2</SUB>, CO and ozone exceedance days; and
<LI> NO<SUB>2</SUB>, CO, and ozone population exposure.
</OL><P>Trends in Basin-wide VOC, NO<SUB>x</SUB>, and CO emissions since 1987 are shown in Chapter 3.  Since 1987 VOC, NO<SUB>x</SUB>, and CO emissions have decreased by 29 percent, 6 percent, and 18 percent, respectively, due to current efforts.  These decreases have occurred in spite of strong population growth over the period.
<P>The percent of days exceeding state standards in 1987, 1990, and 1995 for ozone, CO, and PM<SUB>10</SUB> air quality are illustrated in Figure 6-2.  Even over this relatively short time period, it is evident that air quality has improved in the Basin.  
<P>Trends in nitrogen dioxide (NO<SUB>2</SUB>) air quality are not shown in Figure 6-2; however, improvement in that pollutant is also evident in the last six years.  The federal annual NO<SUB>2</SUB> standard was met for the first time in 1992 and the standard has been met every year since.  Since 1993, the South Coast Air Basin has not experienced any exceedances of the state NO<SUB>2</SUB> air quality standard and the region has been redesignated to attainment for the state NO<SUB>2</SUB> air quality standard.  The reader is referred to Appendix II for a more comprehensive discussion of local air quality trends.

<P>Trends in population exposure are shown in Table 6-2.  Population exposure is a particularly good indicator of air quality trends since it takes into account spatial and temporal changes in air quality.  For example, per-capita population exposure reflects the length of time the Basin population is exposed to unhealthful air quality.  Table 6-2 shows the per-capita exposure to ozone, CO, and NO<SUB>2</SUB> for the historical period 1986-88 and for two recent years, 1993 and 1995.  The per-capita levels shown in the table represent average exposure above the state 1-hour standard levels for each pollutant.

<P>The table clearly shows that the per-capita exposure to ozone, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen dioxide has decreased dramatically since the 1986-88 period.  The Basin is  below the state 1-hour NO<SUB>2</SUB> standard, therefore the per-capita exposure to NO<SUB>2</SUB> is zero.  The per-capita exposure to the state 8-hour CO standard is also near zero, since the Basin is, for the most part, in attainment of the standard.  In 1995, the 8-hour CO standard was exceeded in the south-central Los Angeles area and the San Fernando Valley.
<P>In summary, the trends of all the indicators show improved air quality in the South Coast Air Basin over the last five to eight years; the population is being exposed to unhealthful air quality less and less each year.  These air quality improvements are the direct result of AQMP implementation.
<P> <B>Emission Reductions</B>
<P>The ARB has developed &quot;planning inventories&quot; to characterize emissions during periods when air quality standards are exceeded and to serve as the basis for emissions reduction accounting (see Chapter 3).  As shown in Chapter 3, the planning inventories are 2 to 5 percent higher than the comparable annual average emission inventories.  This difference is primarily due to seasonal temperature changes and the corresponding effects on pollutant emissions rates (e.g., higher solvent and gasoline evaporative emissions on hot summer days; more fuel combustion on cold days).
<P>Table 6-3 presents baseline emissions and estimated emission reductions for the reporting years 1997 and 2000.  These estimates are based on the adoption and implementation schedules contained in Chapter 7.  As seen in the table, the proposed control strategy falls short of the CCAA emission reduction goals (i.e., five percent per year for all nonattainment pollutants) for all pollutants for all years even with the implementation of maximum feasible controls and an expeditious adoption schedule.  Nonetheless, the strategy represents the all feasible control measures and an expeditious adoption schedule as permitted under H&amp;S Code 40914.

<P> <B>Transportation Standards</B>

<P> <B><U>Passenger Vehicle Occupancy</U></B>
<P> The CCAA requires extreme nonattainment areas to achieve an average of 1.5 or more persons per vehicle during commute hours by 1999 [H&amp;SC 40920.5(a), H&amp;SC 40920(c)].  Pursuant to Health and Safety Code 40919(f), these legislative requirements can be met by the same process that is used to meet the federal AVO requirements, namely that alternative control approaches can be used to meet the emission reduction targets for AVR.  This requirement was partially satisfied when the District adopted Rule 2202 to replace Rules 1501 and 1501.1, as explained in greater detail earlier in this chapter.  TCM-01 and other measures contained in this AQMP, coupled with Rule 2202, constitute the most feasible strategy that would facilitate the expeditious attainment of this state requirement.
<P><B><U>No Net Increase in Mobile Source Emissions</U></B>
<P>The CCAA requires severe and above nonattainment areas to have no net increase in vehicle emissions after 1997 [H&amp;SC 40920(c)].  The Basin, as an extreme area, is subject to this requirement.  The draft 1997 AQMP contains a comprehensive strategy to reduce emissions that includes:  reducing tailpipe and evaporative emissions through the ARB's motor vehicle program; reducing emissions from vehicles idling on congested roadways through SCAG's facility improvements and enhancements control measures; and reducing the number and length of vehicle trips through transportation control measures.  The on-road mobile source control strategy is described in Chapter 4.  Additional information on the transportation control strategies can be found in Appendix IV.
<P>This strategy results in achieving the no net increase in vehicle emission requirement of the CCAA, as shown in Figure 6-3.  The baseline emissions inventory for on-road mobile sources in 1997 is 505 tons/day of VOC, 659 tons/day of NO<SUB>x</SUB>, and 4482 tons/day of CO.  Through implementation of the mobile source control strategy, on-road mobile-sources are reduced in 2000 to 387 tons/day of VOC, 537 tons/day of NO<SUB>x</SUB>, and 3757 tons/day of CO; and in 2010 to 112 tons/day of VOC, 292 tons/day of NO<SUB>x</SUB>, and 1253 tons/day of CO.
<P> <B><U>Reduce Growth in VMT and Vehicle Trips</U></B>
<P>The CCAA requires serious and above nonattainment areas to substantially reduce the rate of growth in passenger vehicle trips (VT) and vehicle miles traveled (VMT) [H&amp;SC 40920(d)].  The proposed transportation control measures, directed at increasing the region's average vehicle ridership, also serve to eliminate vehicle trips and reduce vehicle miles traveled.  By 2010, VMT and VT are projected to increase by 32 and 29 percent, respectively, if no further transportation control measures are implemented.  With the transportation control strategy implemented, VMT and VT are projected to grow by a smaller fraction.  Based on SCAG's Regional Mobility Element, VMT and VT will increase by 24 and 25 percent, respectively, in 2010.  This satisfies the requirement for a substantial reduction in the rate of increase.

<P><B>Population Exposure</B>
 
<P>The CCAA also requires a reduction in overall population exposure to criteria pollutants.  Specifically, exposure to severe nonattainment pollutants above standards must be reduced by at least:
<P>(1) 25 percent by December 31, 1994;
<P>(2) 40 percent by December 31, 1997; and
<P>(3) 50 percent by December 31, 2000.
<P>Reductions are to be calculated based on per-capita exposure and the severity of exceedances.  This provision is applicable to ozone, CO and NO<SUB>2</SUB> in the Basin [H&amp;SC 40920(e)].  The definition of exposure is the number of persons exposed to a specific pollutant concentration level above the state standard times the number of hours exposed.  The per-capita exposure is the population exposure (units of pphm-persons-hours) divided by the total population.
<P> <B><U>Methodology</U></B>
<P>For the draft 1997 AQMP, the Regional Human Exposure (REHEX) model is used to estimate per-capita exposure reduction.  It considers population mobility; time spent indoors, outdoors and in transit; exposure by age classification; and activity pattern by season and weekday/weekend.  In addition, REHEX utilizes future-year predicted ozone concentrations from the Urban Airshed Model (UAM) to project population exposure.  The methodology and the model are discussed in more detail in Appendix V of the 1997 AQMP and in Technical Report V-H of the 1991 AQMP.
<P> <B><U>Ozone</U></B>
<P>An analysis using the REHEX model indicates that the CCAA exposure reduction targets will be achieved for ozone with a margin of safety.  Thus, public health will be significantly improved with the implementation of the 1997 AQMP.  Figure 6-4 summarizes the results and compares estimated exposure reductions to the targets.  The exposure reductions shown in 1997 are the actual population exposures in 1995.  Actual exposures in 1995 serve as better indicators of the 1997 exposure than model-predicted estimates.

<CENTER>Percent Reductions in Annual Average Per-Capita Exposure to Ozone</CENTER>
<P>The REHEX model also allows more detailed exposure reduction estimates disaggregated by age group and county.  These results are summarized in Figures 6-5 and 6-6, respectively.  As shown, the greatest exposure reduction for an individual age class is for children, who have longer exposure to outdoor concentrations; the geographic location with the most improvement for all age groups is that comprised of the two inland counties.
<P> <B><U>Carbon Monoxide</U></B>
<P>The REHEX modeling results for CO are shown in Figure 6-7.  As shown, the proposed control strategy will greatly exceed the CCAA reduction requirements for CO exposure.  As discussed in Chapter 5 and in Appendix V, the 1-hour and 8-hour CO standards are projected to be met by the year 2000.  Therefore, the Basin population will not be exposed to unhealthful CO levels and thus per capita exposure is reduced 100 percent from the 1986-88 base levels.  The exposure reductions shown in 1997 are the actual population exposures in 1995 and as discussed earlier the 1-hour CO standard was met for the first time in 1995.

<P>As discussed earlier, the 1-hour NO<SUB>2</SUB> standard was met in 1994 and 1995.  In addition, the NO<SUB>x</SUB>  reductions from existing District and ARB rules assure that the NO<SUB>2</SUB> standards will continue to be met (see Chapter 5).  Therefore, since 1994 and projected into the future the Basin&#146;s population will not be exposed to unhealthful levels of NO<SUB>2</SUB>.  The CCAA exposure goals have been satisfied through the District&#146;s AQMP.
<P> <B>Cost Effectiveness Ranking</B>

<P>The CCAA requires the District Governing Board to determine that the AQMP is a cost-effective strategy that will achieve attainment of the state standards by the earliest practicable date [H&amp;SC 40913(b)].  In addition, the Plan must include an assessment of the cost-effectiveness of available and proposed measures and a list of the measures ranked from the least cost-effective to the most cost-effective [H&amp;SC 40922].
<P>Table 6-5 and Table 6-6 provide a listing of the short- and intermediate-term measures that have available cost information for stationary and mobile source measures, respectively.  The cost-effectiveness <U>for stationary source measures</U> range from <S>about</S> under $100 to as high as $12,300 per ton of pollutant reduced.  The proposed implementation schedule for these measures is provided in Chapter 7 and is based on this information and other relevant factors.

<P><A NAME="intro"></A><H3>INTRODUCTION</H3>
<P>The overall control strategy in the AQMP provides the path to achieving emission reductions and air quality goals.  Implementation of the draft 1997 AQMP is based on a series of control measures that vary by source type, such as stationary or mobile, as well as by the pollutant that is being targeted.  Although great strides have been made in air pollution control technologies, air quality goals cannot be achieved without significant further advancements.
<P>This chapter discusses the control measures for the draft 1997 AQMP and associated emission reductions.  Where appropriate, information regarding the differences between the 1994 AQMP and the draft 1997 AQMP are identified.  For additional information and details on control measures please refer to Appendix IV.  For additional information regarding baseline emission projections and estimated reductions, please refer to Appendix III.
<P><A NAME="over_att"></A><H3>OVERALL ATTAINMENT STRATEGY</H3>
<P>The overall control strategy for this Plan is designed to meet applicable state and federal requirements, including attainment with ambient air quality standards.  Similar to the 1994 AQMP, the draft 1997 AQMP proposes two tiers of emission reduction measures, based on availability and readiness of technology.  
<P>Short- and intermediate-term measures propose the application of available technologies and management practices between 1997 and the year 2005.  These measures rely on known technologies and proposed actions to be taken by several agencies that currently have the statutory authority to implement such measures.  These measures are designed to satisfy the federal Clean Air Act requirement of reasonably available control technologies [Section 172(c)], and the California Clean Air Act requirements of Best Available Retrofit Control Technologies (BARCT) [Health and Safety Code Section 40919, Subsection C].  
<P>To ultimately achieve ambient air quality standards, additional emissions reductions will be necessary beyond the implementation of short- and intermediate-term measures.  Long-term measures rely on the advancement of technologies and control methods that can reasonably be expected to occur between 2000 and 2010.  These long-term measures rely on further development and refinement of known low- and zero-emission control technologies in addition to technological breakthroughs.  

<p><h4>Designing the Overall Strategy</h4>

<P>To develop the control strategy required in the Plan to meet state and federal requirements, an iterative process of technology review and ambient air quality modeling is utilized.  Specifically, a remaining emissions target is defined utilizing air quality modeling that will achieve the ambient air quality standards.  Technological assessments are then performed to determine if specific technological advancements can be expected to result in meeting this remaining emissions target.  Further modeling analyses are conducted using the actual emissions reductions achieved based on the technology review process.  Ultimately an overall emissions target is determined that achieves the ambient air quality standard and for which controls have been defined.  Figure 4-1 illustrates this iterative process used to define the preferred control strategy.  
<P>The 1994 California Ozone State Implementation Plan (SIP) control strategy serves as the starting point to demonstrate attainment of both federal PM<SUB>10</SUB> and ozone air quality standards.  If necessary, additional controls from the 1994 comprehensive AQMP or other alternative approaches would be added to attain the federal air quality standards.  Furthermore, these additional control measures would be evaluated to determine consistency with potential future air quality standards and ensure the most cost-effective path to meet multiple clean air standards.

<H3><A NAME="siterm"></A>Short- and Intermediate-term Emission Reduction Measures</H3>

<P>The draft 1997 AQMP includes 37 stationary and 24 mobile source control measures.  A summary of these measures is provided below.  A detailed description of the control measures is provided in Appendix IV-A:
<UL>
<LI>Section  I: District&#146;s Stationary Source Control Measures
<LI>Section II*: District's Mobile Source Control Measures
<LI>Section IV: ARB Mobile Source Control Strategy
<LI>Section V: Further Study Measures
<LI>Section VI: Contingency Measures
</UL>
<P>A description of the advanced transportation improvement and advanced transportation technology measures is provided in Appendix IV-B.** <P>
[* Section III has been removed.  Please refer to Appendix IV-B.] <BR> 
[**  This appendix will be made available upon receipt from SCAG.] 
<P>Short- and intermediate-term emission reduction control measures are proposed to be implemented between 1997 and 2005.  These measures primarily rely on the traditional command and control approach facilitated by market incentive programs to implement technological solutions and control methods.
<P><A NAME="sscm"></A><H3>Stationary Source Control Measures</H3>

<P>Stationary controls are proposed to reduce emissions from both point sources (permitted facilities) and area (generally small and non-permitted) sources. 
<P>All but three stationary source control measures were previously contained in the 1994 AQMP or the California Ozone SIP.  One 1994 contingency measure for stationary sources has been placed in the Further Studies category.  Sections I and V of Appendix IV provides detailed descriptions for each of these measures.  In addition, previously subsumed command and control measures for coatings and solvents under the proposed VOC RECLAIM program have now become the primary approach and are updated to reflect the most recent technology assessment and rule implementation schedule.  Three new measures are added in the draft 1997 AQMP: Intercredit Trading Program, Air Quality Investment Program and Promotion of Catalyst-Surface Coating Technology Programs for Air Conditioning Units.  These measures are designed to enhance compliance flexibility, to facilitate the implementation of the command and control measures.  Table 4-1 provides a listing of the short- and intermediate-term stationary source control measures.
<P><B><U>Categorization of Stationary Source Control Measures</U></B>
<P>Stationary source control measures in the draft 1997 AQMP are grouped into 5 subcategories as described below:<OL>
<P>Group 1 Coatings and Solvents
<BR>Group 2 Petroleum Operations, Refueling, and Fugitive VOC Emissions
<BR>Group 3 Combustion Sources
<BR>Group 4 Fugitive Dust and Miscellaneous Source Categories
<BR>Group 5 Compliance Flexibility Programs
</UL>
<P>A detailed description of the control measures in each of the above groups is provided in Section I of Appendix IV.

<P>As previously discussed, short- and intermediate-term measures rely on available control technologies.  The control methods for stationary sources identified in Table 4-2 below rely on a variety of control technologies and management practices.  Control technologies vary according to the source type and pollutant being controlled and generally include a process or physical modification such as product reformulation, installation of air pollution control equipment, etc.  In addition, management modifications include administrative changes such as improved housekeeping techniques, inspection and maintenance programs, etc.

<P>&#149; Investment in Clean Technologies</TABLE></CENTER><P>A variety of innovative implementation approaches are proposed to facilitate and/or compliment the implementation of these measures, such as intercredit trading, public awareness programs, equipment certification, etc.
<P><B><U>Coatings and Solvents</U></B>
<P>Controls for the coatings and solvents category are primarily targeted at reducing VOC emissions.  The primary control approach for this category is command and control regulations with additional compliance options provided by the Intercredit Trading Program and/or Air Quality Investment Program (AQIP).  Regulated sources have the options to: (1) apply prescribed control technology; (2) purchase emission credits in an open market in lieu of controls; or (3) participate in the AQIP which will in turn generate equivalent emission reductions.  The substitution measures provided in the 1994 AQMP for control measure CTS-01 - VOC RECLAIM are now combined with CTS-02 - Control of Emissions from Solvents and Coatings.
<P>In addition, the District is proposing to develop a series of public awareness and education programs for small source categories.  The intent of these programs is to develop a partnership between the District and smaller more diverse businesses to educate sources on alternative products, techniques, processes, and equipment modifications that can be used at their facility to reduce pollution.  Examples of potentially targeted businesses include beauty salons, leather repair shops, and laboratories.
<P>Included in category are two measures that will be implemented by ARB to further reduce emissions from consumer products and by the state Department of Pesticides Regulation (DPR) to control pesticide emissions as originally contained in the 1994 California Ozone SIP.
<P><B><U>Petroleum Operations and Fugitive VOC Emissions</U></B>
<P>This category pertains primarily to operations and materials associated with the petroleum and chemical industries.  Within this category there are three control measures targeting fugitive VOC emissions associated with transfer and storage of organic liquids, wastewater systems, and industrial processes.
<P><B><U>Combustion Sources</U></B>
<P>There are six control measures in this category, two of which are area source credit programs designed primarily to provide compliance flexibility and to incentivize clean technologies. These include commercial and residential equipment and energy conservation strategies.  There is another measure for new commercial and residential water heaters.  In addition, a proposed rule for petroleum refinery flares is being developed to first assess the emission inventory for this source category; another rule is being developed for the control of PM<SUB>10</SUB> emissions from refinery fluid catalytic coaching units (FCCUs); and lastly, a rule is proposed for NO<SUB>x</SUB> reductions from small boilers and process heaters.
<P>In addition, the results of technology review as required by the District RECLAIM Rule 2015 - Backstop Provisions are incorporated in the draft 1997 AQMP.  The purpose of the technology review is to ensure that the facility allocations are based on control methods that are likely to be technologically feasible.  Furthermore, proposed changes in allocation due to further technology assessment are reflected in the draft Plan to account for potential increases in emissions.

<P><B><U>Fugitive Dust and Miscellaneous Sources</U></B>
<P>This category includes a total of 14 control measures.  Ten measures are designed for a variety of sources ranging from service-oriented industries such as restaurants and agricultural activities, to waste-related emissions such as livestock waste, waste burning, and disposal of VOC-containing materials.  An incentive program is proposed to promote the use of lighter color roofing, road materials, or tree planting.  A second incentive program is proposed to promote catalyst surface coating technologies for air conditioning units.  An in-use compliance program is also considered to ensure the performance of air pollution control equipment.  A measure regarding emissions charges for stationary sources as required under federal law is proposed for further study to determine its applicability and feasibility.
<P><B><I>Fugitive Dust Control Measure Cost and Technical Feasibility</I></B>
<P>For the 1994 PM<SUB>10</SUB> Best Available Control Measures (BACM) SIP submittal, five best available control measures were provided to control fugitive dust emissions.  As part of that submittal, the BACM SIP committed to adopt all candidate BACM within four years of the reclassification date (i.e., February 8, 1997) with the exception of any measure that did not meet a specified cost and technological feasibility criteria.  The SIP revision identified the criteria as follows:

<P>(1-1) Cost feasibility:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>A control measure will be considered cost feasible if the cost-effectiveness is less than $5,300 per ton of PM<SUB>10</SUB> reduced on an annual basis.  
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(1-2) Technological feasibility:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>A control measure will be considered technically feasible if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
<BR>(a) The control technology is currently available; and
<BR>(b) The control efficiency has been demonstrated to achieve a minimum of at least 10 percent.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Table 4-3 presents a summary of the preliminary candidate BACM cost and technological feasibility analysis.  As Table 4-3 indicates, BCM 1d/1e (curb and gutter/chemical stabilization) exceeds the cost feasibility criteria.  Table 4-3 also shows that BCM-2 (wider use of plans) does not meet the 10 percent control efficiency criteria.  Additionally, initial studies indicate that emissions from weed abatement activities are insignificant on a regional scale and should be managed on a local level.  Accordingly, BCM-5 (weed abatement) will not be considered as a primary control measure.  These measures are proposed to serve as contingency measures for fugitive dust sources and are presented in Chapter 9 and Appendix IV.  As specified by CAA 172(c)(9), these PM<SUB>10</SUB> contingency measures would only become effective if the Basin fails to make reasonable further progress or attain the NAAQS by the applicable attainment date.

<P>Two control measures are proposed under this category which are new additions to the draft 1997 AQMP as compared to the 1994 AQMP.  The two control measures (Intercredit Trading Program and Air Quality Investment Program) are designed to complement command and control measures.  The primary objectives of the two measures are to enhance regulatory compliance flexibility by providing additional compliance options and thereby lowering compliance costs and to incentivize early reductions and advancement of clean technologies through emission credit banking provisions.  These two measures are essential to the successful introduction of the long-term control measures.
<P><B><U>Ozone Depleting Compounds</U></B>
<P>As a result of worldwide concern over the destruction of the stratospheric ozone layer, the use of certain stratospheric ozone depleting compounds (ODCs) is scheduled to be internationally eliminated under the Montreal Protocol.
<P>ODCs such as 1,1,1-trichloroethane and CFC-113 are currently used in cleaning, precision cleaning, electronics, coatings, adhesives, aerosols, and flexible slabstock foam manufacturing in the Basin.  As part of the adoption of the Federal Reactive Organic Compounds Rate-of-Progress Plan, the District's Governing Board directed staff to consider the impacts on the urban ozone problem from the replacement of ODCs with VOC-containing materials.
<P>In 1992 an ODC Working Group comprised of representatives from the District, ARB, EPA, industry, and other interested parties was established to evaluate the impact of a potential VOC increase resulting from elimination of ODCs.  The ODC Working Group developed substitution estimates based on categories of usage and types of processes.  In January 1996, the District prepared &quot;Ozone Depleting Compounds Replacement Guidelines&quot; to facilitate the transition from ODCs to substances that are the most environmentally benign.  Based on the estimates provided in the guideline document, an additional 11 tons/day of VOC is projected by the year 2010 as compared to the baseline projections discussed in Chapter 3.  An adjustment has been made in the remaining emissions inventory to account for these future year emission increases, which are subject to District review at the time of conversion to comply with the criteria established by the guideline document. 
<H3><A NAME="ormscm"></A>On-Road Mobile Source Control Measures</H3>

<P>On-road motor vehicles, which include passenger cars, light-duty trucks, medium-duty vehicles, heavy-duty vehicles, and motorcycles, currently number approximately 10 million in the South Coast Air Basin.  In 1995, these vehicles traveled more than 300 million miles per day, and by the year 2010, vehicle miles traveled is projected to be about 380 million miles per day.  ARB and U.S. EPA have primary authority to control mobile source emissions through the adoption of emission standards and other related requirements; whereas the District has more limited authority to reduce emissions from these sources.
<P>The draft 1997 AQMP includes seven on-road mobile source control measures.  Two measures are proposed for District implementation, four measures are provided for ARB implementation, and one control measure is proposed for U.S. EPA implementation.  The two District on-road control measures are new to the draft 1997 AQMP, and are voluntary, market-based measures, while the remaining control measures are from the 1994 California Ozone SIP.  Table 4-4 summarizes the on-road vehicle control measures, using traditional command and control as well as market based approaches.

<P><B><U>Technology-Based Control Measures</U></B>
<P>In the past, the control of on-road vehicle emissions was achieved primarily from the adoption of more stringent emission standards.  The most significant action that has taken place in pursuing this approach was the adoption of the Low-Emission Vehicle and Clean Fuels regulations by ARB in September 1990.  This regulation established stringent tailpipe standards and mandated low-emission vehicle sales for the years 1994 through 2003.  This regulation is applicable for passenger cars, light-duty trucks, and medium-duty vehicles, and its principal requirements are summarized as follows:
<UL>
<P><LI> establishes vehicle emission standards that will require additional VOC and NO<SUB>x</SUB> emission reductions of approximately 80 percent and 50 percent, respectively, compared to 1994 emission standards;
<LI> requires the sale of zero-emission vehicles beginning in 2003;  
<LI> allows the use of vehicles powered by alternative fuels; and 
<LI> requires the widespread availability of alternative fuels, based on the number of alternative-fueled vehicles produced by automobile manufacturers.
</UL>
<P>The draft 1997 AQMP, consistent with 1994 AQMP, includes a control measure that proposes ARB adoption of emission standards that are more stringent than existing low-emission vehicle requirements, to continue the progress in reducing passenger car and light-duty truck emissions for the post 2003 timeframe.  This is based on the development of cost-effective gasoline engine control technology, along with anticipated advancements in electric vehicle battery technology and supporting infrastructure.  With regard to medium-duty vehicles, it is proposed that the current requirements applicable for the 1998 to 2002 timeframe be modified by ARB to accelerate the in-use penetration of low-emission vehicles and ultra-low emission medium-duty vehicles.  Again, carryover this proposal from the previous plan is based on assumptions regarding expected advancements in light-duty vehicle emission control technology that would be applicable for the medium-duty vehicle sector.  
<P>With regard to heavy-duty vehicles, the approach for further reducing emissions depends on whether the vehicles are powered with gasoline or diesel fuel.  For gasoline-fueled heavy-duty vehicles, ARB proposes to obtain oxides of nitrogen and VOC emission reductions by lowering emission standards, through the application of emission control technology (i.e., utilization of three-way catalytic converters) that is already well established for light-duty vehicles.  For diesel-powered heavy-duty vehicles, ARB is proposing a combination of strategies in an overall effort to maximize the utilization of very low NO<SUB>x</SUB> emitting engines in California trucking fleets.  These strategies include the adoption by ARB of more stringent NO<SUB>x</SUB> emission standards, effective for the post 2002 timeframe, as well as U.S. EPA adoption of correspondingly stringent nationwide oxides of nitrogen emission standards for the post 2004 timeframe.  U.S. EPA action in this area is particularly important since a significant amount of diesel-fueled heavy-duty vehicles operating in California are powered with federally certified engines.
<P><B><U>Market-Based/Incentive Strategies</U></B>
<P>The 1994 AQMP included a number of market-based control measures that have been adopted in 1995 as District Rules 1612 and 1620.  These include MON-01 - Emissions Reduction Credit for Low-Emission Retrofit Fleet Vehicles, MON-05 - Emissions Reduction Credit for Heavy-Duty Buses, and MON-06 - Emissions Reduction Credit for Heavy-Duty Trucks.  In continuing this approach to reduce mobile source emissions, the draft 1997 AQMP includes several market-based/incentive control measures targeting the light- and heavy-duty vehicle sectors.  With regard to District implementation, it is proposed that mobile source emission reduction credits be issued for certain strategies that will produce emission reductions surplus to existing or planned requirements, such as truck stop electrification and the use of fuel additives.
<P>The draft 1997 AQMP also includes market-based/incentive control measures for ARB implementation.  Specifically, it is proposed that ARB adopt regulations implementing a 75,000 vehicle per year accelerated retirement program for light-duty vehicles beginning in 1999 (Control Measure M1), with a smaller pilot-scale program to be implemented in the 1996 to 1998 timeframe.  The oldest, highest-emitting vehicles would be targeted for this program.  It is also proposed that a similar strategy be implemented for heavy-duty diesel trucks (Control Measure M7), targeting the accelerated retirement of 1,600 vehicles, using the same implementation dates as the light-duty vehicle accelerated retirement program.  Finally, a market incentive rule, to be implemented by ARB and/or the District, is proposed with the objective of accelerating the penetration of low-NO<SUB>x</SUB> heavy-duty engines in local trucking fleets.  This would occur in the 1996 to 2002 timeframe, prior to the implementation of revised oxides of nitrogen emission standards for heavy-duty engines.


<CENTER><H3><A NAME="off_road"></A>Off-Road Mobile Source Control Measures</H3>
</CENTER>
<P>Off-road mobile sources refer to off-road vehicles and mobile non-vehicular equipment categories such as aircraft, trains, marine vessels, farm and construction equipment (e.g., bulldozers), industrial equipment (e.g., forklifts), and utility equipment (e.g., lawn mowers).  The authority to develop and implement regulations for off-road mobile sources lies primarily with the U.S. EPA, ARB, and to a lesser extent with the District.
<P>The draft 1997 AQMP includes a total of eight off-road mobile source control measures.  Six measures are based on U.S. EPA implementation, one measure is provided for ARB implementation, and one control measure is provided for District implementation.  The District control measure is new to the draft 1997 AQMP and is a voluntary market-based measure.  The remaining control measures represent control measures from the 1994 California Ozone SIP and target mandatory emission limits for certain types of off-road equipment categories.  Table 4-4 provides a list of the off-road mobile source measures.
<P>Because of practical and legal considerations, the majority of control measures for off-road mobile sources focus on the U.S. EPA adoption of nationwide emission standards.  Control measures proposing emission standards for new aircraft engines, as well as new and rebuilt and locomotive engines target U.S. EPA or other federal agencies implementation, since the federal government has sole authority over these emission sources.  For the same reason, U.S. EPA implementation is assigned to control measures that propose more stringent emission standards for diesel powered off-road industrial equipment, and gasoline and LPG powered industrial equipment from 25 to 175 horsepower. (It should be noted that industrial equipment can include emission sources that are categorized under the farm and construction equipment category above and below 175 horsepower.  Since U.S. EPA has sole authority for farm and construction equipment below 175 horsepower, separate control measures targeting industrial equipment have been included based on whether implementation would be assigned to ARB or U.S. EPA.)
<P>A control measure proposing nationwide emission standards implemented by U.S. EPA, in conjunction with international standards, is also the most viable approach for reducing marine vessel emissions since many of these vessels are not based in California or the United States.  Finally, nationwide emission standards for pleasure craft are being proposed since manufacturers would have a larger market base to promote the development of emission control technology.  As a backstop strategy, ARB would act to adopt emission standards (where legally permitted) for off-road emission sources if U.S. EPA fails to adopt nationwide standards.
<P>The District&#146;s new market-based control measure proposes the issuance of mobile source emission reduction credits for programs that accelerate the replacement of existing pleasure craft engines with new lower-polluting engines.  These programs would be voluntarily implemented and would provide industry with more flexible and potentially more cost-effective approaches in complying with District emission reduction requirements.  

<A NAME="tcism"></A><H3>Transportation Control Measures</H3>

<P>One transportation control measure (TCM), five advanced transportation technology (ATT) measures, and three further study strategy measures (FSS) have been included in the draft 1997 AQMP and are listed in Table 4-4.
<P>California Health and Safety Code Section 40920.5 establishes three specific transportation performance standards, and dates by which these performance standards must be met.  These standards require a reduction in the increase of passenger vehicle trips and miles traveled, attainment of an average vehicle occupancy (AVO) of 1.5 during weekday commute hours by 1999, and TCMs to ensure no net increase in vehicle emissions after 1997.  Analogous requirements also exist in the federal Clean Air Act.  However, recent federal and state legislation provides for alternative control approaches which can achieve equivalent emission reductions to the AVO-based programs to be developed in place of commuter rideshare programs.  District Rule 2202 was adopted in December 1995 to provide the mechanism for employers of 100 employees or more to achieve targeted emission reductions through a menu of control options approach.  The draft 1997 AQMP is designed to achieve equivalent emission reductions after Rule 2202 sunsets in 1998.
<P><B><U>Control Measure Development</U></B>
<P>Several policy committees as well as local governments submitted recommendations to SCAG and the District regarding control measure development and implementation for the 1994 AQMP.  These included:  the TCM Policy Committee; Advanced Transportation Technology (ATT) Task Force; Market Incentives Task Force; Regional Railroad Air Quality Emission Reduction Board; and Subregional Organizations.  In addition, the SCAG Regional Council recommended that the proposed transportation control measures be included as part of the 1994 AQMP.  These measures and recommendations have been moved forward and included in the 1997 AQMP.
<P><B><U>Control Method Objectives</U></B>
<P>The status of the objectives for the implementation of the 1994 AQMP developed by the Transportation Committees and Task Forces are as follows: a delegation and substitution process, to allow delegation for implementation of regional indirect source rules and/or substitution of local implementation plans or measures for requirements of AQMD rules, has been developed and approved by the Governing Board; however, since future ISRs, have not been incorporated in the 1997 AQMP, the delegation substitution process relative to these rules is also not incorporated in this Plan.  The Partnership to accelerate implementation of advanced transportation technologies has been implemented and is proceeding with the implementation of the ATTs included in the 1994 AQMP; and the REACH Task Force has been convened and is in the process of developing market-based solutions to regional transportation and air quality problems.  The current proposal from the REACH Task Force is included in the draft 1997 AQMP as a further study strategy measure.  In addition, a &quot;Clean Air Community&quot; Program is proposed for further study.
<P><B><U>Control Methods</U></B>
<P>A list of control methods for transportation control measures is summarized in Table 4-5.  As shown below, control methods are categorized into three groupings:  advanced transportation technologies, transportation improvements, and a further study strategy.

<P>Short and intermediate-term control measures potentially available for implementation by 2005 were identified and to the extent possible quantified.  These quantified measures were modeled to determine their effectiveness in meeting the attainment goals.  For stationary point sources, measures were quantified for equipment and industry categories which are more detailed than quantifying measures based in large part on equipment categories.  Appendix III provides a more detailed discussion of the emissions inventories for the South Coast Air Basin, and emission estimation techniques used for quantifying reductions for the draft 1997 AQMP.

<P><A NAME="long_term"></A><H3>LONG-TERM EMISSION REDUCTION MEASURES</H3>
<P>Previous AQMPs showed that achievement of ambient air quality standards will require additional emission reductions beyond the implementation of short- and intermediate-term control measures.  Historically, the AQMP has emphasized and relied upon the continual need to deploy advanced air pollution control technologies and cleaner fuels to ultimately achieve air quality goals.  In the 1994 AQMP, emissions reduction targets were established for the remaining emissions after implementation of short- and intermediate-term controls.  These targets, referred to as long-term or Section 182(e)(5) control measures, were based on the application of advanced technologies and additional market incentives and operational measures. The draft 1997 AQMP reached similar conclusions and proposed to further reduce emissions through measures that are based on specific technological advancements and control methods that can be reasonably expected to be implemented and in use by the year 2010.  These technologies and control methods cannot be fully implemented today; however, recent promising advancements suggest that such technologies could be commercially viable and implemented over the next 13 years.

<H3><A NAME="sec182"></A>Section 182(e)(5) Control Measures</H3>

<P>Section 182(e)(5) of the federal Clean Air Act allows extreme ozone nonattainment areas to develop control measures which rely on anticipated development of new control techniques or improvement of existing control technologies.  An enforceable commitment to develop and adopt contingency measures, to be implemented should the proposed control measures fail to meet stated emission reductions, must be made.  Contingency measures for the Section 182(e)(5) measures must be submitted to the U.S. EPA no later than three years before proposed implementation of the Section 182(e)(5) measures.
<P>Many of the long-term emission reduction measures which rely on technologies that are not fully developed for commercial use (such as fuel cells, hydrogen engines, and fly-wheel batteries) are considered as meeting Section 182(e)(5) requirements. Other  measures such as market-incentive programs which promote the advancement of new technologies, or long-term measures which rely on improving existing control technologies and have future compliance dates beyond 2000, are also considered as part of the Section 182(e)(5) control measures.
<P>The U.S. EPA approved the Section 182(e)(5) measures in the 1994 California Ozone SIP.  The long-term measures listed in Table 4-9 are those provided in the 1994 California Ozone SIP and serve as the Section 182(e)(5) control measures for the draft 1997 AQMP.  Many of the District and Mobile Source Air Pollution Reduction Review Committee (MSRC) programs and the associated fundings are intended to demonstrate new technologies for the long-term measures listed in Table 4-9, some of which are discussed in this chapter.  When the new advanced technology demonstrations are completed, an assessment is performed to determine the feasibility of the advanced technology.  If the technology is feasible, future rule development will be undertaken to realize the emission reductions associated with the long-term measures.  Thus, the advanced technology projects funded by the District and the MSRC are an important and necessary process in order to ensure the realization of advanced technologies within the next 13 years.
<P>As part of its action on the 1994 California Ozone SIP, an &quot;additional measures&quot; approach was provided by ARB to achieve further mobile source emission reductions.  No specific control approaches were identified with the adoption of the California Ozone SIP.  However, many of the advanced technology projects under the District&#146;s sponsorship could be feasible by the mid-2000s and would complement the market-based approaches for these additional measures.
<P>The advanced technologies proposed for implementation in this Plan are based largely on the projects funded or co-funded by the District's Technology Advancement Office (TAO), as well as projects funded by MSRC which was established in 1990 with the adoption of Assembly Bill 2766.  The primary purpose of TAO is to conduct public-private research, development, and demonstration projects in order to identify and promote low- and zero-emissions technologies for both mobile and stationary sources.  The District has developed a Technology Advancement Plan to comply with recent Legislative requirements.  This plan, which will be updated periodically to be as responsive as possible to technological advances, is available upon request and includes an overview of the TAO program, project planning and selection processes, and proposed project areas.
<P>The primary purpose of AB2766 is to ensure that District&#146;s and, in the Basin, local governments implementing CCAA have access to the funds necessary to implement the California Clean Air Act (CCAA) of 1988.  In addition, a fund of monies set aside to obtain emission reductions from mobile sources through a grant program developed by MSRC.  To this end, MSRC funding can be used solely for projects to reduce air pollution from motor vehicles.
<P>Some of the key technological advancements resulting from the District and MSRC programs are highlighted and reviewed below.  A 1995 report entitled &quot;Building Markets for Low-Emission Technologies and Clean Fuels:  A Status Report on Commercialization and Technology Transfer,&quot; which provides more detailed information on District-funded technologies, is available upon request.

<H3><A NAME="multi_app"></A>Multiple Application Advanced Technologies</H3>

<P><B><U>Fuel Cells /Advanced Battery Technologies</U></B>
<P>Advanced zero and near-zero emission technologies (such as fuel cells) are needed to help meet the District&#146;s air quality goals by the year 2010.  If deployed on a large scale, such technologies can achieve substantial air pollution reductions for a wide spectrum of stationary and mobile sources.
<P>Fuel cells are devices that electrochemically convert hydrogen and oxygen into electricity and pure water, with little or no emissions.  Most fuel cell systems obtain oxygen from ambient air.  Hydrogen can be generated through catalytic steam reforming of a hydrogen-rich fuel such as methanol or natural gas.  Fuel cells and batteries offer similar advantages over internal combustion engines, including zero or near-zero emissions, high fuel efficiency, good power, few moving parts, and low noise.  A key difference is that unlike batteries, fuel cells can provide continuous operation because they generate power from an external fuel supply.  Thus, fuel cell electric vehicles offer comparable driving range and refueling time to today&#146;s gasoline vehicles, while battery-electric vehicles must be recharged over the course of several hours from the electrical grid.
<P>Fuel cells are currently being developed for a wide variety of applications, and the District&#146;s technology advancement program has played a leading role towards expediting their commercialization.  For example, the District has formed and convened a Fuel Cell Implementation Task Force to help develop incentives for the manufacture of fuel cell technologies.  The District is working with the federal government and various private-sector entities to expedite commercialization of proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells in transit buses and automobiles.  As a follow-up to a District-co-funded project, by late 1997 one fuel cell manufacturer will deploy 10 prototype PEM fuel cell buses in revenue service at three North American cities.  The manufacturer has now achieved diesel-equivalent power density in its fuel cell powerplant for buses and cars, and is projecting commercialization of PEM fuel cell buses by 2000.  Virtually all the major automobile manufacturers are working on fuel cell passenger cars, and two have announced their intention to conduct pre-production demonstrations of PEM fuel cell cars within the next five years.  The District is also working with the federal government to develop methanol-fueled phosphoric acid fuel cell transit buses.  This prototype technology is now being optimized and scaled up, with prospects for commercialization by about 2005.
<P>Progress with fuel cells for stationary applications is also proceeding steadily.  Since the District became the first commercial site for a 200kW PC-25 Phosphoric Acid Fuel Cell (PAFC) unit for stationary power, more than 70 units are on order or have gone on line around the world.  Units installed between 1993 and 1994 have logged more than 7,500 hours continuously, with an average availability exceeding 95 percent.  Operating efficiency, in terms of thermal input (lower heating value of natural gas) to electrical output, has averaged 40 percent.  Measured emissions are so low that the District has exempted these powerplants from all air quality permitting requirements in the greater Los Angeles basin.  Noise levels are also extremely low.  The latest version of this PAFC technology, the PC 25C, is lighter, smaller, and costs about 40 percent less (from $5000 per kW to $3000 per kW).  The target cost, at which the PC-25 sales are expected to be self-sustaining, is $1,500 per kW.  The manufacturer&#146;s aim is to achieve this cost target by the end of 1998 through increased production and sales.
<P>According to a report sponsored by the ARB, entitled, &quot;Performance and Availability of Batteries for Electric Vehicles:  A Report of the Battery Technical Advisory Panel,&quot; dated December 11, 1995, improved lead-acid and nickel cadmium batteries will be used in electric vehicles in the near future.  However, a variety of advanced battery technologies which will provide greater vehicle range are being developed for use in production electric vehicles during the 2000 to 2001 timeframe and beyond.  Some of the most notable technologies include nickel-metal-hydride, lithium-ion, and sodium-nickel-chloride.  Honda and Toyota have announced they will introduce pilot fleets of electric vehicles with nickel-metal-hydride batteries in 1998.  Refuelable zinc-air battery systems which provide long vehicle range are also being developed.
<P>In July 1995, the MSRC created the &quot;Quick Charge&quot; program, intended as a large-scale pilot demonstration of electric vehicles within the jurisdiction of the District during 1996, 1997, and 1998.  This demonstration will aid local communities, manufacturers, and utilities to test the consumer market and demonstrate the infrastructure, permitting processes, and coordination that would be necessary for the eventual introduction of larger quantities of electric vehicles.  The pilot demonstration seeks to identify and resolve potential barriers to broad electric vehicle commercialization.  Among the various issues to be addressed are the following:  battery recycling, charging methods, codes and standards, consumer education and training, emergency response training, equipment availability, electric vehicle service capability, fast charging, home charging, incentives, permitting, remote charging, utility capacity, and utility electric rates.
<P>Concurrently, the MSRC has initially allocated revenues to be leveraged with local funding to create &quot;Quick Charge&quot; electric vehicle corridor communities.  This program supports the deployment of electric vehicles along designated freeway corridors and within specific communities that have committed to be electric vehicle ready.  Local government will play a critical role in permitting and inspection, adopting codes and ordinances, and providing public recharging infrastructure.
<P><B><U>Alternative Fuels</U></B>
<P>Significant advancements have been made in the development and use of alternative clean fuels for a variety of on- and off-road mobile sources as well as stationary source applications.  Alternative fuel technologies for on-road sources include methanol, ethanol, propane, compressed natural gas and electricity.  Numerous District and MSRC projects have demonstrated the viability of each of these fuels.  While progress has been made, further advancements or infrastructure are required for full commercialization.
<P>Emission reductions can be expected from light-duty off-road engines based on zero- or near-zero-emission technologies such as electric or battery-powered equipment or fuel cell-powered units.  These technologies are expected to eventually be used for the majority of light-duty off-road equipment (e.g., pumps, compressors, and forklifts).  For heavy-duty off-road engines (i.e., &gt; 50 hp), advanced alternative fuel technologies can also be relied upon to achieve additional emissions reductions.  
<P>Many activities of the District program are directed at crediting commercialization of alternative fuel vehicles that are fully certified and warranted under state regulations for light- and medium-duty vehicles.  In January 1994, the ARB certified a 1994 Chrysler natural gas minivan to meet the stringent ultra low-emission vehicle (ULEV) emission standards.  The Dodge Caravans and Plymouth Voyagers were certified to less than half of the nonmethane organic gas (NMOG) standard, one-sixth of the CO standard, and one-tenth of the NO<SUB>x</SUB> standard.  These front-wheel drive vehicles are equipped with a 3.3 liter V-6 engine using a three-way catalytic converter, heated oxygen sensor, and sequential multi-port natural gas fuel injection system
<P>Retail sale of ARB-certified methanol transitional low-emission vehicles (TLEV) has followed several years of strategically targeted demonstration programs, with co-funding from the District program, to address key commercialization barriers.
<P>To date, there are no light- or medium-duty propane vehicles certified to ARB low-emission vehicle standards.  Working both with original equipment manufacturers and aftermarket companies, the District program has sponsored projects designed to advance the state of the art in low-emission propane vehicles.
<P>Hydrogen also offers an extremely good option.  It can substantially eliminate a range of criteria, toxic, and global-warming pollutants by significantly reducing tailpipe, refueling, and evaporative emissions.  In addition, since it can be made from water and is recyclable, its supply is potentially inexhaustible.
<P>The fuel can be used in dedicated or hybrid internal combustion engines, or in fuel cells.  Ballard and Mercedes-Benz have already made substantial progress in developing hydrogen powered fuel cell vehicles.  However, the entry of such vehicles into the marketplace is constrained due to a complete absence of a hydrogen fueling infrastructure.  However, ARB LEV requirements mandate the establishment of alternate fuel outlets if vehicle sales, propelled by a particular fuel, reach 20,000 or more.
<P><B><U>Renewable Power Generation Technologies</U></B>
<P>Several technologies are on the horizon that involve the production of fuel for mobile or stationary applications from renewable energy sources.  Some technologies that have been demonstrated either through the efforts of the District and MSRC, or by others include: use of photovoltaics to recharge electric vehicles; generation of hydrogen through electrolysis of water which can be utilized for mobile or stationary applications; and generation of electricity with a solar concentrator in combination with a Stirling engine system.   

<H3><A NAME="advan_mobile"></A>Advanced Mobile and Transportation Technologies</H3>

<P><B><U>Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) </U></B>
<P>In recent years, many technological advances have occurred in making the vehicle and the highway more intelligent, mostly in order to improve traffic.  Several technologies are considered part of the general category of ITS including: traffic signal synchronization; interchangeable message signs; traveler information systems; automatic course finders; variable ramp metering; automatic fee collection systems; and vehicle platooning systems.  The District is a major participant in the planning and development of various elements of ITS.
<P><B><U>Remote Sensing Devices</U></B>
<P>Remote sensing devices (RSDs) are instruments capable of measuring instantaneous concentrations of pollutants in the exhaust of vehicles.  These devices have been in the development stages for several years and are now commercially available for use.  The District and others have been extensively involved in the research, development and application of RSDs.  
<P>In recent years, major advancements have been made in the technical capabilities of the devices such as the ability to measure volatile organic compounds, oxides of nitrogen, and carbon monoxide.  In addition, a program funded by the District demonstrated that RSDs can be used to detect high-emitting vehicles, and that most of these vehicles can be repaired at an acceptable cost.
<P><B><U>Advanced Add-On Control Technologies</U></B>
<P>Significant research is in progress to advance control technologies for on-road motor vehicles.  For gasoline vehicles, improvements in three-way catalytic converter technology (such as the utilization of greater catalyst loadings, improved wash coats, and electrically heated catalysts) have shown the potential to further reduce volatile organic compounds and oxides of nitrogen emissions by more than 80 and 50 percent, respectively.  Improvements in fuel management techniques, in an effort to maintain stoichiometric air fuel mixtures during warm engine operating conditions, have also been responsible for substantial reductions in vehicle emissions.  These techniques include sequential fuel injection, dual oxygen sensor systems, and adaptive transient control. These  technologies are  transferable to off-road mobile source applications as well as to the existing on-road vehicle fleet whose emission control systems have deteriorated or are of less advanced design.
<P>Relative to diesel-powered vehicles, it is anticipated that improvements in NO<SUB>x</SUB> reduction technologies will occur in the areas of lean NO<SUB>x</SUB> catalysts and exhaust gas circulation.  In addition, alternative fuels such as methanol and natural gas, used in diesel engine applications, have shown the potential to reduce NO<SUB>x</SUB> emissions by more than 50 percent.  Again, these technologies are expected to be transferable to off-road mobile source applications.  

<H3><A NAME="stationary"></A>Stationary and Area Source Technologies</H3>

<P><B><U>Zero-VOC Coating Formulations </U></B>
<P>Significant advancements have been made relative to the development and application of zero- or near-zero-VOC coating formulations.  Powder coatings, UV coatings for various substrates, zero-VOC interior flat architectural coating materials, as well as waterborne lacquers for wood products, are examples of technological advancements that have developed over the last 5 to 10 years.  The focus of the long-term control measure for this source category is primarily the small and unpermitted sources.  Therefore, in addition to control technologies, innovative implementation mechanism is also needed to successfully carry out the control program.
<P><B><U>Zero-VOC Consumer Products</U></B>
<P>Haircare products, deodorants and laundry cleaning materials are examples of products that contain VOCs.  The use of these products represents a significant source of emissions.  Lower VOC containing products have been developed, in part due to the California consumer products regulations.  Further development and use of less-polluting products are key technological advancements proposed in this Plan.   
<P><B><U>Fugitive Emissions</U></B>
<P>Fugitive emissions from industrial processes, chemical plants, refineries, and oil and gas production sources, or transfer and storage of organic materials contribute to overall VOC emissions.  Efficient and cost-effective technologies such as enhanced inspection and maintenance program, leakless valves, or vapor recovery device are critical to support further reductions from fugitive emission source categories.
<P><B><U>Miscellaneous Sources</U></B>
<P>This source category represented many small and unspecified emission sources and yet in aggregate a significant contribution to the overall emissions. Development of an emission reduction strategy, first requires a better emission inventory to identify specific sources of emissions.  Applicable controls or innovative controls can then be developed in conjunction with better management practices and effective regulatory programs to reduce emissions.
<H3>Emission Reduction Targets</H3>

<P>Table 4-9 lists long-term or 182(e)(5) measures calling for advanced technologies.  It represents the emission reduction targets beyond the short- and intermediate-measures.

<H3><A NAME="alter"></A>Alternative Control Approaches</H3>

<P>Spatial and temporal emission reduction programs offer a potentially viable method of<S> </S>reducing ambient concentrations of atmospheric pollutants.  These methods are described below and will continue to be further evaluated  in the future.
<P>An alternative to the application of the long-term advanced control technologies described above, or an in-concert approach, is the selective reduction of sources in certain geographical zones in the Basin.  Advanced technologies and control practices could be targeted for those areas of the Basin that contribute more significantly to the exceedances of the ambient air quality standards than other areas.  Under this approach, further advanced control zones would be identified and programs developed. 
<P>The District has evaluated the potential viability of spatial and temporal approaches.  As part of its analysis for the Environmental Impact Report for the 1994 AQMP, the District developed a control strategy based on the proposed control program as set forth in the 1994 AQMP, but applied the long-term VOC stationary source measures in the western portion of the Basin only.

<SUP>2</SUP>  "Alternative Fuels" are low emission vehicles using: methanol; ethanol; other alcohols, separately or in mixtures of 85 vol% or more; natural gas, both liquefied and compressed; LPG or propane; hydrogen; coal-derived liquid fuels; fuels derived from biological materials; reformulated gasoline; or any other fuel that can provide equivalent air quality benefits.
<P>


<SUP>3</SUP> "Advanced Emission Controls:" for gasoline and/or diesel include: electrically heated catalysts (EHCs); NOx reduction catalysts; oxidation catalysts; catalyst placement strategies; charge air aftercooling; wastegated and variable geometry turbochargers; electronic fuel systems; high pressure fuel injection systems; reentrant piston bowl; improved strategies for air motion in the combustion chamber; exhaust gas recirculation (EGR); oxygen sensors; on-board diagnostics (OBD) improvements; and particulate traps.




The district found that a long-term strategy based on such an approach can 
Provide equivalent air quality benefits, achieving all of the ambient air quality standards within the same timeframe as the 1994 aqmp.  Moreover, since the use of such approaches narrows the degree of control in the basin, they can significantly reduce the cost of the plan.
<p>This analysis represented the district's first step toward developing a comprehensive control strategy.  Further analysis was needed to define the specific geographic zones in the basin.  however, the necessary quantitative tools were not available.
<p>As part of the development of the draft 1997 aqmp, the district sponsored a study to develop an ozone assessment tool which provides the contribution from various source regions to ozone exceedances.  An alternative control approach is provided as part of the environmental impact report for the draft 1997 aqmp.  While the appropriate assessment tools are now available, further evaluations of the specific geographic zones are needed to fully address the socioeconomic impacts of geographic controls.

<P><B><u>Temporal/seasonal reduction programs</u></b>

<p>In addition to spatial reduction programs and long-term advanced technologies, reduction efforts could be directed at the time of release of emissions.  Under this approach, selective source emissions in the basin could be shifted to hours that would be less conducive to forming photochemical pollutants and to seasons with less photochemical activity.  One of the proposals of the intercredit trading program is to allow voc stationary sources to shift emissions-related activities to the winter season from the summer ozone season.  The environmental impact report for the draft 1997 aqmp provides an analysis of the air quality impacts of this alternative control approach.


<P><A NAME="overall"></A><B>OVERALL EMISSION REDUCTIONS</B>

<P>A summary of emission reductions available by the years 2006 and 2010 for short-, intermediate- and long-term measures is provided in Tables 4-10 through 4-13.  Emission reductions represent the difference between the projected baseline and the remaining emissions.  For 2006, Table 4-10 identifies projected reductions based on the annual average inventory for all criteria pollutants (VOC, NO<SUB>x</SUB>, CO, SO<SUB>x</SUB>, and PM<SUB>10</SUB>).  It represents the level of emission reductions needed to achieve the federal PM<SUB>10</SUB> standards.  For 2010, Tables 4-11 through 4-13 identify projected reductions based on the summer planning inventory for VOC and NO<SUB>x</SUB> emissions, the winter planning inventory for CO and NO<SUB>x</SUB> emissions, and the annual average inventory for SO<SUB>x</SUB> and PM<SUB>10</SUB> emissions.  Emission reductions by 2010 illustrate the extent of controls needed for achieving the federal ozone standard.

<B><A name="E9E1" >INTRODUCTION</B>
<P>Air quality modeling is an integral part of the planning process to achieve clean air.  As mentioned in Chapter 1, the submittal of the 1994 California Ozone SIP served as the ozone attainment demonstration for the South Coast Air Basin and those portions of the Southeast Desert Modified Nonattainment Area which are under the District&#146;s jurisdiction.  The attainment demonstrations provided in this Plan reflect the updated emissions baseline estimates, new technical information and enhanced air quality modeling techniques, and the control strategy provided in Chapter 4.
<P>The Basin is currently in nonattainment for nitrogen dioxide [ The nonattainment designation for NO 2  is based on the current federal classification, but the basin met both the federal and state NO 2  standards since 1993.] , PM<SUB>10</SUB>, ozone, and carbon monoxide.  Three of these pollutants - nitrogen dioxide, PM<SUB>10</SUB>, and ozone - are linked to common precursor emissions. The District's goal is to develop an integrated control strategy which:  1) ensures that ambient air quality standards for all criteria pollutants are met by the established deadlines in the federal Clean Air Act (CAA); and 2) achieves an appropriate rate of reduction in excess exposure to PM<SUB>10</SUB> and ozone over the next five to ten years.  The overall control strategy is designed so that efforts to achieve the standard for one criteria pollutant do not cause the deterioration of another.  A three-step modeling process was originally developed in the 1989 AQMP to develop the control strategy.  The three-step process begins with an analysis of future nitrogen dioxide air quality, followed by PM<SUB>10</SUB> air quality, and lastly, future ozone air quality.  Air quality analyses under the 1997 AQMP are performed in keeping with this three-step modeling approach.
<P>While attainment of all federal criteria pollutant air quality standards is the goal of all AQMP revisions, previous AQMP revisions placed greater emphasis on ozone air quality modeling due to the complex chemical and physical interactions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and oxides of nitrogen.  However, over the past ten years, a better understanding of the complex nature of PM<SUB>10</SUB> formation has led to a need to acquire enhanced technical information on PM<SUB>10</SUB> and particulate air quality modeling techniques.
<P>The control strategy to meet federal and state carbon monoxide standards is independent of the nitrogen dioxide/PM<SUB>10</SUB>/ozone strategy.  A photochemical grid model is used to project future carbon monoxide (CO) air quality.  As mentioned previously, the Basin has not exceeded the federal annual standard for nitrogen dioxide since 1991 and the state one-hour standard has not been exceeded since 1993.  Air quality modeling is provided here to demonstrate continuing maintenance of the federal and state nitrogen dioxide standards.  Visibility impairment analyses are also performed even though neither the CAA nor the California Clean Air Act (CCAA) specifically require that visibility be addressed for planning purposes.
<P>Detailed information on the modeling approach, data gathering, model development and enhancement, model application, and interpretation of results is presented in Appendix V.  The following sections summarize the results of the modeling efforts.  Future air quality projections for the Antelope Valley and Coachella Valley are presented in Chapter 8 and Appendix V.

<B>MODELING APPROACH</B>
<A ID="E10E1" NAME="E10E1"></A><p>
<B>Nitrogen Dioxide</B>
<P>A linear rollback approach is used to evaluate future nitrogen dioxide concentrations.  It assumes that the ambient concentrations above background levels are directly proportional to the emissions in the immediately adjacent areas.  In mathematical terms, the rollback relationship can be written as follows:
<P> C<SUB>p</SUB> = [(C<SUB>b</SUB> -k)<B>&#183;</B> Q<SUB>p</SUB>/Q<SUB>b</SUB>]+k<SUB> </SUB> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp(1)
<P>where C<SUB>p</SUB> and C<SUB>b</SUB> are the future year and baseline oxides of nitrogen (NO<SUB>x</SUB>) concentrations, respectively,  Q<SUB>p</SUB> and Q<SUB>b</SUB> are the future year and baseline NO<SUB>x</SUB> emission rates, respectively, and k denotes the background.  For the nitrogen dioxide analysis, the background concentrations are assumed negligible.
<P>Projections are made for several key locations in the Basin representative of areas with recent nitrogen dioxide violations.  Future-year annual average nitrogen dioxide concentrations were determined from projected total NO<SUB>x</SUB> concentrations using averaged NO<SUB>2</SUB>/NO<SUB>x</SUB> ratios for the period 1992 to 1994 at each of the locations.  The reader is referred to Appendix V for additional details on the technical approach.
<p><sup>1</sup>The nonattainment designation for NO<sub>2</sub> is based on the current federal classification, but the basin met both the federal and state NO<sub>2</sub> standards since 1993.<p>

<p><B>PM</B><B><SUB>10</SUB></B>
<P>Within the Basin, PM<SUB>10</SUB> particles are either directly emitted into the atmosphere (e.g., primary particles), or are formed through atmospheric chemical reactions from precursor gases (e.g., secondary particles).  Primary PM<SUB>10</SUB> includes road dust, diesel soot, combustion products, and other sources of fine particles.  Secondary products, such as sulfates, nitrates, and complex carbon compounds are formed from reactions with oxides of sulfur, oxides of nitrogen, VOCs, and ammonia.
<P>Because of the dual nature of PM<SUB>10</SUB>, a combination of different modeling techniques (receptor and photochemical grid models) is used to estimate the source contributions to ambient PM<SUB>10</SUB> levels as measured at different monitoring sites.  In addition, the air quality projections using the various modeling techniques are compared to a modified emissions rollback method (similar to that described for nitrogen dioxide, except that the rollback is performed on a component-by-component basis) to provide assurance that the modeling techniques are giving directionally appropriate conclusions.
<P>The following section summarizes the PM<SUB>10</SUB> modeling studies conducted in preparation for this Plan.  Details of the PM<SUB>10</SUB> modeling are presented in Appendix V.
<A ID="E43E1" NAME="E43E1"></A><p>
<B><U>PM</U></B><B><U><SUB>10</U></SUB></B><B><U> Technical Enhancement Program (PTEP) Modeling Studies</U></B>
<P>Due to the complex nature of PM<SUB>10</SUB>, a variety of air quality modeling techniques can be used.  Nonreactive PM<SUB>10</SUB> components such as fugitive dust can be estimated using chemical mass balance or source-receptor techniques where fingerprinting of various source profiles is necessary to identify source contributions.  In addition, dispersion models (both 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional) can also be used to estimate nonreactive PM<SUB>10</SUB> component concentrations.  Traditionally, simple linear rollback techniques (such as that used for nitrogen dioxide) are used to estimate nonreactive PM<SUB>10</SUB> components also.  For PM<SUB>10</SUB> components that are secondary in nature (i.e., species formed through chemical transformation), air quality models which have the capability to handle PM<SUB>10</SUB> chemical and physical processes.  Many of these models have been developed under research sponsorship and have not been extensively applied to-date.
<P>In 1995, the District embarked on a PM<SUB>10</SUB> Technical Enhancement Program (PTEP) to acquire new PM<SUB>10</SUB> air quality models or enhance the current PM<SUB>10</SUB> models in order to project future-year PM<SUB>10</SUB> concentrations.  Several projects were undertaken including the acquisition of an episodic aerosol model, a fugitive dust model, a source apportionment model, enhancements to the chemical mass balance (CMB) source profiles, and updating the secondary sulfate and nitrate chemistry used in the particle-in-cell dispersion model.  These projects provided a suite of PM<SUB>10</SUB> air quality modeling techniques that could be used to assess PM<SUB>10</SUB> air quality.
<P>Since the 1989 AQMP, the District has been applying a particle-in-cell (PIC) dispersion model to examine annual secondary sulfate and nitrate concentrations.  The PIC model has limited capabilities in examining large regions (beyond the boundaries of the South Coast Air Basin) due to the model&#146;s formulation and simple treatment of meteorology.  As part of the PTEP, the District embarked on modifying the Urban Airshed Model (UAM), the photochemical grid model used for ozone air quality analysis.  The UAM is a proven air quality model capable of modeling large complex regions.  However, the chemical mechanism in the UAM does not estimate secondary sulfate and nitrate concentrations.  As such, the PTEP sponsored the enhancement of a set of empirical relationships between precursor emissions and sulfate and nitrate formation.  (A similar set of empirical relationships was developed for the PIC model.)  The enhanced empirical relationships are incorporated into the UAM replacing the ozone photochemical mechanism.  Model performance evaluations with the 1995 PTEP ambient measurements indicate that the modified UAM (known as UAM/LC) provides reasonable estimates of the annual sulfate and nitrate concentrations.  In addition, the UAM/LC has the ability to model primary PM<SUB>10</SUB> emissions.  While the UAM/LC was developed to estimate annual sulfate and nitrate concentrations, the UAM/LC can also be used for shorter-term sulfate and nitrate concentrations.  However, intensive efforts must be undertaken to prepare meteorological and air quality inputs needed to perform the model evaluation.  The UAM/LC model evaluations are discussed in Appendix V.
<P>Previous AQMP revisions also used the Chemical Mass Balance (CMB) model to assess source-receptor relationships.  The CMB relies on source profiles to relate the contributions from various sources to measurements at a given location.  As part of the PTEP, some of the CMB speciation profiles were updated.
<P>In order to analyze local fugitive dust impacts, the PTEP identified a need for a fugitive dust model.  The fugitive dust model has the capability to analyze fugitive dust impacts on a very localized area which is smaller than the resolution of most more complex 3-dimensional grid models.  The PTEP envisioned that if the episodic aerosol model tended to underestimate fugitive dust concentrations, then the fugitive dust model results would substitute the fugitive dust results of the episodic aerosol model.  <P>The third air quality model in the suite of PM<SUB>10</SUB> air quality models is the source apportionment model.  The source apportionment model provides the additional capability to analyze the impacts of various sources at a given location.  While the source apportionment model can simulate 24-hour PM<SUB>10</SUB> concentrations, the primary purpose of the model is to evaluate different control strategies and the relative contributions from the sources affected by the control strategies.
<P>To analyze 24-hour PM<SUB>10</SUB> concentrations, an episodic aerosol model application study was sponsored under the PTEP.  The episodic aerosol model has been under development since 1989 with sponsorship from both the District and the Air Resources Board (ARB).  The episodic aerosol model has the capability to model all major PM<SUB>10</SUB> species.  However, since the model is a 3-dimensional grid model, it is inherently a resource intensive model and cannot readily be used to estimate 24-hour PM<SUB>10</SUB> concentrations.  While the PTEP project advanced the state-of-science of episodic aerosol model development, at this time, continued research is needed before the model can be relied upon as the primary approach to simulate 24-hour PM<SUB>10</SUB> concentrations.  In addition, techniques must be developed to expand the episodic PM<SUB>10</SUB> concentration estimates to an annual average value.
<P>Draft working papers for the 1997 AQMP provide discussions on each of the PTEP modeling projects.

<p><B><U>AQMP Modeling Approach</U></B>
<P>Receptor models require specific knowledge about the chemical components of the ambient PM<SUB>10</SUB> samples and of all sources emitting primary PM<SUB>10</SUB>.  Special studies were conducted to develop a data base and a comprehensive library of chemical profiles for specific sources of PM<SUB>10</SUB> emissions.  Using the CMB model, ambient PM<SUB>10</SUB> concentrations at each site can be apportioned according to the contributing sources.
<P>For secondary PM<SUB>10</SUB> components (sulfates and nitrates) and primary PM<SUB>10</SUB> emissions, the UAM/LC is used to project annual concentrations in the South Coast Air Basin and Coachella Valley.  Based on the change in PM<SUB>10</SUB> concentrations from the base year and future-year projected by the UAM/LC, the projected future-year 24-hour PM<SUB>10</SUB> concentrations can also be estimated.
<P>Using the CMB and the UAM/LC, the major secondary PM<SUB>10</SUB> components: nitrates, sulfates, secondary organics, and the primary, nonreactive, components can be estimated.
<P>These models are used in combination with emissions projections to determine future PM<SUB>10</SUB> air quality for a given future-year baseline or control scenario.  For secondary organics, a linear rollback technique is applied to the CMB results to obtain future year projections while the UAM/LC is used to project the other components. Measurements from the five PTEP monitoring stations are used (Los Angeles, Anaheim, Diamond Bar, Rubidoux, and Fontana).  The 1995 annual PM<SUB>10</SUB> concentrations represent the PM<SUB>10</SUB> design values for the South Coast Air Basin and all future-year PM<SUB>10</SUB> air quality projections are compared to the 1995 concentrations.  Detailed discussions of the model results are provided in Appendix V.

<p><B>Ozone</B>
<P>The CAA requires that ozone nonattainment areas designated as serious<SUP> </SUP> and above use a photochemical grid model to demonstrate attainment.  The photochemical grid model (or air quality simulation model) recommended by the U.S. EPA for ozone analyses is the UAM.  UAM is an urban scale, three-dimensional, grid-type, numerical simulation model.  It is designed for computing ozone concentrations under short-term, episodic conditions lasting one to three days.  UAM is also the recommended model for ozone analysis by the ARB.
<P>It is desirable to perform ozone air quality analyses using several different meteorological episodes.  Only one episode was modeled for the 1989 AQMP.  Since then, measurement data from the 1987 Southern California Air Quality Study (SCAQS) (Lawson, 1990) became available for modeling purposes.  For the 1991 AQMP, three ozone meteorological episodes were used to predict future air quality; two meteorological episodes during the SCAQS were used to complement the single episode from the 1989 AQMP.  For the 1994 AQMP, two additional episodes are added to the analysis.
<P>For the draft 1997 AQMP, the first modeling episode developed for the 1989 AQMP (the June 5-7, 1985 episode) is dropped from further use since the meteorological conditions rarely occur in the Basin.  The current form of the federal ozone air quality standard allows for one exceedance per year to account for these rare meteorological events.  As such, a peak ozone concentration due to meteorological conditions in the June 1985 episode would be accounted for in the current form of the standard.  In addition, the U.S. EPA modeling guidelines recommend that meteorological episodes from 1987 to present be used for attainment demonstration  Table 5-1 lists the four meteorological episodes used for ozone air quality analysis, along with their peak measured ozone concentrations in the South Coast Air Basin, Antelope Valley, and Coachella Valley.

<p><B>Carbon Monoxide</B>
<P>The CAA requires the use of an areawide model to describe the accumulation of emissions over several hours and kilometers within the region, as well as estimates of roadway impacts within a few hundred meters of the roadway intersection.  Based on U.S. EPA modeling guidelines, the UAM is used for the areawide analysis, and CAL3QHC, a roadway intersection model, is used to calculate carbon monoxide concentrations near the intersection.  The UAM results are used to evaluate the effectiveness of control measures in attaining the federal 8-hour air quality standard for carbon monoxide in the year 2000.  Carbon monoxide attainment demonstrations were submitted to the U.S. EPA in 1992 and 1994.  Since that time, newer emission estimates have become available.  Thus, the 1997 AQMP contains a revised attainment demonstration which will replace the prior submittals.  A complete description of the modeling analysis is presented in Appendix V.

<p><B>Visibility</B>
<P>Future-year visibility in the Basin is projected using the results derived from a regression analysis of visibility with air quality measurements.  The regression data set consisted of aerosol composition data collected during a special monitoring program conducted concurrently with visibility data collection (prevailing visibility observations from airports and visibility measurements from District monitoring stations).  A full description of the visibility analysis is given in Technical Report V-C of the 1994 AQMP.

FUTURE AIR QUALITY</B>
 
<p><B> <A NAME="E10E6" >Nitrogen Dioxide</B>
<P>Under the federal Clean Air Act, the Basin must comply with the federal annual nitrogen dioxide air quality standard by November 15, 1995 [Section 192(b)].  Since the annual standard is based on the calendar year, attainment must be demonstrated for calendar year 1994.  As discussed in Chapter 2, the Basin has met the federal annual standard the last four years (i.e., 1992 through 1995) and the state one-hour standard the last two years (i.e., 1994 and 1995).  The modeling results discussed next show that the Basin will continue to meet federal and state nitrogen dioxide standards.
<P>Figure 5-1 presents the predicted annual average nitrogen dioxide concentrations for 2000 and 2010 with and without controls.  Maximum 1-hour nitrogen dioxide concentrations are projected from the baseline maximum 1-hour concentrations using linear rollback.  The predicted maximum 1-hour nitrogen dioxide concentrations for the future-year baseline conditions with and without controls are shown in Figure 5-2.
<P>The trend analysis was performed using the highest nitrogen dioxide concentrations observed in the last three-year period.  Based on the more recent nitrogen dioxide measurements as discussed in Chapter 2, nitrogen dioxide concentrations continue to decrease over time.

<P>The results indicate that the federal annual nitrogen dioxide standard will be met throughout the Basin through the year 2010 without additional emission controls.  However, implementation of proposed controls after 1997 would further reduce nitrogen dioxide concentrations in the Basin.
<P>Based on projected future-year maximum 1-hour nitrogen dioxide concentrations assuming no further controls, the Basin will be in compliance with the state 1-hour standard through the year 2010.  Implementation of proposed controls after 1997 would further reduce nitrogen dioxide concentrations in the Basin.

PM</B><B><SUB>10</SUB></B>
<P>Under the federal Clean Air Act, the Basin must comply with the federal PM<SUB>10</SUB> air quality standards by December 31, 2001 [Section 188(c)(2)].  A five-year extension could be granted if attainment cannot be demonstrated and several other conditions are satisfied [Section 188(e)].  Figures 5-3 and 5-4 depict future annual average PM<SUB>10</SUB> air quality projections at five PM<SUB>10</SUB> monitoring sites compared to federal and state annual PM<SUB>10</SUB> standards, respectively.  Although each standard is based on an annual average, separate calculations are required because the federal standard is based on an arithmetic average, whereas the state standard is based on a geometric average.  In general, geometric averages are slightly less than arithmetic averages.  Shown in each figure are the estimated baseline conditions for the years 1995, 2000, 2006 and 2010, along with projections for 2000, 2006, and 2010 with control measures in place.  All areas will attain the federal annual standard by the year 2000, except Rubidoux, which will be in compliance by 2006.  Relative to the state annual standard (&#181;g/m<SUP>3</SUP>), Los Angeles, Anaheim, and Diamond Bar are projected to attain by 2006.  Rubidoux and Fontana will not be in compliance by 2010.
<P>The projections for the 24-hour state and federal standards are shown in Figure 5-5.  The results are similar to those for the annual standards.  All areas will be in attainment of the federal 24-hour standard (150 &#181;g/m<SUP>3</SUP>), except Rubidoux, which will be in compliance by 2006.  With respect to the state 24-hour standard (50 &#181;g/m<SUP>3</SUP>), none of the sites will be in attainment by 2010.

<p><B>Ozone</B>
<P>As the only ozone nonattainment area designated as extreme, the Basin must comply with the federal ozone air quality standard by November 15, 2010.  The attainment demonstration shown here addresses this requirement.  As discussed earlier, four meteorological episodes are used in the ozone attainment demonstration.  The modeling results for each of the episodes exhibit similar ozone air quality projections.  The results for the June 23-25, 1987 and August 26-28, 1987 episodes are presented here since these two episodes are more limiting than the other two episodes (i.e., July 13-15, 1987 and September 7-9, 1987).  The modeling results for all episodes are presented in Appendix V.
<P>The ozone modeling discussion that follows is divided into two sections:  projected baseline concentrations and predicted controlled concentrations.  The baseline projections assume no further controls in the future years and the predicted controlled concentrations assume the implementation of the 1997 AQMP control strategy at the appropriate level for the year modeled.
<P>Table 5-2 shows the total VOC and NO<SUB>x</SUB> emissions in the Basin on the first day of the June 23-25, 1987 episode.  The emissions presented in Table 5-2 are episode-specific and therefore differ from the planning inventories reported in Chapter 3.  The modeling results indicate that without additional controls, there will be some air quality improvement relative to peak ozone concentrations from 1987 to 2010 as VOC emissions decrease.  However, after 2010 the ozone air quality is projected to degrade slightly.

<P ALIGN=CENTER>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="mc5-7.gif"    ALT="Table5-2"></CENTER>
<P> The VOC emission reductions are due mainly to decreases in mobile source emissions whereas the oxides of nitrogen emissions decrease more slowly due to increases in off-road activities (see Chapter 3 for a discussion of future-year emission estimates).
<P>Figure 5-6 depicts the predicted baseline basinwide maximum ozone without further AQMP measures for the June and August 1987 meteorological episodes modeled.  As shown, basinwide peak ozone concentrations are on the order of 15-16 pphm from 2000 to 2010.  Similar modeling results are seen for the other two 1987 meteorological episodes (see Appendix V).

Control Strategy Impacts</U></B>
<P>Figure 5-7 shows the predicted Basinwide maximum ozone for the June and August 1987 meteorological episodes for the years 2000, and 2010, with proposed emission controls in place.  The maximum ozone concentrations and emission levels are also presented in Table 5-2.  The results indicate that the proposed control strategy will almost eliminate health advisories (<U>&gt;</U> 15 pphm) around the year 2000 and will bring the entire Basin into compliance with the federal ozone standard by the year 2010.  Regional maximum ozone concentrations in the year 2010 will be between 9 and 12 pphm for the four meteorological episodes.  With implementation of the proposed control strategy, the peak ozone value for the June 1987 episode is 11.9 pphm.

Future year ozone air quality projections for 2000 and 2010 with and without implementation of all control measures are presented in Figures 5-9 and 5-10, respectively.  The predicted ozone concentration will be significantly reduced in the future years in all parts of the Basin, the Mojave Desert Air Basin, and the Salton Sea Air Basin with the implementation of proposed control measures in the South Coast Air Basin.  Similar results occur for the other meteorological episodes.

<B><A NAME="E10E9" >
Assessment of Mobile Emission Uncertainties</B>
<P>As discussed in the 1994 AQMP, recent studies indicate that current and historical on-road mobile source emissions may be underestimated by as much as 60 percent for VOCs and 8 percent for oxides of nitrogen.  For the draft 1997 AQMP, an updated version of the emissions factor program (EMFAC7G) indicates that all on-road motor vehicle precursor emissions have increased compared to the on-road motor vehicle emissions estimated in the 1994 AQMP.  However, the emission increases are still uncertain given the uncertainties in the transportation model assumptions and the assumptions inherent to the current on-road motor vehicle emissions estimation procedures.  As faster computer systems become available, more sophisticated procedures for estimating on-road motor vehicle emissions will also become available.
<P>Future-year emission estimates for on-road mobile sources will most likely be more accurate as emission controls become more efficient.  As newer on-road vehicles are introduced, on-road emissions are expected to decrease and deterioration rates will be smaller.  It is not expected that future-year on-road emissions will be as grossly underestimated.  Future AQMP revisions will reassess the impacts of the mobile source underestimations as newer revisions to the mobile source estimations become available.

<P>As discussed earlier, future carbon monoxide air quality projections are based on a UAM analysis.  A carbon monoxide meteorological episode for 1989 was chosen for modeling as part of the 1993 Federal Attainment Plan for Carbon Monoxide.  This Plan uses the same December 6-7, 1989 episode with a recorded 1-hr carbon monoxide concentration of 31 ppm and an 8-hr concentration of 21.8 ppm.  These were the highest recorded values over the most recent years.  Table 5-3 summarizes the carbon monoxide projections by 2000 with implementation of short- and intermediate-term control measures.  Attainment of both the federal and state carbon monoxide air quality standards is projected in 2000 without any additional controls.

Visibility</B>
<P>The results of the visibility analysis for Rubidoux are illustrated in Figure 5-11.  Without the proposed AQMP control measures, annual average visibility is projected to improve at Rubidoux from the current average of 5 miles to 7 miles in the year 2010.
<P>With the implementation of all proposed emission controls for 2010, the annual average visibility would improve to about 10 miles at Rubidoux.

<P>Figure 5-12 shows the model-predicted regional peak concentrations for the four nonattainment criteria pollutants, as percentages of the most stringent federal standard, for the years 2000, 2006, and 2010, (with and without further emission controls).  Figure 5-13 shows similar information related to the most stringent California state standards.

BASIN EMISSIONS CARRYING CAPACITY (EMISSIONS BUDGET)</B>
<P>The District is required to separately identify the emission reductions and corresponding type and degree of implementation measures required to meet federal and state ambient air quality standards.  Section 40463(b) of the California State Health and Safety Code specifies that, with the active participation of the Southern California Association of Governments, a South Coast Air Basin emission carrying capacity for each state and federal ambient air quality standard shall be established by the South Coast District Board for each formal review of the Plan and shall be updated to reflect new data and modeling results.
<P>A carrying capacity is defined as the maximum level of emissions which enable the attainment and maintenance of an ambient air quality standard for a pollutant.  Emission carrying capacity for state standards shall not be a part of the State Implementation Plan requirements of the Clean Air Act for the South Coast Air Basin.
<P>Emission carrying capacity as defined in the Health and Safety Code is an overly simplistic measure of the Basinwide allowable emission levels for specific ambient air quality standards.  It is highly dependent on the spatial and temporal pattern of the emissions.  Because of the multicomponent nature of PM<SUB>10</SUB>, carrying capacity for the contributing emittants can vary significantly.  For ozone and secondary PM<SUB>10</SUB> components, the carrying capacity is a non-linear function among their precursors.
<P>The federal Clean Air Act requires that plans contain an emissions budget which represents the remaining emissions levels that achieve the applicable attainment deadline.  Based on the modeling results, a set of carrying capacities can be defined corresponding to federal and state ambient air quality standards for carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, PM<SUB>10</SUB>, and ozone.  VOC and oxides of nitrogen are used for ozone.  Table 5-5 shows the emissions carrying capacities for the Basin to meet federal air quality standards.  These estimates are based on emission patterns estimated for each of the federal attainment years (i.e., 2000 for carbon monoxide, 2006 for PM<SUB>10</SUB>, and 2010 for ozone).
  
<p><B><A NAME="E9E6"> 


PROJECTED EMISSION TRENDS THROUGH 2010</B>
<P>Figures 5-14 through 5-17 show the projected emission trends for both NO<SUB>x</SUB> and VOC through the year 2010.  Depicted are scenarios for the baseline cases (e.g., no further rules), and for the controlled cases (with the 1997 AQMP Measures).  Categories are described slightly different than most emission inventory summaries in that permitted sources (e.g., those emission sources which are permitted with the District) are specifically delineated.  These figures show that emission levels continue to decrease through the year 2010, especially for the controlled case, when attainment with the federal ozone standard is expected.  For VOCs, emissions are initially dominated by mobile sources, but in the later periods area sources will become a more dominant fraction.  For NO<SUB>x</SUB> emissions, mobile sources are expected to be the dominant source through the entire period.

<B><A NAME="E9E1" >PURPOSE</B>
<P>The purpose of the 1997 Revision to the Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP or Plan) for the South Coast Air Basin (Basin) and those portions of the Mojave Desert Air Basin and Salton Sea Air Basin under the South Coast Air Quality Management District (District) jurisdiction, is to set forth a comprehensive program that will lead these areas into compliance with all federal and state air quality planning requirements. Specifically, the 1997 AQMP Revision is designed to satisfy:  1) the State Implementation Plan requirements under Title I of the federal Clean Air Act (CAA) and 2) the California Clean Air Act (CCAA).  These federal and state requirements are summarized briefly later in this chapter.
<P>The 1997 AQMP sets forth programs which require the cooperation of all levels of government:  local, regional, state, and federal.  Each level is represented in the Plan by the appropriate agency or jurisdiction that has the authority over specific emissions sources.  Accordingly, each agency or jurisdiction is assigned specific planning and implementation responsibilities.
<P>At the federal level, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is charged with regulation of on-road motor vehicle standards; trains, airplanes, and ships; non-road engines; and off-shore oil development.  The Air Resources Board (ARB), representing the state level, also oversees on-road vehicle emission standards, fuel specifications, some off-road sources and consumer product standards.  At the regional level, the District is responsible for stationary sources and some mobile sources.  In addition, the District has lead responsibility for the development and adoption of the Plan.  Lastly, at the local level, Associations of Governments have a dual role of leader and coordinator.  In their leadership role, they, in cooperation with local jurisdictions and subregional associations, develop strategies for these jurisdictions to implement; as a coordinator, they facilitate the implementation of these strategies.  For the South Coast Air Basin, the Southern California Association of Governments is the District's major partner in the preparation of the AQMP.  Interagency commitment and cooperation are the keys to success of the AQMP. 
<P>Since air pollution physically transcends city and county boundaries, it is a regional problem.  No one agency can design or implement the Plan alone, and the strategies in the Plan reflect this fact.
<A ID="E9E2" NAME="E9E2"></A><P>
<B>CONSTRAINTS IN ACHIEVING STANDARDS </B>
<P>The District is faced with a number of constraints or confounding circumstances to achieving clean air.  These include the physical and meteorological setting, the large pollutant emissions burden of the Basin, and the rapid population growth of the area.
<A ID="E10E1" NAME="E10E1"></A><P>
<B>Setting</B>
<P>The South Coast Air Quality Management District has jurisdiction over approximately 12,000 square miles consisting of the four-county South Coast Air Basin and the Los Angeles county and Riverside county portions of what used to be under state classification the Southeast Desert Air Basin.  Figure 1-1 shows the boundaries of the District; also shown are the federally designated ozone nonattainment areas.  In May 1996, the boundaries of the South Coast Air Basin were changed by ARB to include the Beaumont-Banning area.  In addition, the Southeast Desert Air Basin was separated into two areas and renamed as the Mojave Desert Air Basin and the Salton Sea Air Basin.  The South Coast Air Basin is bounded by the Pacific Ocean to the west and the San Gabriel, San Bernardino, and San Jacinto Mountains to the north and east.  It includes all of Orange county and the non-desert portions of Los Angeles, Riverside, and San Bernardino counties.  The Los Angeles county portion of the Mojave Desert Air Basin (known as North county or Antelope Valley) is bounded by the San Gabriel Mountains to the south and west, the Los Angeles/Kern county border to the north, and the Los Angeles/San Bernardino county border to the east.  The Riverside county portion of the Salton Sea Air Basin and the Mojave Desert Air Basin is bounded by the San Jacinto Mountains in the west and spans eastward up to the Palo Verde Valley (Blythe).
<P>While the state action redrew the boundaries of the desert regions of Southern California, the federal ozone nonattainment area is still called the Southeast Desert Modified Ozone Nonattainment Area and contains portions from all three air basins.  The Salton Sea Air Basin portion of Riverside County east of the South Coast Air Basin (known as the Coachella Valley Planning Area) is bounded by the San Jacinto Mountains to the west and the eastern boundary of the Coachella Valley to the east.
<P>The topography and climate of Southern California combine to make the Basin an area of high air pollution potential, and constrain the District's efforts to achieve clean air.  During the summer months, a warm air mass frequently descends over the cool, moist marine layer produced by the interaction between the ocean's surface and the lowest layer of the atmosphere.  The warm upper layer forms a cap over the cool marine layer and inhibits the pollutants in the marine layer from dispersing upward.  In addition, light winds during the summer further limit ventilation.  Furthermore, sunlight triggers the photochemical reactions which produce ozone, and this region experiences more days of sunlight than any other major urban area in the nation except Phoenix.

<CENTER>Boundaries of the South Coast Air Quality Management District
<BR>and Federal Planning Areas</CENTER>
<P>The Basin's economic base is diverse.  Historically, the four counties of the Basin have collectively comprised one of the fastest-growing local economies in the United States.  Until recently, the aerospace and electronic industries accounted for about 20 percent of the Basin's employment.  Significant changes have occurred in the composition of the industrial base of the region in the past ten years.  As in many areas of the country, a large segment of heavy manufacturing, including steel and tire manufacturing and automobile assembly, has been phased down.  The aerospace and electronics industries have been reduced in scale by cutbacks in defense spending.  Small service industries and businesses resulting from growth in shipping and trade have replaced much of the heavy industry.
<P>Both the Antelope Valley and the Coachella Valley Planning Area are impacted by pollutant transport from the South Coast Air Basin.  In addition, pollutant transport occurs to the Mojave Desert, Ventura county, and San Diego county.  As part of this AQMP revision, transport issues relative to the Antelope Valley and the Coachella Planning Area are specifically addressed in Chapter 8 and Appendix V.
<P>In summary, the diverse geographical characteristics of the Southern California region place a significant constraint on achieving air quality standards.
<A ID="E10E2" NAME="E10E2"></A> <p>
<p><B>Emission Sources</B>
<P>The pollution burden of the Basin is substantial.  It has been estimated from prior studies that emissions of volatile organic compounds, oxides of nitrogen, carbon monoxide, sulfur oxides, and direct primary particulates in the South Coast Air Basin must be reduced by over 50 percent to attain the federal air quality standards.
<P>Air pollution forms either directly or indirectly from pollutants emitted from a variety of sources.  These sources can be natural, such as oil seeps, vegetation, or windblown dust.  Emissions may also result from combustion, as in automobile engines; from evaporation of organic liquids, such as those used in coating and cleaning processes; or through abrasion, such as from tires on roadways.  The air pollution control strategy in the AQMP is directed almost entirely at controlling man-made sources.  Where naturally occurring emissions can be mitigated, such as through windbreaks, they are included.  Otherwise, natural emissions are accounted for in the background and initial conditions data used for the air quality modeling analysis described in Chapters 5 and 8 and Appendix V.
<A ID="E10E3" NAME="E10E3"></A><p>
<p><B>Population</B>
<P>Since the end of World War II, the Basin has experienced faster population growth than the rest of the nation.  Although growth has slowed somewhat, the region's population is expected to increase significantly towards the end of the century and through 2020.  Table 1-1 shows the projected growth based on SCAG's regional growth forecast.
<P>Although per-capita emissions have been brought down substantially in the Basin through 40 years of implementing pollution controls, increases in the population over that time have made overall emission reductions more difficult.  Many sources, such as automobiles, have been significantly controlled.  However, increases in the number of sources, particularly those growing proportionally to population, reduce the potential air quality benefits of new controls.  The net result is that unless significant steps are taken to further control air pollution, growth will overwhelm much of the improvements expected from the existing control program.

<B>CONTROL EFFORTS</B></center>
<A ID="E10E4" NAME="E10E4"></A><p></CENTER>
<B>History</B>
<P>The seriousness of the local air pollution problem was recognized in the early 1940s.  In 1946, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors established the first air pollution control district in the nation to address the problems of industrial air pollution.  In the mid-1950s, California established the first state agency to control motor vehicle emissions.  Countywide or regional air pollution districts were required throughout the state by 1970.  Many of the controls, originating in California, became the basis for the federal control program which began in the 1960s.
<P>Nearly all control programs developed to date have relied on the development and application of cleaner technology and add-on emission control devices.  Industrial and vehicular sources have been significantly affected by this technology.  Only recently have preventive efforts come to the forefront of the air pollution control program, [e.g., alternative materials, waste minimization, and maintenance procedures for industrial sources].
<P>In the 1970s, it became apparent at both the state and federal levels that local programs were not enough to solve a problem that was regional in nature and did not stay within jurisdictional boundaries.  Instead, air basins, defined by geographical boundaries, became the basis for regulatory programs.
<P>In 1976, the California Legislature adopted the Lewis Air Quality Management Act which created the South Coast Air Quality Management District from a voluntary association of air pollution control districts in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, and San Bernardino counties.  The new agency was charged with developing uniform plans and programs for the region to attain federal standards by the dates specified in federal law.  The agency was also mandated to meet state standards by the earliest date achievable, using reasonably available control measures.
<P>Rule development in the 1970s and 1980s resulted in dramatic improvement in Basin air quality (see Appendix II).  However, the effort to impose incremental rule changes on the thousands of stationary sources under District permits was laborious and time consuming.  The District concluded it was possible that the limits of the command and control regulatory process were being reached.  The 1991 AQMP introduced the concept of a Marketable Permits Program and outlined the skeleton of an idea that was forerunner to what is now known as the Regional Clean Air Incentives Market (RECLAIM).
<P>A historical milestone occurred with the adoption of RECLAIM on October 15, 1993.  RECLAIM is an alternative means of achieving further emission reductions from stationary sources, different from the traditional source-specific regulatory program.  RECLAIM calls for declining mass emission limits on the total emissions from all sources within a facility.  The facility can choose from a selection of methods for achieving the prescribed emission reductions:  add-on controls, use of reformulated products, changes in production, purchase of excess emission reductions from other sources, and/or any other methods that would be enforceable and quantifiable.  At the time of adoption, RECLAIM was estimated to affect approximately 390 and 41 of the largest emitters of oxides of nitrogen and oxides of sulfur in the Basin and is designed to reduce emissions of these pollutants by 80 and 14 tons/day, respectively, by July 1, 2004. [ RECLAIM, Volume I:  Development Report and Proposed Rules ; South Coast Air Quality Management District; October 1993.] 
<A ID="E10E5" NAME="E10E5"></A>
<p><B>Impact of Control</B>
<P>Past air quality programs have been effective in improving the Basin's air quality.  Ozone levels have been reduced in half over the past 30 years, sulfur dioxide and lead standards have been met, and other criteria pollutant concentrations have significantly declined.  And for the first time in 1992, the federal annual nitrogen dioxide standard was not exceeded in the Basin.  However, the Basin still experiences exceedances of health-based standards for ozone, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter under ten microns (PM<SUB>10</SUB>).  Air quality summaries and health effects in the Basin are briefly discussed in Chapter 2; Appendix II provides an in-depth analysis of air quality as measured within the District&#146;s jurisdiction.
<A ID="E9E4" NAME="E9E4"></A>
<p><B>1994 AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT PLAN</B>
<P>In September 1994, the District and SCAG adopted an Air Quality Management Plan for the Basin which revised the previous AQMPs.  The 1994 AQMP continued an aggressive emission control program with primary emphasis on mobile sources.  The control program consists of short- and intermediate-term control measures and long-term (or new technology) measures.  The long-term control measures would be implemented after 2000 to achieve the federal ozone air quality standard by 2010.  The 1994 AQMP proposed a comprehensive set of control measures that included market incentive approaches for stationary sources, introduction of market incentive concepts that could replace indirect source control measures, and the use of advanced technologies for stationary and mobile sources.  The need to build the infrastructure for new mobile source technologies was also identified.
<P>The 1994 AQMP addressed specific requirements of the 1990 federal Clean Air Act and the state Clean Air Act.  Specifically, the 1994 AQMP provided an ozone attainment demonstration as required in the 1990 federal Clean Air Act and served as the triennial report update for the South Coast Air Basin as required under state law.  Upon the adoption of the 1994 AQMP, the District Governing Board requested that only those control measures necessary to the federal ozone air quality standard be forwarded to the U.S. EPA as part of the ozone State Implementation Plan (SIP).
<A ID="E10E6" NAME="E10E6"></A>
<p><B>State and Federal Approval Actions on the 1994 AQMP</B>
<P>Subsequent to the adoption of the 1994 AQMP, the California Air Resources Board (ARB) took actions to approve the 1994 AQMP as part of the California Ozone SIP.  In November 1994, the ARB approved the California Ozone SIP and replaced many of the AQMP mobile source control measures with statewide mobile measures.  In addition, ARB replaced the AQMP consumer products and pesticide control measures with statewide measures.  All of the statewide measures provide equivalent emission reductions to those replaced AQMP measures.  The California Ozone SIP was forwarded to the U.S. EPA on November 15, 1994 and a completeness finding was made on April 18, 1995.
<P>The U.S. EPA proposed two actions on the California Ozone SIP.  The first action on August 21, 1995, approved several of the long-term new technology measures in the Ozone SIP and several of the statewide mobile source control measures.  On March 8, 1996, the U.S. EPA proposed actions to approve the California Ozone SIP.  The proposed actions are anticipated to be finalized sometime during the summer of 1996.  As part of the proposed action, U.S. EPA proposed to enter into a consultative process to further develop the assignment of emission reductions to federal transportation sources (locomotives, ships, and aircrafts) needed to achieve the federal ozone air quality standard in the South Coast Air Basin.  The consultative process is anticipated to be completed by the summer of 1997 and if necessary, a revised ozone attainment demonstration would be submitted by the end of 1997.
<A ID="E10E7" NAME="E10E7"></A>
<p><B>Progress in Implementing the 1994 AQMP</B>
<P>Progress in implementing the 1994 AQMP can be measured by the number of control measures that have been adopted as rules and the resulting tons of pollutants targeted for reduction.  Since 1994, seven control measures have been adopted by the District through May 31, 1996.  Table 1-2 lists the District stationary source control measures that were adopted  through May 31, 1996.
<P>The primary focus of the District&#146;s efforts had been the development of the VOC RECLAIM program since 1994.  The VOC RECLAIM control measure (CTS-01) was put on hold by the District Governing Board in October 1995 due to lack of consensus on major policy issues.  Concurrent actions by the Governing Board placed the substitution measures identified in the 1994 AQMP as the primary regulatory program.  The District is currently developing regulations to implement the substitution measures and these measures are discussed in Chapters 4 and 7.

<P>Additional rules have been adopted by the ARB to further reduce emissions from mobile sources and consumer products.  In addition, the Phase 2 reformulated fuels program (known as California Cleaner Burning Gasoline) began in the spring of 1996 and is projected to further reduce Basin-wide emissions of volatile organic compounds, oxides of nitrogen, carbon monoxide, and oxides of sulfur. [ Emission Benefits Analysis - Phase 2 Reformulated Gasoline;  Air Resources Board; January 13, 1993.]   
<P>Local governments can play an active role in reducing mobile source emissions through the implementation of specific actions.  Since 1994, a task force jointly chaired by the District and SCAG has been working on possible market incentive approaches on-road pricing.  The REACH (Reduce Emissions and Congestion on Highways) Task Force has developed several such approaches for further analysis.  The status of the current efforts is discussed in Chapter 7 and in Appendix IV.
<P>The Southern California Economic Partnership (The Partnership) was established in late 1994 and has been developing approaches to initiate the development of various infrastructures needed for alternative fuel programs.  A discussion of the progress of the Partnership is provided in Chapter 7.
<A ID="E10E8" NAME="E10E8"></A><p>
<B>Global Warming and Stratospheric Ozone Depletion Policy</B>
<P>On April 6, 1990, the District adopted a &quot;Policy on Global Warming and Stratospheric
<P>Ozone Depletion.&quot;  The Policy commits the District to consider global impacts in rulemaking and in drafting revisions to the AQMP. 
<P>In March of 1992, the District's Governing Board reaffirmed this policy and adopted amendments to the policy to include the following directives:
<P><ul><li> phase out the use and corresponding emissions of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), methyl chloroform (1,1,1-trichloroethane or TCA), carbon tetrachloride, and halons by December 1995;
<li>phase out the large quantity use and corresponding emissions of hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) by the year 2000;
<li>develop recycling regulations for HCFCs;
<li>develop an emissions inventory and control strategy for methyl bromide; and
<li>support for the adoption of a California greenhouse gas emission reduction goal.</ul>
<P>In support of these policies, the District Governing Board has adopted several rules to reduce ozone depleting compounds.  Several other rules concurrently reduce global warming gases and criteria pollutants.  In the future, these policies will be further implemented principally through federal actions.
<A ID="E10E9" NAME="E10E9"></A><p>
<B>Toxic Air Contaminant Control Programs</B>
<P>The District is also developing and implementing rules to control Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPs).  These control programs have been designed to meet federal and state requirements.  The District is required to develop such programs under federal and state law.  
<P>At the federal level, Title III of the Clean Air Act provides a program for the control of 189 HAPs.  The first stage of the program involves the promulgating of National Emission Standards for HAPs (NESHAPs) to reduce HAP emissions from new and existing sources.  Major sources will be required to implement Maximum Available Control Technology (MACT). Area sources will be required to implement general achievable control technology (GACT).  This will be followed by a second phase in which residual risk will be evaluated and further controls considered.  
<P>The District will implement the NESHAPs MACT (including the standards) through its Title V permitting program for major sources or regular permitting for area sources (EPA has deferred Title V permitting for area sources for the next five years). The District continually evaluates its existing rules to determine whether they need to be amended to meet new MACT standards, or whether new rules need to be developed.   
<P>At the state level, the California state legislature has enacted several programs directed at toxic air contaminants (TACs).  These programs include the Tanner Toxics Act (AB 1807), Air Toxics Hot Spots Assessment Program (AB 2588), Toxic Emissions Near Schools Program (AB 3205), and Disposal Site Air Monitoring Program (AB 3374).  These programs are currently being implemented by the District either through the District rulemaking, permitting, monitoring or AB 2588 program.  
<P>The AB 1807 program, in particular, requires ARB to adopt air toxic control measures (ATCMs) to reduce levels of exposure and the risks associated with those levels.  At present, the District has developed and is implementing eight rules that control emissions from specific sources of TACs.  These rules meet and in some instances exceed the requirements set forth in the ATCM.  The District will continue to implement this program through new rulemaking as ARB adopts additional ATCMs.  Currently, under state law, the federal NESHAPs becomes an ATCM, unless ARB has already adopted an ATCM for the source category and the hazardous air pollutant(s).  
<A ID="E9E5" NAME="E9E5"></A><p>
<B>1997 AQMP REVISION</B>
<P>As mentioned earlier in this chapter, this 1997 Revision to the AQMP is designed to satisfy the planning requirements of both the Federal Clean Air Act and the California Clean Air Act.  The 1994 AQMP is the primary basis for the 1997 AQMP with many of the 1994 AQMP control measures carried into the 1997 AQMP.  A majority of the 1994 AQMP control measures are updated in terms of the proposed adoption and implementation schedule.
<A ID="E10E10" NAME="E10E10"></A><p>
<B>Federal Clean Air Act Planning Requirements</B>
<P>In November 1990, Congress enacted a series of amendments to the Clean Air Act intended to intensify air pollution control efforts across the nation.  One of the primary goals of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments was an overhaul of the planning provisions for those areas not currently meeting National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).  The CAA identifies specific emission reduction goals, requires both a demonstration of reasonable further progress and an attainment demonstration, and incorporates more stringent sanctions for failure to attain or to meet interim milestones.  The discussion that follows briefly presents the general planning requirements of the CAA, lists previous State Implementation Plan (SIP) submittals, and introduces CAA provisions that are addressed in the 1997 AQMP.
<A ID="E10E11" NAME="E10E11"></A> <p>
<B>General Requirements</B>
<P>In general, the federal CAA does not necessitate significant changes in attainment planning for the Basin in 1997, except requiring an attainment plan for PM<SUB>10</SUB>.  The CAA requires plans to provide for the implementation of all reasonably available control measures &quot;as expeditiously as practicable,&quot; including the adoption of reasonably available control technology for reducing emissions from existing sources.  Emission control innovations in the form of market-based approaches are explicitly encouraged by the CAA.  As mentioned earlier, the District is the first local agency in the country to adopt a market-based approach for controlling stationary source emissions of oxides of nitrogen and sulfur.  The CAA also requires plans to include standards for reasonable further progress, which is defined as annual incremental reductions in emissions of relevant air pollutants needed to ensure attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) by the applicable date.  A similar demonstration of progress was instituted in California with the passage of the California Clean Air Act in 1988.  This is discussed further later in this chapter.
<P>There are several sets of general planning requirements, both for nonattainment areas [Section 172(c)] and for implementation plans in general [Section 110(a)(2)].  These requirements are listed and very briefly described in Tables 1-3 and 1-4, respectively.  The general provisions apply to all applicable pollutants unless superseded by pollutant-specific requirements.
<P>Section 110(a)(2)(A) requires reasonable and enforceable control measures in plans.  EPA has interpreted this requirement to imply that control measures in a plan be in regulatory form (i.e., adopted rules) at the time of the plan submittal.  However, EPA has the authority to conditionally approve a plan revision based on a commitment to adopt specific enforceable measures by not later than one year after the date of conditional approval of the plan revision [Section 110(k)(4)].

<P>Provisions requiring that serious and above nonattainment areas submit an implementation plan that includes transportation control measures considering at least  the measures listed in Section 108(f).</TABLE><P>EPA guidance [ Emission Inventory Requirements for Carbon Monoxide State Implementation Plans ; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; OAQPS, Research Triangle Park, NC, March 1991.]  states that regulatory programs tend to be less than 100 percent effective for many source categories.  Rule effectiveness reflects the ability of a regulatory program to achieve all the emission reductions that could be achieved by full compliance with the applicable regulations at all sources at all times.  An effectiveness factor of 80 percent is required by EPA for all stationary source and non-tailpipe mobile source control measures for the future controlled scenarios.  EPA, however, does allow exceptions to this rule if data exists to adequately demonstrate that the &quot;real world&quot; control percentage is higher.  It should be noted that stationary point source controls are nearly 100 percent effective so an assumption of 80 percent rule effectiveness underestimates the expected emission reductions.
<P>The CAA requires that most submitted plans include information on tracking plan implementation and milestone compliance.  Requirements for these elements are described in Section 182(g) and Section 187(d) for ozone and carbon monoxide, respectively.  Chapter 7 addresses these issues.
<P>EPA also requires a public hearing on many of the required elements in SIP submittals before considering them officially submitted.  The 1997 AQMP adoption process includes a public hearing on all of the required elements prior to submittal.

<B><U>CAA Planning Requirements Addressed by the 1997 AQMP</U></B>
<P>Table 1-5 lists the CAA planning requirements addressed by the 1997 AQMP.  The main submittal is a PM<SUB>10</SUB> attainment demonstration SIP which is due to the U.S. EPA by February 8, 1997.  The table lists the relevant CAA section and submittal deadline along with the AQMP document or chapter where the submittal is discussed.  It may be used as a reference guide showing where each of the CAA planning requirements is addressed.
<P><A ID="I3" NAME="I3"></A><p>Besides the CAA requirements due prior to this plan revision (i.e., attainment demonstration plans for ozone, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen dioxide; 1996 Rate-of-Progress and Post-1996 Rate-of-Progress for ozone; and Best Available Control Measures (BACM) for PM<SUB>10</SUB>), the CAA requires the District to develop a PM<SUB>10</SUB> attainment demonstration, as given in Section 189.
<P>As specified in Section 189(b)(1)(A) of the Act, the PM<SUB>10</SUB> attainment demonstration is due no later than four years after reclassification of an area to &quot;serious.&quot;  The South Coast Air Basin and the Coachella Valley were reclassified from &quot;moderate&quot; to &quot;serious&quot; on February 8, 1993.  As part of the attainment demonstration, the plan must also contain emission reduction milestones to be achieved every three years until the area is 
<P>redesignated attainment and the emission reductions must demonstrate reasonable further progress as defined under Section 171(l) of the Act.  The 1997 AQMP is designed to satisfy the requirements of the CAA provisions for PM<SUB>10</SUB>.

<P>Appendix IV</TABLE><P>PM<SUB>10</SUB> monitoring data in the Coachella Valley indicate that (with the exception of one measured PM<SUB>10</SUB> exceedance due to a high-wind natural event) the area has attained the federal PM<SUB>10</SUB> air quality standard.  The U.S. EPA has recently released a natural events policy which exempts certain high wind events causing PM<SUB>10</SUB> air quality exceedances as being counted as a violation.  In applying this policy the Coachella Valley is now eligible for consideration by U.S. EPA as having attained the federal PM<SUB>10</SUB> air quality standards. The Coachella Valley Maintenance Plan is provided under separate cover and discussed in Chapter 8 of this document.  Certain portions of this 1997 AQMP will provide supporting documentation to that maintenance plan.
<P>With new technical information on emissions estimates, the future-year baseline emissions projections changed, thereby requiring updates to previous SIP submittals.  In particular, the emission budgets currently approved for federal conformity purposes must be updated and the California Ozone SIP for the South Coast Air Basin must be updated to reflect the best available technical information.  In addition, the Carbon Monoxide Attainment Demonstration Plan must be revised.  As such, the 1997 AQMP provides revisions to the previous SIP submittals.
<P>The South Coast Air Basin is the only area in nonattainment of the federal nitrogen dioxide air quality standard and must attain the federal air quality standard by 1995.  Monitoring data for the past three years have shown that the federal nitrogen dioxide concentrations were below the federal air quality standard.  Accordingly, the 1997 AQMP will serve as the maintenance plan for nitrogen dioxide.  As required under Section 175A(a), the plan must provide for maintenance of the air quality standard for at least 10 years after the area is redesignated to attainment.  In addition, the plan must contain contingency measures to assure that any violations will be promptly corrected.
<P>Section 181(a)(1) classifies the Basin as an extreme nonattainment area and states that the Basin must achieve the federal ozone standard by November 15, 2010.  As such, an attainment demonstration for ozone was provided as part of the 1994 AQMP and the ozone portion of the 1994 AQMP is part of the 1994 California Ozone SIP.  The ozone attainment demonstration followed U.S. EPA and ARB modeling guidelines and as such is based on the photochemical grid model called the Urban Airshed Model (UAM).  The model evaluation and attainment demonstration are fully presented in Technical Report V-B and Appendix V-A of the 1994 AQMP, respectively.  Based on new technical information, the 1994 AQMP ozone attainment demonstration is revised as part of the 1997 AQMP revision and the attainment demonstration is summarized in Chapters 5 and 6 and Appendix V.
<P>According to Section 182(c)(2)(B), the District must demonstrate how the Basin will achieve actual volatile organic compound emission reductions of at least three percent 
<P>per year averaged over each consecutive three-year period beginning from November 15, 1996 and ending November 15, 2010 (i.e., the Basin's attainment date).  The rate-of-progress milestone years for the Basin are 1999, 2002, 2005, 2008, and 2010.  Section 182(c)(9) requires that the post-1996 rate-of-progress demonstration must contain a set of contingency measures, that is, additional control measures which would be implemented in the event of a milestone or attainment failure.  Appendix V contains the detailed calculations of the post-1996 rate-of-progress demonstration.  Chapter 6 provides an estimation of the emission levels at each of the milestone years compared to the CAA target levels.  Contingency measures are given in Chapter 9.
<A ID="E10E12" NAME="E10E12"></A><p>
<B>State Law Requirements</B>
<P>The California Clean Air Act (CCAA) was signed into law on September 30, 1988, became effective on January 1, 1989, and was amended in 1992.  Also known as the Sher Bill (AB 2595), the CCAA established a legal mandate to achieve health-based state air quality standards at the earliest practicable date.  The Lewis Presley Act provides that the plan must also contain deadlines for compliance with all state ambient air quality standards and the federally mandated primary ambient air quality standards [Health and Safety Code (H&amp;SC) 40462(a)].  Through its many requirements, the CCAA serves as the centerpiece of the Basin's attainment planning efforts since it is generally more stringent than the federal Clean Air Act.
<P>Based on pollutant levels, the CCAA divides nonattainment areas into categories with progressively more stringent requirements (H&amp;SC 40918-40920).  The categories are outlined in Table 1-6.  The state nonattainment designations are on a county basis.  The entire Basin is an extreme nonattainment area for ozone.  Los Angeles County is the only county considered as a serious nonattainment area for carbon monoxide.  Although PM<SUB>10</SUB> is not explicitly addressed in the CCAA, it is governed by the Lewis Presley Act.  The plan therefore provides achieving all federal ambient air quality standards by their applicable date and state ambient air quality standards as early as possible.
<P>Serious and above nonattainment areas are required to revise their air quality management plan to include specified emission reduction strategies, and to meet milestones in implementing emission controls and achieving more healthful air quality.  The key planning requirements are provided in Table 1-7.  Some of these requirements are discussed in further detail in the next section.  Chapter 6 addresses how these requirements are met in the Basin.  The CCAA also includes some additional requirements that can significantly affect control strategy selection.  These requirements are provided in Table 1-8.  All of these mandates  have either already been met through District regulations or are included/considered in the preparation of 1997 AQMP.

<P>The CCAA requires, beginning on December 31, 1994 and every three years thereafter, that each district demonstrate the overall effectiveness of its air quality program.  For those areas that do not attain state air quality standards by 2000, a comprehensive plan update is required to be submitted by December 31, 1997.  The 1997 AQMP will serve as the comprehensive plan update for the South Coast Air Basin.

In Chapter 6, plan effectiveness is illustrated by trends in the following indicators:
<P><ul><li> volatile organic compound, oxides of nitrogen, and carbon monoxide emissions,
<li>nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, and ozone air quality (i.e., exceedance days), and
<li>nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, and ozone populational exposure above air quality standards.
</ul><A ID="E11E4" NAME="E11E4"></A><p>
<B><U>Emission Reductions</U></B>
<P>According to the CCAA, districts must design their air quality management plan to achieve a reduction in basinwide emissions of five percent or more per year (or 15 percent or more in a three-year period) for each nonattainment pollutant or its precursors (H&amp;SC 40914).  However, an air basin may use an alternative emission reduction strategy which achieves a reduction of less than 5 percent per year if it can be demonstrated that either of the following applies:
<P><ul><li> The alternative emission reduction strategy is equal to or more effective than the 5 percent per year control approach in improving air quality; or
<li> That despite the inclusion of every feasible measure, and an expeditious adoption schedule, the air basin is unable to achieve the 5 percent per year reduction in emissions.</ul>
<P>For emission reduction accounting purposes, the ARB has established a seven-year initial reporting period from January 1, 1988, to December 31, 1994 (Section 70701 of the California Code of Regulations).  The reporting intervals after this initial period occur every three years (i.e., 1997, 2000, etc.).  Therefore, the 1997 AQMP must seek to achieve a 35 percent emissions reduction for the initial reporting period and a 15 percent additional reduction for every subsequent interval.
<A ID="E11E5" NAME="E11E5"></A> <p>
<B><U>Population Exposure</U></B>
<P>The CCAA also requires that the 1997 AQMP control measures reduce overall population exposure to criteria pollutants.  Specifically, exposure to severe nonattainment pollutants above standards must be reduced from 1987 levels by at least 25 percent by December 31, 1994; 40 percent by December 31, 1997; and 50 percent by December 31, 2000.  Reductions are to be calculated based on per-capita exposure and the severity of exceedances.  This provision is applicable to ozone, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen dioxide in the Basin [H&amp;SC 40920(e)].  The definition of exposure is the number of persons exposed to a specific pollutant concentration level above the state standard times the number of hours.  The per-capita exposure is the population exposure (units of pphm-persons-hours) divided by the total population.
<A ID="E11E6" NAME="E11E6"></A><p>
<B><U>Control Measure Ranking</U></B>
<P>The CCAA requires the District Governing Board to determine that the AQMP is a cost-effective strategy that will achieve attainment of the state standards by the earliest practicable date (H&amp;SC 40913).  In addition, the Plan must include an assessment of the cost-effectiveness of available and proposed measures and a list of the measures ranked from the least cost-effective to the most cost-effective [H&amp;SC 40922(a)].
<P>In addition to the relative cost-effectiveness of the measures, the District must consider other factors as well in developing an adoption and implementation schedule [H&amp;SC 40922(b)].  The other factors noted in the CCAA include technological feasibility, emission reduction potential, rate of reduction, public acceptability, and enforceability.  Efficiency, equity, and legal authority have also been included in the 1997 AQMP for prioritization purposes because of their importance.  The results of the prioritization are given in Chapter 6.
<A ID="E11E7" NAME="E11E7"></A><p>
<B><U>Pollutant Transport</U></B>
<P>The South Coast Air Basin both transports to and receives air pollutants from the coastal portions of Ventura and Santa Barbara counties in the South Central Coast Air Basin.  The South Coast Air Basin also receives air pollutants from oil and gas development operations on the outer continental shelf.  The 1997 AQMP does not specifically address the control requirements for these adjacent areas.  However, the control measures in this Plan meet both the CAA and CCAA transport requirements and will assist downwind areas in complying with the federal ozone air quality standard.
<P>The Antelope Valley and the Coachella Valley are both classified as &quot;severe-17&quot; ozone nonattainment areas under the CAA.  The San Bernardino county portion of the Mojave Desert is under the jurisdiction of the Mojave Desert Air Quality Management District (MDAQMD) and is also classified as &quot;severe-17.&quot;  These areas must comply with the federal ozone air quality standard by 2007.  The CAA requires separate attainment and post-1996 rate-of-progress demonstrations for each severe air basin under the District's jurisdiction.  These were provided separately for the Antelope Valley and the Coachella-San Jacinto Planning Area in the 1994 AQMP Appendices I-A and I-B, respectively.  Revisions to the attainment demonstration for these areas are provided in Chapter 8 and Appendix V.
<P>Areas upwind of the South Coast Air Basin (primarily Ventura county, but also including Santa Barbara county and the outer continental shelf) will need to reduce emissions to allow those areas to come into compliance with all air quality standards.  If the South Coast Air Basin is to comply, sources in these upwind areas may need to reduce emissions further (i.e., reduce emissions beyond what may be required to achieve the standards in these areas).

<P><B><A NAME="introduction">INTRODUCTION</B>
<P>In order to achieve the improvement in air quality specified in the AQMP, the control measures listed in the Plan must be adopted and implemented within the timeframes set forth.  In the event that implementation of the AQMP is not providing adequate progress and the interim emission reduction goals have not been met, the District must take action to bring forward measures that are scheduled for later adoption or implementation, or to implement certain &quot;contingency&quot; control measures.  These contingency measures are control options that could be instituted in addition to the AQMP control measures.  Both state and federal Clean Air Acts require that district plans include contingency measures.  In addition, several measures are identified for further evaluation which could be adopted in the future if found to be feasible.
<P>A total of 244 control measures have been identified and categorized in two groups: Level I, or contingency measures, and Level II, or further measures which are not feasible at this time but will be reevaluated to determine if these measures are needed to attain state air quality standards or potential future federal ozone and particulates air quality standards.  Table 9-1 lists the Level I measures and Table 9-2 lists the Level II measures.  The following paragraphs provide a summary of these control measures.  A complete discussion is included in Appendix IV, Section 6.
<P> <B><A NAME="Level  I">LEVEL I:  CONTINGENCY  MEASURES</B>
<P>Level I measures are actions that can be implemented given existing statutory authority.  Such measures would need to be developed and adopted as rules.  The responsibility to adopt and implement the Level I measures falls on the District, ARB, and U.S. EPA.  The measures would be implemented in the order specified in the 1997 AQMP until the shortfall is eliminated.  A ranking of the importance of each measure relative to ozone and/or carbon monoxide planning requirements under the federal Clean Air Act is provided in Table 9-1 for the Level I measures.
<P><B><A NAME="Level II">LEVEL II:  FURTHER EVALUATION MEASURES</B>
<P>Level II measures are from the 1994 AQMP and have been determined as being infeasible at this time, requiring further evaluation.  It has been further demonstrated that the federal ambient air quality standards can be attained within the statutory time frames, without these measures, which are listed in Table 9-2.  The District will continue to assess these measures to determine if in the aggregate these measures will be beneficial in attaining state air quality standards and potential future federal air quality standards.

<P> <B><A NAME="introduction">INTRODUCTION</B>
<P>This chapter summarizes emissions occurring in the Basin during the base years 1987, 1990, and 1993, and projected emissions in the years 2000, 2006, 2010.  More  detailed emission data analyses are presented in Appendix III of the draft 1997 AQMP.  Additional emission inventories for other interim years (i.e., 1997, 1999, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2008) are also developed.  These inventory years are selected to comply with federal and state Clean Air Act requirements.  Under the federal and state Clean Air Acts, the District is required to report the Basin&#146;s emission reduction progress for nonattainment pollutants.  The base year to measure the Basin&#146;s progress is 1990 for the federal Clean Air Act, and 1997 for the state Clean Air Act.  Both 1987 and 1990 emission inventories were reconstructed to reflect the most recent inventory methodologies.
<P>The emissions inventory is divided into four major classifications:  point, area, off-road, and on-road sources.  The 1993 base year point source emissions are based principally on reported data from facilities.  The area source and off-road emissions are estimated jointly by ARB and the District.  The on-road emissions are calculated using the ARB EMFAC7G emission factors and the transportation activity data provided by SCAG.  The 1987 and 1990 inventories were reconstructed/backcasted based on the same general methodology as the 1993 inventory so as to reflect current knowledge.  For example, EMFAC7G was applied to the 1987 and 1990 vehicle activity data to backcast 1987 and 1990 on-road mobile emissions.  This approach provides a more consistent basis for evaluation of emission reduction progress.
<P>The future emission forecasts are based on demographic and economic growth projections provided by the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG).  The California Energy Commission (CEC) energy forecasts for the petroleum industry and gas appliance-related categories incorporating energy efficiency standards are also used to refine emission projections.  In addition, emission reductions resulting from ARB and District regulations adopted by December 1995 are included in the emission forecasts.   The rules and regulations adopted beginning in 1996 are treated as baseline adjustment measures to account for their emissions impacts.
<P> <B><A NAME="Emissions">EMISSIONS INVENTORIES</B>
<P>Baseline emissions data presented in this chapter are based on average annual day emissions (i.e., total annual emissions divided by 365 days) and seasonally adjusted planning inventory emissions.  The draft 1997 AQMP uses annual average day emissions to estimate the cost-effectiveness of a control measure, to rank control measure implementation, and to perform PM<SUB>10</SUB> modeling and analysis.  The planning inventory emissions developed to capture the emission levels during the poor air quality season are used to report emission reduction progress as required by the federal and state Clean Air Acts.  Three planning inventories are prepared for the draft 1997 AQMP:  an ozone inventory for summer volatile organic compounds (VOC) and oxides of nitrogen (NO<SUB>x</SUB>) emissions; a carbon monoxide (CO) inventory for winter CO emissions; and a nitrogen dioxide (NO<SUB>2</SUB>) inventory for winter NO<SUB>x</SUB> emissions.  In addition, the most recent U.S. EPA VOC definition (i.e., exclusion of acetone, ethane, and PERC) is applied for the purpose of  AQMP inventory development.
<P>Detailed descriptions of the base year and future baseline emission inventories are presented in Appendix III - Base Year and Future Year Emission Inventories.  
<H2>  <B>Stationary Sources</B></H2>
<HR WIDTH=100% ALIGN=LEFT>
<P>Stationary sources can be divided into two major subcategories: point and area sources.  Point sources are generally large emitters with one or more emission sources at a permitted facility with an identified location (e.g., power plants, refinery boilers).  Area sources generally consist of many small emission sources (e.g., residential water heaters, architectural coatings) which are distributed across the region.  Their emissions over a given area may be calculated using socioeconomic data.  For 1987, reported data is used for point sources emitting more than 8 tons/year of any one of the criteria air contaminants and the District's permit system data base is relied upon to estimate emissions for smaller sources; for 1990 and 1993, reported data is used for facilities with emissions greater than or equal to 2 tons/year.
<P>Area source emissions were jointly developed by the ARB and the District for a total of more than 200 categories. Several special studies were conducted to improve the area source inventory.  ARB has recently completed a statewide inventory for degreasing operations identifying solvent cleaning emissions not previously inventoried.  In addition, the most recent source test data for  restaurant operations (e.g., charbroiler and deep fryers) was used for the 1997 draft Plan.  There is a continuing effort to perform more source tests and the results will be incorporated into the final Plan, if applicable.
<P>Finally, significant progress has been made since the adoption of the 1994 AQMP to improve PM<SUB>10</SUB> fugitive dust and ammonia emission inventories.  The following sections summarize the progress and the results for a variety of projects related to emission inventory improvement.
<P><B><U>Fugitive Dust and Ammonia Inventory Updates</U></B>
<P>As part of the 1994 AQMP process, it was recognized that the fugitive dust and ammonia inventories should be reviewed and revised, if necessary, prior to the development of the 1997 AQMP.  Since that time, the District has participated in a number of fugitive dust and ammonia emission projects, as well as following projects by other sponsors.  Based on the results of these studies and more recent activity level information, the District has prepared updated 1993 fugitive dust and ammonia emission inventories.
<P><B><I>Best Available Control Measure (BACM) Working Group</I></B>
<P>The District, through the cooperative efforts of the BACM Working Group, embarked on an accelerated program to correct previously identified fugitive dust inventory deficiencies.  The BACM Working Group is an ongoing task force comprised of representatives from EPA Region IX, ARB, South Coast AQMD, San Joaquin Valley APCD, Great Basin APCD, Mojave Desert AQMD, Clark County Nevada, Washoe County Nevada, Maricopa County Arizona, Arizona Department of Environmental Quality, USDA Soil Conservation Service, Coachella Valley Association of Governments, and WESTAR (Western States Air Resource Council).  The emission inventory projects included studies aimed at improving emission factors for such fugitive dust sources as paved roads and construction, as well as quantifying previously un-inventoried sources.  Emission factors for entrained paved road dust and construction were significantly lower than previous estimates based on these studies.  Previously un-inventoried sources, such as entrained leaf blower and unpaved shoulder dust, were generally found to be small contributors to the overall inventory.
<P><B><I>PM</I> <I><SUB>10</SUB></I> <I> Technical Enhancement Program (PTEP)</I></B>
<P>The results from three emission inventory projects from the District&#146;s PM<SUB>10</SUB>  Technical Enhancement Program (PTEP) have been used to revise the fugitive dust and ammonia inventories.  The Fugitive Dust Integration project summarized previous inventory development and current and past emission factor studies.  It also provided recommendations for the best available emission methodology, emission factors, and activity estimates for each fugitive dust category.  These recommendations were used by District staff in the development of the fugitive dust inventory.  A second PTEP project was the development of a Geographic Information System (GIS) to prepare spatially-resolved fugitive dust inventories.  Spatially-resolved 1993 construction dust emissions have been prepared for the 1997 AQMP.  
<P>A separate PTEP project measured emissions from livestock waste at local dairies, since it was believed that current local dairy operations were significantly different than those used to derive previous emission estimates.  Results from this study indicated that the emission factor for local dairy waste was approximately 70% less than the factor used in previous emission inventory estimates, since earlier studies were not based on local area conditions.
<P><B><I>Updated 1993 Fugitive Dust and Ammonia Inventories</I></B>
<P>Activity levels for all sources were updated to the 1993 base year, which reflects the impact of the local economic activities as well as Rule 403 on construction emissions.  Overall, updated emission factors and activity levels for several categories led to a 52% reduction in fugitive dust emission estimates.  Figure 3-1 compares the changes in fugitive dust inventories between 1994 and the draft 1997 Plans.

<P ALIGN=CENTER>
<CENTER>1993 Fugitive Dust Inventory for the 1994 AQMP and the 1997 AQMP</CENTER>
<P>The 1993 livestock waste ammonia inventory is approximately 50% less than the 1987 emission estimate used in previous plans.  The reduction results from the reduced emission factor for dairy livestock waste and the 1993 animal population statistics, which showed a decrease in poultry from the 1987 levels.  It should also be noted that previous ammonia emission estimates for wastewater treatment plants were overstated compared to the ammonia emissions reported in the AB2588-required Air Toxics Inventory Report and from source testing.  Based on this and other information, 1993 ammonia emission estimates for wastewater treatment plants are now calculated to be 100 times smaller than previous estimates.
<H2> <B>Mobile Sources</B></H2>
<HR WIDTH=100% ALIGN=LEFT>
<P>Mobile sources consist of two subcategories: on-road and off-road sources.  On-road vehicle emissions are calculated using socioeconomic data and transportation models provided by SCAG, spatial distribution data from Caltrans' Direct Travel Impact Model (DTIM), and emission factors (EMFAC7G) obtained from the ARB.  The 1990 Census data is reflected in the SCAG socioeconomic data, and the 1991 origin and designation survey data is used in the SCAG transportation model.  Major improvements made to EMFAC7G include:
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>&#149; Redefining starts and redistributing starts by vehicle age;
<P>&#149; New start emissions methodology;
<P>&#149; Fuel corrections for diesel;
<P>&#149; High emitter adjustments;
<P>&#149; Driving cycle adjustments; and
<P>&#149; Implementation of adopted rules (e.g., enhanced inspection and maintenance program, 4.0 gram NO<SUB>x</SUB> standards for heavy-duty diesel trucks and urban diesel buses, and 2.5 gram NO<SUB>x</SUB> standard for heavy-duty gas trucks).<SUB> </SUB></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Based on the vehicle activity data and EMFAC, an upgraded DTIM model (i.e., DTIM2) is used to estimate on-road mobile emissions.  Figure 3-2 compares the on-road emissions between EMFAC7F and EMFAC7G. 
<P>Emissions from off-road vehicle categories (e.g., trains, ships, utility engines) were developed primarily based on the estimated activity levels and emission factors.  A special study was conducted by ARB to improve the emission estimates for pleasure craft and the District is conducting a separate study to inventory ship emissions.  As additional study results on ship inventory become available, they will be reflected in the final 1997 AQMP.

The modeling area is divided into a grid system composed of 5 km by 5 km grid cells defined by Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates.  Both stationary and mobile emissions are allocated to individual grid cells within this system.  In general, the modeling emission data features episodic-day emissions.  Seasonal variations in activity levels are taken into account in developing gridded stationary point and area source emissions.  Variations in temperature, hours of operation, speed of motor vehicles, or other factors are considered in developing gridded motor vehicle emissions.  Hence, &quot;gridded&quot; emissions data used for ozone modeling applications (Chapter 5) differ from the average annual day or planning inventory emission data in two respects: 1) the modeling region covers larger geographic areas than the Basin; and 2) emissions represent day-specific instead of average or seasonal conditions.  In the draft 1997 AQMP, gridded inventories associated with four ozone and two PM<SUB>10</SUB> episodes have been prepared for air quality modeling analyses.

<HR WIDTH=100% ALIGN=LEFT>
<P>The federal and state Clean Air Acts have specified the 1987 and 1990 emission inventories, respectively, as the baseline for measuring emission reduction progress.  Therefore, inventories for both years have been revised since the adoption of the 1994 AQMP to reflect improvements in emissions estimates and inventory methodology; this provides a consistent basis for emission trend analysis.  Most noticeably, a significant change in methodology has been made to on-road and PM<SUB>10</SUB> categories.  Tables 3-1 and 3-2 present the reconstructed 1987 and 1990 emissions by major source category for the criteria pollutants VOC, NO<SUB>x</SUB>, SO<SUB>x</SUB>, CO, and PM<SUB>10</SUB>.
<H2> <B>1993 Emission Inventory</B></H2>
<HR WIDTH=100% ALIGN=LEFT>
<P>Table 3-3 shows the 1993 emission inventory.  Figure 3-3 characterizes relative contributions by stationary and mobile source categories.  Stationary sources are subdivided into point (e.g., chemical manufacturing, petroleum production, and electric utilities) and area sources (e.g., architectural coatings, residential water heaters, and consumer products).  Mobile sources consist of on-road (e.g., light-duty passenger cars) and off-road sources (e.g., trains and ships). 
<P>Overall, total mobile source emissions account for 63 percent of the VOC and 88 percent of the NO<SUB>x</SUB> emissions for these two ozone-forming pollutants.  The on-road mobile category alone contributes about 53 and  64 percent of the VOC and NO<SUB>x</SUB> emissions, respectively and approximately  82 percent of the CO.
<P>Within stationary sources, point sources contribute more NO<SUB>x</SUB> and SO<SUB>x</SUB> emissions than area sources.  However, area sources play a major role in VOC emissions, emitting about two to three times more than point sources.  Furthermore, area sources are the predominant source (86 percent) of PM<SUB>10</SUB> emissions due to inclusion of travel-related activity.

<CENTER>Relative Contribution By Source Category to the 1993 Inventory</CENTER>
<P>In the mobile source category, emissions from on-road vehicles are much higher than those from off-road sources for all criteria pollutants except SO<SUB>x</SUB>.  This can be explained by the fact that the sulfur content in fuels used for off-road vehicles is relatively higher than those for on-road vehicles.  
<P>Figure 3-4 compares the 1993 inventory with the reconstructed 1987 and 1990 inventories.  As can be seen, slight emission reductions are shown for all stationary source pollutants due to adopted air regulations.  Existing ARB vehicle regulations result in reductions in VOC and CO.    The noticeable increase in NO<SUB>x</SUB> emissions between 1987 and 1990 is due the shift to 1990 census data as well as the estimated increase in heavy-duty vehicle VMTs.

<HR WIDTH=100% ALIGN=LEFT>
<P>The milestone years 1996, 1997, 1999, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2008, and 2010 are the target years for emissions rate-of-progress estimates under the federal Clean Air Act and the state Clean Air Act.  In addition, an emissions inventory for the year 2020 is also prepared for the first time to form the basis for the design of a maintenance analysis once the region attains the federal clean air standards.  Due to the adoption of the NO<SUB>x</SUB> and SO<SUB>x</SUB> RECLAIM program in October 1993, future emissions are divided into RECLAIM and non-RECLAIM emissions.  Future NO<SUB>x</SUB> and SO<SUB>x</SUB> emissions from RECLAIM sources are estimated based on their initial allocations as specified by District Rule 2002.  The revised allocations for the six source categories as part of District Rule 2015 technology review are incorporated in the RECLAIM emission forecast.  The forecasts for non-RECLAIM emissions were derived using: 1) emissions from the 1993 base year; 2) expected controls after implementation of District and ARB rules adopted by December 31, 1995; and 3) emissions growth in various source categories between the base and future years.  Rules adopted after  December 31, 1995 are treated as baseline adjustment measures for emissions reduction accounting purposes.  A detailed description of the forecasting methodology is provided in Appendix III of the draft 1997 AQMP.  
<P>Demographic growth forecasts for various socioeconomic categories (e.g., population, housing, employment by industries), developed by SCAG, were used to estimate future emissions.  The 1990 Census data were used to validate the 1990 socioeconomic data and future growth.  Industry growth factors for 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2020 were provided by SCAG.  Growth factors for other interim years were interpolated between key forecast years.  CEC-adopted energy efficiency standards and energy-based forecasts for the petroleum industry are also used to improve emission forecasts for certain gas appliance and refinery operation related categories.  Table 3-4 summarizes key socioeconomic parameters used in the draft 1997 AQMP for emissions inventory development.

<P>Current forecasts indicate that this region will experience a population growth of 22 percent by the year 2010 with a 32 percent increase in vehicle miles traveled (VMT).  The current projection for the year 2010 shows about half a million decrease in population and a 29-million mile decrease in VMT forecast as compared to the projection from the 1994 AQMP.  The differences in the forecasts are primarily due to the charge in base year from 1990 to 1998.
<H2> B>Summary of Baseline Emissions</B></H2>
<HR WIDTH=100% ALIGN=LEFT>
<P>Emission data by source categories (point, area, on-road mobile and off-road mobile sources) and by pollutants are presented in Tables 3-5 through 3-7 for the years 2000, 2006, and 2010.
<P>Without any additional controls, VOC, NO<SUB>x</SUB>, and CO emissions are expected to decrease due to existing regulations, such as the LEV and oxygenated fuel programs, and the RECLAIM program.  Figure 3-5 illustrates the relative contribution to the 2010 inventory by source category.  A comparison between Figures 3-3 and 3-5 indicates that the on-road mobile category continues to be a major contributor to CO and NO<SUB>x</SUB> emissions.  However, due to the adopted LEV regulation, by 2010 on-road mobile accounts for about 22 percent of total VOC emissions compared to 53 percent in 1993.  Meanwhile, area sources become the major contributor to VOC emissions from 29 percent in 1993 to 48 percent in 2010.

  <B>INTRODUCTION</B>

<P>
Achieving clean air objectives requires the effective and timely implementation
of the measures defined in Chapter 4. In general, these measures rely on
the application and advancement of technologies and management practices.
These strategies also require actions by numerous agencies.
<P>
<A ID="E9E2" NAME="E9E2"></A>
  <B>RESPONSIBLE AGENCIES</B>

<P>
Implementation of the Plan's strategies requires a cooperative partnership
of governmental agencies at the federal, state, regional and local level.
As described in Table 7-1, these agencies form the four cornerstones from
which implementation programs will evolve.
<P>
At the federal level is the U.S. EPA and other agencies charged with reducing
emissions from federally controlled sources such as commercial aircraft and
marine vessels. As discussed in Chapter 4, the draft 1997 AQMP incorporates
several measures based largely on the 1994 California Ozone SIP. Seven of
the mobile source measures are directed at federally regulated sources.
<P>
At the state level is the ARB which is responsible for motor vehicle emissions
and fuels. The Plan's on-road and off-road mobile source control program
is principally based on the 1994 California Ozone SIP. Additional mobile
source emission reduction credit programs are provided in this Plan to provide
greater regulatory flexibility and accelerate fleet turnover.
<P>
At the regional level, the District is responsible for the overall development
and implementation of the AQMP. The District is specifically authorized to
reduce the emissions from stationary and some area sources such as coatings
and solvents. The District implements its responsibilities with participation
from the regulated community through an extensive rule development and
implementation program. This approach maximizes the input of those parties
affected by the proposed rule through consultation meetings, public workshops,
and ongoing working groups.
<P>
At the local level are local governments and the Southern California Association
of Governments (SCAG) and other committees of government. Local governments
serve an important role in developing and implementing the Plan's transportation
control measures. SCAG is responsible for providing the socioeconomic forecast
(e.g., population forecasts) upon which the Plan is based. SCAG also provides
assessments for conformity of regionally significant projects with the overall
Plan and is responsible for the adoption of the annual Regional Transportation
Improvement Program.

  <B>SHORT- AND INTERMEDIATE-TERM MEASURES</B>

<P>
The Plan proposes measures that can be implemented using currently available
technologies and management practices. Measures in this category are to be
implemented by all levels of government including federal agencies, the state
ARB, the District and local governments and SCAG.
<P>
<A ID="E10E1" NAME="E10E1"></A> <B>Control Measure Ranking</B>
<P>
The California Clean Air Act requires air pollution control districts to
assess the effectiveness of control measures in reducing ambient ozone
concentrations as part of their plan submittals. The CCAA requires districts
to determine that their AQMPs are cost-effective strategies that attain air
quality standards by the earliest practicable date [H&amp;SC 40913(b)]. In
addition, plans must include an assessment of the cost-effectiveness of available
and proposed control measures and a list of the measures ranked from the
least cost-effective to the most cost-effective [H&amp;SC 40922(a)]. Table
6-5 in Chapter 6 shows the ranking of the control measures by cost-effectiveness.
In developing their control strategy implementation schedule, districts must
consider the other effectiveness criteria [H&amp;SC 40922(b)]. The criteria
used for this Plan are listed in Table 7-2.

<P>
Table 7-3 lists the short- and intermediate-term control measures, the
responsible agencies, and the proposed adoption and implementation dates.
This preliminary schedule is largely based on the schedule set forth in the
1994 AQMP as modified through subsequent District Board action. New items
proposed for the first time in this Plan have been placed in the appropriate
position on the existing schedule based on a review of the AQMP control measure
prioritization factors described above. The proposed implementation dates
of the control measures will be further assessed during public review to
this draft Plan.
<P>
Other measures from the 1994 AQMP that are not included in Table 7-3 have
been moved to the Level II Contingency Category. These measures will undergo
further evaluation after 1997 AQMP proposal to determine if these measures
can serve as contingency or provide addition emission reductions to achieve
state air pollution standards or potential future federal air quality standards.

<A ID="E10E2" NAME="E10E2"></A> <B>Federal Agencies</B>
<P>
The Plan proposes to incorporate several measures defined in the 1994 California
Ozone SIP that are directed at federally regulated sources. Specifically,
the Plan contains seven measures relative to sources such as planes, ships,
trains, most construction and farm equipment, industrial equipment, and
off-highway vehicles. These SIP-related measures are listed on Table 7-3.
<A ID="E10E3" NAME="E10E3"></A>
<P>
<B>ARB</B>
<P>
Several measures are proposed to be implemented by the ARB. One of the most
important of these measures is the implementation of the scrappage program
(i.e., M1).
<P>
The ARB is also responsible for adopting some of the off-road mobile source
emission standards, and will be implementing the control measures in the
AQMP directed towards reducing emissions from consumer products. Table 7-3
identifies the control measures that ARB (and other state agencies) will
be responsible for implementing in the 1997 AQMP.
<P>
There are several other state agencies that will need to implement control
measures which fall within their authority. For example, the state Department
of Pesticides Regulation (DPR) has direct authority over pesticide applications.
ARB will have a key role in working with the DPR, along with the District,
to ensure that the measure is implemented. <A ID="E10E4" NAME="E10E4"></A>
<P>
<B>District</B>
<P>
The District is responsible for implementing the stationary source control
measures and some of the area and mobile source measures. As shown in Table
7-3, stationary source control measures will be implemented primarily through
District rules and regulations as specified in federal and state law.
<A ID="E11E1" NAME="E11E1"></A>
<P>
<B><U>Stationary and Area Source Measures</U></B>
<P>
As indicated in Chapter 4, several key new approaches are proposed for
implementing the stationary source emission reduction measures. Specifically,
the Plan proposes to use source-specific control approaches, market incentives,
educational outreach efforts, permitting processes, and manufacturer
certification processes to implement most of the stationary source measures.
In addition, the Intercredit Trading Program and the Air Quality Investment
Program will provide greater flexibility to stationary sources to comply
with District regulations. Chapter 4 and Appendix IV provide more detail
relative to these implementation approaches. <A ID="E11E2" NAME="E11E2"></A>
<P>
<B><U>Transportation Control Measures</U></B>
<P>
<A ID="E12E1" NAME="E12E1"></A> <B><I>Market Incentive Measures</I></B>
<P>
A market incentives task force was established with SCAG, CalTrans, the Coalition
for Local Environmental Solutions and a Competitive Economy (COALESCE), the
District and over 50 business and industry leaders to develop a regional
congestion and air quality mitigation program to replace the Indirect Source
Rules contained in the 1994 AQMP and to improve mobility in the region. The
Reduce Emissions And Congestion on Highways (REACH) Task Force was convened
in response to actions called for in the 1994 AQMP and SCAG's Market Incentives
Task Force. Under a $1.1 million grant from the Federal Highway Administration
and a $220,000<B> </B>contribution from COALESCE, the REACH Task Force is
exploring the feasibility of establishing nominal charges for motorists based
upon vehicle use to improve mobility and air quality. Money raised through
these fees would likely be dedicated to improving air quality, and the
transportation system.and develop an action plan to implement the most feasible
and cost-effective market incentive programs proposed in the Plan.
<A ID="E12E2" NAME="E12E2"></A>
<P>
<B><I>Local Governments and SCAG</I></B>
<P>
Local governments (cities and counties) are also responsible for helping
to provide supportive actions through participation in voluntary programs.
Local governments and transportation agencies are also responsible for
implementing several measures in the Plan including, but not limited to,
the transportation improvements called for in the Plan. SCAG is responsible
for helping local governments coordinate their efforts and for ensuring that
the region's transportation projects, programs and plans conform to the SIP.
<A ID="E11E3" NAME="E11E3"></A>
<P>
<B><U>Congestion Management Plan (CMP) Linkage to the AQMP</U></B>
<P>
The CMP is a comprehensive strategy to relieve traffic congestion and maintain
levels of service on roadways. Assembly Bill (AB) 471 and AB 1791 required
county transportation commissions (CTCs) or other designated agencies to
adopt a CMP by December 1, 1991. County CMPs have subsequently been developed
in consultation with the regional transportation planning agency (i.e., SCAG),
regional transportation providers, local governments, Caltrans, and the District.
<P>
The CMP interlinks with the AQMP in several areas. Most AQMP transportation
control measures included in the Regional Transportation Improvement Program
are designed to help relieve congestion. Implementation of the AQMP will
help local governments tackle congestion, reduce emissions from idling vehicles
or vehicles traveling on congested roadways, and help maintain the CMP's
level of service standards.
<P>
Many local governments already have ordinances under development or approved
to comply with the CMP. Through the CMP, local governments have contributed
to the clean air effort. Local governments may receive credits for emission
reductions associated with the implementation of CMPs to the extent they
are real, quantifiable, and enforceable and have not been included in the
AQMP baseline as part of the Regional Mobility Element (RME).
<P>
The CMP and the AQMP are further linked through the local capital improvement
program. This required element of the CMP must be consistent with the county
and Regional Transportation Improvement Program (RTIP), which in turn must
be consistent with the RME. The latter in turn must conform with the AQMP.
<P>
In addition, local governments are encouraged to work cooperatively with
their CTCs and subregional agencies to craft integrated trip reduction strategies
to meet the CMP trip reduction requirements. <A ID="E10E5" NAME="E10E5"></A>
<P>
<B>Southern California Economic Partnership (The Partnership)</B>
<P>
The Partnership is a non-profit organization with a 26-member Board of Directors
assigned the mission of accelerating the deployment of advanced transportation
technologies (ATTs) throughout Southern California. It was established out
of the needs of the SCAG Regional Mobility Element and the 1994 AQMP to have
an effective implementation organization for advanced transportation technology
strategies.
<P>
The Partnership, through its public/private participatory structure, is uniquely
capable of providing networking and guidance to those parties interested
in the deployment of advanced transportation technologies throughout Southern
California. Stakeholder "cluster group" meetings on each technology are held
on a regular basis, usually at the AQMD or at SCAG offices, to discuss
implementation barriers and assist in the development of deployment and marketing
strategies. It has in effect become a clearinghouse of ATT information and
progress.<P>
To aid Southern California cities and counties in ATT deployment, The Partnership
has developed "Model City Starter Kits" for each of the technologies. These
books provide goals and objectives, implementation worksheets, model policies,
model resolutions, building codes, product/service technology updates,
infrastructure suggestions and requirements, training and safety requirements,
case studies, funding opportunities and an activity recognition program.
The Partnership provides these comprehensive guide books free to each Southern
California community and conducts workshops and presentations to encourage
participants to use ATTs. It also develops and distributes ATT newsletters
and promotional materials to heighten awareness and garner unified understanding
and support for the technologies from both the public and private sectors.
Most of this information is also presented on The Partnership's Web Site
which is continuously updated with deployment achievements throughout the
region. Measures to be carried out by The Partnership are non-regulatory
&amp; thus do not have specific "adoption" dates but will be implemented
through the AQMP planning period. Legislation may assist in implementing
these measures but it is too early to establish specific adoption dates.
<A ID="E11E4" NAME="E11E4"></A>
<P>
<B><U>The Partnership Market Deployment Plan</U></B>
<P>
The Partnership applies the same market deployment strategic planning to
each of the five AQMP advanced technologies. The approach is multi-disciplinary,
totally integrated, constantly evolving and consists of: 1) deployment education
and guidance, 2) workshops and outreach, 3) technology/industry communications
and awareness programs, 4) information distribution and networking support,
5) partnership creation/brokering, and 6) legislative initiatives and actions.
<A ID="E11E5" NAME="E11E5"></A>
<P>
<B><U>Deployment Education and Guidance</U></B>
<P>
"Model City Starter Kits, " presented in easy-to-update three-ring binders,
have been created for each of the technologies and distributed free of charge
to every city and county in the South Coast Air Basin and the SCAG region.
<A ID="E11E6" NAME="E11E6"></A>
<P>
<B><U>Workshops and Outreach</U></B>
<P>
To generate additional interest and understanding of technology deployment,
The Partnership occasionally hosts technology workshops at the District and
other convenient locations for local elected officials, city planners and
managers, with considerable private sector involvement and support. In addition
to these workshops, The Partnership also: 1) makes presentations to cities,
schools and organizations; 2) distributes monthly technology "News Flashes"
to all stakeholders via facsimile; and 3) attends the meetings of related
organizations and project developers. <A ID="E11E7" NAME="E11E7"></A>
<P>
<B><U>Technology/Industry Communications and Awareness Programs</U></B>
<P>
The Partnership has created individual technology/industry logos and slogans
to help give a singular identity, purpose and synergy to advanced transportation
deployment activities throughout the region. It is intended that these logos
and slogans, and the customizable advertising and promotional materials on
which they appear, can be accepted and used by both public and private sector
technology participants to foster cooperation and accelerate awareness,
understanding and support among the public at large. To the extent possible,
the creation of these materials is financed by the private sector.
<A ID="E11E8" NAME="E11E8"></A>
<P>
<B><U>Information Distribution and Industry Networking Support</U></B>
<P>
In its unique technology-neutral position, The Partnership has created a
breakthrough, advertising-supported, consumer friendly Web Site which
individually showcases each technology. The interactive site encourages feedback
from stakeholders and, as a clearinghouse of information, provides networking
opportunities between manufacturers/service providers and
purchasers/implementors. It is organized into fifteen sub-home pages for
quick access and maneuverability:

<P>
Since The Partnership works closely with all the stakeholders in each of
the five advanced transportation technologies, it has become a de facto
clearinghouse of ATT information. In this capacity, it is uniquely suited
to direct and introduce interested participants to other stakeholders with
similar goals and into the formation of productive and mutually beneficial
public/private partnerships. <A ID="E9E4" NAME="E9E4"></A>
<P>

  <B>LONG-TERM MEASURES</B>

<P>
Implementation of the long-term measures in the 1997 AQMP depends on advances
and breakthroughs that are expected over the next 13 years. This requires
aggressive research and development efforts which have been ongoing at the
District and other state and federal agencies.
<P>
As outlined in Chapter 4, achieving clean air standards in the South Coast
area requires the application of advanced technologies. The District's Technology
Advancement Office (TAO) sponsors public-private research and development
partnerships in order to identify and promote low- and zero-emissions
technologies for both stationary and mobile sources. The Mobile Source Air
Pollution Reduction Review Committee (MSRC) which was established in 1990
with the adoption of Assembly Bill 2766, funds projects to reduce air pollution
from motor vehicles also supports related planning, monitoring, enforcement,
and technical studies as needed for implementing the California Clean Air
Act of 1988.
<P>
Table 7-5 lists some key recently-completed or currently-underway projects
sponsored by the TAO to facilitate development and commercialization of
low-polluting technologies. Table 7-6 lists recently completed or current
projects sponsored by the MSRC to reduce mobile source emissions. Tables
7-5 and 7-6 are the specific long-term measures associated with the projects.
Some of the stationary source projects do not have specific linkages to the
long-term measures but serve as future technologies that may be available
to meet current regulations with future compliance dates or short- and
intermediate-term AQMP control measures.
<P>
The AQMP proposes an incentive program to encourage the use of fuel cell
technology. The 1994 AQMP also created a fuel cell implementation task force
whose role is to: (1) identify specific areas and goals for fuel
cell<STRIKE>s</STRIKE> application, (2) investigate infrastructure needs
for the development of fuel cells, and (3) suggest mechanisms to accomplish
the goal of expediting the commercial implementation of fuel cells in the
Basin. The task force is led by the District and comprised of representatives
of potential interested and affected parties in the Basin and fuel cell
manufacturers. The overall goal of the task force is to provide incentives
for people to utilize and perhaps manufacture fuel cells in the Basin.
<P>
Table 7-7 lists the targeted implementation schedule for the proposed long
term measures. To ultimately achieve full implementation of the advanced
technologies, control methods and market mechanisms proposed in this Plan,
numerous agencies will need to develop and follow implementation schedules.
These agencies, as well as the District, may need to seek additional legal
authority and resources, including funding, to carry out some of the activities
for which they are responsible.

  <B>IMPLEMENTATION SUPPORT ACTIVITIES</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
Implementation of the 1997 AQMP will require support activities sponsored
by the District and SCAG. These efforts are described in the following
subsections. <A ID="E10E6" NAME="E10E6"></A>
<P>
<B>District Assistance and Outreach Programs</B>
<P>
Since the adoption of the 1991 AQMP the District has provided assistance
to the agencies charged with implementing the Plan. A key accomplishment
was the District's CEQA Air Quality Handbook to assist local governments
in assessing and mitigating air quality impacts from projects within their
jurisdiction.
<P>
An important ongoing outreach program is the Interagency AQMP Implementation
Committee (IAIC). The IAIC provides ongoing coordination between key local
government entities and the District Board as the AQMP is implemented. Some
objectives of the IAIC include:
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>
    Identifying how local governments throughout the region should interact with
    the District to ensure implementation of the AQMP.
    <P>
  <LI>
    Identifying and resolving issues that could affect timely implementation
    of the AQMP.
    <P>
  <LI>
    Assisting the District in developing and carrying out its local government
    outreach program to ensure that local government information, technical,
    and policy input needs are met.
    <P>
  <LI>
    Determining how local governments should be involved in the AQMP implementation
    update process.
    <P>
  <LI>
    Developing a structure for identifying, analyzing, and resolving potential
    conflicts between air quality and other regional goals.
</UL>
<P>
The IAIC also established a Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) which provides
technical input on AQMP programs and policies, and suggested issues relating
to AQMP implementation for the IAIC to discuss.
<P>
Through the IAIC and TAC, the District is better able to facilitate and
coordinate the implementation efforts of the local agencies in the Basin.
<A ID="E10E7" NAME="E10E7"></A>
<P>
<B>Business Assistance</B>
<P>
The District has initiated several programs to assist businesses that must
comply with the requirements promulgated in the Plan. For the 1997 AQMP,
these efforts will be continued and strengthened. Several of the District's
assistance programs are highlighted below.
<P>
Through the District's "New Directions" campaign, several programs have been
developed and implemented to assist the regulated community. These programs
include: permit streamlining practices, interaction with small and medium-sized
businesses, source education programs, compliance assessment programs and
the continued implementation of the Small Business Assistance and Economic
Development and Business Retention offices.
<P>
The Public Advisor assures business input to the District's policy makers
through community workshops, industry-specific meeting, and ethnic business
working groups. Fee Review and other technical assistance helps companies
resolve issues in a cooperative manner.
<P>
The District's Small Business Assistance office helps owners/operators
participate in the District's policy and rule development process and helps
them comply with applicable requirements. It offers permit application and
processing assistance as well as compliance and financial assistance.
<P>
The Air Quality Assistance Fund (AQAF) is one of the Small Business Assistance
office's many functions. The District established this program to assist
small businesses within its jurisdiction needing financial help to purchase
air pollution control equipment. The loan guarantee may be approved for up
to 90 percent of the loan amount, ranging from a minimum of $15,000 to a
maximum of $250,000. The AQAF has enabled a number of businesses to obtain
equipment financing which might not otherwise have been able to obtain credit
and meet start-up costs.
<P>
The District created the Economic Development and Business Retention (EDBR)
office in 1992 in response to the economic downturn experienced by the nation
and particularly in Southern California. The primary objective of the Economic
Development and Business Retention office is to facilitate the commercialization
of new low-emitting technologies. This creates jobs and helps to retain existing
businesses through introduction of and conversion to more efficient and
less-polluting technologies. The EDBR office has already helped approximately
500 companies with their compliance goals and has thus far helped to create
or retain an estimated 6000 or more jobs in Southern California.
<A ID="E10E8" NAME="E10E8"></A>
<P>
<B>SCAG Assistance</B>
<P>
SCAG has provided significant assistance and outreach to local governments
in understanding, assessing and implementing programs to address TCM and
air quality issues. Beginning in early 1993, SCAG has provided funding to
its thirteen subregions to help develop policies and strategies and prepare
monitoring programs which address TCMs, air quality and mobilityrequirements--identifying locally sensitive implementation options and continuing
to develop monitoring programs to report progress.
<P>
In cooperation with the District, SCAG helped create The Partnership and
the REACH Task Force as discussed previously in this chapter. SCAG continues
in an active role to implement new strategies to improve air quality and
mobility. <A ID="E9E6" NAME="E9E6"></A>
<P>

  <B>MONITORING</B>

<P>
The 1997 AQMP sets the course for attaining the federal and state air quality
standards in the Basin. As the Plan is implemented, it is essential to
periodically assess the effectiveness of the air pollution control programs
in reducing emissions, and to determine whether or not the Basin is still
proceeding along the course set forth in the AQMP. Monitoring the AQMP's
effectiveness will also be an integral part of preparing the annual rule
work plan. The monitoring report will provide the necessary information to
monitor fifteen percent over three years reductions requested by the CCAA,
with for maximum feasible measures and expeditious adoption schedule required
by the CCAA.
<P>
It is equally important that the people who live and work in the Basin be
kept informed of the efforts being undertaken to improve air quality, and
of the extent to which air quality is improving as a result. The monitoring
report can provide this kind of feedback to the Basin's residents.
<P>
Monitoring the effectiveness of the AQMP is required by the CCAA (Health
and Safety Code Sections 40924) and federal Clean Air Act (Part D, Section
172). Specifically, the CCAA requires that the District prepare and submit
a report each year to the ARB summarizing the Basin's progress in meeting
the schedules for developing, adopting, or implementing the air pollution
control measures contained in the Plan.
<P>
Every third year, the District is required to assess the overall effectiveness
of its air quality program, including determining the quality of emission
reductions achieved, and the rate of population and industrial- and
vehicular-related emissions growth compared to the assumptions and goals
contained in the Plan. The District is also required to assess the extent
of air quality improvement, based upon ambient pollutant measurements and
best available modeling techniques. These reports are required by law to
be adopted by the District at a public hearing and to be transmitted to the
ARB.
<P>
The federal Clean Air Act also requires nonattainment areas, such as the
Basin, to document "reasonable further progress" in achieving incremental
reductions of air pollution.
<P>
SCAG, with the assistance of county transportation commissions and subregions,
prepares the portion of the monitoring reports that pertain to local government
transportation and land use measures and submits those portions to the District
for inclusion in the full monitoring reports.

The 1990 federal Clean Air Act revised the planning requirements for many
areas that have not attained National Ambient Air Quality Standards. The
South Coast Air Quality Management District (District) has jurisdiction over
the South Coast Air Basin (Basin), and the desert portions of Los Angeles
and Riverside counties in the Mojave Desert Air Basin and Salton Sea Air
Basin, respectively (see Figure 1-1). The Antelope Valley, located in the
desert portion of Los Angeles county, and the Coachella Valley, located in
the desert portion of Riverside county, both exceed the federal ozone standard.
The Antelope Valley is unclassified for PM<SUB>10</SUB>. The Coachella Valley
has attained the federal PM<SUB>10</SUB> standards and a maintenance plan
is currently being developed as a separate plan.
<P>
The federal Clean Air Act requires that the Antelope Valley and Coachella
Valley:
<UL>
  <P>
  &#183; identify specific emission reduction goals;
  <P>
  &#183; demonstrate reasonable further progress in VOC emission reductions;
  <P>
  &#183; demonstrate attainment of the federal ozone standard by November 15,
  2007; and
  <P>
  &#183; provide contingency measures or actions in the event of a failure
  to attain or to meet interim milestones.
</UL>
<P>
This AQMP revision addresses these requirements and satisfies the State
Implementation Plan requirements under Title I of the Clean Air Act (CAA).
<P>
<B><A NAME="Statement of Problem">STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</A></B>
<P>
There are a number of circumstances that are unique to the Antelope and Coachella
valleys which make it difficult to develop a local control strategy that
satisfies CAA requirements. For example, with little in the way of local
emissions, and with the significant growth projected for both desert areas
it is difficult to satisfy the reasonable further progress requirements of
the CAA. There is strong evidence that pollutant transport from the South
Coast Air Basin to the Antelope and Coachella valleys is the primary cause
of the ozone nonattainment status of both areas. As a result, the District
believes that aggressive control of the South Coast Air Basin emissions is
an effective strategy to substantially improve air quality in the Antelope
and Coachella valleys. Each of these issues is addressed in further detail
below.
<P>
<B>Regulatory Requirements</B>
<P>
State Implementation Plan requirements under Title I of the CAA depend on
the severity of the nonattainment problem. For the Antelope Valley and the
Coachella Valley, the CAA requirements for moderate through severe areas
must be addressed. Thus, the areas are subject to the reasonable further
progress requirements of the CAA, as discussed in Chapter 6 for the South
Coast Air Basin; these requirements are intended to ensure that each ozone
nonattainment area provide for sufficient VOC emission reductions to attain
the ozone national ambient air quality standard. These requirements are more
difficult to meet for areas with low existing emissions and significant
population growth, since the VOC reductions are relative to the 1990 emissions
and activity levels. For example, the CAA requires three percent VOC emission
reductions beginning in 1997. If an area experiences population growth such
that VOC emissions increase by 15 percent over 1990 levels, then the area
must develop regulations that achieve VOC reductions of at least 18 percent
(i.e., the 3 percent rate-of-progress requirement plus the 15 percent increase
from population growth). The expected population growth for the Antelope
and Coachella valleys is significant; thus the rate-of-progress requirements
of the CAA cannot be met for either area unless further local controls are
implemented.
<P>
The CAA also requires that "severe-17" ozone nonattainment areas, such as
the Antelope and Coachella valleys, demonstrate attainment of the federal
ozone air quality standard by November 15, 2007 using a U.S. EPA-recommended
photochemical grid model and EPA-approved modeling techniques. The South
Coast Air Basin modeling domain, as shown in Figure 8-1, was expanded to
include the Antelope Valley and Coachella Valley so that this CAA requirement
could be addressed. It is clear from available data that federal ozone standard
exceedances in the Antelope and Coachella valleys largely result from pollutant
transport from the upwind South Coast Air Basin. Photochemical grid modeling
for the 1994 AQMP, using the U.S. EPA-approved Urban Airshed Model, shows
that attainment of the ozone standard is possible with the proposed control
strategy described in the 1994 AQMP for the South Coast Air Basin, and control
of locally generated emissions via state and federal regulations. This Plan
carries forward the 1994 AQMP control approach for the Antelope and Coachella
valleys.
<P>
<B>Population Growth</B>
<P>
Both the Antelope Valley and the Coachella Valley are rapidly growing areas,
as shown in Table 8-1. By 2020, the population in the Antelope Valley is
expected to nearly triple from 1990 levels and the Coachella Valley population
is projected to more than double. It is clearly more challenging to meet
the rate-of-progress requirements of the CAA in such rapidly growing areas.

  <B>Pollutant Transport</B>
</H2>
<P>
The following pollutant transport pathways from the South Coast Air Basin
to the Mojave Desert and Salton Sea air basins have been identified: 1) through
Newhall Pass to the Antelope Valley; and 2) through Banning Pass to the Coachella
Valley. <FONT SIZE=-3><I> <A HREF="#noteone">{1}</A> </I></FONT> The transport pathway to the Coachella
Valley has been an intensely studied phenomenon. An experiment to study this
transport pathway concluded that the South Coast Air Basin was the source
of the observed high oxidant levels in the Coachella Valley.
<FONT SIZE=-3><I></I><A HREF="#note2"> {2}</A></FONT> Transport from Anaheim to Palm Springs was
directly identified with an inert sulfur hexafluoride tracer release
<FONT SIZE=-3><I><A HREF="#note3">{3}</A>  </I></FONT> . The most comprehensive study to date of
transport from the South Coast Air Basin to the Mojave Desert and Salton
Sea air basins confirmed the transport pathways to both Antelope and Coachella
valleys.<FONT SIZE=-3><I><A HREF="#note4">{4}</A></I></FONT>
<P>
Ozone pollutant transport to the Antelope and Coachella valleys can be
demonstrated by examining ozone exceedance frequencies as a function of distance
from the source areas. Figures 8-2 and 8-3, respectively, show the frequency
of exceedances of the federal one-hour ozone standard by hour for the period
1991 to 1995. Figure 8-2 represents the transport route to the Antelope Valley
beginning at the primary source region of downtown Los Angeles through Burbank
and Santa Clarita and ending at Lancaster in the Antelope Valley. The Coachella
Valley transport route is represented in Figure 8-3, starting at Pico Rivera
near the source region and passing through Fontana and Banning and finally
through Banning Pass to Palm Springs in the Coachella Valley. Note in both
figures that near the source region exceedances occur most frequently at
mid-day (noon to 1:00 p.m.) during the peak of incoming solar radiation and
therefore the peak of ozone production. As one goes downwind of the source
region, exceedances occur later and later in the day as the ozone cloud is
transported downwind. For example, at Lancaster exceedances occur most frequently
at 3:00 to 4:00 p.m. and Palm Springs exceedances occur most frequently at
6:00 p.m. If these peaks were locally generated they would be occurring near
mid-day and not in the late afternoon or early evening.

<P>
Ozone is transported these long distances at fairly high concentrations for
two reasons. Control of VOCs in the South Coast Air Basin has caused the
location of the daily maximum ozone to move eastward; thus more pollutants
which have not reacted are carried to greater distances. The other reason
is that ozone concentrations can remain high during transport to the desert
due to lack of local nitric oxide sources, which prevents ozone loss by nitric
oxide scavenging.
<P>
Table 8-2 compares the 1993 emission inventories of the South Coast Air Basin
with those for the Antelope Valley and the Coachella Valley. The South Coast
Air Basin emissions, upwind of the Antelope and Coachella valleys, overwhelm
the locally-generated emissions. Depending on the pollutant, emissions in
the South Coast Air Basin are 11 (for PM<SUB>10</SUB>) to 99 (for
SO<SUB>x</SUB>) times greater than emissions in the Antelope Valley and 5
(for PM<SUB>10</SUB>) to 50 (for SO<SUB>x</SUB>) times greater than emissions
in the Coachella Valley. It is clear that improved air quality in these areas
depends on reduced emissions in the South Coast Air Basin. This is illustrated
by the trends in ozone air quality described in the following section.

Ozone air quality trends since 1980 are shown in Figures 8-4 and 8-5 for
stations along the Antelope and Coachella Valley transport routes, respectively.
The statistic used here to illustrate trends is the average of the 30 highest
daily maximum one-hour ozone concentrations in each year, referred to as
the "Top 30 Mean." This statistic has been identified and recommended by
the ARB <FONT SIZE=-3><I><A HREF="#note5">{5}</A></I></FONT> as a good trend indicator. Over this
time period population growth in the Antelope and Coachella valleys was much
greater than that in the South Coast Air Basin, as shown in Table 8-2. Since
emissions are directly related to population for many source categories,
emissions growth was also greater in the Antelope and Coachella valleys relative
to the South Coast Air Basin. However, the downward trend in the Top 30 Means
at Lancaster and Palm Springs parallels the trend of the upwind stations
which are in the South Coast Air Basin. This observation confirms the conclusion
that ozone air quality in the Antelope and Coachella valleys is largely due
to transport from the upwind source region of the South Coast Air Basin and
that attainment in the valleys is only possible with emission reductions
in the Basin.

Figures 8-6 and 8-7 illustrate just how effective the District's control
strategy has been in reducing the number of federal one-hour ozone exceedances
in the Antelope and Coachella valleys since 1980. The number of exceedance
days by month in 1980, 1985, 1990, and 1995 for Lancaster and Palm Springs
are shown in Figures 8-6 and 8-7, respectively. Both the number of days per
month exceeding the standard and the number of months in which exceedances
are observed have dropped dramatically since 1980. In 1980, Lancaster experienced
exceedances in eight months of the year and Palm Springs experienced exceedances
in seven months of the year. By 1995, the number of months with exceedances
had dropped to only three months.

Air quality modeling is an integral part of the planning process to achieve
clean air. The CAA requires that ozone nonattainment areas designated as
serious and above be required to use a photochemical grid model to demonstrate
attainment. The photochemical grid model (or air quality simulation model)
recommended by the U.S. EPA for ozone analyses is the Urban Airshed Model
with the Carbon Bond Mechanism IV chemistry (UAM). UAM is an urban-scale,
three-dimensional, grid-type, numerical simulation model. It is designed
for computing ozone concentrations under short-term, episodic conditions
lasting one to three days. UAM is also the recommended model for ozone analysis
by the ARB.
<P>
It is desirable to perform ozone air quality analyses using several different
meteorological episodes. Chapter 5 describes the meteorological episodes
used to project future air quality. Performance evaluations of the four
meteorological episodes are discussed in Technical Report V-B of the 1994
AQMP.
<P>
Future-year air quality projections in the Antelope and Coachella valleys
are presented in detail in Appendix V; the results are summarized in Figure
8-8 for the Antelope Valley and Figure 8-9 for the Coachella Valley. The
peak predicted ozone concentrations are shown for the baseline and controlled
2007 simulations for each of the four meteorological episodes modeled. "Baseline"
assumes no further control beyond existing rules and regulations and "Control"
assumes implementation of the proposed control strategy described in Chapters
4 and 7. As illustrated, the federal ozone standard, shown by a solid horizontal
line at 12 pphm in the figures, will be exceeded in one of the four episodes
in the Antelope Valley and in two of the four episodes in the Coachella Valley
if the AQMP control is not implemented. However, with the implementation
of the control strategy, the federal one-hour ozone standard is attained
for all four episodes in both the Antelope and Coachella valleys. However,
the peak ozone concentration in the Antelope Valley is projected to be 12.2
pphm. While the projected ozone air quality is above the federal ozone air
quality standard in 2007, the area is expected to attain by 2010 (see Chapter
5 and Appendix V). The U.S. EPA transport policy allows a downwind area to
delay attainment to the same date of the upwind area if the upwind area
contributes significantly to the exceedances. Future AQMP revisions will
continue to evaluate ozone transport using more updated meteorological episodes
which better represent transport into the Antelope Valley.

The reasonable further progress requirements in the CAA are intended to ensure
that each ozone nonattainment area provide for sufficient precursor emission
reductions to attain the ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard. More
specifically, Section 182(c)(2) requires that each serious and above ozone
nonattainment area achieve actual VOC emission reductions of at least three
percent per year averaged over each consecutive 3-year period beginning six
years after enactment of the Act until the area's attainment date (i.e.,
November 15, 2007 for the Antelope and Coachella valleys). This is called
the "post-1996 rate-of-progress" requirement of the CAA.

</CENTER>
<P>
According to Section 182(c)(2)(C), actual NO<SUB>x</SUB> emission reductions
which occur after 1990 can be used to meet post-1996 VOC emission reduction
requirements provided the NO<SUB>x</SUB> reductions satisfy the following
criteria. First, the control strategy used to demonstrate attainment must
consist of both VOC and NO<SUB>x</SUB> control measures. More specifically,
the mix of VOC and NO<SUB>x</SUB> emission reductions used to satisfy the
post-1996 rate-of-progress requirements of the CAA must be consistent with
the controlled VOC and NO<SUB>x</SUB> emission levels used in the modeling
demonstration. And lastly, the combined annual VOC and NO<SUB>x</SUB> reductions
must average 3 percent per year.
<P>
As mentioned a number of times in this chapter, poor ozone air quality in
the Antelope and Coachella valleys is primarily due to transport of ozone
and its precursors from the upwind source region of the South Coast Air Basin
and attainment in these downwind valleys is only possible with substantial
emission reductions in the Basin. With this in mind, the proposed control
strategy consists of two components: 1) an aggressive control strategy for
VOC and NO<SUB>x</SUB> emission sources in the South Coast Air Basin; and
2) control of locally generated emissions via proposed control measures
implemented by state and federal actions.
<P>
The District's approach to satisfying the post-1996 rate-of-progress requirement
is presented in Appendix V; Figures 8-10 (Antelope Valley) and 8-11 (Coachella
Valley) summarize the results. At each milestone year (1999, 2002, 2005,
and 2007) the following VOC and NO<SUB>x</SUB> emission levels are shown:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  &#183; the target level (termed "Target Level" in the figures);
  <P>
  &#183; the projected uncontrolled baseline (termed "Projected Baseline" in
  the figures); and
  <P>
  &#183; the controlled emissions - statewide mobile and stationary control
  measures and control
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
measures for federally regulated sources (termed "Controlled Emissions" in
the figures).
<P>
The rate-of-progress results for the Antelope Valley are shown in Figure
8-10. The proposed reduction rates by milestone year are shown in Table 8-3.
These rates were determined by applying all the creditable VOC reductions
at each milestone and providing sufficient NO<SUB>x</SUB> reductions to satisfy
the VOC emission reduction requirements of Section 182(c)(2). Comparing the
baseline emissions with the target levels for each milestone year indicates
that additional emission reductions are necessary to achieve target levels
as illustrated in Table 8-10.

The rate-of-progress requirements are satisfied for all milestone years through
a combination of VOC and NO<SUB>x</SUB> reductions, except that for 1999
there is a greater level of NO<SUB>x</SUB> substitution than is allowed by
the CAA. However, according to Section 182(c)(2)(B)(ii) of the CAA, the District
may be permitted to achieve VOC emission reductions less than 3 percent per
year if it demonstrates that the Plan includes:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  &#183; all measures that, given technological achievability, can feasibly
  be implemented in the area, and
  <P>
  &#183; all measures that are achieved in practice by sources in the same
  category in nonattainment areas of the next higher classification (extreme
  in this instance).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The District will request this "waiver" to the post-1996 rate-of-progress
requirements for the Antelope Valley. The District believes that the area
meets the waiver clause conditions.
<P>
As shown in Figure 8-11, the VOC and NO<SUB>x</SUB> emission reductions from
existing District and ARB rules are sufficient to meet the CAA rate-of-progress
requirements for the Coachella Valley. The VOC emission reductions in the
baseline are almost sufficient to meet the requirements for the 1999 milestone
year. The NO<SUB>x</SUB> reductions in the projected baseline are more than
sufficient to make up for the VOC shortfall in 1999. The rate-of-progress
requirements for all subsequent milestone years (i.e., 2002, 2005, and 2007)
are met by a combination of VOC and NO<SUB>x</SUB> reductions from existing
District and ARB rules. The proposed reduction rates by milestone year are
shown in Table 8-4. The control strategy provides additional VOC and
NO<SUB>x</SUB> reductions for all the years beginning with 1999. The projected
emission reductions beyond the target levels can be used as contingency in
the event of a milestone failure.

<P>
The Coachella Valley is currently designated nonattainment for
PM<SUB>10</SUB>. Unlike the Basin, where PM<SUB>10</SUB> exceedances are
due primarily to PM<SUB>10</SUB> precursor pollutants, the Coachella Valley's
elevated PM<SUB>10</SUB> levels are strongly tied to local fugitive dust
problems. Accordingly, instead of relying on District rulemaking to achieve
attainment, previous planning documents have proposed local control to meet
the area's air quality objectives. This approach allows local Coachella Valley
governments, industry, and citizens to take an active part in improving the
Valley's air quality. As a result of this approach, various local dust control
programs and two District "backstop" rules have been developed. These programs
have resulted in significant improvements in the Valley's air quality.
  <HR ALIGN=CENTER>
<B>Background</B>
<P>
Under the 1990 federal Clean Air Act (CAA), the Coachella Valley was originally
designated as a "moderate" PM<SUB>10</SUB> nonattainment area. In response
to CAA requirements for "moderate" areas, the District developed the "State
Implementation Plan for PM<SUB>10</SUB> in the Coachella Valley" (90-CVSIP)
which was adopted by the Governing Board in November 1990. The 90-CVSIP proposed
implementation of reasonably available control measures (RACM) for fugitive
dust sources no later than December 10, 1993. Modeling contained in the 90-CVSIP
demonstrated attainment of the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS)
for PM<SUB>10</SUB> would occur by December 31, 1995, one year after the
statutory limit for moderate nonattainment areas.
<P>
The CAA specifies that any area which cannot attain the standards by December
1994 would subsequently be reclassified as a "serious" nonattainment area.
In January 1993, the U.S. EPA completed its initial redesignation process,
and included the Coachella Valley among five nationwide areas redesignated
as "serious," effective February 8, 1993. The CAA further specifies that
a SIP revision is due within 18 months of the redesignation date (i.e., August
8, 1994) and that a demonstration of attainment must be submitted within
four years of the redesignation date (i.e., February 8, 1997). Among other
requirements, the "serious" area SIP must ensure the implementation of "best
available control measures" (BACM). The District prepared and later adopted
the 1994 Coachella Valley PM<SUB>10</SUB> SIP revision (94-CVSIP) in July
of 1994.

<P>
  <HR WIDTH=100% ALIGN=LEFT>
<P>
Under the CAA, an area can be redesignated as attainment if, among other
requirements, the U.S. EPA determines that the NAAQS have been attained.
Section 175A of the CAA states that any district that submits a request under
Section 107(d) for redesignation of a nonattainment area to attainment must
submit a revision of the applicable SIP that demonstrates attainment for
at least 10 years after the redesignation. U.S. EPA guidance states that
a determination of compliance with the NAAQS must be based on three complete,
consecutive calendar years of quality-assured air quality monitoring data
<FONT SIZE=-3><I><A HREF="#note6">{6}</A></I> </FONT>. Air quality is monitored at two locations
in the Coachella Valley and results indicate that there were no
PM<SUB>10</SUB> exceedances in 1993 or 1994. In 1995, the 24-hour standard
was exceeded once and this led to an exceedance of the annual average standard.
This exceedance occurred on a day where the maximum hourly wind gusts exceeded
50 mph for each hour of the day.
<P>
The U.S. EPA has recently developed a natural events policy
<FONT SIZE=-3><I><A HREF="#note7">{7}</A></I> </FONT> that permits, under certain circumstances,
the exclusion of air quality data attributable to uncontrollable natural
events (e.g., volcanic activity, wildland fires, and high wind events). With
the exclusion of air quality data from the one 24-hour exceedance in 1995,
the Coachella Valley has experienced three consecutive years without an
exceedance of the PM<SUB>10</SUB> standards and, consequently, would be eligible
for redesignation to attainment. Based on the supporting meteorological data
regarding the one high wind event in 1995, the District is preparing a
maintenance plan for the Coachella Valley. In accordance with U.S. EPA guidance,
the major elements of the plan are as follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  &#183; a demonstration of attainment with the PM<SUB>10</SUB> standards based
  on the three most recent years of ambient data;
  <P>
  &#183; a maintenance plan, including contingency measures, to ensure continued
  attainment for the next ten years; and
  <P>
  &#183; a Natural Events Action Plan pursuant to the Natural Events Policy.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The Coachella Valley Maintenance plan will be prepared as a separate document.
It will be released for public review and submitted to the U.S. EPA in lieu
of the attainment demonstration prior to February 8, 1997.

<P>
The Antelope Valley and the Coachella Valley are designated as "severe-17"
ozone nonattainment areas and as such must demonstrate reasonable further
progress and attainment according to federal Clean Air Act requirements.
The District's proposed control strategy includes two components: a strategy
for the South Coast Air Basin as described in Chapter 4 and control of locally
generated emissions in the Antelope Valley and Coachella Valley via regulations
at the state and federal level. Photochemical grid modeling, using a U.S.
EPA-approved model and methodologies, demonstrates that the federal one-hour
ozone standard will be met by November 15, 2007 for the Coachella Valley
as required by the CAA. However, the federal ozone air quality standard will
be met in the Antelope Valley by 2010. For PM<SUB>10</SUB>, the Antelope
Valley is an unclassified area with no current planning requirements; for
the Coachella Valley, a PM<SUB>10</SUB> maintenance plan will be submitted
with a request to U.S. EPA for redesignation to attainment status.

<P>This Chapter presents additional analyses which have important future considerations, but which are not currently required under law to be included in the AQMP.  The District has attempted to anticipate certain future federal requirements and local needs and has incorporated this information into the 1997 AQMP.  Among the anticipated needs is the development of an emissions inventory for the year 2020 for long-term federal transportation conformity purposes, and other information in anticipation of federal changes regarding PM<SUB>10</SUB> and ozone ambient air quality standards.  By including anticipated future requirements, the District is providing a preview of future technical considerations and possible planning  implications.
<P><B><a name="Conformity Constraints">CONFORMITY CONSTRAINTS</B>
<P>Since the release of the Federal Transportation Conformity Requirements in 1993, transportation and air quality planning efforts have become increasingly interdependent.  The Federal Transportation Conformity Regulations require that transportation conformity determinations demonstrate that proposed transportation projects come from a conforming transportation plan and conforming transportation improvement program.  In order to be deemed in conformance, the transportation plan and program must demonstrate conformity with the emissions budgets contained in the current SIP.
<P>An emissions budget is the future-year emissions forecast, after control, in a control strategy SIP.  An emissions budget is tied to the area&#146;s carrying capacity and is allocated by specific source category such as stationary sources.  Carrying capacity is defined as the maximum level of emissions which enable the attainment and maintenance of an ambient air quality standard for a pollutant.
<P>The CAAA requires that SIPs contain an emissions budget which represents the remaining emissions levels after the implementation of control measures that achieve the applicable milestones and attainment.  The emissions budget is developed  as part of the AQMP/SIP process.  Required emissions budgets were presented in earlier chapters for key years through 2010.  Due to federal transportation planning requirements, the current transportation plan extends to the year 2020 or 10 years beyond the AQMD&#146;s planning timelines through 2010.  It therefore becomes necessary for the AQMP to contain a special emissions budget for the year 2020.  If this were not accomplished, the regional transportation plan could not demonstrate conformity, and transportation projects could not move forward to receive federal funding, permits or approvals of any kind.  Model applications were extended though 2020 to develop the carrying capacity for that year.  Model results are presented in Figure 10-1.following emissions budget estimates are based on these results for 2020.

<B><a name="Potential New Air Quality  Standards for Ozone">POTENTIAL NEW AIR QUALITY STANDARDS FOR OZONE AND FINE PARTICULATES</B>
<P>During the timeframe for development of the 1997 AQMP, the U.S. EPA is reviewing the current air quality standards for ozone and particulate matter.  As part of the requirements of the CAA, every five years the U.S. EPA must review the current ambient air quality standards and propose revisions where necessary.  This review process includes a comprehensive evaluation of the latest health studies; a redrafting, if appropriate, of the relevant pollutant criteria document; and a staff report recommending the position of the U.S. EPA staff.  Both the criteria document and the staff report are reviewed by the CAA-authorized Clean Air Science Advisory Committee (CASAC), an independent panel of experts.  Generally, for the U.S. EPA to proceed with the new air quality standard setting process, consensus approval must first be given by CASAC on both the criteria document and the staff report.  At this point in time, these actions have occurred.
<P>In the current process, both ozone and fine particulates are being considered for new standards.  The U.S. EPA in June 1996 issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR) regarding possible new ambient air quality standards for ozone and fine particulates.  In the ANPR, U.S. EPA announced that proposed action would be issued in November 1996.  Should the proposed action include recommendations for new standards, then final action would occur in June 1997.  If new standards are proposed, a new set of planning requirements will also be proposed.  Under the CAA, for new standards, new plans must be developed within three to six years from the date of final promulgation.
<p> <B>Health Basis</B> 
<p>The U.S. EPA recently completed a review of the scientific and technical information on the known and potential adverse health effects of ozone and PM<SUB>10</SUB> because results from recent studies have suggested that attainment of the existing NAAQS for these pollutants may not provide adequate public health protection.  A brief summary of the effects associated with these pollutant exposures at levels observable in Southern California is presented.  A more detailed discussion of health effects is provided in Appendix I.
<P><B><U>Ozone</U></B>
<P>People exercising outdoors, children and persons with preexisting lung disease such as asthma are considered to be susceptible sub-groups for ozone effects.  Identified in human and/or animal studies with varying exposure duration the adverse health effects which are either induced by ozone or associated with ambient ozone exposures include: breathing pattern changes; reduction in breathing capacity and exercise performance; increase in airway resistance; susceptibility to infections; excess hospital admissions and emergency room visits; and acute inflammation of the respiratory tract including some cellular changes.
<P>The lowest range of ozone exposure within which lung functional changes (decrease in breathing lung volumes and increase in airway resistance) are observed is 0.08 to 0.12 ppm for 6-8 hours under moderate exercising conditions.  Under similar exposure conditions, biochemical indicators of lung inflammation are induced in healthy adults exposed to ozone in the range of 0.08 to 0.10 ppm.  Excess hospital admissions and emergency room visits are observed when hourly ozone concentrations are as low as 0.08 to 0.10 ppm.  Thus, the attainment of the current NAAQS (0.12 ppm) is not likely to prevent all the adverse effects  indicated from ozone exposure. 
<P><B><U>Particulate Matter</U></B>
<P>The major categories of adverse health effects associated with PM<SUB>10</SUB> include: increase in mortality associated with acute and chronic exposures; exacerbation of preexisting respiratory and cardiovascular diseases leading to an increase in hospital admissions and emergency room visits; school absences; work loss days and restricted activity days; changes in lung function and structure; and altered lung defense mechanisms.  
<P>A review and statistical analysis of recent population studies published on acute adverse effects of PM<SUB>10</SUB> indicates that an incremental increase of PM<SUB>10</SUB> by 10 &#181;g/m<SUP>3</SUP> can lead to a significant increase in both mortality and morbidity risks.  The elderly, people with preexisting respiratory and/or cardiovascular disease(s) and children appear to be most susceptible to the effects of PM<SUB>10</SUB>.  These findings suggest that even when an area meets the existing NAAQS for PM<SUB>10</SUB> the community is likely to continue to have the adverse impact from ambient PM<SUB>10</SUB> exposures.  
<P>A limited number of studies which have employed both PM<SUB>10</SUB> and PM<SUB>2.5</SUB> indices for pollution suggest that the adverse effects show a better correlation with the latter.  A growing consensus exists among the scientific community that the fine fraction of PM<SUB>10</SUB> is relatively more toxic than the coarse fraction and is responsible for the majority of PM<SUB>10</SUB> effects observed.
<P>In addition, U.S. EPA in its recent PM<SUB>10</SUB> NAAQS review has concluded that the difference in exposure relationships, and the strong likelihood of fine mode fraction of PM<SUB>10</SUB> being significant contributors to PM-related health effects in sensitive populations, are sufficient to justify the consideration of fine and coarse mode particles in PM<SUB>10</SUB> as separate classes of pollutants.  Hence, U.S. EPA  has recommended additional PM<SUB>2.5</SUB> NAAQS.
<p><B>Assessment of Potential New Standards</B>

<P><B><U>Ozone </U></B>
<P>The U.S. EPA is considering replacing the current 1-hour federal ozone standard of 0.12 ppm with an 8-hour standard.  At this time, U.S. EPA is considering the level of the standard to be in the range of 0.07 to 0.09 ppm, with the most likely value at 0.08 ppm.  In addition, U.S. EPA is considering a change in the form of the standard, from an exceedance-based to a concentration-based form.  Under this scenario, if the 5th highest 8-hour average, as averaged over the three most recent years of record, is above 0.08 ppm, then the area would be deemed to be in violation of the standards.  U.S. EPA is also considering the 2nd highest 8-hour average, averaged over three years, and if the 2nd highest value is below 0.08 ppm, then an area will be deemed to be in attainment of the standard.  What happens if an area records values between these two bands has not been specifically delineated.
<P>The District has evaluated the differences between the current 1-hour standard and the possible 8-hour standard for both 1995 (actual) and 2010 (projected).  These are summarized in Table 10-2.  Currently, the 1-hour standards are exceeded by 116 percent.  The maximum 8-hour would exceed the possible new standard by 155 percent.  Future year projections show that the 1-hour standard would be met in 2010, but the maximum 8-hour standard would still be exceeded by 35 percent.  Because federal guidance has not yet been developed for modeling attainment demonstrations of a 5th highest value, a projection of this value cannot be made at this time.
<P><B><U>Particulate Matter</U></B>
<P>The U.S. EPA is currently recommending that new fine particulate standards be established at a cut-point of 2.5 micrometers (PM<SUB>2.5</SUB>).  The latest recommendations would establish a PM<SUB>2.5   </SUB>annual average at a value between 12.5 and 20 &#181;g/m<SUP>3</SUP>, and a PM<SUB>2.5</SUB> 24-hour average at a value between 18 and 65 &#181;g/m<SUP>3</SUP>.  The PM<SUB>10</SUB> annual average is likely to be retained, but the 24-hour PM<SUB>10</SUB> standard may be deleted.

<P>A comparison of the current PM<SUB>10</SUB> standards and the possible new PM<SUB>2.5</SUB> standards for 1995 and 2006 are shown in Table 10-3.  The 1995 values are derived from the measurements taken during the PTEP study; the 2006 PM<SUB>2.5</SUB> values are estimated from the PM<SUB>10</SUB> model application coupled with PM<SUB>10</SUB>-to-PM<SUB>2.5</SUB> conversion factors applied on a component basis, as derived from the PTEP data.  Currently, the PM<SUB>10</SUB> standards are exceeded by 38 percent, and attainment can be demonstrated by 2006.  If the new PM<SUB>2.5</SUB> standards are promulgated, the PM<SUB>2.5</SUB> annual standard in 2006 with the current control strategy would be exceeded by 25 percent at the upper (or least stringent) end of the range, while the 24-hour average would be exceeded by 54 percent at the upper end of the range.  At the lower end of the range (most stringent), the percent above standards would be 200 percent for the annual average, and 456 percent for the 24-hour average.
<P>It is also important in looking into the future to understand the significant components of PM<SUB>2.5</SUB> as projected for the year 2006.  These are shown in Figure 10-2.  The ammonium and nitrate portions represent the dominant fraction of PM<SUB>2.5</SUB> on both an annual and episodic (24-hour) basis.  Note, too, that the crustal component, as identified within the category labeled &quot;others,&quot; and which represents a significant fraction of PM<SUB>10</SUB>, plays a very small role in the PM<SUB>2.5</SUB> picture.  For the 24-hour standard, it is evident that significant reductions in ammonium nitrate will be needed over and above the current PM<SUB>10</SUB> control strategy in order to attain a possible PM<SUB>2.5</SUB> standard.  Appreciable reductions will also be needed for both organic and elemental carbon, the former from VOC emissions and the latter from soot emissions, primarily from diesel exhaust.

<P>With any new standard, U.S. EPA provides &quot;interim&quot; guidance on the transition from the old to the new standard.  To better address the concerns and implications of a transition policy as well as other implementation issues regarding ozone, fine particulates, and regional haze, U.S. EPA has assembled an advisory committee under the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA).  The FACA Committee represents over 50 representatives from state and local air regulatory agencies, industry, environmental organizations, consulting organizations, academia, and federal agencies.  In addition, four subgroups have been formed to focus on: (1) Base Programs and Policies; (2) National and Regional Strategies; (3) Science and Technology; and (4) Communications and Outreach.  In addition, a Coordination work group integrates the results from the subgroups.  It is anticipated that U.S. EPA will rely on the FACA process in developing new guidance and policies should new standards be promulgated.  The District staff are actively participating/following the subgroup activities to ensure consideration of South Coast Air Basin conditions.

<H3><A NAME="81">INTRODUCTION
</H3>

<P>
<A NAME="temp4">The 1990 federal Clean Air Act revised the planning
requirements for many areas that have not attained National Ambient
Air Quality Standards. The South Coast Air Quality Management
District (District) has jurisdiction over the South Coast Air
Basin (Basin), and the desert portions of Los Angeles and Riverside
counties in the Mojave Desert Air Basin and Salton Sea Air Basin,
respectively (see Figure 1-1). However, AB 2666 (Knight) created
the Antelope Valley Air Pollution Control District beginning on
July 1, 1997. Until then, the District will continue to address
the planning requirements for the Antelope Valley. The Antelope
Valley, located in the desert portion of Los Angeles county, and
the Coachella Valley, located in the desert portion of Riverside
county, both exceed the federal ozone standard. The Antelope Valley
is unclassified for PM10. The Coachella Valley has attained the
federal PM10 standards and a maintenance plan is currently being
developed as a separate plan.</A> 
<P>
The federal Clean Air Act requires that the Antelope Valley and
Coachella Valley:
<UL>
<LI>identify specific emission reduction goals;
<LI>demonstrate reasonable further progress in VOC emission reductions;
<LI>demonstrate attainment of the federal ozone standard by November
15, 2007; and
<LI>provide contingency measures or actions in the event of a
failure to attain or to meet interim milestones.
</UL>

<P>
This AQMP revision addresses these requirements and satisfies
the State Implementation Plan requirements under Title I of the
Clean Air Act (CAA).
<H3><a name = "82">STATEMENT
OF PROBLEM</H3>

<P>
There are a number of circumstances that are unique to the Antelope
and Coachella valleys which make it difficult to develop a local
control strategy that satisfies CAA requirements. For example,
with little in the way of local emissions, and with the significant
growth projected for both desert areas it is difficult to satisfy
the reasonable further progress requirements of the CAA. There
is strong evidence that pollutant transport from the South Coast
Air Basin to the Antelope and Coachella valleys is the primary
cause of the ozone nonattainment status of both areas. As a result,
the District believes that aggressive control of the South Coast
Air Basin emissions is an effective strategy to substantially
improve air quality in the Antelope and Coachella valleys. Each
of these issues is addressed in further detail below.
<p><b>Regulatory
Requirements</b>

<P>
State Implementation Plan requirements under Title I of the CAA
depend on the severity of the nonattainment problem. For the Antelope
Valley and the Coachella Valley, the CAA requirements for moderate
through severe areas must be addressed. Thus, the areas are subject
to the reasonable further progress requirements of the CAA, as
discussed in Chapter 6 for the South Coast Air Basin; these requirements
are intended to ensure that each ozone nonattainment area provide
for sufficient VOC emission reductions to attain the ozone national
ambient air quality standard. These requirements are more difficult
to meet for areas with low existing emissions and significant
population growth, since the VOC reductions are relative to the
1990 emissions and activity levels. For example, the CAA requires
three percent VOC emission reductions beginning in 1997. If an
area experiences population growth such that VOC emissions increase
by 15 percent over 1990 levels, then the area must develop regulations
that achieve VOC reductions of at least 18 percent (i.e., the
3 percent rate-of-progress requirement plus the 15 percent increase
from population growth). The expected population growth for the
Antelope and Coachella valleys is significant; thus the rate-of-progress
requirements of the CAA cannot be met for either area unless further
local controls are implemented.
<P>
The CAA also requires that &quot;severe-17&quot; ozone nonattainment
areas, such as the Antelope and Coachella valleys, demonstrate
attainment of the federal ozone air quality standard by November
15, 2007 using a U.S. EPA-recommended photochemical grid model
and EPA-approved modeling techniques. The South Coast Air Basin
modeling domain, as shown in Figure 8-1, was expanded to include
the Antelope Valley and Coachella Valley so that this CAA requirement
could be addressed. It is clear from available data that federal
ozone standard exceedances in the Antelope and Coachella valleys
largely result from pollutant transport from the upwind South
Coast Air Basin. Photochemical grid modeling for the 1994 AQMP,
using the U.S. EPA-approved Urban Airshed Model, shows that attainment
of the ozone standard is possible with the proposed control strategy
described in the 1994 AQMP for the South Coast Air Basin, and
control of locally generated emissions via state and federal regulations.
This Plan carries forward the 1994 AQMP control approach for the
Antelope and Coachella valleys.
<p><b>Population
Growth</b>

<P>
Both the Antelope Valley and the Coachella Valley are rapidly
growing areas, as shown in Table 8-1. By 2020, the population
in the Antelope Valley is expected to nearly triple from 1990
levels and the Coachella Valley population is projected to more
than double. It is clearly more challenging to meet the rate-of-progress
requirements of the CAA in such rapidly growing areas.

<b><A NAME="_Toc358778889"></A><A NAME="_Toc358779387"></A>Pollutant
Transport</b>

<P>
The following pollutant transport pathways from the South Coast
Air Basin to the Mojave Desert and Salton Sea air basins have
been identified: 1) through Newhall Pass to the Antelope Valley;
and 2) through Banning Pass to the Coachella Valley. The transport
pathway to the Coachella Valley has been an intensely studied
phenomenon. An experiment to study this transport pathway concluded
that the South Coast Air Basin was the source of the observed
high oxidant levels in the Coachella Valley. Transport from Anaheim
to Palm Springs was directly identified with an inert sulfur hexafluoride
tracer release. The most comprehensive study to date of transport
from the South Coast Air Basin to the Mojave Desert and Salton
Sea air basins confirmed the transport pathways to both Antelope
and Coachella valleys.
<P>
Ozone pollutant transport to the Antelope and Coachella valleys
can be demonstrated by examining ozone exceedance frequencies
as a function of distance from the source areas. Figures 8-2 and
8-3, respectively, show the frequency of exceedances of the federal
one-hour ozone standard by hour for the period 1991 to 1995. Figure
8-2 represents the transport route to the Antelope Valley beginning
at the primary source region of downtown Los Angeles through Burbank
and Santa Clarita and ending at Lancaster in the Antelope Valley.
The Coachella Valley transport route is represented in Figure
8-3, starting at Pico Rivera near the source region and passing
through Fontana and Banning and finally through Banning Pass to
Palm Springs in the Coachella Valley. Note in both figures that
near the source region exceedances occur most frequently at mid-day
(noon to 1:00 p.m.) during the peak of incoming solar radiation
and therefore the peak of ozone production. As one goes downwind
of the source region, exceedances occur later and later in the
day as the ozone cloud is transported downwind. For example, at
Lancaster exceedances occur most frequently at 3:00 to 4:00 p.m.
and Palm Springs exceedances occur most frequently at 6:00 p.m.
If these peaks were locally generated they would be occurring
near mid-day and not in the late afternoon or early evening.
<P>
<center><B>FIGURE 8-2</B> 
<P><IMG SRC="8-2.gif"><br>
Frequency of Federal Ozone Exceedances Along the Antelope Valley
Transport Route,
1991-95</center>
<P>
Ozone is transported these long distances at fairly high concentrations
for two reasons. Control of VOCs in the South Coast Air Basin
has caused the location of the daily maximum ozone to move eastward;
thus more pollutants which have not reacted are carried to greater
distances. The VOC control program in the South Coast Air Basin
has reduced VOC emissions to the extent that photochemical reaction
rates of formation of ozone have also slowed. Greater amounts
of emissions (although, overall, these emissions are lower) are
transported downwind as a result. In addition, ozone formed in
the South Coast Air Basin could remain above the standards during
transport in the downwind areas since there are fewer oxides of
nitrogen sources to react with ozone during the nighttime hours.
<P>
Table 8-2 compares the 1993 emission inventories of the South
Coast Air Basin with those for the Antelope Valley and the Coachella
Valley. The South Coast Air Basin emissions, upwind of the Antelope
and Coachella valleys, overwhelm the locally-generated emissions.
Depending on the pollutant, emissions in the South Coast Air Basin
are 11 (for PM10) to 99 (for SOx) times greater than emissions
in the Antelope Valley and 5 (for PM10) to 50 (for SOx) times
greater than emissions in the Coachella Valley. It is clear that
improved air quality in these areas depends on reduced emissions
in the South Coast Air Basin. This is illustrated by the trends
in ozone air quality described in the following section.

Trends in Ozone Air Quality
<P>
Ozone air quality trends since 1980 are shown in Figures 8-4 and
8-5 for stations along the Antelope and Coachella Valley transport
routes, respectively. The statistic used here to illustrate trends
is the average of the 30 highest daily maximum one-hour ozone
concentrations in each year, referred to as the &quot;Top 30 Mean.&quot;
This statistic has been identified and recommended by the ARB
as a good trend indicator. Over this time period population growth
in the Antelope and Coachella valleys was much greater than that
in the South Coast Air Basin, as shown in Table 8-2. Since emissions
are directly related to population for many source categories,
emissions growth was also greater in the Antelope and Coachella
valleys relative to the South Coast Air Basin. However, the downward
trend in the Top 30 Means at Lancaster and Palm Springs parallels
the trend of the upwind stations which are in the South Coast
Air Basin. This observation confirms the conclusion that ozone
air quality in the Antelope and Coachella valleys is largely due
to transport from the upwind source region of the South Coast
Air Basin and that attainment in the valleys is only possible
with emission reductions in the Basin.

Figures 8-6 and 8-7 illustrate just how effective the District's
control strategy has been in reducing the number of federal one-hour
ozone exceedances in the Antelope and Coachella valleys since
1980. The number of exceedance days by month in 1980, 1985, 1990,
and 1995 for Lancaster and Palm Springs are shown in Figures 8-6
and 8-7, respectively. Both the number of days per month exceeding
the standard and the number of months in which exceedances are
observed have dropped dramatically since 1980. In 1980, Lancaster
experienced exceedances in eight months of the year and Palm Springs
experienced exceedances in seven months of the year. By 1995,
the number of months with exceedances had dropped to only three
months.

<P>
Air quality modeling is an integral part of the planning process
to achieve clean air. The CAA requires that ozone nonattainment
areas designated as serious and above be required to use a photochemical
grid model to demonstrate attainment. The photochemical grid model
(or air quality simulation model) recommended by the U.S. EPA
for ozone analyses is the Urban Airshed Model with the Carbon
Bond Mechanism IV chemistry (UAM). UAM is an urban-scale, three-dimensional,
grid-type, numerical simulation model. It is designed for computing
ozone concentrations under short-term, episodic conditions lasting
one to three days. UAM is also the recommended model for ozone
analysis by the ARB.
<P>
It is desirable to perform ozone air quality analyses using several
different meteorological episodes. Chapter 5 describes the meteorological
episodes used to project future air quality. Performance evaluations
of the four meteorological episodes are discussed in Technical
Report V-B of the 1994 AQMP.
<P>
Future-year air quality projections in the Antelope and Coachella
valleys are presented in detail in Appendix V; the results are
summarized in Figure 8-8 for the Antelope Valley and Figure 8-9
for the Coachella Valley. The peak predicted ozone concentrations
are shown for the baseline and controlled 2007 simulations for
each of the four meteorological episodes modeled. &quot;Baseline&quot;
assumes no further control beyond existing rules and regulations
and &quot;Control&quot; assumes implementation of the proposed
control strategy described in Chapters 4 and 7. As illustrated,
the federal ozone standard, shown by a solid horizontal line at
12 pphm in the figures, will be exceeded in one of the four episodes
in the Antelope Valley and in two of the four episodes in the
Coachella Valley if the AQMP control is not implemented. However,
with the implementation of the control strategy, the federal one-hour
ozone air quality standard is attained for all four episodes in
both the Antelope and Coachella valleys.

<P>
The reasonable further progress requirements in the CAA are intended
to ensure that each ozone nonattainment area provide for sufficient
precursor emission reductions to attain the ozone National Ambient
Air Quality Standard. More specifically, Section 182(c)(2) requires
that each serious and above ozone nonattainment area achieve actual
VOC emission reductions of at least three percent per year averaged
over each consecutive 3-year period beginning six years after
enactment of the Act until the area's attainment date (i.e., November
15, 2007 for the Antelope and Coachella valleys). This is called
the &quot;post-1996 rate-of-progress&quot; requirement of the
CAA.
<P><center>
<B>FIGURE 8-9</B> 
<P><IMG SRC="8-9.gif"><br>
Maximum Predicted Ozone Concentrations for 2007 in the Coachella
Valley With and Without Implementation of the 1997 AQMP Control
Strategy</center>
<P>
According to Section 182(c)(2)(C), actual NOx emission reductions
which occur after 1990 can be used to meet post-1996 VOC emission
reduction requirements provided the NOx reductions satisfy the
following criteria. First, the control strategy used to demonstrate
attainment must consist of both VOC and NOx control measures.
More specifically, the mix of VOC and NOx emission reductions
used to satisfy the post-1996 rate-of-progress requirements of
the CAA must be consistent with the controlled VOC and NOx emission
levels used in the modeling demonstration. And lastly, the combined
annual VOC and NOx reductions must average 3 percent per year.<A NAME="_Toc358778892"></A>
<P>
<A NAME="_Toc358779390">As mentioned a number of times in this
chapter, poor ozone air quality in the Antelope and Coachella
valleys is primarily due to transport of ozone and its precursors
from the upwind source region of the South Coast Air Basin and
attainment in these downwind valleys is only possible with substantial
emission reductions in the Basin. With this in mind, the proposed
control strategy consists of two components: 1) an aggressive
control strategy for VOC and NOx emission sources in the South
Coast Air Basin; and 2) control of locally generated emissions
via proposed control measures implemented by state and federal
actions.</A> 
<P>
The District's approach to satisfying the post-1996 rate-of-progress
requirement is presented in Appendix V; Figures 8-10 (Antelope
Valley) and 8-11 (Coachella Valley) summarize the results. At
each milestone year (1999, 2002, 2005, and 2007) the following
VOC and NOx emission levels are shown:
<UL>
<LI>the target level (termed &quot;Target Level&quot; in the figures);
<LI>the projected uncontrolled baseline (termed &quot;Projected
Baseline&quot; in the figures); and
<LI>the controlled emissions - statewide mobile and stationary
control measures and control measures for federally regulated
sources (termed &quot;Controlled Emissions&quot; in the figures).
</UL>

<P>
The rate-of-progress results for the Antelope Valley are shown
in Figure 8-10. The proposed reduction rates by milestone year
are shown in Table 8-3. These rates were determined by applying
all the creditable VOC reductions at each milestone and providing
sufficient NOx reductions to satisfy the VOC emission reduction
requirements of Section 182(c)(2). Comparing the baseline emissions
with the target levels for each milestone year indicates that
additional emission reductions are necessary to achieve target
levels as illustrated in Figure 8-10. However, with the implementation
of the state and federal control measures, the post-1996 rate-of-progress
requirements are satisfied at all milestone years as shown by
the controlled emission levels in Figure 8-10.

<H3><a name = "85">SUMMARY OF COACHELLA VALLEY PM10 PLAN</H3>

<b>Introduction</b>

<P>
The Coachella Valley is currently designated nonattainment for
PM10. Unlike the Basin, where PM10 exceedances are due primarily
to PM10 precursor pollutants, the Coachella Valley's elevated
PM10 levels are strongly tied to local fugitive dust problems.
Accordingly, instead of relying on District rulemaking to achieve
attainment, previous planning documents have proposed local control
to meet the area's air quality objectives. This approach allows
local Coachella Valley governments, industry, and citizens to
take an active part in improving the Valley's air quality. As
a result of this approach, various local dust control programs
and two District &quot;backstop&quot; rules have been developed.
These programs have resulted in significant improvements in the
Valley's air quality.<P>
<b>Background</b>

<P>
Under the 1990 federal Clean Air Act (CAA), the Coachella Valley
was originally designated as a &quot;moderate&quot; PM10 nonattainment
area. In response to CAA requirements for &quot;moderate&quot;
areas, the District developed the &quot;State Implementation Plan
for PM10 in the Coachella Valley&quot; (90-CVSIP) which was adopted
by the Governing Board in November 1990. The 90-CVSIP proposed
implementation of reasonably available control measures (RACM)
for fugitive dust sources no later than December 10, 1993. Modeling
contained in the 90-CVSIP demonstrated attainment of the national
ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for PM10 would occur by
December 31, 1995, one year after the statutory limit for moderate
nonattainment areas.
<P>
The CAA specifies that any area which cannot attain the standards
by December 1994 would subsequently be reclassified as a &quot;serious&quot;
nonattainment area. In January 1993, the U.S. EPA completed its
initial redesignation process, and included the Coachella Valley
among five nationwide areas redesignated as &quot;serious,&quot;
effective February 8, 1993. The CAA further specifies that a SIP
revision is due within 18 months of the redesignation date (i.e.,
August 8, 1994) and that a demonstration of attainment must be
submitted within four years of the redesignation date (i.e., February
8, 1997). Among other requirements, the &quot;serious&quot; area
SIP must ensure the implementation of &quot;best available control
measures&quot; (BACM). The District prepared and later adopted
the 1994 Coachella Valley PM10 SIP revision (94-CVSIP) in July
of 1994.<p>
<b>1997 PM10 Maintenance Plan</b>

<P>
Under the CAA, an area can be redesignated as attainment if, among
other requirements, the U.S. EPA determines that the NAAQS have
been attained. Section 175A of the CAA states that any district
that submits a request under Section 107(d) for redesignation
of a nonattainment area to attainment must submit a revision of
the applicable SIP that demonstrates attainment for at least 10
years after the redesignation. U.S. EPA guidance states that a
determination of compliance with the NAAQS must be based on three
complete, consecutive calendar years of quality-assured air quality
monitoring data. Air quality is monitored at two locations in
the Coachella Valley and results indicate that there were no PM10
exceedances in 1993 or 1994. In 1995, the 24-hour standard was
exceeded once and this led to an exceedance of the annual average
standard. This exceedance occurred on a day where the maximum
hourly wind gusts exceeded 50 mph for each hour of the day.
<P>
The U.S. EPA has recently developed a natural events policy that
permits, under certain circumstances, the exclusion of air quality
data attributable to uncontrollable natural events (e.g., volcanic
activity, wildland fires, and high wind events). With the exclusion
of air quality data from the one 24-hour exceedance in 1995, the
Coachella Valley has experienced three consecutive years without
an exceedance of the PM10 standards and, consequently, would be
eligible for redesignation to attainment. Based on the supporting
meteorological data regarding the one high wind event in 1995,
the District is preparing a maintenance plan for the Coachella
Valley. In accordance with U.S. EPA guidance, the major elements
of the plan are as follows:
<UL>
<LI>a demonstration of attainment with the PM10 standards based
on the three most recent years of ambient data;
<LI>a maintenance plan, including contingency measures, to ensure
continued attainment for the next ten years; and
<LI>a Natural Events Action Plan pursuant to the Natural Events
Policy.
</UL>

<P>
The Coachella Valley Maintenance plan will be prepared as a separate
document. It will be released for public review and submitted
to the U.S. EPA in lieu of the attainment demonstration prior
to February 8, 1997.
<H3><a name = "86">CONCLUSIONS
</H3>

<P>
The Antelope Valley and the Coachella Valley are designated as
&quot;severe-17&quot; ozone nonattainment areas and as such must
demonstrate reasonable further progress and attainment according
to federal Clean Air Act requirements. The District's proposed
control strategy includes two components: a strategy for the South
Coast Air Basin as described in Chapter 4 and control of locally
generated emissions in the Antelope Valley and Coachella Valley
via regulations at the state and federal level. Photochemical
grid modeling, using a U.S. EPA-approved model and methodologies,
demonstrates that the federal one-hour ozone standard will be
met by November 15, 2007 for the Coachella Valley as required
by the CAA. However, the federal ozone air quality standard will
be met in the Antelope Valley by 2010. For PM10, the Antelope
Valley is an unclassified area with no current planning requirements;
for the Coachella Valley, a PM10 maintenance plan will be submitted
with a request to U.S. EPA for redesignation to attainment status.

<H3><a name = "11">PURPOSE</H3>

<P>
The purpose of the 1997 Revision to the Air Quality Management
Plan (AQMP or Plan) for the South Coast Air Basin (Basin) and
those portions of the Mojave Desert Air Basin and Salton Sea Air
Basin under the South Coast Air Quality Management District (District)
jurisdiction, is to set forth a comprehensive program that will
lead these areas into compliance with all federal and state air
quality planning requirements. Specifically, the 1997 AQMP Revision
is designed to satisfy: 1) the State Implementation Plan requirements
under Title I of the federal Clean Air Act (CAA) and 2) the California
Clean Air Act (CCAA). These federal and state requirements are
summarized briefly later in this chapter.
<P>
The 1997 AQMP sets forth programs which require the cooperation
of all levels of government: local, regional, state, and federal.
Each level is represented in the Plan by the appropriate agency
or jurisdiction that has the authority over specific emissions
sources. Accordingly, each agency or jurisdiction is assigned
specific planning and implementation responsibilities.
<P>
At the federal level, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) is charged with regulation of on-road motor vehicle standards;
trains, airplanes, and ships; non-road engines; and off-shore
oil development. The Air Resources Board (ARB), representing the
state level, also oversees on-road vehicle emission standards,
fuel specifications, some off-road sources and consumer product
standards. At the regional level, the District is responsible
for stationary sources and some mobile sources. In addition, the
District has lead responsibility for the development and adoption
of the Plan. Lastly, at the local level, Associations of Governments
have a dual role of leader and coordinator. In their leadership
role, they, in cooperation with local jurisdictions and subregional
associations, develop strategies for these jurisdictions to implement;
as a coordinator, they facilitate the implementation of these
strategies. For the South Coast Air Basin, the Southern California
Association of Governments is the District's major partner in
the preparation of the AQMP. Interagency commitment and cooperation
are the keys to success of the AQMP.
<P>
Since air pollution physically transcends city and county boundaries,
it is a regional problem. No one agency can design or implement
the Plan alone, and the strategies in the Plan reflect this fact.
<H3><a name = "12">CONSTRAINTS IN ACHIEVING STANDARDS </H3>

<P>
The District is faced with a number of constraints or confounding
circumstances to achieving clean air. These include the physical
and meteorological setting, the large pollutant emissions burden
of the Basin, and the rapid population growth of the area.
<p><b>Setting</b>

<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District has jurisdiction
over approximately 12,000 square miles consisting of the four-county
South Coast Air Basin and the Los Angeles county and Riverside
county portions of what used to be under state classification
the Southeast Desert Air Basin. Figure 1-1 shows the boundaries
of the District; also shown are the federally designated ozone
nonattainment areas. In May 1996, the boundaries of the South
Coast Air Basin were changed by ARB to include the Beaumont-Banning
area. In addition, the Southeast Desert Air Basin was separated
into two areas and renamed as the Mojave Desert Air Basin and
the Salton Sea Air Basin. The South Coast Air Basin is bounded
by the Pacific Ocean to the west and the San Gabriel, San Bernardino,
and San Jacinto Mountains to the north and east. It includes all
of Orange county and the non-desert portions of Los Angeles, Riverside,
and San Bernardino counties. The Los Angeles county portion of
the Mojave Desert Air Basin (known as North county or Antelope
Valley) is bounded by the San Gabriel Mountains to the south and
west, the Los Angeles/Kern county border to the north, and the
Los Angeles/San Bernardino county border to the east. In September
1996, AB 2666 (Knight) established the Antelope Valley Air Pollution
Control District (AVAPCD) to be effective on July 1, 1997. In
the interim, the Antelope Valley is considered part of the South
Coast Air Quality Management District. As such, the planning requirements
for the Antelope Valley are provided in this Plan. The Riverside
county portion of the Salton Sea Air Basin and the Mojave Desert
Air Basin is bounded by the San Jacinto Mountains in the west
and spans eastward up to the Palo Verde Valley (Blythe).
<P>
While the state action redrew the boundaries of the desert regions
of Southern California, the federal ozone nonattainment area is
still called the Southeast Desert Modified Ozone Nonattainment
Area and contains portions from all three air basins. The Salton
Sea Air Basin portion of Riverside County east of the South Coast
Air Basin (known as the Coachella Valley Planning Area) is bounded
by the San Jacinto Mountains to the west and the eastern boundary
of the Coachella Valley to the east.
<P>
The topography and climate of Southern California combine to make
the Basin an area of high air pollution potential, and constrain
the District's efforts to achieve clean air. During the summer
months, a warm air mass frequently descends over the cool, moist
marine layer produced by the interaction between the ocean's surface
and the lowest layer of the atmosphere. The warm upper layer forms
a cap over the cool marine layer and inhibits the pollutants in
the marine layer from dispersing upward. In addition, light winds
during the summer further limit ventilation. Furthermore, sunlight
triggers the photochemical reactions which produce ozone, and
this region experiences more days of sunlight than any other major
urban area in the nation except Phoenix.

[Note: A New District (Antelope Valley Air Pollution Control District)
was Formed in September 1996 and Will Be Effective on July 1,
1997.]</center>
<P>
The Basin's economic base is diverse. Historically, the four counties
of the Basin have collectively comprised one of the fastest-growing
local economies in the United States. Until recently, the aerospace
and electronic industries accounted for about 20 percent of the
Basin's employment. Significant changes have occurred in the composition
of the industrial base of the region in the past ten years. As
in many areas of the country, a large segment of heavy manufacturing,
including steel and tire manufacturing and automobile assembly,
has been phased down. The aerospace and electronics industries
have been reduced in scale by cutbacks in defense spending. Small
service industries and businesses resulting from growth in shipping
and trade have replaced much of the heavy industry.
<P>
Both the Antelope Valley and the Coachella Valley Planning Area
are impacted by pollutant transport from the South Coast Air Basin.
In addition, pollutant transport occurs to the Mojave Desert,
Ventura county, and San Diego county. As part of this AQMP revision,
transport issues relative to the Antelope Valley and the Coachella
Planning Area are specifically addressed in Chapter 8 and Appendix
V.
<P>
In summary, the diverse geographical characteristics of the Southern
California region place a significant constraint on achieving
air quality standards.<p>
<b>Emission Sources</b>

<P>
The pollution burden of the Basin is substantial. It has been
estimated from prior studies that emissions of volatile organic
compounds, oxides of nitrogen, carbon monoxide, sulfur oxides,
and direct primary particulates in the South Coast Air Basin must
be reduced by over 50 percent to attain the federal air quality
standards.
<P>
Air pollution forms either directly or indirectly from pollutants
emitted from a variety of sources. These sources can be natural,
such as oil seeps, vegetation, or windblown dust. Emissions may
also result from combustion, as in automobile engines; from evaporation
of organic liquids, such as those used in coating and cleaning
processes; or through abrasion, such as from tires on roadways.
The air pollution control strategy in the AQMP is directed almost
entirely at controlling man-made sources. Where naturally occurring
emissions can be mitigated, such as through windbreaks, they are
included. Otherwise, natural emissions are accounted for in the
background and initial conditions data used for the air quality
modeling analysis described in Chapters 5 and 8 and Appendix V.
<p><b>Population</b>

<P>
Since the end of World War II, the Basin has experienced faster
population growth than the rest of the nation. Although growth
has slowed somewhat, the region's population is expected to increase
significantly towards the end of the century and through 2020.
Table 1-1 shows the projected growth based on SCAG's regional
growth forecast.
<P>
Although per-capita emissions have been brought down substantially
in the Basin through 40 years of implementing pollution controls,
increases in the population over that time have made overall emission
reductions more difficult. Many sources, such as automobiles,
have been significantly controlled. However, increases in the
number of sources, particularly those growing proportionally to
population, reduce the potential air quality benefits of new controls.
The net result is that unless significant steps are taken to further
control air pollution, growth will overwhelm much of the improvements
expected from the existing control program.

<H3><a name = "13">CONTROL EFFORTS</H3>

<b>History</b>

<P>
The seriousness of the local air pollution problem was recognized
in the early 1940s. In 1946, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors
established the first air pollution control district in the nation
to address the problems of industrial air pollution. In the mid-1950s,
California established the first state agency to control motor
vehicle emissions. Countywide or regional air pollution districts
were required throughout the state by 1970. Many of the controls,
originating in California, became the basis for the federal control
program which began in the 1960s.
<P>
Nearly all control programs developed to date have relied on the
development and application of cleaner technology and add-on emission
control devices. Industrial and vehicular sources have been significantly
affected by this technology. Only recently have preventive efforts
come to the forefront of the air pollution control program, [e.g.,
alternative materials, waste minimization, and maintenance procedures
for industrial sources].
<P>
In the 1970s, it became apparent at both the state and federal
levels that local programs were not enough to solve a problem
that was regional in nature and did not stay within jurisdictional
boundaries. Instead, air basins, defined by geographical boundaries,
became the basis for regulatory programs.
<P>
In 1976, the California Legislature adopted the Lewis Air Quality
Management Act which created the South Coast Air Quality Management
District from a voluntary association of air pollution control
districts in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, and San Bernardino
counties. The new agency was charged with developing uniform plans
and programs for the region to attain federal standards by the
dates specified in federal law. The agency was also mandated to
meet state standards by the earliest date achievable, using reasonably
available control measures.
<P>
Rule development in the 1970s and 1980s resulted in dramatic improvement
in Basin air quality (see Appendix II). However, the effort to
impose incremental rule changes on the thousands of stationary
sources under District permits was laborious and time consuming.
The District concluded it was possible that the limits of the
command and control regulatory process were being reached. The
1991 AQMP introduced the concept of a Marketable Permits Program
and outlined the skeleton of an idea that was forerunner to what
is now known as the Regional Clean Air Incentives Market (RECLAIM).
<P>
A historical milestone occurred with the adoption of RECLAIM on
October 15, 1993. RECLAIM is an alternative means of achieving
further emission reductions from stationary sources, different
from the traditional source-specific regulatory program. RECLAIM
calls for declining mass emission limits on the total emissions
from all sources within a facility. The facility can choose from
a selection of methods for achieving the prescribed emission reductions:
add-on controls, use of reformulated products, changes in production,
purchase of excess emission reductions from other sources, and/or
any other methods that would be enforceable and quantifiable.
At the time of adoption, RECLAIM was estimated to affect approximately
390 and 41 of the largest emitters of oxides of nitrogen and oxides
of sulfur in the Basin and is designed to reduce emissions of
these pollutants by 80 and 14 tons/day, respectively, by July
1, 2004.1<P>
<b>Impact of Control</b>

<P>
Past air quality programs have been effective in improving the
Basin's air quality. Ozone levels have been reduced in half over
the past 30 years, sulfur dioxide and lead standards have been
met, and other criteria pollutant concentrations have significantly
declined. And for the first time in 1992, the federal annual nitrogen
dioxide standard was not exceeded in the Basin. However, the Basin
still experiences exceedances of health-based standards for ozone,
carbon monoxide, and particulate matter under ten microns (PM10).
Air quality summaries and health effects in the Basin are briefly
discussed in Chapter 2; Appendix II provides an in-depth analysis
of air quality as measured within the District's jurisdiction.
<H3><a name = "14">1994 AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT PLAN</H3>

<P>
In September 1994, the District and SCAG adopted an Air Quality
Management Plan for the Basin which revised the previous AQMPs.
The 1994 AQMP continued an aggressive emission control program
with primary emphasis on mobile sources. The control program consists
of short- and intermediate-term control measures and long-term
(or new technology) measures. The long-term control measures would
be implemented after 2000 to achieve the federal ozone air quality
standard by 2010. The 1994 AQMP proposed a comprehensive set of
control measures that included market incentive approaches for
stationary sources, introduction of market incentive concepts
that could replace indirect source control measures, and the use
of advanced technologies for stationary and mobile sources. The
need to build the infrastructure for new mobile source technologies
was also identified.
<P>
The 1994 AQMP addressed specific requirements of the 1990 federal
Clean Air Act and the state Clean Air Act. Specifically, the 1994
AQMP provided an ozone attainment demonstration as required in
the 1990 federal Clean Air Act and served as the triennial report
update for the South Coast Air Basin as required under state law.
Upon the adoption of the 1994 AQMP, the District Governing Board
requested that only those control measures necessary to the federal
ozone air quality standard be forwarded to the U.S. EPA as part
of the ozone State Implementation Plan (SIP).<p>
<b>State and Federal Approval Actions on the 1994 AQMP</b>

<P>
Subsequent to the adoption of the 1994 AQMP, the California Air
Resources Board (ARB) took actions to approve the 1994 AQMP as
part of the California Ozone SIP. In November 1994, the ARB approved
the California Ozone SIP and replaced many of the AQMP mobile
source control measures with statewide mobile measures. In addition,
ARB replaced the AQMP consumer products and pesticide control
measures with statewide measures. All of the statewide measures
provide equivalent emission reductions to those replaced AQMP
measures. The California Ozone SIP was forwarded to the U.S. EPA
on November 15, 1994 and a completeness finding was made on April
18, 1995.
<P>
The U.S. EPA proposed two actions on the California Ozone SIP.
The first action on August 21, 1995, approved several of the long-term
new technology measures in the Ozone SIP and several of the statewide
mobile source control measures. On March 8, 1996, the U.S. EPA
proposed actions to approve the California Ozone SIP. The proposed
actions were finalized on September 26,1996 and will be effective
30 days after publication in the Federal Register. As part of
the final action, U.S. EPA will enter into a consultative process
to further develop the assignment of emission reductions to federal
transportation sources (locomotives, ships, and aircrafts) needed
to achieve the federal ozone air quality standard in the South
Coast Air Basin. The consultative process is anticipated to be
completed by the summer of 1997 and if necessary, a revised ozone
attainment demonstration would be submitted by the end of 1997.
<p><b>Progress in Implementing the 1994 AQMP</b>

<P>
Progress in implementing the 1994 AQMP can be measured by the
number of control measures that have been adopted as rules and
the resulting tons of pollutants targeted for reduction. Since
1994, nine control measures have been adopted by the District
through September 30, 1996. Table 1-2 lists the District stationary
and mobile source control measures from the 1994 AQMP that were
adopted through September 30, 1996.
<P>
The primary focus of the District's efforts had been the development
of the VOC RECLAIM program since 1994. The VOC RECLAIM control
measure (CTS-01) was put on hold by the District Governing Board
in October 1995 due to lack of consensus on major policy issues.
Concurrent actions by the Governing Board placed the substitution
measures identified in the 1994 AQMP as the primary regulatory
program. The District is currently developing regulations to implement
the substitution measures and these measures are discussed in
Chapters 4 and 7.
<P>
Additional rules have been adopted by the ARB to further reduce
emissions from mobile sources and consumer products. In addition,
the Phase 2 reformulated fuels program (known as California Cleaner
Burning Gasoline) began in the spring of 1996 and is projected
to further reduce Basin-wide emissions of volatile organic compounds,
oxides of nitrogen, carbon monoxide, and oxides of sulfur.1

<P>
2 Perchloroethylene has been delisted as a VOC by the U.S. EPA
since the adoption of Rule 1412 and is no longer reported in the
VOC emissions inventory, however, it is still considered a toxic
air contaminant.
<P>
Local governments can play an active role in reducing mobile source
emissions through the implementation of specific actions. Since
1994, a task force jointly chaired by the District and SCAG has
been working on possible on-road pricing market incentive approaches.
The REACH (Reduce Emissions and Congestion on Highways) Task Force
has developed several such approaches for further analysis. The
status of the current efforts is discussed in Chapter 7 and in
Appendix IV.
<P>
The Southern California Economic Partnership (The Partnership)
was established in late 1994 and has been developing approaches
to initiate the development of various infrastructures needed
for alternative fuel programs. A discussion of the progress of
the Partnership is provided in Chapter 7.<P>
<b>Global Warming and Stratospheric Ozone Depletion Policy</b>

<P>
On April 6, 1990, the District adopted a &quot;Policy on Global
Warming and Stratospheric Ozone Depletion.&quot; The Policy commits
the District to consider global impacts in rulemaking and in drafting
revisions to the AQMP.
<P>
In March of 1992, the District's Governing Board reaffirmed this
policy and adopted amendments to the policy to include the following
directives:
<UL>
<LI>phase out the use and corresponding emissions of chlorofluorocarbons
(CFCs), methyl chloroform (1,1,1-trichloroethane or TCA), carbon
tetrachloride, and halons by December 1995;
<LI>phase out the large quantity use and corresponding emissions
of hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) by the year 2000;
<LI>develop recycling regulations for HCFCs;
<LI>develop an emissions inventory and control strategy for methyl
bromide; and
<LI>support for the adoption of a California greenhouse gas emission
reduction goal.
</UL>

<P>
In support of these policies, the District Governing Board has
adopted several rules to reduce ozone depleting compounds. Several
other rules concurrently reduce global warming gases and criteria
pollutants. In the future, these policies will be further implemented
principally through federal actions.<P>
<b>Toxic Air Contaminant Control Programs</b>

<P>
The District is also developing and implementing rules to control
Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPs). These control programs have been
designed to meet federal and state requirements. The District
is required to develop such programs under federal and state law.
<P>
At the federal level, Title III of the Clean Air Act provides
a program for the control of 189 HAPs. The first stage of the
program involves the promulgating of National Emission Standards
for HAPs (NESHAPs) to reduce HAP emissions from new and existing
sources. Major sources will be required to implement Maximum Available
Control Technology (MACT). Area sources will be required to implement
general achievable control technology (GACT). This will be followed
by a second phase in which residual risk will be evaluated and
further controls considered.
<P>
The District will implement the NESHAPs MACT (including the standards)
through its Title V permitting program for major sources or regular
permitting for area sources (EPA has deferred Title V permitting
for area sources for the next five years). The District continually
evaluates its existing rules to determine whether they need to
be amended to meet new MACT standards, or whether new rules need
to be developed.
<P>
At the state level, the California state legislature has enacted
several programs directed at toxic air contaminants (TACs). These
programs include the Tanner Toxics Act (AB 1807), Air Toxics Hot
Spots Assessment Program (AB 2588), Toxic Emissions Near Schools
Program (AB 3205), and Disposal Site Air Monitoring Program (AB
3374). These programs are currently being implemented by the District
either through the District rulemaking, permitting, monitoring
or AB 2588 program.
<P>
The AB 1807 program, in particular, requires ARB to adopt air
toxic control measures (ATCMs) to reduce levels of exposure and
the risks associated with those levels. At present, the District
has developed and is implementing eight rules that control emissions
from specific sources of TACs. These rules meet and in some instances
exceed the requirements set forth in the ATCM. The District will
continue to implement this program through new rulemaking as ARB
adopts additional ATCMs. Currently, under state law, the federal
NESHAPs becomes an ATCM, unless ARB has already adopted an ATCM
for the source category and the hazardous air pollutant(s).
<H3><a name = "15">1997 AQMP REVISION</H3>

<P>
As mentioned earlier in this chapter, this 1997 Revision to the
AQMP is designed to satisfy the planning requirements of both
the Federal Clean Air Act and the California Clean Air Act. The
1994 AQMP is the primary basis for the 1997 AQMP with many of
the 1994 AQMP control measures carried into the 1997 AQMP. A majority
of the 1994 AQMP control measures are updated in terms of the
proposed adoption and implementation schedule.<P>
<b>Federal Clean Air Act Planning Requirements</b>

<P>
In November 1990, Congress enacted a series of amendments to the
Clean Air Act intended to intensify air pollution control efforts
across the nation. One of the primary goals of the 1990 Clean
Air Act Amendments was an overhaul of the planning provisions
for those areas not currently meeting National Ambient Air Quality
Standards (NAAQS). The CAA identifies specific emission reduction
goals, requires both a demonstration of reasonable further progress
and an attainment demonstration, and incorporates more stringent
sanctions for failure to attain or to meet interim milestones.
The discussion that follows briefly presents the general planning
requirements of the CAA, lists previous State Implementation Plan
(SIP) submittals, and introduces CAA provisions that are addressed
in the 1997 AQMP.
<p><b>General Requirements</b>

<P>
In general, the federal CAA does not necessitate significant changes
in attainment planning for the Basin in 1997, except requiring
an attainment plan for PM10. The CAA requires plans to provide
for the implementation of all reasonably available control measures
&quot;as expeditiously as practicable,&quot; including the adoption
of reasonably available control technology for reducing emissions
from existing sources. Emission control innovations in the form
of market-based approaches are explicitly encouraged by the CAA.
As mentioned earlier, the District is the first local agency in
the country to adopt a market-based approach for controlling stationary
source emissions of oxides of nitrogen and sulfur. The CAA also
requires plans to include standards for reasonable further progress,
which is defined as annual incremental reductions in emissions
of relevant air pollutants needed to ensure attainment of the
National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) by the applicable
date. A similar demonstration of progress was instituted in California
with the passage of the California Clean Air Act in 1988. This
is discussed further later in this chapter.
<P>
There are several sets of general planning requirements, both
for nonattainment areas [Section 172(c)] and for implementation
plans in general [Section 110(a)(2)]. These requirements are listed
and very briefly described in Tables 1-3 and 1-4, respectively.
The general provisions apply to all applicable pollutants unless
superseded by pollutant-specific requirements.
<P>
Section 110(a)(2)(A) requires reasonable and enforceable control
measures in plans. EPA has interpreted this requirement to imply
that control measures in a plan be in regulatory form (i.e., adopted
rules) at the time of the plan submittal. However, EPA has the
authority to conditionally approve a plan revision based on a
commitment to adopt specific enforceable measures by not later
than one year after the date of conditional approval of the plan
revision [Section 110(k)(4)].

</PRE>
<HR>

<P>
EPA guidance3 states that regulatory programs tend to be less
than 100 percent effective for many source categories. Rule effectiveness
reflects the ability of a regulatory program to achieve all the
emission reductions that could be achieved by full compliance
with the applicable regulations at all sources at all times. An
effectiveness factor of 80 percent is required by EPA for all
stationary source and non-tailpipe mobile source control measures
for the future controlled scenarios. EPA, however, does allow
exceptions to this rule if data exists to adequately demonstrate
that the &quot;real world&quot; control percentage is higher.
It should be noted that stationary point source controls are nearly
100 percent effective so an assumption of 80 percent rule effectiveness
underestimates the expected emission reductions.
<P>
The CAA requires that most submitted plans include information
on tracking plan implementation and milestone compliance. Requirements
for these elements are described in Section 182(g) and Section
187(d) for ozone and carbon monoxide, respectively. Chapter 7
addresses these issues.
<P>
EPA also requires a public hearing on many of the required elements
in SIP submittals before considering them officially submitted.
The 1997 AQMP adoption process includes a public hearing on all
of the required elements prior to submittal.
<H3>CAA Planning Requirements Addressed by the 1997 AQMP</H3>

<P>
Table 1-5 lists the CAA planning requirements addressed by the
1997 AQMP. The main submittal is a PM10 attainment demonstration
SIP which is due to the U.S. EPA by February 8, 1997. The table
lists the relevant CAA section and submittal deadline along with
the AQMP document or chapter where the submittal is discussed.
It may be used as a reference guide showing where each of the
CAA planning requirements is addressed.
<P>
<A NAME="temp2">Besides the CAA requirements due prior to this
plan revision (i.e., attainment demonstration plans for ozone,
carbon monoxide, and nitrogen dioxide; 1996 Rate-of-Progress and
Post-1996 Rate-of-Progress for ozone; and Best Available Control
Measures (BACM) for PM10), the CAA requires the District to develop
a PM10 attainment demonstration, as given in Section 189.</A>

<P>
As specified in Section 189(b)(1)(A) of the Act, the PM10 attainment
demonstration is due no later than four years after reclassification
of an area to &quot;serious.&quot; The South Coast Air Basin and
the Coachella Valley were reclassified from &quot;moderate&quot;
to &quot;serious&quot; on February 8, 1993. As part of the attainment
demonstration, the plan must also contain emission reduction milestones
to be achieved every three years until the area is redesignated
attainment and the emission reductions must demonstrate reasonable
further progress as defined under Section 171(l) of the Act. The
1997 AQMP is designed to satisfy the requirements of the CAA provisions
for PM10.

<P>
PM10 monitoring data in the Coachella Valley indicate that (with
the exception of one measured PM10 exceedance due to a high-wind
natural event) the area has attained the federal PM10 air quality
standard. The U.S. EPA recently released a natural events policy
which exempts certain high wind events causing PM10 air quality
exceedances as being counted as a violation. In applying this
policy the Coachella Valley is now eligible for consideration
by U.S. EPA as having attained the federal PM10 air quality standards.
The Coachella Valley Maintenance Plan is provided under separate
cover and discussed in Chapter 8 of this document. Certain portions
of this 1997 AQMP will provide supporting documentation to that
maintenance plan.
<P>
With new technical information on emissions estimates, the future-year
baseline emissions projections changed, thereby requiring updates
to previous SIP submittals. In particular, the emission budgets
currently approved for federal conformity purposes must be updated
and the California Ozone SIP for the South Coast Air Basin must
be updated to reflect the best available technical information.
In addition, the Carbon Monoxide Attainment Demonstration Plan
must be revised. As such, the 1997 AQMP provides revisions to
the previous SIP submittals.
<P>
The South Coast Air Basin is the only area in nonattainment of
the federal nitrogen dioxide air quality standard and under the
federal Clean Air Act was to attain the federal air quality standard
by 1995. Monitoring data for the past three years have shown that
the federal nitrogen dioxide concentrations were below the federal
air quality standard. Accordingly, the 1997 AQMP will serve as
the maintenance plan for nitrogen dioxide. As required under Section
175A(a), the plan must provide for maintenance of the air quality
standard for at least 10 years after the area is redesignated
to attainment. In addition, the plan must contain contingency
measures to assure that any violations will be promptly corrected.
<P>
Section 181(a)(1) classifies the Basin as an extreme nonattainment
area and states that the Basin must achieve the federal ozone
standard by November 15, 2010. As such, an attainment demonstration
for ozone was provided as part of the 1994 AQMP and the ozone
portion of the 1994 AQMP is part of the 1994 California Ozone
SIP. The ozone attainment demonstration followed U.S. EPA and
ARB modeling guidelines and as such is based on the photochemical
grid model called the Urban Airshed Model (UAM). The model evaluation
and attainment demonstration are fully presented in Technical
Report V-B and Appendix V-A of the 1994 AQMP, respectively. Based
on new technical information, the 1994 AQMP ozone attainment demonstration
is revised as part of the 1997 AQMP revision and the attainment
demonstration is summarized in Chapters 5 and 6 and Appendix V.
<P>
According to Section 182(c)(2)(B), the District must demonstrate
how the Basin will achieve actual volatile organic compound emission
reductions of at least three percent per year averaged over each
consecutive three-year period beginning from November 15, 1996
and ending November 15, 2010 (i.e., the Basin's attainment date).
The rate-of-progress milestone years for the Basin are 1999, 2002,
2005, 2008, and 2010. Section 182(c)(9) requires that the post-1996
rate-of-progress demonstration must contain a set of contingency
measures, that is, additional control measures which would be
implemented in the event of a milestone or attainment failure.
Appendix V contains the detailed calculations of the post-1996
rate-of-progress demonstration. Chapter 6 provides an estimation
of the emission levels at each of the milestone years compared
to the CAA target levels. Contingency measures are given in Chapter
9.<P>
<b>State Law Requirements</b>

<P>
The California Clean Air Act (CCAA) was signed into law on September
30, 1988, became effective on January 1, 1989, and was amended
in 1992. Also known as the Sher Bill (AB 2595), the CCAA established
a legal mandate to achieve health-based state air quality standards
at the earliest practicable date. The Lewis Presley Act provides
that the plan must also contain deadlines for compliance with
all state ambient air quality standards and the federally mandated
primary ambient air quality standards [Health and Safety Code
(H&amp;SC) 40462(a)]. In September 1996, AB 3048 (Olberg) amended
Sections 40716, 40717.5, 40914, 40916, 40918, 40919, 40920, 40920.5,
and 44241, and repealed Sections 40457, 40717.1, 40925, and 44246
of the Health and Safety Code relating to air pollution. The amendments
to the Health and Safety Code will become effective January 1,
1997. As such, this plan revision reflects the new state planning
requirements as they pertain to the South Coast Air Quality Management
District. Through its many requirements, the CCAA serves as the
centerpiece of the Basin's attainment planning efforts since it
is generally more stringent than the federal Clean Air Act.
<P>
Based on pollutant levels, the CCAA divides nonattainment areas
into categories with progressively more stringent requirements
(H&amp;SC 40918-40920). The categories are outlined in Table 1-6.
The state nonattainment designations are on a county basis. The
entire Basin is an extreme nonattainment area for ozone. Los Angeles
County is the only county considered as a serious nonattainment
area for carbon monoxide. Although PM10 is not explicitly addressed
in the CCAA, it is governed by the Lewis Presley Act. The plan
therefore provides achieving all federal ambient air quality standards
by their applicable date and state ambient air quality standards
as early as possible.

<P>
* Inclusive range.
<P>
Serious and above nonattainment areas are required to revise their
air quality management plan to include specified emission reduction
strategies, and to meet milestones in implementing emission controls
and achieving more healthful air quality. The key planning requirements
are provided in Table 1-7. Some of these requirements are discussed
in further detail in the next section. Chapter 6 addresses how
these requirements are met in the Basin. The CCAA also includes
some additional requirements that can significantly affect control
strategy selection. These requirements are provided in Table 1-8.
All of these mandates have either already been met through District
regulations or are included/considered in the preparation of the
1997 AQMP.<p>
<b>Plan Effectiveness</b>

<P>
The CCAA requires, beginning on December 31, 1994 and every three
years thereafter, that each district demonstrate the overall effectiveness
of its air quality program. For those areas that do not attain
state air quality standards by 2000, a comprehensive plan update
is required to be submitted by December 31, 1997. In addition,
Section 40925 of the Health and Safety Code requires that the
plan incorporate new data or projections including, but not limited
to, the quantity of emission reductions actually achieved in the
preceding three-year period and the rates of population-related,
industry-related, and vehicle-related emissions growth actually
experienced in the district and projected for the future. The
1997 AQMP serves as the comprehensive plan update for the South
Coast Air Basin.

</PRE>
<HR>

<H3>The Act suggests a number of air quality indicators, including
actual emission reductions, ozone and carbon monoxide design value
improvements, population exposure reductions, and pollutant concentration
hours. In Chapter 6, plan effectiveness is illustrated by trends
in the following indicators:</H3>

<UL>
<LI>volatile organic compound, oxides of nitrogen, and carbon
monoxide emissions,
<LI>nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, and ozone air quality (i.e.,
exceedance days), and
<LI>nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, and ozone populational
exposure above air quality standards.
</UL>
<P>
<b>Emission Reductions</b>

<P>
According to the CCAA, districts must design their air quality
management plan to achieve a reduction in basinwide emissions
of five percent or more per year (or 15 percent or more in a three-year
period) for each nonattainment pollutant or its precursors (H&amp;SC
40914). However, an air basin may use an alternative emission
reduction strategy which achieves a reduction of less than 5 percent
per year if it can be demonstrated that either of the following
applies:
<UL>
<LI>The alternative emission reduction strategy is equal to or
more effective than the 5 percent per year control approach in
improving air quality; or
<LI>That despite the inclusion of every feasible measure, and
an expeditious adoption schedule, the air basin is unable to achieve
the 5 percent per year reduction in emissions.
</UL>

<P>
For emission reduction accounting purposes, the ARB has established
a seven-year initial reporting period from January 1, 1988, to
December 31, 1994 (Section 70701 of the California Code of Regulations).
The reporting intervals after this initial period occur every
three years (i.e., 1997, 2000, etc.). Therefore, the 1997 AQMP
must seek to achieve a 35 percent emissions reduction for the
initial reporting period and a 15 percent additional reduction
for every subsequent interval.<P>
<b>Population Exposure</b>

<P>
The CCAA also requires that the 1997 AQMP control measures reduce
overall population exposure to criteria pollutants. Specifically,
exposure to severe nonattainment pollutants above standards must
be reduced from 1986 through 1988 levels by at least 25 percent
by December 31, 1994; 40 percent by December 31, 1997; and 50
percent by December 31, 2000. Reductions are to be calculated
based on per-capita exposure and the severity of exceedances.
This provision is applicable to ozone, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen
dioxide in the Basin [H&amp;SC 40920(c)]. The definition of exposure
is the number of persons exposed to a specific pollutant concentration
level above the state standard times the number of hours. The
per-capita exposure is the population exposure (units of pphm-persons-hours)
divided by the total population.
<P><b>Control Measure Ranking</b>

<P>
The CCAA requires the District Governing Board to determine that
the AQMP is a cost-effective strategy that will achieve attainment
of the state standards by the earliest practicable date (H&amp;SC
40913). In addition, the Plan must include an assessment of the
cost-effectiveness of available and proposed measures and a list
of the measures ranked from the least cost-effective to the most
cost-effective [H&amp;SC 40922(a)].
<P>
In addition to the relative cost-effectiveness of the measures,
the District must consider other factors as well in developing
an adoption and implementation schedule [H&amp;SC 40922(b)]. The
other factors noted in the CCAA include technological feasibility,
emission reduction potential, rate of reduction, public acceptability,
and enforceability. Efficiency, equity, and legal authority have
also been included in the 1997 AQMP for prioritization purposes
because of their importance. The results of the prioritization
are given in Chapter 6.
<P><b>Pollutant Transport</b>

<P>
The South Coast Air Basin both transports to and receives air
pollutants from the coastal portions of Ventura and Santa Barbara
counties in the South Central Coast Air Basin. The South Coast
Air Basin also receives air pollutants from oil and gas development
operations on the outer continental shelf. The 1997 AQMP does
not specifically address the control requirements for these adjacent
areas. However, the control measures in this Plan meet both the
CAA and CCAA transport requirements and will assist downwind areas
in complying with the federal ozone air quality standard.
<P>
The Antelope Valley and the Coachella Valley are both classified
as &quot;severe-17&quot; ozone nonattainment areas under the CAA.
The San Bernardino county portion of the Mojave Desert is under
the jurisdiction of the Mojave Desert Air Quality Management District
(MDAQMD) and is also classified as &quot;severe-17.&quot; These
areas must comply with the federal ozone air quality standard
by 2007. The CAA requires separate attainment and post-1996 rate-of-progress
demonstrations for each severe air basin under the District's
jurisdiction. These were provided separately for the Antelope
Valley and the Coachella-San Jacinto Planning Area in the 1994
AQMP Appendices I-A and I-B, respectively. Revisions to the attainment
demonstration for these areas are provided in Chapter 8 and Appendix
V.
<P>
Areas upwind of the South Coast Air Basin (primarily Ventura county,
but also including Santa Barbara county and the outer continental
shelf) will need to reduce emissions to allow those areas to come
into compliance with all air quality standards. If the South Coast
Air Basin is to comply, sources in these upwind areas may need
to reduce emissions further (i.e., reduce emissions beyond what
may be required to achieve the standards in these areas).
