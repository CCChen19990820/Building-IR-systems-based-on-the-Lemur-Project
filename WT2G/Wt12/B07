<P>The Coachella Valley (CV) is a serious non-attainment area for PM10, but outstanding local efforts to reduce PM10 emissions have been very successful. As a result, the Valley can now qualify for redesignation to attainment, becoming the first serious area in the country to qualify for this action. The CV Plan contains a PM10 attainment redesignation request and required supporting documentation, including a Maintenance Plan and Natural Events Action Plan.

<P>On April 12, 1996, the Board approved development of a pilot system for electronically filing permit applications via the Internet. The pilot system for the Web-Actuated Request for Permits (WARP) was moved into production for on-line receipt of permit applications in November 1996. WARP allows participating facilities to file permit applications using a secure link on the Internet. In addition, through WARP, applicants are able to access status information regarding the progress of their electronic application through the AQMD&#146;s evaluation process. A short demonstration of WARP will be made to exhibit this permit streamlining effort.

<P><B>29.  Adopt the Coachella Valley PM10 Attainment Redesignation Request and Maintenance Plan and Certify the Final Environmental Impact Report</B>

<A HREF="mailto:mzeldin@aqmd.gov"><IMG Align = Top SRC = "/icon/mails.gif"

<P>The Board conducted a public hearing December 6, 1996 in Palm Desert, California to consider adopting the Coachella Valley PM10 Attainment Redesignation Request and Maintenance Plan and certifying the Final Environmental Impact Report. The public hearing was continued to 
  December 13, 1996.




<P><B>30.  <a href = "961230a.html">Amend Rule 1130.1 - Screen Printing Operations</a>
</B>
<br>Broadbent (909) 396-3789
<BR>
<A HREF="mailto:jbroadbent@aqmd.gov"><IMG Align = Top SRC = "/icon/mails.gif"
    ALT = "Mail"></A>(jbroadbent@aqmd.gov )



<P>Proposed amendments will address concerns raised by the industry, ink manufacturers, and staff by creating higher VOC limits for various screen printing operations and postponing the implementation of the lower VOC limit for extreme performance applications. The amendments will result in a permanent emission reduction loss of 0.13 ton per day and delay the 0.28 ton per day emission reduction associated with extreme performance applications from 1998 to 2003. This was reviewed by the Stationary Source Committee on December 5, 1996.



<P><B>31.  Amend Rule 1124 - Aerospace Assembly and Component Manufacturing Operations
</B>
<br>Coy (909) 396-2434
<BR>
<a href="mailto:ccoy@aqmd.gov"><IMG src="/icon/mails.gif" alt="Mail" border=2
    align=top></a>(ccoy@aqmd.gov )

<P>Proposed amendments will redefine adhesion promoter as an adhesive bonding primer and extend the compliance dates for: several types of adhesive bonding primers, fuel-tank coatings, solid-film lubricants and primer coatings from 1997 to either 1998, 1999, 2000, or 2002, because compliant coatings have not been qualified by all major aerospace companies. In addition, the VOC limits are proposed to be decreased for dry lubricative coatings. This was reviewed by the Stationary Source Committee on December 5, 1996.

<P><B>32.  <a href = "961232a.html">Amend Rule 219 - Equipment Not Requiring a Written Permit Pursuant to Regulation II</a>
</B>
<br>Broadbent (909) 396-3789
<BR>
<A HREF="mailto:jbroadbent@aqmd.gov"><IMG Align = Top SRC = "/icon/mails.gif"
    ALT = "Mail"></A>(jbroadbent@aqmd.gov )


<P>Rule 219 identifies equipment and processes which are exempt from AQMD written permits. The proposed amendments focus on implementing the first tier of the 1996 AQMD Regulatory Reform Initiative to &quot;eliminate permits for small businesses&quot; by removing approximately 10,000 permits from the system and reducing the number of expected new applications by 1,000/year. The proposal would also require permits for all equipment subject to state Air Toxic Control Measures and federal NESHAP. This was reviewed by the Stationary Source Committee September 20, 1996. Fiscal impact was reviewed by the Administrative Committee October 18, 1996.

<h2>Agendas &amp; Workshops</h2>

<p><img src="/icon/line4.gif" border=0 ></p></center>
The AQMD wants your help in formulating policies and rules. Here's where to get all current and
past agendas for the Governing Board, Board Committees, Hearing Board and
workshop notices. 

<ul>
<li><a href="/hb/gb_cal95.html">Governing Board Calendar, Agendas, &amp;
Minutes</a> &nbsp;In most cases, clicking on &quot;agenda&quot; will provide
you with a complete agenda package, including Board letters and staff reports.

</li>

<li><a href="/hearbd/hb_cal.html">Hearing Board Calendar</a> </li>

<li><a href="/pub_edu/pubedu1.html">Workshop Notices</a> (updated weekly)
&nbsp; It is AQMD policy to make proposed rule language available at the
time notices are issued or such other time specified in the notice</li>

<CENTER><H2>Rules and Regulations</H2></CENTER>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="/icon/line4.gif"></CENTER> 
<P>Rules and regulations help businesses reduce harmful emissions 
for the public's benefit. This includes the new Regional Clean 
Air Incentives Market <A HREF="/reclaim/reclaim.html"> 
<IMG SRC="/icon/reclaim2.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM" ALT=RECLAIM></A> 
which creates financial rewards for businesses 
that cut emissions more than required.
<P>
District Rules and Regulations contained in this area are currently 
in effect in the four-county area. Because knowledge about air pollution 
is constantly growing, these rules and regulations are in a dynamic 
state, constantly changing. <I><A HREF="#Recently">(See Recently Adopted, Amended, or Repealed Rules)</I></A>
<P>
Each regulation is broken down into a number of rules, each of 
which deals with a specific topic. For instance, Regulation II 
deals with permits, while Rules 201 through 221 pertain to specific 
types of permits, how they are granted and administered, and their 
impact.
<P>
Many of the rules relate to a specific type of operation or source 
of pollution. These generally contain a statement of conditions 
under which the rule applies, definitions of terms, requirements 
of the rule, and allowances or exemptions. Anyone reading such 
a rule for the first time may wish to go through the definitions 
first in order to obtain an idea of what the rule covers. Exemptions 
may be read next; readers may find that the rule does not apply 
to their operation. In some cases, there may be more than one 
way to comply with the rule. Finally, determine the specific requirements 
of the rule.

<H2><FONT FACE="Verdana" ><B>UNDERSTANDING AQMD PERMITS</B></FONT></CENTER></H2>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<HR ALIGN=CENTER>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=3>State and federal clean air regulations mean that air pollution control permits are a part of doing business in the Basin.  Any equipment that may cause or control air pollution requires a permit from AQMD.</FONT>
<BR>
<H2>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="+1"><B>Why do I need a permit?</B></FONT></H2>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=3>A permit is a written authorization to build, install, alter, replace, or operate equipment that emits or controls the emission of air contaminants, like oxides of nitrogen (NO<SUB>x</SUB>), carbon monoxide (CO), fine particulate matter (PM10), oxides of sulfur (SO<SUB>x</SUB>), or toxics. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=3>Permits are also required when a business using such equipment changes ownership or when such equipment is moved from one location to another.  When AQMD ensures that a piece of equipment complies with applicable <A HREF="/rules/rulesreg.html">rules and regulations</A>, it issues a permit to the equipment owner or source.  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=3>Permits ensure that emission controls meet the need for our region to make steady progress toward achieving and maintaining <A HREF="/aqmp/97draft/main/ch2/ch20618.html#E9E2">federal and state air quality standards</A>.   Any piece of equipment that emits or controls air contaminants (such as nitrogen oxides or reactive organic gases) requires a permit prior to installation and operation unless it is specifically exempted from the permit requirement by AQMD <A HREF="/rules/html/r219.html">Rule 219</A> (Equipment Not Requiring a Written Permit).  Although each piece of equipment required to be permitted has received an individual permit in the past, AQMD's <A HREF="/reclaim/reclaim.html">RECLAIM</A> program enables all equipment at some facilities to be covered by a single facility permit.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=3>Permits are required prior to construction, installation, or operation for all equipment unless exempted.  It is good practice to apply for and receive a permit before purchasing new equipment in order to know exactly what the permit conditions and other requirements will be before construction, installation, and operation begin.</FONT>
<BR>
<H2>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="+1"><B>How do I obtain a permit?</B></FONT></H2>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=3>To obtain a permit from AQMD, you will need to complete a general application form for a Permit to Operate or a Permit to Construct (<A HREF="ftp://ftp.aqmd.gov/pub/forms/400-a.doc">Form 400-A</A>).  In addition, you will need to fill out the appropriate (<A HREF="/permit/int-400e.html">400-E-xx</A>) supplemental application form</A> for each piece of equipment that requires a permit.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=3>To avoid delay in processing, please be certain to fill out these application forms completely.  The information you provide will be used to evaluate the environmental impact, if any, of your equipment.  By state law, a health risk analysis may be required if toxic chemicals are involved.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=3>Applications and fee checks can be submitted by mail or in person.  Fee information can be obtained by calling Permit Service Information at (909) 396-2468 or by writing to:</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=3><STRONG>Diamond Bar CA 91765-0944</STRONG></FONT></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=3>Please keep a copy of your application and your check as well as any other correspondence with AQMD.  You can expect staff to contact you by letter or by phone after you have submitted your completed application.</FONT>
<BR>
<H2>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="+1"><B>What happens when I submit my permit application to AQMD?</B></FONT></H2>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=3>The following steps describe AQMD's permitting process:</FONT>
<ul>
<li>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=3>Receipt by AQMD of applicant's Permit to Construct application</FONT></LI>
<li>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=3>Review to ensure that information submitted in application is complete and accurate</FONT></LI>
<li>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=3>Review to determine that proposed equipment will be built and operated consistent with AQMD rules, regulations, and policies</FONT></LI>
<li>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=3>Issuance of Permit to Construct, authorizing applicant to install equipment (may serve as temporary Permit to Operate under some conditions)</FONT></LI>
<li>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=3>Construction/installation of equipment by source</FONT></LI>
<li>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=3>AQMD inspection to verify that equipment has been built and installed as required by the Permit to Construct, and to confirm that the equipment operates in compliance with AQMD rules and regulations</FONT></LI>
<li>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=3>Issuance of Permit to Operate</FONT></LI>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=3>Permit conditions limit or require specific actions by a source to ensure:</FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=3>Compliance with a <A HREF="/rules/rulesreg.html">rule or regulation</A></FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=3>Keeping emissions within federal <A HREF="/rules/html/tofc13.html">New Source Review</A> allowances</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=3>Proper operation of control devices</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=3>Establishment of recordkeeping and reporting mechanisms</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=3>Limiting of toxic emissions</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=3>Control of dust or odors</FONT></LI>
</UL>
<H2>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="+1"><B>How long does it take to receive a permit?</B></FONT></H2>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=3>For more efficient processing, permit applications are classified as minor, moderate, and major.  Under AQMD&#146;s 7/30/180-day permitting program:</FONT>
<blockquote><li>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=3>Minor sources generally receive their permits within seven days of filing.  Typical minor sources are those which have just one or two pieces of equipment that are operated in a standardized fashion and do not emit toxic pollutants.</FONT></UL></BLOCKQUOTE>
</UL>
<blockquote><li>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=3>Moderate sources are usually issued permits within 30 days of filing.  Moderate sources have equipment and processes that are not easily standardized, such as asphalt batching plants and medium-sized boilers used in food processing plants.</FONT></UL></BLOCKQUOTE>
</UL>
<blockquote><li>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=3>Major sources, such as oil refineries, chemical plants, sewage treatment works, and other businesses that emit air toxics or use complicated equipment, typically require a longer period of time for permit processing, partly due to state laws requiring public comment periods and/or health risk assessments.</FONT></UL></BLOCKQUOTE>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=3>AQMD&#146;s Stationary Source Compliance (SSC) engineers process permits for multi-permit facilities on a consolidated basis.  One engineer will be your contact for a given project.</FONT>
<H2>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="+1"><B>Compliance with permit conditions is important</B></FONT></H2>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=3>Each instance of noncompliance with a permit condition can subject a facility to a fine or penalty.  It is very important for sources to thoroughly review the construction and operating permit conditions immediately upon receipt to ensure that they are correct and that the equipment can be operated in compliance.  To change permit conditions, an appeal must be filed within ten (10) days of receiving the permit.  For more information, contact AQMD Customer Service at (909) 396-2900.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="+1"><A NAME="pepp"><B>Four steps to expedited processing:<BR>
AQMD&#146;s new Permit Enhancement Program</A></B></font>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=3>AQMD recently identified common causes of delay in permit processing:  About 80% of rejected applications have missing or incorrect fees, while the remainder have missing or incomplete forms. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=3>Based on this information, a new four-step Permit Enhancement Program has been designed to reduce filing errors, enhance customer service, and expedite processing:  </FONT>
<BR>
<BR><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="+1"><B>Step I:<BR>
Reduce filing errors.</B></FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=3>Simplify instructions.</FONT></LI>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=3>A new <A HREF="/permit/pap_acc3.html">application checklist</A>, fee calculation worksheet, and <A HREF="/permit/c2e_tabl.html">permit application reference table</A> linking forms to rules, fees, and equipment category numbers have been developed to help applicants provide complete information and expedite processing.</FONT></LI>
<P>
<LI><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=3>Reduce the number of forms.</FONT></LI>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=3>Equipment-specific application forms have been consolidated (see <A HREF="/permit/c2e_tabl.html#table II"> Table II</A>).  Requests for the same general information on each revised form (e.g., facility name, address, location, contact personnel, etc.) have been deleted.</FONT></LI>
<P>
<li><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=3>Give prompt feedback.</FONT></LI>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=3>Revised criteria for complete applications enable applicants to submit all information necessary for prompt processing.  Based on these criteria, applicants receive letters notifying them of the acceptance or rejection of permit applications.  Acceptance letters furnish the estimated date of permit issuance.  Rejection letters identify information that is either missing or incorrect, and help applicants submit complete applications.</FONT></LI></UL>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="+1"><B>Step II:<BR>
Provide over-the-counter service.</B></FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=3>In addition to avoiding backlogs and maintaining commitments to 7/30/180-day processing, the main lobby of AQMD&#146;s Diamond Bar office has been redesigned to provide:</FONT>
<UL>
<P>
<LI><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=3>Technical assistance.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=3>AQMD engineering staff provide full-time over-the-counter technical assistance to walk-in applicants by appointment or on a first come, first served basis.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=3>Convenient over-the-counter filing for 7/30/180-day applications and &quot;while you wait&quot; issuance of <A HREF="/permit/cert_reg.html">certification/registration permits</A>.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=3>In addition to over-the-counter filing of 7/30/180-day permit applications, new &quot;while you wait&quot; over-the-counter permits for qualifying certified, registered, and other specific types of equipment will be being issued by AQMD staff.</FONT></UL>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="+1"><B>Step III:<BR>
Let everyone know.</B></FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=3>Increased information access.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=3>Now applicants can download general (<A HREF="ftp://ftp.aqmd.gov/pub/forms/400-a.doc">400-A</A>) and equipment-specific (<A HREF="/permit/int-400e.html">400-E-xx</A>) supplemental application forms by accessing <A HREF="http://www.aqmd.gov/">AQMD&#146;s Internet Home Page </A>.  In addition, applicants can (<A HREF="/warp_main/instructions.html">view or download</A>) and electronically file application forms for boilers, internal combustion engines, fuel storage and dispensing, and negative air machines. Future goals include expanded electronic application filing and permit issuance.</FONT></LI>
<P>
<LI><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=3>Spread the good news.</FONT><P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=3>Brochures, compliance kits, and other media have been developed to increase public awareness of new program enhancements and ensure that applicants are fully informed of AQMD application submittal requirements. </FONT></LI></UL>
<P><P><BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="+1"><B>Step IV:<BR>
Determine effectiveness.</B></FONT>
<ul>
<li><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=3>Track measurable outputs.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=3>A new tracking program will enable staff to determine the processing status of 7/30/180-day application submittals. Appropriate benchmarks for measuring overall program effectiveness are being determined, and monthly reviews will document program milestones and highlight opportunities for further enhancement.</FONT>
<P></LI>
<LI><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=3>Ask for feedback. </FONT>
<P>

<B>General Application Form 400-A</B></H3>
<P>
All facilities applying for a Permit to Construct or Permit to Operate must complete application Form 400-A.  The 400-A form serves as the &quot;cover letter&quot; for all types of permit applications. <A HREF="ftp://ftp.aqmd.gov/pub/forms/400-a.doc">Form 400-A</A> requests complete facility information, as well as the type of application to be filed (e.g., new construction, modification of existing permit, change of permit conditions, change of permittee).  Applicants may also be required to complete additional supplemental forms pertaining to specific types of equipment.
<UL>
<P><B>Special Note:  Title V Facilities</B>
<P><A HREF="/titlev/index.html ">Title V</A> facilities should continue to use Form 400-A to apply for a Permit to Construct or Permit to Operate for new construction, alteration, relocation, change of permit condition, change of owner, or reinstatement of an expired permit, prior to final Title V permit issuance.
</UL>
<H3>
<B><A NAME="400-E-XX">Equipment-Specific Application Forms 400-E-xx</A></B></H3>
<P>
In addition to <A HREF="ftp://ftp.aqmd.gov/pub/forms/400-a.doc">Form 400-A</A>, facilities should submit applicable supplemental Equipment-Specific Application Forms 400-E-xx (previously, Forms 400-C-xx) with the appropriate fee when applying for a Permit to Construct or Permit to Operate.
<P>
The new revised equipment-specific Forms 400-E-xx request specific data relating to the facility and its equipment, process, operating conditions, and emissions, and are simpler and more streamlined than the previous Forms 400-C-xx.  <A HREF="c2e_tabl.html#table I">Table I</A> lists these revised equipment-specific 400-E-xx forms, and  <A HREF="c2e_tabl.html#table II">Table II</A> identifies their relationship to the former 400-C-xx forms. <STRONG>(Please destroy any existing Forms 400-C-xx </STRONG>at your facility since these forms will no longer be accepted when submitting an application for Permit to Construct or Permit to Operate.)<p> Please note that these forms are prepared for general equipment types.  Other information, such as air quality modeling and risk assessment, may be required in special cases. <BR>
<BR> <A HREF="ftp://ftp.aqmd.gov/pub/forms/400-e-gi.doc">Form 400-E-GI</A> must be submitted if no other Form 400-E-xx applies to your specific equipment or process.

<HR ALIGN=CENTER>
<p>
AQMD <A HREF="/rules/html/tofc3.html">Regulation III</A> details specific fees and how they are applied.  This regulation can be ordered by calling AQMD&#146;s Public Information Center at (909) 396-3600 and is also available for downloading from the AQMD home page (http://www.aqmd.gov).
<BR>
<H3>
<B>Permit processing fee</B></H3>
<P>
When you apply for a <A HREF="/permit/perm_net.html">permit</A>, you must pay a permit processing fee.  The fee must accompany the application in order for the application to be processed.  Permit processing fees are established by <A HREF="/hb/govbd.html">AQMD&#146;s Governing Board</A>, based on the size and complexity of the equipment to be permitted and, in some instances, the type of air pollution being emitted.
<BR>
<H3>
<B>Fee reductions for multiple permits</B></H3>
<P>
If a business seeks permits for more than one of the same (identical) or functionally similar unit, the full fee is only required for the first unit.  Each additional unit is charged 25% of the full fee.
<BR>
<H3>
<B>Reduced fees for small businesses</B></H3>
<P>
Small businesses are entitled to lower fee rates.  A small business is defined by AQMD <A HREF="/rules/html/r102.html">Rule 102</A> as one with ten or fewer employees and gross annual receipts of $500,000 or less.
<BR>
<H3>
<B>Permit fees for certified/registered equipment</B></H3>
<P>
Certain types of equipment are already certified by their manufacturer.  Under this system, businesses can obtain permits for <A HREF="/permit/cert_reg.html">certified/registered equipment</A> quickly, either by mail or over the counter.  Fees for such permits are lower than those for permits requiring individual review.
<BR>
<H3>
<B>Annual operating permit renewal fee</B></H3>
<P>
You will be billed each year for the operating fee listed in Regulation III.  Your annual operating fee must be paid by the due date on the billing statement to avoid cancellation of your permit which could result in a reinstatement fee.
<BR>
<H3>
<B>Annual operating permit emission fees</B></H3>
<P>
Industrial sources must pay fees for releasing certain air pollutants in excess of four tons per year.  The one exception is carbon monoxide (CO).  The fees for CO are based on emissions of 100 tons or more.
<P>
Fees for emissions are affixed on a per ton basis.  The pollutants include reactive organic compounds (ROC), specific organic, particulate matter (PM or PM<SUB>10</SUB>), nitrogen oxides (NO<SUB>x</SUB>) and sulfur oxides (SO<SUB>x</SUB>).
<BR>
<H3>
<B>AQMD fee review committee</B></H3>
<P>
If you have reason to believe that your fees were assessed incorrectly or in a way that is inconsistent with Regulation III, please contact the Public Advisor at (909) 396-2744 and request a petition to have your fees reviewed by AQMD&#146;s <A HREF="/business/baser.html#fc">Fee Review Committee</A>.

<P><A NAME="WHAT IS"></A><B>What is Title V?</B></P>

<P>Title V is the name of a new program to standardize permits and the
permitting process for major sources of emissions across the country. It
will require more than 1000 of the largest facilities in the AQMD to obtain
new, more comprehensive permits over the next three years. Each permit
will be subject to US EPA&nbsp;review.</P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.epa.gov/oar/oaq_caa.html">Title V of the 1990 federal
Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA)</A> required the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) to establish a national, federally enforceable operating permit
program. Accordingly, EPA published <A HREF="http://law.house.gov/cfr.htm">Title
40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 1, Part 70 (Part 70)</A>,
which requires each state or local permitting authority to develop and
submit a federally enforceable facility operating permit program for EPA
approval. </P>

<P>Title V is intended to further facilitate and enhance air quality planning,
emission controls, and compliance, and to improve existing emission inventories.
</P>

<P>In addition to existing AQMD regulations, Title V provides for: </P>

<UL>
<P> EPA veto authority over permit issuance,<BR>
 Greater opportunity for federal and citizen enforcement,<BR>
 Enhanced public participation during the permit issuance process,<BR>
 Clearer determination of applicable requirements; and <BR>
 Improved enforceability of applicable requirements. <BR>
</P>
</UL>

<P>AQMD adopted <A HREF="/rules/html/tofc30.html">Regulation
XXX</A> rules on October 8, 1993, to meet the requirements of Part 70 and
to interface the Title V permitting effort with AQMDs existing comprehensive
permit program. <A HREF="/rules/html/tofc30.html">Regulation
XXX</A> rules were amended August 11, 1995, to clarify requirements necessary
to gain EPA interim program approval.<A HREF="/rules/html/reg5.html#r518">
Rule 518</A> and <A HREF="/rules/html/reg5.html#r5181">Rule
518.1</A> were also amended August 11, 1995, to address Hearing Board procedures
for Title V facilities and permit appeal procedures for Title V facilities,
respectively. <A HREF="/rules/html/reg5.html#r5182">Rule
518.2</A> was adopted January 12, 1996, to provide a procedure for federal
recognition of variances through alternative operating conditions. </P>

<P>AQMD expects interim approval of its Title V program on October 28,
1996. Under federal law, all Title V facilities must apply for permits
within one year of the October 28, 1996, effective date, and AQMD must
issue all permits within three years of the effective date at the rate
of at least one-third of the permits per year. Therefore, AQMD has divided
the Title V universe into Groups A, B, and C. In order to issue one-third
of the permits (i.e., Group A) in the first program year, AQMD will require
all Group A facilities to submit initial Title V permit applications within
three months of the effective date. </P>

<LI><B>A new way of doing things</B><BR>
<BR>
RECLAIM is a revolutionary new approach to air quality regulation.  This program has the potential to clean up our air more effectively than traditional regulations by harnessing the power of the marketplace.  For businesses, RECLAIM means greater flexibility and a financial incentive to reduce air pollution beyond what clean air laws and traditional command-and-control rules require. For the public, RECLAIM means guaranteed annual reductions in air pollution until public health standards are achieved.
<P>
<LI><B>Clean air</B><BR>
<BR>
This region, the smoggiest in the nation, is required to achieve federal clean air health standards by 2010. Because RECLAIM offers financial incentives to reduce emissions, it is expected to reach that goal at a lower cost with increased flexibility. It requires industries and businesses to cut their emissions by a specific amount each year, resulting in an almost 80% reduction by 2003 for nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur oxides (SOx).
</UL>
<P>
<B>Emissions Market</B> <P>
<IMG SRC="/icon/recfig1.gif" ALT="EMISSION MARKET" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> <P>
Businesses that beat their reduction targets can trade their credits on the open market. Using market forces allows pollution to be cut in the most economical way. The more reductions, the greater the asset.
<P>
<B>Today</B> <P>
<IMG SRC="/icon/rectoday.gif" ALT="TODAY" ALIGN="CENTER"><P>
Under command-and-control, almost every piece of equipment that emits air pollution is regulated individually by AQMD.

Facilities that reduce emissions beyond annual targets have an asset to sell.
<UL>
<LI><B>Improved public health</B><BR>
Air pollution threatens the health of everyone who breathes in Southern California. Smog and other pollutants can cause everything from watery eyes and fatigue to respiratory disease and cancer.  Smog literally eats away paint, rubber, cement--and human lung tissue. By meeting health standards, RECLAIM can reclaim the quality of life we all deserve.
<P>
<LI><B>Flexibility and cost savings for businesses</B><BR>
Traditional regulations, known as command-and-control, set specific limits on each piece of equipment and each process that contributes to air pollution. RECLAIM is different. It sets a factory-wide pollution limit for each business, and lets businesses decide what equipment, processes and materials they will use to meet their emission limits. Under RECLAIM, these allowable emission limits decline a specific amount each year. Companies will be free to choose the most cost-effective, economical ways to reduce pollution.
<P>
Companies that are innovative and can reduce emissions more than required can then sell excess emission reductions to other firms.  Buyers will be companies that need more time to clean up or find the cost of buying credits cheaper than buying and installing new equipment.
<P>
<LI><B>RECLAIM trading credits</B><BR>
Each firm participating in RECLAIM will receive RECLAIM trading credits equal to its annual emissions limit. Credits are assigned based on past peak production and the requirements of existing rules and control measures. Credits are assigned each year and can be bought or sold for use within that year. Facilities must hold credits equal to their actual emissions. They can sell excess credits to firms that cannot or choose not to meet their limits.  Because businesses are different, some can reduce emissions more easily and at less cost than others. The AQMD will maintain a list of all parties holding credits. No matter who buys or sells credits, RECLAIM requires that total emissions from all participating companies be reduced each year.
<P>
<LI><B>Changes for a variety of companies</B><BR>
Participation in RECAIM will start with facilities that emit four or more tons per year of either nitrogen oxides (NOx) or sulfur oxides (SOx) from permitted equipment. These companies represent a significant share of the smog-forming emissions from business and industry in the South Coast Air Basin.
<P>
<LI><B>Taking advantage of new technologies</B><BR>
RECLAIM encourages use of the latest and cleanest technology and the development of even more advanced processes. To monitor emissions at larger companies, RECLAIM will use computer networks that link remote sensors directly to monitors at AQMD headquarters.<BR>
<BR>
Not only does this give AQMD a more accurate tally of emissions, it simplifies record-keeping for businesses.
<P>
<LI><B>Responding to community</B><BR>
AQMD developed RECLAIM to help the South Coast Air Basin achieve clean air more efficiently and economically. RECLAIM is the result of three years of planning by AQMD staff and committees representing industry, small business, labor, environmentalists, economists, community groups, the state Air Resources Board and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
<BR>
</UL>
<P>
<B>When will RECLAIM begin?</B> <P>
The RECLAIM program covering nitrogen oxide and sulfur oxide emissions started January 1, 1994. Some facilities participate based on the calendar year (January 1 through December 31); others based on the fiscal year (July 1 through June 30).
<P>
If you'd like to get copies of the RECLAIM rules or more detailed reports on the program, contact the South Coast Air Quality Management Public Information Center at (800) 242-4666.
<P>
AQMD is the regional government agency responsible for air pollution control in the nation's smoggiest area--Los Angeles, Orange and Riverside counties, and non-desert San Bernardino County.

Several organizations train individuals to prepare applications for AQMD permits. 
AQMD certifies those who successfully pass a written exam as Certified Permitting Professionals (CPP).  
As part of the services provided to CPPs, the AQMD has set up a Data Access System to enable CPPs to connect to 
AQMD's computer system and directly obtain data and information about the facilities for which they are preparing applications.
<P>
To use this system, you must have a <B>valid</B> password <B>and</B> be a <B>current</B> Certified Permitting Professional.  
You will only be able to access data for companies that have given the AQMD written authorization.
<P>
If you wish to get more information about the CPP Program, please call the CPP line at (909) 396-3383.

<p><b>INTRODUCTION</b> </p>

<p>The Registration and Intercredit Trading Team of the South Coast Air
Quality Management District (AQMD) has been entrusted to ensure the smooth
functioning of the CPP Program. This team, headed by Jill Whynot, Senior
Manager, recently updated the CPP reference manual, and is also responsible
for administering the CPP exams. The revised CPP manual is being mailed
out, free of charge, to current CPPs with their renewed certification.
Copies can also be purchased through our subscription services for $24.42.
</p>

<p>If you have any questions on this program or the CPP Data Access System
please call Hugh Heney at (909) 396-2372 or Shams Hasan at (909) 396-2338.
</p>

<p>Alfonso Baez, who has contributed significantly to the programs success,
has been reassigned to AQMDs Small Business Assistance Office. We wish
him the best in his new endeavors. </p>

<br><b>DATA ACCESS SYSTEM UPDATE</b> </p>

<p>As part of its commitment to provide full support to Certified Permitting
Professionals (CPPs), AQMD has set up a Data Access System to enable CPPs
to connect to AQMD's computer system and directly obtain data about the
facilities for which they are preparing applications. A new, more user-friendly
and efficient data retrieval system for CPPs has been developed. </p>

<p>The new data retrieval system provides some significant changes. Data
access is real-time, and is through a windows-based Internet system, instead
of a DOS-based program that had some delay for data updates. In addition,
CPPs will now be able to access data for an unlimited number of companies,
provided they have appropriate authorizations. </p>

<p>In order to use the Data Access System, you must have a valid password
and be a current Certified Permitting Professional. Existing passwords
for the current system will work for the new system automatically. Access
to data will be limited to companies that have given their authorization.
The authorization must be on company letterhead, signed by a responsible
company official. The letter should include (1) your full name, (2) CPP
identification number, (3) company name and address, (4) company ID number,
and (5) confirmation that they have granted you access to their AQMD records.

<br><b>CPP CERTIFICATION EXAMS</b> </p>

<p>Certification examinations for CPPs were held on July 10, 1996, at AQMD
Headquarters, Diamond Bar. The next examination is scheduled for January
8, 1997. The exam fee is $150. If you have any questions, or wish to register
for the next exam, please call the CPP Hotline number given at the end
of this newsletter. </p>

<h2>Registration Help</h2>
<dl>
 <li><b>Username</b> - A username is a way of identifying yourself to the
      WARP system. Commonly, usernames are created by prepending your
      last name with your first initial. For example, if your name is 
      Steve Johnson, a good choice of a username might be: 
      <i>sjohnson</i>. You can choose any username, but it is a good idea
      to make it easy to remember.<p>
 <li><b>Password</b> - A password is a good method of security. By using
      your password, you are confirming that you actually are the person 
      you claim to be. Good passwords are combinations of letters, numbers
      and punctuation. For example, the password <i>Il2es!</i> means 
      nothing to anyone else, but to you, it could mean, "<b>I</b> 
      <b>l</b>ove <b>to</b> <b>e</b>at <b>s</b>trawberrys <b>!</b>"
      Bad passwords are words which can be found in a dictionary.<p>
 <li><b>Facility ID</b> - You must supply your AQMD Facility ID. 
      Facilities without an AQMD Facility ID are not eligible to use the 
      WARP system.<p>
 <li><b>IRS ID or SSN</b> - You must supply the Federal Tax ID for your
      facility. If your facility is registered with the AQMD under a 
      personal name, please supply that person's Social Security Number.
      This is another method of security which ensures that individuals 
      not affiliated with your facility have no access to your 
      applications.<p>

<P>
 In Southern California, that old line connotes more than hocus-pocus
acts of disappearance and reappearance by a Hollywood vaudeville
magician.  For us, a different kind of alchemy is at work, affecting
the very air our region's 14 million residents breathe.
<P>
 A complex atmospheric chemistry has made Southern California
residents accustomed to objects that &quot;disappear&quot; and
&quot;reappear&quot; on a daily basis.  Residents know these atmospheric
reactions work on a grand scale, causing major landmarks, even
entire mountain ranges, to vanish.
<P>
 Behind the vanishing act is the region's air pollution, formed
by gases, vapors and particles emitted mostly by the contraptions
and potions of the industrial age.
<P>
 Our densely populated basin, ringed by mountains and often capped
by an inversion layer of hot, dry desert air atop cooler, moister
marine air, is a natural atmospheric repository for any substance
blown by the wind or puffed up from fires, industries and other
sources.
<P>
 This results in a hazy marine layer--a soupy mix which consists
both of invisible gases and small particles that hang suspended
in the air.
<P>
 Some of these particles are emitted directly into the air, such
as diesel soot, soil dust, smoke from fireplaces and cooking,
and asbestos material and rubber particles from brakes and tires
on the region's 10 million motor vehicles.  Other particles form
in the air from gases emitted by burning fossil fuel.
<P>
 Together, they form the cloud of particulate matter that causes
the mountains and other landmarks to regularly disappear into
a haze of gray.  Then when the inversion layer dissipates, the
particulate matter is carried away, revealing glorious vistas
as our mountains and skyline &quot;reappear.&quot;
<P>
 It is often this particulate pollution that people see when they
experience smog in Southern California.  And it is more than an
aesthetic problem.
<P>
 A mounting body of scientific evidence points to particulates
as the most unhealthful component of the region's air pollution
problem.  Moreover, long-term monitoring shows that while levels
of ozone, carbon monoxide and other pollutants are falling, progress
on cutting particulate pollution has been less clear cut.
<P>
 Pressure to reduce particulates is growing, however.  The federal
Clean Air Act sets 1996 as the year the region must come to grips
with this form of pollution and develop a firm plan to finally
clean it up by 2006.  That plan, being developed now, will be
based upon one of the most intensive scientific studies of the
problem ever conducted.  The study results are due early this
summer.
<P>
 Here's a rundown on the health effects of the source of, and
possible solutions to the serious problem of particulate pollution.
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="pm10.gif"><BR>
</CENTER>

<P>
<B><H3>The Nature of Particulate Pollution</H3></B>

<P>
 Particulates in the air are not of uniform size or chemical composition,
which are determined by the sources of pollution within an airshed.
<P>
 In the South Coast Air Basin, which encompasses the urbanized
portions of Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino
counties, particle pollution comes in a wide variety of compounds
and sizes.  Sea salt, blowing soil, road dust, soot and smoke,
pollen, nitrate and sulfate from industries are just a few of
the substances.
<P>
 Much of the particulate is big enough to not be a health concern.
 The nasal passages and upper respiratory tract provide the first
line of defense to protect the lungs from airborne particles.
 The body's  natural filtering and self-cleansing mechanisms catch
larger particles before they can invade deep into the lungs.
<P>
 But particles that are 10 microns or less in diameter -- known
by environmental scientists as &quot;PM10&quot; -- are of greatest
concern.  These microscopic-sized particles are so small they
are not filtered out by the human respiratory system's natural
defenses.  They can penetrate deep into the lungs where they can
become trapped and cause serious health problems.
<P>
 Studies associating these small particles with ill health led
the federal Environmental Protection Agency in 1987 to set new
standards.  These new health standards for PM10 superseded EPA's
former standard, which targeted total suspended particulate, including
the larger particles.
<P>
 EPA's standards established two health limits.  First, that the
annual average level of PM10 should not exceed 50 micrograms per
cubic meter of air.  Second, that PM10 should not exceed a concentration
of 150 micrograms per cubic meter of air averaged over any 24-hour
period.
<P>
 Readings taken in the South Coast Air Basin since 1985 show that
the area regularly exceeds both of these standards.  In 1995,
for instance, numerous air monitoring stations recorded an exceedance
of both the annual average and the 24-hour average standards.
 These exceedances occurred primarily in the inland area which
is downwind of the vast majority of emissions sources.
<P>
 In Riverside County, three air monitoring stations (one in Norco/Corona
and two in metropolitan Riverside) recorded exceedances of the
federal annual average standard with averages of 54.2 and 69 micrograms
per cubic meter of air.  Metropolitan Riverside also had one day
exceeding the federal 24-hour standard, with a peak reading of
219 micrograms per cubic meter of air.
<P>
 In San Bernardino County, stations in the southwest and central
San Bernardino Valley exceeded the federal annual standard with
readings of 54 and 61 micrograms per cubic meter.
<P>
 Virtually all urban monitoring stations have recorded exceedances
of California's tighter annual average standard of 30 micrograms
per cubic meter of air and 24-hour standard of 50 micrograms per
cubic meter of air.
<P>
 As PM10 levels exceed the state 24-hour standard and approach
the federal 24-hour standard, visibility diminishes rapidly. 
That's because the particles, though individually invisible to
the eye, create a haze by reflecting and scattering sunlight.
<P>

<B><H3>Health Effects of PM10</H3></B>

<P>
 All pollution, including particulates, have long been known to
cause respiratory ailments.  In 1930, 63 people in Belgium's Meuse
Valley died after a five-day siege of air pollution that gathered
like a fog.  In 1948, some 7,000 people in Donora, Penn., became
acutely ill during a period of extreme air stagnation.  In London,
5,000 died in three separate episodes in 1948, 1952 and 1956.
 A thick fog polluted with soot and sulfur compounds from burning
coal was deemed the culprit.
<P>
 Today, medical researchers have identified PM10 as one of the
most unhealthful components of air pollution.
<P>
 In a landmark health study that took 16 years to complete, researchers
from Harvard University found a strong association between particle
pollution and early deaths from lung cancer and heart disease
among 8,111 people studied in six cities.  Moreover, the cities
-- Watertown, Mass., Kingston-Harriman, Tenn., St. Louis, Steubenville,
Ohio, Portage, Wis., and Topeka, Kan. -- all have PM10 levels
that <I>meet</I> the federal standards today.  Nevertheless, the
researchers concluded that levels of PM10 in these cities were
diminishing life spans by up to two years.
<P>
 PM10 also increases the risk of bronchitis and makes it harder
for people to fight off pneumonia.  Increased absences from work
and school and increased hospital admissions, particularly among
asthmatics and other sufferers of chronic respiratory disease,
follow.
<P>
 A recent study just released by the Natural Resources Defense
Council estimates there are more than 64,000 premature deaths
a year in the United States due to PM10 exposure.  Here in the
South Coast Air Basin, nearly 14% of those deaths -- over 8,800
-- occur!  This is more than five times as many deaths as previously
estimated in a 1989 study done at California State University
at Fullerton.
<P>

<B><H3>Sources of PM10</H3></B>

<P>
 The primary natural sources of PM10 in the South Coast Air Basin
are the ocean, wind erosion of soil, and wildfires.
<P>
 Salt particles come from the ocean as the spray of waves evaporates,
leaving salt particles suspended in the air.  Winds in the deserts
surrounding the South Coast Air Basin blow soil dust into the
air.
<P>
 Health standards are close to being met in these areas, including
Coachella Valley, through measures that reduce disturbance of
dust caused by human activities, such as construction, farming
and driving on dirt roads.
<P>

<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="sand.gif"><BR>
<I>Blowing dust covers car in the desert just outside the South
Coast Air Basin.</I>
</CENTER>
<P>
 In the Basin, manmade contributors to directly emitted PM10 include:
 fireplace fires, disintegrating tires and brakes, smoke from
barbecues and charbroilers used in restaurants, rock crushing
and quarry operations, vehicles traveling over dirt roads, open
burning, and many others.
<P>
 Gases -- including nitrogen and sulfur oxides and volatile organic
compounds -- are emitted by burning fossil fuel in motor vehicles,
ships, trains, airplanes, construction equipment, industrial boilers,
heaters and even home water heaters.  Volatile organic compounds
also are emitted from paints, coatings, solvents and aerosol spray
cans.  Ammonia, another gas which contributes to PM10, is emitted
by livestock waste, sewage treatment plants and other sources.
<P>
 Typically, metropolitan Riverside is the worst area for fine
particle pollution in the air basin.  Preliminary data from AQMD's
1995 study of the area's PM10 problem show that annually in Riverside
45% of PM10 is directly emitted and 55% is formed in the air from
gases.  Soil dust was the largest component of directly emitted
particulate matter.
<P>
 The analysis also shows that fine particle pollution generally
is worst in the fall, after the intense sunshine of summer passes
and before the cleansing turbulence of winter storms begins. 
Changing light in the fall alters the photochemical reactions
that take place in the air.  This effect, coupled with more stagnant
wind flows, leads to more particulate in the fall.
<P>
 The study also found that the particles in the air formed from
gases generally are much finer than many other components of PM10,
with a large portion being 2.5 microns or less in diameter.  These
particles are now thought to be a greater threat to human health
than particles between 2.5 and 10 microns in diameter.  Accordingly,
the federal EPA is considering setting a new health standard that
targets allowable levels of PM2.5.
<P>

<B><H3>Control Measures</H3></B>

<P>
 AQMD is reviewing the newest study data to determine the adequacy
of the control measures outlined in its 1994 clean air plan in
meeting federal particulate standards.  As part of its upcoming
1997 plan, AQMD will again emphasize the most cost-effective and
technically feasible approaches to reducing PM10 levels.
<P>
 The federal Clean Air Act requires AQMD to implement best available
control measures for directly emitted PM10 by December 1996 and
to develop an overall plan for achieving federal health standards
for PM10 by February 1997.  This latter requirement will be satisfied
by the upcoming 1997 plan.
<P>
 Candidate best available control measures include such things
as improved street cleaning, better control of dust at demolition
and construction sites, coating unpaved roads and parking lots
with dust suppressants, and better soil conservation practices
on farm land.
<P>
 The PM10 plan will again address combustion sources, including
measures to reduce soot and emissions of nitrogen oxides from
heavy-duty trucks and buses, ships at the ports, trains, and a
variety of other sources.  Because these transportation sources
are engaged in interstate or intrastate commerce, it largely is
up to the federal EPA and California Air Resources Board to set
any needed standards.
<P>
 These agencies, in cooperation with AQMD, are working on many
of the needed standards now.  New technologies -- being developed
through public-private partnerships in which AQMD is participating
-- ultimately will help insure these standards can be met.  Among
the emerging technologies are natural gas-powered buses and trucks,
cleaner locomotives, and electric vehicles that are now being
introduced into delivery fleets and ground service at airports.
<P>
 To the extent that EPA refocuses the fine particle pollution
standard from PM10 to PM2.5, efforts to control blowing dust could
become less critical and the need to control combustion sources
could be greater.
<P>
 The need to control ammonia emissions, which feed formation of
fine particle pollution, also will be re-evaluated.  AQMD's 1995
PM10 study indicates that ammonia emissions from Chino dairies
are lower than previously thought.  However, the ammonia does
add to the nitrogen oxide rich air from the heavily populated
west side of the air basin as it blows east toward Riverside and
San Bernardino.  Needed reductions in ammonia may be achieved
as dairies voluntarily relocate for other business reasons to
areas outside the South Coast Air Basin.  If sufficient relocations
occur, direct ammonia controls on dairies may not be necessary.
<P>

<P>

<B><H3>Conclusion</H3></B>

<P>
 Particulate pollution is not just a visibility problem -- it's
a serious health problem.  The intense study of this problem over
the past year demonstrates more clearly than ever the need to
reduce the amount of particulate pollution in this region.  While
PM10 levels are declining somewhat in the South Coast Air Basin
for reasons not fully understood, still more must be done.  The
use of emerging technologies to reduce emissions of the soot and
gases that form PM10 will help.
<P>
 The need to attain health standards for particulate pollution
is becoming clearer and clearer:  it is not only to unveil our
beautiful vistas year-round -- it is to add years to our lives.

<P><B>(a) Purpose</B>
<BRP>The purpose of this Rule is to provide employers with a menu of options to reduce mobile source emissions generated from employee commutes and to comply with federal and state Clean Air Act requirements, including SB 836 (Lewis), Section 182(d)(1)(B) of the federal Clean Air Act or the alternative compliance mechanism established with the District, the state, and federal governments under the Environmental Protection Agency&#146;s Project XL program.
<P><B>(b) Applicability</B>
<P><OL><LI> Effective December 8, 1995, this rule applies to any employer who employs 100 or more employees on a full or part-time basis at a worksite for a consecutive six-month period calculated as a monthly average, except as provided in subdivision (l) of this rule.
<P><LI> Effective January 1, 1997 the applicability threshold specified in paragraph (b)(1) shall be raised to 250.
<P><LI> On or before June 1, 1998, the applicability threshold specified in paragraph (b)(2) shall be adjusted as follows: 
<P>(A) Raised to 500, provided that the Air Resources Board has determined that voluntary ridesharing and other replacement measures have fully achieved the emission reductions that would have been achieved by the employers with less than 250 employees, exempted pursuant to paragraph (b)(2); or
<P>(B) Restored to 100 if the Air Resources Board has not determined that voluntary ridesharing and other replacement measures have achieved the emission reduction levels specified in subparagraph (b)(3)(A).
<P><LI> On or before January 1, 2000, the applicability threshold specified in paragraph (b)(3) shall be adjusted as follows:
<P>(A) Rule 2202 shall be suspended, provided that the Air Resources Board has determined that voluntary ridesharing and other replacement measures have fully achieved the emission reductions that would have been achieved by the employers with less than 500 employees, exempted pursuant to subparagraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3)(A); or
<P>(B) Restored to 250, if the Air Resources Board has not determined that voluntary ridesharing and other replacement measures have achieved the emission reduction levels that would have been achieved by employers with less than 500 employees exempted pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(A); or 
<P>(C) Restored to 100, if the Air Resources Board has not determined that voluntary ridesharing and other replacement measures have achieved the emission reduction levels that would have been achieved by employers with less than 250 employees, exempted pursuant to paragraph (b)(2).
<P><LI> On or before June 1, 2001, the applicability threshold of Rule 2202 shall be adjusted as follows:
<P>(A) Rule 2202 shall be and is hereby repealed and adopted as a backstop rule provided that the Air Resources Board has determined that voluntary ridesharing and other replacement measures fully achieve the emission reductions that would have been achieved by all employers with 100 or more employees exempted pursuant to paragraphs (b)(2) and subparagraphs (b)(3)(A) and (b)(4)(A); or
<P>(B) Restored to 500, if the Air Resources Board has determined that voluntary ridesharing and other replacement measures have only achieved the emission reduction levels that would have been achieved by employers with less than 500 employees, exempted pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) and subparagraph (b)(3)(A); or
<P>(C) Restored to 250, if the Air Resources Board has determined that voluntary ridesharing and other replacement measures have only achieved the emission reduction levels that would have been achieved by employers with less than 250 employees exempted pursuant to paragraph (b)(2): or
<P>(D) Restored to 100, if the Air Resources Board has determined that voluntary ridesharing and other replacement measures have not achieved the emission reduction levels that would have been achieved by employers with less than 250 employees exempted pursuant to paragraph (b)(2).
<P>(E) On or before June 1 of each year the applicability threshold of Rule 2202 shall be adjusted pursuant to subparagraphs (b)(5)(B) through (b)(5)(D) of this rule depending on what finding the Air Resources Board has made concerning whether voluntary ridesharing and other replacement measures have achieved equivalent emission reductions to those that would have been achieved by exempted employers.
<P><LI> Six months prior to the effective dates specified in paragraphs (b)(3), (b)(4) and (b)(5), the South Coast Air Quality Management District (District) and the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) shall report to the ARB on the effectiveness of the voluntary rideshare and other replacement measures in terms of achieving equivalent level of emission reductions as the exempted employers of Rule 2202.  If there is a difference between the District and SCAG concerning the emissions reduced by replacement measures, the Air Resources Board shall determine if these measures have fully achieved the emission reductions that would have been achieved by the exempt employers.
<P><LI> If Rule 2202 is repealed, pursuant to paragraph (b)(5)(A), beginning January 1, 2002, and each year thereafter, SCAG shall report to the District on the effectiveness of the voluntary rideshare efforts.  The District, based on information provided by SCAG and other sources, shall determine whether the alternative measures are achieving equivalent emission reductions.  In the event there is a shortfall in emission reductions, the District shall implement Rule 2202 as a backstop, to the extent needed to make up the shortfall.</OL>
<P><B>(c) Sunset Provision</B>
<BR>This rule shall be rescinded on December 31, 1998 or earlier, provided that a replacement measure is implemented which produces an equivalent level of emission reductions and such emission reductions are real, quantifiable, and surplus relative to the most recently adopted state implementation plan.<S> </S>

<BR>Any person may implement a mobile source offset program in accordance with the provisions of Regulations XVI other than paragraphs (f)(1), (2), and (3) of this rule.
<P><LI> Emission Reduction Credits (ERC) from Stationary Sources
<BR>Any person may elect to use Emission Reduction Credits (ERC) generated from stationary sources after January 1, 1996, in accordance with the provisions of Regulation XIII.
<P><LI> Air Quality Investment Program (AQIP)
<BR>Notwithstanding other provisions of this rule, employers may participate in the air quality investment program by submitting an air quality investment, to be placed in a restricted fund, as follows:
<P>(A) Annually submit $60 for each employee reporting to work in the peak window; or
<P>(B) Triennially submit $125 for each employee reporting to work in the peak window.
<P>The District shall use these funds to obtain an emission reduction or air quality benefit that is equivalent to the sum of the ERTs for all participating employers in the AQIP.  The air quality investment fees shall be valid until July 1, 1996.  At such time the air quality investment fees shall be subject to Rule 306, and evaluated and adjusted annually to reflect market forces.
<P><LI> Other Emission Reduction Strategies
<BR>Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, any employer may receive credit toward its ERT for any emission reduction strategy that the employer or other person demonstrates to the Executive Office achieves real, quantifiable, enforceable, and surplus emission reductions for a discrete period of time.  Such strategies may include, but are not limited to, the reduction of non-work trips, other vehicle or engine accelerated turnover programs, investments in clean fuel infrastructure, clean fuel fleet purchases or conversion as specified in Regulation XVI, the provision of new vehicle purchase subsidies or discounts, and local community or development projects that reduce trip or energy demand or that expand clean fuel or high-occupancy travel options.  The Executive Officer shall not approve an alternative emission reduction program unless it is consistent with other District regulations and Governing Board policies, and shall consider guidelines established by the California Air Resources Board and the Environmental Protection Agency.</OL>
<P><B>(g) Vehicle Trip Emission Credits (VTEC)</B>
<BR>Employers may elect to implement any of the following strategies and obtain vehicle trip emission credits that can be applied towards their ERT.  Such actions are at the sole discretion of the employer.

<P><LI> Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) Reduction Programs
<BR>Subject to approval of the Executive Officer or designee, employers may elect to implement VMT reduction programs and receive VTEC towards their ERT.  Reduction of annual employee commute VMT may result from employment center relocation, video-conference centers, telecommuting centers or other alternative programs approved by the Executive Officer or designee.  The Executive Officer shall not offer any VTEC for a VMT reduction program unless it includes baseline VMT estimates and demonstrates that VMT reductions result in real, quantifiable, and surplus emission reductions.
<P><LI> Parking Cash-Out Program
<BR>Employers may elect to implement a Parking Cash-Out Program to reduce employee commutes and receive VTEC toward their ERT.  Parking Cash-Out is a program where an employer offers to provide a cash allowance to an employee, equivalent to the parking subsidy that the employer would otherwise pay to provide the employee with a parking space.  Incorporation of the Parking Cash-Out Program as one of the options in Rule 2202, does not relieve the affected parties from complying with the provisions of the Health and Safety Code section 43845 (AB 2109-Katz).</OL>
<P><B>(h) General Emissions Credit Provisions:</B>
<BR>The following provisions shall apply to any of the emission credit strategies identified in this rule:
<P><OL><LI> An employer or other person seeking credit under this rule may use actual annual mileage per vehicle, or alternative estimates of vehicle miles traveled (VMT) contained in Rule 2202 - On Road Motor Vehicle Mitigation Options Implementation Guidelines (adopted December 8, 1995).
<P><LI> Emission credit strategies that do not provide the precise amount of surplus emission reductions for each of the three pollutants addressed by this rule (VOC, NO<sub>x</sub>, and CO) may still qualify for equivalent credit if the employer provides equivalent credits obtained pursuant to paragraph (h)(3) or the District achieves equivalent reductions through the Air Quality Investment Program.
<P><LI> Any person holding surplus emission credits, other than vehicle trip emission credits (VTEC), pursuant to this rule may trade some or all of the those credits to other employers.
<P><LI> Upon the expiration of this rule, any unused emission credits may be applied to other emission reduction programs pursuant to and consistent with District rules and regulations.</OL>
<P><B>(i) Program Administration</B>
<BR>Rule 2202 shall be administered according to the following:
<P><OL><LI>Employers shall register with the District to implement an annual Emission Reduction Program for each worksite.  Employers shall commence implementation of the approved Emission Reduction Program within 60 days of approval by the Executive Officer.  Existing Rule 1501 plans or Rule 1501.1 options shall remain in effect until an Emission Reduction Program is implemented.  The registration shall include the following information:
<P>(A) The name of the highest ranking company official, the name of the contact person, company address, telephone numbers for all participating worksites;
<P>(B) The on-road vehicle mitigation option(s) that will be used;
<P>(C) The total number of employees that report to work in the peak window;
<P>(D) The total number of employees at that worksite; and,
<P>(E) Calculations for VOC, NO<sub>x</sub>, and CO emission reductions for any of the on-road vehicle mitigation options in subdivision (f) or the vehicle trip emission credit options in subdivision (g).
<P><LI> Employers shall renew their registration annually.  Annual registration shall include changes in employment base and any other changes that would necessitate adjustment in emission reduction targets or program implementation.
<P><LI> Employers may request to amend their Emission Reduction Program at any time and implement the amendments with written approval of the Executive Officer subject to the criteria contained in paragraph (i)(1).
<P><LI> Rather than registering with the District for each individual worksite, an employer may submit a single registration to implement an Emission Reduction Program that meets the aggregated ERT of several sites.
<P><LI> Emission credits obtained pursuant to subdivision (f) or (g) shall be surrendered to the Executive Officer within the first  six months of the approval of the registration forms. The Executive Officer may grant extensions not to exceed six months on a case by case basis upon a finding that earlier compliance would present an unreasonable hardship.
<P><LI> Records which document the accuracy and validity of all information submitted to the District as required by this rule shall be kept by the employer for a minimum of three years and made available upon request during normal business hours.
<P><LI> On a quarterly basis the Executive Officer shall recommend to the District&#146;s Governing Board the release of monies from the AQIP restricted fund.  The program shall be administered and consideration of proposals shall be subject to the following:
<P>(A) Proposals shall be accepted on an ongoing basis;
<P>(B) Equal consideration shall be given to cost-effective proposals and those that achieve long-term advancement of mobile source technology;
<P>(C) The amount of emission reductions required to demonstrate equivalent emission reductions shall be determined on a quarterly basis;
<P>(D) The allocation of funding shall be recommended for proposals that reduce equivalent emissions within each county proportional to the contribution level of employers within each county to the greatest extent feasible; and,
<P>(E) The emissions reductions are demonstrated to be real, quantifiable, enforceable, and surplus, in accordance with the Rule 2202 - On-Road Motor Vehicle Mitigation Options Implementation Guidelines (adopted December 8, 1995).
<P><LI> Registration forms submitted by employers shall be subject to the fee schedule set forth in subdivisions (c) and (d) of Rule 306.  Employers choosing to implement the Employee Commute Reduction Program under paragraph (l)(3) shall be subject to the fee schedule set forth in Rule 308.
<P><LI> Any employer subject to Rule 2202 or to the exemptions of paragraph (l)(3) of this rule shall comply with the requirements of paragraphs (e)(2), (3), (4) and subdivision (k) of Regulation VII - Air Pollution Emergencies.</OL>
<P><B>(j) Previously Delegated Programs</B>
<BR>Any employer that is in compliance with an ordinance adopted by a local government that has a trip reduction ordinance that was approved by the District prior to the effective date of this rule, and that has an existing memorandum of agreement with the District, shall be deemed in compliance with this rule.
<P><B>(k) Delegation to Local Governments</B>
<BR>The District may delegate authority to implement all or part of Rule 2202, except for the provisions of paragraph (f)(7), to any local government that satisfies the following criteria:
<P><OL><LI> The local government adopts an ordinance that is at least as stringent as Rule 2202 in the following areas:
<P>(A) Applicability;
<P>(B) Emission reductions target;
<P>(C) Vehicle trip emission credit calculations;
<P>(D) Annual registration; and
<P>(E) Recordkeeping.
<P><LI> The local government demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Executive Officer that:
<P>(A) It has an implementation plan providing adequate resources to adopt and enforce the ordinance; and
<P>(B) Multiple site employers with more than one regulated worksite in the District have the option of complying with the District rule instead of the local ordinance.
<P><LI> The local government has executed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Executive Officer specifying the procedures to monitor and review performance of the local government in implementing the program, and procedures for revocation of delegation if the Executive Officer determines that performance of the local government is inadequate.</OL>
<P><B>(l) Exemptions</B>
<P><OL><LI> Employee Threshold
<BR>Any employer whose employee population at the worksite decreases to fewer than 100 employees or the applicable threshold for the prior consecutive six month period, calculated as a monthly average; or fewer than 33 employees are scheduled to report to work Monday through Friday between 6-10 AM for the prior consecutive 90 days, may submit a written request to the Executive Officer or designee to be exempted from this rule.  Employers must submit a registration form not later than 90 days after they know or should have known that they no longer qualify for this exemption.
<P><LI> Declared Bankruptcy
<BR>An employer who has declared bankruptcy, for the official business or governmental operations of its organization or company, through a judicial court filing and confirmation process, may request the Executive Officer to grant a temporary waiver from complying with the requirements of this rule.  Upon demonstration of the filing and confirmation of bankruptcy, the Executive Officer will grant an exemption for the duration of bankruptcy, not to exceed two (2) years, from the date of the waiver.
<P><LI> Employee Commute Reduction Program
<BR>Rather than comply with the provisions of subdivision (e) of this rule, employers may elect to implement an employee commute reduction program that demonstrates conformance with the Employee Commute Reduction Program Guidelines (adopted December 8, 1995).
<P>(A) Performance Goal
<BR>Employers must provide a program that will be reasonably likely to result in achieving their average vehicle ridership goal within three years.  The goals shall be as follows: 1.75 for Performance Target Zone 1; 1.5 for Performance Target Zone 2; and 1.3 for Performance Target Zone 3.
<P>(B) Supplemental Strategies
<BR>Notwithstanding the above, an employer may elect to supplement its Employee Commute Reduction Program with any strategy listed in subdivisions (f) or (g) in order to achieve their goal.
<P><LI> Renewal Date
<P>(A) The currently approved Rule 1501 Employee Trip Reduction Plan may remain in effect until the biennial renewal date.
<P>(B) The currently approved Rule 1501.1 Registration may remain in effect until the annual renewal date.
<P><LI> Primary and Secondary School Districts and Schools
<BR>Any public or private primary or secondary school district or school that buses two (2) students for every one (1) peak window employee at worksites subject to the rule is exempt from Rule 2202, according to the following criteria:
<P>(A) School districts and schools shall keep records demonstrating the maintenance of this ratio on-site and make them available upon request by the Executive Officer or designee; and
<P>(B) On a case by case basis, the Executive Officer or designee may approve a request by a school district or school to modify the default student-to-employee ratio to reflect location, trip length and other school district or school specific busing program characteristics in order to maintain equivalency with emission reductions which would occur if the district or school met its emission reduction goals under Rule 2202; and
<P>(C) The Executive Officer may periodically update and publish the default student-to-employee ratio to reflect changes to revised emission factors published by the California Air Resources Board.
<P>School districts and schools may opt not to be exempt but to implement a Rule 2202 program and claim credit for surplus emission reduction credits earned through a student busing program and other Rule 2202 compliance options.
<P><LI> Primary and Secondary School District Financial Hardship
<BR>Due to their financial hardship, notwithstanding the criteria of paragraph (l)(5), school districts that have received a Negative or Qualified Certification status from their County Board of Education pursuant to Chapter 6, Part 24 of Division 3 of the Education Code, deeming that based upon current projections the school district or county office of education will not or may not meet its financial obligations, may request the Executive Officer to grant a temporary exemption from the requirements of the rule.  The Executive Officer shall grant a temporary exemption for the period during which the Negative or Qualified Certification status applies.
<P><LI> Adjustments for Employers Exempt Pursuant to SB 836
<P>(A) The Executive Officer shall refund to employers of worksites with less than 250 employees, that have participated in the AQIP or surrendered MSERCs, a prorated share of their AQIP or MSERC contribution, respectively, that corresponds to the compliance period that extends beyond December 31, 1996.
<P>(B) Employers with worksites of less than 250 employees whose triennial plan or annual update under the Employee Commute Reduction Program option is due between September 1, 1996 and December 31, 1996 may submit in lieu of a triennial plan or update an employer AVR survey taken within the six months prior to the plan due date, and shall be exempt from payment of any transportation plan fees for this rule.</OL>
<P><B>(m) Emission Factors</B>
<BR>The following emission factors, which shall be used in calculations pursuant to this rule, are based on California Air Resources Board&#146;s EMFAC 7F emission factor model and BURDEN 7F vehicle activity model. These emission factors shall be revised upon publication by the California Air Resources Board of final revised emission factors.
<P><OL><LI> Employee Emission Reduction Factors
<BR>The following employee emission reduction factors (pounds per year per employee) shall be used in determining the Emission Reduction Target with respect to the worksite Performance Target Zone.  The Performance Target Zone is determined by the worksite location within the geographic boundaries as described in Attachment I and the Rule 2202 - On-Road Motor Vehicle Mitigation Options Implementation Guidelines (adopted December 8, 1995).

<P>
Rule 2202 has been designed to reduce emissions from mobile sources.
 The rule provides employers with a menu of options that they
can choose from to implement and meet the emission reduction target
(ERT) for their worksite.
<P>
The purpose of this document is to provide guidelines for compliance
with the provisions of Rule 2202.  The various emissions reduction
strategies and trip reduction strategies  currently contained
in the rule that employers can implement and receive credit towards
their ERT's are listed in the Table below.

As an alternative to meeting the ERT at their worksite the rule
allows the employers optional implementation of an Employee Commute
Reduction Program. Implementation details of this strictly optional
program are included in the Employee Commute Reduction Program
Guidelines.  This document outlines the framework, calculation
methodology, and criteria used in determining emission reductions
credits and vehicle trip emission credits (VTECs<U>)</U> that
can be applied towards meeting emission reduction targets (ERT

Reduction Target (ERT)</A>
<P>
Employers subject to Rule 2202 are required to implement an emission
reduction program and meet an annual Emission Reduction Target
(ERT) for Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC), Oxides of Nitrogen
(NOx) and Carbon Monoxide (CO).  Figure 1-1 outlines the equation
used to determine the emissions reduction target for each pollutant.
 A complete discussion on emissions reduction is contained in
Appendix A.

Considered</A>
<P>
Vehicle trips are responsible for the emissions of volatile organic
compounds (VOC), oxides of nitrogen (NOX), and carbon monoxide
(CO).  Most trip reduction programs reduce emissions by similar
relative amounts.  Emission reduction strategies, however, aimed
primarily at reducing emissions rather than trips, may reduce
emissions by different relative amounts.  Rule 2202 is designed
to  reduce emissions of VOC, NOX, and CO, by an equal or greater
amount to that achievable through trip reduction.  Rule 2202 allows
employers to select and implement a combination of emission reduction
strategies and meet the site-specific ERTs for VOC, NOx and CO.

REDUCTION STRATEGIES</A>
<P>
The emission reduction  strategies considered in this document
include, old vehicle scrapping, clean on-road vehicles, clean
off-road vehicles, remote sensing, other mobile source emission
credits, emission reduction credits (ERC) from stationary sources
and air quality investment.  In addition, companies can meet the
emission reduction requirements, in whole or in part, by  obtaining
sufficient VTECs.
<P>
<A NAME="_Toc339336711"></A><A NAME="_Toc339504045"></A><A NAME="_Toc339504613"></A><A NAME="_Toc339504931"></A><A NAME="_Toc339518625"></A><A NAME="_Toc339518695"></A><A NAME="_Toc339518756"></A><A NAME="_Toc339518853"></A><A NAME="_Toc339523610"></A><A NAME="_Toc339718920"></A><A NAME="_Toc339763593"></A><A NAME="_Toc339765295"></A><A NAME="_Toc339767185"></A><A NAME="_Toc343577201">Old
Vehicle Scrapping</A>
<P>
The concept behind old vehicle scrapping programs relies on the
disproportionate impact of gross polluting vehicles on air quality.
 Some inventory estimates place responsibility for as much as
half of the mobile source emissions on earlier model vehicles,
which represent less than one fifth of the overall vehicle population.
 Substantial emission reductions would therefore be gained by
retiring these high polluting older vehicles and replacing them
with cleaner ones.
<P>
AQMD adopted Rule 1610 - Old Vehicle Scrapping, on January 8,
1993, as a Mobile Source Emission Reduction Credit (MSERC) program.
 Under this rule, amended on October 13, 1995, stationary sources
are allowed to purchase and scrap pre-'82 vehicles, which meet
minimum qualifying criteria, for the purpose of obtaining MSERCs.
 These MSERCs could then be used to comply with the AQMD's stationary
source rules, including RECLAIM and Rule 2202.  The MSERCs are
issued according to the model year of the vehicles scrapped, with
more credits issued for the earliest years (pre-'72).
<P>
Rule 2202 offers employers the opportunity to obtain VTECs from
the implementation of the following optional trip reduction strategies.
 These VTECs, obtained through peak-commute trip reductions, other
work-related trip reduction, alternate fuel vehicle offsets, vehicle
miles traveled (VMT) offsets or employee commute reduction programs,
can be applied towards meeting an employer's ERT. 
<P>
The old vehicle scrapping results in different relative emission
reductions of VOC, NOx and CO compared to work commute trips.
 Employers that implement old vehicle scrapping and end up with
surplus emission reductions with respect to some of the pollutants
can bank these credits for up to five years and use them towards
their future ERT, or trade them to other employers.  Alternatively,
employers that have a shortfall in meeting their ERTs can purchase
surplus MSERCs from other employers.

On-Road Vehicles</A>
<P>
Rule 1612 - Credits for Clean On-Road vehicles provides opportunities
to generate NOx, VOC, CO, PM10, and SOx mobile source emission
credits (MSERC) that can be used for compliance with District
regulations. Employers subject to Rule 2202 can use MSERCs obtained
pursuant to Rule 1612 towards meeting an emission reduction target.
 These credits would be generated based on voluntary emission
reductions created by the operation of low- or zero-emission on-road
vehicles within the boundaries of the District that result in
emission reductions beyond those required by local, state and
federal regulations.
<P>

Off-Road Vehicles</A>
<P>
Clean Off-Road vehicles may be implemented, in accordance with
District Rule 1620 - Credits for Clean Off-Road vehicles, to obtain
and apply Mobile Source Emission Credits (MSERCs) towards meeting
an emission reduction target.  Rule 1620 provides opportunities
to generate NOx, VOC, CO, PM10, and SOx MSERCs that can be used
for compliance with District regulations. These credits would
be generated based on voluntary emission reductions created by
the operation of low or zero-emission off-road equipment within
the jurisdiction of the District that result in emission reductions
beyond those required by local, state, and federal regulations.

Sensing</A>
<P>
Remote sensing devices are emissions monitoring devices that are
used in conjunction with an emissions limitation standard.  Remote
sensing can be used to enhance the effectiveness of existing tailpipe
standards, and can also be used to identify &quot;gross polluters.&quot;
 The emissions reduction potential of this strategy results from
the subsequent vehicle maintenance performed on the identified
high-emitting vehicles.  Remote sensing improves efficiency of
inspection and maintenance programs.  Credit for any improved
inspection and maintenance program would have to go beyond the
requirements of existing state and federal programs to avoid &quot;double-counting&quot;
the emission reductions.   Emission reductions generated through
the implementation of remote sensing at the employer's worksite
as well as other sites can be credited towards the employer's
emission reduction target.
<P>
Under Rule 2202, employers are to submit to the AQMD Executive
Officer, for approval, a proposed emissions reduction quantification
methodology.  The methodology will include baseline emissions
estimates and pollutant reductions after repair.  Employers have
the option to either track actual mileage accumulation or use
AQMD provided default annual mileage accumulations by vehicle
age, to quantify emissions reductions.  These are shown in the
Table:VI-5 (Appendix B).
<P>
Where
<P>
Pre-Repair = Measured emission rate prior to repair work.
<P>
Post-Repair = Measured emission rate immediately following repair
work.
<P>
Miles Traveled = Number of miles traveled following repair work
until the    next regularly scheduled California Inspection and
    Maintenance Smog Check.

<P>
Any person may elect to use Emission Reduction Credits (ERC) generated
by stationary sources after January  1, 1996, in accordance with
the provisions of Regulation XIII - New Source Review.  Regulation
XIII sets forth the requirements that proposed new or modified
stationary sources must meet before construction can take place.
 These requirements are in addition to those specified by other
rules and include use of Best Available Control Technology, and
use of ERC to offset any emission increases.  Employers may reduce
emissions through the installation of air pollution control technologies,
process modifications, or equipment shutdowns and generate ERCs
and apply them towards meeting the ERT for their site or trade
them to other employers or stationary sources.

Quality Investment</A>
<P>
The concept of an air quality investment program is based on relative
cost effectiveness.  Employers  may participate in the air quality
investment program  by submitting an air quality investment, to
be place in a restricted fund as follows:
<P>
(A) Annually submit $60 for each employee reporting to work in
the peak  window; or 
<P>
(B) Triennially submit $125 for each employee reporting to work
in the peak  window.
<P>
 The AQMD Executive Officer will recommend to the AQMD Governing
Board, for approval, on a quarterly basis, the release of monies
from the restricted fund for emissions reductions programs that
achieve equivalent emissions reductions.
<P>
Proposals for using monies from the restricted fund will be accepted
by the AQMD Executive Officer on an ongoing basis.  The AQMD Executive
Officer will determine the amount of mobile source emission reductions
required to demonstrate equivalent emissions reductions and the
amount that will be achieved by the proposal.  The Executive Officer
will then recommend the most cost-effective proposals that achieve
equivalent mobile source emissions reductions.  In addition, the
Executive Officer will recommend that the allocation of funding
for proposals that reduce equivalent emissions within each county
be proportional to the contribution level of employers within
each county.  On a quarterly basis, the Executive Officer will
provide to the AQMD Governing Board a status report on program
effectiveness and the balance of monies in the fund.

will result in real reductions is in establishing a proper emissions
or trip baseline level.  If, for example,  facility XYZ has reduced
emissions in excess of those required by the Emissions Reduction
Target (ERT), no &quot;real&quot; reductions will result from
the establishment of (ERT) as a performance standard.  Therefore,
all quantification methodologies will be required to establish
a standardized baseline condition, or use a default condition
established by the Executive Officer, from which to calculate
real emissions or trip reductions.

</A><A NAME="_Toc343577211">Surplus Reductions</A>
<P>
&quot;Surplus&quot; reductions occur when an action is taken beyond
existing and planned regional, state, and federal requirements.
 Obtaining surplus emission reductions means the benefit of a
control strategy is not &quot;double counted.&quot;  In many cases,
the proposed strategy requirements overlap completely with another
rule, regulation, statute, or legislation.  However, by revising
the strategy to become more stringent, the action would become
partially creditable, or surplus.  To meet this surplus criterion,
all quantification methodologies will be required to include a
mechanism for subtracting any regulatory overlaps with the standardized
baselines established to meet the &quot;real&quot; criterion described
earlier.

</A><A NAME="_Toc343577212">Quantifiable Reductions</A></B>
<P>
Although TCM strategies involve some degree of variance and uncertainty,
creditable actions can be quantified through use of assumptions
that are based either on case studies or on transportation supply
and demand theories.  Each assumption that is used to assign effectiveness
or efficiency should be matched with either a case study, or on
some measurable parameter.  Basic &quot;intuition,&quot; especially
for indirect actions such as general education, &quot;goodwill,&quot;
or other &quot;good faith efforts,&quot; is not sufficient.  Quantifiability
is the main criterion used to determine the extent of any credit
discounting.  Those actions which are more easily quantified,
with strong assumptions, would have limited discounting applied,
while the more &quot;intuitive&quot; actions would need to be
discounted to a much greater extent.
<P>
In addition, each proposed program should include a recordkeeping
mechanism for compliance verification, as outlined in Chapter
3.  Any proposed program may be submitted in combination with
other programs, including a remote sensing, old vehicle scrapping,
or work-related trip reduction program.

The main focus of Rule 1501 has been the employee commute trip.
 Rule 2202 provides the option to obtain credit for reducing such
trips.  Specifically, employers can reduce trips to work that
occur during the morning peak congestion period (or &quot;Peak

<P>
<B>Trips per Vehicle Adjustment Factor</B>
<P>
The trips per vehicle adjustment factor, for the purposes of Rule
2202<STRIKE>,</STRIKE> is equal to 2.0 trips per daily commute
vehicle.  This factor accounts for the trip to work and the return
trip home.
<P>
<B>Adjustment Factor</B>
<P>
Due to the differences in emission rates due to travel demand
and vehicle speeds, trip reductions are subject to a trip adjustment
factor of 1.15 for trips reduced outside of the a.m. peak period.
<P>
<B>Conversion Factor</B>
<P>
Rule 2202 combines the trips per vehicle adjustment factor (TPV)
with the adjustment factor to meet a standardized trip (ADJ(CTR))
and presents the product of the two variables as an overall conversion
factor (CF), as follows:
<P>
 CF = TPV x ADJ(CTR) 
<P>
Therefore, with a TPV equal to 2.0 and an ADJ of 1.0 for a.m.
peak period trips and 1.15 for other trips, the conversion factor
is equal to:
<P>
 CF = 2.0 x 1.0
<P>
   2.0   (for a.m. peak window trips)
<P>
 CF = 2.0 x 1.15
<P>
  = 2.30  (trips outside the a.m. peak window)
<P>
<A NAME="_Toc343577231">Emission Credits From Old Vehicle Scrapping</A>
<P>
An Old Vehicle Scrapping Program implemented in accordance to
Rule 1610 will result in the generation of MSERCs, per Table V-5,
that can be consumed within five years.  Employers can apply/use
MSERCs obtained from an Old Vehicle Scrapping Program towards
demonstrating compliance with their ERTs for three years.  The
old vehicle scrapping results in different relative emission reductions
of VOC, NOx and CO compared to work commute trips.  Employers
that implement old vehicle scrapping and end up with surplus emission
reductions with respect to some of the pollutants can bank these
credits for up to five years and use them towards their future
ERT, or trade them to other employers.  Alternatively, employers
that have a shortfall in meeting their ERTs can purchase surplus
MSERCs from other employers.
<P>
MSERCs generated from old vehicle scrapping activities shall be
valid for five years with the limitation that no more than one-third
of the MSERCs may be consumed within one year from the date of
approval and not more than two-thirds of the MSERCs may be consumed
within two years from the date of approval.  This also applies
to credits that have been issued for old vehicle scrapping activities
prior to October 13, 1995 provided that these credits have not
expired or have not been consumed.

Generation</A></B>
<P>
Motor vehicles are responsible for the generation of VOC, NOX,
and CO emissions.  These pollutants are linked to either the combustion
process of the engine or to the evaporation of the motor fuel
from the storage and delivery system.  These processes can be
further categorized into different operating modes of the vehicle.
 Combustion emissions are usually higher during start-up, and
are even higher during &quot;cold&quot; starts, since the vehicle's
emission control device operates more efficiently at elevated
temperatures.  In addition, since the rate of evaporation increases
at higher temperatures, more emissions result during the &quot;hot
soak&quot; period following a trip.  Table V-1 below lists the
vehicle trip generated emission sources.

And BURDEN Models
<P>
AQMD relies on the California Air Resources Board (ARB) EMFAC
computer model to produce emission factors which are then used
as input into ARB's BURDEN computer program to generate emissions
inventories.  The emissions inventories can then be categorized,
for reduction quantification purposes, into a trip component,
and a VMT component.
<P>
<B>Trip Component</B>
<P>
The emission sources categorized as a trip component include the
start ignition emissions, and the hot soak evaporation emissions.
 Emissions from these sources are therefore represented as pounds
(grams) per trip.
<P>
<B>VMT Component</B>
<P>
The emission sources categorized as VMT components include the
running exhaust, and running loss emissions.  Emissions from these
sources are represented as pounds (grams) per vehicle mile travelled.
<P>
<B>Resting and Diurnal Evaporation</B>
<P>
The remaining emissions are not attributed to trip reduction programs;
resting and diurnal evaporation occur at a rate independent from
the vehicle's trip or vehicle miles travelled rate.

and other parameters, as determined by the ARB BURDEN and EMFAC
computer models, are accurate and representative for the years,
1995, 2000, and 2010.
<P>
3. The parameters generated by BURDEN are accurately represented
by linear interpolation for the intermediate years between 1995
and 2010.
<P>
4. The average work-trip length, according to the Commuter Transportation
Services 1993 State of the Commute, is accurate and representative,
and equal to 15 miles.
<P>
5. Reactive organic gas emissions from diurnal and resting loss
evaporation are constant and independent from the vehicle trip
or vehicle miles travelled rate.
<P>
6. Commuting vehicles operate primarily in cold start mode.
<P>
7. The number of annual operating days for commute vehicles equal
to 260 days per year, as presented in the ARB draft document,
An Emissions Formula for Employer-Based Trip Reductions (January
1995), is accurate and representative.
<P>
8. The ARB BURDEN model produces emissions inventories corresponding
to six time periods.  Two of these correspond to the morning and
afternoon peak commute periods (i.e., 6 a.m.- 9 a.m. and 3 p.m.
- 6 p.m.).  These two period-specific emission inventories, with
corresponding vehicle miles travelled, were used to develop grams
per miles emission rates.
<P>
9. Trip end emissions are based on overall South Coast Air Basin
Inventories.
<P>
10. Annual average emission factors were determined based on ARB
BURDEN ozone planning and CO planning inventories, based on the
following weighted average: (7/12 x ozone planning inventory)
+ (5/12 x CO planning inventory).
<P>
<B>Methodology</B>
<P>
Annual emissions per daily commute vehicle are therefore, for
each pollutant and year:
<P>
 Where  TPV = Trips per Daily Vehicle<BR>
   dpy = Days per Year

Factor Data</A>
<P>
Tables V-2,3 and 4 were developed based on the ARB BURDEN model
output.  These values were used to derive the daily commute vehicle
emission factor.  The calculated emission factor represents emissions
from light-duty vehicles (LDV), which are considered to be passenger
cars and light duty trucks, since both are used for work commute
purposes.

a direct written contract or agreement with an employer to perform
certain services and is not on the employer's payroll.
<LI>LOW-INCOME EMPLOYEE means an individual whose salary is equal
to, or less than, the current individual income level set in the
California Code of Regulations, Title 25, Section 6932, as lower
income for the county in which the employer is based.  Higher
income employees may be considered to be &quot;low-income&quot;
if the employees demonstrate that the program strategy would create
a substantial economic burden..
<LI>PART-TIME EMPLOYEE means any employee who reports to a worksite
on a part-time basis fewer than 32 hours per week, but more than

<B>PREFACE</B>
<P>
The Employee Commute Reduction Program (ECRP) is an optional exemption
under Rule 2202 in lieu of primary compliance alternatives.  This
program is designed to meet ambient air quality standards mandated
by the federal Clean Air Act.  As an indirect mobile source emission
control strategy it is intended to reduce vehicle miles traveled
and increase the average vehicle ridership (AVR) of work related
trips.  Therefore, there is a concurrent reduction in pollutant
emissions.
<P>
Rule 2202 and the guidelines for the ECRP are consistent with
the Health and Safety Code Section 40717 which establishes compliance
requirements for California transportation performance standards.

<P>
Rule 2202 has been designed to reduce or mitigate mobile source
emissions from employee commuting.  The rule provides employers
with a menu of emission reduction strategies that employers can
implement to meet an emission reduction target (ERT) for their
worksite.  As an alternative to meeting an ERT, Rule 2202 under
paragraph (i)(3), allows employers the option to implement an
Employee Commute Reduction Program and be deemed in compliance
with the rule.  
<P>
This document has been prepared to assist employers in understanding
the development and implementation requirements of the Employee
Commute Reduction Program at their worksite.  The Employee Commute
Reduction Program focuses on reducing work related vehicle trips
and vehicle miles traveled at a worksite with the purpose of improving
and/or maintaining average vehicle ridership (AVR). 
<P>
AQMD staff is available to answer questions and to provide assistance
to employers who are developing and implementing programs.  The
entire guidance document should be read in order to fully understand
the program requirements.  Direct any questions concerning these
guidelines to your assigned Transportation Specialist or to the

<P>
The preparation of a Employee Commute Reduction Program is expected
to lead to achievement and maintenance of the employer's AVR target
by reducing the number of work related vehicle trips and vehicle
miles traveled.  This program can be implemented by any employer
that employs 100 or more employees at a worksite, on a full or
part-time basis, calculated as a monthly average over the prior
six consecutive months. 
<P>
Each monthly employee population for the prior consecutive six
months is added and then divided by six to determine whether the
employer's average employee population figure is 100 or more.
<P>
Employers with 100 or more employees should notify the AQMD in
writing, in order to participate in this program, and include
the following information:
<UL>
<LI>employer's name;
<LI>business and mailing address of the worksite; and
<LI>name of the highest ranking official at the worksite.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
Once notified, the AQMD will forward a notification letter to
the employer, and within 90 days from receipt of the letter the
employer must submit a program.

<UL>
<LI>Employee Commute Reduction Programs will be approved provided
the program complies with all requirements of Rules 2202, 306
and 308 (filing fees); 
<LI>Employer continues to demonstrate a good faith effort towards
achieving target AVR;
<LI>Direct financial awards are not required for program approval;
<LI>Within 90 calendar days of receipt of the program, the AQMD
will in writing, approve, disapprove the program, or request up
to 30 additional days to review the program, indicating to the
employer the reasons for requiring additional review time;
<LI>Prior to disapproving a program, the AQMD will contact the
employer to provide an opportunity to discuss program inadequacies;
<LI>If a program is disapproved, the reasons for disapproval will
be given in writing to the employer.  Any program disapproved
by the AQMD must be revised by the employer and resubmitted to
the District within 30 calendar days of receipt of the notice
of disapproval.  If a second disapproval notice is given, the
employer is in violation of Rule 2202 until a revised program
is submitted and approved by AQMD.  The AQMD has 90 days to review
the resubmitted program; and 
<LI>An Employee Commute Reduction Program will be disapproved
if the program demonstrates a disproportionate impact on minorities,
women, low-income or disabled employees.  A program will not be
disapproved if it includes such provisions as are necessary to
ensure a reasonable opportunity for employees to commute by means
other than a single-occupant vehicle, and avoids such disproportionate
impacts.  The AQMD shall provide the employer an opportunity to
review and respond in writing to information submitted by an employee
representative or employee organization in accordance with these
guidelines.  The burden of proof that a program should be disapproved
rests with the employee, employee representative, or employee
organization submitting the information.

the majority of the total trip  distance.
<P>
(+) Vanpools are counted as 7-15 people traveling together for
the majority of the total trip  distance.  The credit is given
by dividing the actual number of occupants in the vehicle  by
the maximum occupancy of the vehicle.
<P>
(+) Employees walking, bicycling, telecommuting, using public
transit, buspooling,  using a zero emissions vehicle, or on their
day off under a compressed work week,  should be counted as employees
arriving at the worksite with no vehicle. 
<P>
(+) Noncommuting AVR credit is allowed for employees who remain
at the worksite (if in  the District's jurisdiction), or entirely
out of the District's jurisdiction, for at least one  day, to
complete work assignments, and generate no vehicle trips during
the AVR  window associated with arriving at the worksite.  Noncommuting
AVR credit is  calculated as arriving at the worksite with no
vehicle. 
<P>
(+) AVR credit for all employees leaving the worksite, during
the window, may be  calculated and averaged with employees arriving
at the worksite during the window to  obtain an aggregate AVR.
 Such credit can be taken initially only in a triennial  program.
<P>
(+) Additional credit toward an employer's AVR target will be
granted for the use of  natural gas-, methanol-, propane-, liquefied
petroleum gas-, or electric-fueled  vehicles by employees for
work commute trips that have been certified and or  approved by
the CARB to have met the Transitional Low Emission Vehicle (TLEV),
 Low Emission Vehicle (LEV), Ultra Low Emission Vehicle (ULEV)

Survey Parameters</A>
<P>
The AVR survey data cannot be more than 6 months old at the time
of program submittal.  The response rate to the survey must be
at least 60 percent of those employees who report to the worksite
during the window.  The remaining non-responses over 60 percent
to 100 percent shall be treated as single occupant vehicle commuters.
 However, if an employer achieves a 90 percent response rate or
higher, the remaining non-response percentage can be reported
in the &quot;Other&quot; category in the survey.  The net affect
on the AVR calculation will be neutral. 
<P>
The survey period cannot contain a National or State Holiday,
and cannot be taken during California Rideshare Week.  The holidays
to be excluded from survey weeks are as follows:
<P>
New Years Day     January 1

Each employer should encourage employee involvement in either
of the following ways:  through an employee survey that includes
questions soliciting suggestions for program improvement and/or
strategies which may be used for Employee Commute Reduction Program
development; or an employer may implement a program which actively
involves employees, such as focus groups, employee committees,
etc.

Period for AVR Calculation</A>
<P>
The employer should calculate the AVR based on the 6:00 a.m. -
10:00 a.m., Monday through Friday window except for businesses
operating 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  The AVR window for businesses
operating 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, is the period of time,
Sunday through Saturday between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 10:00
a.m.  Those worksites will survey over a 7 day period due to fluctuating
employee schedules so that for purposes of AVR reporting, they
will account for individual employees over their 5 day work week.
 The work week may very well not be the same 5 days for all employees.

<P>
The employer may use an alternative window upon writing the District
and receiving written approval.  The alternative window must be
a consecutive four hour period between 4:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m.,
and a consecutive five day period of the seven day week when the
majority of their employees are scheduled to report to the worksite.

include all employees scheduled to report in the 6:00-10:00 a.m.
window.
<P>
The AVR is calculated by dividing the number of employees who
report to the worksite, by the number of vehicles that arrive
at the worksite, during the 5 day window.  The AVR figure should
be rounded off to the second decimal place.  Example: 1.4576 becomes
1.46 AVR.

<LI>LOW-INCOME EMPLOYEE means an individual whose salary is equal
to, or less than, the current individual income level set in the
California Code of Regulations, Title 25, Section 6932, as lower
income for the county in which the employer is based.  Higher
income employees may be considered to be &quot;low-income&quot;
if the employees demonstrate that the program strategy would create
a substantial economic burden.
<LI>MULTI-SITE EMPLOYER means any person(s), firm, business, educational
institution, non-profit agency or corporation, government agency
or other entity which has more than one worksite within the South
Coast Air Quality Management District where 100 or more employees
report to a worksite.

at the worksite because the employee has remained at the worksite
or is no longer within the District's jurisdiction for one day
or more, during the week of the survey.
<LI>ON-SITE COORDINATOR means a person who meets the requirements
of these guidelines and serves as an on-site contact for employees

than a continuous 90-day period or an agricultural employee who
is employed for up to a continuous 16-week period.
<LI>STRATEGY means an employee commute reduction program element
developed, offered and/or implemented by employers for the purpose
of encouraging employees to use modes of transportation other
than single occupant vehicles when reporting to work during the
employer's window.

center, for a full workday, that eliminates the trip to work or
reduces travel distance by more than 50%. 
<LI>TEMPORARY EMPLOYEE means any person employed by an employment
service or agency, that reports to a worksite other than the employment
agency's worksite, under a contractual arrangement with a temporary
employer.  Temporary employees are only counted as employees of
the temporary agency for purposes of Rule applicability and calculating
AVR.  
<LI>TOTAL SURPLUS VEHICLE REDUCTIONS (TSVR) is the sum of the
surplus daily commute vehicle reductions that exceeds the AVR
target, calculated according to these guidelines, at each site
included in a multi-site or geographic program. 
<LI>TOTAL VEHICLE REDUCTION SHORTFALL (TVRS) is the sum of the
additional daily commute vehicle reductions needed to attain the
AVR target, calculated according to these guidelines, at each
site included in a multi-site or geographic program.
<LI>TRANSPORTATION MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION OR TRANSPORTATION MANAGEMENT
ORGANIZATION (TMA/TMO) means a private/non-profit association
that has a financial dues structure joined together in a legal
agreement for the purpose of achieving mobility and air quality
goals and objectives within a designated area.
<LI>TRAINING PROVIDER means a person(s), firm, business, educational
institution, non-profit agency, corporation, or other entity which
meets the minimum guideline qualifications and is certified by
the AQMD to provide training to ETC's, and On-site Coordinators.

in the vehicle for the majority of the total trip distance.
<LI>VEHICLE TRIP is based on the means of transportation used
for the greatest distance of an employee's home-to-work commute
trip for employees who start work during the peak period.  Each
vehicle trip to the worksite shall be calculated as follows:
</OL>

<P>
In October 1995, the AQMD Governing Board held a public hearing
to receive comments on Rules 1501 - Work Trip Reduction Plans
and 1501.1 - Alternatives to Work Trip Reduction Plans, and to
consider the status of these rules in light of recently approved
state legislation stipulating that the South Coast Air Quality
Management District was prohibited from requiring Trip Reduction
Plans.  At that meeting, staff was directed to write a new rule
to replace both Rules 1501 and 1501.1.
<P>
Staff has developed Proposed Rule 2202 - On-Road Motor Vehicle
Mitigation Options to replace Rules 1501 and 1501.1.  The main
focus of Proposed Rule 2202 is utilization of various emission
reduction strategies to reduce emissions that would be equivalent
to those attained if all employers met their Average Vehicle Ridership
(AVR) targets under Rule 1501  It is necessary to replace the
emission reductions included as part of the State Implementation
Plan (SIP) which result from implementation of Rules 1501, 1501.1
and Proposed Rule 1504.1.  The total emission reductions attributed
to these Rules is 10.3 ton/pay of VOC, 7.4 tons/day of NOx and
81.5 tons/day of CO.
<P>
The federal Clean Air Act requires the AQMD to adopt (1) reasonably
available transportation control measures (&#167;172(c)(1)), 42
U.S.C. &#167;7502(c)(1)); (2) transportation control measures
to offset growth in emissions due to growth in vehicle miles traveled
(VMT) (&#167;182(d)(1)(A), 42 U.S.C. &#167;7511a(d)(1)(A)); and
(3) a revision to the State Implementation Plan (SIP) requiring,
at minimum, employers of 100 or more to submit a compliance plan
to increase average passenger occupancy during peak commute hours
by 25% over the average in the area (&#167;182(d)(1)(B), 42 U.S.
C &#167;7511 a(d)(1)(B).)  That SIP revision must require employers
to implement programs to reduce work-related vehicle trips and
miles traveled by employees.
<P>
Similarly, state law requires air pollution control districts
and air quality management districts to adopt and implement transportation
control measures and an indirect source control program.  (Health
&amp; Safety Code &#167;&#167;40716, 40717, 40918(c) and (d).)
 (Unless otherwise noted, all section references are to the Health
&amp; Safety Code.)  Specifically, the California Clean Air Act
requires the AQMD to adopt and implement transportation control
measures sufficient to: (1) significantly reduce the rate of increase
in vehicle trips and vehicle miles traveled; (2) demonstrate no
net increase in motor vehicle emissions after 1997; and (3) achieve
by 1999 an average during weekday commute hours of 1.5 or more
persons per passenger vehicle.  (&#167;&#167;40918, 40920.)  In
meeting these goals, the AQMD must provide regulated business
the opportunity to develop and demonstrate alternative strategies
to achieve equivalent emission reductions other than trip reduction
programs.  (&#167;40919(f).)  
<H1><B><A NAME="_Toc342271433">II. BACKGROUND</A></B></H1>

<P>
Regulation XV was first adopted by the AQMD Governing Board on
December 11, 1987.  The regulation required employers with 100
or more employees at a work site to develop and implement work
trip reduction plans to meet an average vehicle ridership (AVR)
target specified for the different source receptor areas, ranging
from 1.3 in rural areas to 1.75 in or near downtown Los Angeles.
<P>
Since its inception, Regulation XV has been amended six times
to improve its effectiveness, equity and ease of implementation.
 The development and approval process for trip reduction plans
was streamlined in 1993.  Regulation XV was also restructured
at that time to consolidate the work trip reduction plan requirements
into Rule 1501 - Work Trip Reduction Plans.  Rule 1502 - District
Delegation to Local Governments, was adopted to establish criteria
and procedures to permit the AQMD to delegate implementation of
Rule 1501 to local government (pursuant to H&amp;SC Section 40717(e)
and (f)).
<P>
The AQMD Governing Board established the Rule 1501 Task Force
in January 1994 to investigate methods for further streamlining
the regulation.  The Task Force consisted of representatives from
the private and public sectors of the regulated community, certain
regulatory agencies and environmental organizations.
<P>
In April 1995, the AQMD Governing Board adopted amendments to
Rule 1501 and a new Rule 1501.1 to allow the use of alternative
strategies for compliance with Rule 1501.  EPA granted approval
of 1501.1 implementation which is based on demonstrating emission
reduction equivalency under its Program for Excellence and Leadership
in Government (Project XL).  Project XL provides for the testing
of new approaches to reducing pollution that will be more effective,
or reduce costs compared to the traditional approach they are
replacing (Attachment A).  Both the Rule 1501 amendments and new
Rule 1501.1 began to be implemented on July 1, 1995. 
<P>
In October 1995, the AQMD Governing Board held a public hearing
to receive comments on Rules 1501 and 1501.1, and to consider
the status of these rules in light of recently approved state
legislation stipulating that air quality districts would be prohibited
from requiring Trip Reduction Plans.  At that meeting, staff was
directed to write a new rule to replace both Rules 1501 and 1501.1
which did not contain a mandatory trip reduction component.
<H1><B><A NAME="_Toc342271434">III. REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS</A></B>
</H1>

<P>
The California Legislature created the SCAQMD in 1977 as the agency
responsible for developing and enforcing air pollution control
rules and regulations in the South Coast Air Basin (Basin).  By
statute, the AQMD is required to adopt an air quality management
plan (AQMP) demonstrating compliance with all state and federal
ambient air quality standards for the Basin.  Furthermore, the
AQMD must adopt rules and regulations that carry out the AQMP.
 
<P>
The 1990 amendments to the federal Clean Air Act (CAA) required
the AQMD to develop and implement employer-based trip reduction
programs that: 1) reduce work-related trips and vehicle miles
traveled by employees; 2) apply to employers with 100 or more
employees; and 3) increase the average vehicle occupancy during
peak period commute hours by at least 25%.
<P>
The CAA and the California Health and Safety Code (CH&amp;S) require
the AQMD to implement an indirect source control program as part
of its attainment strategy &#167;40918(d).  The term &quot;indirect
source&quot; refers to a facility, building, structure, installation,
real property, road, or highway which attracts, or may attract,
mobile sources of pollution.  Pursuant to CH&amp;S Section 40717(a)
the AQMD must adopt, implement, and enforce transportation control
measures with the following three performance standards: 1) substantially
reduce future increases in the number of passenger vehicle trips
and miles traveled (CH&amp;S &#167; 40918(c)); 2)  achieve an
average vehicle occupancy (AVO) of 1.5 by 1999 (CH&amp;S &#167;
40920(c)); and 3)  implement transportation control measures (TCMs)
to ensure no net increase in vehicle emissions after 1997 (CH&amp;S
&#167; 40920(c)).  Rule 1501 was the first step in the development
of an indirect source program in the AQMD.  Rule 1501.1 added
flexibility toward meeting regulated employers emissions reduction
objectives.
<P>
Recent State legislation, SB437 (Lewis) and SB772 (Hurtt) directly
impacts employer trip reduction requirements.  Specifically, SB437
prohibits implementation of mandatory trip reduction programs,
such as ridesharing rules unless expressly mandated by federal
law and the elimination of the program would result in federal
sanctions.  SB772 prohibits SCAQMD from requiring trip reduction
plans.  These two bills have been approved by the Assembly and
Senate and signed into law by the Governor.  The laws will become
effective on January 1, 1996.  Proposed Rule 2202 complies with
these laws by eliminating requirements for trip reduction and
replacing Rules 1501 and 1501.1 with a performance based, emission
reduction rule.  Proposed Rule 2202 also combines the best elements
of both 1501 and 1501.1 programs with additional elements to add
greater flexibility, provide more cost-effective reasonably available
options for businesses and demonstrate equivalent emission reductions
to those that would be anticipated if Rule 1501 were fully implemented
and met its targets.
<P>
AQMD has specific authority to adopt indirect source control measures
pursuant to CH&amp;S &#167;40716 and &#167;40918(d), as well as
general authority under CH&amp;S &#167;40001 and &#167; 40702.
 Under this authority, AQMD could require implementation of reasonably
available measures, such as remote sensing and may also offer
alternative options, as provided  under Proposed Rule 2202.
<H1><B>IV. LEGAL AUTHORITY</B></H1>

<P>
<A NAME=""></A>
<P>
The following is a discussion of the legal authority for proposed
Rule 2202 and the effects of SB 437 and SB 772, in response to
issues raised during the rulemaking process.  Staff believes that
adoption of proposed Rule 2202 is not prohibited by SB 437 or
SB 772.  Those bills prohibit the District from requiring an employer
to implement an employee trip reduction program or submit a trip
reduction plan.  The bills do not affect other authority of the
District related to control of emissions from indirect sources.
 SB 437 explicitly states that:
<P>
&quot;Nothing in this section shall preclude a public agency from
regulating indirect sources in any manner that is not specifically
prohibited by this section, where otherwise authorized by law.&quot;
<P>
Several existing statutes authorize the District to implement
indirect source control programs.  (Health &amp; Safety. Code
&#167;&#167;40440(a)(3), 40716, 40918(c), 40920(c).)  The term
&quot;indirect source&quot; is not defined in state law but is
broadly defined in federal law to mean &quot;a facility, building,
structure, installation, real property, road, or highway which
attracts, or may attract, mobile sources of pollution . . . .&quot;
 (42 U.S.C. &#167;7410(a)(5)(C).)  This definition includes the
facilities belonging to employers regulated under Proposed Rule
2202.  While SB 772 does not contain a similar explicit preservation
of indirect source authority, it is explicitly limited in applicability
to requirements for employer trip reduction plans and does not
purport to overturn any other existing authority pursuant to the
statutes cited above.
<P>
Rule 2202 is a valid exercise of the District's indirect source
emission control authority.  We do not believe that the rule &quot;requires&quot;
implementation of a trip reduction program or plan in violation
of SB 437 or SB 772.  While the rule allows implementation of
programs at the discretion of an employer, this is but one of
a number of alternatives from which the employer may choose. 
Under state law, the District however has an adequate legal and
factual basis to adopt Rule 2202 without permitting the option
of implementing rideshare programs.  (However, a number of employers
have requested that this option remain available.)  The alternatives
other than those related to ridesharing are reasonably available
from a technical and economic standpoint such that ridesharing
is a true option rather than a requirement.
<P>
Even if it were concluded that the proposed rule does &quot;require&quot;
rideshare programs or plans, this would not be prohibited under
SB 437 because federal law requires the SIP for this region to
contain a requirement for employers with 100 employees to submit
rideshare plans to achieve a 25% increase in average vehicle occupancy
over the average in the area.  (42 U.S.C. &#167;7511a(d)(1)(B).).
 Under federal law, failure to comply with this requirement mandates
imposition of sanctions.  Imposition of such sanctions after 18
months is not discretionary.  (42 U.S.C. &#167;7509(a).)  SB 437
explicitly allows requirements for trip reduction programs if
they are &quot;explicitly required by federal law and the elimination
of the program will result in the imposition of federal sanctions
. . . .&quot;  Thus, SB 437 does not prohibit Rule 2202.  While
SB 772 does not include such a limitation, even more clearly than
SB 437 it is of limited applicability since it contains only a
prohibition which is limited to requirements to submit trip reduction
plans, something which is not mandated by proposed Rule 2202.
<P>
Some have suggested that SB 437 and SB 772 be interpreted as prohibiting
any rules relating to employers.  However, the two laws do not
state this.  Nor are they ambiguous regarding this issue.  If
a law is clear on its face, it must be interpreted consistently
with the plain meaning of the words.
<P>
Finally, the fact that the emission reductions required by Rule
2202 are determined based upon those achievable through rideshare
programs does not violate SB 437 or SB 772.  The emission reduction
limitations were determined based upon reductions associated with
ridesharing for three reasons which do not affect compliance with
the bills.  First, federal Clean Air Act Section 182(d)(1)(B),
which requires trip reduction plans, has been construed by EPA
to allow compliance through certain alternative emission reduction
strategies as long as they achieve emissions reductions equivalent
to those which the rideshare plans would achieve.  One purpose
of Rule 2202 is to comply with this federal requirement.  Second,
if Rule 1501 is to be rescinded it must be replaced with a rule
at least equally as effective in order to maintain the region's
attainment demonstration.  Third, proposed Rule 2202 would replace
Rule 1501 which is relied upon as part of the District's compliance
with the requirement to attain an average vehicle ridership of
1.5<B> </B>by 1999.  (&#167;40920(c).)
<H1><B>V. SUMMARY OF RULE</B></H1>

<P>
Proposed Rule 2202 provides a menu of reasonably available emission
reduction strategies which are technologically feasible, highly
cost-effective and have a proven record of emission reductions
in the South Coast Air Basin.  The intent is to make compliance
less costly, and easier to implement.  The menu contains a performance
based emission reduction approach and credit is given for voluntary
trip reduction activities.  By providing reasonably available
choices, the AQMD is allowing businesses to make decisions based
on their individual needs and financial situations.  Proposed
Rule 2202 does all of the following:
<UL>
<LI>Replaces Rules 1501 and 1501.1
<LI>Provides performance based emission reduction targets with
an option to continue use of a good faith effort trip reduction
approach
<LI>Contains a menu of reasonably available options with the flexibility
to choose one or several to attain emission reduction targets
<LI>Expands the Air Quality Investment Program (AQIP) to include
employers from one to five hundred employees, with a one or three
year buy in option, and reduces the amount of fees per employee
<LI>Allows the use of Regulation XIII emission reduction credits
generated after January 1, 1996
<LI>Gives credit for traditional ridesharing actions, if this
option is chosen by  the employer
<LI>Provides triennial plan review cycle option for the AQIP and
the Employee Commute Reduction Program
<LI>Simplifies annual analysis
<LI>Gives credit for reduction of VMT
<LI>Specifies a sunset date for the rule 
<LI>Clarifies the role of Regulation VII
<LI>Provides for a transitional period to change over from the
old rules

<H2><B><A NAME="_Toc342271436">Applicability</A></B></H2>

<P>
Proposed Rule 2202 will become effective upon adoption.  Proposed
Rule 2202 applies to any employer who employs 100 or more employees
on a full or part-time basis at a worksite for a consecutive six-month
period calculated as a monthly average.
<H2><B><A NAME="_Toc342271437">Requirements</A></B></H2>

<P>
Employers subject to this rule are required to implement an emission
reduction program to reduce emissions related to employee commutes
and to meet an annual emission reduction target (ERT) for their
site.
<H2><B><A NAME="_Toc342271438">On-Road Vehicle Mitigation Options</A></B>
</H2>

<P>
Companies can meet the emission reduction requirements of Proposed
Rule 2202 by implementing one or more of the strategies contained
in the rule.  All emission reductions are real, quantifiable and
surplus.  Additionally, those employers who wish to maintain components
of their old trip reduction plan may do so under this option and
supplement any shortfall with other actions.  Alternatively, if
an employer wishes to retain their previous trip reduction program,
they may do so under the employee commute reduction program, which
requires a good faith effort and does not require meeting an emissions
reduction standard.  
<P>
The primary options considered in Proposed Rule 2202 include old
vehicle scrapping, clean on-road vehicle credits, clean off-road
mobile equipment credits, remote sensing, other mobile source
emission reduction credits, parking cash-out, emission reduction
credits from stationary sources and the Air Quality Investment
Program.
<H3><U><B><A NAME="_Toc342271439">Old-Vehicle Scrapping</A></B></U>
</H3>

<P>
The concept behind the old-vehicle scrapping program relies on
the proportionate impact of gross polluting vehicles on air quality.
 Emission inventory estimates place responsibility for over half
of the mobile source emissions on earlier model vehicles, which
represent less than one fifth of the overall vehicle population.
 Substantial emission reductions would therefore be gained by
retiring these high polluting older vehicles and replacing them
with cleaner ones.
<P>
AQMD adopted Rule 1610 - Old Vehicle Scrapping on January 8, 1993,
as a Mobile Source Emission Reduction Credit (MSERC) program.
 Under this rule, stationary sources are allowed to purchase and
scrap pre-'82 vehicles, which meet minimum qualifying criteria
for the purpose of obtaining MSERCs.  These MSERCs could then
be used to comply with AQMD stationary source rules, including
RECLAIM.  The MSERCs are issued according to the model year of
the vehicles scrapped, with more credits issued for the earliest
years (pre '72 model year).  The credits last for a period of
five years and are issued for both VOC, NOx and CO emissions.
<P>
Employers can use MSERCs obtained from an Old Vehicle Scrapping
Program that complies with Rule 1610 to meet the Rule 2202 emission
reduction target of their site.  The MSERCs obtained under Rule
1610 that are used to comply with Proposed Rule 2202 would no
longer be available to satisfy stationary source rule requirements.
 This option may be used on an annual basis, or the applicants
may choose a triennial compliance option provided that the emission
reduction target does not change over the three year program due
to a variation  in the employment base.
<P>
Old-vehicle scrapping is a technologically feasible, highly cost-effective
strategy with a proven record of emission reductions in the South
Coast Air Basin.  The flexibility provided through Proposed Rule
2202 will further enhance the emission reduction potential of
the strategy by offering a wider range of uses for the emission
reductions generated. Since its inception in 1993, pursuant to
Rule 1610 - Old Vehicle Scrapping, 5,999 old vehicles have been
scrapped, resulting in reductions of  941 tons of VOC, 720 tons
of NOx and 4,728 tons of CO emissions.
<H3><U><B><A NAME="_Toc342271440">Clean On-Road Vehicle Credits</A></B></U>
</H3>

<P>
The concept behind clean on-road credits is to reduce NOx, VOC,
CO, PM-10 and SOx emissions from on-road vehicles by issuing mobile
source emission reduction credits (MSERCs) to vehicle operators
that voluntarily purchase new low- or zero-emission vehicles,
or repower or retrofit their existing vehicles to achieve low-
or  zero-emission standards.  Rule 1612 - Clean On-Road Mobile
Equipment, which was adopted on September 8, 1995, applies to
on-road mobile sources, including passenger cars, light-duty trucks,
medium-duty vehicles, and heavy-duty vehicles.  The rule establishes
a mechanism to issue MSERCs based on a baseline emission level
for the specific type and model-year of vehicle, an optional emission
level of the low- or zero-emission vehicle, and the annual vehicle
miles traveled (VMT).  Any facility which implements a clean on-road
vehicle program in compliance with Rule 1612 can use the MSERCs
generated to comply with Proposed Rule 2202.
<H3><U><B><A NAME="_Toc342271441">Clean Off-Road Mobile Equipment</A></B></U>
</H3>

<P>
Rule 1620 - Clean Off-Road Mobile Equipment, which was adopted
September 8, 1995, allows for the generation of MSERCs for the
voluntary purchase of new low- or zero-emission equipment; or
the repowering, retrofitting, or permanent replacement of existing
equipment to meet low-emission targets.  Rule 1620 sets requirements
for equipment operators to qualify for MSERCs and establishes
a mechanism for determining how they are used and the quantity
of MSERCs issued.
<P>
For purposes of credit generation, the program applies to off-road
mobile equipment and vehicle categories for which emission standards
have been adopted by the ARB or U.S. EPA, and optional emission
standards have been specified by the ARB.  Currently, the only
equipment subject to the rules are off-road diesel cycle equipment
greater than 50 horsepower and specialty vehicles (e.g., utility
service vehicles).  Other equipment categories will be subject
to the rule once mandatory standards are adopted and optional
emission standards have been specified by the ARB or U.S. EPA.
 Any facility which implements a clean off-road mobile equipment
program in compliance with Rule 1620 can use the MSERCs generated
to comply with Proposed Rule 2202.
<H3><U><B><A NAME="_Toc342271442">Remote Sensing</A></B></U></H3>

<P>
Remote sensing devices are emission monitoring devices that are
used in the field, in conjunction with an emission limitation
standard.  Remote sensing can be used to enhance the effectiveness
of existing tailpipe standards, and can also be used to identify
&quot;gross polluters.&quot;  The emissions reduction potential
of this strategy results from the subsequent vehicle maintenance
performed on the identified high-emitting vehicles.  Remote sensing
improves efficiency of inspection and maintenance programs because
it focuses on cleaning up the worst polluting vehicles even before
state-mandated inspection and maintenance is due.  Credits for
any improved inspection and maintenance program would have to
go beyond the requirements of existing state and federal programs
to avoid &quot;double-counting&quot; the emission reductions.
<H3><U><B><A NAME="_Toc342271443">Emission Reduction Credits from
Stationary Sources</A></B></U></H3>

<P>
 Companies can meet some or all of the emission reduction requirements
of Proposed Rule 2202 by using Emission Reduction Credits (ERCs)
generated from stationary sources after January 1, 1996, in accordance
with Regulation XIII - New Source Review (NSR). Regulation XIII
provides for the generation of ERCs for emission decreases as
a result of equipment being overcontrolled, shut down or process
modifications.  ERCs are granted based on the demonstration that
the emission reductions are real, quantifiable, permanent, enforceable,
and not greater than if the equipment being overcontrolled or
shut down were operating with the BACT.  The ERCs are calculated
in pounds of pollutant per year and are directly applicable toward
meeting the overall emission reduction target (ERT) from Proposed
Rule 2202.
<H3><U><B><A NAME="_Toc342271444">Air Quality Investment Program</A></B></U>
</H3>

<P>
Employers choosing this option are not responsible for achieving
their ERT; they need only notify the AQMD, maintain information
concerning the number of affected employees, and submit the air
quality investment fee.  The AQMD is then responsible for achieving
their equivalent emission reductions.
<P>
The concept of an air quality investment program is based on relative
cost effectiveness  This program has been updated to provide a
one year and three year option.  Employers may choose to invest
in the AQIP for one year at a cost of $60 per employee who reports
to work during the peak window, or they may choose to participate
for three years at a cost of $125 per employee who reports to
work during the peak window.  In each case, the employers will
be required to file an annual registration form with the AQMD.
 Additionally, the AQIP has been expanded to allow participation
by employers ranging in size from 100 to 500 employees.  Ernst
&amp; Young conducted a study for the AQMD (August 1992) to determine,
among other items, the average cost of compliance with Rule 1501.
 The study estimated the average cost to be about $110 per regulated
employee (adjusted to 1995 dollars).  Therefore, depending on
 the size and number of years an employer chooses to participate,
a significant amount of money may be saved.  
<P>
The AQMD will accept proposals for using monies for the Air Quality
Investment Program on an ongoing basis.  The amount of emission
reductions required to demonstrate equivalency and the amount
achievable under each proposal will also be evaluated.  The Executive
Officer will then recommend to the AQMD Governing Board, on a
quarterly basis, the most cost-effective proposals that achieve
equivalent emission reductions.  The Executive Officer will also
provide a status report to the Governing Board on program effectiveness
and the fund's balance.
<H2><B><A NAME=""><B> Vehicle Trip Emission Credits</B></A></B>
</H2>

<P>
The following trip reduction strategies may be implemented  for
vehicle trip emission credits by those employers who choose these
options.
<H3><U><B><A NAME="_Toc342271446">Peak Commute Trip Reductions</A></B></U>
</H3>

<P>
Peak commute trip reductions are reductions that occur as a result
of strategies for reducing vehicle trips during the morning peak
commuting hours (6-10 am, Monday - Friday).
<H3><U><B><A NAME="_Toc342271447">Other Work-Related Trips</A></B></U>
</H3>

<P>
 Employers may choose to implement trip reduction strategies or
emission reduction strategies for trips occurring outside the
peak commute window.  Credit will be given under this option for
any other type of trip reduction or emission reduction strategy
which does not occur as a peak commute trip.  Any proposed program
should contain an emissions or trip quantification methodology
which follows the general format outlined in the On-Road Motor
Vehicle Mitigation Options Guidelines.  AQMD will approve programs
that produce emission or trip reductions that are real, surplus,
quantifiable and enforceable.
<H3><U><B><A NAME="_Toc342271448">Alternative Fuel Vehicles</A></B></U>
</H3>

<P>
Employers may receive credit for the use of alternative fueled
vehicles as well as the conversion of gasoline powered vehicles
to alternative fueled vehicle configurations, used for commute
purposes as well as for other business trips, towards meeting
their emission reduction targets (ERTs).  Specifically, employers
may receive vehicle trip emission credits (VTECs) from employer
owned, leased, or operated, original equipment manufacturer (OEM)
or from vehicles converted to compressed natural gas-, methanol-,
propane-, or electric fuel that have been certified and/or approved
by the CARB to have met the transitional low emission vehicle
&quot;TLEV&quot;, low emission vehicle &quot;LEV&quot;, ultra
low emission vehicle &quot;ULEV&quot; or zero emission vehicle
&quot;ZEV&quot; emission standards.
<H3><U><B><A NAME="_Toc342271449">Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT)
Reduction Programs</A></B></U></H3>

<P>
 Employers may elect to implement VMT reduction programs and receive
VTECs toward their ERT.  Reduction of annual employee commute
VMT that may result from employment center relocation, video conference
center, telecommuting centers or other alternative programs approved
by the Executive Officer or his designee are encouraged under
this option.
<H3><U><B><A NAME="_Toc342271450">Parking Cash-Out Programs</A></B></U>
</H3>

<P>
Employers may reduce commute trips by electing to implement a
parking cash-out program and may obtain VTECs that can be applied
toward their ERT.  Under the parking cash-out program, employers
offer to provide a cash allowance to an employee in lieu of their
parking space.  The cash allowance provided is equivalent to the
parking subsidy that the employer would otherwise pay to provide
the employee with a parking space. Several studies have indicated
that parking cash-out programs can be very effective in achieving
worktrip and VMT reductions, and improving air quality.
<H2><B><A NAME="_Toc342271451">Other Rule Provisions</A></B></H2>

<H3><U><B><A NAME="_Toc342271452">Administration</A></B></U></H3>

<P>
Compliance with Proposed Rule 2202 will require an employer to
identify a chosen option or options and provide appropriate information
to determine their ERT.  Calculations must be submitted on an
annual basis for all options.  Employers choosing to implement
the old vehicle scrapping option or the employer commute reduction
program may choose to submit an application and calculation the
first year and a registration form for the remaining two years.
 These two programs, along with the AQIP,  are the only options
that have a triennial compliance schedule.
<H3><U><B><A NAME="_Toc342271453">Compliance</A></B></U></H3>

<P>
AQMD staff will determine compliance under Proposed Rule 2202,
through an employer review process.  All calculations and sufficient
support documentation will be audited to ensure that all emission
reduction credits are real and correct.  For an employer to achieve
compliance with the performance based On-Road Vehicle Mitigation
Options they must attain the ERT, or in the case of the AQIP they
must submit the annual fee for each employee reporting to work
in the peak window, or the triennial fee.  An employer's ERT can
be achieved by generating Mobile Source Emission Reduction Credits
or Emission Reduction Credits through the use of one or more of
the following programs:
<UL>
<LI>Old Vehicle Scrapping;
<LI>Clean On-Road Vehicle Credits;
<LI>Clean Off-Road Mobile Equipment Credits;
<LI>Remote Sensing
<LI>Other Mobile Source Emission Reduction Credits
<LI>Emission Reduction Credits from Stationary Sources; and
<LI>Air Quality Investment Program.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
Additionally, attainment of the emission reduction target can
be accomplished, in part or in whole, by implementing one or more
of the vehicle trip reduction strategies.  VTECs will be applied
directly towards the emission reduction target and are earned
by implementing strategies such as;
<UL>
<LI>Peak Commute Trip Reductions;
<LI>Other Work-Related Trip Reductions;
<LI>Alternative Fuel Vehicles; and
<LI>Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) Reduction Programs
</UL>

<P>

<P>
Rather than comply with the performance based On-Road Vehicle
Mitigation Options strategies listed above, an employer may elect
to implement an Employee Commute Reduction Program.  This exemption
to Rule 2202 is a good faith effort strategy and non-attainment
of the target AVR is not a violation of the rule.
<H3><U><B><A NAME="_Toc342271454">Exemptions</A></B></U></H3>

<P>
The rule provides for three situations where a business may be
exempted.  Employers may be exempted when the employee population
falls below 100 employees for a period of six months or fewer
than 33 employees report to work during the peak commute window
for a period of 90 days.  Additionally, employers who have declared
bankruptcy may be granted a temporary waiver from complying with
the requirements of the rule.  A third option is the use of the
employee commute reduction program.  This is a good faith effort
program, in that not attaining the target AVR will not be deemed
a violation.
<H3><U><B><A NAME="_Toc342271455">Employee Commute Reduction Programs</A></B></U>
</H3>

<P>
As an alternative to implementing on-road vehicle mitigation options
employers may elect to exempt themselves from the requirements
of Proposed Rule 2202, and instead implement an Employee Commute
Reduction Program that demonstrates conformance with the Employee
Commute Reduction Program Guidelines (Paragraph (k)(3) exemptions.)
 Employers must provide a program that will be reasonably likely
to result in the achievement of their worksite AVR goal within
three years by reducing work related vehicle trips and vehicle
miles traveled.
<H3><U><B><A NAME="_Toc342271456">Transitional Period</A></B></U>
</H3>

<P>
To allow for a smooth changeover from Rule 1501 and 1501.1 programs
the rule provides for a transitional period.  All regulated facilities
that have plans due since October 13, 1995, have until February
16, 1996 to submit their plan registrations.  Additionally, all
regulated facilities that have plans due between October 13, 1995
and February 16, 1996 will be permitted to use existing commuter
surveys which would have normally expired between October 13,
1995 and February 16, 1996.  Any Biennial Plan approved after
December 8, 1995 will be considered a Triennial Plan.  Employers
meeting their AVR targets may continue submitting annual analyses
instead of triennial plans.
<H1><B><A NAME="_Toc342271457">V<B>I. SOCIOECONOMIC ASSESSMENT
AND COST- EFFECTIVENESS</B></A></B></H1>

<P>
Proposed Rule 2202 will replace Rules 1501 and 1501.1.  The proposed
rule is intended to achieve the same emission reductions as Rules
1501 and 1501.1, and would provide employers with reasonably available
choices to reach their ERT.  Thus, Proposed Rule 2202 would not
significantly alter air quality or emission limitations from the
existing situation.  The AQMD has performed a qualitative assessment
of potential socioeconomic impacts to identify any potential significant
adverse economic impact.
<P>
The proposed rule provides a menu of alternative emission reduction
strategies, including old vehicle scrapping credits, clean on-road
vehicle credits, clean off-road mobile equipment credits, remote
sensing, other mobile source emission reduction credits, emission
reduction credits from stationary sources, and the Air Quality
Investment Program.  Under the provisions of the proposed rule,
worksites with more than 100 employees can choose the most cost-effective
strategies to meet their emission reduction targets, according
to their individual needs.  The affected facilities belong to
nearly every sector of the economy.  No one alternative must be
implemented; therefore, worksites will select the alternatives
most favorable and presumably cost-effective for them.  In cases
where the alternatives are less costly to implement than what
the facility currently spends on Rule 1501, worksites will accrue
savings. The proposed amendments are, therefore, likely to reduce
the economic impacts compared to Rule 1501.  In addition, under
the proposed rule, affected facilities are given the flexibility
to implement, or continue with, an employee commute reduction
program if they so choose though it will no longer be required.
<P>
Proposed Rule 2202 is significantly more cost-effective than the
existing Rule 1501.  It provides employers with a menu of reasonably
available emission reduction strategy options that are less costly
compared to the trip reduction strategies and more effective in
reducing emissions.  Table I provides an overview of the cost-effectiveness
associated with the various options proposed under Proposed Rule
2202.  The cost information has been adjusted to 1995 prices.
<P>
Based on the cost analysis prepared for the April 1995 staff report
for Rule 1501, the cost-effectiveness of work trip reduction plans
estimates a $110 per employee annual implementation cost.  This
cost is estimated to range from $18,231 to $35,638 a ton.  The
lower end of the range is based on attainment of an AVR target
of 1.5, while the higher end of the range is based on a current
AVR of 1.28.  Total costs are assumed to remain constant regardless
of AVR attained.
<P>
Cost effectiveness for the Air Quality Investment Fund is based
on $60 per employee for a one year period and $125 per employee
for a three year period.  When converted to cost per ton, these
numbers translate into a cost-effectiveness that ranges from $9,655
to $6,705 per ton.
<P>
The estimated cost of scrapping old vehicles varies from $3,024
to $6,696 per ton, or $756 to $864 per old vehicle.  These estimates
are based on the 1992 Final Staff Report for Proposed Rule 1610
(Old Vehicle Scrapping) and ARB's 1993 Mobile Source Emission
Reduction Credits Guidelines.
<P>
The preliminary cost-effectiveness of the remote sensing option
is established at $1,800 per ton and is based on an average repair
cost of $630 per vehicle.  Repair cost per vehicle ranges from
a minimum of $42 per car for minor repairs, to $2,200 per car
for engine replacement.  These preliminary estimates of repair
costs were developed by the AQMD's Office of Technology Advancement
and they are based on a remote sensing study of  thousands of
vehicles, of which 103 were identified as gross polluters and
were subsequently repaired.  The cost-effectiveness excludes the
cost of the remote sensing equipment.  It is estimated that the
cost of leasing a van containing all the necessary remote sensing
equipment and an operator to do the testing could cost between
$10,000 and $12,000 for a one-week testing period.  In addition,
it is important to note that the initial leasing cost figures
that include start-up costs and R&amp;D efforts are expected to
significantly lower in the future as demand for the technology
increases and economy of scale is achieved.  Leasing costs are
lower if the equipment is used by several employers.
<P>
The cost effectiveness of replacing a diesel bus with a bus powered
by compressed natural gas (CNG) ranges from a low of $1,300 to
a high of $16,000 per ton of NOx reduced, depending on which cost
assumptions and scenarios provided in ARB's 1994 MSERCs Guidance
Document are used.  Implementation costs, for example, would be
a function of the vehicle capital cost, fuel cost, maintenance
cost, fuel economy and refueling infrastructure costs.
<P>
Cost-effectiveness information prepared for the 1995 Final Staff
Report for Proposed Rule 1620 (Credits for Clean Off-Road Mobile
Equipment) was used in Table I.  Depending on which technology
is used, the cost could vary from $2,200 to $3,200 per ton of
NOx reduced to a greater savings for combined ton of NOx and VOC
reduced.

<P>
The 1994 AQMP ranks all proposed control measures by cost-effectiveness.
 Proposed Rule 2202 is not part of any control measure identified
in the 1994 AQMP and is, therefore, not within the identified
ranking.  The 1994 AQMP listing of control measures and their
cost-effectiveness is incorporated herein by reference as though
set forth in full.  The Proposed Rule is intended to achieve similar
emission reductions as required by Rules 1501, 1501.1 and 1504.1.
 The necessity of these amendments is discussed in the Sections
I-IV of this Staff Report.
<H2><U><B><A NAME="_Toc342271459">Rule Adoption Relative to the
Cost-Effectiveness Schedule</A> </B></U></H2>

<P>
On October 14, 1994, the Governing Board adopted a resolution
that requires staff to address whether proposed rules being considered
for adoption are being presented in rank order by cost-effectiveness
as defined in the 1994 AQMP.  The proposed amendments are not
covered by the 1994 AQMP.  Instead, these amendments are intended
to provide additional flexibility and reduce compliance costs
of AQMD regulations, and to implement state and federal law. 
Since Proposed Rule 2202 allows a menu of alternative emission
reduction strategies, the ranking of its cost-effectiveness may
vary depending upon the alternative strategies implemented.  It
is anticipated that worksites will elect to implement only those
alternatives that are favorable to them.
<P>
In summary, Proposed Rule 2202 is likely to lower the compliance
cost for affected firms because employers can choose from a menu
of alternative emission reduction strategies that are more cost-effective
than Rule 1501.

Options. A consultation session was held in each county.  Additionally,
two consultation sessions were held at the AQMD Headquarters building.
 Staff has provided a summary of comments received and provided
written responses below.
<H2><B><A NAME="_Toc342271462">Issues</A></B></H2>

<P>
1). Does the AQMD have the authority to adopt Proposed Rule 2202,
given the recent adoption of SB 437 and SB 772?
<P>
<I>Yes, see Attachment D..</I>
<P>
2) Are ride share plans still required?
<P>
<I>No, Rule 2202 does not require the submittal and implementation
of rideshare plans.  Rule 2202 has been designed to comply with
recently enacted state legislation that prohibits requiring mandatory
submittal of ride share plans and to comply with the requirements
of the federal Clean Air Act, as well.  The federal Clean Air
Act requires the implementation of all feasible measures, including
employer based programs, as part of the region's attainment demonstration.
 Proposed Rule 2202 is an emission based rule as opposed to a
trip reduction rule.  Employers have the opportunity to select
from a menu of reasonably available options to meet their emission
reduction target.  Several employers, however, have asked that
the rideshare option be retained.  Therefore, the rule provides
employers with an exemption from meeting the Emission Reduction
Target requirements of the rule, if they elect at their own discretion
to implement an employee commute reduction program.</I>
<P>
3). Does an Employer have to participate in the rule?
<P>
<I>An employer that meets the applicability criteria of Rule 2202
will have to comply with the requirements of the rule.  Rule 2202
applies to the same universe of sources that were subject to Rule
1501 and Rule 1501.1</I>
<P>
4). If the new rule goes into effect January 1, 1996, will I have
to submit a new plan on January 1?
<P>
<I>To establish smooth transition from Rules 1501 and 1501.1 to
Rule 2202, the rule allows employers to continue implementing
the currently approved Rule 1501 trip reduction plans and Rule
1501.1, annual registrations until the respective biennial or
annual expiration dates of these programs.  Employers, additionally,
have the choice of switching over to a Proposed Rule 2202 option
at any time.  Employers must, however, retain their current Rule
1501 or 1501.1 plan in effect until such time as they receive
approval of their Proposed Rule 2202 registration form.</I>
<P>
5). By establishing the costs for the AQIP, the AQMD is picking
winners and losers instead of allowing the market to bear the
costs.
<P>
<I>The AQIP fees in Proposed Rule 2202 have been lowered to reflect
the actual cost of compliance determined by the market conditions
during the first quarter of Rule 1501.1 implementation.  However,
this issue is still open for discussion and the AQMD is using
the numbers contained in Proposed Rule 2202 as a reference point.</I>
<P>
6.) Why limit the AQIP to employers of up to 500?
<P>
<I>The AQIP is a compliance option designed to provide relief
for smaller employers where the marginal cost of compliance may
be higher.  It was included in Rule 1501.1 as a pilot program
for employers with 100 to 200 employees.  After a successful implementation
of the pilot program during the first quarter of Rule 1501 implementation,
staff is proposing to expand the applicability of this option
to employers with up to 500 employees per site.  It is important
to note that Proposed Rule 2202 also attempts to create the necessary
market conditions that will foster the development of innovative
and cost-effective compliance strategies.  Larger employers with
expertise and economies of scale will play an instrumental role
in identifying and implementing these cost-effective strategies.</I>
<P>
7). Does the AQMD intend to allow credit for Alternative Fuel
Vehicles, no matter what the use is, or if used at all?
<P>
<I>Rule 2202 allows employers to receive credit for the use of
alternative fuel vehicles for commute as well as business purposes.
 Credit may be taken by the employer at the time the registration
forms are submitted.  However, on-site documentation will be required
to demonstrate the use of the vehicle and the use of alternative
fuels.</I>
<P>
8). What happens to companies who use triennial employee commute
reduction programs and the rule expires?  Are the employers going
to get refunds?
<P>
<I>Companies that elect to implement triennial employee commute
reduction programs are obligated to continue the implementation
of these programs until the expiration of the rule.  Continued
implementation of these programs after the rule sunsets is, however,
discretionary.  Evaluation fees are assessed based on the actual
time spent by AQMD staff to review and evaluate the program prior
to implementation and, therefore, cannot be refunded when the
rule sunsets. </I>
<P>
9). Can Parking Cash-out be used as an option under Proposed Rule
2202?
<P>
<I>Yes, parking cash-out is now included as part of the menu of
options available for compliance with Rule 2202.</I>
<P>
10). How are the ERCs generated under Regulation XIII used?
<P>
<I>Regulation XIII allows stationary sources that reduce emissions
of VOC, NOx, CO or other pollutants through the installation of
pollution control equipment (that are not required by law), process,
modification and shutdowns to receive ERCs.  A stationary source
subject to Rule 2202 can either use those credits towards meeting
the facility's Rule 2202 emission reduction target, or may sell
those credits to other facilities for compliance with Rule 2202.</I>
<P>
11) Can credit generated under an AB 2766 program be used for
Proposed Rule 2202?
<P>
<I>Proposed Rule 2202 contains no provisions preventing the use
of credits generated under AB 2766 funded programs.  Program restrictions,
however, may be used in place in the contractual agreements distributing
the AB 2766 funds.  All users of these funds should carefully
check to see if there is any prohibition on the use of credits
generated using these funds.</I>
<P>
12). If we exceed our AVR target, can we bank or trade the credits
for use in a later year?
<P>
<I>At this time credits generated from trip reduction measures
are not bankable or tradable.  However, the AQMD staff is looking
into future rule changes that may allow for this possibility.</I>
<P>
13). Are schools exempt from all fees under Proposed Rule 2202?
<P>
<I>AB 355 (Aguiar), California Health and Safety Code Section
44241 exempts school districts from filing fees for Trip Reduction
Plans.  Accordingly, schools opting for the Rule 2202 Employee
Commute Reduction Program exemption are not subject to Rule 308
filing fees.  However, schools complying with Rule 2202 Emission
Reduction Options are subject to Rule 306 filing fees.</I>
<P>
14). If the rule sunsets prior to December 1998, what will happen
to my banked credits?
<P>
<I>If the rule is replaced prior to or by December 1998, any unused
MSERCs will be refunded back to the providers of the credits.
 Refunded MSERCs may then be sold, banked, traded or used by the
holder to comply with other AQMD rules..</I>
<P>
15). The rule does not make provisions for multi-site employers.
 Staff needs to clarify how multi-site employers will be handled.
<P>
<I>New language has been added to Proposed Rule 2202 Paragraph
(h)(4) - Program Administration, that allows multi-site employers
to submit one registration form and pay one registration fee plus
a time and material fee for evaluation of the submittal.</I>
<P>
16). Will the AQMD conduct on-site audits for Rule 2202?
<P>
<I>Yes, the AQMD will continue to conduct audits to ensure compliance.
 These audits may be random, employer requested or complaint generated.</I>
<P>
17). Will the AQMD allow a grace period for rule compliance so
that employers with plan due dates in early January will have
adequate time to comply with the new options?
<P>
<I>Yes, the AQMD will do everything administratively possible
to establish a smooth transition period from Rules 1501 and 1501.1
to Rule 2202.  (Please also refer to response to Comment #4).</I>
<P>
18). How will the AQMD accommodate plans that were due during
the temporary extension period granted by the Governing Board
(Oct. 13 - Dec. 13, 1995) if the surveys exceed the AQMD requirement
of conducting a survey within six months of the submittal date?
<P>
<I>Any survey whose six month timeline expired between Oct. 13
- Dec. 13, 1995 will be accepted by the District up to February
16, 1996.</I>
<P>
19). What will happen to the Indirect Source Rules as a result
of Rule 2202?
<P>
<I>After the December 8, 1995 hearing, staff will evaluate potential
effects, if any.</I>
<P>
20). Will the AQMD continue to use the check-box paper plans?
 Will Plan on a Disk be available for Rule 2202 compliance?
<P>
<I>Yes, both check-box paper forms and electronic forms of program
submittal  will be available to employers electing to implement
an Employee Commute Reduction Program as an exemption to Rule
2202.</I>
<P>
21). Will Rule 2202 have any impact on the City of Irvine and
City of Santa Monica ordinances?
<P>
<I>Employers that are currently in compliance with the trip reduction
ordinances of the City of Santa Monica or the City of Irvine will
be considered in compliance with Rule 2202.  The City of Irvine
and City of Santa Monica have currently an AQMD approved trip
reduction ordinance, and both cities will have to enter with the
AQMD into a new memoranda of understanding if they wish to implement
Rule 2202 in their own jurisdiction.</I>
<P>
22). Do employers choosing the AQIP have to survey their employees
in order to determine the employee count?
<P>
<I>No, surveys are not necessary to determine employee count.
 An employer may rely on personnel records to determine the employee
count.</I>
<P>
23). If an employer has met the AVR target under Rule 1501 and
chooses to continue with the Employee Commute Reduction Program
exemption, can they remove financial incentives from the program?
<P>
<I>If an employer proposes to remove financial incentives from
their Employer Commute Reduction Program, other comparable (i.e.,
equally effective) incentives should be substituted for those
being proposed for removal.  The expectation for any amended program
is that it will continue to make reasonable progress toward achieving
the AVR target with any new or revised incentives.</I>
<P>
24). Will employers be fined for not meeting the AVR Target under
Rule 2202?
<P>
<I>The AVR Targets is only applicable to those employers choosing
to use an Employee Commute Reduction Program exemption.  The Employee
Commute Reduction Program is still a good faith effort program,
and employers who do not meet the AVR target will not be in violation
of the rule, and will not be fined.</I>
<P>
25). Will the adoption of Rule 2202 have any impact on the City
of Los Angeles Transit Subsidy Ordinance?
<P>
<I>No, Rule 2202 will not impact the City of Los Angeles Transit
Subsidy Ordinance.</I>
<P>
26). Do Rule 2202 employers need to have a trained ETC?
<P>
<I>No, an employer under Rule 2202 does not need to maintain a
trained ETC. However, a trained ETC is required if the employer
chooses to exempt the company from Rule 2202 and implement an
Employee Commute Reduction Program .</I>
<P>
27). Do employers choosing to file under the Employee Commute
Reduction Program need to submit an exemption form?
<P>
<I>Employers electing to submit an Employer Commute Reduction
Program will not be required to file a special exemption form
with the AQMD in order to participate under this alternative.
 Employers simply need to file the appropriate paperwork for the
Employer Commute Reduction Program with the AQMD on or before
their annual plan due date.</I>
<P>
28). Will any changes to Regulation VII be reflected in Rule 2202?
<P>
<I>Yes, all changes in Regulation VII will be reflected in Rule
2202, Emergency Episode Procedures.  Please see Rule provision
(h)(9).</I>
<P>
29). Do employers have to use employees' automobiles for the car
scrapping, remote sensing and other options?
<P>
<I>No, Rule 2202 is an emission reduction rule.  It doesn't matter
where the emission reductions come from as long as they are from
within the AQMD, (e.g. staff vehicles or those of the general
public), but the amount of emission reductions obtained is what
matters.  An employer may use any available source permitted under
AQMD rules.</I>
<P>
30). What happens to my plan if I submit a Triennial Plan after
1996, and Rule 2202 sunsets during the life of that plan?
<P>
<I>Once Rule 2202 sunsets, an employer may elect to stop the implementation
of its triennial plan or to continue implementation on a voluntary
basis.</I>
<P>
31). Does the Rule allow for the transfer of credit between facilities
of a multi-site employer from sites that exceed AVR to those that
do not meet their goal?
<P>
<I>Multi-site employers are permitted to share excess VTECs under
Rule 2202, and excess trip reductions under the Employee Commute
Trip Reduction exemption.</I>
<P>
32). Shouldn't the definition of &quot;alternative fuel vehicle&quot;
be broadened to include ethanol, hydrogen, hybrid electric and
bi-fuel vehicles if alternative fuel usage can be documented?
<P>
<I>Although the current alternative fuel definition does not specifically
address hydrogen vehicles, for the purposes of this rule, they
will be considered as zero emission vehicles.  AQMD staff is currently
working with the ARB staff to develop a more comprehensive definition
and methodology of offering alternative fuel vehicle credits.</I>
<P>
33) Do the credits resulting from use of Clean On-Road Vehicles
(Rule 1612), Clean Off-Road Mobile Equipment (Rule 1620), other
mobile source emission reduction credits (Regulation XVI) and
ERCs from stationary sources (Regulation XIII) have the same &quot;life&quot;
as described on page 11 of the On-Road Motor Vehicle Mitigation
Options Implementation Guidelines, for the credits generated from
the Old-Vehicle Scrapping option?
<P>
<I>No, each selected option has a different &quot;life&quot; dependent
upon the rule it is generated under.</I>
<P>
34). Could employers who participate in the triennial option be
able to get credit for the excess emission credits earned if their
number of employees goes down?  How are increases in the number
of employees handled for employers using the triennial option?
<P>
<I>A triennial program would be submitted under the Employee Commute
Reduction Program, which is the good faith effort program.  An
employer is not penalized if they do not make their AVR goal under
this program, conversely, they will not be given additional credits
under this effort either.  No change is required of the employer
as a result in fluctuation of employee population.</I>
<P>
35) The formula for calculating the vehicle trip emission credits
for alternative fuel vehicles doesn't seem to reflect the different
emission levels associated with TLEV, LEV and ULEV.
<P>
<I>The formula for calculating credits for alternative fuel vehicles
included in Rule 2202 is based on the formula included in Rules
1501 and 1501.1 that employers are accustomed to.  However, AQMD
staff is currently working with the ARB staff to develop a more
comprehensive methodology of offering credits for the use of alternative
fuel vehicles.</I>
<P>
36). Does the exemption in Section (k)(1) refer only to employers
which implement an Employee Commute Reduction Program?
<P>
<I>This section has been rewritten to clarify that any employer
implementing Rule 2202 will be exempted from the rule if their
employee population falls below 100 or less than 33 employees
report to the site during the peak window.</I>
<P>
37). Under what circumstances would an employer supplement its
Employee Commute Reduction Program with On-Road Vehicle Mitigation
Options or Vehicle Trip Emission Credits?
<P>
<I>An employer may choose to supplement their Employee Commute
Reduction Program, if for instance, the employer is close to their
target AVR and wishes to show that they have reached their goal
or for experimental purposes.  Supplementing the Employee Commute
Reduction Program is not a requirement, but a choice made by the
employer for their own reasons.</I>
<P>
38). What criteria is used to determine whether a &quot;good faith
effort&quot; has been made?
<P>
<I>The strength of incentive strategies offered in employee commute
reduction programs must correspond to the gap between the current
AVR and the employer's target AVR.  The strength of the incentives
is determined based on past experience in implementing employee
trip reduction programs.</I>
<P>
39). Why aren't the AQIP fees varied by zone?
<P>
<I>The AQIP fees were initially based on the basin-wide average
compliance costs with Rule 1501.  Although employees in rural
areas, for example, had to meet lower ridership targets compared
to employers in more densely populated areas, they had to implement
programs, that would provide more incentives to overcome the lack
of alternative modes of transportation.  Therefore, compliance
costs did not significantly vary by zone.  Under Rule 2202 the
AQIP fees were significantly reduced to reflect the basin-wide
average cost of compliance as was established by the first quarter
of Rule 1501.1 implementation.  It is conceivable that some employers
in different zones may find the average cost of compliance to
be lower than the AQIP fees.  These employers are encouraged to
implement these more cost effective methods as their compliance
strategy.</I>
<P>
40). Why doesn't the Rule allow multi-site companies with some
sites greater than 500 employees to participate in the AQIP?
<P>
<I>Please refer to the response to Comment #5.</I>
<P>
41). Why aren't RECLAIM trading credits included as part of Rule
2202?
<P>
<I>This issue is being examined as part of the Intercredit Trading
Study.  Staff believes that combination of all the trading programs
should be done in a comprehensive fashion which is the goal of
the Intercredit Trading Study.  The Study will be brought before
the Governing Board in February of 1996.</I>
<P>
42). If you participate in an Employee Commute Reduction Program,
do you have to implement Rule 2202?
<P>
<I>No, if you choose the exemption and participate in the Employee
Commute Reduction Program exemption, you are not required to implement
any of the strategies contained in Rule 2202.</I>
<P>
43). Can employers that exceed their AVR target trade or bank
their surplus?
<P>
<I>Internal trading of surplus AVR or trip reductions is allowed
between sites of a multi-site employer.  However, trading of surplus
AVR or trip reductions between different employers or banking
of those reductions is not an option at this time.  Staff is looking
into this issue as a potential future amendment item.</I>
<P>
44). Are all the credits tradable?
<P>
<I>No, ERCs and MSERCs are tradable, however VTECs are not.  VTECs
are generated based on trip reduction strategies which may or
may not continue effectiveness due to the changing situations
at the facilities which generated them.  Staff is looking into
this issue as a potential future amendment item.</I>
<P>
45). How do we transition from Rules 1501 and 1501.1 to Rule 2202?
<P>
<I>Employers that have met their AVR goals may continue to submit
their annual analyses.  Any registrations due between October
13, 1995 and February 16, 1996 have until February 16, 1996 to
submit those forms to the AQMD.  AVR surveys that expired between
October 13, 1995 and February 16, 1996 may be used during this
transition period.  Rule 1501.1 registrations will remain in effect
until the renewal date.</I>
<P>
46). What is the rationale for maintaining a 75% survey response
rate for the Employee Commute Reduction Program?
<P>
The 75% response rate is meant to ensure that the ETC has adequate
information to calculate an AVR that accurately represents the
worksite.  However, based on comments received, staff is proposing
to change the minimum 75% response rate to 60%.
<P>
47). Will the current Rule 1501 biennial plans be converted to
triennial plans?
<P>
<I>No, current biennial plans that have already been approved,
were prepared by employers as well as evaluated by staff for their
effectiveness, with a good faith effort over a two year period.
 Therefore, current biennial plans must be implemented until an
employer chooses to comply with Rule 2202 or until the anniversary
of the plans when an employer will submit a triennial plan or
an annual analysis.</I>
<P>
48). Will the AQMD make a dedicated effort to have Transportation
Staff communicate the program changes through public outreach
efforts with TMAs, TMOs, ETC Network Associations etc.?
<P>
<I>Yes, the AQMD intends to continue its outreach effort with
these various groups through public briefings, consultation meetings
and other forums.  Additionally, the AQMD will summarize program
changes adopted by the Governing Board, that will go to all current
1501 and 1501.1 employers.</I>
<P>
49). Since the Employee Commute Reduction Program update training
requirement for ETCs will become voluntary, is the AQMD also considering
streamlining the initial (3 day) training program or making it
voluntary?
<P>
<I>The initial training program not only educates ETCs about the
program requirements, it also provides ETCs with resources (information,
contact persons, associations..) vital to implementing their programs.
 This training is key to establishing the framework for successful
programs and therefore will be required by employers implementing
trip reduction programs.  However, the AQMD is committed to evaluating
the current initial training program for potential streamlining
at the earliest practical date.</I>
<P>
50). Now that Parking Cash-Out will be incorporated as a strategy
option in Proposed Rule 2202, what will be the result on Proposed
Rule 1504.1 - Parking Cash-Out as well as on existing Rule 1504
- Parking Cash-Out Programs for Non-Owned Employer Parking (contingency
measure)?
<P>
<I>Once Proposed Rule 2202 has been adopted, Proposed Rule 1504.1
will not be necessary since the emissions reductions target in
1504.1 will be absorbed into Proposed Rule 2202.  There will be
no change to existing Rule 1504 (contingency measure).</I>
<P>
51). Will the biennial plan forms be further streamlined?
<P>
<I>Staff is committed to continue streamlining the plan forms
to request information that is necessary for program evaluation.
 Staff welcomes input or suggestions on areas in which the plan
forms may be further streamlined.</I>
<P>
52). Can employers implement emissions reduction strategies/options
not included in Proposed Rule 2202?
<P>
<I>Employers may only receive emission reduction credit for strategy
options included in Rule 2202.  Staff will work closely with employers
to discuss potential credit for alternative strategies not explicitly
included in Rule 2202 and will make every attempt to incorporate
new and innovative strategies.</I>
<P>
53). What is the overall emission reduction targets of Proposed
Rule 2202, per pollutant?
<P>
<I>Proposed Rule 2202 is designed to reduce equivalent emissions
to those currently achieved under Rules 1501 and 1501.1 projected
forward for 1995 and 1996. The emission reductions for 1997 are
estimated at 10.6 ton/pay of VOC, 7.8 tons/day of NOx and 81.4
tons/day of CO.  For 1997 and subsequent years, the rule is designed
to reduce emissions that would achieve the performance target
of the federal Clean Air Act and those accounted for in the 1994
AQMP for Proposed Rule 1504.1 - Parking Cash-Out.</I>
<P>
54). What is the fee structure of Rule 2202?
<P>
<I>Employers under Rule 2202 will be subject to the fee schedule
contained in subdivisions (c) and (d) of Rule 306.  Employee Commute
Reduction Programs are subject to Rule 308.</I>
<P>
55). Rule 2202 does not offer a default AVR credit and AVR surveys
are too expensive to conduct.  Is there an alternative to conducting
an AVR survey to claim VTECs?
<P>
<I>Yes, rule language has been added that would allow an employer
to use data based on the weighted average of the AVRs of the last
three years of surveys as an alternative to conducting an actual
survey.</I>
<H1><B><A NAME="_Toc342271463">VIII. FINDINGS REQUIRED BY THE
CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE</A></B></H1>

<P>
Health and Safety Code Section 40727 required the AQMD to adopt
written finding of necessity, authority, clarity, consistency,
non-duplication and reference.
<P>
<B>Necessity</B> - As set forth in the adopted AQMP, the emission
reductions associated with Proposed Rule 2202 are needed for the
following reasons:
<P>
a) State and federal health-based ambient air quality standards
for ozone are regularly and significantly violated in the South
Coast Air Basin.  The extensive reduction of VOC and NOx emissions
(precursors to ozone formation) and CO, including the reductions
from Proposed Rule 2202 is needed to meet federal and state air
quality standards.
<P>
b) By exceeding state and federal air quality standards, the health
of people within the South Coast Air Basin is impaired.
<P>
c) By exceeding state and federal air quality standards, the quality
of life is reduced in the South Coast Air Basin in numerous respects.
<P>
d) The &quot;California Clean Air Act&quot; (CH&amp;SC &#167;
40910 et seq.) requires that the AQMD make every effort to attain
federal and state ambient air quality standards as soon as practicable.
 Proposed Rule 2202 makes progress toward that goal.
<P>
e) Proposed Rule 2202 is intended to replace Rules 1501 and 1501.1
with an alternative means of compliance with AQMD regulations.
<P>
<B>Authority</B> - The AQMD Board obtains its authority to adopt,
amend, or repeal rules and regulations from Health &amp; Safety
Code Sections 40000, 40001, 40440, 40441, 40463, 40702, 40716,
40725 through 40728, and 40910 through 40920.
<P>
<B>Clarity</B> - The AQMD Board determines that Proposed Rule
2202 is written or displayed so that its meaning can be easily
understood by persons directly affected by it.
<P>
<B>Consistency</B> - The AQMD Board determines that Proposed Rule
2202 is in harmony with, and not in conflict with or contradictory
to existing federal or state statutes, court decisions or regulations.
<P>
<B>Non-Duplication</B> - Proposed Rule 2202 does not impose the
same requirements as any existing state or federal regulation
and is necessary and proper to execute the powers and duties granted
to, and imposed upon, the AQMD.
<P>
<B>Reference</B> - In adopting this Proposed Rule, the AQMD Board
references the following statutes which the AQMD hereby implements,
interprets or makes specific: H&amp;SC Section 40001 (rules to
achieve ambient air quality standards), and 40440(a) (rules to
carry out AQMP), 40918 (requirements for moderate and above areas),
40920 (requirements for severe and above areas), 40920.5 (requirements
for extreme areas) and Federal Clean Air Act Section 182(d)(1)(B),
42 USC Section 75112(d)(1)(B) (employee commute options requirements).

<BODY>


<P> Cody Cluff was appointed to the AQMD Governing Board on December 12, 1996, by Governor Pete Wilson to serve as the Governor&#146;s representative.
<P> Cluff is president of the Entertainment Industry Development Corporation (EIDC), an entertainment industry-government partnership working to enhance the regional economy by promoting Los Angeles as the entertainment capital of the world.  EIDC&#146;s mission is to create a strong relationship between government and the $20-billion entertainment industry to benefit both the region&#146;s business climate and the communities where filming takes place.
<P> Thanks largely to Cluff and his staff at EIDC, film production in Los Angeles has soared nearly 50%.  Under Cluff, EIDC established a one-stop commercial center to facilitate commercial production, and he is currently designing a state-of-the-art online permitting system that will dramatically streamline the permitting process for location shooting.  Cluff has taken an active interest in furthering AQMD&#146;s similar pilot online permitting system for certain types of equipment.
<P> As Mayor Riordan&#146;s liaison to the entertainment industry, Cluff was the driving force behind merging the Los Angeles city and county film offices into EIDC.  He also worked with government and industry to reduce burdensome requirements while maintaining filming safety standards and brought the music industry&#146;s Grammy Awards back to Los Angeles.   Prior to serving on Mayor Riordan&#146;s staff, Cluff was executive director of the Los Angeles County Film Office, where he assisted film companies in project development, privatized the county&#146;s permit office and increased office productivity.
<P> Before heading the county film office, Cluff was director of business retention for the Economic Development Corporation of Los Angeles County.  He created and implemented &quot;L.A. Means Business!,&quot; an outreach program to improve the relationship between businesses and government.
<P> A believer in strong civic involvement, Cluff served on the Community Air Quality Task Force advising the AQMD Governing Board, and on the Regional Water Quality Board, dealing with policy, environmental and quality-of-service issues.  Cluff currently serves on the boards of the San Gabriel Valley Commerce and Cities Consortium, Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, Southern California Council on Environment and Development, L.A. Sports and Entertainment Commission, Boy Scouts of America and USC&#146;s Entertainment Technology Center.
 <P>Cluff and his wife, Marilyn, have three children and make their home in Covina.

<P><a name = "streamlined"><h3>Permits May Be Streamlined, Scrapped For Thousands of Southland Firms</h3>
<P>Up to 20,000 air quality permits --- a quarter of the total -- will be eliminated or streamlined over the next three years as another plank in Chairman Jon Mikels' 1996 Regulatory Reform platform is nailed down in the months ahead.
<P> AQMD is considering a three-tiered approach to permitting that will either eliminate or significantly reduce permitting requirements for thousands of businesses throughout the Southland.
<P> &quot;With these changes, along with our upcoming over-the-counter permits,&quot; said Mikels, &quot;we're trying to make getting an air quality permit as easy as ordering a pizza.&quot;
<P> Executive Officer James M. Lents said the streamlining process will cut red tape for businesses without slowing the region's progress toward clean air.
<P> &quot;We're going to eliminate permits for some equipment that pollutes only minimally, and this includes equipment used by thousands of small businesses throughout the basin,&quot; said Lents.  
<P> &quot;We're also going to write shorter permits in plain English that don't require a lawyer or environmental consultant to interpret.&quot;
<P> The three tiers are envisioned as follows:
<P>AQMD will amend its Rule 219 to exempt several types of equipment from permitting requirements.  Criteria for exemption will be that the equipment either does not pollute or is subject to another agency's air quality standards, such as the California Air Resources Board or the federal Environmental Protection Agency.
<P> One-time registrations may replace annual permits for several types of equipment.  Businesses will have simplified compliance requirements and reduced fees.
<P>Permits for individual pieces of equipment at thousands more businesses, such as dry cleaners, gas stations, hotels, hospitals and schools, will be consolidated over the next two to three years into simple, plain English, facility permits.
<p><A HREF="#whatsinside"><IMG SRC="/icon/upline.gif" ALT="Upline"></A>
<P><a name = "approves"><h3>Board Approves $4.7 Million For Clean Air Vehicle Projects</h3>
<P>The Board in July approved $4.7 million for clean air projects around the region under a program funded by a small surcharge on motor vehicle registrations.
<P> Funding will help reduce pollution from motor vehicles through a combination of projects that will put cleaner trucks on the road, increase the use of bicycles and spur research on cleaner automotive technologies for the future.
<P> AQMD&#146;s Board approved the projects for funding as recommended by the Mobile Source Air Pollution Reduction Review Committee, an independent body of locally-elected officials chartered by the state Legislature to administer funds raised through the vehicle registration surcharge.
<P> Among the leading projects approved were:
<P><ul><li> $1.5 million toward a $5.4 million project that will convert 50 diesel trucks operated by The Perrier Group of America, Anaheim Disposal Trucking Unlimited and the County Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County to run on cleaner liquefied natural gas;
<p><li> $1.5 million toward a $3.8 million project that will put 40 low-polluting compressed natural gas trucks into service for street sweeping, trash hauling and other uses throughout the area;
<p><li> $210,000 toward a $500,000 project to demonstrate a plasma-assisted catalyst designed to provide highly efficient control of nitrogen oxide and particulate emissions from diesel engines; and
<p><li> $150,000 toward a $322,000 training program for local government officials on how to reduce motor vehicle emissions through improved land-use planning.
</ul><P> Numerous bicycle and other research projects also were funded on a cost-shared basis.
<p><A HREF="#whatsinside"><IMG SRC="/icon/upline.gif" ALT="Upline"></A>
<P><a name = "permit"><h3>Permit Processing Enhancement Due</h3>
<P>Beginning Oct. 1, Southland businesses will enjoy further improvements in the way air quality permit applications are received and processed that will further reduce issuance time for many.
<P> Enhancements will include:
<P><ul><li> Consolidating many application forms that need to be completed;
<li> Improving prescreening review of the completeness of applications; and
<li> Providing better information to applicants that will help avoid delays in permit processing.
</ul><P> Forms for certain equipment categories also will be available on the Internet and AQMD staff is redesigning procedures for determining which applications can be processed in seven, 30 or 180 days.
<P> Shortly after the program starts, many businesses will be able to obtain a wide variety of air quality permits &quot;over-the-counter.&quot;
<P> Automotive spray booths and emergency internal combustion engines will be among the first equipment eligible for these instant permits.  Additional equipment is being evaluated for eventual inclusion.
<P> AQMD will publicize these improvements through extensive outreach, including brochures, flyers and other materials.
<P> For further information about the permit application processing enhancement program, please call Todd Iwata, project coordinator at (909) 396-2574.

<P><a name = "proposed rule"><h3>Proposed Rule Will Cut Solvent Cleaning Emissions 
  While Saving Southland Businesses Money</h3>
<P>A plan to replace petroleum solvents, primarily with water-based cleaners, will save businesses money and significantly reduce smog-forming emissions.
<P>The Governing Board this month considers a proposal to virtually eliminate, by 1999, volatile organic compounds in industrial cleaning products used in many industries.
<P> Rule 1171 would lower the VOC content of general cleaning solvents from today's limit of 900 grams per liter to 50 grams per liter by Jan. 1, 1999.
<P> &quot;This rule presents a true win-win opportunity, since it will help clean the air and save businesses money at the same time,&quot; said James M. Lents, executive officer.
<P> &quot;That's because water-based cleaners are usually cheaper to buy and use than petroleum solvent-based products.&quot;
<P>Cleaning solvents are widely used by tens of thousands of Southland businesses, from automotive shops to printers.
<P> Industrial solvent cleaning now accounts for 36 tons per day of VOC emissions &#149; nearly three times that of all of the region's oil refineries.
<P> The AQMD proposal would reduce VOC emissions from industrial cleaning compounds by 20.5 tons per day by 2010.  It is one of the largest VOC emission-reduction rules remaining in AQMD's clean air plan to achieve federal health standards by 2010.
<P> In addition to cleaning up the air, Lents said, water-based cleaners may significantly reduce waste disposal costs associated with petroleum solvents.
<P> A number of low- and zero-VOC water-based cleaners are on the market today, and approximately one in five companies already use them, according to an AQMD survey completed this year.
<P>Businesses could comply with the rule by using water-based solvents or acetone &#149; a solvent that does not contribute to smog formation.
<P> An AQMD analysis estimated that the net savings to all Southland businesses from switching to water-based solvents would be about $4 million to $5 million a year.
<P> The proposed rule also creates an incentive for using ultra-clean materials certified by AQMD as &quot;Clean Air Solvents.&quot;  Such solvents would have to meet even stricter requirements than the rule for volatility and smog-forming potential.
<P> The use of &quot;Clean Air Solvents&quot; would save businesses even more money because the businesses would be exempt from the rule, would not be required to have an AQMD permit and would not incur any fees.
<P> For more information, call Lou Yuhas at (909) 396-2475.

<P><a name = "paints"><h3>Small Container Exemption Reinstated for Paints</h3>
<P>The AQMD&#146;s Governing Board has fulfilled a commitment made to the paint industry earlier this year and reinstated an exemption for volatile organic compound limits of coatings in small containers.
<P> The exemption applies to containers of one quart or smaller, and allows paint manufacturers, distributors and consumers to use specialty and touch-up paints that would not meet VOC content limits in AQMD&#146;s Rule 1113.
<P> Under the exemption, consumers using a coating today would be able to buy a small container of the same material in the future for touch-up and repair even though proposed VOC limits would prohibit the sale of the coating in coming years.
<P> A previous small container exemption expired in December 1993.
<P> The exemption will result in a small VOC emissions increase, estimated at 0.5 tons per day, but it will be more than offset by reductions from a proposed tightening of VOC limits in Rule 1113.  That measure is scheduled to be considered by AQMD&#146;s Governing Board later this year.
<P> For more information, contact AQMD&#146;s Naveen Berry at 909-396-2363.

<P><a name = "bicycles"><h3>Clean Air Electric Bicycles Now Available</h3>
<P>Electric bicycles, an increasingly popular mode of zero-emission transportation, now are being sold at car dealerships across the Southland.
<P> Electric bicycles use a rechargeable battery mounted on the bike to provide some or all of the power needed to drive the wheels.  Electric bicycles make it easier for commuters to get to work without working up a sweat.  They are also being used to expand the range and effectiveness of police officers on bicycle patrol.
<p><center><img src = "evbike.gif"><h5>Electric bicycles, including some models sold at car dealerships, are becoming popular among commuters and community police patrols</h5></center>
<P> Electric assist units, which can be fitted to most bicycles, sell for $579.
<P> A new state law has cleared legal obstacles to the widespread use of electric bicycles.  Formerly, electric bicycles had to have license plates and riders had to have a motorcycle driver's license and a motorcycle helmet.  
<P> As of Jan. 1, 1996, riders no longer have to meet those requirements.  They do have to be at least 16 years old and wear a bicycle helmet.

<P><a name = "funds"><h3>Board Funds Air Quality Investment Program Projects</h3>
<P>AQMD's Governing Board committed $2.67 million this summer from the Air Quality Investment Program for several projects reducing mobile source emissions.
<P>Programs funded include:
<P><ul><li> $540,000 towards the construction of a natural gas vehicle fueling station in Whittier Union High School District;
<P><li> $578,956 for the use of remote sensing equipment to test emissions of 60,000 vehicles at Southland colleges and universities, and for the repair of the 600 highest polluters;
<br><li> $1.38 million to scrap old, high-emitting vehicles at Ecology Auto Wrecking, Inc.; and
<P><li>$176,000 for CNG-fueled rail feeder shuttles in Southeast Los Angeles.</ul>
<P> The Air Quality Investment program is funded by companies that choose to utilize this option under AQMD's Rule 2202 to reduce mobile source emissions.  Employers can opt out by paying $60 per year for each employee arriving during the peak commute period, or $125 per employee for three years.
<P> AQIP funds provide only a portion of the total cost of projects, the balance of which is paid for by other organizations and businesses.

<P><a name = "product"><h3>Calling Clean Product Makers: AQMD To Open Exhibit Hall</h3>
<P>Clean equipment and product makers are being invited to exhibit at AQMD's planned Clean Technology Center.
<P> &quot;Our center will provide the thousands of businesses AQMD works with the chance to see the latest in the clean technologies they can use,&quot; said LaRonda Bowen, Public Advisor.  &quot;Exhibitors will gain a prime opportunity to market their products directly to end users and to help educate the public about the causes and effects of air pollution and what technologies are needed to solve the problem.&quot;
<P> CTC will feature several exhibits each year based on clean technology themes, the first of which will be electric technologies -- from electric vehicles to electric gardening equipment -- that can help clean up smog.
<P> Future exhibits will be based on such themes as clean combustion technology, consumer products, printing technologies, auto body coating and restaurant equipment.
<P> AQMD will market exhibit space to makers of &quot;super-compliant&quot; technologies --- those that surpass AQMD standards.
<P> AQMD then will market the exhibits to the 30,000 businesses it regulates, some 60 visiting delegations a year from other states and nations interested in air pollution control, and the public at large.
<P> The center will be located on the first floor of AQMD's Diamond Bar headquarters building off the main lobby near the public meeting room center.
<P> Exhibitors will be able to contract for exhibit spaces for agreed upon periods of time.
<P> AQMD is developing an information kit for prospective exhibitors.  To get one, call Al Baez at (909) 396-2516.

<P><B><a NAME="Enforcing">Enforcing Health Standards</B></A></P>
<P>Under both federal and state law, the South Coast Air Quality Management District is under a legal obligation to make and enforce air pollution regulations.  These regulations are primarily meant to ensure that the surrounding (or ambient) air will meet federal and state air quality standards.  However, AQMD also has broad authority to regulate toxic and hazardous air emissions, and these regulations are enforced in the same manner as those which pertain to the ambient air quality standards.  </P>
<P>These ambient air standards are health-based and concern the following six air contaminants:  sulfur dioxide, lead, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, and fine particulate matter.  </P>
<P>These standards are designed to protect the most sensitive persons from illness or discomfort with a margin of safety.   The four-county region within AQMD's jurisdiction complies with standards for the first two, but fails to meet standards for the other four.  In addition, AQMD must meet California standards for hydrogen sulfide, sulfates, and vinyl chloride, as well as state standards for visibility.  </P>
<P>California requires a reduction in district-wide emissions of five percent or more per year until these standards are met.  California has also set statewide emission limitations for odor or unhealthful emissions, visible emissions, open burning, sandblasting, gasoline vapors, and incineration of toxics.</P>
<P> </P>
<P><B><a NAME="Background">Background on Emission Sources</B></A></P>
<P>Regarding the four air contaminants for which AQMD is out of attainment, carbon monoxide (CO) is formed by the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels and comes almost entirely from automobile exhaust.  Carbon monoxide can cause dizziness and fatigue, and can impair central nervous system functions.  Controls on indirect sources which attract automobiles, such as places of employment and shopping centers, reduce the amount of CO in the surrounding air.</P>
<P>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and other oxides of nitrogen (NOx) are formed as a result of fuel combustion under high temperature or pressure, and they contribute to the problems of ground-level ozone,  fine particulate matter, poor visibility, and acid rain.  Nitrogen dioxide decreases lung function and may reduce resistance to infection.  Controls on fuel combustion, particularly internal combustion engines and large stationary sources such as power plants and refineries, reduce the concentrations of  NOx in the surrounding air.</P>
<P>Ozone is formed by photochemical reactions between oxides of nitrogen and volatile organic compounds.  VOCs are formed from the incomplete combustion of fuels and from evaporation of organic solvents.  Elevated ozone levels in the air we breathe (as opposed to the upper atmosphere where it protects us from harmful radiation) result in reduced lung function, particularly during vigorous physical activity.  This health problem is particularly acute in children because their lungs are not fully developed and they don't always recognize the symptoms that would warn adults of the effects of ozone.</P>
<P>Reducing ozone levels involves controlling both NOx and VOC emissions. NOx controls were described above. Typical VOC controls include reducing the VOC content of paints and solvents, and controlling fumes from gasoline pumping, auto body painting, furniture finishing, and other operations that involve organic chemicals and solvents.</P>
<P>PM10 refers to small suspended particulate matter, 10 microns or less in diameter, which can enter the lungs.  These small particles can be directly emitted into the atmosphere as a by-product of fuel combustion; through abrasion, such as wear on tires or brake linings; or through wind erosion of soil.  They can also be formed in the atmosphere through chemical reactions.  The particles may carry carcinogens and other toxic compounds, which stick to the particle surfaces and can enter the lung.  PM10 is reduced directly by controls on fugitive dust and indirectly by controls on all other pollutants which contribute to the formation of particles.</P>

<P><B><a NAME="Federal">Federal and State Enforcement Mandate</B></A></P>

<P>AQMD was created by the state legislature to facilitate compliance with the federal Clean Air Act and to implement the state air quality program.  Under the federal Clean Air Act, the Environmental Protection Agency is required to develop health-based air quality standards applying to all of the states, which it has done, as described above.  </P>
<P>The states are required to report to EPA on whether they meet the standards and to prepare &quot;State Implementation Plans&quot; for attainment and maintenance of the standards.  </P>
<P>If a state or an area within it does not meet the standards, the plan must contain provisions for emission limitations and controls, emission reductions pending attainment, and a permit program for new and modified equipment or devices which emit or control the emission of air pollution.  </P>
<P>In its plan, a state must provide assurances that        it will have adequate personnel, legal authority,     and funding to implement and enforce the plan.  Finally, the plan must be approved by the federal government.</P>
<P>If a state submits an inadequate plan or fails to attain the standards by the deadlines established by the EPA, the consequences could be severe, including the imposition of a Federal Implementation Plan, a construction ban on certain new or modified sources, or a citizen's suit to enforce the state plan.  </P>
<P>The state legislature conducts regular audits of AQMD activities to ensure that this will not happen.  Contrary to what people might think, the AQMD exists solely to implement state and federal law for the purpose of protecting public health.  If it fails to do this, however, both the state and federal government may assume authority over the AQMD's regulatory program.</P>

<P><B><a NAME="Statutory">Statutory Penalties for Air Pollution Violations</B></A></P>

<P>Air pollution violations may result in either criminal or civil liability.  AQMD does not have the authority to criminally prosecute an air pollution violation.  Criminal cases must be handled by state, county or city attorneys.  In deciding whether to refer a case  for criminal prosecution, AQMD will consider such factors as the type and severity of the violation, the state of mind of the violator, and the harm or risk of harm to the public created by the violation.  Criminal penalties are contained in California Health and Safety Code sections 42400, 42400.1, 42400.2 and 42400.3.  These sections are reprinted in the back of this pamphlet.</P>
<P>AQMD's enforcement authority for civil penalties, as required by the State Implementation Plan, can be found in the California Health and Safety Code Civil Penalties sections 42402, 42402.1, 42402.2, and 42402.3.  These sections, which are reprinted in     the back of this pamphlet, provide increasing levels of civil liability depending on the nature of the     violation.  </P>
<P><B><a NAME="$1,000">$1,000 per Day Strict Liability</B></A></P>
<P>Under Section 42402(a), a person is strictly liable for a civil penalty of $1,000 per day for violating any provision of the Health and Safety Code section within Part 4 of Division 26 of the code or any order, permit, rule, or regulation of a district, including a district hearing board, or of the state Air Resources Board issued pursuant to Parts 1 through 4 of Division 26 of the code.  </P>
<P>What this means in plain language is that a person who violates any provision of the Health and Safety Code or an AQMD rule, regulation, order or permit, regardless of an emission violation, is strictly liable for a civil penalty of $1,000 per day. </P>

<P><B><a NAME="$10,000">$10,000 per Day</B></A></P>

<P>Under Section 42402(b), a person may be liable for a civil penalty of up to $10,000 per day if that person has violated any Health and Safety Code section in Part 4 of Division 26 of the code, or any order, permit, rule, or regulation of a district, including a district hearing board, or of the state Air Resources Board issued pursuant to Parts 1 through 4 of Division 26 of the code. </P>
<P>What this means in plain language is that a person who violates an AQMD rule, regulation, order, permit condition or applicable state law, will be subject to a civil penalty of up to $10,000 per day unless the violator can establish that the violation was not the result of intentional or negligent conduct.  If the violation involves the emission of air contaminants, the penalty could be higher than $10,000 per day. </P>

<P><B><a NAME="$15,000">$15,000 per Day</B></A></P>

<P>Under Section 42402.1, a person may be liable for a civil penalty of up to $15,000 per day if that person has negligently emitted an air contaminant in violation of Part 4 of Division 26 of the code, or any rule, regulation, permit or order of the state Air Resources Board or district board pertaining to emission regulations or limitations.</P>
<P>What this means in plain language is that a person who carelessly, inattentively, or inadvertently violates air pollution rules, causing the emission of air contaminants, will be subject to a civil penalty of up to $15,000 per day.</P>
<P>An example of such a violation would be the use of coatings containing higher levels of VOC than allowed by an AQMD rule by a person who did not make sure that the coatings complied with AQMD requirements.</P>

<P><B><a NAME="$25,000">$25,000 per Day</B></A></P>

<P>Under Section 42402.2, a person may be liable for a civil penalty of up to $25,000 per day if that person has emitted an air contaminant in violation of Part 4 of Division 26 of the code, or any order, rule, regulation, or permit of the state Air Resources Board or district board pertaining to emission regulations or limitations, provided the person knew of the emission and failed to take corrective action within a reasonable time under the circumstances.  </P>
<P>"Corrective action"; means a termination of the emission violation or the grant of a variance from the applicable order, rule, regulation or permit, or compliance with a regulation excusing the violation (such as AQMD Rule 430 applying to the breakdown of equipment).</P>
<P>What this means in plain language is that a person who violates air pollution rules will be subject to a civil penalty of up to $25,000 per day if the violation causes the emission of an air contaminant and the person knows of the emission without acting promptly to halt the emission. </P>
<P>What matters is that there was a violation that caused an emission and the person knew of the emission without acting as quickly as he could have to stop it.  The person&#213;s knowledge of the emission and the failure to act promptly are the key elements in making this a serious type of violation.</P>

<P><B><a NAME="$50,000">$50,000 Penalty</B></A></P>

<P>Under Section 42402.3, a person may be liable for a civil penalty of up to fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) if that person willfully and intentionally emits an air contaminant in violation of any Health and Safety Code section in Part 4 of Division 26 of the code or any order, rule or regulation of the state Air Resources Board or district pertaining to emission regulations or limitations.</P>

<P><B><a NAME="Violations">Violations of Variances and Orders for Abatement</B></A></P>

<P>The penalty statutes discussed above apply as well to violations of variance conditions and Orders for Abatement issued by the district hearing board. </P>

<P><B><a NAME="Falsificaiton">Falsification of Records</B></A></P>

<P>AQMD's air regulatory program includes record-keeping requirements which allow AQMD to verify source compliance with air pollution rules and regulations.  Subdivision (b) of Section 42402.2 provides a penalty of up to $25,000 for falsifying records with the intent to deceive AQMD.</P>

<P><B><a NAME="Policy">Policy of Judging Each Violation Individually</B></A></P>

<P>As a matter of state law, a judge or jury is obligated to evaluate each violation individually and with reference to all relevant facts and circumstances.  This is an important legislative policy that the AQMD follows in negotiating settlements.  This policy recognizes that what might be a fair penalty for a large refinery might not be for a three-person metal stamping operation, despite the fact that the same rule was violated.  </P>
<P>Under such a policy, AQMD considers such factors as the financial burden to the violator or the action taken to correct the violation, thus allowing a &quot;sliding scale&quot; in negotiating the appropriate penalty.  Without such a policy, all violators would have to be treated exactly alike without regard for the factors which can make one violation different from another.  The California Health and Safety Code requires that the following factors be considered in assessing civil penalties:</P>
<P>(a)  The extent of harm caused by the violation.</P>
<P>(b)  The nature and persistence of the violation.</P>
<P>(c)  The length of time over which the violation occurs.</P>
<P>(d) The frequency of past violations.</P>
<P>(e)  The record of maintenance.</P>
<P>(f)  The unproven or innovative nature of the control equipment.</P>
<P>(g)  Any action taken by the defendant to mitigate the violation.</P>
<P>(h)  The financial burden to the defendant.</P>
<P>While it is clearly important for AQMD to make and enforce air pollution regulations to comply with federal and state law and to protect public health, it is also important to recognize that the regulated community is made up of all kinds and sizes of  businesses.  </P>
<P>The legislative policy of individualized attention to air pollution violations allows AQMD to pursue its legal obligations and mandates while carefully judging all of the circumstances of each air pollution  violation.</P>

Clean Air Partners Awards Facilities<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
Twenty-six facilities have earned an &quot;A+&quot; for their
exceptional efforts at achieving early compliance with the monitoring,
reporting and recordkeeping requirements of the RECLAIM rules.
For their efforts each company will be presented with a Clean
Air Partners Award during the Governing Board Hearing on January
12, 1996.<BR>

<P>
On October 15, 1993, the AQMD Governing Board adopted the RECLAIM
program. The goal of the RECLAIM program is to provide facilities
with added flexibility in meeting emission reduction requirements
and lower the cost of compliance. The implementation of RECLAIM
during the first compliance year was highly successful. Please
see the companion report on this agenda for the first RECLAIM
Annual Report.<BR>

<P>
Compliance rates were very high for the first year of the program;
and, many companies deserve praise. However, 26 companies earned
an &quot;A+.&quot; The criteria for the Clear Air Partners Awards
were:<BR>

<P>
Early installation and operation of monitoring equipment; and,
<P>
Consistent and correct reporting of emissions.<BR>

<P>
To these facilities we offer deepest congratulations -- job well
done!<BR>

must aggressively have mobile source emissions reduced if this
region is to meet air quality standards. 3) Introduced Mr. Leon
Billings, AQMD's representative in Washington, D.C. since 1987,
who spoke briefly on his representation of the AQMD during consideration
of the 1990 Clean Air Act and highlighted current events in Washington
concerning clean air. Mr. Billings' contract with AQMD is ending,
and in appreciation to the Board for their support and allowing
him the opportunity to represent AQMD, Mr. Billings presented
the Board with a reproduction of the title and signature pages
of the 1990 Clean Air Act bearing the signatures of President
Bush and then-senate majority pro tem <BR>
Robert C. Berg.<BR>

<P>

in the recruitment of AQMD's senior personnel,<BR>

<P>
MR. HEWITT MOVED THAT UPON THE VACANCY IN ANY OF THE POSITIONS
LISTED BELOW OR SUCH EQUIVALENT POSITIONS AS MAY BE CREATED, WHETHER
THAT VACANCY OCCURS DUE TO RESIGNATION, RETIREMENT, DISMISSAL,
TRANSFER OR ANY OTHER REASON, THE ADMINISTRATIVE COMMITTEE SHALL
APPOINT A SEARCH COMMITTEE CONSISTING OF THREE BOARD MEMBERS,
THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER, AND ONE MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC SELECTED BY
THE CHAIR, TO CONDUCT A SEARCH FOR THE REPLACEMENT OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE
TO RECOMMEND ABOLITION OF THE POSITION. THE SEARCH COMMITTEE SHALL
MAKE ITS RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE FULL BOARD FOR BOARD ACTION.

<P>
THE MOTION WAS SECONDED BY MS. SOTO.<BR>

<P>
Messrs. Braude and Loveridge expressed opposition to the motion,
primarily because it would dissipate the authority and accountability
of the Executive Officer for the performance of senior management
staff.<BR>

<P>
Mr. Paulitz commented that of the positions mentioned, he would
possibly want the Executive Officer to consult with a committee
or send it through the committee informing them of his plans only
with respect to four positions: DEO/Planning, Transportation,
and Information Management, DEO/Stationary Source Compliance,
Chief Scientist and General Counsel. He also suggested that perhaps
the Board should consider performance reviews for General Counsel
and the Executive Officer positions. He expressed opposition to
the motion, unless it was significantly modified.<BR>

<P>
Speaking in support of the motion, Ms. Soto expressed her belief
that the best way to get accountability would be through the proposed
committee.<BR>

<P>
MR. HEWITT AMENDED HIS MOTION TO LIMIT IT TO FOUR POSITIONS: DEO/PLANNING,
TRANSPORTATION, &amp; INFORMATION MANAGEMENT, DEO/STATIONARY SOURCE
COMPLIANCE, CHIEF SCIENTIST AND GENERAL COUNSEL. MS. SOTO SECONDED
THE AMENDED MOTION.<BR>

<P>
Dr. Wilson commented that while he appreciated the spirit of the
motion, Riverside County's Board of Supervisors recently heard
a report from a committee that was charged with a year-long study
of reorganization and restructuring of Riverside County's government.
One of the strongest recommendations the committee brought forward
was that Riverside give the responsibility of hiring and firing
and accountability to their Chief Administrative Officer, rather
than having the Board micro-managing all of those decisions. He
supported that recommendation; and for that reason, he opposed
the motion.<BR>

<P>
Expressing opposition to the motion, Dr. Burke commented that
since the Administrative Committee has the responsibility for
oversight of personnel matters, he did not think it was necessary
for the Board to overlap that responsibility.<BR>

<P>
Chairman Mikels pointed out that all of the positions first mentioned
are under contract, and in addition to being reviewed by the Administrative
Committee, those contracts must be approved by the Board before
they can be enacted. Also, the Board directly appoints the General
Counsel, so that position is irrelevant as part of the amended
motion. He preferred to leave the recruitment effort in the hands
of the Executive Officer, let him make the decisions and hold
the Executive Officer accountable. The positions discussed, with
the exception of General Counsel, are responsible and answerable
directly to the Executive Officer and not the Board.<BR>

<P>
(Mr. Antonovich arrived at 10:15 a.m.)<BR>

<P>
Commenting that it did not appear that there would be seven affirmative
votes for the amended motion, <BR>

<P>
MR. HEWITT WITHDREW HIS MOTION AND MOVED THAT THE BOARD CONTINUE
THIS ITEM TO THE DECEMBER 7, 1995 BOARD MEETING. THE MOTION WAS
SECONDED BY MS. SOTO.<BR>

<P>
Dr. Lents responded that recruitment for the positions mentioned
has never been held entirely within the agency, and an outside
panel is always created to screen candidates and select the top
candidates. Once he makes a decision on who to hire, then he must
get the ratification of the Board on that contract, so the Board
does have the opportunity to disagree with the candidate selected
and send it back. He believed it would impact the Executive Officer's
ability to manage the staff to have the Board take over the recruitment/selection
process, and it seemed to him inappropriate and duplicative for
Board members to be involved in the candidate selection process
and approval of the contract as well.<BR>

<P>
Mr. Braude commented that Mr. Hewitt could request that this matter
be considered by the Administrative Committee, but he believed
it was inappropriate to continue this item to next month's Board
meeting in expectation of seven affirmative votes.<BR>

<P>
THE MOTION BY MR. HEWITT TO CONTINUE AGENDA ITEM NO. 38 TO THE
DECEMBER 7, 1995 BOARD MEETING FAILED BY THE FOLLOWING VOTE:<BR>

<P>
AYES: Antonovich, Hewitt and Soto.<BR>

<P>
NOES: Braude, Burke, Haggard, Loveridge, Mikels, Paulitz and Wilson.
<BR>

<P>
ABSENT: Lee and Silva.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
ON MOTION OF MR. BRAUDE, DULY SECONDED, A UNANIMOUS VOTE WAS CAST
BY THE BOARD MEMBERS PRESENT (Absent: Lee and Silva) REFERRING
AGENDA ITEM NO. 38 TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE COMMITTEE.<BR>

<P>
Chairman Mikels indicated that the item would be placed on the
agenda for the next meeting of the Administrative Committee.<BR>

<P>
<U><B>PUBLIC HEARINGS<BR>
</B></U>
<P>
39. Amend Regulation XIII - New Source Review and Rule 212 - Standards
for Approving Permits<BR>

<P>
Anupom Ganguli, Senior Manager/Stationary Source Compliance, presented
the staff report. Staff recommended that the Board direct staff
to return to the Board within four months with a report on resolution
of the following issues:<BR>

<P>
(i) <B>Federal Land Manager (FLM) Notification and Visibility
Analysis Requirements</B> - staff believes further work can be
done in this area;<BR>

<P>
(ii) <B>Defining Start of Construction Pursuant to Clean Air Act
Requirements</B> - this definition belongs in a Regulation II
rule other than Rule 212 and staff is requesting a continuation
so that the rule can be approved by EPA as soon as possible; and
<BR>

<P>
(iii) <B>Continued Exemption of Private Landfills as Essential
Public Services</B> - this will require recirculation of the Environmental
Assessment.<BR>

<P>
In keeping with those three items, staff distributed to Board
members, and made copies available to members of the audience,
replacement pages for PAR 1302 and PAR 1303 and a revised Resolution
for PAR 212 and PAR XIII.<BR>

<P>
In response to a comment by Ms. Soto, staff agreed to report on
the impact to small businesses when staff reports back to the
Board in one year on the effectiveness of the tracking system
and the overall NSR offset requirements relative to state and
federal requirements.<BR>

<P>
Pat Leyden, DEO of Stationary Source Compliance, commented that
staff was asked by the Stationary Source Committee to invite EPA
to attend the public hearing on this item to answer any questions
the Board might have of EPA. However, David Howekamp was unable
to attend the public hearing because of EPA's present budget constraints.
Mr. Howekamp had, however, faxed to staff his testimony on this
item, copies of which were distributed to Board members. Ms. Leyden
read excerpts from Mr. Howekamp's testimony supporting the proposed
amendments and expressing EPA's commitment to work with staff
on resolving outstanding issues related to construction activities,
implementation of an enhanced NSR tracking system and visibility
analysis/FLM notification.<BR>

<P>
*Submitted Written Comments<BR>

<P>
Following is a summary of the main issues raised and recommendations
made during public testimony.<BR>

<P>
<B>Issue</B>: &quot;Potential to emit&quot; vs. &quot;actual emissions&quot;.
The proposed four tons per year exemption will not allow existing
small businesses with actual emissions less than four tons per
year to accept permit conditions limiting them to that amount
if they have the potential to emit more than four tons per year.
Small businesses cannot then access the small business BACT.<BR>

<P>
<B>Recommendation</B>: Supportive of Ms. Soto's recommendation
that staff report back in one year after evaluating the potential
impacts on small businesses.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<B>Issue</B>: Consistency for the definition of &quot;small business&quot;.
<BR>

<P>
<B>Recommendation</B>: The definition in Regulation XIII be consistent
with the recent BACT Methodology Report adopted by the Board.
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<B>Issue</B>: NSR potential impact on retail gasoline outlets.
Elimination of the Community Bank differentially penalizes high
volume gasoline outlets, with no environmental benefits.<BR>

<P>
<B>Recommendation</B>: Provide an exemption for all retail gasoline
outlets; or keep the VOC threshold at its current 5.5 tons per
year level, rather than 4 tons per year.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<B>Issue</B>: Assurance that EPA's interpretation is the same
as AQMD's with respect to the scope of modifications that would
trigger NSR and use of Title V (Regulation XXX) certifications
of compliance rather than requiring a separate certification for
Regulation XIII.<BR>

<P>
<B>Recommendation</B>: The Board direct staff to include this
among the issues for further discussion and work with the affected
industry and with EPA to seek EPA's explicit written agreement
as to their interpretation of the same key provisions. Also, that
staff report back to the Board on the options available for seeking
additional flexibility in NSR rules and regulations.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<B>Issue</B>: FLM notification and visibility analysis requirements
will increase the workload for FLMs and the Forest Service, which
are understaffed; and will impact businesses because each new
permit or change to an existing permit will require an expensive
visibility study.<BR>

<P>
<B>Recommendation</B>: Conduct one visibility study for the entire
basin, and remove the requirements of visibility determinations
from individual facilities. Defer the visibility issue to work
on resolving the issue, as recommended by staff.<BR>

<P>
<B>Issue</B>: The proposed provision that internal combustion
engines not be kept at one facility for more than one year is
impractical. Such equipment cannot meet the ground level impact
modeling requirements of Rule 1303 and would not be able to be
moved around a facility if required to be connected to enormous
control equipment, i.e., ammonia tanks and metering equipment.
<BR>

<P>
<B>Recommendation</B>: Amend Regulation XIII to include the definition
of &quot;location&quot; that is being proposed in PR 2100 (Agenda
Item No. 41) instead of &quot;facility&quot;. The definition in
PR 2100 allows facilities to move portable equipment from site
to site within a facility and have each of those sites considered
a new location, so that the 12-month timeclock starts over at
each site. With respect to storage yards where portable equipment
is stored and not operated, either exempt storage yards from the
one-year location restriction or retain the word &quot;used&quot;
in Rule 1304 (a)(8) so that equipment sitting idle at a storage
yard would not be required to be removed or replaced. Additionally,
Rule 219 (l)(3), which limits operation of portable rental equipment
to 90 days or less at a site, should be amended as soon as possible
to be consistent with the one-year location in the EPA non-road
definitions.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<B>Issue</B>: Use of the term &quot;source&quot; in the applicability
provision is inconsistent with the intent of Regulation XIII,
which deals with &quot;permit unit&quot;. The second sentence
in Rule 1302 (g) states that &quot;source&quot; includes any permit
unit in any non-RECLAIM facility and any device at a RECLAIM facility.
<BR>

<P>
<B>Recommendation</B>: Modify the regulation to define &quot;source&quot;
as any permitted individual piece of equipment. Delete the second
sentence of Rule 1302(g) or have staff clarify on the record their
intent that this has no substantive effect on the calculation
of emissions in the performance of NSR; and what is meant by &quot;device
at a RECLAIM facility&quot;.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<B>Issue</B>: The amended definitions proposed for &quot;major
polluting facility&quot; and &quot;major modification&quot; in
Subparagraphs (o) and (p) of PAR 1302 are too onerous if implemented
at the one pound level.<BR>

<P>
<B>Recommendation</B>: Defer action on PAR 1302 (o) and (p) until
after EPA has published draft NSR requirements.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<B>Issue</B>: The proposed amendment to delete private landfills
from the definition of &quot;essential public service&quot; is
inconsistent with the regional approach to waste disposal in this
area, which depends on a partnership between public and private
landfills. Whether public or private, landfills provide a needed
service to citizens. Additionally, there may be a shortage of
NOx ERCs within two to three years. If no ERCs are available,
private landfills will not be able to permit flares and will not
be able to comply with AQMD rule requirements.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<B>Recommendation</B>: Retain the present definition of essential
public service. Defer action on this issue until after the Environmental
Assessment has been recirculated, as recommended by staff.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<B>Issue</B>: The NSR debt forgiveness provision proposed places
&quot;cleaner&quot; facilities at a competitive disadvantage.
<BR>

<P>
<B>Recommendation</B>: Postpone adoption of PAR 1301 (c)(2) to
allow staff time to identify those facilities in the basin that
have spent over a certain amount to erase their book balances;
and, if there are only a small number of facilities in that category,
return those credits to the facilities.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<B>Issue</B>: Essential public service projects should not be
either delayed or denied simply because of the inability to carry
over emissions credits from a previous quarter, as recommended
in PAR 1309.1.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<B>Recommendation</B>: Retain the existing provision in Rule 1309.1
that excess credits in the Priority Reserve will be available
for use in the following quarter.<BR>

There being no further testimony, the public hearing was closed.

MS. SOTO MOVED APPROVAL OF THE REVISED RESOLUTION, CERTIFYING
THE SUBSEQUENT ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND AMENDING REGULATION
XIII AND RULE 212, INCLUDING THE REVISED LANGUAGE FOR RULES 1302
(k) AND 1303 (b)(5), AS RECOMMENDED BY STAFF. THE MOTION WAS SECONDED
BY<BR>
MS. HAGGARD.<BR>

<P>
At Mr. Braude's request, Chairman Mikels indicated that the Board
would consider the eight amendments proposed by the City of L.A.
in the letter to the Board dated November 16, 1995, and then take
a recess to allow staff time to prepare a summary of the comments
made during public testimony.<BR>

<P>
MR. BRAUDE MOVED TO AMEND THE MAIN MOTION TO ADD THE FOLLOWING
LANGUAGE TO THE RESOLUTION:<BR>

<P>
<U><I>&quot;BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the AQMD Governing Board
hereby directs staff to report back to the Board within one year,
or sooner if warranted, on the impacts to small businesses, if
any, of the adopted Regulation XIII amendments. The report should
address the number of small businesses utilizing the facility
exemption, the number of small businesses required to purchase
offsets, the cost of emission reduction credits, and any other
pertinent information.&quot;<BR>
</I></U>
<P>
THE MOTION WAS SECONDED BY MS. HAGGARD.<BR>

<P>
Ms. Leyden responded that the proposed language addressed the
comment by Ms. Soto regarding potential small business impacts,
which staff agreed to include in the Resolution. Rather than introducing
a new resolution, staff recommended adding the words &quot;<U>including
potential small business impacts</U>&quot; to the fifth full paragraph
on the third page of the Resolution. Ms. Haggard asked that the
word &quot;small&quot; be deleted, because she had concerns about
larger businesses locating to this region also. Staff indicated
agreement, and Mr. Braude modified his motion as follows.<BR>

<P>
ON MOTION OF MR. BRAUDE, SECONDED BY MS. HAGGARD, A UNANIMOUS
VOTE WAS CAST BY THE BOARD MEMBERS PRESENT (Absent: Hewitt, Lee
and Silva) AMENDING THE MAIN MOTION TO MODIFY THE FIFTH PARAGRAPH
ON THE THIRD PAGE OF THE REVISED RESOLUTION AS FOLLOWS:<BR>

<P>
<I>&quot; ... The staff shall report back to the Board as required
in Regulation XIII regarding the effectiveness of the tracking
system and the overall NSR offset requirements relative to state
and federal requirements<U>, including potential business impacts</U>.&quot;
<BR>
</I>
<P>
Upon staff's indication that they had no objections or comments
regarding Items 4 and 5 in the City of L.A.'s letter,<BR>

<P>
ON MOTION OF MR. BRAUDE, SECONDED BY MS. HAGGARD, A UNANIMOUS
VOTE WAS CAST BY THE BOARD MEMBERS PRESENT (Absent: Hewitt, Lee
and Silva), AMENDING THE MAIN MOTION TO:<BR>

<P>
<B>Modify Rule 1302(gg) to read:<BR>
</B>
<P>
<I>&quot;SOURCE means any <U>permitted</U> individual unit, piece
of equipment, article, article, machine, process, contrivance,
or combination thereof, which may emit or control an air contaminant.
This includes any permit unit at any non-RECLAIM facility and
any device at a RECLAIM facility.&quot;<BR>
</I>
<P>
<B>Remove Rule 1303(b)(5)(B) and all references to Rule 1303 clause
(b)(5)(B)(i) in Rule 1303 (b)(5)(D).<BR>
</B>
<P>
With respect to Item No. 6 in the City of L.A.'s letter (maintain
the existing definition of &quot;essential public services&quot;
which is not restricted only to publicly owned/operated landfills),
<BR>
Ms. Leyden explained that staff was recommending that this issue
be deferred to a future hearing because staff needs additional
circulation time for the Environmental Assessment if the Board
wishes to exclude, as recommended by staff, private companies
from obtaining public priority offsets. If Board wishes to have
landfills--whether public or private--have access to the Priority
Reserve, the Board could take that action without continuing the
hearing.<BR>

<P>
Mr. Braude expressed his belief that private landfills should
be included in the definition of essential public service because
the real issue was guaranteeing to the public that the waste is
taken care of, not whether the facility was privately or publicly
owned. He believed the Board should encourage, rather than discourage,
private/public cooperation.<BR>

<P>
In response to a question by Ms. Soto, Ms. Leyden clarified that
private landfills have had access to NO<SUB>x</SUB> credits in
the Priority Reserve. However, there are only enough NO<SUB>x</SUB>
credits available for small businesses for approximately two more
years. If the Board decides to allow private landfills continued
access to those emission credits, it will accelerate the point
in time when there will not be any free NO<SUB>x</SUB> offsets
for small businesses.<BR>

<P>
Mr. Mikels commented that he believed deferring this issue for
four months and examining the impact would be the most prudent
action to take at this time.<BR>

<P>
ON MOTION OF MR. LOVERIDGE, SECONDED BY MR. PAULITZ, A UNANIMOUS
VOTE WAS CAST BY THE BOARD MEMBERS PRESENT (Absent: Hewitt, Lee
and Silva) AMENDING THE MAIN MOTION TO DEFER PAR 1302 (k), definition
of &quot;ESSENTIAL PUBLIC SERVICE&quot;, FOR FOUR MONTHS TO ALLOW
STAFF TIME FOR FURTHER REVIEW AND DEVELOPMENT OF A RECOMMENDATION
FOR THE BOARD'S CONSIDERATION.<BR>

<P>
Ms. Leyden commented that Items 2 and 3 in the City of L.A.'s
letter concerned the ability to use the BACT definition for small
businesses; and Items 7 and 8 of the letter related to the portable
internal combustion engine issue.<BR>

<P>
MR. BRAUDE MOVED TO AMEND THE MAIN MOTION TO:<BR>

<P>
<B>Modify Rule 1304 (d)(2)(C) to read:<BR>
</B>
<P>
<I>&quot;Any existing facility that has </I><STRIKE><I>a potential
to emit</I></STRIKE><I> <U>actual emissions</U> equal to or more
than the amounts in Table A as of (date of adoption) shall not
be eligible for this exemption.&quot;<BR>
</I>
<P>
<B>Modify Rule 1302 (ff) to read:<BR>
</B>
<P>
<I>&quot;... A facility is a major stationary source if it is
subject to Regulation XXX - Title V Permits based on subdivision
(a) of Rule 3001 - Applicability </I><STRIKE><I>or is a major
polluting facility as determined in this regulation</I></STRIKE><I>:&quot;
<BR>
</I>
<P>
<B>Modify Rule 1303 (a)(3) to read:<BR>
</B>
<P>
<I>&quot;Where the requirement of paragraph (a)(1) is applicable
to a small business that is not a<U> major stationary source subject
to Regulation XXX - Title V Permits based on subdivision (a) of
Rule 3001 - Applicability</U> </I><STRIKE><I>major polluting facility</I></STRIKE><I>,
the Executive Officer or designee shall consider cost in determining
BACT required for a new or modified source at such a facility,
provided that the applicant fully substantiates his eligibility
as a small business as defined in Rule 1302. Notwithstanding the
...&quot;<BR>
</I>
<P>
THE MOTION WAS SECONDED BY MS. HAGGARD.<BR>

<P>
In response to a question by Mr. Paulitz, Ms. Leyden explained
that small businesses are not required to spend as much for BACT
as major emitters (annual emissions of 10 tons or more). However,
if a facility has the potential to emit 10 tons or more but their
actual emissions are less than 10 tons per year, the facility
can be limited, as a condition of their permit, to less than 10
tons and qualify as a small business for the BACT cost break.
Staff concurred with the intent of the proposal by the City of
L.A., but was not agreeable to deleting &quot;major polluting
facility&quot; or &quot;potential to emit&quot; because federal
law prohibits providing BACT cost breaks to major sources and
requires NSR to start with worst case--potential to emit.<BR>

<P>
Peter Greenwald, General Counsel, expressed concern with the language
proposed by the City of L.A. in that it refers to actual emissions
and does not specify when those actual emissions took place--whether
or not they were in the past or are in the future; and if in the
past, during what period of time. Additionally, this type of an
amendment would increase the number of circumstances under which
free offsets would be issued by the AQMD. Therefore, it would
have an impact on the AQMD's demonstration of compliance with
federal and state offset requirements.<BR>

<P>
THE MOTION BY MR. BRAUDE, SECONDED BY MS. HAGGARD, TO AMEND THE
MAIN MOTION BY MODIFYING RULES 1304 (d)(2)(C), 1302 (ff) and 1303
(a)(3) WAS AMENDED BY MR. BRAUDE AND SECONDED BY MS. HAGGARD TO
DEFER THE PROPOSED MODIFICATIONS FOR FOUR MONTHS TO ALLOW STAFF
TIME FOR FURTHER REVIEW AND DEVELOPMENT OF A RECOMMENDATION FOR
THE BOARD'S CONSIDERATION. THE MOTION PASSED BY A UNANIMOUS VOTE
OF THE BOARD MEMBERS PRESENT (Absent: Hewitt, Lee and Silva).
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
MR. BRAUDE MOVED TO AMEND THE MAIN MOTION TO:<BR>

<P>
<B>Add the following definition to Rule 1302:<BR>
</B>
<P>
<U><I>LOCATION means any single site at a building, structure,
facility, or installation. For the purpose of this definition,
a site is a space occupied or to be occupied by an emission unit.
For emission units which are brought to a facility to perform
maintenance on equipment at its permanent or ordinary location,
each maintenance site shall be a separate location.<BR>
</I></U>
<P>
<B>Modify Rule 1304 (a)(7) to read:<BR>
</B>
<P>
<I>The source is periodically relocated, </I><STRIKE><I>and</I></STRIKE><I>
<U>or</U> is not located more than one year at any one <U>location</U>
</I><STRIKE><I>facility</I></STRIKE><I> in the District. <U>The
period during which the source is maintained at a storage facility
shall be excluded from the residency time determination</U>. This
does not include portable combustion engines.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<B>Modify Rule 1304 (a)(8) to read:<BR>
</B>
<P>
<I>The source is periodically relocated, as defined in 1302, </I><STRIKE><I>and</I></STRIKE><I>
<U>or</U> is not located more than one year at any one <U>location</U>
</I><STRIKE><I>facility</I></STRIKE><I> in the District provided
that: ...<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>... <U>The period during which the source is maintained at
a storage facility shall be excluded from the residency time determination.
<BR>
</U></I>
<P>
THE MOTION WAS SECONDED BY MS. HAGGARD.<BR>

<P>
Ms. Leyden responded that staff did not believe the definition
of location contained in <BR>
PR 2100 (Agenda Item No. 41) should be included in Regulation
XIII. Regulation XXI concerns small engines, below the 10-ton
threshold level, and contains emission limits and criteria consistent
with the new limits in the Federal CAA. Regulation XIII recognizes
that by exempting any small portable internal combustion engine
that meets meets those emission standards. The engines subject
to Regulation XIII are basically old pieces of equipment that
do not meet the new emission standards and are used in a portable
capacity.<BR>

<P>
In response to Ms. Soto, Ms. Leyden indicated that staff did not
concur with the requested exemption of storage facilities from
the one-year location requirement because it would be nearly impossible
to enforce. Since staff would not be at the facilities everyday,
they would not know when the equipment was being operated. <BR>

<P>
Ms. Soto and Ms. Haggard expressed concern that businesses--and
many cities--have old equipment that they continue to use year
after year because they cannot afford new equipment and/or, particularly
for public facilities, they have to get as many years of service
as possible from the equipment. It seemed unfair to expect them
to be able to replace their portable equipment with new equipment
capable of meeting present emission standards.<BR>

<P>
Ms. Haggard and Dr. Burke expressed concern with the inconsistency
in definitions, and commented that the same terms should not have
different meanings in different rules or at different times.<BR>

<P>
A VOTE WAS CAST BY BOARD MEMBERS ON THE MOTION BY <BR>
MR. BRAUDE TO AMEND THE MAIN MOTION TO:<BR>

<P>
<B>Add the following definition to Rule 1302:<BR>
</B>
<P>
<U><I>LOCATION means any single site at a building, structure,
facility, or installation. For the purpose of this definition,
a site is a space occupied or to be occupied by an emission unit.
For emission units which are brought to a facility to perform
maintenance on equipment at its permanent or ordinary location,
each maintenance site shall be a separate location.<BR>
</I></U>
<P>
<B>Modify Rule 1304 (a)(7) to read:<BR>
</B>
<P>
<I>The source is periodically relocated, </I><STRIKE><I>and</I></STRIKE><I>
<U>or</U> is not located more than one year at any one <U>location</U>

or Potential Litigation and Personnel Matters<BR>

<P>
The Board recessed to closed session at 12:55 p.m., pursuant to
Government Code Section 54956.9(a) to confer with its counsel
regarding pending litigation which has been initiated formally
and to which the District is a party. The title of the litigation
is: San Bernardino Public Employees Association v. SCAQMD, Los

<P>
<U><B>PUBLIC HEARINGS (Continued)<BR>
</B></U>
<P>
The Board reconvened at 1:30 p.m., and resumed discussion on Agenda
Item No. 39.<BR>

<P>
39. Amend Regulation XIII - New Source Review and Rule 212 - Standards
for Approving Permits<BR>

<P>
Chairman Mikels announced that because of the lack of a quorum
of Board members, with Mr. Antonovich and Dr. Burke being absent
and Mr. Hewitt having recused himself from participating on this
item, the public hearing would be continued to the December 7,
1995 Board meeting. A main motion had been placed on the floor
to approve the staff recommendation, and that motion had been
amended by several votes. Public testimony was concluded and that
portion of the hearing closed. On December 7, staff will present
a summary of the other comments and recommendations for amendments
with regard to Regulation XIII. The Board will then discuss those
recommendations and vote on the final motion.<BR>

<P>
41. Adopt Proposed Rule 2100 - Registration of Portable Equipment
<BR>

<P>
Chairman Mikels indicated that Mr. Hewitt was also recused from
voting on Agenda Item No. 41, and the public hearing on Proposed
Rule 2100 was continued to December 7, 1995.<BR>

<P>
40. Amend Rule 102 - Definition of Terms<BR>

<P>
Steve Jones, SSC Air Quality Analysis/Compliance Supervisor, presented
the staff report. The public hearing was opened, and the Board
heard testimony from the following individuals:<BR>

<P>
*MICHAEL THELEN, Dow Corning Corporation
<P>
BOBBY BUSH, Hickory Springs
<P>
TOM KANAVOS, Guardsman Products
<P>
<U>BERNARD ZYSMAN, Occidental Chemical Corporation</U>
<P>
*Submitted Written Comments<BR>

<P>
There was unanimous support expressed for staff's recommendation
to add acetone, ethane, PCBTF and VMS to the definition of Exempt
Compounds. However, Mr. Thelen expressed his disagreement with
placing these materials in Group II and felt there was sufficient
data to support these materials be exempted in Group I. The subject
materials have been used extensively for 20 years, both in the
silicon industry and in personal care. The Group II designation
is unwarranted and would place a stigma on these materials as
being potentially toxic. Consequently, companies would be reluctant
to invest resources and capital to look at these materials as
replacements for VOCs. Mr. Zysman concurred, specifically with
regard to PCBTF.<BR>

<P>
<U>Written Comments Submitted by:</U>
<P>
Robert Heller, Future Foam Inc.<BR>

<P>
Michael Mills, SSC Senior Air Quality Engineering Manager, responded
that staff had received numerous comments regarding PCBTF and
VMS, particularly concern about the lack of chronic toxicity testing.
After consulting with the Office of Environmental Health Hazard
Assessment, staff thought it would be a cautious approach to place
those two materials in the Group II category, pending additional
tests that will be performed. Subsequent to the testing, staff
may recommend that PCBTF and VMS be reclassified as Group I exempt
compounds.<BR>

<P>
Mr. Hewitt suggested that staff report back to the Board in six
months on the issue of reclassifying PCBTF and VMS.<BR>

<P>
ON MOTION OF DR. WILSON, SECONDED BY MS. SOTO, A UNANIMOUS VOTE
WAS CAST BY THE BOARD MEMBERS PRESENT (Absent: Antonovich, Braude,
Burke, Lee and Silva), ADOPTING RESOLUTION NO. 95-33, AMENDING
RULE 102 AND CERTIFYING THE FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT, AS
RECOMMENDED BY STAFF; AND (2) DIRECTING STAFF TO REPORT BACK TO
THE BOARD IN SIX MONTHS ON THE ISSUE OF RECLASSIFYING PCBTF AND
VMS.<BR>

<P>
42. Amend Rule 431.1 - Sulfur Content of Gaseous Fuels<BR>

<P>
Mohsen Nazemi, SSC Senior Air Quality Engineering Manager, presented
the staff report. Mr. Nazemi added that representatives from Mobil
and Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts would be proposing
amendments to the rule, which are generally minor amendments and
are supported by staff. The public hearing was opened and the
Board heard testimony from the following individuals.<BR>

<P>
FRANK CAPONI, Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts (Submitted
Written Comments)
<P>
<U>LESTER SAKODA, Browning Ferris Industries <BR>
</U>
<P>
Expressed support, conditional upon the addition of the following
language to Subparagraph (d)(1) of PAR 431.1:<BR>

<P>
<U><I>Prior to the final compliance date specified for landfill
gas in Table I, a person burning landfill gas may comply with
the monitoring requirements specified in this paragraph, if data
regarding total sulfur content of the landfill gas is contained
and submitted to the District in a Rule 1150.1 plan.<BR>
</I></U>
<P>
PATRICIA JACOBS, City of Los Angeles
<P>
<U>VLADAMIR KOGAN, Orange County Sanitation District<BR>

<P>
Expressed support of the staff recommendation.<BR>

<P>
STAN HOLM, Mobil Oil Corporation (Submitted Written Comments)
<P>
<U>CHARLES AARNI, Chevron USA Products Company <BR>
</U>
<P>
Supported the staff recommendation, except for proposed amended
Subparagraph (g)(10) because of equity considerations between
Mobil and Chevron--the only two refiners impacted by that provision.
In order to resolve the equity issue, Mobil and Chevron reached
an agreement to sunset that provision; and recommended that Subparagraph
(g)(10) be amended by the Board to sunset on November 17, 1997.

<P>
8. Approve the Fiscal Year 1995-97 AB 2766 Discretionary Work
Program and Authorize the Board Chairman to Execute Agreements
for Fiscal Year 1995-96 AB 2766 Discretionary Fund<BR>

<P>
Eric Haley, Chairman Emeritus of MSRC's Technical Advisory Committee/Alternate
MSRC member, addressed the Board to respond to questions by Ms.
Lee as to how the MSRC decides the amount to be allocated for
each of the three categories, and how much of the $3 million mentioned
in the Board letter is used for administrative costs. Mr. Haley
clarified that the $3 million referred to is reserved for future
projects only and is not used to cover administrative costs at
all.<BR>

<P>
In response to Ms. Lee's first question, Mr. Paulitz, the Board's
representative on the MSRC, explained that the allocations are
based on what the MSRC has learned from the previous year as to
what types of projects have been successful or not and what types
of projects are in need. That program is then refined as proposals
are submitted. Mayor John Longville, MSRC Chair, added that when
the work program is designed there are broad categories, and narrow
categories within the broad categories. The amount of money that
is set aside for the broad categories is held firm, and then allocations
are shifted within the narrow categories if one category does
not attract, a desirable number of proposals.<BR>

<P>
15. Establish List of Pre-Qualified Vendors to Provide Compressed
Gases and Cryogenics<BR>

<P>
Ms. Lee expressed concern that none of the eight vendors listed
are minority, woman or disabled veteran business enterprises (MBE/WBE/DVBE);
and asked staff whether or not subcontractors, if any, would be
required to be MBE/WBE/DVBE-qualified.<BR>

<P>
William Fray, Director of Applied Science &amp; Technology, responded
that all of the eight companies listed are major, publicly-traded
corporations, and therefore not MBE/WBE/DVBE-qualified. Staff
was not sure if it was possible to extract commitments from publicly-traded
corporations with respect to minority subcontracting for this
types of purchase; but if so, staff will pursue such a commitment.
<BR>

<P>
With respect to the advertisement of the RFP in <I>La Opinion</I>
newspaper, Ms. Soto pointed out that <I>La Opinion</I> is not
read widely by people who are mostly-conversant in English. She
suggested that it would be more productive if staff advertised
in English language newspapers, which is most likely what people
interested in these types of business opportunities would be reading.
<BR>

<P>
Expressing his concern that staff was not aware that publicly-traded
companies could be required to subcontract with MBE/WBE/DVBE-qualified
businesses, Dr. Burke commented that the MTA is issuing $50 million
worth of contracts each week, and they know that subcontractors
of any corporation can be required to fulfill a quota. While he
is not a product, nor a great advocate, of affirmative action;
he believed that if AQMD is going to administer under affirmative
action, it should do so appropriately. He stated that he would
vote against this item, and any other contract that is not handled
properly as long as he is on the Board.<BR>

<P>
Chairman Mikels directed staff to take the appropriate actions
to address the concerns expressed by Ms. Lee, Ms. Soto and Dr.
Burke.<BR>

<P>
Mr. Silva and Ms. Lee, who were not present at the November 17,
1995 Board meeting, indicated that they had reviewed the tape
recordings of the public hearing on this item held at that meeting,
as well as the related written materials.<BR>

<P>
Pat Leyden, DEO of Stationary Source Compliance, summarized the
issues raised at the November 17 public hearing that were continued
to the December 7 Board meeting, and presented staff's responses
to those issues and recommendations for Board action. At Ms. Soto's
request, staff agreed to include in the Resolution for this item
that once the new guidance document is promulgated by EPA, the
Home Rule Working Group will review the document for any opportunities
that may exist for additional flexibility and modifications to
NSR.<BR>

<P>
In response to Ms. Haggard's comment that she was still concerned
that the offset requirements would discourage new businesses from
locating to this region, Ms. Leyden clarified the state and federal
laws with respect to requirements for offsetting emission increases
from permitted sources.<BR>

<P>
Mr. Silva indicated that the hearing should be continued to the
March 8, 1996 Board meeting since staff was recommending that
the majority of the proposed amendments be continued to that date.
Also, EPA is expected to have new NSR language by that time. 
<BR>

<P>
MR. SILVA MOVED TO CONTINUE THE PUBLIC HEARING TO AMEND REGULATION
XIII AND RULE 212 TO THE MARCH 8, 1996 BOARD MEETING.<BR>

<P>
Ms. Leyden responded that the forgiveness of NSR debt is an important
benefit in <BR>
PAR XIII. There are additional flexibility opportunities in the
rule and expansion of exemptions. Staff urged the Board to adopt
the staff proposal, and continue to March 8, 1996 those items
noted by staff. As requested by Ms. Soto, if the new guidance
document from EPA offers more flexibility than what is in PAR
XIII, staff will bring those items back to the Board for consideration.
However, staff believes EPA's guidance will mimic the flexibility
contained in the staff proposal.<BR>

30. Adopt Proposed Rule 2100 - Registration of Portable Equipment
<BR>

<P>
Larry Bowen, SSC Senior Air Quality Engineering Manager, presented
the staff report. The public hearing was opened, and the Board
heard testimony from the following individuals:<BR>

<UL>
<LI>Speaking in support of PR 2100: 
</UL>

<P>
JEB STUART, Construction Industry Air Quality Coalition
<P>
FRANK DRYDEN, Southern California Alliance of POTWs (SCAP)
<P>
LEE WALLACE, The Gas Company
<P>
<U>ROBERT SHEPHERD, Shepherd Machinery Company and Power Systems
Associates<BR>
</U>
<P>
Mr. Dryden expressed concern that there is no guarantee that the
state rule which will supersede PR 2100 in August of 1997 will
contain the same provisions as PR 2100, particularly with respect
to the definition of location. Failure of the state rule to incorporate
that definition would make the rule untenable for many POTWs.
Therefore they would be reluctant to take advantage of Rule 2100
since they might in the future have to switch back to permitting
the equipment under Regulation XIII NSR requirements. Also, the
100 lbs/day project limit in <BR>
PR 2100 would mean increased construction time and, consequently,
increased costs; without benefiting air pollution.<BR>

<P>
He recommended that AQMD staff aggressively pursue having the
Rule 2100 definition of &quot;location&quot; incorporated into
the state rule. Interested industry representatives should be
included in such negotiations. Second, a provision must be added
to the AQMD's fee structure such that fees for re-filing under
NSR will be waived if the equipment that is being registered under
<BR>
Rule 2100 has to be transferred back to NSR because the state
fails to adopt an appropriate definition of location. In order
to make the use of portable equipment practical, the 100 lbs/day
limit should be applied to each piece of portable equipment actually
working on a project, rather than the entire project.<BR>

<P>
Concerns expressed were that the CAPCOA Model Rule was voted on
by all the APC Officers as a consistent statewide means of dealing
with the portable equipment issue. AQMD and a number of other
districts have chosen to drastically change the intention of the
CAPCOA rule to fit individual air districts needs. The problem
is, portable equipment is unique and has to be dealt with differently
than stationary sources with respect to BACT. The Board was encouraged
not to adopt PR 2100, but to direct staff to work with ARB and
industry to implement a consistent statewide regulation through
the AB 531 Task Force process.<BR>

<P>
There being no further testimony, the public hearing was closed.

Mike Justice, Justice &amp; Associates
<P>
James Thomas, Pool California Energy Services, Inc.<BR>

<P>
Jack Broadbent, Assistant DEO of SSC, responded that PR 2100 is
a voluntary program, developed at the request of industry. Its
adoption would allow equipment to be transferred back and forth
between different air districts that have adopted similar programs,
and it will serve as an interim measure until the state program
is implemented. With respect to the oil industry's concerns, BACT
requirements were placed in PR 2100 because of the air quality
need in this region. The 100 lbs/day limit was put in place to
protect short term air quality standards, particularly the NO<SUB>2</SUB>
standard. Staff believes the program is worthwhile because it
will serve as a stop gap measure until the program at the state
level is implemented. Although ARB's program is scheduled for
adoption in Summer of 1996, there is no real assurance that the
program will be enacted at that time.<BR>

<P>
With respect to recommendation that AQMD staff pursue incorporation
of the PR 2100 definition of location in the state program, staff
plans to participate and serve on the committee at the state level
and will work with ARB to pursue that definition. In terms of
the fee request for re-filing under NSR, staff will examine that
as part of the Rule 301 fee amendments that will be before the
Board in May or June 1996.<BR>

34. Adopt Proposed Rule 118 - Emergencies<BR>

<P>
Cindy Greenwald, PTIM Planning &amp; Rules Manager, presented
the staff report. The public hearing was opened, and the Board
heard testimony from the following individuals:<BR>

<P>
<U>VINCENT GONZALES, ARCO<BR>
</U>
<P>
Expressed support of PR 118; but recommended that the rule not
be limited to equipment used for emergency purposes, because demands
for equipment that is not normally used for emergency purposes
can be increased during times of emergencies. (Submitted Written
Comments.)<BR>

<P>
<U>GREG ADAMS, Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts/IAIC Technical
Advisory Committee<BR>
</U>
<P>
Expressed support of PR 118, and requested that the declarations
of emergency be expanded to other than the governor and federal
government to perhaps an authorized county health officer.<BR>

<P>
There being no further testimony, the public hearing was closed.
<BR>

<P>
Ms. Greenwald responded that PR 118 would allow for suspension
of permit conditions which limit throughput if the action was
necessary to protect health or safety, and was not limited to
emergency equipment. With respect to the issue of local emergencies,
PR 118 was developed to address widespread emergencies where there
was need for a great number of variances or a need to bring in
equipment from outside the district because the four-county region,
with its permitted equipment, could not service that area. For
localized emergencies, there is permitted equipment within the
basin which can fill that need and there would not be so great
a number of variances that the Hearing Board would be overwhelmed.
Staff believes the existing system is capable of handling those
localized variances.<BR>

35. Amend Regulation XX - Regional Clean Air Incentive Market
(RECLAIM)<BR>

<P>
William Thompson, SSC Senior Manager, presented the staff report.
Because of concerns expressed by industry and new updated information
on the increase of CO emissions from the use of tire-derived fuel,
it was necessary that the CEQA document for cement kilns be recirculated
in order to evaluate the impacts of this potential increase. Also
the provisions of Regulation XX dealing with FLM and visibility
issues had been delayed to streamline the process. Both items
will be brought back to the Board at its March 8, 1996 meeting.
In addition, the metal melting industry raised concerns regarding
preheated air furnaces, which staff needed to completely research.
Staff will bring that issue back to the Board in the Spring of
1996.<BR>

<P>
The public hearing was opened, and the Board heard testimony from
the following individuals:<BR>

<P>
<U>CURTIS COLEMAN, California Portland Cement Company<BR>
</U>
<P>

kiln issue.<BR>

<P>

<P>
<U>TOM DODSON, local ski resorts<BR>

question, with respect to the ski slope exemption, as to whether
or not the north slope of the mountains facing the desert are
in fact within AQMD's jurisdiction. (*Submitted Written Comments.)
<BR>

<P>
<U>RON WILKNISS, Western States Petroleum Association<BR>
</U>
<P>
Opposed the deletion of the provision in Rule 2006 (c)(5) for
a 30-day notification to the permit holder before the permit conditions
are amended.<BR>

<P>
<U>MICHAEL WEBSTER, Los Angeles Department of Water &amp; Power
<BR>
</U>
<P>
With respect to Rule 2012 Protocol, Appendix A, Attachment F (40),
which limits operation of peaking units to 200 hours per year,
expressed concern that these units may not be operated for several
years, but could exceed 200 hours during a year of high demand.
Requested the opportunity to discuss with staff adding language
to the rule to allow a two or three year averaging.<BR>

<P>
There being no further testimony, the public hearing was closed.
<BR>

<P>
Pang Mueller, SSC Senior Manager, responded that staff believed
it necessary to delete the 30-day notification requirement because
a number of RECLAIM facilities are subject to the federal Title
V programs as well, which set forth various notification requirements
that conflict with the 30-day requirement in Regulation XX. With
respect to the 200 hours/year limitation, staff was willing to
postpone that issue for further discussion with industry and bring
it back to the Board at a later date.<BR>

<P>
In addition to expressing support for the staff recommendation,
the following suggestions/comments were made:<BR>

<UL>
<LI>Suggest: Put the wording on the transitional period for the
filing dates and the three-year extension into the rule itself
rather than in the staff report. Also, suggest the addition of
a definition of &quot;Emission Reduction Program&quot; that is
used throughout the rule. 
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>Three points were emphasized: (i) The 1994 AQMP and the California
SIP depended upon ridesharing for the conformity finding; (ii)
The rule does not transfer any additional burden to stationary
sources; and (iii) PR 2202 is important to remain in compliance
with the federal CAA. 
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>Request: That priority be given to Metrolink to receive a
share of the moneys collected through the AQIP. These moneys would
be used for the development and implementation of incentive programs
aimed at the employer market to encourage new ridership and retain
current riders. 
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>Comment: Significant progress is being made toward meeting
trip and VMT reduction goals and the ongoing cost effectiveness
evaluations are being used to modify these programs on an ongoing
basis so that improvements can be made. 
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>Concern: The definitions under the employee commute reduction
option of PR 2202 place facilities that operate 24 hours/day,
7 days/week and that have implemented compressed work week programs
to comply with ridesharing rule requirements at a disadvantage.
Recommendation: The following amendments to the definitions of
AVR Window and Compressed Work Week: 
</UL>

<P>
<I>&quot;AVR WINDOW is the period of time, Monday through Friday
between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m. used to calculate
AVR in accordance with these guidelines. <U>AVR Window, as applies
for businesses operating 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, is the
period of time, Sunday through Saturday between the hours of 6:00
a.m. and 10:00 a.m., used to calculate AVR in accordance with
these guidelines. A business operating a work week other than
Monday through Friday must notify the District to change the AVR
window for its annual survey and AVR calculation</U>.&quot;<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>&quot;COMPRESSED WORK WEEK .... when all days worked and all
earned days off fall within the AVR survey week<U>, except in
cases where businesses operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
In those cases, compressed work week credit will be granted when
an employee completes the required work days and scheduled days
off within a 7 day period</U>.&quot;<BR>
</I>
<UL>
<LI>Recommendation: Continuation of voluntary rideshare programs
and continuation of employer-based public transit subsidies. 
<BR>

Senator Rob Hurtt, the author of Senate Bill 772, which eliminates
mandatory trip reduction plans, expressed his belief that PR 2202
would circumvent SB 772 and SB 437. It was his belief that most
of the options presented in PR 2202 are unacceptable to most of
the business and employer community and the majority of employers
will be forced to continue with the trip reduction plan mandate.
Proposed Rule 2202 is very similar to Regulation XV and, in his
opinion, may be even more onerous. He urged total elimination
of Rules 1501 and 1501.1 and the adoption of a new rule as part
of the AQMP planning process with more effective mobile source
emission reduction strategies which will not unnecessarily burden
the employer community<BR>

<P>
In addition, the following comments/concerns were expressed by
the other speakers listed above:<BR>

<UL>
<LI>For most employers, PR 2202 leaves only two choices: either
a strategy based on employee trip reduction, or a strategy based
on old vehicle scrapping. The other options allowed to employers
are impractical. 
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>PR 2202 places an unfair burden on businesses, which are already
mandated to clean up their own emissions. 
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>It is offensive to assume, in the face of the passage of state
legislation and pending federal action, that a replacement rule
for Regulation XV should be employer-based. The proposed rule
was hastily drafted without benefit of socioeconomic or business
impacts and without consideration of other alternatives which
could lead to more effective solutions. 
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>Rather than PR 2202, the Board needs to adopt a program, on
an aggressive timetable, that would shift the focus and burden
from an employer-based approach to a regional approach, involving
more innovative, market-oriented solutions. 
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>Urge the Board, if it decides to adopt PR 2202, to include
the amendments proposed by COALESCE. <BR>

The following individuals did not express a specific position
on the staff recommendation, but expressed the following concerns
and/or comments:<BR>

<P>
<U>JOHN OWYANG, Market-Based Solutions and Old Vehicle Clearinghouse
<BR>
</U>
<P>
Urged the Board to act decisively. Establish who should be responsible
for reducing the emissions, and then determine the most cost effective
way of achieving those reductions. The Board should not say that
PR 2202 will sunset in three years if it does not truly believe
that will happen because it makes it difficult for businesses
to plan ahead. Also, if the Board does not truly feel that equivalent
emission reductions can be achieved at the AQIP fee levels established,
the Board should direct staff to determine the appropriate level
where the market will establish. The business community does not
want the Board to set the fee at a low level now, only to be increased
in several months.<BR>

<P>
<U>RENZO VENTURO, Hughes Electronics<BR>
</U>
<P>
Expressed concern that the AQMD is not pressing the issue that
the Inspection and Maintenance Program and the federal standards
on engines are where the emissions reductions need to come from
and should be allocated.<BR>

<P>
<U>STAN SHAW, Clean Air Fuels<BR>
</U>
<P>
Commented on a biodegradeable, alcohol-based product he has developed
which, when added to gasoline, can increase vehicle mileage by
20 to 30 percent, as well as reduce hydrocarbons by 70 percent,
CO by 60 - 80 percent, and NOx by 50 -60 percent.<BR>

<P>
<U>ALAN TRUDELL, Garden Grove Unified School District<BR>
</U>
<P>
Requested that those school districts that effectively shut down
during the summer be relieved of burdensome documentation and
AVR requirements.<BR>

<P>
<U>CURTIS COLEMAN, CMA Southern California Air Quality Alliance
<BR>
</U>
<P>
1) Supported rescinding Rules 1501 and 1501.1 and replacing those
rules with more effective programs directed at the causes of emissions
rather than at employers. 2) Expressed concern that the PR 2202
will likely be in place longer than the three-year phaseout period
during which other emission reduction programs are to be developed.
3) Recommended that inclusion of RTCs as a compliance option in
Rule 2202 should be considered along with NSR, RECLAIM and MSERCs
in a comprehensive manner, rather than dealing with each on an
&quot;ad hoc&quot; rule-by-rule basis.<BR>

<P>
<U>GREG ADAMS, Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts<BR>

Suggested that whatever findings result from the Intercredit Study
scheduled for February 1996, those findings should be incorporated

Dr. Wallerstein noted that during public testimony staff prepared
and distributed to Board members a written response to the COALESCE
proposal. Staff believed a number of issues in the COALESCE proposal
would be appropriately addressed in the Intercredit Study, and
during the next six weeks staff will complete the technical analysis,
CEQA analysis, and make sure that all parties that would be affected
are afforded the opportunity to offer their views on a number
of the items.<BR>

<P>
The first item proposed by COALESCE involved the use of existing
ERCs and RTCs. These are specific items that are being addressed
in the Intercredit Trading Study, where staff believes a comprehensive
policy is needed. Therefore, staff recommended the Board adopt
the original language as proposed by staff. The second request
by COALESCE was to open up the option list to include a generic
provision that would allow the Executive Officer the latitude
to approve strategies that achieve surplus emission reductions
under federal and state law. Staff was agreeable to including
that provision, with the clarification that in addition to surplus,
the emission reductions are also &quot;<U><I>real</I></U><I>&quot;</I>
and &quot;<U><I>enforceable</I></U><I>&quot;</I>. However, staff
believed the addition of the following sentence at the end of
the paragraph was necessary, to assure that whatever is granted
through this generic option is consistent with the Board's guidance
and policies:<BR>

<P>
<U><I>&quot;The Executive Officer shall not approve an alternative
emission reduction program unless it is consistent with other
District regulations and Governing Board policies, and shall consider
guidelines established by the ARB and EPA.&quot;<BR>
</I></U>
<P>
Staff suggested modifying COALESCE's proposed subparagraph (m)(1)
as follows to reflect ARB guidance in the appropriate technical
data:<BR>

<P>
<I>(1) an employer or other person seeking credit under this rule
may use </I><STRIKE><I>15,000 annual miles</I></STRIKE><U><I>
actual annual mileage</I></U><I> per vehicle, or alternative estimates
of vehicle miles traveled (VMT</I><STRIKE><I>), if it cannot reasonably
estimate VMT</I></STRIKE><I> <U>contained in Rule 2202 implementation
guidelines adopted (date of adoption</U>).<BR>
</I>
<P>
COALESCE's proposed subparagraph (m)(2) relates to interpollutant
trading and could potentially cause problems in terms of demonstrating
emissions equivalency. For that reason, staff recommended deleting
(a) and (b) of that section. However, to provide additional flexibility
and, if the opportunity exists, to use the AQIP to help incentivize
and commercialize technologies that otherwise might not have as
strong a place in the selection process, staff suggested addition
of the following language at the end of the subparagraph (m)(2):
<BR>

<P>
<I>(2) emission credit strategies that do not provide the precise
amount of surplus emission reductions for each of the three pollutants
addressed by this rule (VOC, NOx, CO) may still qualify for equivalent
credit<U> if the employer provides equivalent credits obtained
pursuant to paragraph (m)(3) or the District achieves equivalent
reductions through the AQIP</U>.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
</I>
<P>
Staff suggested the following correction to COALESCE's proposed
subparagraph (m)(3) to make sure to stay within the scope of the
CEQA analysis; but staff would be willing to consider the additional
language in the future as a potential rule amendment:<BR>

<P>
<I>(3) any person holding surplus emission credits<U>, other than
vehicle trip emission credits,</U> under this rule may trade some
or all of those credits to other employers for their use;<BR>
</I>
<P>
Staff recommended deleting subparagraph (m)(4) of the COALESCE
proposal because it is an intercredit study issue, and staff needs
to complete the technical analysis that is underway prior to making
a formal recommendation.<BR>

<P>
Regarding the school districts exemption, staff agreed that the
issue deserves further attention, and intends to meet with the
Garden Grove School District and other appropriate parties to
further evaluate that issue.<BR>

<P>
With respect to the clean fuel issues raised, staff recommended
that be brought before the Technology Committee for review. Regarding
the request by Metrolink to seek AQIP funds, staff welcomed an
appropriate proposal from Metrolink through the RFP process.<BR>

THE MOTION WAS SECONDED BY MR. PAULITZ.<BR>

<P>
Mr. Antonovich commented that exempting county law enforcement
agencies and medical facilities that operate 24 hours/day from
AVR requirements or allowing those facilities more leeway in meeting
AVR requirements without having to pay fines, would result in
substantial savings for limited county resources. He also asked
if staff could report back to the Board regarding the biodegradeable
fuel additive mentioned during the public hearing.<BR>

<P>
Dr. Wallerstein recommended that staff quantify the impacts and
report back to the Board's Mobile Source Committee in terms of
the number of county law enforcement and medical facilities, and
what the overall impacts would be with respect to exempting or
allowing them leeway in meeting AVR requirements. Staff was agreeable
to reporting back to the Technology Committee on the biodegradeable
fuel additive mentioned.<BR>

<P>
In response to Mr. Loveridge, General Counsel Peter Greenwald
explained the existing state and federal laws concerning employer
ridesharing plans and sanctions for failure to comply with the
federal CAA. It was staff's opinion that neither SB 437, which
imposes limitations on the AQMD's authority to require employers
to implement trip reduction programs, nor SB 772, which prohibits
a mandate of trip reduction plans, would prohibit Regulation XV
or Rule 2202. The Manzullo Bill (HR 325), pending federal legislation,
would in staff's view authorize the withdrawal of the current
submission of Regulation XV as part of the SIP only if the state
has an alternative means of achieving emission reductions which
are equivalent to those that would be achieved by the SIP submission.
<BR>

<P>
In response to Ms. Soto, Dr. Wallerstein indicated staff's agreement
to include in the Resolution direction to staff to: (i) develop
streamlined implementation and reporting procedures as done with
the recent efficiencies and cost savings achieved by Regulation
XV; and (ii) provide guidance and help determine the cost effectiveness
of various options for employers and for different situations.
<BR>

<P>
Mr. Hewitt submitted for the record a memorandum which he distributed
to Board members explaining his opposition to PR 2202. In summary,
that PR 2202 should not be adopted; and were it to be adopted,
it should not be adopted in the face of pending federal legislation.
He concluded the memorandum by stating, in anticipation of Senator
Hurtt's comments, that if the Board passed PR 2202--even as amended,
and he intended to support amendments and ultimately vote against
adopting Rule 2202--the Board would not only invite the contempt
of the Legislature, but will have earned it; and he would work
with Senators Polanco, Hurtt and Lewis to draft legislation to
restructure the agency.<BR>

<P>
THE MOTION WAS SECONDED BY MS. HAGGARD.<BR>

<P>
Ms. Haggard expressed her belief that it would be appropriate
for the Mobile Source Committee to review the remote sensing and
intercredit/interpollutant issues. Dr. Wallerstein noted that
the Intercredit Trading Study was on the agenda for the next meeting
of the Mobile Source Committee, and indicated that he was agreeable
to appending to the Study staff's assessment of the rule language
proposed by COALESCE that staff is recommending the Board not
adopt at this time.<BR>

<P>
Speaking in support of the main motion and in opposition to the
amendment by <BR>
Mr. Hewitt, Mr. Braude commented that the Board, in response to
the public and the business community, had moved a long way from
the original adaptation of Regulation XV. In the interim, the
Board has adopted RECLAIM, perhaps the most revolutionary and
most significant action in the use of the market mechanism to
regulate air quality control in the history of this country. The
COALESCE amendment suggests mixing pollutants, which he believed
would jeopardize the advancement made with RECLAIM in setting
up a market mechanism to control air pollution.<BR>

<P>
Mr. Mikels added that he also opposed Mr. Hewitt's amendment,
for two reasons: (i) The COALESCE proposal basically says that
the Executive Officer should be able to approve any strategy,
whereas the language inserted into that by staff says the Executive
Officer shall not approve an alternative emission reduction program
unless it is consistent with Governing Board policies; and (ii)
The Intercredit Study will be reviewed by the Mobile Source Committee
and is scheduled for consideration by the full Board in February
1996. It seemed to him appropriate to wait until after the study
and deal with the issue comprehensively, rather than taking a
piece-meal approach.<BR>

<P>
Upon unanimous consent of the Board, Mr. Wyman addressed the Board
in response to comments and staff's modifications to the COALESCE
proposal. With respect to the interpollutant issue, he noted that
both EPA and ARB have already adopted provisions exactly as proposed
by COALESCE. Whatever small shortfall occurs can be made up with
the AQIP. The consequence of not allowing one of the two options
suggested by COALESCE would be no approval of remote sensing strategies.

for businesses operating 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, is the
period of time, Sunday through Saturday between the hours of 6:00
a.m. and 10:00 a.m., used to calculate AVR in accordance with
these guidelines. A business operating a work week other than
Monday through Friday must notify the District to change the AVR
window for its annual survey and AVR calculation.<BR>
</I></U>
<P>
<U><I><B>COMPRESSED WORK WEEK</B> applies to employees who as
an alternative to completing basic work requirements in five eight-hour
workdays in one week, or ten eight-hour workdays in two weeks,
are scheduled in a manner which reduces vehicle trips to the worksite.
The recognized compressed work week schedules for this Rule are
36 hours in 3 days (3/36), 40 hours in 4 days (4/40), or 80 hours
in 9 days (9/80). Compressed work week credit will only be granted
when all days worked and all earned days off fall within the AVR
survey week, except in cases where businesses operate 24 hours
a day, 7 days a week. In those cases, compressed work week credit
will be granted when an employee completes the required work days
and scheduled days off within a 7 day period.&quot;<BR>

<P>
THE MOTION WAS DULY SECONDED, AND PASSED BY THE FOLLOWING VOTE:
<BR>

<P>
AYES: Antonovich, Burke, Haggard, Hewitt, Lee, Loveridge, and
Silva.<BR>

<P>
NOES: Braude, Mikels, Paulitz, Soto and Wilson.<BR>

<P>
ABSENT: None.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
MR. HEWITT MOVED TO AMEND THE MAIN MOTION TO EXEMPT FROM RULE
2202 ALL PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOL DISTRICTS. THE MOTION WAS
SECONDED BY MR. SILVA.<BR>

<P>
Dr. Wallerstein responded that staff did not have the statistics
at hand to quantify the implications of the amendment in terms
of emissions. Catherine Wasikowski, Transportation Programs Director
added that pursuant to existing law, school districts do not pay
filing fees for trip reduction plans. The AQMD collects those
fees through the AB 2766 fund.<BR>

<P>
Mr. Greenwald recommended that this amendment be deferred to the
January 1996 Board meeting, so that staff can assess the emissions
impact and determine whether or not it is within the scope of
the CEQA document.<BR>

<P>
Ms. Lee asked that in the future, for any other rules, a separate
analysis be conducted to address the school districts issue.<BR>

<P>
MS. LEE MOVED TO AMEND THE MOTION BY MR. HEWITT BY DEFERRING THE
ISSUE OF EXEMPTING PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOL DISTRICTS FROM
RULE 2202 UNTIL STAFF HAS PERFORMED AN ANALYSIS OF THE IMPACTS
OF SUCH EXEMPTION AND REPORTS BACK TO THE BOARD WITH A RECOMMENDATION.
THE MOTION WAS SECONDED BY MR. BRAUDE.<BR>

<P>
Mr. Antonovich added that although exempt from trip reduction
plan filing fees, the schools are still subject to fines and have
to hire additional staff to prepare documentation. He believed
the money spent to pay their salaries could be better spent on
teaching supplies and materials.<BR>

<P>
THE MOTION BY MS. LEE TO AMEND THE MOTION BY MR. HEWITT BY DEFERRING
THE ISSUE OF EXEMPTING PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOL DISTRICTS
FROM RULE 2202 UNTIL STAFF HAS PERFORMED AN ANALYSIS OF THE IMPACTS
OF SUCH EXEMPTION AND REPORTS BACK TO THE BOARD WITH A RECOMMENDATION
PASSED BY THE FOLLOWING VOTE:<BR>

<P>
AYES: Braude, Burke, Lee, Loveridge, Mikels, Paulitz, Soto and
Wilson.<BR>

<P>
NOES: Antonovich, Haggard, Hewitt and Silva.<BR>

<P>
ABSENT: None.<BR>

<P>
Mr. Silva expressed his opposition to the main motion because
of his belief that PR 2202 would have a detrimental effect on
the health and welfare of the public. He believed employee ridesharing
would make economic sense if the incentives were in place, and
that the federal level might be the place to start, with income
tax credits.<BR>

<P>
Dr. Wilson clarified that the main motion does include the amended
language to allow expanding the CEQA interpretation for the flexibility
that the COALESCE amendments seek.<BR>

<P>
Ms. Haggard expressed her concern with comments that PR 2202 was
developed without consideration of other options. A tremendous
amount of time and energy has gone into this issue over the past
few months in an attempt to develop options that did not place
mandates on employers; and she wanted to dispel any image that
this issue has not received thoughtful consideration by Board
members. She strongly supported reconsideration of AQMD's entire
mobile strategy in the 1997 AQMP, as does the entire Board, with
an emphasis on voluntary programs that provide bankable, tradable
emissions credits. She asked for assurance that the Board has
appropriately directed staff to comprehensively re-examine the
mobile strategies in the 1997 AQMP, and to not take adoption of
Rule 2202 with its three-year sunset provision as meaning that
the Board wants the rule to be in effect that long.<BR>

<P>
Dr. Wallerstein responded that the last provision on the adopting
Resolution states: <I>&quot;The Board does hereby direct staff
to assess the necessity of developing and implementing the remaining
indirect source rules contained in the 1994 AQMP as part of the
1997 AQMP Revisions&quot;.</I> Staff was agreeable to modifying
that language to include <I>&quot;continued implementation of
Rule 2202&quot;.<BR>
</I>
<P>
Dr. Burke commented that while he had concern about the overall
effectiveness of Regulation XV, he could not responsibly vote
to repeal Regulation XV without there being a replacement rule
to achieve equivalent emission reductions.<BR>

<P>
Ms. Soto expressed her support for PR 2202 because it provides
alternatives and flexibility; and she believed the main thing
the cities she represent are impressed with is that PR 2202 gives
them a choice.<BR>

<P>
At Mr. Hewitt's request, Chairman Mikels directed staff to bring
back to the Board at its February 9, 1996 meeting a proposal,
appropriately noticed to the public along with all analyses and
CEQA documents, to amend Rule 2202 to exempt primary and secondary
schools and to allow the Board to consider adjusting the AQIP
fee.<BR>

<P>
Ms. Lee stated for the record that she had no objection to having
those two issues brought back in February, as long as those two
specific items are the only issues the Board will be taking action
on with respect to Rule 2202. Speaking in support of the main
motion, she commented that it is a universal acceptance that Regulation
XV does not work. On the other hand, many of the companies she
has spoken with have made great strides in participating in cleaning
up air quality. She has been an advocate on the Board of trying
to work out a balance where existing businesses are not driven
out and new businesses are not discouraged from locating to this
region, and yet the air quality does not get any worse. She believes
it a disservice to those who appoint members to the Board for
a Board member to try to dismantle the Board and the AQMD, and
did not appreciate hearing undercurrents of that being the result
if Board members do not agree on certain rules that the Board
promulgates.<BR>

<P>
Chairman Mikels commented that in recognition of the fact that
the direct measures in the SIP regarding mobile sources are insufficient,
state law gave the AQMD the authority to implement indirect source
rules. He believed AQMD has acted responsibly in trying to make
the proposed rule more flexible, reduce costs, and make it as
workable as possible. The idea of defeating Regulation XV and
not adopting PR 2202 seemed to him irresponsible and to commit
the AQMD on a risky endeavor that invites problems with transportation
conformity and a noncompliant AQMP, the consequences for which
at this time are incalculable.<BR>

<P>
PROPOSAL: Set Hearing to Consider Staff Recommendation and Rulemaking
Action Plan on Intercredit Trading--Increasing Flexibility for
AQMD's Mobile and Stationary Source Emissions Credit Programs
<P>
SYNOPSIS: In April 1995, the Board initiated the Intercredit Trading
Study. The objective of this study is to assess the feasibility
of linking the AQMD's mobile and stationary emissions credit trading
programs to increase compliance flexibility while achieving air
quality goals. In October 1995, AQMD staff released for public
review a draft paper on issues surrounding intercredit trading.
Four workshops were held in November. Based on public comments
received, staff is finalizing policy recommendations and an action
plan for rulemaking. Actual rulemaking would occur later. The
report will be made available prior to the February public hearing.
<P>
COMMITTEE: Mobile Source, December 15, 1995
<P>
RECOMMENDED ACTION:
<OL>
<LI>Set a Public Hearing February 9, 1996, to consider recommendations
and an action plan for the Intercredit Trading Study. 
</OL>

<HR>

<P>
<B>Background</B>
<P>
During the public hearing for Rule 1501.1 - Alternatives to Work
Trip Reduction Plans held in April 1995, members of the public
requested more open and flexible trading programs to provide additional
compliance flexibility. In response to these requests, the AQMD's
Governing Board directed staff to initiate an Intercredit Trading
Study to assess the applicability of intercredit trading within
the District's existing regulatory programs.
<P>
On October 13, 1995, the &quot;Concept Paper for Increased Compliance
Flexibility&quot; was presented to the Governing Board and released
to the public. This white paper outlined the AQMD staff's preliminary
policy positions on key issues surrounding intercredit trading
and was designed to initiate dialogue between the AQMD and the
public on these key issues. 
<P>
To seek public input, the AQMD staff conducted an extensive public
outreach by inviting over 10,000 companies and other interested
parties to participate in four public workshops held during November.
To provide interested parties an additional opportunity to comment
on this study, the public comment period has been extended from
December 1, 1995 to January 12, 1996. This will allow sources
affected by Rule 2202 and Regulation XVI that have expressed interest
in this study to provide written comments.
<P>
Staff recommendations and an action plan will be prepared incorporating
public comments and presented to the AQMD's Governing Board in
February 1996.
<P>
<B>Proposal</B>
<P>
Set a Public Hearing February 9, 1996, to consider staff recommendations
and an action plan for the Intercredit Trading Study. This study
assessed the seven key issues surrounding intercredit trading,
which included: Trading Interaction, Universe of Sources, Trading
Instrument, Discount Factor, Interseasonal Trading, Banking, and
Interpollutant Trading. These recommendations were developed with
public input received during workshops and through written comments.
The action plan will outline future activities, including possible
rule amendments or adoption, or both, to implement the proposed
recommendations.
<P>
<B>Policy Issues</B>
<P>
The following summarizes the seven key policy issues associated
with this study:
<OL>
<LI>Trading Interaction: How can intersource trading maximize
trading opportunities?
<LI>Universe of Sources - Credit Generation and Use: How can the
universe be expanded to maximize credit generation and use?
<LI>Trading Instrument: How can the trading instrument be standardized
to facilitate trading in a universal market?
<LI>Discount Factor: Should a discount factor be applied? If so,
when and where should it be applied?
<LI>Interseasonal Trading: Can incentives to shift VOC emissions
to non-ozone season accelerate achievement of air quality goals?
<LI>Banking: Can an emissions banking program provide additional
incentives to advance clean air technologies and be designed such
that Reasonable Further Progress and Attainment Demonstrations
are not compromised?
<LI>Interpollutant Trading: Should interpollutant trading, which
is allowed for PM10 and its precursors under NSR, be retained
or expanded to include other pollutants? <BR>

<FONT SIZE=4>PROPOSAL: Set Hearing to Amend Paragraph (f)(7) of
Rule 2202 - On-Road Motor Vehicle Mitigation Options Pertaining
to Fees for the Air Quality Investment Program<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>SYNOPSIS: At the December 1995 Board Hearing, the
Governing Board adopted Rule 2202 - On Road Motor Vehicle Mitigation
Options, and directed staff to bring back information for further
evaluation of appropriate fees for participation in the Air Quality
Investment Program (AQIP), and to consider possible exemption
of primary and secondary schools. A staff report is being prepared
on these issues and a February hearing is being scheduled relative
to the fees specified in Rule 2202. Any action to consider exemption
of schools would need to occur at a later date to allow completion
of necessary CEQA analysis.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>COMMITTEE: Mobile Source, December 15, 1995 - Based
on new information provided by staff, the Committee is recommending
that the Board proceed with the review of Rule 2202 fees, and
discussion of potential uses of the AQIP fund. However, the Committee
is not recommending exemption of schools from Rule 2202.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>RECOMMENDED ACTION:</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>1. Set a public hearing to receive further input
on AQIP fees and to consider adjustments, if appropriate.<BR>

<HR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>Background</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>At the time of adoption of Rule 2202 - On Road Motor
Vehicle Mitigation Options, the Governing Board directed staff
to perform additional analysis on the fees for participation in
the Air Quality Investment Program. Staff was also directed to
perform an analysis to determine what the implications would be
of exempting primary and secondary schools from Rule 2202, and
to bring forward recommendations at the earliest possible date.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>Proposal</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>The fees established in Rule 2202 were primarily
based on the implementation costs of old vehicle scrapping. The
current fee levels appear to be set at the lower end of the cost
range as established by free-market conditions. However, staff
is currently in the process of conducting a survey to further
document the current costs of car scrapping and will bring forward
any new information at the February 1996 Board meeting. The final
staff recommendation will be based on the results of this survey.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Additionally, a Request for Qualifications (RFQ)
will be released to establish a qualified scrappers list and to
gather information on estimated 1996 costs for vehicle scrapping.
This information will be brought to the Board by mid year. In
addition, a separate policy conference will be conducted on the
best use of AQIP funds. The conference is also tentatively scheduled
for February.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>At its December 15, 1995 meeting, the Mobile Source
Committee received preliminary information on the potential impact
of exempting schools from Rule 2202, as well as potentially available
compliance options specific to schools that would likely address
issues raised by schools. Staff will report on this item at the
February Board meeting, including updated information provided
to the Mobile Source Committee.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA)</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Relative to consideration of adjusting the Rule 2202
fees, the AQMD has reviewed the proposed project pursuant to California
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Guidelines Section 15002(k) -
Three Step Process, to determine which type of CEQA document to
prepare for the proposed action. The AQMD has determined that
any action relative to adjustment of fees is exempt from CEQA
pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Section 15061(b)(3) - Review for Exemption,
since the activity is covered by the general rule that CEQA applies
only to projects which have the potential for causing a significant
effect on the environment.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>In the event that the Governing Board decides not
to change the AQIP fees at this time, then there is no action
that would require a CEQA review and, therefore, a Notice of Exemption
would be unnecessary.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>As noted above, exemption of schools from Rule 2202
could cause potential environmental impacts that would require
preparation of an appropriate CEQA document. Such a document will
be prepared in the event that the Board wishes to proceed with
consideration of that limited exemption.<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>Background</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Due to the number, complexity and technical nature
of rules proposed for adoption or amendment during the upcoming
year, AQMD staff anticipates the need for assistance from outside
contractors in the preparation of all or portions of CEQA documents
for a number of rules. Similar needs for assistance are expected
for the preparation of CEQA documents for non-AQMD projects where
the AQMD is the Lead Agency pursuant to Title 14, California Code
of Regulations &#167;15051 or 15052, which governs CEQA lead agency
designation. At its October 13, 1995 meeting, the Governing Board
approved release of an RFP to secure assistance with environmental
analysis required by CEQA.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>Bid Evaluation </FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>The RFP was noticed and circulated according to the
AQMD's Consultant Selection Policy and Procedure. In addition,
the RFP was mailed directly to the AQMD's CEQA consultant mailing
list, which includes approximately 250 consultants. This mailing
specifically includes MBE, WBE, and DVBE certified consulting
firms. The District received 14 written proposals by the close
of bidding on November 14, 1995. A consultant selection panel
consisting of District CEQA Staff, District Counsel, and SCAG
Staff was formed to evaluate all of the submitted proposals according
to the following criteria: CEQA Experience (weighted 40 percent),
Air Quality Management Related Technical Expertise (weighted 30
percent), Government/Regulatory Experience (weighted 10 percent),
Organization/Technical Writing (weighted 10 percent), Recommendations
from Current or Past Clients (weighted 10 percent).<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Based on the information contained in their written
submittals, the evaluation panel recommends selection of three
top rated contractors to assist with the preparation of CEQA documentation
for AQMD projects. A comparison of proposal scores for those consultants
whose proposals met the minimum technical requirements is provided
in Table 1 of Attachment 1. Final scores, which includes Technical
score; cost score; credit for being a certified MBE, WBE, or DVBE
and/or using a certified MBE, WBE, or DVBE subcontractor; and
credit for being a local business enterprise, are shown in Table
2 of Attachment 1.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>It is recommended that the top three consultants
be selected to provide greater flexibility and assure that adequate
staffing will be available should multiple projects be required
to be completed in the same time frame. The consultants also exhibit
particular strengths in differing areas, thereby providing broader
expertise than a single consultant selection.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>Resource Impacts</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Contract Services for CEQA projects are to be paid
on a time and materials basis at a total cost not to exceed $150,000.
Funding for these contracts is contained in the Planning and Policy's
Professional and Special Services Account in the Fiscal Year 1995-96
Budget. There will be no additional staffing impacts from these
contracts. <BR>

PROPOSAL: Amend the Agreement for Employee Relations Litigation
and Negotiation Services
<P>
SYNOPSIS: This recommendation is to amend the Goldstein, Kennedy
&amp; Petito contract to add an amount not to exceed $200,000
to cover extraordinary litigation expenses involving ongoing lawsuits,
legal challenges relating to the June 30, 1994, layoffs and reductions
in classifications, and contract negotiation impasse resolution.
<P>
COMMITTEE: Administrative, December 15, 1995
<P>
RECOMMENDED ACTION
<P>
1. Authorize the Chairman to execute an amendment to the contract
with the law firm of Goldstein, Kennedy &amp; Petito adding an
amount not to exceed $200,000.

_____________________________________________________________________
<P>
<B>Background</B> 
<P>
On December 7, 1995, the Board approved amending the Goldstein,
Kennedy, &amp; Petito contract by an additional $64,667 to cover
legal expenses relating primarily to three ongoing lawsuits. This
action had no direct resource impact since the funds were available
in the District General Account for legal services. In the December
Board letter recommending this increase, it was noted that, based
on current expenditures of approximately $50,000 per month, staff
intended to come back to the Board in January, following the required
30-day public notification period of a proposed supplement to
the Fiscal Year 1995-96 budget, to recommend an additional increase
of $300,000 in the Goldstein, Kennedy &amp; Petito contract. Because
of a recent favorable court decision in a lawsuit being handled
by Goldstein, Kennedy &amp; Petito, costs are now estimated to
be somewhat less than previously anticipated, and the request
has been reduced to an amount not to exceed $200,000.
<P>
As noted in the December Board letter, the increase to the contract
is needed to cover extraordinary litigation activity relating
primarily to ongoing lawsuits, to legal challenges to the AQMD
relating to the June 30, 1994, layoffs and reductions in classification
that attempt to reverse these actions, to pending arbitration
hearings regarding layoffs and reductions, and to ongoing labor
negotiations with two unions, which are currently in mediation.
The costs of these actions have been high in part because of the
short time frames for the AQMD's legal counsel to file responses
and the need for aggressively litigating these matters to defend
the AQMD against very costly consequences. The AQMD's three-year
employee relations legal services contract reflected an expectation
that costs would likely be highest during the contract's first
year. Much of the costly counsel-intensive activity that has occurred
since the beginning of this fiscal year was unanticipated.
<P>
<B>Resource Impacts</B> 
<P>
Staff recommends $200,000 from the Undesignated Fund Balance be
appropriated to the District General Professional and Specialized
Services Account for the purpose of amending the contract with
the Goldstein, Kennedy &amp; Petito law firm by an amount not
to exceed $200,000 to cover extraordinary litigation expenses.
Since this litigation may not be concluded by the end of this
fiscal year, any amount that remains will be carried forward to
next fiscal year.

<FONT SIZE=4>PROPOSAL: Issue a Request for Proposals to Enhance
the Current RECLAIM NOx/SOx Central Station Computer System<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>SYNOPSIS: The District is seeking qualified bidders
to enhance the current RECLAIM NOx/SOx Central Station Computer
System. The existing RECLAIM NOx/SOx Central Station Computer
System receives emissions and compliance data in electronic and
paper format; performs rule compliance analysis; and allows District
staff to interact with the results of the analysis. The enhancements
will improve the electronic reporting, add new compliance analysis,
and provide tracking and assignment of compliance analysis results.
This system will help ensure enforceability of the NOx/SOx RECLAIM
Program by performing automated compliance analysis in a timely
manner.<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=4>Background</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>In March, 1993 the Board approved the development
of the Emission Reporting System (ERS) in support of the RECLAIM
program. The ERS provides for the electronic acquisition of emission
and compliance data from RECLAIM facilities. The development of
the ERS was the first stage in developing the systems necessary
to determine compliance with RECLAIM Rules 2011 and 2012. Two
projects were included in the District's FY 1993-94 budget to
continue the staged development of a NOx Central Station Computer
System and a SOx Central Station Computer System in support of
RECLAIM. In June of 1994 , the Board approved a contract for development
of the RECLAIM NOx/SOx Central Station. The RECLAIM NOx/SOx Central
Station performs automated rule compliance analysis on emission
and compliance data reported by RECLAIM facilities. The attached
Request for Proposals (RFP) will enhance the existing RECLAIM
NOx/SOx Central Station Computer System by increasing the emissions
and compliance data that is captured, and performing additional
compliance analysis.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>Proposal</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>The goal of this procurement is to enhance the RECLAIM
NOx/SOx Central Station Computer System which performs automated
compliance analysis on emissions from RECLAIM facilities in the
oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and oxides of sulfur (SOx) markets. The
existing RECLAIM NOx/SOx Central Station Computer System receives
emissions and compliance data in electronic and paper format;
performs rule compliance analysis; and allows District staff to
interact with the results of the analysis. The enhancements will
improve the electronic reporting, add new compliance analysis,
and provide tracking and assignment of compliance analysis results.
It is an integral part of the systems necessary to determine rule
compliance and to maintain emission inventories.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>A systems integrator will be selected through an
open-bidding process in accordance with the District's Consultant
Selection Policy and Procedure. The contract award will not exceed
$231,000. Funding is included in Information Management's Professional
and Special Services Account under the FY 1995-96 Budget.<BR>

<B>BUSINESS OUTREACH &amp; PUBLIC EDUCATION<BR>
</B>
<P>
During the month staff participated in the following activities,
programs and events:<BR>
<BR>

<P>
BUSINESS CLEAN AIR PARTNERSHIP - The Public Advisor's Office was
involved in the following activities involving the Business Clean
Air Partnership:<BR>

<P>
<U>Amnesty Expanded To Include 10-Ton Sources</U> - Public Advisor
worked closely with large industry to agree on language that allowed
10-ton sources to participate in the Amnesty program for most
of their small equipment. We achieved consensus and had industry
support for the revisions to Rule 310 that were adopted on November
13, 1995.<BR>

<P>
<U>Amnesty Outreach</U> - During November the Public Advisor's
Office mailed special notifications to 15,000 businesses announcing
the Amnesty program. The notices were specifically written for
each type of industry (SIC code) and included a list of typical
equipment each industry might have. These notifications, more
than any other outreach effort, resulted in hundreds of calls
from businesses requesting further information. Additional mailing
are scheduled through February. <BR>

<P>
REGULATION VII OUTREACH - The Public Advisor's Office recently
wrote letters to area child care referral centers about the proposed
changes in Regulation VII, emphasizing the effort to expand the
agency's notification procedure of unhealthful air quality forecasts
to include all educational facilities, including day care centers
and preschools. Staff has coordinated efforts with these referral
centers to schedule 10 meetings through Spring, 1996. An article
has been produced for publication in newsletters of several resource
and referral centers. Public education materials also have been
provided for the upcoming Health Awareness Week program to be
put on by the Pomona Unified School District in January.<BR>

<P>
ASTHMA AND ALLERGY FOUNDATION MOBILE TREATMENT UNIT - The District
is cosponsoring a mobile treatment unit offered by the Asthma
and Allergy Foundation that will provide asthma treatment, education
and information to low-income children at their school sites.
The service will be provided by physicians from the Los Angeles
County/USC Medical Center and nurses from the Los Angeles Unified
School District. AQMD publications will be distributed from the
vehicle to parents, teachers and students on health effects of
smog, how pollution levels are monitored and how to minimize exposure
to air pollution.<BR>

<P>
<U>Events<BR>
</U>
<P>
LOS ANGELES BUSINESS OUTLOOK CONFERENCE - November 29, 1995 at
the Biltmore Hotel in Downtown Los Angeles. AQMD was a cosponsor
of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce's 47th Annual Business
Outlook Conference. In return for the cosposorship, AQMD was mentioned
in all pre-conference press releases, announcements, conference
programs and other promotional materials, including the Chamber's
monthly newsletter that has a circulation of 45,000. The Public
Advisor's Office provided staffing, an information table and business
outreach materials for attendees.<BR>

<P>
BUSINESS FINANCING WORKSHOP - November 14, 1995, at Chino City
Hall. The Public Advisor's staff gave a presentation on AQMD's
business assistance programs and the District's new Amnesty program
to local businesses attending the workshop, sponsored by the Inland
Empire Small Business Development Center. Information and brochures
on the AQMD's Business Clean Air Partnership, Customer Bill of
Rights and other business assistance programs was also distributed.
<BR>

<P>
VISITING DIGNITARIES - The District was visited on November 9,
1995, by Henrik Sandberg, a Swedish attorney researching transportation
control programs in the United States; and on November 16 by a
delegation from the Korean Ministry of Environment interested
in compliance issues. <BR>

<FONT SIZE=4>PROPOSAL: Status Report on Lead Agency Projects and
Environmental Documents Received by the AQMD<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>SYNOPIS: This report provides for the Governing Board's
consideration a listing of California Environmental Quality Act
(CEQA) documents received by the South Coast Air Quality Management
District (AQMD) between October 4, 1995, and November 3, 1995,
and those projects for which the AQMD is acting as lead agency
pursuant to CEQA.<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>EIR and Document Log (Attachments A and B)</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=4>
- Each month, the AQMD receives numerous CEQA documents from other
public agencies on projects which could adversely affect air quality.
Listings of all documents received for review are contained in
Attachments A and B. Monthly listings which are shaded note those
CEQA documents for which the AQMD staff has or will prepare and
submit comments to the lead agency. A list of active projects
from previous months for which AQMD staff is continuing to evaluate
or prepare comments is included as Attachment B. A new column
has been added to Attachments A and B of this report in response
to Board member request. The column captioned &quot;contacts&quot;
identifies parties who have contacted the AQMD with concerns or
issues about the proposed project. A notation of 1 in the contact
column indicates the contact was supportive of the project noted.
A notation of 2 indicates the party was opposed or expressed concerns
about the project.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>In the past, AQMD staff routinely reviewed many of
these documents and commented upon the air quality analyses and
possible impacts on the air quality of the district. Due to staffing
constraints, the AQMD is no longer able to routinely comment on
all CEQA documents received. Publication of the Board-approved
<I>CEQA Air</I> Q<I>uality Handbook</I>, however, has provided
local governments and other public agencies with the necessary
information to prepare appropriate air quality analyses on projects
for which they act as lead agency. As resources permit, staff
evaluates and may prepare comments for projects that may have
significant adverse regional air quality impacts (e.g., special
event centers, landfills, etc.) and those projects for which a
lead or responsible agency has specifically requested AQMD review
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>AQMD Lead Agency Projects (Attachment C)</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=4>
- Pursuant to CEQA, the AQMD periodically acts as lead agency
on stationary source permit projects. Under CEQA the lead agency
is responsible for determining whether an Environmental Impact
Report (EIR) or a Negative Declaration is necessary for any proposal
considered to be a &quot;project&quot; as defined by CEQA. An
EIR is prepared when the AQMD as lead agency finds substantial
evidence that the proposed project may have a significant adverse
effect on the environment. A Negative Declaration may be prepared
if the AQMD determines that the proposed project will not generate
significant adverse environmental impacts. The Negative Declaration
is a written statement describing the reasons a proposed project
will not have a significant adverse effect on the environment
and, therefore, does not require the preparation of an EIR.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Attachment C to this report summarizes the active
projects for which the AQMD is lead agency and is currently preparing
or has prepared environmental documentation. As noted in Attachment
C, during November 1995, the AQMD continued working on CEQA documents
for two (2) active projects. A project at the Mobil Oil Refinery
in Torrance has recently been proposed for which the AQMD will
act as lead agency.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>To date in 1995, the AQMD, as lead agency, has prepared
or contracted for the preparation of and certified four (4) CEQA
documents.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=4>REPORT: Feasibility of Monthly Recordkeeping for
Flexographic, Gravure, Letterpress, and Lithographic Printing
Operations<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>SYNOPSIS: On September 8, 1995, the Board directed
staff to evaluate the feasibility of monthly recordkeeping for
Rule 1130 - Graphic Arts printing operations. This report indicates
that monthly recordkeeping may be viable for part of the industry
but some enforcement issues still need to be resolved. In addition,
it recommends that pursuit of monthly recordkeeping be postponed
until after the VOC RECLAIM recordkeeping protocols and requirements
are adopted. This report also identifies several simplified daily
recordkeeping procedures that may be used by segments of the printing
industry.<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>_____________________________________________________________________
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>On September 8, 1995, the Printing Industries of
California (PIC) requested the Board to have staff investigate
the feasibility of allowing monthly recordkeeping for flexographic,
gravure, letterpress, and lithographic printing operations. The
Board directed staff to conduct the necessary evaluation and report
back on January 12, 1996. On November 16, 1995, staff briefed
the Stationary Source Committee regarding their preliminary findings.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>The report concludes that pursuit of monthly recordkeeping
for small non-RECLAIM lithographic printers should be postponed
until after the VOC RECLAIM recordkeeping protocols and requirements
are adopted. Significant effort is being spent in developing simplified
and enforceable recordkeeping criteria for VOC RECLAIM and the
work completed under that program may be able to be used to streamline
recordkeeping for a few hundred permitted printers. In order to
accomplish this objective, a number of rule amendments will be
needed. Details are described in the staff report.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Currently, 750 printing facilities are permitted.
Most printers in the basin (circa 1,750 facilities) are very small
and are exempt from needing a permit under Rule 219.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>A simplified recordkeeping system, based on quarterly
reports, is under development for VOC RECLAIM. The following table
indicates the number and types of facilities proposed for this
system.<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>The staff report assesses the opportunities to use
a monthly recordkeeping system for those printers where &quot;supplied&quot;
materials have the same VOC content as the materials &quot;applied&quot;.
The viable use of monthly records to determine rule compliance
is based on whether the materials are mixed or thinned before
use. The next table summarizes the results of the analysis.<BR>

The Committee received outside counsel's legal opinion, with a
written opinion to follow. The Committee also requested a special
half-day Governing Board workshop in late January to review the
District's system of investing funds in order to develop a comprehensive
strategy; accordingly, staff was instructed to provide an objective
briefing paper, with cost impacts and <BR>
resulting recommendations;</FONT>
<LI><U><I><FONT SIZE=4>Timely Distribution of Governing Board
Agenda</FONT></I></U><FONT SIZE=4>. Staff gave a brief review
of the new electronic Board agenda tracking system which is expected
to help expedite internal review of agenda items. The Committee
asked that any agenda item not available for distribution at the
monthly Board Assistant Briefing be removed from the agenda and
deferred until the following month, unless the Chairman, in consultation
with the Executive Officer, agrees that the item may remain on
the agenda and be distributed in a supplemental Board package.
In addition, the Committee expressed interest in possibly increasing
the number of Board meetings when volume of material to be reviewed
indicates such additional meetings are warranted. Staff is to
return to the Committee with a tentative schedule recommendation.
The Committee also felt that agenda items which are pulled from
the Consent Calendar should be heard subsequent to the Public
Hearing items and before the Public Comment period. In addition,
at the January Administrative Committee meeting there will be
a special briefing on the Rulemaking Calendar;</FONT>

Rule 2202 and AQMD Position</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>As a result of the Board's adoption of Rule 2202
(On-Road Motor Vehicle Mitigation Options), staff reported that
Senators Lewis and Hurtt may introduce one or more bills to either:
1) repeal the AQMD's action; 2) remove the AQMD's authority to
impose employer-based regulations; or 3) restructure the AQMD
in some fashion (perhaps by placing its budget under the Governor's
authority). Staff recommended that the Board resume meetings with
legislators to clarify and explain the Board's decision. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Board Member Hugh Hewitt reported that he would be
meeting with Senator Hurtt and others on December 15. In the interim,
he suggested that AQMD keep in close contact with Senator Lewis'
and Senator Hurtt's offices, and that staff coordinate closely
with the Air Resources Board. Later in the meeting, Mr. Hewitt
also requested that staff send a memorandum to legislators about
the two unfinished issues regarding Rule 2202; namely, whether
school districts should be exempted from the program and/or from
the payment of fees.<BR>

Clean Air Act amendments proposed by Senator Lauch Faircloth (R-North
Carolina), staff noted that the U.S. EPA and Wilson administration
are reviewing the substantive effect of each change. Staff recommended
that AQMD take the same approach in 1996, since it appears that
the amendments to the Clean Air Act may be handled individually.

about other air quality proposals is still sketchy, but staff
expects amendments to the California Clean Air Act to dominate
the session. Industry is also concerned about emission trading
credits, and may pursue legislation to build on this year's lawmaking.
Staff also reported that the Western States Petroleum Association
is seeking funds to implement their scrappage bill (SB 501-Calderon),
which has been signed into law. WSPA does not plan to attack AB
2766 funds in 1996, but may do so in the future. This discussion
prompted a comment from Chairman Mikels, that in order to justify
AB 2766 funds, cost-effectiveness analyses must be performed on
funded projects. Ideally, he would like AB 2766 funds to offset
ISRs. Larry Rhinehart explained that ARB's report on the statewide
program includes cost-effectiveness ratings for some projects.
The MSRC has a separate cost-effectiveness study underway, with
Acurex, that should be completed shortly.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>In response to a question about the status of two-year
bills, staff indicated that it would bring updated analyses to
the Committee next month. Board Chairman Jon Mikels and Mr. Hugh
Hewitt suggested that the AQMD begin anew in 1996, and assume
no policy positions on two-year bills until they have been considered
by the Legislative Committee.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Board Member Hewitt asked who might chair the Assembly
Committees with jurisdiction over air quality next year. Staff
responded that no one knows for sure, but if the current Republican
vice-chairs move up, the new chairman of the Assembly Natural
Resources Committee will be Keith Oldberg (Victorville).<BR>
</FONT>

</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>The Air Resources Board held a hearing on its Zero-Emission
Vehicle mandate on December 14, 1995, at which Chairman Jon Mikels
testified. Board Member Hewitt inquired about the AQMD's role
in the debate and whether the AQMD intended to criticize ARB's
final decision in the media. Chairman Mikels and staff responded
that AQMD has long supported ZEVs due to their critical role in
the Air Quality Management Plan. In prior years, the AQMD pushed
ARB to require even higher ZEV penetration by 2010. In 1994 (the
last time the mandate was debated) the AQMD and ARB agreed on
the current 2%, 5%, 10% schedule, with an additional, less specific
mobile source control measure to make up the difference. Chairman
Mikels' testimony noted that ZEVs were the cornerstone of the
AQMP and that direct control measures are preferable to indirect
source controls--even if they need some fine-tuning during the
implementation process.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Board Member Hewitt noted that the trickle of Air
Quality Investment funds may soon turn from a trickle to a flood
given the adoption of Rule 2202. Accordingly, suggested that staff
convene a conference with affected parties to discuss how these
funds should be spent, and to collaborate with Mary Nichols (U.S.
EPA Assistant Administrator) on this effort.<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>1. Rule 2202 - On Road Motor Vehicle Mitigation</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Staff gave a presentation on Rule 2202 of actions
taken by the Governing Board at its December 8th meeting. Staff
highlighted (Attachment II) the proposed implementation plan,
remaining issues to resolve, and the Air Quality Investment Plan
(AQIP). As part of the implementation plan, staff will be sending
a special edition of the AQMD &quot;Advisor&quot; newsletter and
a letter to Chief Executive Officers and Employee Transportation
Coordinators (ETCs), highlighting the various options under the
Board approved Rule 2202. Staff will be holding informational
workshops (Attachment III) at the District and throughout the
Basin to brief individuals and respond to specific questions and
company situations. Boardmember Soto stated that local governments
may have different needs and staff may need to tailor letters
to accommodate specific audiences. Staff will fax draft letters
to the Mobile Source Committee boardmembers for review and comments.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Boardmember Loveridge asked staff what kind of questions
they are receiving from incoming callers. Staff responded by stating
that most of the inquiries were site specific and related to implementation.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>At the direction of the Board, staff was asked to
perform an analysis to determine what the implications would be
on air quality if primary and secondary schools were exempt from
Rule 2202. Staff is examining the effects by county, employee
and student population, Average Vehicle Ridership (AVR) status
and emissions reductions achieved thus far. Staff is estimating
a potential revenue loss of approximately $100,000. Committee
Chair Haggard asked staff if AB2766 funds offset the fees presently
not paid by school districts. District staff responded affirmatively.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Boardmember Lee asked staff if trips completed by
parents were being considered. Staff stated that parent trips
were being considered to determine if credit could be given for
those students who were using public transportation, thereby reducing
the number of trips a parent might take. Boardchairman Mikels
stated that approximately 27% of the students are participating
in public transportation. Primary and secondary schools might
consider replacing existing buses with alternative fuels buses
as a way to obtain emissions credit inexpensively. Boardchairman
Mikels asked staff if AQIP funds could be used to fund this type
of project. Staff responded affirmatively.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Boardmember Loveridge stated that there is no reason
to exempt schools from Rule 2202. Boardchairman Mikels stated
that if student trips are included as part of the calculation
to meet the AVR targets, schools may already be in compliance.
Boardmember Lee stated that there are a substantial number of
schools that are part of the baseline. Boardmember Lee stated
that she is reluctant to exempt schools from Rule 2202. Committee
Chair Haggard stated that if the AQMD is going to regulate any
source for Rule 2202, it should be schools because of the example
given to students. Boardmember Lee stated that the Burbank Unified
School District has already begun to educate students about vehicle
mitigation options before they begin to drive. A motion was made
by Boardmember Loveridge that the committee not exempt schools
from Rule 2202. Committee Chair Haggard seconded the motion and
the committee unanimously approved the motion.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Staff distributed (Attachment IV) an update on the
AQIP fee levels. Staff indicated that the annual and triennial
AQIP fee levels in Rule 2202 have been lowered by 45 and 62 percent,
respectively, compared to the AQIP fee level in Rule 1501.1; those
reductions were established based on the compliance cost of implementing
car scrapping. Staff also presented the results for the analysis
conducted to determine the appropriateness of the AQIP fee level
for Rule 2202. The analysis was based on hypothetical cost scenarios,
as well as on actual cost information obtained by surveying companies
currently offering car scrapping services. The results of the
analysis indicate that the AQIP fees in Rule 2202 were at the
lower end of the cost ranges established, and, therefore, appropriate
at this time. Staff indicated their commitment to continuously
monitor the car scrapping activities and appropriately adjust
the AQIP fees in the future to reflect the market conditions.
Committee Chair Haggard asked staff about employees who opted
into the one year option and the possibility of these employers
integrating into the three year option. Staff indicated that they
are looking into the issue and that an appropriate recommendation
will be made to the Mobile Source Committee as part of the future
AQIP funding recommendations.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Boardchairman Mikels inquired about the competitiveness
among vehicle scrappers. Staff indicated that as the program progresses,
competition will increase which may further reduce the cost of
offering car scrapping services. Staff indicated that there are
sufficient vehicles in the Basin to scrap well into the year 2002.
There are currently four approved vehicle scrappers with several
interested parties filing applications. At the request of Boardmember
Hewitt, staff will be holding a conference on the &quot;best use
of AQIP funds.&quot; Staff will also periodically survey existing
scrappers to assess market conditions and determine if a fee adjustment
to the AQIP is necessary.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Ron Mertz of ECO Scrap stated that his company will
experience a financial loss during the first year if the cost
to scrap vehicles is lowered. Dr. Paul Boyce of Commuter Services
Group stated that his company would be forced to stop offering
the car scrapping service if the fees are further lowered. Boardmember
Loveridge asked the two scrappers what their fee threshold was
to maintain their business. Dr. Boyce responded with an estimate
of $900 - $950 per vehicle.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Boardmember Soto expressed her concern that those
individuals who scrap vehicles may be lower-income individuals
who need to sell their vehicles to obtain basic needs. Boardmember
Soto stated that individuals should be given more money than the
current rate in order to be compensated for the replacement of
their vehicle.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>2. Status Report on REACH Task Force </FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Staff gave an overview on the issues discussed at
the December 6th REACH Task Force meeting. The attitude surveys
are near completion. Staff stated that an additional $260,000
has been added to the original contract amount to facilitate a
fourth survey. This survey will be utilized to determine voter
acceptability regarding revenue spending.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>The Task Force has three issues to resolve to complete
the network-based analysis on alternative pricing rates. They
are: 1) How is the region defined? 2) Will VMT outside of the
region be exempted from fees; and 3) Will vehicles driven within
the region that are registered outside of the region be included
in the fee structure?<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>3. Update on Intercredit Trading Study</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Staff distributed (Attachment V) a summary of issues
and options. Staff has extended the public comment period to January
12, 1996 and will be presenting the study results with recommendations
and an action plan to the Board in February. John Billheimer asked
if there was a ranking or factor being considered for the different
pollutants. Staff stated that they are primarily concentrating
on NOx. Staff is also closely monitoring the national policies
on how ERCs and NSR will be used.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>The remaining items on the agenda were carried over
to the next meeting scheduled in January. To formally discuss
the Intercredit Trading Study results, staff will also schedule
a Planning Committee meeting in January and notify Boardmembers
from both the Planning and Mobile Source Committees.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=4>1a. Opening Comments:  Dr. Hazelwood briefly commented
on the Council's need to discuss Dr. Alan Lloyd's pending departure,
as well as the probable need to reschedule the December 28 Advisory
Council meeting.  Dr. James Lents then took the opportunity to
address the Council regarding Dr. Lloyd's departure, advising
that, due in part to the District's declining fee-based revenue(s)
and the resulting hiring freeze, Dr. Lents would temporarily assume
the responsi-bilities of Acting Chief Scientist while an evaluation
of funding/staffing levels is ongoing.  Dr. Hazelwood responded
by indicating that the Advisory Council members would be happy
to support Dr. Lents on any technical matter or in proposals review
which may arise subsequent to Dr. Lloyd's departure.  Dr. Lents
noted his appreciation of that offer.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>2. The minutes of the September 28, 1995, Advisory
Council meeting were approved, as submitted.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>3. Dr. Hazelwood introduced the next item, &quot;Discussion
of the Draft Report on 'The AQMD Beyond 2000' White Paper,&quot;
led by Dr. Amy Walton.  Dr. Walton began with an overview of upcoming
national, local government, environmental, regulatory and business
trends which may have implications for the District in the future.
 Dr. Walton reported that she and her Sub-Committee colleagues
proposed that the White Paper cover four approaches to be examined
as follows:  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> Dr. Jane Hall reported on three categories of changing
economic parameters:  (1) Continuing growth in population, economic
activity and transportation demand (VMT growth); (2) Continuing
perception that air quality regulations are inconsistent with
robust economic development, necessitating that the District better
explain distributional impacts and incorporate these variables
earlier in the regulatory process; and, (3) Increasing ethnic
diversity with higher income and educational levels of the Basin's
ethnic minority groups than the national average, thus creating
different challenges than nationally on environmental and regulatory
issues.  Based on the foregoing categories of change, Dr. Hall
reported that she is breaking out the implications for what this
may mean in terms of regulatory emphasis, compliance activities,
and how this might change the set of skills and the required level
of flexibility in staff, as well as the possible regionalization
of the Basin as the nation and surrounding areas of the State
come into attainment.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> Dr. Walton reported on the area of regulations and
regulatory issues on behalf of Dr. Venkatram who was absent from
this meeting.  Dr. Walton commented on the following four issues:
 (1) Regulations are a moving target which require a flexible
approach; (2) The District may face new mandates and regulations
relative to air toxics, revised ambient standards, visibility,
multi-media regula-tions, regionalization and privatization; (3)
How will progress be evaluated in terms of measuring air quality
improvements and health benefits? and, (4) The impact on the District
of the removal of EPA's authority over the District/Basin.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> Dr. Steve Colome reported that he will cover the
area of technological changes in potential control technologies,
measurement or monitoring technologies, communications opportunities,
and trends in understanding the health implica-tions of air pollution
exposure, all of which may have implications for the District.
 Discussion followed relative to the need to address a changing
demographic, required stricter health standard(s) as a result,
and the future of relating health outcomes to the measures of
pollution control.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> Dr. Walton advised that the white paper also will
address other trends within the federal government, organizational
trends, and even trends among other air quality management districts
relative to the issue of making public agencies look more like
private organizations.  A number of experiments and studies are
being undertaken to this end; and, Dr. Walton specifically mentioned
the example of the U.S. Geological Survey agency's Arizona branch
downsizing and closure.  Dr. Walton emphasized that if an agency
waits too long to examine and address some of the foregoing long-range
issues, its choices in handling those issues are lost.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> Discussion followed regarding the need for every
organization to &quot;reinvent&quot; itself, i.e., thinking through
what the organization does and possibly redirecting its function
and goals.  However, Dr. Hazelwood commented that the White Paper
will not provide specific recommendations on how the District
should be reorganized; it will, rather, provide several scenarios
and recurring trends in regulatory issues and technology.  Board
Chairman Mikels and Dr. Lents noted their appreciation for the
briefing and the valuable work accomplished on the White Paper,
to date.  Dr. Hazelwood closed by advising that the Advisory Council
hopes to present the final White Paper to the Governing Board
at a joint breakfast gathering to be held the morning of the March
8, 1996, Board meeting, and by favorably noting the amount of
progress that had been made and the quality of the work under
discussion.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>4. Committee Reports:<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>For the Regional Planning and Economics Committee,
Carla Walecka reported on the progress of the REACH Market Incentives
Task Force, reviewing with the Advisory Council the consultant
team's examination of emission reductions due to different pricing
techniques, e.g., congestion pricing, employee parking pricing,
fuel tax increases, and a hybrid emission fee varied by VMT. 
Material reviewed by Ms. Walecka is attached to these minutes
as Exhibit &quot;A.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>For the Atmospheric Sciences Committee, Dr. William
Carter reported that he and Dr. Katy Wolf had both attended the
second meeting of the California Air Resources Board on Consumer
Products Reactivity Regulations; and, that Dr. Carter gave a presentation
on the uncertainties involved in attempting to imple-ment reactivity
into command-and-control regulations.  Dr. Carter noted that the
regulatory approach covered was very preliminary </FONT><STRIKE><FONT SIZE=4>and
was, thus, considered insulting to the process</FONT></STRIKE><FONT SIZE=4>.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Dr. Carter further reported on the status of the
VOC RECLAIM Steering Committee's work, noting modification(s)
to the recording scheme as a result of their pilot study; these
modifications would also make the program less burdensome.  Dr.
Carter advised that he plans to bring his concerns relative to
the recording/database requirements to Dr. Lents and the District's
senior staff as part of their plan to schedule upcoming meetings
with interest groups key to the development of VOC RECLAIM.  Dr.
Katy Wolf also briefly reviewed the proposed District/EPA resolution
of equivalency with federal toxics regulations (NESHAPs), thus
impacting VOC/hazardous air pollutant content and reactivity issues.
 Discussion followed.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>For the Health/Risk Assessment (H/RA) Committee,
Dr. Russ Sherwin asked that Dr. Shankar Prasad meet with the H/RA
Committee to describe his role as Health Effects Officer.  Dr.
Prasad indicated that he would attend the H/RA Committee's next
meeting (December 7, 1995, at 2:30 p.m., in Conference Room CC-3/5).
 Dr. Sherwin further requested that Joe Cassmassi contact him
relative to the amended Regulation VII, with a possible follow-up
meeting among Mr. Cassmassi and the H/RA Committee members, if
needed.  Finally, a copy of the October 1995 article in the <I>American
Journal of Public Health</I>, &quot;Ambient Air Pollution and
Hospitalization for Congestive Heart Failure among Elderly People
in Seven Large U.S. Cities,&quot; is attached to these minutes
as Exhibit &quot;B.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>5. Other Business:<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> After consulting their respective calendars, the
Advisory Council members scheduled several future meetings as
follows:<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> December 7, 1995, at 3:30 p.m., in Conference Room
CC-2;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> January 25, 1996, at 3:30 p.m., in Conference Room
CC-8; and,<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> February 29, 1996, at 3:30 p.m., in Conference Room
CC-8.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> [A White Paper Sub-Committee meeting was subsequently
scheduled for November 30, 1995, at 3:30 p.m. in Conference Room
CC-8, at the request of Dr. Walton and the Sub-Committee members.]
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> Dr. Arthur Winer nominated Dr. Warren Blier, UCLA
Professor of Meteorology with expertise in modeling and trend
analysis, as a potential member of the Advisory Council and Atmospheric
Sciences Committee.  Dr. Hazelwood, therefore, requested Dr. Carter
to review Dr. Blier's resume and provide a recommendation on the
nomination.  Dr. Hazelwood mentioned that the Advisory Council
intends to go forward with the nomination of Dr. Katy Wolf; and,
requested further nominees in the fields of transportation and
health effects.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>6. There were no public comments.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>7. <I>There being no further business, the Advisory
Council meeting adjourned at 5:30 p.m.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=4>The Advisory Council, established in April 1977 through
Board resolution and since 1980 mandated under state law (Health
&amp; Safety Code 40428), is a technical advisory committee with
specialized expertise on issues impacting clean air. Its composition,
duties and activities are prescribed in Resolution 89-30 <I>(Attachment
1),</I> adopted by the Governing Board on July 7, 1989, which
sets its membership at a maximum of 20. Its organization consists
of three committees: Atmospheric Sciences Committee; Regional
Planning &amp; Economics Committee; and Health/Risk Assessment
Committee. <BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>During the last year three Advisory Council members
resigned because of job changes and residential relocations. Currently,
there are 9 vacancies and 11 members. In July 1995 the Governing
Board approved the re-appointment of the current 11 members for
another two-year term expiring July 31, 1997. The Advisory Council
recommends that the Governing Board appoint two individuals, Dr.
Kathleen Wolf and Dr. Warren Blier, to serve through the current
term expiring July 31, 1997. Dr. Wolf's and Dr. Blier's resumes
are provided as <I>Attachment 2 and 3,</I> respectively.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=4>Under the adopted Board resolution a $100 per diem
and roundtrip mileage (at $0.28 per mile) is paid to Advisory
Council members. These expenses are budgeted in FY 1995-96. Therefore,
this appointment would have no additional impact on the budget.

<FONT SIZE=4>REPORT: Feasibility of Using Rule 1130 - Graphic
Arts Compliant Inks in the Flexographic Printing of Polyethylene
and Polypropylene Bags<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>SYNOPSIS: On September 8, 1995, as part of the public
hearing on proposed amended Rule 1130 - Graphic Arts, the Board
directed staff to conduct a technology assessment on the flexographic
printing of polyethylene and polypropylene bags and report our
findings at the January 12, 1996, Board meeting. This report provides
staff findings on the feasibility of using compliant inks in the
flexographic printing of polyethylene and polypropylene bags for
tortillas, produce (carrots), frozen foods, pharmaceutical products,
and manure. It also provides staff recommendations for further
rulemaking.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=4>_____________________________________________________________________
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>In preparing this report, staff visited 21 facilities
printing the polyethylene and polypropylene bags in question.
Three of them are located in California but outside of the AQMD.
In addition, staff spoke with several printers located outside
of the AQMD to determine what ink systems and equipment they were
using, and to seven ink manufacturers to obtain information regarding
the compliant inks that are available for use. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>This report concludes that both ink and add-on control
technologies exist today that allow flexographic printers to comply
with the 300 gram per liter VOC limit in Rule 1130 for printing
the polyethylene and polypropylene bags in question . Compliant
ink technology is in use within and outside of the AQMD while
add-on control technology is currently only in use outside of
the AQMD. In addition, this report identifies VOC RECLAIM, once
adopted, as a viable option for flexographic printers to achieve
compliance with AQMD requirements. As a result, no change is proposed
for the existing VOC limit of 300 grams per liter. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Staff will continue to work with this industry to
assist printers in their efforts to achieve compliance.</FONT>

<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>Background<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>On October 15, 1993, AQMD Governing Board adopted
the RECLAIM program. The goal of the RECLAIM program is to provide
facilities with added flexibility in meeting emission reduction
requirements and lower the cost of compliance. The RECLAIM program
was designed to meet all state and federal requirements for clean
air programs as well as other performance criteria for air quality
improvement, enforcement, implementation cost, job impacts and
public health impacts.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Since RECLAIM is a significant departure from traditional
command-and-control regulations, the RECLAIM rules provide for
periodic program audits in order to verify that the RECLAIM objectives
are being met. Rule 2015 requires both annual audits focusing
on specific issues, and more comprehensive three-year audits.
The results of the audits will be used to determine whether any
program modifications are appropriate.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>The first annual RECLAIM program audit report has
been prepared by AQMD staff. The period covered by the audit includes
the first full year of implementation of the program for all RECLAIM
facilities. Pursuant to Rule 2015, the audit report is presented
for a public hearing, and will be included in the AQMD annual
performance report to the California legislature.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>Audit Findings<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>The audit findings indicate that the implementation
of RECLAIM during the first compliance year was highly successful.
The analysis indicates that:<BR>
</FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=4>RECLAIM is meeting its emission reduction goals.
Aggregate actual emissions from RECLAIM facilities were below
allocations for the first compliance year. If emissions and available
credits remain constant at current levels, a &quot;cross-over&quot;
point where the supply of RECLAIM Trading Credits (RTCs) equals
emission levels will be reached in the 1997-98 time frame for
NOx and the 1998-99 time frame for SOx. This excess of credits
in the early years of the program is consistent with the program
design.</FONT> 
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=4>An active trading market for RTCs has developed.
More than $10 million of trades have been registered in the NOx
and SOx markets combined, and sufficient RTCs are available to
meet the demand of RECLAIM facilities. Average NOx RTC prices
range from $26/ton for 1994 to about $1,500/ton for 2010. Average
SOx RTC prices range from $13/ton for 1994 to about $960/ton for
1996 through 1998. These prices are well below the backstop price
of $15,000/ton established in Rule 2015.</FONT> 
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=4>RECLAIM has not accelerated business closures.
Eleven RECLAIM facilities, equal to three percent of the RECLAIM
universe of 353 facilities, have gone out of business since the
program began, but RECLAIM was cited as a <BR>
contributing factor by only one of the eleven shutdown facilities.
Two new facilities started operations under RECLAIM, and three
existing facilities voluntarily joined the program. </FONT>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=4>RECLAIM has had a minimal impact on employment.
Total employment at RECLAIM facilities fell 7.2 percent from 165,713
jobs to 153,769 jobs during the first compliance year, for a total
of 11,944 jobs lost. RECLAIM was cited by facility operators as
the cause of 70 jobs lost, corresponding to a job loss of four-hundredths
of one percent due to RECLAIM. Two facilities attributed two jobs
gained to RECLAIM.</FONT> 
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=4>AQMD staff conducted a comprehensive compliance
program which included at least three visits to each facility
to assist with questions and confirm compliance. Eighty-six percent
of facilities complied with their allocations for the first compliance
year. Most instances of non-compliance with allocations were due
to a lack of familiarity with program requirements. Staff will
perform additional outreach efforts to ensure a better understanding
of rule requirements, and also take enforcement actions as appropriate.</FONT><I>
</I><FONT SIZE=4>Some facilities encountered delays in meeting
compliance deadlines for installing monitoring and reporting devices
such as Continuous Emissions Monitoring Systems (CEMS) and Remote
Terminal Units (RTUs). However, AQMD staff has worked with RECLAIM
participants to resolve specific concerns through rule amendments
and implementation guidance documents.</FONT> 
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=4>Staff has conducted an extensive public outreach
effort for RECLAIM participants which included workshops, training
seminars, open forums and other meetings, as well as written guidance
documents and informational mailings. This effort has been effective
in explaining and clarifying rule requirements and resolving facility
concerns in a timely manner.</FONT> 
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=4>RECLAIM continues to meet the requirement for
equivalency with the Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP). Allocation
levels have changed slightly since program adoption based on control
technology reviews and other new information. However, these changes
would also have occurred under command-and-control rules and therefore
do not affect the ability of RECLAIM to achieve reductions equivalent
to the AQMP as required by Health and Safety Code Section 39616.</FONT>

</UL>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>AQMD staff will continue to monitor and assess the
performance of the RECLAIM program and work closely with RECLAIM
participants to ensure continuing program success. <BR>

PROPOSAL: Public Hearing to Adopt Rule 518.2 - Federal Alternative
Operating Conditions.
<P>
SYNOPSIS: Proposed Rule 518.2 - Federal Alternative Operating
Conditions, establishes procedures by which owners/operators of
Title V facilities seeking a variance from AQMD or state rules
may obtain an Alternative Operating Condition (AOC) from the Hearing
Board that would be recognized by the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA). Five major issues are addressed in the proposed
rule: 1) federal recognition of variances through the approval
of this rule; 2) creation of a State Implementation Plan (SIP)
Allowance for variances; 3) content of AOC; 4) public participation;
and 5) mitigation of excess emissions.
<P>
RECOMMENDED ACTION:
<P>
1. Certify the Notice of Exemption for Proposed Rule 518.2 - Federal
Alternative Operating Conditions.
<P>
2. Adopt Rule 518.2 - Federal Alternative Operating Conditions.

<P>
<B>Background</B> 
<P>
The development of Proposed Rule 518.2 - Federal Alternative Operating
Conditions, commenced in June 1995. At that time the Governing
Board was considering the amendments to Regulation XXX - Title
V Permits, which addressed issues identified by EPA as necessary
to obtain interim program approval. A number of industry representatives
stated their concerns regarding the unavailability of federally
recognized variances as a basis for their opposition to the proposed
amendments to Regulation XXX, which was, therefore, continued
to August 11, 1995. Furthermore, the Governing Board directed
staff to convene the Title V Working Group and seek to resolve
the issue of federal recognition of variances and other issues
at the earliest opportunity. Amendments to Regulation XXX were
adopted by the Board on August 11, 1995. At that time, EPA, industry,
and the AQMD had conceptual agreement on an approach to resolving
the issue of federal recognition of variances. That approach is
implemented in Proposed Rule 518.2.
<P>
<B>Proposal</B> 
<P>
Traditionally, EPA has taken the position that a facility owner
or operator operating under the terms of a variance granted by
the local Hearing Board is not insulated from federal and citizen
enforcement actions except where such variance has been submitted
to EPA as a SIP revision. Proposed Rule 518.2 establishes AOCs
through a process that is almost identical to the existing variance
process, but since the rule itself will be in the SIP, and appropriate
public notice will occur, protection against federal and citizen
enforcement will be afforded. To accomplish this goal, the proposed
rule:
<UL>
<LI>requires that Title V facility owners/operators quantify excess
emissions resulting from equipment operating under a variance
and mitigate such emissions to the extent feasible;
<LI>establishes a SIP Allowance for excess emissions and ensures
that the aggregate excess emissions from all sources under federally-recognized
variances will not exceed the SIP Allowance for such emissions;
and
<LI>sets forth public participation and EPA review requirements
that are consistent with Regulation XXX.
</UL>

<P>
<B>Excess Emissions</B> 
<P>
Under existing state law and AQMD variance rules, facilities seeking
a variance must mitigate excess emissions to the extent feasible.
Proposed Rule 518.2 includes the same requirements and adds an
option for using Emission Reduction Credits (ERCs) if no on-site
mitigation is available, in the event that the SIP Allowance is
depleted.
<P>
<B>SIP Allowance</B> 
<P>
The SIP Allowance is intended to be sized to provide for reasonably
foreseeable needs of facilities, and to ensure that the AQMD's
attainment demonstration is not hindered. The proposal includes
both an annual and monthly limit for the SIP Allowance. Based
on the 1990 annual excess emission data, and 1992 through 1994
daily excess emission data, the annual and monthly SIP Allowances
shown in Table 1 are proposed. The SIP Allowances can be adjusted,
if necessary, during AQMP updates, and such adjustment will require
rule amendment.

</PRE>

<P>
<B>Public and EPA Review</B> 
<P>
Public and EPA notice (45 days) is required to satisfy Title V
permitting requirements, but this notice can occur either before
or after the variance hearing.
<P>
A facility owner or operator obtaining a variance pursuant to
the proposed rule will not have to undertake any additional permit
application, SIP revision or public notice procedures to obtain
protection from federal and citizen enforcement actions for covered
violations. The SIP Allowance is set at a level which, to the
extent feasible, is adequate to cover all reasonably foreseeable
needs of Title V facilities. If, however, the Allowance is exhausted
during a time period, AOCs which would allow further excess emissions
during that period will not be approved under the proposed rule.
Local variances will still be available in this unlikely event.
<P>
<B>AQMP &amp; Legal Mandates</B> 
<P>
The SIP Allowance is funded by designating a portion of the AQMP
emissions inventory for this purpose. It is anticipated that the
AQMP control strategies need not be altered by such funding because
excess emissions under variances are currently included in the
planning inventory, although they are not separately identified.
Additionally, through the creation of a SIP Allowance for excess
emissions, the proposed rule will ensure that aggregate excess
emissions from Title V sources under AOCs will not exceed a level
which would interfere with the region's plan for attainment of
the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).
<P>
<B>CEQA &amp; Socioeconomic Analysis</B> 
<P>
Staff has reviewed Proposed Rule 518.2 and determined that it
is exempt from the requirements of CEQA. The proposed rule is
administrative in nature and has no potential to impact the environment.
A Notice of Exemption has been prepared pursuant to state CEQA
Guidelines Section 15002 (k)(1) - Three Step Process [AQMD CEQA
Section 1.2 (k)(1)], and state CEQA Guidelines Section 15061 (b)(3)
[AQMD Section 5.1 (b)(3)]. The Notice of Exemption will be filed
with the county clerk immediately following the adoption of the
proposed amendments.
<P>
Staff has reviewed Proposed Rule 518.2 and determined that it
is not expected to impact the economy and employment negatively
as mentioned in the attached Socioeconomic report.
<P>
<B>Implementation Plan</B> 
<P>
Currently, the public obtains assistance about 1) how to request
a variance, 2) understanding the technical aspects of the rule
being violated, and 3) the variance process, through the AQMD's
Clerk of the Board Office, Hearing Board Liaison, and AQMD General
Counsel's Office. The variance proceedings under the proposed
rule and existing rules are similar, except that under the proposed
rule, AQMD will be required to track excess emissions and ensure
that the SIP Allowance is not exceeded. As such, Title V owners/operators
will continue to obtain assistance from these offices on issues
relating to variances and AOCs.
<P>
<B>Resource Impacts</B> 
<P>
The proposed rule will require AQMD resources to ensure that the
aggregate excess emissions from all sources under federally-recognized
variances will not exceed the SIP Allowance for such emissions.
A fee will be proposed to recover resource costs in the future.
Nevertheless, the implementation of the proposed rule will not
impact the AQMD's budget significantly.

<B><FONT SIZE=4>Background</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Rule 1129 - Aerosol Coatings, and associated coating
rule amendments were adopted November 2, 1990, to reduce VOC emissions
from aerosol coatings. Subsequently, Dunn Edwards Corporation
and two groups of aerosol paint manufacturers each filed a lawsuit
challenging the Rule 1129 adoption and other amendments on numerous
grounds. While the Los Angeles County Superior Court ruled in
favor of the plaintiffs in July of 1991, suspending Rule 1129
and the associated amendments, the AQMD prevailed in its appeal
in May of 1993, allowing the reinstatement.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>In October of 1993, the state legislature adopted
amendments to the State Health and Safety Code Section 41712,
requiring the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to adopt an
aerosol paint regulation and prohibiting local districts from
adopting and enforcing local aerosol paint regulations. Subsequently,

<B><FONT SIZE=4>Proposal</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>To be consistent with state law, staff proposes to
rescind Rule 1129 and to amend Rules 1106.1, 1107, 1128, 1130,
1145 and 1151 to exempt aerosol coating products (aerosol coating
products do not include aerosol adhesives.) Additionally, staff
is proposing language to adopt the CARB definition of &quot;aerosol
coating products&quot; in order to provide rule consistency with
the recently-adopted CARB Aerosol Coating Products Rule. Finally,
staff proposes to amend the definition of &quot;exempt compounds&quot;
in each rule to reference its definition in Rule 102 - Definition
of Terms, which already controls in the event of a conflict in
the rules.<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>AQMD Staff has reviewed the proposed project pursuant
to state CEQA Guidelines Section 15002(k)(1). The proposed recission
implements currently existing state law over which the AQMD has
no discretionary authority. Therefore, the project is exempt from
the requirements of CEQA pursuant to state CEQA Guidelines Section
15268. In addition, the project does not have the potential to
adversely impact the environment and is exempt pursuant to state
CEQA Guidelines section 15061(b)(3).<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Due to the limited nature of the amendments, no socioeconomic
assessment is required. The amendments will not have any effect

<FONT SIZE=4>Staff has reviewed the proposed rescinding of Rule
1129 and the proposed amendments to Rules 1106.1, 1107, 1128,
1130, 1145, and 1151, and has determined that they are exempt
from the requirements of the California Environmental Quality
Act (CEQA), pursuant to State CEQA Guidelines Section 15061(b)(1)
and (b)(3). Therefore, a Notice of Exemption will be prepared
for the proposed amendments and will be filed with the county
clerks immediately following the adoption of the proposed amendments.

<BLOCKQUOTE> Implementation of the California Reformulated Gasoline Program</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B>Synopsis:</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE> This is a joint presentation by the California
Air Resources Board and the Western States Petroleum Association
and will provide an overview of the progress made on the implementation
of the California Reformulated Gasoline (CaRFG) program. CaRFG
is a state-mandated program that requires production and use of
a cleaner-burning gasoline. The use of CaRFG will significantly
reduce emissions of unhealthful pollutants and help the AQMD meet
its air quality objectives.</BLOCKQUOTE>

James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<P>
Executive Officer
<P>
<U>PL:CC:MN:ph </U><HR>
<P>
The South Coast area has the worst air quality in the nation,
and California in general has severe air quality problems. Motor
vehicles are the largest contributor to the air pollution problem.
Almost one-half of the emissions of volatile organic compounds
(VOC) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) are due to motor vehicles. VOC
and NOx contribute to the formation of ground level ozone, which
is the main ingredient in smog.
<P>
Reformulated Gasoline (RFG) is a cleaner-burning gasoline that
will reduce emissions from all gasoline-burning motor vehicles
and engines. RFG is required by U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) and California Air Resources Board (ARB) regulations
to help meet air quality standards. Federal law required the use
of federal RFG in the nine worst-polluted areas in the nation,
including the South Coast, beginning January 1, 1995. State law
requires the production of even cleaner-burning gasoline, California
Phase 2 RFG (CaRFG), by March 1, 1996, and by June 1, 1996 all
gasoline sold in California must be CaRFG.
<P>
Both federal and California RFG reduce levels of ozone, carbon
monoxide and airborne toxic chemicals that can cause cancer. CaRFG
reduces emissions of smog-forming pollutants such as VOC and NOx
by more than twice as much as federal RFG. CaRFG will also reduce
sulfur dioxide emissions. The overall emission reductions from
motor vehicles associated with CaRFG in California are as follows:


<P>
<PRE>
          ------------------------------------------------------  
           CALIFORNIA PHASE 2 RFG EMISSION REDUCTIONS
          ------------------------------------------------------
           Compound                        Reduction 
          ------------------------------------------------------
           Volatile Organic Compounds      17% (190 tons/day)

           Nitrogen Oxides                 11% (110 tons/day)

           Sulfur Dioxide                  80% (30 tons/day)

           Carbon Monoxide                 11% (1,300 tons/day)
          ------------------------------------------------------
<P></PRE>
Emission reductions from motor vehicles in the South Coast Air
Quality Management District (AQMD) alone due to CaRFG will amount
to about 45% of the total emissions reductions expected for all
of California. This is equivalent to immediately removing 1.6
million vehicles from AQMD roads. In addition, CaRFG will reduce
emissions of cancer causing pollutants. As a result, CaRFG will
also reduce the cancer risk due to gasoline powered motor vehicles
by one-third.
<P>
In order to produce RFG, refineries in the AQMD had to spend millions
of dollars to make extensive modifications to their equipment
and processes. All the new equipment installed was equipped with
the Best Available Control Technology, and in some cases, replaced
older and less efficient equipment. AQMD staff worked closely
with the refineries to ensure that necessary Permits to Construct
for the refinery modifications were promptly issued. This required
preparation and certification of several Environmental Impact
Reports (EIRs) and processing of approximately 200 permit applications
in a relatively short time frame. As a result of a coordinated
effort between refinery and AQMD staff, refineries were able to
meet the deadlines for production of federal RFG and are well
on their way to meeting the deadlines for the production of CaRFG.
<P>
At the state level, under the guidance of an advisory committee
which includes experts representing automobile manufacturers,
gasoline manufacturers and government, ARB conducted extensive
testing of CaRFG to ensure a smooth transition to the new fuel.
As part of the testing program, over 800 vehicles of varying age
and mileage were driven five million miles on cleaner-burning
gasoline. The results show that cleaner-burning gasoline works
as well as the gasoline that is currently being used. Testing
was also conducted on other engines powered with gasoline. The
results of this comprehensive testing program did not identify
any problems with the use of CaRFG. As with motor vehicles, cleaner-burning
gasoline is expected to work just as well as today's gasoline
in boats, jet skis, garden equipment, and other gasoline-powered
engines.

<BLOCKQUOTE> Amend Contract with Telos Consulting Services to Increase
the Funding for Systems Development Work</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B>Synopsis:</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE> At its June 10, 1994, meeting, the Board approved a
contract with Telos Consulting Services (Telos) to provide system
development services on a task-by-task basis. This is a basic
ordering agreement, where specific work is defined, and individual
task orders issued. During the contract period, additional funding
is needed as system development requirements are identified. Staff
recommends that the contract be modified to add additional funding
in the amount of $100,000 to accommodate identified projects through
June 1996. Funding is included in the Fiscal Year 1995-96 budget
for Information Management to cover these expenses.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<B>Background</B> 
<P>
At its June 10, 1994, meeting, the Board approved award of a contract
to Telos Consulting Services, a minority-owned business, for systems
development support. This is a task order type contract where
individual work orders are issued on a competitive basis and additional
funding is provided as system development requirements are identified
and task orders issued. The contract is for a one-year period
with two one-year renewal options. The first renewal option has
been exercised and the contract is currently funded from the Information
Management FY 1995-96 budget.
<P>
Five task orders are scheduled to be awarded by May 30, 1996 (see
Attachment 1). The estimated cost to complete the work on these
task orders exceeds the amount of funding in the current contract.
Staff recommends that the contract be modified to add additional
funding in the amount of $100,000 to bring the total contract
value to $620,500 for the two budget years. The amount of additional
funding required is based on the funds remaining in the current
contract and a cost estimation for the upcoming task order awards.

<P>
<B>Background</B> 
<P>
Rule 701, when amended at the September 8, 1995 Governing Board
meeting, removed the requirements for schools and industry to
maintain an antiquated radio system to receive the daily air quality
forecast and episode declaration. In its place, the District committed
to explore updated technology methods to provide episode notification
to school districts. A survey was conducted by the Public Advisor's
Office of school supervisors responsible for re-transmitting the
episode information to the individual schools in their district.
The results indicated that facsimile communication was preferred
as a replacement to the radio system. Providing the school district
headquarters with the episode message by facsimile in a timely
manner requires a &quot;turnkey&quot; operation, utilizing a fast
facsimile technology or equivalent method. While the District
has an existing fast facsimile capability, it is unable to handle
the volume and timing of episode transmission under its current
configuration.
<P>
<B>Proposal</B> 
<P>
Staff recommends that the Board authorize the reallocation of
$40,000 in FY 95/96 budgeted funds to a Planning and Policy Professional
and Special Services account for Communication Services to fund
contractual services for providing a communications link to the
school districts. The scope of the work would either (1) provide
an upgrade to the existing District fast facsimile communications
capability, or (2) require the contractor to provide a fast facsimile
or equivalent service to receive and immediately re-transmit the
District's episode messages directly to the school districts.
Funds for this program are available within the existing FY 1995-96
Budget of Planning, Transportation and Information Management
- $20,000 from 745 (PM10 Model Development) and Stationary Source
Compliance - $10,000 from 735 (Rents &amp; Leases), $5,000 from
750 (Public Notices), and $5,000 from 970 (Miscellaneous Expenses).

<P>
<B>Synopsis:</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE> At its October 1995 meeting, the Board approved the
release of a Request for Proposals to privatize portions of the
annual emissions report program. All proposals submitted were
evaluated and ranked by a panel comprised of District staff and
representatives from The Gas Company and the California Council
for Environmental and Economic Balance. Staff recommends that
the Board award the contract to the successful bidder. Funding
is included in the FY 1995-1996 budget.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
James M. Lents, Ph.D.<BR>
Executive Officer
<P>
BRW:CL:EL:ZP<HR>

<P>
<B>Background</B> 
<P>
Each year by July 1, approximately 6000 facilities receive emission
reporting packages from the AQMD to report their emissions and
pay associated fees for the preceding fiscal year. The emissions
data received is the foundation of the AQMD's emissions inventory,
which is in turn relied upon to support various planning and rulemaking
activities. The annual emission fees received is approximately
$25 million a year.
<P>
The current program requires a variety of resources to prepare
and distribute emission report packages to facilities; to collect,
compile, and review emissions and fee data; and to perform engineering
evaluation of emissions data. AQMD staff believes that privatization
of data collection and compilation could lead to greater efficiency
and lower cost. Actual collection of fees, billing adjustments,
and engineering auditing still will be handled by AQMD staff.
<P>
<B>Bid Evaluation</B> 
<P>
In accordance with the District's Consultant Selection Policy
and Procedure, the RFP was publicly noticed in the Los Angeles
Times, La Opinion, Los Angeles Sentinel, Orange County Register,
Riverside Press Enterprise, San Bernardino Sun, The M/W/DVBE Source,
AQMD Bulletin Board System, AQMD RFP/Bid Telephone Hotline as
well as California State Contract Register. A total of 128 RFPs
were distributed to independent contractors, identified by the
AQMD as potential bidders (including 17 minority or women-owned
firms as well as minority caucuses), and other consulting firms
responding to the advertisements. A bidder's conference was held
at the AQMD headquarters on November 8, 1995 to discuss the major
tasks identified in the RFP and provide responses to questions.
By the close of the bidding period on December 1, 1995, five proposals
were received. The proposals were reviewed by a four-member evaluation
panel consisting of representatives from the AQMD, The Gas Company,
and the California Council for Environmental and Economic Balance
(CCEEB). Evaluation panel members included Elaine Chang (AQMD
Planning Manager), Chris Marlia (AQMD Information Technology Manager),
Lee Wallace (The Gas Company), and Bill Quinn (CCEEB). Of the
five proposals, four proposals did not meet the technical criteria
(i.e., scored below 70 points based on technical criteria specified
in the RFP). The evaluation panel unanimously rated Ecotek the
highest (final score of 87.3) based on their clear understanding
of the work to be performed, innovative approaches proposed, and
extensive prior experience in the field. The evaluation panel
recommended that Ecotek be awarded a contract, based on its successful
point score.
<P>
<B>Resource Impacts</B> 
<P>
Staff recommends that a contract be awarded to Ecotek for an amount
not to exceed $250,000. Sufficient funding is available in the
Fiscal Year 1995-96 Budget.

<B>Background</B> 
<P>
The Contract Source Emissions Testing program provides a cost-effective
way to increase the AQMD's source testing capacity. Between 150
and 400 tests have been contracted out in each of the last seven
years as a supplement to our in-house testing capacity. Staff
has prepared the attached Request for Proposals (RFP) to secure
the services of outside contractors to conduct emissions testing
and reporting during a contract term between August 1, 1996 and
July 31, 1997.
<P>
<B>Proposal</B> 
<P>
This RFP calls for contracting out a number of source tests that
can be completed for a cost not to exceed $300,000 for rule compliance
using District test methods. Staff estimates that between 125
to 150 source tests can be completed for this amount of money.
<P>
In addition to the attached RFP, the following attachments will
be mailed to the prospective contractors following Board approval
of the RFP:

San Bernardino Public Employees Association</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B>SYNOPSIS:</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Collective bargaining mediation discussions between
AQMD management and representatives of the San Bernardino Public
Employees Association resulted in a tentative contract agreement
that was subsequently ratified by members of the Professional
Bargaining Unit.  Under the terms of the agreement, Professional
Unit employees would, as of May 1, 1996, work the same Tuesday-through-Friday
work week as other AQMD employees.  All other terms of the previous
contract would be extended through June 30, 1996.  This recommendation
is to approve the ratified labor contract.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B>COMMITTEE:</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE> The action giving rise to this matter occurred after

continuously briefed in closed session regarding this matter.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B>RECOMMENDED ACTION:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>1. Authorize the AQMD Negotiator and management staff to sign
the ratified <I>Memorandum of Understanding</I> between AQMD and
the San Bernardino Public Employees Association</BLOCKQUOTE>

_____________________________________________________________________
<P>
<B>Background</B>
<P>
On March 9, 1995, negotiations were initiated between AQMD and
the San Bernardino Public Employees Association, representing
the Professional Bargaining Unit, to bargain a successor agreement
to the two parties' July 1, 1994 - June 30, <I>1995 Memorandum
of Understanding</I> (<I>MOU</I>).  After seventeen bargaining
sessions over an eight-month period failed to produce agreement,
the two sides jointly declared negotiations to be at  impasse.
 As required under provisions of AQMD's <I>Employee Relations
Resolution</I>, a mediator from the California Mediation and Conciliation
Service was called in to assist with the process.  
<P>
During the course of mediation, tentative agreement was reached
to implement, for Professional Unit employees, effective May 1,
1996, the same Tuesday-through-Friday work week established earlier
for the rest of the work force and to extend all other provisions
of the earlier <I>MOU</I> through June 30, 1996.  Management tentatively
agreed to make temporary accommodations for employees for whom
the new work week would create verifiable hardships relating to
child care or school scheduling arrangements made in expectation
of a different work schedule.  These employees would have until
July 1, 1996, to resolve personal scheduling problems.  By July
1 all employees would be expected to be on the Tuesday-through-Friday
work week, unless management, to meet operational needs, designates
an alternative schedule for individual employees.

<P>
<B>Work Statement</B> 
<P>
The District conducts various types of mailings annually. Subscription
Services coordinates many of these mailings including the District's
subscription publications. Other mailings include regularly scheduled
mailings for public workshops, rules notification, permit fee
billings, etc. During fiscal year 94/95, the District spent approximately
$80,000 on outside mailing services.
<P>
This bid is to pre-qualify vendors providing mailing services
for the District. The quantities of jobs will range anywhere between
10 pieces to 70,000 pieces per mailing. However, 90% of those
jobs are for quantities of less than 5,000 pieces. Jobs are sent
via U.S. postage certified mail, first class, third class, fourth
class, and via United Parcel Service (UPS) Ground Service and
UPS Delivery Confirmation Service. Jobs include but are not limited
to mailing # 10 envelopes with 1-6 inserts, 9X12 manila envelopes
with single or multiple inserts, self mailers, newsletters, and
books. Mailing weights will vary anywhere between under an ounce
to 10 pounds per piece. Pressure sensitive mailing labels are
most commonly used.
<P>
Contractor will provide mailing services which will include but
is not limited to folding, inserting, sealing, removing duplicate
labels, labeling, tabbing, and metering. Contractor services will
also include the pick up and delivery of material to and from
storage areas within District facility (Diamond Bar), contractor's
location, and the post office. Jobs must be picked up within two
hours of notification. Jobs of less than 5,000 pieces and that
require minimal handling must be delivered to the post office
the same day, if notified by 2:00 pm. Jobs notified after 2:00
pm or that consist of more than 5,000 pieces or that may require
special handling such as certified or registered mail must be
delivered to the post office by the next post office business
day (including Saturday) unless otherwise arranged by District
staff. Contractor may be required to prepare mailings for registered,
certified or overnight delivery. Contractor may be required to
provide for the purchase of SIC codes as needed.
<P>
Contractor may be required to assemble the materials for mailing
or the material may already be assembled and ready for inserting.
In any case, the District will provide a sample of the package
to be mailed. For certain mailings contractor may be required
to match mailing labels to letter inserts with no errors. With
UPS, the contractor may be required to track each package and
provide District with delivery confirmation. With U.S. postal
certified mail delivery, contractor may be required to enter each
mail piece's certified number into a certified mailing book for
record keeping purposes. Contractor must notify the District with
the actual date of mailing after every mailing is completed and/or
provide a mailing statement as a proof of mailing if delivered
directly to the post office. All extra material must be returned
to the District. Contractor will also be responsible to pick up
additional inserts or material as needed when shortages occur
or changes are made.
<P>
In most cases, the District will provide a check for the postage
costs prior to a mailing. However, some mailings will take place
with very little lead time. Contractor may be requested to pay
the postage costs in order to get a mailing out on time. The District
will reimburse the contractor for those postage costs within two
business days. All other mailing service invoices will be paid
within 30 days of receipt of invoice. Contractor will be required
to include some billing information on the invoices as directed
by Mail/Subscription Supervisor.
<P>
Contractor may be required to provide some or all of the above
mentioned services within a very short time frame and possibly

<B>Proposal:</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Status Report on Lead Agency Projects and Environmental
Documents Received by the AQMD</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B>Synopsis:</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE> This report provides for the Governing Board's consideration
a listing of California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) documents
received by the South Coast Air Quality Management District (AQMD)
between October 4, 1995, and November 3, 1995, and those projects
for which the AQMD is acting as lead agency pursuant to CEQA.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<B>Background</B> 
<P>
<B>EIR and Document Log (Attachments A and B)</B> - Each month,
the AQMD receives numerous CEQA documents from other public agencies
on projects which could adversely affect air quality. Listings
of all documents received for review are contained in Attachments
A and B. Monthly listings which are shaded note those CEQA documents
for which the AQMD staff has or will prepare and submit comments
to the lead agency. A list of active projects from previous months
for which AQMD staff is continuing to evaluate or prepare comments
is included as Attachment B. A new column has been added to Attachments
A and B of this report in response to Board member request. The
column captioned &quot;contacts&quot; identifies parties who have
contacted the AQMD with concerns or issues about the proposed
project. A notation of 1 in the contact column indicates the contact
was supportive of the project noted. A notation of 2 indicates
the party was opposed or expressed concerns about the project.
<P>
In the past, AQMD staff routinely reviewed many of these documents
and commented upon the air quality analyses and possible impacts
on the air quality of the district. Due to staffing constraints,
the AQMD is no longer able to routinely comment on all CEQA documents
received. Publication of the Board-approved <I>CEQA Air</I> Q<I>uality
Handbook</I>, however, has provided local governments and other
public agencies with the necessary information to prepare appropriate
air quality analyses on projects for which they act as lead agency.
As resources permit, staff evaluates and may prepare comments
for projects that may have significant adverse regional air quality
impacts (e.g., special event centers, landfills, etc.) and those
projects for which a lead or responsible agency has specifically
requested AQMD review
<P>
<B>AQMD Lead Agency Projects (Attachment C)</B> - Pursuant to
CEQA, the AQMD periodically acts as lead agency on stationary
source permit projects. Under CEQA the lead agency is responsible
for determining whether an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) or
a Negative Declaration is necessary for any proposal considered
to be a &quot;project&quot; as defined by CEQA. An EIR is prepared
when the AQMD as lead agency finds substantial evidence that the
proposed project may have a significant adverse effect on the
environment. A Negative Declaration may be prepared if the AQMD
determines that the proposed project will not generate significant
adverse environmental impacts. The Negative Declaration is a written
statement describing the reasons a proposed project will not have
a significant adverse effect on the environment and, therefore,
does not require the preparation of an EIR.
<P>
Attachment C to this report summarizes the active projects for
which the AQMD is lead agency and is currently preparing or has
prepared environmental documentation. As noted in Attachment C,
during November 1995, the AQMD continued working on CEQA documents
for two (2) active projects. A project at the Mobil Oil Refinery
in Torrance has recently been proposed for which the AQMD will
act as lead agency.
<P>
To date in 1995, the AQMD, as lead agency, has prepared or contracted
for the preparation of and certified four (4) CEQA documents.

<B>Changes in State Assembly</B> 
<P>
Staff provided an update on the changes in the Assembly leadership,
makeup of committees and Assembly rules (<I>Attachment 2</I>).
The committees of most concern to the AQMD in the Assembly are
Appropriations, Budget, Environmental Safety, Local Government,
Natural Resources and Transportation. The chairs of most committees
have been reassigned due to the change in the Assembly speakership.
Several freshman legislators were appointed to key positions.
Staff reported that not much movement has occurred yet on legislative
bills since members have been busy with leadership issues.
<P>
<B>Recommended Positions on Two-Year Bills</B> 
<P>
Staff reported on the status of two-year bills that must be out
of their house of origin in the next few weeks (<I>Attachment
3</I>), and specifically commented on the following bills. Assembly
Bill 1268 by Assembly Speaker Pringle dealing with AQMD city selection
committee members was withdrawn and therefore will not become
a vehicle for Pringle's proposals to change the AQMD. Senate Bill
1122 (Mountjoy), pertaining to small business and environmental
regulations and very similar to AB 177 (see below), was defeated
in the Senate Natural Resources Committee. Board Chairman Jon
Mikels inquired about AB 1240 (Bordonaro) dealing with commercial
space launches. Staff reported that the bill will be amended in
the Senate to narrow its scope. The author's intent is to allow
Vandenberg Air Force Base to develop launch vehicles for space
orbit, but the bill is broadly written and could potentially exempt
all aerospace from regulation.
<P>
Staff also reported there are a couple of new bills dealing with
ozone-depleting compounds, but most new bills will not surface
until next month. The deadline for the introduction of new bills
is February 23.
<P>
Staff provided analyses and recommendations on three bills related
to taxation policies (<I>see Attachment </I>4). The specific bills
discussed are as follows:
<P>
<U><B>Summary of Recommendations</B></U> 
<P>
<U><B>Bill/Title</B></U><B> <U>Recommended Positions</U></B> 
<P>
AB 177 (Mountjoy) -- Control Technology SUPPORT (tax credit portion)
<P>
and Tax Credits and seek clarification regarding
<P>
regulatory provisions
<P>
AB 913 (Cuneen) -- Vanpool Tax Credits SUPPORT
<P>
SB 780 (Leonard) -- Clean Fuel Tax Credits SUPPORT
<P>
SB 780 (Leonard) creates new tax credits and tax exemptions for
clean fuel vehicle fleets and clean fuel stations. Staff reported
that the bill was originally sponsored by United Parcel Service,
but is now the California Trucking Association's bill. Amendments
by the Air Resources Board, state Energy Commission and Franchise
Tax Board have been incorporated into the current version. The
bill now aims to fulfill requirements of the state implementation
plan for heavy duty vehicles by providing tax credits for cleaner
vehicles. Chairman Mikels distributed a letter he received from
Denny Zane of Gladstein &amp; Associates in support of the bill.
In the Chairman's reply to the letter, he indicated the AQMD board
had adopted a Support position on the bill during the last legislative
session (<I>Attachment 5). </I>Staff recommended a &quot;Support&quot;
position for this year with which the Committee concurred.
<P>
AB 913 (Cuneen) extends existing tax credits for private vanpools,
employer shuttle vehicles and subsidized transit passes until
January 1, 2001. Staff reported the bill received widespread support
during the last legislative session, but was caught up in the
broader issue of ridesharing. Staff recommended a &quot;Support&quot;
position which the Committee approved.
<P>
AB 177 (Mountjoy) exempts companies using the &quot;latest proven
technological equipment&quot; and those which voluntarily install
BARCT from other air quality regulations. The bill also establishes
a new 10% tax credit for environmental expenses. Staff indicated
the bill was sponsored, in part, out of concern over VOC RECLAIM.
Staff reported that the regulatory part of the bill has significant
defects and could potentially affect the current RECLAIM program.
Pat Leyden, Deputy Executive Officer/Stationary Source Compliance,
indicated that if companies were only required to meet BARCT,
the South Coast would not be able to reach attainment status.
The Committee agreed that providing tax incentives was desirable,
and approved a support position on that element, but asked that
staff seek clarification and possible amendments on the regulatory
provisions. During the public comment portion of the meeting,
Mr. John Billheimer pointed out that the tax credits contained
in AB 177 apply to equipment only and not to product reformulation.
He suggested that the language be broadened to benefit all small
businesses facing environmental regulations. Staff has reviewed
Mr. Billheimer's suggestion and will make it a part of suggested
amendments to the author.
<P>
<B>Other Business</B> 
<P>
Council Member Nell Soto reported that she had met with several
Legislators while in Sacramento recently and felt it was important
that AQMD Board Members meet regularly with members of the Legislature.
Supervisor Roy Wilson agreed that it was especially important
this year due to changes in leadership and should be an ongoing
effort. No formal Committee action was needed to implement Council
Member Soto's suggestion. Members will simply pursue such contacts
as travel plans allow, with staff's assistance.

Council minutes for the December 13, 1995, meeting (<I>Attachment

<P>
<B>Attendees</B> 
<P>
Chair Mee Lee and Committee Members Ron Loveridge, James Silva,
Candace Haggard, and Nell Soto were present.
<P>
<B>Summary</B> 
<P>
The Committee reviewed the items on their agenda (copy produced
below). Comments were noted on the following items:
<P>
1. New Source Review
<BR>
The Committee received the status report and sought clarifications
on a number of points. On the issue of &quot;past NSR debts paid,&quot;
the Committee felt that some equity adjustment should be developed.
The Committee also discussed the fact that the Home Rule Working
Group had reviewed NSR issues and would be discussing the item
further at their February meeting.
<P>
2. Air Toxics 1996 Annual Report
<BR>
The 1996 Annual Report was presented. The program has been very
successful in producing voluntary reductions of toxic emissions.
The Committee discussed the proposal to make the public meetings
optional. Concern was expressed over this proposal. The Committee
Members were opposed to reducing the requirements for these meetings.
In addition, they wanted an opportunity to consider expanding
the criteria for public notice.
<P>
3. Expedited Permitting Service
<BR>
The Committee Members were very supportive of the proposal.
<P>
4. Amnesty Program
<BR>
The progress of the program was discussed. Three months into the
program, over 300 permit applications have been received for:
auto repair, auto body shops, printers, and I/C engines. Roughly
half of the applications received have resulted in permits being
issued. Many of the companies responding are involved in Freon
recycling. The Committee also discussed the fact that only some
of the fees were waived. The term &quot;amnesty&quot; to some
businesses implied carte blanche waiving of fees, when that isn't
the case. The program provides &quot;partial&quot; fee amnesty.

<B>Approval of October 26, 1995, Minutes</B> 
<P>
Board Member Jon Mikels called for a motion on the October 26,
1995, IAIC meeting minutes.
<P>
<I>On motion by Council Member Eunice Ulloa, and seconded by Council
Member Judy Wright, the October 1995 minutes were approved, as
submitted.</I> 
<P>
<B>Report by TAC Chairman on Technical Advisory Committee Meeting</B>

<P>
In the absence of TAC Chair Jim Stahl, Greg Adams of the Los Angeles
County Sanitation Districts, reported that the TAC focused four
key issues.
<P>
First, staff reviewed Rule 2202 (On-Road Motor Vehicle Mitigation
Options). The TAC focused on the flexibilities of Rule 2202 and
the federal requirement on employers to reduce emissions associated
with employee trips which was <U>not</U> affected as a result
of the new mandates initiated by Senators Hurtt and Manzullo.
The TAC also discussed the various emissions-based programs available
if an employer does not choose to buyout its employees in the
Air Quality Investment Program or maintain an existing ridesharing
program.
<P>
Second, the TAC discussed New Source Review in light of the AQMD
Board's action on December 7, 1995. The TAC focused on the issues
which were carried over by the Board, including visibility, whether
privately owned and operated landfills should be excluded from
the Priority Reserve Offset Bank, the 4-tons per year exemption
level for small business facilities, and portable equipment definitions
and requirements. The visibility issue is being resolved through
meetings with industry, and the sentiment is that the burden for
performing visibility analysis will move from facilities currently
triggered by the Community Bank level (approximately 30 lbs per
day) to the Prevention of Significant Deterioration level (100
tons per year for specific facilities, such as power plants, and
250 tons per year for other facilities). Furthermore, the AQMD
is considering performing a regional haze analysis with urban
airshed models and some screening modeling. The public/private
landfill issue centers around the expansion of those facilities
which will not be able to access the Priority Reserve to obtain
free ERCs, such as hospitals, water purveyors and perhaps transit
authorities. The portable equipment issue is also being further
analyzed. The TAC believes it will be able to report on the final
resolution of these issues at the IAIC's next meeting, and the
revisions are to be considered by the AQMD Board in May 1996.
<P>
Third, because the VOC RECLAIM Program has been temporarily suspended,
industry-specific rules will now move forward; six rules which
have significant emissions reductions associated with them will
be the priority focus. In addition, these rules will be tied into
intercredit trading, which was the last topic discussed by the
TAC. Mr. Adams believes that intercredit trading is the most significant
issue in the air pollution arena at this time. He believes that
staff's policy paper released in October was the result of Assembly
Bill 1777 which essentially required the state to put together
a program to allow fluid transmission of credits between stationary,
mobile, area and indirect sources. Staff has currently received
12 responses to its proposal and intends to have a combined Planning
&amp; Stationary Source Committee meeting on January 30 to address
this issue. A staff presentation to the Board on February 9, 1996,
and a public hearing in March 1996 have tentatively been scheduled.
The issues in debate are 1) whether there should be interseasonal
or multi-year banking, the latter of which is favored by industry;
and 2) whether there should be a discount factor, and if it will
be at a flat rate and what its purpose will be.
<P>
<B>Update on REACH Task Force </B>
<P>
As co-chair of the REACH Task Force, along with Chairman Mikels,
Council Member Wright briefly reported on the January 24 meeting
at which the Task Force reached consensus on the assumptions for
modeling. Since some of the ridesharing rules are in question,
this effort may be the only way to reduce emissions from mobile
sources. However, although no policy decisions have been made
on what will be used for modeling, the Task Force will ensure
that it is consistent with that performed for the 1997 AQMP. For
instance, the Task Force is considering not only VMTs at certain
corridors, but also road charges and congestion pricing or a hybrid
of the two. The Task Force is also considering whether the program
should be revenue neutral, which the AQMD prefers, but first a
definition of revenue neutral must be agreed to and the question
of whether the loss of the current gas tax can be compensated
must be addressed. She commented that the Task Force needs a replacement
from Riverside County with the departure of Dick McGregor and
added that the Task Force meets monthly and alternates its meetings
between the AQMD and SCAG locations.
<P>
Greg Adams commented that the TAC was wondering if an employer
can take credit for picking up the tab for its employees for the
91 toll-way. Barbara Baird, AQMD District Counsel, replied that
she believes this would be double-counting since she understands
that emissions reduction credits for the 91 toll-way have been
included in the AQMP. Chairman Mikels added that in examining
the pricing elasticities, in terms of costs, there is one cost
for congestion relief and another for equivalent emissions reductions.
<P>
<B>Update on Alternative Fuels/ZEV Mandate</B> 
<P>
Council Member John Cox stated that besides congestion pricing,
the next alternative is technology. Laboratories throughout the
area are trying to quantify emissions from the Intelligent Transportation
System technology. In fact, the ITS Priority Corridor Program,
which is funded by the Federal Government, was developed to determine
how to deploy the ITS technology. Mr. Cox recently attended an
ITS Priority Corridor Conference at which he learned that a variety
of tests are being performed including test beds on freeways using
road sensors and cameras which track automobiles on every lane.
Roadways and traffic can be viewed at the Caltrans Teletraffic
Management Center, and by linking up to telecommunications fiberoptics,
Caltrans can communicate with the Anaheim Traffic Center. In addition,
UCI, through a research grant, has replicated a similar system
but it has also designed a simulator to develop a nexus between
the benefits associated with ITS. Council Member Wright commented
that the REACH Task Force is considering whether there is technology
available to measure emissions benefits at the gas pump rather
than through ITS since many consider ITS invasive.
<P>
Council Member Cox commented that although there has been significant
attitude changes in recent years toward Regulation XV and the
ZEV Mandates, the Clean Air Act obligations must still be met.
There has been so much negative publicity about electric vehicles
and the ZEV Mandate over the last year, especially since it appeared
that the ARB was moving away from them, that many thought this
meant that nothing had to be done anymore. In fact, the auto industry
has agreed to make at least 5,000 clean vehicles available over
the next two years, which was not in the prior ZEV Mandate. In
1998 the Auto Industry will provide a manufacturing capacity of
14,000 vehicles, and in 2003 the 10% mandate is effective. Immediately
after those behind-the-scenes agreements, General Motors introduced
the EV-1 or the Impact, and GM is prepared to produce 5,000 EVs
over the next two years. Following that commitment, Edison announced
the formation of a subsidiary company which will handle EV infrastructure
on the customer end. In particular, it is very important for the
cities to assist in the marketing of these vehicles. If the vehicles
do not sell, it will not be because they are unavailable, but
because infrastructure and support systems are unavailable.
<P>
Saturn will be the initial dealerships which will sell the EVs
this year, and there are rumors that Saturn will also have a four-door
EV sedan next year. Chevrolet will sell S10 EV pickup trucks in
1997, and Toyota, who was ignoring the mandates, suddenly announced
that it has an EV demonstration in the U.S. Council Member Cox
believes the blitz of negative publicity is about to reverse.
There is tremendous opportunity for cities to participate in the
process, both for infrastructure and procurement. For procurement
of vehicles, the AB 2766 Discretionary Program has established
a $5,000 rebate on EVs, and is establishing a Corridor Communities
Program to provide for some initial infrastructure, not to mention
that cities can use their own AB 2766 funds towards vehicles and
infrastructure, so they can save money from their General Funds.
In the future, this Basin will be considering similar things for
ITS, telecommunications, and smart shuttle transit which are starting
to develop. Council Member Cox encouraged cities to start partnering
with each other.
<P>
Council Member Judy Wright wondered if the foreign markets will
undo the domestic market because it will produce something cheaper
or if the U.S. is ahead of the curve. Council Member Cox stated
that GM is ahead with its products, but the European market is
not far behind; for instance, some of their battery technology
is better. In response to a comment by Chairman Mikels, Council
Member Cox clarified that GM's opposing position to the ZEV Mandates
was because they had the only game in town at that time, and the
mandates would produce competition. By removing the ZEV Mandates,
GM would remove its competition. Now the EV market is fully open
to GM. The IAIC also briefly discussed natural gas fleet vehicles,
and the Basin's need to establish more maintenance training programs
for such vehicles and the need for cities to send their fleet
managers to such training programs.
<P>
Chairman Mikels concluded the discussion by noting that initially
the public sector will have to lead the way to kick-start the
market, and to the extent that it does, the infrastructure issues
will respond to the public sector and then become available to
the private sector.
<P>
<B>Adopt 1996 Meeting Schedule</B> 
<P>
The consensus was that the meeting dates were convenient for the
Committee, but that the 10 a.m. meeting time was not. The Committee
expressed a desire to move to either a 1 p.m. or 3 p.m. meeting
start time.
<P>
<I>On motion by Council Member John Cox, and seconded by Council
Member Judy Wright, the IAIC approved the meeting dates, but postponed
a decision about the meeting start times.</I> 
<P>
<B>ACTION:</B> Chairman Mikels reported that he would work with
the IAIC secretary to identify a workable start time and contact
the Committee sufficiently in advance of the next meeting.
<P>
<B>Report on Local Government Outreach Activities</B> 
<P>
Oscar Abarca, AQMD Intergovernmental Affairs Director, reminded
the IAIC that in July 1995, the Intergovernmental Affairs staff
expanded its outreach efforts to better acquaint local elected
officials with the AQMD. Since the expanded outreach effort was
initiated, he and Larry Rhinehart have made presentations to over
100 city councils, established contact with the local office of
many state legislators in the Basin, and held over 400 meetings
with city staff and officials. Presentations have focused on the
AQMD's Clean Air Partnership, the Amnesty Program, Rule 2202,
small business assistance, and business retention and development
programs. In addition, the AB 2766 Program, both the discretionary
and city subvention portions, have been successfully carried out,
including numerous meetings, workshops and open houses.
<P>
<B>Update on AB 2766 Discretionary Fund Process</B> 
<P>
In the absence of MSRC Chair John Longville, Drue Ramirez reported
that a listing of the projects approved for funding in the FY
1995-97 AB 2766 Discretionary Work Program and a report on other
ongoing activities were included in the agenda package. In addition,
the MSRC recently convened its Lessons Learned Subcommittee which
looks back at its efforts in developing the most recent Work Program
and will define additional focused Requests for Proposals for
release in FY 1996-97. In March 1996 the AQMD Board will be considering
release of a $600,000 RFP for a Corridor Communities Program which
will assist communities in preparing for EVs by testing the consumer
market and demonstrating the infrastructure, permitting process,
and coordination necessary for the smooth introduction of larger
quantities of EVs.
<P>
<B>Monthly Progress Report on Public Advisor Office Activities</B>

<P>
The agenda package included the Public Advisor's Monthly Activity
Report for December 1995. In addition, La Ronda Bowen, AQMD Public
Advisor, commented that the Public Advisor's office has undergone
some recent organizational changes. Specifically, Economic Development
and Business Retention and the Office of Small Business Assistance
were moved under the purview of the Public Advisor. Ms. Bowen
briefly reviewed the issues these units address.
<P>
<I>There being no public comment or further business, the IAIC
meeting adjourned at 11:00 a.m.</I>

<B>Synopsis:</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Air districts are responsible for implementing requirements
of the Air Toxics &quot;Hot Spots&quot; Information and Assessment
Act of 1987 (AB2588). One requirement of the program is an annual
report. This report highlights activities and progress through
1995 and provides a summary of anticipated activities during 1996.

Air Toxics &quot;Hot Spots&quot; Program 1995 Annual Report
<P>
<B>Background</B> 
<P>
Pursuant to the California Air Toxic &quot;Hot Spots&quot; Information
and Assessment Act of 1987 (the Act, AB2588), the South Coast
Air Quality Management District (AQMD) determines which facilities
must prepare HRAs and whether HRAs are adequate. One additional
requirement of the Act is for local air districts to provide the
public with an annual summary of the risk assessment component
of the program.
<P>
The attached report provides a summary of the AB2588 risk assessment
program during 1995 and provides recommendations to continue with
staff efforts to streamline implementation and complete this component
of the program over the next two years.
<P>
By the time of the next annual report, the majority of the initial
334 HRAs are expected to be completed. In addition, up to 200
Phase II and III HRAs will be in preparation.
<P>
The original procedures and policies for public notifications
were approved by the Governing Board on September 25, 1992. One
Board motion amended the staff proposal to require a public meeting
following the mail out of all notifications. To date, seven facilities
have held public meetings following issuance of notices. These
meetings have been very poorly attended. Because of this and direction
from the Board's Stationary Source Committee, AQMD staff is looking
into ways to enhance outreach for the meetings.

<B>Background</B> 
<P>
At the January 12, 1996 Board meeting, I transmitted to the Board
and public the AQMD's Program Goals/Objectives for Fiscal Year
(FY) 1996-97. I believe it is important for as many interested
parties as possible to have early input into the budget process.
Therefore, I requested that a public hearing on this matter be
scheduled for the February 9, 1996 meeting of the Board.
<P>
Attached are the Program Goals/Objectives transmitted last month.
These goals, which may be modified as a result of public input
and Board direction, will be used in developing next year's work
program and budget request. A public workshop has been tentatively
planned for April 17, 1996 to present the AQMD's budget request
and Work Program for FY 1996-97.

<B>Synopsis:</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE> In April 1995, AQMD initiated the Intercredit
Trading Study. The objective of this study is to assess the feasibility
of linking the AQMD's mobile and stationary emissions credit trading
programs to increase compliance flexibility while achieving air
quality goals. In October 1995, AQMD staff released for public
review a draft paper on issues surrounding intercredit trading.
Four workshops were held in November. Based on public comments
received, staff has finalized its policy recommendations and prepared
an action plan for Board consideration. A rulemaking schedule

<P>
Attachment: Intercredit Trading Study - Proposed Recommendations
and Action Plan
<P><HR>

<P>
<B>Background</B> 
<P>
AQMD has been working on more open and flexible trading programs
to provide additional compliance flexibility. On October 13, 1995,
the &quot;Concept Paper for Increased Compliance Flexibility&quot;
was presented to the Governing Board and released for public review.
This white paper outlined the AQMD staff's preliminary policy
positions on key issues surrounding intercredit trading and was
designed to stimulate further dialogue between the AQMD and the
public on these key issues.
<P>
To seek public input, AQMD staff conducted an extensive public
outreach effort by inviting over 10,000 companies and other interested
parties to participate in four public workshops held during November.
To provide interested parties additional opportunity to comment
on this study, the public comment period was extended from December
1, 1995 to January 12, 1996. Meanwhile, AQMD staff also conducted
additional air quality, health, and socioeconomic analyses to
identify key policy implications.
<P>
A final report with staff recommendations and an action plan for
rulemaking has been prepared and is presented for a public hearing.
<P>
<B>Proposal</B> 
<P>
Staff proposes the recommendations and the action plan in the
attached &quot;Intercredit Trading Study.&quot; In addition, staff
proposes to implement the action plan and initiate rule development.
It is critical to work out details on key design issues and administrative
procedures to ensure credits are real, quantifiable, and surplus.
<P>
<B>Summary of Key Policy Issues and Recommendations</B> 
<UL>
<LI><B>Trading Interaction</B>: A universal market can be created
with minimal restrictions to allow emission credits to flow between
various regulatory programs.
<LI><B>Universe of Sources</B>: The existing trading universe
can be expanded to allow more sources to generate and use emission
credits.
<LI><B>Trading Instrument</B>: A uniform trading instrument can
be developed to simplify credit transactions while maintaining
the integrity of existing credit programs.
<LI><B>Discount and Offset Factors</B>: A discount factor should
be applied when appropriate to ensure real and quantifiable emission
credits. An offset factor provides a tool for environmental benefit
and the need for such a factor should be evaluated as part of
the 1997 AQMP.
<LI><B>Interseasonal Trading</B>: There is a potential air quality
benefit in shifting VOC emissions from summer to winter months.
In addition, increasing winter VOC emissions would not cause any
ozone exceedances.
<LI><B>Banking</B>: Allowing banking incentivizes clean technologies
and early reductions, contributing to the overall attainment strategy.
However, such a program requires proper program design with backstop
measures to ensure reasonable further progress and attainment
demonstration.
<LI><B>Interpollutant Trading</B>: Current PM10 interpollutant
trading provisions pursuant to NSR should be retained until information
becomes available to support expansion.

<BLOCKQUOTE> Issue a Request For Proposals for a Management
Firm to Operate the Diamond Bar Headquarters Child Care Center</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B>Synopsis:</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE> On April 14, 1995, the Board awarded a bid to
Bright Horizons Children's Centers, Inc., to manage and operate
the child care center at the District's Headquarters facility.
Bright Horizons notified the District on January 30, 1996 that
it has decided to terminate the contract, and staff is requesting
permission to develop a new Request For Proposal (RFP) and seek
bids. Because the District was only notified on January 30, discussion
leading up to development of RFP language will prevent the RFP
from being provided with this Board letter. The RFP will instead
be provided at the February Board meeting.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Background</B> 
<P>
The District has been working with Bright Horizons Children's
Center to resolve various issues relating to operation of the
child care center. Since Bright Horizons has now notified the
District of its intent to terminate its contract, staff believes
an RFP should be promptly issued to attempt to ensure continuous
operation of the child care center.
<P>
<B>Proposal</B> 
<P>
Staff is preparing a Request For Proposals (RFP) to solicit bids
for a new child care center management services firm to operate
the District's child care center. The RFP will be provided at
the February 9, 1996 Board meeting.

<U><B>CALL TO ORDER<BR>
</B></U>
<P>
 The meeting was called to order at 10:20 a.m. by Chairman Mikels.
<BR>

<P>
 Catherine Witherspoon, Legislative Director, reported that the
purpose of the special meeting was to allow the Board to consider
and adopt a position on Senate Bill 836 (Lewis), reactivated on
February 20, which would repeal District Rule 2202.  In addition,
there were five other bills introduced on February 13 and 16 for
which staff recommended the Board adopt positions.  Ms. Witherspoon
presented analyses of the bills as set forth below, and recommended
that the Board adopt &quot;oppose&quot; positions on all six of
the bills; except SB 1602, for which staff had no recommendation.
<BR>

<P>
 Legislative Director Catherine Witherspoon explained that a Special
Board Meeting was necessary because SB 836 will be considered
by the Legislature before the March 8 Board Meeting, and the remaining
bills can only be influenced in the Senate early in the process.
<BR>

<P>
(Mr. Braude arrived at 10:25 a.m.)<BR>

<P>
<U>SB 836 (Lewis):</U>  Voids District Rule 2202, refunds Air
Quality Investment Program funds to contributing employers, prohibits
AQMD from adopting new employer-based trip reduction rules, and
requires legislative authorization for indirect source rules adopted
before January 1, 2000.<BR>

<P>
<U>SB 1601 (Lewis):</U>  Freezes AQMD's operating budget at the
Fiscal Year 1996-97 level, requires excess revenues to be submitted
to the State General Fund, requires statutory authorization for
new or adjusted fees, fines or other monetary charges, and undoes
equity language in last year's Russell Bill (SB 962).<BR>

<P>
<U>SB 1602 (Lewis):</U>  Decreases the size of the AQMD Governing
Board from 12 to 9 members (4 appointees and 5 directly elected
members, coinciding with gubernatorial elections) and adds a two-term
limit (8 years).  <I><B>No recommendation.  Staff deferred to
the Board's judgment regarding the appropriate size, composition
and service terms of the Board.<BR>
</B></I>
<P>
<U>SB 1603 (Lewis):</U>  Removes indirect source mandates and
authorities from air districts statewide, prohibits all agencies
in the South Coast region from adopting indirect source measures,
repeals Rule 2202 by default and requires proportional mobile/stationary
control measures.<BR>

<P>
<U>SB 1518 (Hurtt):</U>  Places all AQMD revenues in the State
General Fund and requires legislative authorization for all AQMD
expenditures.  Takes effect July 1, 1997 and sunsets January 1,
2000.<BR>

<P>
 In general, the Board opposed the bills as reversing the AQMD's
progress in cleaning up the air to protect public health, as contrary
to other mandates elsewhere in state law as well as federal law,
and as an untenable usurpation of local control.<BR>

<P>
 Public comment was presented by Curtis Coleman, representing
the California Manufacturers Association, Southern California
Air Quality Alliance and Jeb Stuart, representing the Construction
Industry Air Quality Coalition, who indicated that they would
be recommending to their alliance/coalition membership that they
oppose SB 1601, SB 1602 and (Stuart only) <BR>
SB 1518.  Mr. Stuart suggested, if the general feeling among industry
is to oppose these bills, that AQMD organize a group of industry
representatives, including small businesses, and coordinate presentations
by them to the various committees of the legislature.<BR>

<P>
 The Board voted to oppose each bill, as follows:<BR>

<P>
ON MOTION OF MR. PAULITZ, SECONDED BY MS. SOTO, A UNANIMOUS VOTE
WAS CAST BY THE BOARD MEMBERS PRESENT (Absent:  Antonovich, Hewitt

 Issue a Request for Proposals as an Element of the Fiscal
Year 1995-97 AB 2766 Discretionary Work Program for the Final
Component of the Zero-Emission Vehicle &quot;Quick Charge&quot;
Program
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B>Synopsis:</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 As part of the Fiscal Year 1995-97 AB 2766 Discretionary
Work Program, the MSRC proposed a three-component, $7 million
 Zero-Emission Vehicle &quot;Quick Charge&quot; Program, including
an Outreach Coordinator, a buydown incentive, and an Electric
Vehicle Corridor Communities Program.  The first two components
were previously approved by the Board.  The EV Corridor Communities
Program component will assist communities in preparing for EVs
by testing the consumer market and demonstrating the infrastructure,
permitting process, and coordination necessary for the smooth
introduction of larger quantities of EVs.  This RFP provides $600,000
for this effort, including a $75,000 minimum award to each of
the four counties.

<B>Background</B>
<P>
Assembly Bill 2766 provides that 30 percent of an annual $4 vehicle
registration fee subvened to the AQMD be placed into an account
to be allocated pursuant to a work program developed and adopted
by the MSRC and approved by the AQMD Governing Board.  On December
7, 1995, the AQMD Governing Board approved the MSRC's Fiscal Year
1995-97 AB 2766 Discretionary Fund Work Program, including a three-component,
$7 million Zero-Emission Vehicle &quot;Quick Charge&quot; Program,
including an Outreach Coordinator, a buydown incentive, and an
Electric Vehicle Corridor Communities Program.  In November 1995
the Planning Center, with subcontractors Southern California Economic
Partnership and Battelle Memorial Institute, was chosen as the
ZEV &quot;Quick Charge&quot; Outreach Coordinator for an 18-month
appointment for an amount not to exceed $175,000, and a $6 million
RFQ was released in early December 1995 for the $5,000 buydown
incentive.  The final element is an EV Corridor Communities Program.
 
<P>
<B>Proposal</B>
<P>
The MSRC's technical staff has prepared the attached RFP to solicit
the participation of general purpose local governments in a demonstration
of electric vehicles and infrastructure within the South Coast
Air District.   The EV Corridor Communities Program will demonstrate
the infrastructure, permitting process, and coordination within
and between communities, utilities, and manufacturers necessary
to facilitate the introduction of larger quantities of Evs.  Although
all South Coast Air Quality Management District communities are
eligible to participate, this program encourages deployment of
EVs focused along three priority corridors (the 405, 10, and 215/91)
and within communities that have committed to be &quot;EV-ready&quot;
by encouraging the lease or purchase of EVs, installation of public
charging infrastructure, and adoption of &quot;EV-friendly&quot;
ordinances.  This program element is funded at $825,000, although
it may be augmented later in the process.  Currently, the RFP
provides for $600,000 in funding through a competitive bid process,
including a $75,000 minimum award to each of the four counties
within the South Coast Air District.  The remaining $225,000 has
been set aside in a program reserve to provide funding for underserved
communities or strategic locations which may not receive funding
through the competitive bid process.  The MSRC wants the funds
to be diffused throughout the four counties in order to ensure
the success of EVs throughout the region.  In addition, this funding
is intended to be used to leverage contributions from other sources.
  Partnerships are encouraged among two or more local governments
or local government(s) and utilities, private entities and/or
business enterprises.  All proposals submitted in response to
the RFP will be due at the District by <B>5:00 p.m.</B> Wednesday,
July 10, 1996.  Contract awards will be submitted to the AQMD
Governing Board for consideration in September 1996.

 The AQMD's Program Cost Estimates for Implementing the
Air Toxics &quot;Hot Spots&quot; Information and Assessment Act
(AB 2588) During Fiscal Year 1996-97
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B>Synopsis:</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The Air Toxics &quot;Hot Spots&quot; Information and
Assessment Act (AB-2588, H&amp;S Code Section 44300 et. seq.)
requires air districts to transmit annually to California Air
Resources Board (CARB), an AQMD Board-approved cost estimate for
local program implementation.  This proposed estimate must be
approved and transmitted to CARB before April 1, 1996 to be included
in the state's new approved fee rule.  The AQMD cost estimate
for the Fiscal Year <BR>
1996-97 is based on the Three-Year Budget Forecast.  Staff recommends
approval of this cost estimate and its transmittal to CARB.

<P>
 Air Toxics Hot Spots Program Cost Estimate for FY 1996-97
<P>
<U> </U>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
<P>
The AB 2588 Fee Regulation, which recovers state and local program
costs, requires the AQMD to transmit an annual program cost estimate
to CARB annually by April 1 for the following fiscal year.  Alternatively,
the AQMD must establish its own annual fee schedule by rule to
collect the AQMD and state costs for implementation of the program.
 The fees assessed through this regulation are used to:
<UL>
<LI>inventory toxic air emissions;
<LI>prioritize facilities for preparation of risk assessments;
<LI>review risk assessments;
<LI>notify the public of potential health risk from exposure to
the emissions; and,
<LI>provide guidance to the facilities in reducing the potential
risks from exposure to the emissions.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
The AQMD's cost estimate and estimates from other districts, CARB,
and the state Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment
(OEHHA) are used by CARB to calculate the fees each district charges
to facilities in its jurisdiction.  The Fee Regulation is amended
by CARB each year to incorporate these program cost estimates
and other changes.  The fees are specifically designated for the
purpose of administering and implementing the mandated requirements
of the Act and cannot be used for any other purpose.  The AQMD
collects the fees and transmits the state portion of the collected
fees to CARB.
<P>
With the exception of Fiscal Year (FY) 1995-96, the AQMD has been
included in this Fee Regulation since 1989.  For FY 1995-96, AQMD
is preparing its own fee regulation to recover these costs.  This
is required because the AQMD did not transmit its cost estimate
before the cut-off deadline.  However, staff will be proposing
fee schedules identical to those in this year's state regulation.
<P>
<B>Fiscal Year 1996-97 Cost Estimate</B>
<P>
Staff has developed a program cost estimate for FY 1996-97 based
on both the Three-Year Budget Forecast and costs incurred during
FY 1995-96.  The attached table contains a summary and breakdown
of the AQMD's estimated AB 2588 program cost for FY 1996-97 which
totals $2,040,232.
<P>
In FY 96-97, projected AQMD costs will be down by $691,581 (25%)
compared to our current year (FY 1995-96).  This reduction will
be achieved by the reduction of staff and outside contracts. 

<P>
Even with this reduction, fees may increase for two reasons. 
A number of high fee payers will revert to lower fee schedules
as their status in the program changes.  This is because a number
of facilities will have their health risk assessments approved
by AQMD, thereby placing them in lower fee schedules.  Overall,
collections could drop faster than expenses.  Additionally, many
low-risk sources have been exempted from paying fees.  The state-wide
process for exempting de minimis sources is ongoing and this could
cut revenues further, leaving fewer sources to bear the program
costs.

 Issue a Request for Proposals for Independent Audit Services
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B>Synopsis:</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 A financial audit is annually performed on the AQMD
in compliance with the Government Code and Single Audit Act of
1984. This audit is performed by independent Certified Public
Accountants, and their reports are addressed to the Governing
Board. The three-year contract with the AQMD's current auditors
expires on June 30, 1996. This RFP is for financial audit services
for fiscal years 1995-96, 1996-97, and 1997-98

ATTACHMENT

<P>
<B>Background</B> 
<P>
An independent financial audit results in an expression of an
opinion on the fairness of AQMD's financial statements, and will
include a management letter advising the AQMD of any material
weaknesses in internal control, and all necessary reports on the
AQMD's compliance with federally assisted programs.
<P>
<B>Proposal</B> 
<P>
It is the practice of the AQMD to go out to bid at least every
three years for the purposes of testing the market and providing
the opportunity for other qualified firms to compete for AQMD
procurements. Staff has prepared the attached RFP for the financial
audit for fiscal years ending June 30, 1996, 1997, 1998 and intends
to advertise for bids from qualified public accounting firms.
A panel comprised of outside and AQMD representatives will evaluate
all submitted proposals and provide to the Administrative Committee
a list of the top qualified firms for their consideration. The
Administrative Committee will make the recommendation to the Governing
Board for final selection of a contractor.

In July 1995 AQMD Administrative Policy and Procedures No. 20,
Fixed Assets, was revised. Fixed assets are now generally defined
as assets which have a life of at least three years and a significant
value of at least $1,500. The Fiscal Year 1995-96 budget adopted
in May 1995 includes several items that no longer meet the fixed
asset definition. As a result of the policy revision, the funds
for budgeted fixed asset items #4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,
15, 18, 20, 41, 46, 47, 55, 56, and 60 should be moved from the
Fixed Asset account (account #900) to the Office Expense account
(account #815) and the budgeted funds for fixed asset items #29
and 31 should be moved to the Lab Supplies account (account #805).
<P>
Three Governing Board member assistants have been identified as
contract AQMD employees. Funds budgeted for their services need
to be moved from the Professional and Special Services account
to the Salary account.
<P>
Technical Support Services requests that $1,000 be transferred
from their Overtime account to their Film account for film used

 Execute a Contract to Cost-Share Heavy-Duty Vehicle
Chassis Dynamometer Testing to Improve the Current Emissions Inventory
and to Analyze the Impact of Clean Fuels
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B>Synopsis:</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The current State model may not accurately reflect
on-road heavy-duty vehicle emissions or the impact of these vehicles
on the inventory. In this proposal, in-use heavy-duty vehicles
of various weight classes and fuel types will be recruited for
emissions testing. Data collected will be used to improve the
on-road heavy-duty vehicle emissions inventory, and to assess
the benefits of clean fuels. Staff recommends executing an agreement
with the California Air Resources Board in an amount not to exceed
$200,000 to cost-share this $850,000 project.

<P>
James M. Lents, Ph.D.<BR>
Executive Officer

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>MAN:CNA</FONT>
<HR>

<P>
<B>Background</B> 
<P>
Light-duty vehicle emissions control technology has been very
effective in reducing emissions. Therefore, the relative contribution
of other vehicle classes to overall emissions in the South Coast
Air Basin has increased. For example, the small population of
heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) is the second highest contributor to
the on-road nitrogen oxides (NOx) inventory. HDVs, especially
those powered by diesel fuel, are also responsible for the greatest
contribution of exhaust particulate matter (PM) to the on-road
mobile source inventory.
<P>
In the current State motor vehicle emissions model, EMFAC7F, HDV
emission rates are based on engine, rather than chassis dynamometer
testing. In engine dynamometer testing, a weight-specific conversion
factor that is a function of fuel density, engine fuel consumption,
and vehicle fuel economy is used to convert engine dynamometer-based
emissions values from grams per brake horsepower hour to grams
per mile. The grams per mile emissions rates are also adjusted
to account for tampering and mal-maintenance of emissions-related
components that have occurred in use. With chassis dynamometer
testing, grams per mile emissions values are directly determined.
<P>
<B>Proposal</B> 
<P>
The California Air Resources Board (ARB) intends to release a
request for proposals (RFP) to develop a database to improve the
current on-road HDV emission inventories. In this project, HDVs
(excluding buses) of various weight classes and fuel types will
be tested over different transient cycles for hydrocarbons (HC),
carbon monoxide (CO), NOx, carbon dioxide (CO2), and PM exhaust
emissions. There is considerable concern regarding the differences
in emissions data gathered from an engine dynamometer, rather
than a chassis dynamometer. In addition, since the engine dynamometer
tampering and mal-maintenance adjustment factors were obtained
from work done by the ARB in 1987, there is also concern that
these factors may not accurately reflect current on-road emissions
and, therefore, the emissions impact of HDVs on the inventory.
<P>
This proposed project will attempt to confront and resolve these
issues according to the following major goals: (1) recruit and
test a fleet of in-use HDVs for exhaust emissions on a chassis
dynamometer using transient driving cycles; (2) collect HDV emissions
data in such a manner as to allow for estimation of the effects
of vehicle loading on emissions; (3) collect HDV emissions data
to allow for estimation of the emissions effects due to vehicle/engine
operation in the idle mode; (4) collect HDV emissions data to
allow for estimation of start emissions; (5) collect HDV emissions
data to allow for an analysis of the emissions impact of tampering
and mal-performing components.
<P>
This proposed project is included in the Technology Advancement
Plan for the Clean Fuels Program as project TR-01, &quot;Advanced
Transportation Systems Research, Development and Demonstration.&quot;
The expected benefits of this project include the generation of
data which can be used to improve the State HDV emissions inventories.
In addition, this project will provide for direct analysis of
emissions benefits of alternative fuel HDVs in terms of percent
reductions in grams per mile.
<P>
<B>Sole Source Justification</B> 
<P>
Section II, Step 3(C) of the Consultant Selection Policy identifies
four provisions under which the Governing Board may award a sole-source
contract: (1) cost to prepare documents exceeds the cost for consultants;
(2) delay would result in the endangerment of public health, (3)
services are only available from the sole source, (4) other circumstances
exist identifying the sole source as in the best interest of the
AQMD. This request for sole source award is being made under provision
(4). ARB will be the contractor and manager for this project.
As an agency, it has had extensive experience in managing and
administering projects involving heavy-duty vehicle emissions
testing and emissions inventory development. This experience makes
ARB particularly well-suited for this project. ARB is responsible
for the State emissions inventory and emissions modeling associated
with its development and, in this capacity, is uniquely qualified
to manage this project which could ultimately shape the HDV portion
of the inventory.
<P>
Data resulting from this project could lead to a more accurate
HDV emissions inventory for the South Coast Air Basin, directly
benefiting the AQMD's emissions modeling and control measurement
development efforts. Also, by providing co-funding for this project,
the AQMD will participate in all administrative and technical
aspects, including review of responses received to an RFP which
will precede the ARB's award of a contract for this work, selection
of a contractor to complete work specified under the contract,
reviewing all deliverables, and meeting regularly with ARB staff
and representatives from other contractors involved with this
project.
<P>
California State law (Public Contract Code, Section 10115 et seq.
and Title 2, California Code of Regulations, Section 1896.60 et
seq.) requires that &quot;goals of participation&quot; involving
Minority, Women, and Disabled Veteran Business Enterprises be
met for each contract entered into by and between the State and
outside contractor(s). The minimum percentages of participation
that must be obtained for this contract are: Minority Business
Enterprises (15%), Women Business Enterprises (5%), and Disabled
Veteran Business Enterprises (3%). Bidders that will be considered
responsive to this requirement are those that either attain the
entire participation goal percentages, or provide sufficient documentation
to demonstrate that a sincere good-faith effort was made to attain
the goals.
<P>
<B>Resource Impacts</B> 
<P>
The total cost of the project is $850,000, with AQMD's co-sponsorship
amount not to exceed $200,000. At this time, the ARB intends to
provide the balance of funding for this project. Sufficient funds
are available in the Fiscal Year 1995-96 budget to fund this project.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>MAN:CNA</FONT>
<HR>

<P>
<B>Background</B> 
<P>
Off-road equipment powered by gasoline and liquefied petroleum
gas (LPG) engines of 25 to less than 175 horsepower contribute
significantly to the South Coast Air Basin baseline mobile source
emissions inventory. There currently are no emissions standards
for these engines and in the absence of controls, it is estimated
that this category will contribute 20 percent of the total reactive
organic gas (ROG) emissions to the Basin inventory in 2010.. The
State Implementation Plan (SIP) adopted by the AQMD and California
Air Resources Board (ARB) in 1994, includes control measures M11
and M12, which would reduce emissions from off-road equipment
powered by gasoline and LPG engines with 25 to less than 175 horsepower.
<P>
Closed-loop three-way catalyst (TWC) technology has been instrumental
in achieving dramatic reductions in hydrocarbons (HC), carbon
monoxide (CO), and nitrogen oxides (NOx) from passenger cars since
the early 1980s. Since many of the off-road engines targeted in
SIP control measures M11 and M12 are similar to, or derived from
early 1980s automobile engines, it may be possible to transfer
TWC technology to gasoline and LPG industrial equipment engines
for emissions control.
<P>
The ARB intends to release a request for proposals (RFP) to determine
the technical feasibility of utilizing closed-loop TWC technology
in off-road gasoline and LPG engine applications to meet the goals
established in SIP control measures M11 and M12. The proposed
project will consist of an assessment of technologies which could
be used to reduce exhaust emissions from gasoline and LPG engines
of 25 to less than 175 horsepower, with an emphasis on TWC technology,
and an evaluation of the potential of the identified technologies
to meet the emission reduction requirements set in the SIP. Following
this preliminary assessment, a prototype TWC-equipped gasoline/LPG
system will be developed and tested for durability of both the
engine and the emissions control system.
<P>
The proposed project is included in the Technology Advancement
Plan for the Clean Fuels Program MS-12, &quot;Development and
Demonstration of Low Emission, Alternative Fuel Technologies for
Off-Road Applications.&quot; One expected benefit of this project
is the proof-of-concept of TWC technology for off-road equipment
powered by gasoline and LPG engines, which could ultimately result
in direct reductions of exhaust HC, CO, and NOx.. In addition,
this project could assist in compliance with SIP control measures
M11 and M12.
<P>
<B>Sole Source Justification</B> 
<P>
Section II, Step 3(C) of the Consultant Selection Policy identifies
four provisions under which the Governing Board may award a sole-source
contract: (1) cost to prepare documents exceeds the cost for consultants;
(2) delay would result in the endangerment of public health, (3)
services are only available from the sole source, (4) other circumstances
exist identifying the sole source as in the best interest of the
AQMD. This request for sole source award is being made under provision
(4). ARB will be the primary contractor and will be responsible
for overall management of this project. Along with the U. S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA), the ARB has regulatory authority to establish
and implement emission standards for off-road engines and equipment.
In this capacity, the ARB has worked closely with the EPA and
off-road equipment and engine manufacturers and is well acquainted
with the industry and issues related to regulatory development.
<P>
As a lead agency for developing both on- and off-road equipment
and engine regulations, the ARB is well positioned to oversee
an evaluation of mobile source emission control technologies and,
if feasible, the transfer of on-road controls to off-road categories.
This ability is critical to the successful execution of this project.
In addition, the ARB has had extensive experience in managing
and administering projects involving off-road engine and equipment.
<P>
It is important that this project be funded because the transfer
of an effective on-road emission control technology to this currently
unregulated off-road category could shape future regulations which,
in turn, would provide a direct emissions benefit in the Basin.
In addition, TWC technology could potentially apply to LPG as
well as gasoline off-road equipment, promoting additional sales
penetration of LPG-fuel equipment in the Basin. By providing co-funding
for this project, the AQMD will participate in all administrative
and technical aspects, including review of an RFP which will precede
the ARB's award of a contract for this work, selection of a contractor
to complete work specified under the contract, reviewing all deliverables,
and meeting regularly with ARB staff and representatives from
other contractors involved with this project.
<P>
California State law (Public Contract Code, Section 10115 et seq.
and Title 2, California Code of Regulations, Section 1896.60 et
seq.) requires that &quot;goals of participation&quot; involving
Minority, Women, and Disabled Veteran Business Enterprises be
met for each contract entered into by and between the State and
outside contractor(s). The minimum percentages of participation
that must be obtained for this contract are: Minority Business
Enterprises (15%), Women Business Enterprises (5%), and Disabled
Veteran Business Enterprises (3%). Bidders that will be considered
responsive to this requirement are those that either attain the
entire participation goal percentages, or provide sufficient documentation
to demonstrate that a sincere good-faith effort was made to attain
the goals.
<P>
<B>Resource Impacts</B> 
<P>
The total cost of the project is $450,000, with AQMD's co-sponsorship
amount not to exceed $150,000. At this time, the ARB intends to
provide the $300,000 balance of funding for this project. Sufficient
funds are available in the Fiscal Year 1995-96 budget to fund
this project.

 Execute a Contract to Cost Share the Evaluation of Fuel Cell 
Reformer Emissions
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B>Synopsis:</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The AQMP calls for deployment of ZEVs. Under
current ARB definition, fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) with fuel reformers
cannot qualify as ZEVs. On a life-cycle emissions basis, however,
they are expected to be as clean as battery-powered EVs. ARB,
working closely with AQMD, issued an RFP for a study to quantify
emissions from FCVs with on-board reformers. The evaluation team
selected Acurex Environmental to conduct this $250,000 study.
Staff recommends executing a contract with ARB to provide an AQMD
cost share of $125,000.

<B>Background</B> 
<P>
The Low-Emission Vehicles and Clean Fuels (LEV/CF) regulation
adopted by ARB in September 1990 defines ZEVs as vehicles that
have zero emissions under any and all operational modes and conditions.
Both battery-powered EVs and pure-hydrogen fuel cell vehicles
will meet this definition. Fuel cell vehicles that use on-board
reformers to generate hydrogen from a carbon-based fuel (e.g.,
methanol) are extremely low emitting, but cannot be considered
ZEVs under the current definition. However, ARB is considering
the appropriateness of establishing &quot;ZEV-equivalent&quot;
emission standards for non-ZEVs, using power plant emissions from
recharging battery EVs as the baseline. This action may allow
reformer-equipped fuel cell vehicles to qualify as ZEV-equivalent
in the future, thereby providing additional incentive for vehicle
manufacturers to commercialize them.
<P>
In August 1995, working closely with AQMD and DOE, ARB issued
an RFP entitled &quot;Evaluation of Fuel Cell Reformer Emissions.&quot;
This RFP solicited a technical contractor to assess the emissions
produced from fuel cell vehicles with on-board fuel reformers.
ARB received two proposals in response to the RFP, but only one
-- submitted by Acurex Environmental Corporation -- was found
to be compliant. The Acurex proposal was sufficiently strong to
be selected for contract award by the RFP evaluation panel, consisting
of technical staff from ARB, AQMD, and DOE. ARB's Research Screening
Committee (RSC), which includes senior-level AQMD members, subsequently
recommended award of the contract to Acurex. At its January 25,
1996 meeting, ARB formally approved the RSC's recommendation.
This two-year project will assist ARB and AQMD in determining
if fuel cell vehicles with reformers can be categorized as ZEV-equivalent,
in the event that ARB adopts changes in the current ZEV definition.
<P>
<B>Proposal</B> 
<P>
Four major tasks will be performed by the technical contractor
in this study. Task 1 will be a comprehensive engineering assessment
of fuel cell technologies and fuel reformers. In Task 2, the contractor
will conduct case studies of reformer emissions using simulation
models that are representative of real-world driving scenarios.
These models will address various combinations of fuel cells,
reformer technologies, and fuels (including methanol, ethanol,
natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, gasoline, and diesel). In
Task 3, actual emissions testing will be performed on a reformer-equipped
fuel cell vehicle. In Task 4, the contractor will prepare a final
report that will include complete results of the simulation models
and emissions testing program. Correlations will be made between
emissions and operational parameters in the fuel cell and vehicle
systems. Emissions durability factors will be carefully assessed
and reported on.
<P>
This proposed project is included in the Technology Advancement
Plan for the Clean Fuels Program as Project MS-05, &quot;Assessment
of Emissions from Fuel Cell Reformers.&quot; The expected benefits
of this project are that a quantification of emission levels from
fuel cell vehicles will help establish future emission inventories
and standards, and may stimulate vehicle manufacturers to accelerate
related commercialization efforts.
<P>
<B>Sole Source Justification</B> 
<P>
Section II, Step C(3) of the Consultant Selection Policy and Procedure
identifies four provisions under which a sole-source bid may be
justified: (1) cost to prepare documents exceeds cost for consultant,
(2) delay would result in the endangerment of public health, (3)
services are only available from sole source, and (4) other circumstances
exist identifying sole source as in the best interests of the
AQMD. This request for a sole-source bid is made under provision
(4). The proposed project involves a unique study in which ARB
is providing 50% of the funding along with administrative and
technical oversight. ARB's technical contractor for the project,
Acurex Environmental, was selected through a competitive bid process
in which AQMD staff were directly involved. The Acurex proposal
was fully compliant with ARB's subcontracting requirement for
minority-owned businesses (15%), women-owned businesses (5%),
and California disabled-veteran-owned businesses (3%).
<P>
<B>Resource Impacts</B> 
<P>
As specified in the RFP, the total cost of the proposed project
is estimated to be $250,000. ARB has requested that AQMD match
its funding on a one-to-one basis by contributing $125,000. The
DOE will contribute in-kind support and technical expertise to
the project. Sufficient funds are available in the FY 1995-1996
Budget.

 Execute a Contract to Cost-Share the Development
and Demonstration of a Propane Medium-Duty Engine
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B>Synopsis:</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Medium-duty vehicle applications, such as street
sweepers, shuttle buses and pickup and delivery trucks, lend themselves
well to the use of alternative fuels. Although there are several
natural gas engines available in the marketplace, there are no
commercially-available propane-fueled medium-duty engines. Staff
recommends cosponsoring, in an amount not to exceed $313,400,
The ADEPT Group to develop and demonstrate a propane Cummins 6B
engine in a shuttle bus application with the City of Pasadena.
The total estimated cost of the project is about $2.5 million.

<P>
<B>Background</B> 
<P>
Propane, or liquefied petroleum gas, is the most prevalent and
easily obtained alternative fuel in the United States. Many light-duty
cars and trucks have been converted to operate on propane. Yet,
in spite of the general acceptance of propane as a fuel, and its
existing fueling infrastructure, engine manufacturers have been
slow to develop low-emission propane medium- and heavy-duty engine
technologies. Currently no certified propane engines are manufactured
in the medium- and heavy-duty categories. Under AQMD contract
number S-C94147, The ADEPT Group (ADEPT), in conjunction with
Detroit Diesel Corporation (DDC), is currently developing a heavy-duty
propane engine suitable for transit applications.
<P>
<B>Proposal</B> 
<P>
ADEPT has a proposed project to develop and demonstrate a Cummins
B Series medium-duty propane engine to complement heavy-duty propane
engine development under the above-referenced AQMD contract. This
engine has applications in street sweepers, shuttles, pickup and
delivery vehicles and other medium-duty vehicles. Cummins Engine
Company (Cummins) has previously developed the B Series for natural
gas operation. That engine was certified by the Air Resources
Board as meeting ultra-low emission vehicle (ULEV) standards for
medium-duty engines and vehicles. The proposed project is intended
to lead to certification of a Cummins B Series propane engine
to ULEV standards.
<P>
The proposed development and demonstration project includes host
sites in Texas, California and Canada. The City of Pasadena is
the proposed California host site. ADEPT intends to install the
B Series propane engine in one bus from the existing shuttle bus
fleet, and purchase a new bus with the second demonstration engine.
Upon completion of the demonstration phase, Cummins intends to
make its B Series propane engine commercially available in the
Basin.
<P>
This proposed project is included in the Technology Advancement
Plan for the Clean Fuels Program as Project MS-06, &quot;Development
and Demonstration of a Propane Medium-Duty Engine&quot;. The expected
benefits of this project are direct emission reductions during
the demonstration period. The project goal is ULEV medium-duty
engine and vehicle certification, which is 2.5g/bhp-hr for NOx
and NMHC, 0.05 g/bhp-hr for PM, and 15.5 g/bhp-hr for CO. If successfully
demonstrated, the resulting certified ULEV engine will become
commercially available for various uses in Southern California
with commensurate emission benefits.
<P>
<B>Sole Source Justification</B> 
<P>
Section II, Step 3(C) of the Consultant Selection Policy and Procedure
identifies four provisions under which the Executive Officer may
award a sole-source bid: (1) cost to prepare documents exceeds
cost for consultant, (2) delay would result in the endangerment
of public health, (3) services are only available from sole-source,
(4) other circumstances exist identifying sole-source as in the
best interests of the AQMD. This request for sole-source bid is
made under provision #4. It is in the AQMD's best interests to
enter into a costshare agreement with The ADEPT Group for demonstration
of propane in medium-duty applications, leveraging $313,400 in
AQMD funds into an approximately $2.5 million development and
demonstration program.
<P>
The AQMD will be part of a North American propane engine development
and demonstration project, which includes three host sites, two
propane suppliers, three chassis manufacturers, and an engine
manufacturer. Cummins has been a leader in the commercialization
of low-emission natural gas medium- and heavy-duty engines. Their
B Series engine is very popular in shuttle buses and smaller delivery
vehicles. The ADEPT Group, Inc., was selected by Cummins, the
host sites, and the fuel suppliers to manage this program. ADEPT,
an engineering consulting firm with experience managing alternative
fuel, heavy-duty vehicle demonstrations is a small business located
in the Basin. In the recent past, they have worked with DDC on
biodiesel and propane engine technologies in transit buses. They
have also performed evaluations of diesel engine combustion chamber
modifications as an emission reduction strategy and have performed
a number of studies related to the use of natural gas in the mobile
sector.

 Execute a Contract to Cost-Share the Development
and Demonstration of a Long-Range Natural-Gas Van
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B>Synopsis:</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Certain manufacturers have developed low-emission
vehicles fueled by automotive compressed natural gas (CNG). However,
because of space constraints for the CNG tanks, these vehicles
are limited in range to about half that of gasoline vehicles.
CALSTART proposes to develop a modified frame structure for the
Dodge Ram Van to incorporate larger CNG storage tanks and double
the vehicle range. The total estimated cost of this project is
$750,000. Staff recommends that a contract with CALSTART be executed
for an amount not to exceed $100,000.

<P>
<B>Background</B> 
<P>
The Air Quality Management Plan emphasizes the use of alternative
fuels throughout the transportation sector as an air-quality attainment
strategy. In addition, the Federal Energy Policy Act requires
the use of alternative fuels by vehicle fleets to reduce the need
for importing petroleum products. In response, some original-equipment
manufacturers (OEM) have developed low-emission vehicles fueled
by compressed natural gas (CNG). However, because of space constraints
for the CNG tanks, these vehicles are limited in range to about
half that of equivalent gasoline vehicles. This limits the appeal
and marketability of these low-emission vehicles.
<P>
<B>Proposal</B> 
<P>
CALSTART has proposed to develop and demonstrate a long-range
CNG Dodge Ram Van. The base vehicle was certified by the Air Resources
Board to Ultra-Low-Emission-Vehicle (ULEV) standards, but only
has only a range of 175 miles. NGV/USA, Incorporated, conducted
a $142,000 Phase-I engineering study of this vehicle that was
sponsored by Atlanta Gas Light Company, Chrysler Corporation,
Columbia Gas of Ohio, Gas Research Institute, Pacific Gas and
Electric Company, and Southern California Gas Company. This study
determined that it is feasible to modify the frame rails of the
CNG Dodge van and efficiently incorporate larger CNG storage tanks.
This modification will not substantially reduce the payload, strength
nor structural rigidity of the van, and it will extend the range
to 350 miles.
<P>
In Phase II, CALSTART proposes to finalize the modification design,
fabricate a prototype CNG van, and extensively road test this
prototype. First, computer modeling will be performed to simulate
collisions and evaluate other failure modes. Chrysler will also
review the design and recommend changes to improve manufacturability.
A prototype replacement chassis will then be fabricated using
special construction jigs and fixtures. A standard CNG Dodge Van
will have its original chassis replaced by the prototype chassis,
and larger CNG cylinders will be installed. Finally, a battery
of dynamic road tests will be performed to evaluate the long-range
design. Phase II has a total cost of $750,000.
<P>
This proposed project is included in the Technology Advancement
Plan for the Clean Fuels Program as Project MS-07, &quot;Development
and Demonstration of a Long-Range Natural-Gas Van.&quot; The expected
benefits of this project are a general &quot;proof-of-concept&quot;
demonstration and potential emission reductions if this technology
is commercialized and the number of CNG vehicles increases.
<P>
<B>Sole-Source Justification</B> 
<P>
Section II, Step 3(C) of the Consultant Selection Policy identifies
four provisions under which the Governing Board may award a sole-source
contract: (1) cost to prepare documents exceeds the cost for consultants,
(2) delay would result in the endangerment of public health, (3)
services are only available from sole-source, and (4) other circumstances
exist identifying sole-source as in the best interest of the AQMD.
This request for sole-source award is being made under provision
(4). CALSTART, headquartered in Burbank, California, was created
with the help of the AQMD to establish an advanced transportation
industry in California. To date, CALSTART has had extensive experience
managing alternative-fuel-vehicle development projects including
electric, hybrid-electric and CNG vehicle projects.
<P>
CALSTART has developed an innovative and unique clean-fuels project
to design, fabricate, test and demonstrate a long-range natural-gas
Dodge Ram Van. This van will then become more attractive in the
market place and be sold in greater volumes. This van will reduce
emissions compared to the gasoline version by more than 50%. CALSTART
has assembled an exceptionally qualified team to develop and demonstrate
a long-range natural-gas van for near-term implementation and
air quality benefit. This team shall consist of the following:
<UL>
<LI>NGV/USA, the prime subcontractor, is a small business located
in Los Angeles, California. It has developed the proprietary technology
that will allow greater on-board storage of CNG and increased
vehicle range. NGV/USA conducted the Phase-I engineering study,
will finalize the system design, and will manage the project.
<BR>

<LI>Metalcrafters, Incorporated, of Fountain Valley, California,
will build the prototype CNG van and fabricate the necessary tooling.
Metalcrafters is a qualified vehicle upfitter that builds development
vehicles for the domestic OEM. <BR>

<LI>Chrysler Corporation, an OEM, will contribute the test vehicle
and provide fuel-system and structural specifications for this
project. If successful, Chrysler will consider incorporating the
new frame-tank design on future CNG Dodge Ram Vans.
</UL>

<P>
As noted below, CALSTART has obtained 87% cost-sharing for this
project from the team members and natural-gas utilities. For these
reasons, it is in the best interest of the AQMD to award a sole-source
contract to CALSTART.

 Execute a Contract to Evaluate Allergens in Paved
Road Dust and Airborne Particles
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B>Synopsis:</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The objective of this proposed study is to determine
the contribution of road dust to the toxicity of ambient particles
(PM10). The information can subsequently be used to determine
the extent of health benefits likely to be derived from road dust
control measures to achieve ambient PM10 target levels in different
areas of the Basin. Staff recommends cosponsoring this study by
the California Institute of Technology in an amount not to exceed
$50,000. The California Air Resources Board will provide $104,000
to cost-share this study.

<P>
<B>Background</B> 
<P>
The South Coast Air Basin is required to attain the National Ambient
Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for fine particulate matter (PM10)
by the year 2006. In urban areas, road dust accounts for 30-50%
of ambient PM10 levels. A recent study suggests that the latex
(derived from wear and tear of tires) portion in road dust is
probably responsible for the observed increase of asthma incidence
in the general population. However, neither the toxic effects
of road dust, nor the allergenic potential of the latex portion
(likely to cause or exacerbate asthma) have been established.
Hence, the extent of public health benefits likely to be derived
from controlling road dust cannot be estimated.
<P>
<B>Proposal</B> 
<P>
The proposed study will characterize the major allergens found
in both road dust and ambient air samples of PM10, and will estimate
the road dust contributions to ambient PM10 levels. Ambient air
samples will be collected over a period of six months at three
monitoring sites (Long Beach, Los Angeles and Rubidoux). Paved
road dust samples will also be collected from areas adjacent to
these monitoring sites. Both will be analyzed for their chemical
composition and for allergenic potential in humans.
<P>
Organic and elemental carbon content will be determined by thermal
evolution and combustion analysis; sulfates, nitrates and chloride
by ion chromatography; sodium, calcium and magnesium levels by
atomic adsorption spectrophotometry; and trace elements by X-ray
fluorescence. These chemical composition results will be used
to estimate the contribution of road dust to ambient PM10 levels
by using a chemical mass balance (CMB) model.
<P>
State-of-the-science immunological techniques will be used to
quantify allergens in the samples collected. The technique is
based on a competitive reaction where an unknown amount of allergens
(antigens in the samples collected) compete with a known amount
of known labeled allergens to bind with a fixed amount of antibodies.
The more the environmental allergen, the less labeled allergen
can bind to the antibody. Following binding, the quantity of labeled
allergen-antibody combinations is measured and the amount of unknown
is calculated by the difference. Western blot techniques will
be used to screen and identify the types of allergens found in
the collected samples.
<P>
The expected benefit of the proposed is an improved understanding
of the potential health effects of PM10. The results of these
assays, coupled with the source contribution information gained
by the CMB analysis, will provide considerable insight to determine
the relative toxicity of road dust. This information will also
be critical to decide whether significant health benefit is likely
to be derived from targeting this fraction for future control
measures in efforts to attain the PM10 NAAQS.
<P>
<B>Sole-Source Justification</B> 
<P>
Section II, Step C(3) of the Consultant Selection Policy identifies
four provisions under which a sole-source award may be justified;
(1) cost to prepare documents exceeds the cost for consultants,(2)
delay would result in the endangerment of public health or property,
(3) services are only available from the sole-source, (4) other
circumstances exist identifying the sole-source as in the best
interests of the AQMD. This request for a sole-source award is
being made under provision #4. The contractor was selected by
the California Air Resources Board (ARB), which is providing over
two thirds ($104,256) of the funds to conduct the study. The costs
associated with daily monitoring at multiple sites are prohibitive
to consider a similar study at a later time. However, ambient
samples are being collected at no additional costs by the ongoing
enhanced PM10 monitoring program at the AQMD. Hence, joining the
ARB to cosponsor this study by providing $50,000 from the AQMD
will result in considerable cost savings in an effort to obtain
critical information for designing future control strategies.
<P>
Thus, it is in the AQMD's best interest to fund this study for
evaluating allergens in paved road dust and air borne particles
in an effort to design future control strategies which will provide
maximum health benefits to the Basin's residents.
<P>
<B>Resource Impacts</B> 
<P>
The total cost of the proposed project is $154,256. The ARB will
contribute $104,256 and has requested a $50,000 cost share from
the AQMD to fund this project. Sufficient funds are available
in the Advanced Technology Fund to support this project.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Adopt Technology Advancement Plan and include
it in the Clean Fuels Program
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B>Synopsis:</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The proposed Technology Advancement Plan for
the Clean Fuels Program outlines planned project expenditures
for the balance of Fiscal Year 1995-96 in accord with SB 199 (Kelley).
This legislation includes a requirement that research, development,
and demonstration projects for vehicle applications within the
AQMD's Clean Fuels Program do not duplicate the efforts of 69
different organizations. Based on communications with these organizations,
staff has determined that the projects proposed in the Plan are
not duplicative. The Plan will be updated periodically to reflect
new developments.

Adopt the attached Technology Advancement Plan and include it
in the Clean Fuels Program. Find that the Technology Advancement
Plan and its proposed projects do not duplicate any past or present
programs of specified organizations.

<P>
<B>Background</B> 
<P>
Achieving federal and state clean air standards in Southern California
will require emission reductions from both mobile and stationary
sources beyond those available from current technologies. The
AQMP relies on the expedited, future implementation of advanced
technologies and clean-burning fuels in Southern California to
achieve these standards. To meet the needs of the AQMP for progressively
lower-emitting fuels and technologies, the AQMD adopted a Clean
Fuels Program in 1988, and also established the Technology Advancement
Office to administer the program. Concurrently, the State Legislature
authorized funds for the AQMD's Clean Fuels Program via SB 2297,
and subsequently renewed this funding authorization via SB 316.
<P>
The primary goal of the Clean Fuels Program is to assist private
industry in the rapid development and deployment of progressively
lower-emitting technologies and fuels. Since the program's inception
in 1988, AQMD has cosponsored more than 250 projects involving
low- and zero-emission technologies. Funding partners in the program
have included private industry, technology developers, academic
institutions, research institutes, and government agencies such
as ARB and EPA. This public-private partnership has enabled the
AQMD to leverage its public funds with outside investment in a
ratio of more than $4 of outside funding to every $1 of AQMD funding.
Staff has used the AQMP and the annual budget planning process
as guides for the expenditure of Clean Fuels Program revenues.
This facilitates a dynamic project-selection process that can
readily adjust to rapid advancements in clean technologies and
fuels.
<P>
State legislation, under Health and Safety Code (H&amp;SC) 40448.5
and Vehicle Code 9250.11, enables the AQMD to fund this program
through the imposition of a $1 annual fee on motor vehicles registered
in the counties of Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, and San Bernardino.
In 1993, SB 316 (Rosenthal) amended the legislation to extend
the Clean Fuels Program from an effective end date of August 1,
1994 to August 1, 1999. This bill also added constraints on the
AQMD in the administration and use of Clean Fuels Program revenues,
primarily to restrict the use of motor vehicle revenues to mobile
source applications.
<P>
The most recent amendments to the Clean Fuels Program resulted
from the passage of SB 199 (Kelley) in October 1995. This bill
imposes additional administrative requirements upon the AQMD under
H&amp;SC 40448.5.1. First, prior to any Clean Fuels Program expenditure
after January 1, 1996, a plan must be adopted that describes the
expected cost and benefits of proposed projects. Second, the AQMD
must coordinate its program with 69 different organizations to
find that expenditures are not duplicative. SB 199 does not preclude
jointly funded projects. Finally, a public report must be issued
within 120 days after a funded project is completed that includes
results achieved, actual and expected costs, and actual and expected
benefits.
<P>
<B>Proposal</B> 
<P>
The attached Technology Advancement Plan (the Plan) represents
the initial submittal of a formal plan as required by SB 199 (H&amp;SC
40448.5.1.(a)(1)). The Plan includes an overview of the AQMD's
technology advancement program, project planning and selection
processes, and proposed project areas being considered for co-funding
for the balance of Fiscal Year 1995-96. The proposed projects
are summarized, including objectives, expected costs, and expected
benefits, as required by SB 199. This plan will be updated periodically
to be as responsive as possible to technological advances.
<P>
Not all projects identified in the Plan are expected to be recommended
for funding. Each month, projects in the Plan that are deemed
to be ready will be presented individually to the Governing Board
for review and approval. At that time, additional details will
be provided about the technology to be demonstrated, the intended
application, the proposed scope of work, the capabilities of the
selected contractor and project team, and how the project will
be cost shared among various entities.
<P>
Based on communications with all of the organizations specified
in SB 199 and review of their programs, the projects proposed
in the Plan do not appear to duplicate any past or present projects.
As each individual project is recommended to the Board for funding,
staff will continue to communicate with these organizations to
ensure that duplication is avoided.

<P>
<B>Background</B> 
<P>
At its February 1996 meeting, the Governing Board directed staff
to prepare for release a Request for Quotations (RFQ) for car
scrapping. The quotations would be used to develop a qualified
list of car scrappers eligible for Air Quality Investment Program
(AQIP) funds.
<P>
The quotation will be used to identify and qualify service providers
capable of implementing old-vehicle scrapping and obtain mobile
source emission reduction credits (MSERC) pursuant to Rule 1610
- Old-Vehicle Scrapping. Vendors selected as a result of this
RFQ process will be recommended to the Governing Board for placement
on a old-vehicle scrapping qualification list that will be active
for eighteen months. The AQMD <B>may or may not</B> ultimately
seek the services of these vendors depending on future AQMD needs.
<P>
The AQIP is one of the compliance options available under Rule
2202 - On-Road Motor Vehicle Mitigation Options. Employers subject
to the rule may elect to participate in the AQIP by investing
the designated amount and be deemed in compliance with the rule.
The AQIP is an AQMD administered restricted fund. The AQMD has
the responsibility to utilize the funds in the AQIP to obtain
emission reductions in a cost-effective manner. Old-vehicle scrapping
is currently among the most cost-effective mobile source emission
reduction strategies available. Therefore, the AQMD seeks to obtain
a list of qualified car scrappers that will be used to obtain
equivalent emission reductions for the participating employers
in the AQIP in the event that car scrapping is selected among
competing projects.

<B>Background</B> 
<P>
On March 9, 1995, negotiations were initiated between AQMD and
the San Bernardino Public Employees Association, representing
the Professional Bargaining Unit, to bargain a successor agreement
to the two parties' July 1, 1994 - June 30, <I>1995 Memorandum
of Understanding</I> (<I>MOU</I>). After seventeen bargaining
sessions over an eight-month period failed to produce agreement,
the two sides jointly declared negotiations to be at impasse.
As required under provisions of AQMD's <I>Employee Relations Resolution</I>,
a mediator from the California Mediation and Conciliation Service
was called in to assist with the process.
<P>
During the course of mediation, tentative agreement was reached
to implement, for Professional Unit employees, effective May 1,
1996, the same Tuesday-through-Friday work week established earlier
for the rest of the work force and to extend all other provisions
of the earlier <I>MOU</I> through June 30, 1996. Management tentatively
agreed to make temporary accommodations for employees for whom
the new work week would create verifiable hardships relating to
child care or school scheduling arrangements made in expectation
of a different work schedule. These employees would have until
July 1, 1996, to resolve personal scheduling problems. By July
1 all employees would be expected to be on the Tuesday-through-Friday
work week, unless management, to meet operational needs, designates
an alternative schedule for individual employees.

<P>
<B>Background</B> 
<P>
On March 13, 1995, negotiations were initiated between AQMD and
the Federation of Public Sector Workers (Federation), representing
the Technical and Enforcement and Office Clerical and Maintenance
Units, to bargain a successor agreement to the two parties' July
1, 1994 - June 30, <I>1995 Memorandum of Understanding</I> (<I>MOU</I>).
After seventeen bargaining sessions over an eight-month period
failed to produce agreement, the two sides jointly declared negotiations
to be at impasse. As required under provisions of AQMD's <I>Employee
Relations Resolution</I>, a mediator from the California Mediation
and Conciliation Service was called in to assist with the process.
During the course of mediation, a petition, signed by sixty-six
percent of Office Clerical and Maintenance Unit employees, was
submitted by the California Teamsters Public, Professional and
Medical Employees Union Local 911 to decertify the Federation
as the Unit's exclusive representative. Legal Counsel advised
negotiations with that Unit could not proceed. Mediation continued,
however, with the Technical and Enforcement Unit, and a tentative
agreement was reached, which was later ratified by the membership
of the Unit.
<P>
Among the terms of this ratified agreement, are new vehicle assignment
criteria aimed at assuring vehicles are more efficiently used
for AQMD business. In implementing these more restrictive criteria,
management agreed to provide those who lose vehicles a one-time
transitional allowance of $150 per month to a maximum of $900.
Other contract provisions include establishment of a catastrophic
leave fund, funded by deposit of one-half of employees' earned
vacation leave that would otherwise be forfeited; an administratively
more efficient grievance process; a 10-day limit on paid jury
duty leave; an option for employees to purchase, at their expense,
up to forty hours of additional vacation annually, to be used
with management approval; a one-year probationary period for all
newly hired employees; agreement to conduct a classification study
of positions in the inspector class series; changes relating to
employee parking and rideshare policy provisions; changes to enhance
administrative efficiency in tracking sick leave usage; and changes
that keep performance rating as a factor in determining layoffs
and reductions in classification, but restrict the time period
for receipt of ratings and add options for reducing to lower classifications.
Complete texts of contract changes are included in the attachments
to this letter. The contract extends all other provisions of the
earlier <I>MOU</I> through June 30, 1996.
<P>
<B>Resource Impacts</B> 
<P>
It is anticipated the costs associated with this labor contract,
almost exclusively those associated with the one-time transition
allowance for those required to give up vehicles under the stricter
assignment criteria, will be balanced out by budgetary savings
in fleet maintenance and for paid jury duty leaves, increases
in administrative efficiencies, and other, less tangible benefits
associated with this contract.

 Lead Agency Projects and Environmental Documents Received by the AQMD
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B>Synopsis:</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 This report provides for the Governing Board's
consideration a listing of California Environmental Quality Act
(CEQA) documents received by the South Coast Air Quality Management
District (AQMD) between January 4, 1996 and February 1, 1996,
and those projects for which the AQMD is acting as lead agency
pursuant to CEQA.

<P>
<B>Background</B> 
<P>
<B>EIR and Document Log (Attachments A and B)</B> - Each month,
the AQMD receives numerous CEQA documents from other public agencies
on projects which could adversely affect air quality. Listings
of all documents received for review are contained in Attachments
A and B. Monthly listings which are shaded note those CEQA documents
for which the AQMD staff has or will prepare and submit comments
to the lead agency. A list of active projects from previous months
for which AQMD staff is continuing to evaluate or prepare comments
is included as Attachment B. A column has been added to the tables
in Attachments A and B of this report in response to Board member
request. The column captioned &quot;Public Concerns&quot; identifies
parties who have contacted the AQMD with concerns or issues about
the proposed project. A notation of 1 in this column indicates
the contact was supportive of the project noted. A notation of
2 indicates the party was opposed or expressed concerns about
the project. A notation of 3 indicates that no one contacted the
AQMD about that project.
<P>
In the past, AQMD staff routinely reviewed many of these documents
and commented upon the air quality analyses and possible impacts
on the air quality of the district. Due to staffing constraints,
the AQMD is no longer able to routinely comment on all CEQA documents
received. Publication of the Board-approved <I>CEQA Air</I> <I>Quality
Handbook</I>, however, has provided local governments and other
public agencies with the necessary information to prepare appropriate
air quality analyses on projects for which they act as lead agency.
As resources permit, staff evaluates and may prepare comments
for projects that may have significant adverse regional air quality
impacts (e.g., special event centers, landfills, etc.) and those
projects for which a lead or responsible agency has specifically
requested AQMD review.
<P>
<B>AQMD Lead Agency Projects (Attachment C)</B> - Pursuant to
CEQA, the AQMD periodically acts as lead agency on stationary
source permit projects. Under CEQA the lead agency is responsible
for determining whether an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) or
a Negative Declaration is necessary for any proposal considered
to be a &quot;project&quot; as defined by CEQA. An EIR is prepared
when the AQMD as lead agency finds substantial evidence that the
proposed project may have a significant adverse effect on the
environment. A Negative Declaration may be prepared if the AQMD
determines that the proposed project will not generate significant
adverse environmental impacts. The Negative Declaration is a written
statement describing the reasons a proposed project will not have
a significant adverse effect on the environment and, therefore,
does not require the preparation of an EIR.
<P>
Attachment C to this report summarizes the active projects for
which the AQMD is lead agency and is currently preparing or has
prepared environmental documentation. As noted in Attachment C,
during January 1996, the AQMD continued working on CEQA documents
for four (4) active projects.
<P>
In 1995, the AQMD, as lead agency, prepared or contracted for
the preparation of and certified four (4) CEQA documents. No lead
agency CEQA documents have been certified so far in 1996.

Attachment - Rule Forecast Report<HR>

<P>
This month this report is presented as a companion to agenda number
28. Under that agenda item the Board will consider a public hearing
to seek EPA approval for the inclusion of the 1994 AQMP and SIP
submittal into the State Implementation Plan. This report, as
distinguished from agenda item 28, includes all rules proposed
for adoption in 1996, not just those that are part of the SIP.
The 1996 Rule Forecast Report contains approximately 28 rules
which are administrative and a combination of 51 rules and control
measures which reduce emissions.

<P>
<B>Administrative Committee Discussion Items:</B> 
<OL>
<LI><U><I>Operation of Board Committees in the Absence of a Committee
Majority</I></U><I>:</I> Legislative Committee Member Hugh Hewitt
raised issues regarding Board-adopted policy pertaining to Committee
voting. General Counsel Peter Greenwald advised that it has never
been the Board's practice, nor has it ever been required, that
a committee majority be present to conduct business and take action
on matters before the Committee. Mr. Greenwald further advised
that no formal procedures or bylaws have been established by the
Governing Board regarding meetings of standing Board Committees.
Chairman Mikels requested that the issue of Committee procedures
be brought to the full Board for clarification and possible action.
In addition, due to these issues raised by Mr. Hewitt, the Legislative
Committee did not convene. Therefore, Chairman Mikels requested
that the entire legislative committee agenda be placed on the
March 8, 1996 Governing Board agenda for consideration and action.
Chairman Mikels further advised that additional legislative issues
would be placed before the Board as positions are sought relative
to interim bills introduced by the Legislature pending the March
8, 1996 meeting; and,
<LI><U><I>Board Assistant Contracts</I></U><I>:</I> The Committee
considered and recommended approval of the proposed compensation
and contract for Councilmember Candace Haggard's Board Consultant
(employee status), Elena Camaras. In addition, the Committee considered
and recommended approval of a modification regarding the contract
for Chairman Mikels' Assistant, Daniela Fernandez, to cover reimbursement
for travel and mileage.

<B>Minutes</B> 
<P>
The minutes of the January 25, 1996, monthly meeting were approved,
as submitted, and are provided for your information as <I>Attachment
1</I>. In addition, the MSRC received its November 9, 1995, meeting
minutes, but postponed approval until its next meeting to allow
for more sufficient review of these lengthy minutes which include
adoption of their FY 1995-97 Work Program. These <B>draft/unapproved</B>
minutes are also provided for your information (<I>Attachment
2)</I>.
<P>
<B>Supplement to Fiscal Year 1995-97 AB 2766 Discretionary Fund
Work Program</B> 
<P>
Because of an unprecedented amount of turn-back funds in excess
of $2 million, higher interest income than projected, and a delay
in the schedule of several high-priced contracts, the MSRC has
identified at least $5 million for a supplement to the Fiscal
Year 1995-97 AB 2766 Discretionary Fund Work Program. The MSRC's
Lessons Learned Subcommittee, on which I have been participating
periodically, has been formulating this supplement to the Work
Program. Currently, the supplemental work program could consist
of the following five elements; 1) $600,000 for several innovative
programs, including bicycle transportation, market incentives,
and broad-based land-use training for elected officials; 2) $700,000
to augment the EV Corridor Communities Program; 3) $750,000 for
additional research and development projects; 4) $1.5 million
for heavy-duty vehicles, targeting refuse and interstate trucks,
excluding transit and school buses, with a $250,000 1-1 match
minimum; and $1.5 million for advanced battery demonstration projects,
possibly in partnership with the AQMD's Technology Advancement
Office and auto companies. The Lessons Learned Subcommittee may
be submitting its proposal to the MSRC as early as March, thus
the supplemental work program could be included on our April 12,
1996, Governing Board agenda for consideration.
<P>
<B>Zero-Emission Vehicle &quot;Quick Charge&quot; Program</B>

<P>
As part of the FY 1995-97 AB 2766 Discretionary Fund Work Program,
the MSRC developed a $7 million Zero-Emission Vehicle &quot;Quick
Charge&quot; Program, consisting of three parts: 1) an RFQ for
$5,000 buydown incentives ($6 million total); 2) an RFP for an
18-month appointment as the ZEV &quot;Quick Charge&quot; Outreach
Coordinator ($175,000); and 3) an RFP for a Corridor Communities
Program ($825,000). The buydown incentive RFQ was released in
early December 1995, and the Planning Center, with two subcontractors
(Battelle Memorial Institute and the Southern California Economic
Partnership), was brought on board as the Outreach Coordinator
for the ZEV &quot;Quick Charge&quot; Program. On February 22,
the MSRC approved the RFP for the Electric Vehicle Corridor Communities
Program which will assist communities in preparing for EVs by
testing the consumer market and demonstrating the infrastructure,
permitting process, and coordination necessary for the smooth
introduction of larger quantities of EVs. Approval of this RFP
for release has been included on our March 8, 1996, Governing
Board agenda, so I have not attached a copy to this report. The
Corridor Communities Program RFP closes in July 1996, and contract
recommendations will be submitted to us in September 1996.
<P>
<B>Sole-Source Award to the Southern California Association of
Governments for a Regional Transit Database Information Exchange
Project</B> 
<P>
As part of the FY 1995-97 AB 2766 Discretionary Fund Work Program,
the MSRC set aside $550,000 for a Regional Transit Database Information
Exchange project to facilitate the interagency exchange of transit
route and schedule information for all fixed route transit and
rail operations within the AQMD through the Internet or by making
one phone call. The project will be completed through a sole-source
award to the Southern California Association of Governments which
will act as project coordinator. Approval of this sole-source
contract has been included on our March 8, 1996, Governing Board
agenda for consideration.
<P>
<B>Concern Expressed by GeoChemical Engineering Regarding Rejection
of its R&amp;D Proposal During the FY 1995-97 Evaluation Process</B>

<P>
A proposer, GeoChemical Engineering, had its proposal rejected
during the FY 1995-97 evaluation process for being nonresponsive
to the criteria in the Research and Development RFP under which
it was applying for funds. Technical staff advised the evaluation
subcommittee that the proposal was not a &quot;new local application
of remote sensing devices for NOx and hydrocarbon measuring,&quot;
as required in the RFP criteria. GeoChemical disagrees. However,
legal counsel has determined that since no specified criteria
or grounds are enumerated either statutorily or in MSRC policies
and procedures heretofore adopted, the MSRC is not required to
reconsider the proposal, although it is not prohibited from doing
so either. Since it would be difficult to re-evaluate and re-score
this proposal after completion of the work program, without prejudicing
proposers already funded, the MSRC chose not to reconsider GeoChemical's
proposal. However, the MSRC decided to adjust its evaluation process
in future, such that all proposals will be evaluated if they meet
an initial screening process which merely checks that all parts
required have been included in the submittal.
<P>
<B>Contract Modification Requests</B> 
<P>
As recommended by its Technical Advisory Committee, the MSRC approved
the following contract modifications:
<OL>
<LI>Minor scope change and cost reallocations for Bicycle Commuter
Coalition of the Inland Empire Contract #C95005, which provides
$43,452 for a bicycle commuter project during National Bicycle
Appreciation Month;
<P>
<LI>In light of the merger of the Commuter Transportation Services
with the Southern California Association of Governments, a novation
(transfer) of Commuter Transportation Services Contract #C94035
to the Southern California Association of Governments, which provides
$87,000 for a parking cash-out study;
<P>
<LI>Four-month contractual term extension, and possible reduction
in the number of school bus conversions and contract costs on
City of Compton Contract #C94044, which provides $396,750 towards
the conversion of heavy-duty vehicles to CNG; and
<P>
<LI>Another novation of a CTS contract, #C94046, to SCAG, which
provides $160,000 for a Monrovia/Duarte Rideshare Program.
</OL>
<P>
The MSRC also denied a contractual term extension for Orange County
Transportation Authority's ISTEA contract, #C9401. When the MSRC
allocated $1,062,500 to each of the four county transportation
commissions in FY 1994-95, the contracts included strict language
which prohibited any extensions beyond August 1, 1996. Consequently,
for one of the projects within the ISTEA contract, the MSRC had
to deny a contractual term extension. However, the MSRC approved
a reallocation of funds towards hardware for a City of Tustin
project implemented by OCTA.
<P>
The MSRC also received and filed a report on &quot;Scope Changes
Handled Administratively by the AQMD Contract Administrator&quot;
for February which included two minor contract modifications for
Omnitrans Contract #C95014, which provides $952,725 towards the
purchase of 21 CNG vehicles, and City of Santa Clarita Contract
#C95020, which provides $30,000 for bus stop displays.
<P>
<B>Receipt and Approval of Final Report</B> 
<P>
The MSRC received and approved one final report for City of Santa
Monica Contract #C93028, which provided $34,000 toward the purchase
of electric vehicles. All final reports for the AB 2766 Discretionary
Program can be viewed in the District's Library.
<P>
<B>Contract Administrator Report</B> 
<P>
The MSRC's AB 2766 Contract Administrator provided a written status
report on all fiscal years. This Contract Administrator Report
is provided for your information (<I>Attachment 3)</I>.
<P>
<B>1996 Meeting Schedule</B> 
<P>
Since members of the MSRC also serve on the IAIC, the MSRC is
considering changing its meeting time from 1:30 to 2:30 p.m. to
immediately follow the IAIC which will be meeting from 1-2:30
p.m. the same day. The MSRC will continue to meet on the fourth
Thursday of every month.

 Analysis of AQMD Treasury Management Options
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B>Synopsis:</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 This report identifies and evaluates various
treasury management options available to the AQMD, including the
costs and benefits of implementing each option. Over the last
several months the Administrative Committee has been reviewing
AQMD's investment and cash management programs performed by the
County of Los Angeles. Based upon concerns highlighted by the
Orange County bankruptcy, the Administrative Committee has directed
staff to provide to the Board an objective comparison of the various
treasury management options available to the AQMD and the costs,
risks, and benefits associated with each recommendation.

<B>Background</B> 
<P>
Since the AQMD was created in 1977, the County of Los Angeles,
under a General Services Agreement, has provided the AQMD with
treasury management services which include the processing of payroll
and accounts payable warrants and the investment of the AQMD's
cash balances. AQMD's cash balances are currently held in eight
separate funds in trust with the County and are segregated for
accounting purposes from other funds maintained by the Treasurer
for Los Angeles County, cities, and other special districts. Prior
to September 1995, all AQMD funds held by the County Treasurer
were invested in the County's $7.0 billion Pooled Surplus Investment
Portfolio (PSIP). In September 1995, the AQMD directed the Los
Angeles County Treasurer to invest up to $20 million of the AQMD's
funds in the Local Agency Investment Fund (LAIF), which is a $8.0
billion pooled investment fund managed by the California State
Treasurer. As of December 31, 1995, the AQMD had $51.4 million
invested in the PSIP and $19.5 invested in LAIF.
<P>
<B>Policy Issues</B> 
<P>
The Administrative Committee has been evaluating the financial
risks to the AQMD because of its participation in the County's
PSIP should the County declare insolvency as a result of its budgetary
problems. At its December meeting the Administrative Committee
directed staff to report back to the full Board regarding the
costs and risks associated with the treasury management options
available to the AQMD.
<P>
The AQMD has received a reasoned analysis from outside legal counsel
regarding the bankruptcy risks to the AQMD funds invested in the
Los Angeles County PSIP. This analysis made a significant distinction
between the commingled funds in the PSIP and separate accounts
in a bankruptcy situation, and expressed that the risks to AQMD
funds invested in separate noncommingled investments would be
greatly reduced.
<P>
Based on this legal analysis and the attached report prepared
by outside financial advisors, staff has developed two recommended
treasury management options, each with different benefits and
costs, which are responsive to the varying degree of perceived
risk associated with Los Angeles County solvency. Both options
reduce the solvency risks associated with the AQMD's participation
in the County's PSIP by moving a significant portion of our investments
out of the County's commingled pool and taking a more active role
in the short-and-intermediate term investment market. Option I
is recommended if the Board perceives the solvency risk to be
low and Option II is recommended if the Board believes that the
risk is high.
<P>
<I><U>Option I: Los Angeles County Treasury Management</U></I> - preserves
the current benefits of low cost banking and investment services
with greater diversification, oversight and control. This option
proposes placing approximately 85% of our investments into separate
accounts outside of the PSIP (into LAIF and the County's Special
Purpose Investment Portfolio) to minimize commingling
<P>
<I><U>Option II - AQMD Treasury Management</U></I> - requires the appointment
of a new internal Treasurer, new expanded banking services, higher
oversight and control responsibilities, modest increase in investment
risk, potential of increased earnings and higher banking and investment
service costs. This option proposes maintaining short-term investments
in both the PSIP and LAIF, plus actively managing through an outside
portfolio manager an intermediate-term investment account.
<P>
It is important to note that the Los Angeles County PSIP currently
and historically has had a conservative Investment Policy and
Guidelines, a conservative investment program strategy and experienced
management and investment staff. The PSIP is the second largest
pooled investment program in California, exceeded only by the
Pooled Money Investment Account of the State of California. Because
of its size and conservative investment policy the PSIP provides
its participants a solid return from an investment program which
emphasizes safety and liquidity at low administrative cost. Both
recommended options include a continued modest level of participation
in the PSIP because of the safety and daily liquidity provided
by the PSIP to meet AQMD payroll and accounts payable demands.
<P>
<B>Resource Impacts</B> 
<P>
The two treasury management options recommended for Board consideration
carry additional costs of approximately $20,000 for Option I to
approximately $165,000 for Option II annually.

<B>Synopsis:</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The rescinding of Rule 1129 and proposed amendment of
the other coating rules are necessary to make AQMD rules consistent
with Section 41712 of the state Health and Safety Code which prohibits
local districts from enforcing or regulating volatile organic
compound (VOC) limits on aerosol coatings. In addition, the proposed
amendment of the definition of &quot;exempt compounds&quot; in
each rule will reference Rule 102 - Definition of Terms, to provide
a consistent definition between rules.

<P>
<B>Background</B>
<P>
Rule 1129 - Aerosol Coatings, and associated coating rule amendments
were adopted November 2, 1990, to reduce VOC emissions from aerosol
coatings. Subsequently, Dunn Edwards Corporation and two groups
of aerosol paint manufacturers each filed a lawsuit challenging
the Rule 1129 adoption and other amendments on numerous grounds.
While the Los Angeles County Superior Court ruled in favor of
the plaintiffs in July of 1991, suspending Rule 1129 and the associated
amendments, the AQMD prevailed in its appeal in May of 1993, allowing
the reinstatement.<BR>

<P>
In October of 1993, the state legislature adopted amendments to
the State Health and Safety Code Section 41712, requiring the
California Air Resources Board (CARB) to adopt an aerosol paint
regulation and prohibiting local districts from adopting and enforcing
local aerosol paint regulations. Subsequently, CARB adopted a
statewide Aerosol Coating Products Rule on March 23, 1995.<BR>

<P>
<B>Proposal</B>
<P>
To be consistent with state law, staff proposes to rescind Rule
1129 and to amend Rules 1106.1, 1107, 1113, 1128, 1130, 1145 and
1151 to exempt aerosol coating products (aerosol coating products
do not include aerosol adhesives.) Additionally, staff is proposing
language to adopt the CARB definition of &quot;aerosol coating
products&quot; in order to provide rule consistency with the recently-adopted
CARB Aerosol Coating Products Rule. Finally, staff proposes to
amend the definition of &quot;exempt compounds&quot; in each rule
to reference its definition in Rule 102 - Definition of Terms,
which already controls in the event of a conflict in the rules.
<BR>

<P>
The architectural coating industry has asked that the proposed
amendments to Rule <BR>
1113 - Architectural Coatings include an exemption for small containers
of one quart and smaller. Staff proposes to include such an amendment
with other amendments to Rule 1113 scheduled later this year.
The quart container exemption can not be considered by the Board
at the March 8, 1996 Board meeting because, unlike the proposed
amendments, it has emission impacts that would have to be evaluated
under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Staff recommends
that the Board rescind Rule 1129 and adopt the clarifying amendments
to the other coating rules now, to ensure public understanding
of applicable requirements.<BR>

<P>
Additionally, on August 21, 1990, the Superior Court of Los Angeles
County entered a judgment in the case <U>Dunn-Edwards Corporation,
et al. v. SCAQMD</U>. The judgment denied in part and granted
in part the petition for writ of mandate seeking to overturn certain
amendments to Rule 1113 adopted on February 2, 1990. As a result,
the AQMD was prevented from enforcing the amendments relating
to industrial maintenance coatings, lacquers, quick-dry enamels,
and quick-dry primers, sealers and undercoaters. Other amendments
adopted in February 1990 and prior rule provisions remain in effect
as specified in the attached Rule 1113 Notice. <BR>

<P>
<B>AQMP</B>
<P>
The proposed amendments have no impact on emissions, and are consistent
with the AQMP.<BR>

<P>
<B>CEQA &amp; Socioeconomic Analysis</B>
<P>
AQMD staff has reviewed the proposed project pursuant to state
CEQA Guidelines Section 15002(k)(1). The proposed recission implements
currently existing state law over which the AQMD has no discretionary
authority. Therefore, the project is exempt from the requirements
of CEQA pursuant to state CEQA Guidelines Section 15268. In addition,
the project does not have the potential to adversely impact the
environment and is exempt pursuant to state CEQA Guidelines section
15061(b)(3).<BR>

<P>
Due to the limited nature of the amendments, no socioeconomic
assessment is required. The amendments will not have any effect
on the cost of compliance with the amended rules.<BR>

<P>
Staff has reviewed the proposed rescinding of Rule 1129 and the
proposed amendments to Rules 1106.1, 1107, 1113, 1128, 1130, 1145,
and 1151, and has determined that they are exempt from the requirements
of CEQA, pursuant to State CEQA Guidelines Section 15061(b)(1)
and (b)(3). Therefore, a Notice of Exemption will be prepared
for the proposed amendments and will be filed with the county
clerks immediately following the adoption of the proposed amendments.

<B>PROPOSAL:</B><blockquote>Amend Rule 1610 - Old-Vehicle Scrapping<BR></blockquote>
<P>
<B>SYNOPSIS:</B> <blockquote>Proposed amendments regarding the destruction of engine
blocks are recommended to: 1) make Rule 1610 more flexible in
enabling antique and classic car enthusiasts to salvage engine
parts, and 2) provide added options for auto dismantlers to render
engines inoperable. The revised rule language would allow for
alternative methods to render the engine inoperable and would
allow the classic car enthusiasts to rebuild these engines to
their original emissions certification standards.<BR></blockquote>

<FONT SIZE=1>BRW:CSL:HH:DC<BR>
</FONT>
<BR>

<P>
<B>Background</B>
<P>
Rule 1610 was amended in September 1995 in part due
to concerns from classic car enthusiasts regarding the destruction
of engine blocks that could be used to potentially restore collectable
vehicles. Prior to the September 1995 amendment, engine block
destruction was specifically required in Rule 1610 to ensure that
engines from scrapped vehicles were not reused in existing vehicles
and thus continue to contribute to the South Coast Air Basin's
air quality problems. As an alternative to the engine block destruction
requirement, the September 1995 amendment allowed the destruction
of the pistons and the rendering of the cylinder head(s) inoperable
for pre-1972 model-year vehicles, as an equivalent method to ensure
that scrapped vehicle engines are not reused in vehicles employed
by the public to satisfy normal transportation needs, and still
provide the opportunity for classic car enthusiasts to utilize
cylinder blocks from pre-1972 model year vehicles for collectable
car restoration purposes. <BR>

<P>
The September 1995 amendment did not achieve its
intended effect with regard to cylinder block availability. SCAQMD
Licensed Scrappers have experienced difficulties in terms of the
significant amount of time necessary to dismantle the cylinder
heads from engines, as well as unintentionally damaging the cylinder
blocks in the process of destroying the pistons. Thus, cylinder
block destruction is primarily being utilized by SCAQMD Licensed
Scrappers to comply with Rule 1610. Staff met with representatives
from the antique and collector car enthusiasts, the auto dismantlers,
SCAQMD Licensed Scrappers, and the California Air Resources Board
(ARB) on December 12, 1995 to discuss more efficient methods to
render engines inoperable and still make engines available to
the collector car enthusiasts. A second meeting was held on January
25, 1996 to demonstrate an alternative method which met with consensus
among all parties that the method is feasible.<BR>

<P>
In addition, the SCAQMD Licensed Scrappers Code of
Conduct would be revised to encourage auto dismantlers and SCAQMD
Licensed Scrappers to make a good faith effort to save engine
blocks identified by the collector car enthusiasts for potential
reuse by their membership.<BR>

<P>
The alternative methods add more flexibility to an
existing rule provision. The alternatives have the same end result,
the engine is rendered inoperable, and therefore there is no change
in emissions. No other provision of the rule is affected. Hence,
the proposed amendment to Rule 1610 provides no possibility for
an adverse effect on air quality or emissions limitations.<BR>

<P>
<B>Proposal</B>
<P>
The proposed amendment to Rule 1610 allows two alternatives
to the cylinder block destruction requirement. These alternatives
would be applicable to any model-year vehicle. The first alternative
allows the use of sand, placed in any two adjacent cylinders,
to render the engine inoperable, and yet allow for the potential
rebuilding or salvaging of the engine for reuse in a collector
car application. Cost impacts associated with the rebuilding of
these engines would hinder their reuse in vehicles used to satisfy
the normal transportation needs of the public. The second alternative
would allow for the SCAQMD Licensed Scrapper to submit and demonstrate
any other equivalent procedure that would render the engine inoperable,
while requiring the rebuilding of the engine if it is intended
to be reused in another vehicle.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<B>AQMP</B>
<P>
The proposed amendment adds more flexibility to an
existing rule provision, in terms of the method used to render
the engines of scrapped vehicles inoperable. No other provision
of the rule is affected. Therefore, the proposed amendment to
Rule 1610 provides no possibility for an adverse effect on air
quality or emissions limitations, and is consistent with the AQMP.
<BR>

<P>
<B>CEQA, Socioeconomic Analysis &amp; Cost Effectiveness</B>
<P>
AQMD staff has reviewed the proposed project pursuant
to California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Guidelines Section
15002(k) - Three Step Process, to determine which type of CEQA
document to prepare for the proposed action. Since the proposed
amendment adds more flexibility to an existing rule provision,
but does not effect the resultant emissions, the proposed amendment
has no potential to cause a significant adverse effect on air
quality or emissions limitations. Therefore, AQMD staff has determined
that the proposed amendment is exempt from CEQA pursuant to CEQA
Guidelines Section 15061(b)(3) - Review for Exemption, because
CEQA applies only to projects which have a potential to cause
a significant adverse effect on the environment.<BR>

<P>
The Notice of Exemption, prepared pursuant to state
CEQA Guidelines Section 15062 - Notice of Exemption, will be filed
with the county clerks of Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San
Bernardino counties immediately following the adoption of the
proposal.<BR>

<P>
The amendment adds flexibility to the requirement
to render engines inoperable. It is likely that the scrapper will
use the method they find is effective and less costly, thus it
should not have an adverse cost impact. The emission control costs
and cost-effectiveness values will not change or will be more
favorable compared to the analyses performed as part of Rule 1610
adopted on January 8, 1993. Accordingly, the amendment is cost
effective. This Board Letter serves as the staff report.<BR>

<P>
<B>Description of Nature, Purpose, and Beneficiaries of Project:</B>
<P>
<I>The proposed project revises the provision in Rule 1610 which
requires that the engine of the scrapped vehicle be rendered inoperable.
The rule currently requires the destruction of the engine block
for 1973 and later year vehicles. Pre-1973 vehicles only require
the destruction of the pistons and removal of the cylinder head(s).
The amended rule would allow a licensed scrapper to render the
engine of any vehicle in the program inoperable by one of three
methods: 1) destruction of the engine block, 2) placement of sand
in the cylinders and starting the vehicle, and 3) any other manner
approved by the Executive Officer. </I>

Guidelines Section 15002(k) - Three Step Process, the AQMD has
determined that the proposal is exempt from CEQA pursuant to CEQA
Guidelines Section 15061(b)(3) - Review for Exemption, since the
activity is covered by the general rule that CEQA applies only
to projects which have the potential for causing a significant
effect on the environment. </I>

<B>PROPOSED AMENDED RULE 1610. OLD-VEHICLE SCRAPPING
<BR>
</B>
<P>
(a) Purpose
<P>
The purpose of this rule is to reduce motor vehicle
volatile organic compounds (VOC), nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon
monoxide (CO), and particulate matter (PM) exhaust emissions by
issuing mobile source emission reduction credits in exchange for
the scrapping of old, high emitting vehicles. Procurement of old
vehicles could be accomplished by persons voluntarily giving up
their vehicle for scrapping upon receiving an incentive payment.
This rule provides a mechanism through which stationary source
emissions can be brought into compliance with District regulations
through mobile source emission reductions. Mobile source emission
reduction credits generated would be applied towards compliance
with designated rules with future compliance dates within District
Regulation XI, Source Specific Standards; Regulation XV, Trip
Reduction/Indirect Source; Regulation XIII, New Source Review;
Regulation XX, Regional Clean Air Incentives Market (RECLAIM);
or any other District regulations that allow the use of credits.
The value of these credits is based on old vehicles having at
least three years useful remaining life prior to scrapping.<BR>

<P>
(b) Definitions
<P>
For purposes of this rule, the following definitions
shall apply:
<P>
(1) MOBILE SOURCE EMISSION REDUCTION CREDIT (MSERC)
means credit for real, quantified emission reductions, approved
by the Executive Officer or designee, as authorized by this rule.
<P>
(2) NITROGEN OXIDES (NOx) means the sum of nitric
oxides and nitrogen dioxides emitted, collectively expressed as
nitrogen dioxide emissions.
<P>
(3) OLD-VEHICLE means 1981 and earlier model-year
passenger cars and light-duty trucks.
<P>
(4) OLD-VEHICLE SCRAPPING PROGRAM means a program
in which old vehicles are scrapped in exchange for MSERCs. 
<P>
(5) SCAQMD LICENSED SCRAPPER means an entity certified
by the Executive Officer or designee to generate MSERCs by scrapping
vehicles, as authorized by this rule. 
<P>
(6) SCRAPPING means the process by which a motor
vehicle is permanently removed from service.
<P>
(7) VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUND (VOC) means any volatile
compound of carbon, excluding: methane, carbon monoxide, carbon
dioxide, carbonic acid, metallic carbides or carbonates, ammonium
carbonate, and exempt compounds as defined in District Rule 102.
<BR>

<P>
(c) SCAQMD Licensed Scrapper Certification Requirements
<P>
(1) Certification as an SCAQMD licensed scrapper
shall be limited to: VOC, NOx, CO, or PM stationary emission sources
subject to District Regulation XI, Source Specific Standards,
rules with future compliance dates; Regulation XIII, New Source
Review; Regulation XV, Trip Reduction/Indirect Source; or Regulation
XX, RECLAIM. 
<P>
(2) SCAQMD licensed scrappers shall have vehicles
scrapped only by auto dismantlers that are licensed by the California
Department of Motor Vehicles.
<P>
(3) All scrapping plans approved pursuant to paragraph

to a plan approved after the effective date of this amendment
if at least fifty old vehicles have not been scrapped pursuant
to the plan within six months of plan approval. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the minimum shall be 10 for the motion picture
industry and in cases where the Executive Officer or designee
determines that the minimum of 50 should be lowered because hardship
has been demonstrated, e.g., if the amount of MSERCs that a facility
needs is less than the number of MSERCs generated when 50 vehicles
are scrapped.

decision, as appropriate, as to whether or not MSERCs, to be used
as emission reduction credits (ERCs), should be approved or disapproved.
The decision shall be supported by a succinct written analysis;
and
<P>
(2) publish a notice by prominent advertisement in
at least one newspaper of general circulation in the District
stating the preliminary decision of the Executive Officer or designee
and where the public may inspect the information. The notice shall
provide 30 days from the date of publication for the public to
submit written comments on the preliminary decision; and
<P>
(3) at the time notice of the preliminary decision
is published, make available for public inspection at the District
office the information submitted by the applicant, the supporting
analysis for the preliminary decision, and the preliminary decision
to grant or deny MSERCs and the reasons therefore. The confidentiality
of trade secrets shall be maintained in accordance with Section
6254.7 of the Government Code.<BR>

<P>
(o) Appeal of Disapproval of MSERC Issuance
<P>
An applicant may, within 30 days of receipt of notice
of disapproval, request the Hearing Board to hold a hearing on
whether the scrapping application was properly refused.<BR>

<CENTER><B>Code of Conduct for SCAQMD Licensed Scrappers,
to be a Voluntary Part of the<BR>
Scrapping Plan<BR>
<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
Licensed scrappers are requested to adhere to this
code of conduct in the course of implementing Rule 1610. The purpose
of the code of conduct is to ensure that highly desirable vehicles,
from the perspective of car collector clubs, are not scrapped,
provide maximum opportunity for the re-use of scrapped vehicle
components, and to promote the scrapping of older, less fuel efficient
vehicles.<BR>

<P>
In order to implement the code of conduct, the scrapper
will implement the following:<BR>

<P>
1. Present a written disclaimer to persons volunteering
their vehicles for scrapping, indicating that their vehicle may
be worth more than the incentive payment provided to the owner
by the SCAQMD Licensed Scrapper.<BR>

<P>
2. Agree to set aside up to three percent of vehicles
procured for scrapping, to be chosen by a committee of three persons.
Committee membership will consist of representatives from three
car collector clubs. The District and SCAQMD Licensed Scrappers
would jointly select committee members based on previous contacts
with auto enthusiasts or car collector clubs. The SCAQMD Licensed
Scrapper, after considering input from the committee, would determine
how the vehicles would be sold (including selling price) and the
disposition of funds received from the sale of these vehicles.
<BR>

<P>
3. Federal requirements for vehicle fuel economy
have been increasing in stringency over the past seventeen years.
In recognition of this situation, SCAQMD Licensed Scrappers are
encouraged to promote the scrapping of older, less fuel efficient
vehicles, which are defined for the purposes of this code of conduct
as pre-1978 model-year passenger cars and light-duty trucks. To
proceed with this activity, SCAQMD Licensed Scrappers could, for
example, advertise for these vehicles as part of their overall
efforts to implement their vehicle scrapping programs. In addition,
District staff may be contacted to assist in the identification
of specific vehicles with low fuel efficiency. <BR>

<P>
<U>4.</U> <U>Make a good faith
effort to identify and ensure the maximum availability of potentially
valuable vehicle components, including engine blocks, from scrapped
vehicles for re-use by car collectors as permitted by Rule 1610.
To this end, SCAQMD licensed scrappers and auto dismantlers are
encouraged to render engines inoperable by an approved method
which does not permanently destroy those identified components.

Staff Recommendations and Rulemaking Action Plan
on Intercredit Trading--Increasing Flexibility for AQMD's Mobile
and Stationary Source Emissions Credit Programs
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<B>Synopsis: </B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In April 1995, AQMD initiated the Intercredit
Trading Study. The objective of this study is to assess the feasibility
of linking the AQMD's mobile and stationary emissions credit trading
programs to increase compliance flexibility while achieving air
quality goals. In October 1995, AQMD staff released for public
review a draft paper on issues surrounding intercredit trading.
Four workshops were held in November. Based on public comments
received, staff has finalized its policy recommendations and prepared
an action plan for Board consideration. A rulemaking schedule
to implement the staff's recommendations is provided.

<P>
<B>Recommended Action:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Approve the attached report and direct the Executive Officer to
implement the action plan and to initiate rule development for
an Intercredit Trading Program.

<P>
<B>Background</B>
<P>
AQMD has been working on more open and flexible trading programs
to provide additional compliance flexibility. On October 13, 1995,
the &quot;Concept Paper for Increased Compliance Flexibility&quot;
was presented to the Governing Board and released for public review.
This white paper outlined the AQMD staff's preliminary policy
positions on key issues surrounding intercredit trading and was
designed to stimulate further dialogue between the AQMD and the
public on these key issues. <BR>

<P>
To seek public input, AQMD staff conducted an extensive public
outreach effort by inviting over 10,000 companies and other interested
parties to participate in four public workshops held during November.
To provide interested parties additional opportunity to comment
on this study, the public comment period was extended from December
1, 1995 to January 12, 1996. Meanwhile, AQMD staff also conducted
additional air quality, health, and socioeconomic analyses to
identify key policy implications.
<P>
A final report with staff recommendations and an action plan for
rulemaking has been prepared. The report was presented to the
Board at its February meeting and the item was continued to March
to allow further public input.<BR>

<P>
<B>Proposal</B>
<P>
Staff proposes the recommendations and the action plan in the
attached &quot;Intercredit Trading Study.&quot; In addition, staff
proposes to implement the action plan and initiate rule development.
It is critical to work out details on key design issues and administrative
procedures to ensure credits are real, quantifiable, and surplus.
<P>
<B>Summary of Key Policy Issues and Recommendations</B>
<UL>
<LI><B>Trading Interaction</B>: A universal market can be created
with minimal restrictions to allow emission credits to flow between
various regulatory programs.
<LI><B>Universe of Sources</B>: The existing trading universe
can be expanded to allow more sources to generate and use emission
credits.
<LI><B>Trading Instrument</B>: A universal trading instrument
can be developed to simplify credit transactions while maintaining
the integrity of existing credit programs.
<LI><B>Discount and Offset Factors</B>: A discount factor (technical
uncertainty adjustment) should be applied when appropriate to
ensure real and quantifiable emission credits. An offset factor
(i.e., environmental benefit factor) and the need for such a factor
should be evaluated as part of the 1997 AQMP.
<LI><B>Interseasonal Trading</B>: There is a potential air quality
benefit in shifting VOC emissions from summer to winter months.
In addition, increasing winter VOC emissions would not cause any
ozone exceedances.
<LI><B>Banking</B>: Allowing banking can incentivize clean technologies
and early reductions, contributing to the overall attainment strategy.
However, such a program requires proper program design with backstop
measures to ensure reasonable further progress and attainment
demonstration.
<LI><B>Interpollutant Trading</B>: Current PM<SUB>10</SUB> interpollutant
trading provisions pursuant to NSR should be retained until information
becomes available to support expansion.

<B>Synopsis: </B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
AQMD is seeking EPA approval for the inclusion
of the 1994 AQMP and SIP submittal into the State Implementation
Plan. Prior to approval, AQMD must submit a revised adoption schedule
for the 1994 SIP control measures contained in the 1996 Rule Forecast
Report (March 1996 version). The 1994 AQMP control measures in
the 1996 Rule Forecast Report and provided in this package shall
serve as the Amended Control Measure Adoption Schedule.

<HR>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
<P>
AQMD is seeking EPA approval for inclusion of the 1994 AQMP and
SIP submittal into the State Implementation Plan. EPA has expressed
concern that the 1994 AQMP control measures scheduled for adoption
in 1994 and 1995 have not yet been brought to the Board for action.
EPA indicated a willingness to accept the attached adoption schedule
as the basis for final approval of the 1994 AQMP into the SIP.
To amend the SIP, the proposed rule schedule was required to be
publicly noticed at least 30 days before approval of the amendment.
This requirement has been satisfied.<BR>

<P>
<B>Proposal</B>
<P>
Staff has deleted the proposed rules not included in the 1994
AQMP, and hence, not part of the SIP approval process by EPA.
This schedule will be forwarded to EPA for its final approval
of the SIP submittal.

Rule 1623 - Credits for Clean Lawn and Garden Equipment
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B>Synopsis:</B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Proposed Rule 1623 will provide a mechanism for generating MSERCs
for either voluntarily replacing old high-polluting lawn and garden
equipment with new low- or zero-emission equipment, or for selling
new low- or zero-emission equipment without replacement. The proposed
rule will meet the 1994 AQMP commitment for Control Measures MOF-03
and MOF-04, as well as provide incentives to accelerate the retirement
of old high-polluting equipment and increase the use of new low-
or zero-emission equipment.

<P>
<B>Background</B> 
<P>
Proposed Rule 1623 is the second off-road MSERC program to be
considered for adoption. On September 8, 1995, the Board adopted
Rule 1620 - Credits for Clean Off-Road Equipment which provides
a mechanism for off-road equipment operators to generate MSERCs
for the retrofitting, purchase, or repowering of certain types
of off-road equipment to meet low- or zero-emission emission levels.
Proposed Rule 1623 continues the AQMD's efforts to develop programs
to generate credits for off-road equipment for use in complying
with other AQMD regulations.
<P>
<B>Proposal</B> 
<P>
The proposed rule provides a mechanism for issuing NOx, VOC, CO,
and PM MSERCs to anyone who voluntarily implements any one of
three strategies:
<OL>
<LI>before January 1, 1999, permanently scrap and replace existing
(pre-1995) lawn and garden equipment with new equipment which
meets the 1995 California Emission Standards for Utility and Lawn
and Garden Engines;
<P>
<LI>permanently scrap and replace existing lawn and garden equipment
with new low- or zero-emission equipment (i.e., equipment which
meets the 1999 California Emission Standards for Utility and Lawn
and Garden Engines, electric-powered equipment); or
<P>
<LI>prior to January 1, 1999, sell directly to an end user new
low- or zero-emission lawn and garden equipment, or after January
1, 1999, sell directly to an end user new zero-emission equipment.
</OL>
<P>
Proposed Rule 1623 establishes requirements for submission of
applications, issuance of credits, MSERC calculation, use of credits,
recordkeeping and enforcement. MSERCs issued under Proposed Rule
1623 may be used as RECLAIM Trading Credits, New Source Review
(NSR) offsets, as an alternative method of compliance with AQMD
Regulation XI rules with future compliance dates, and as a method
of compliance with Rule 2202.
<P>
<B>Relationship to Intercredit Trading Program</B> 
<P>
Two issues relating to the issuance of MSERCs under Proposed Rule
1623 are addressed by AQMD's proposed Intercredit Trading Program.
The two issues are: MSERCs may be replaced with a universal trading
credit; and the lifetime of credits issued under the proposed
rule may be extended beyond two years. Subdivision (m) was added
to Proposed Rule 1623 to ensure future consistency with any forthcoming
Intercredit Program rules.
<P>
<B>AQMP &amp; Legal Mandates</B> 
<P>
The proposed rule meets the 1994 AQMP commitment in Control Measures
MOF-03 and MOF-04 to adopt voluntary strategies to generate MSERCs
from off-road sources. The proposed rule is intended to provide
an alternative means of compliance with AQMD regulations, as well
as accelerate the retirement of old high-polluting lawn and garden
equipment and increased use of new low- or zero-emission equipment.
<P>
<B>CEQA &amp; Socioeconomic Analysis</B> 
<P>
Pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and
the AQMD's Certified Regulatory Program (Rule 110), the AQMD has
prepared a Draft Environmental Assessment (EA) for the proposed
rule. The Draft EA was released on March 8, 1996, for a 30-day
review and comment period. The Draft EA determined that the proposed
rule generated no adverse environmental impacts. Responses to
all comments received on the Draft EA will be included in the
Final EA.
<P>
<B>Resource Impacts</B> 
<P>
Sufficient resources have been budgeted in the AQMD Three-Year
Budget Forecast.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
An MOU to implement the interagency consultation requirements
of Rule 1902 has been developed with SCAG and other transportation
agencies. In addition, in 1995, the federal Transportation Conformity
Rule was also amended by the federal government. The proposed
amendment will incorporate the MOU and the recently adopted changes
to the federal Transportation Conformity Rule.

Conformity.

<P>
James M. Lents, Ph.D.<BR>
Executive Officer
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>BW:CLW:LT:CD:GQT</FONT>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<B>Background</B> 
<P>
In September, 1994, the Governing Board adopted Rule 1902 - Transportation
Conformity which codifies the federal transportation requirements
in the South Coast Air Quality Management District.
<P>
At the time of adoption, AQMD staff was participating in a regionwide
endeavor to develop an MOU which established the process for interagency
consultation as specified in the federal transportation conformity
rule.
<P>
Participating agencies included: AQMD, SCAG, ARB, EPA, Caltrans,
Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Orange
County Transportation Authority, San Bernardino Associated Governments,
Riverside County Transportation Commission, Federal Highway Administration,
and the Federal Transit Administration. The adopting resolution
for Rule 1902 stipulated that Subdivision (f) of the rule would
be replaced with the MOU once all participating agencies had signed
it. The signatures have now been obtained and the AQMD is seeking
approval to amend Rule 1902 and subsequently the State Implementation
Plan (SIP).
<P>
In addition, on August 7, 1995, EPA published a set of amendments
in the Federal Register on the federal Transportation Conformity
rule. These amendments basically aligned the timing of the lapse
of conformity determination as a result of state air quality plan
failures with the timing of federal highway sanctions. On November
14, 1995, EPA published a second set of amendments to the rules
on transportation conformity. The second set of amendments allowed
any transportation control measure from an approved SIP to proceed
even though the conformity status of the transportation plan or
program has lapsed. Rule 1902 must now be amended to reflect these
changes. This letter will serve as the staff report.
<P>
<B>Transportation Conformity </B>
<P>
The CAA sets out specific requirements to ensure that no federal
actions interfere with a regional air quality attainment demonstration.
Section 176 of the CAA identifies limitations of federal assistance
and defines conformity as conforming to the intent of the applicable
SIP. In order to conform to a SIP's purpose, the action must not:
cause or contribute to new violations of any pollutant standard;
increase the frequency or severity of any existing violations;
interfere with timely attainment or maintenance of any pollutant
standard; delay emission reduction milestones; or, contradict
SIP requirements.
<P>
<B>Memorandum of Understanding</B> 
<P>
An MOU to implement the interagency consultation requirements
of Rule 1902 has been developed with SCAG and other transportation
agencies (Attachment I). The MOU addresses policies and procedures
on interagency consultation, public involvement, and conflict
resolution. The MOU outlines the roles and responsibilities of
the various public agencies in the development process of the
regional transportation projects, and conformity analyses.
<P>
At its October 1995 Governing Board Meeting, the AQMD Board approved
the preliminary Transportation Conformity MOU and directed the
Executive Officer to schedule a public hearing to revise Rule
1902 once all of the necessary signatures were received. SCAG
was the agency responsible for obtaining signatures from participating
agencies in the region. The Air Resources Board was given the
task of obtaining the remaining signatures from EPA, Federal Highway
Administration, and Federal Transit Administration. Signatures
have been obtained from all of the participating agencies and
upon approval from the Board, the MOU will replace Subdivision
(f) of Rule 1902.
<P>
<B>Amendments to Federal Conformity Rule</B> 
<P>
On August 7, 1995, EPA published the first set of amendments in
the Federal Register as a final rule. The amendment aligned the
timing of certain consequences of state air quality planning failures
under EPA's transportation conformity rule with the imposition
of Clean Air Act highway sanctions. If an implementation plan
for ozone, carbon monoxide, particulate matter or NO2 is disapproved,
the existing conformity determination will remain in effect until
highway sanctions for the disapproval are put into effect under
CAA sanctions.
<P>
On November 14, 1995, EPA published the second set of amendments
in the Federal Register. Under the revised rule, TCMs included
in approved SIPs and previous conforming transportation plans
would be allowed continued implementation even if the status of
the transportation plan or TIP lapsed. EPA's logic is that the
TCMs are designed to improve air quality and disallowing them
because of a conformity lapse would be counter-productive to the
intent of the federal conformity regulations.
<P>
This amendment would extend the grace period to determine conformity
to newly submitted SIPs to 18 months. The proposed rule would
also bring the conformity lapse period in line with the date of
CAA highway sanctions for failure to submit or submission of an
inadequate SIP. Under the CAA, highway sanctions would be put
in place 24 months after the determination of an inadequate SIP
or failure to submit a SIP. The final component of the second
set of amendments requires that ozone nonattainment or maintenance
areas be consistent with the NOx motor vehicle emissions budgets
in control strategy SIPs and maintenance plans, regardless of
any previous conformity NOx waiver. A transportation conformity
SIP revision consistent with these amendments must be submitted
to EPA by 12 months from November 14, 1995.
<P>
<B>California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and Socioeconomic
Impacts</B> 
<P>
Pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), AQMD
staff has reviewed the proposed amendments to Rule 1902 - Transportation
Conformity and has determined that they are exempt from the requirements
of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and therefore,
do not require an environmental or socioeconomic impacts assessment.
<P>
A Notice of Exemption has been prepared for the proposed amendments
and will be filed with the county clerks immediately following
the adoption of the amendments.
<P>
<B>Recommendation</B> 
<P>
Staff has prepared a Proposed Amended Rule 1902 which includes

<P>
<B>Background</B> 
<P>
Assembly Bill 2766 provides that 30 percent of an annual $4 vehicle
registration fee subvened to the AQMD be placed into an account
to be allocated pursuant to a work program developed and adopted
by the MSRC and approved by the AQMD Governing Board. It was estimated
that approximately $12.5 million, including projected interest
to be earned, would be available in the Discretionary Fund in
FYs 1995-96 and 1996-97, respectively. To reduce administrative
burdens and achieve a greater impact in emissions reduction benefits,
the MSRC developed a two-year, $25 million program. On December
7, 1995, the AQMD Governing Board approved this two-year, $25
million program. However, the MSRC has received an unexpected
amount of turn-back funds from contractors who were unable to
perform projects or who experienced lower project costs. The turn-back
funds, coupled with higher interest income than projected, will
leave excess monies in the amount of approximately $4 million
in the AB 2766 Discretionary Fund. In addition to the $4 million,
the MSRC has opted to add $2 million from monies previously set
aside in the FY 1995-97 Work Program to fund focused areas. The
combined total available is approximately $6 million.
<P>
<B>Proposals</B> 
<P>
To utilize these funds and achieve the maximum emissions reduction
benefits, the MSRC's Lessons Learned Subcommittee developed a
supplement to the two-year, $25 million FY 1995-97 AB 2766 Discretionary
Fund Work Program. This $6 million supplemental would consist
of the following five elements:
<OL>
<LI>Three transportation control measure RFPs to share $725,000
(with a minimum funding target of at least $125,000 for each)
in the following areas:
<UL>
  <LI> Land-Use Education and Training
<BR>
  <LI> Market Incentives
<BR>
  <LI> Bicycle Transportation
</UL>
<P>
<LI>A Research and Development RFP with a $900,000 target;
<P>
<LI>An &quot;Alternative Fuels: Heavy-Duty Vehicles&quot; RFP with
a $1,800,000 target;
<P>
<LI>An $850,000 augmentation to the ZEV &quot;Quick Charge&quot;
Program, specifically amending the monies available for the Corridor
Communities Program; and
<P>
<LI>An Advanced Battery Demonstration Program with a $1,800,000
target.
</OL>
The individual target funding allocations may be reassigned by
the MSRC based on the Committee's review of proposals received
in each respective category. A description of each element is
as follows:
<UL>
<LI>The Land-Use Education and Training RFP <I>(Attachment 1)</I>
provides funding for projects that will inform and educate local
jurisdictions and members of the development and financial communities
about land-use techniques that can reduce motor vehicle trips
and facilitate pedestrian, bicycle and public transit trips. This
RFP is intended to encourage cities and counties within the AQMD's
jurisdiction to implement land-use strategies resulting in reduced
air pollution.<BR>

<LI>Market Incentives RFP <I>(Attachment 2)</I> provides funding
for demonstration projects in the area of market incentives, a
major strategy in the 1994 AQMP that will serve as a substitute
for traditional indirect source measures. <BR>

<LI>Bicycle Transportation RFP <I>(Attachment 3)</I> provides
funding for demonstration projects which measurably increase bicycle
commuting and/or intermodal bicycle commuting within a community
or large geographic area. <BR>

<LI>Research and Development RFP <I>(Attachment 4)</I> provides
funding for new innovative research projects in the following
areas: 1) development of advanced emission reduction technologies
for conventional and alternatively fueled on-road motor vehicle
engines; 2) development and evaluation of advanced catalysts for
conventional and/or alternative fuel vehicles; and 3) advanced
remote sensing technology demonstration and evaluation.<BR>

<LI>Alternative Fuels: Heavy-Duty Vehicles RFP <I>(Attachment
5)</I> provides funding for the demonstration of ARB-certified
or &quot;off-the-shelf&quot; alternative fuel heavy-duty engines,
excluding transit and school buses, and specifically targeting
refuse trucks, interstate trucking and heavy-duty high mileage
vehicles.<BR>

<LI>An augmentation of $850,000 to the EV Corridor Communities
Program, one of three components for the &quot;Quick Charge&quot;
Program. This includes a minimum allocation to each of the four
counties of $150,000. (An EV Corridor Communities Program RFP
was approved by the Board on March 8, 1996.)<BR>

<LI>The Advanced Battery Demonstration Program will not be submitted
to the Board for approval until financial partnerships can be
explored with the AQMD's Technology Advancement office and other
agencies to achieve the maximum benefit of this program. Until
the finalized Program is brought forward, the money would be held
in reserve.
</UL>

<P>
A notice announcing the release of these RFPs was recently mailed
to over 1,800 interested parties, and assuming approval of the
RFPs on April 12, ads will appear in several newspapers throughout
the Basin, including major ethnic community newspapers. To assist
potential bidders in submitting qualified proposals, a Bidders'
Conference will be held on April 23, 1996, in the AQMD's Auditorium,
and to provide further assistance, a series of technical workshops
will also be held on May 1, and two more on April 9 and May 17
specifically for the ZEV &quot;Quick Charge&quot; Pro-gram. The
submittal deadline for these five supplemental RFPs is Tuesday,
May 21, 1996, by 5 p.m.
<P>
<B>Resource Impacts</B> 
<P>
The AQMD acts as fiscal administrator to the AB 2766 Program,
and money received for the AB 2766 Discretionary Fund Program
is recorded in a special revenue fund (Fund #23). Since the monies
for these RFPs will be drawn from this special fund, there would
be no fiscal impact on the AQMD's operational budget.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Issue a Request for Proposals to Hire Outside Litigation Counsel
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B>Synopsis:</B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
From time to time the AQMD requires the assistance of outside
litigation counsel having expertise and experience in areas including,
but not limited to, CEQA law, air quality laws, administrative
law, representation of government agencies, constitutional issues,
and complex environmental litigation. The purpose of this RFP
is to solicit qualified law firms or sole practitioners to establish
a pre-qualified list that District Counsel may use to represent
the AQMD in possible future litigation where outside counsel is
required. The maximum total dollar amount that may be contracted
out is $120,000 per year.

<P>

<HR>
<P>
<B>Background</B> 
<P>
Due to the need for rapid response when a lawsuit is served, it
is not possible to go through the RFP process as new cases arise.
Accordingly, the attached RFP solicits proposals from attorneys
qualified to and interested in representing the AQMD in cases
where outside counsel assistance in these specialized areas is
required.
<P>
The intent of this RFP is to qualify one or more law firms or
sole practitioners who may subsequently be engaged by District
Counsel to represent the AQMD in future cases, without need of
going through lengthy consultant selection processes at the time
that assistance is needed.
<P>
Work may be allocated to one or more selected contractors based
on their area of expertise, availability at the relevant time,
and the needs of the AQMD as determined by District Counsel. Specific
assignments of work will be made by District Counsel as the need
arises. In each case, it will be ascertained whether the work
can be performed entirely in-house, and in all cases the work
will be performed under the direction of and with the assistance
of District Counsel.
<P>
The specific amounts of funding available will depend on the District's
1996-1997 budget, but in any case it is expected that the total
amount of funds available will not exceed $120,000. Due to the
nature of this work, selection as a qualified contractor as a
result of this RFP does not necessarily mean any work will be
assigned to any selected consultant. The amount of funding allocated
to each selected litigation counsel will depend upon the nature
of future litigation, the consultant's qualifications, and AQMD
needs.
<P>
<B>Proposal</B> 
<P>
Issue the attached RFP to solicit and pre-qualify law firms and sole
practitioners who will be able to serve as litigation counsel
in future cases representing the AQMD when the need for outside
counsel arises, at a cost not to exceed $120,000.

Amend Contract with Sierra Cybernetics to Increase Funding to Develop
Systems for Electronic Permit Application Filing
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Synopsis: </B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
To expeditiously implement the Board's Regulatory Reform Initiative to
enable electronic filing of permit applications over the Internet, it
is necessary to design and develop a computer system, which can be 
done most cost effectively by amending an existing contract with 
Sierra Cybernetics to provide additional funding in the amount of $49,000.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Committee: </B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Stationary Source, March 22, 1996, Recommended for Approval.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B>Recommended Action:</B>
<OL>
<LI>Amend the contract with Sierra Cybernetics for development
of a pilot electronic permit application filing system at a cost
of $49,000 for a total amount not to exceed $124,000.
<LI>Redesignate $49,000 identified as &quot;VOC RECLAIM Implementation&quot;
in Information Management's FY 1995-96 Professional and Special
Services Account for electronic permit application filing system.
</OL>

<P>

<P>
<HR>
<P>
<B>Background</B> 
<P>
At the January 12, 1996, Board meeting, Chairman Mikels outlined
several regulatory reform initiatives that will continue to improve
AQMD's efficiency and responsiveness to business. One of the initiatives
is the creation of an on-line system for filing permit applications
electronically over the Internet. The goal is to make application
filing easier and more interactive for the applicants. The system
itself should guide applicants through an on-line form to obtain
the necessary information and calculate the applicable fees. After
entering all information and printing a form on a local printer
that lists the fees due, the applicant mails that form in with
the processing fee payment. The system should notify the applicant
via E-mail when payment is received and the application is complete.
In addition, applicants should be able to access information regarding
the status and progress of their electronic application through
the processing system at any time.
<P>
A secure link on the Internet furnishes the best, least intrusive
method for electronic permit application filing. The AQMD's World
Wide Web site on the Internet, implemented in July 1995, provides
an appropriate and available vehicle for this purpose. Regulated
facilities simply need to have PC access to the Internet through
a commercial service and a printer.
<P>
Staff recommends an initial pilot program focusing on facilities
with total emissions less than four tons per year and are not
under the RECLAIM program. Once proven, the pilot system can be
expanded to more equipment types and facilities in the future.
For the pilot program, electronic application forms will be available
for the following equipment types:
<UL>
<LI>Fuel Storage and Dispensing Facilities
<LI>Emergency Standby Engines
<LI>Boilers
<LI>Negative Air Machines
</UL>

<P>
Implementation of this service via the AQMD's Web Page requires
the development of software for electronic data entry and capture,
status queries, and automatic E-mail on the AQMD's World Wide
Web Server.
<P>
<B>Sole Source Justification</B> 
<P>
To implement the pilot system by Fall of 1996, staff recommends
obtaining the necessary services through an existing contract
that was executed following an open bid process. Staff recommends
amending AQMD's contract with Sierra Cybernetics for &quot;Program
Development to Simplify and Streamline Permitting Requirements.&quot;
The Board approved the award of a bid to Sierra Cybernetics on
October 13, 1995, to enhance and expand the AQMD's current equipment
certification/registration program (Item II of the Business Clean
Air Partnership). Under this contract, Sierra Cybernetics is required
to design a system to electronically receive and process technical
information needed to evaluate equipment for certification consistent
with AQMD's central database requirements. Sierra Cybernetics
has gained significant experience with the AQMD's permit processing
systems through their work on the certification/registration program.
The required software development is an expansion of the scope
of the existing contract because both systems will provide electronic
permit application filing, and the equipment types to be included
in the pilot system are similar to those covered by the certification/registration
program. The following is a list of the features common to both
of the development efforts:
<UL>
<LI>Client Interface;
<LI>Application Filing;
<LI>Status Checking;
<LI>Application Tracking;
<LI>Data Validation; and
<LI>Finance Interface for Fees.
</UL>

<P>
Having a single vendor build these components will prevent problems
of uncoordinated interfaces, and reduce the overall development
costs. Therefore, Sierra Cybernetics is the best company to implement
this electronic permit application filing system as requested
by the Governing Board. Staff recommends amending the existing
contract to add software development tasks for electronic permit
application filing computer system on the Internet. This sole
source justification is being made in accordance with provision
number four of the District's Consultant Selection Policy and
Procedure, &quot;Other circumstances exist which require such
a waiver in the best interest of the District.&quot;
<P>
The development of the system will be split in two phases. In
Phase I the contractor will implement the complete system with
support for the four equipment types listed above, and provide
a Software Requirements Specification and Preliminary Software
Design Document. The cost for Phase I will not exceed $49,000.
In Phase II the contractor will implement support for six additional
types of equipment. The cost for Phase II will be included in
the FY 1996-97 Budget, and the expansion will only be conducted
upon successful completion of Phase I beta testing.
<P>
<B>Resource Impacts</B> 
<P>
Funding for this project is available in the FY 1995-96 Budget.

to assist District Counsel in defending litigation where special
expertise is required. Currently there are four cases in which
the firm of Shute, Mihaly &amp; Weinberger serves as lead counsel.
District Counsel staff attorneys continue to act as co-counsel
on these cases in order to minimize litigation expenses.
<P>
The existing cases being handled by the law firm of Shute, Mihaly
&amp; Weinberger include the two RECLAIM lawsuits: <I>Citizens
for a Better Environment v. California Air Resources Board, South
Coast Air Quality Management District, real Party in Interest,
</I>Sacramento Superior Court No. 378401, and <I>Alliance of Small
Emitters/Metal Industry, et al. v. South Coast Air Quality Management
District, </I>Los Angeles Superior Court Case No. BC094283. These
cases involve very large administrative records of approximately
57,000 pages (184 volumes) and 33,000 pages (112 volumes), respectively,
and complex legal issues of first impression.
<P>
In addition, this firm currently is representing the District
in two other active cases. In one case, defendants in a Superfund
cost recovery action brought by the federal and state governments
for cleanup of San Pedro Harbor filed counterclaims against SCAQMD
<I>(USA v. Montrose Chemical, </I>U.S. District Court Case No.
CV 90-3122-AAh (Jrx)). In the other case, we obtained a summary
judgment in favor of the District, and the matter is now on appeal.
In this case the plaintiff paint companies alleged numerous causes
of action against the AQMD and other air districts <I>(Dunn-Edwards,
et al. v. South Coast AQMD, et al., </I>Los Angeles Superior Court
Case No. C753978).
<P>
In all these cases, the selected outside counsel have special
expertise and experience which, in conjunction with the co-counsel
assistance of AQMD attorneys, provide the most effective defense
for the District. We have from the firm an estimate of approximately
$20,000 for likely expenses for the remainder of the fiscal year.
<P>
<B>Resource Impacts</B> 
<P>
The District has previously entered into a Retainer Agreement
with Shute, Mihaly &amp; Weinberger. Although the Agreement does
not specify an amount, staff must obtain your Board's approval
for expenditures under the Agreement. Staff recommends approval
for expenditure of up to an additional $20,000 for litigation
expenses under this agreement for the remainder of FY 1995-1996.
Sufficient funds are available in the District's Fiscal Year 1995-96
Budget, Professional and Special Services account. If significant
new litigation is filed against the District, it may be necessary
to seek additional authorization in the new fiscal year.

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B>Synopsis:</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 In response to an Administrative Committee request for
advice concerning possible effects of a Los Angeles County bankruptcy
on District finances, the AQMD contracted with Stradling, Yocca,
Carlson &amp; Rauth to provide the requested opinion.  During
performance of that work, an urgent need arose for legal assistance
in connection with the potential sale of the El Monte facility
and the firm's real estate department has been handling that work.
 Expenses to date are estimated at approximately $45,000 for these
two tasks; it is estimated that an additional $15,000 will be
needed in this Fiscal Year, bringing the total to $60,000.

<P>
<B>Background</B>
<P>
The AQMD has an existing contract in the amount of $45,000 with
the law firm of Stradling, Yocca, Carlson &amp; Rauth to provide
specialized legal services in two matters.  The first task was
preparation and presentation at the Administrative Committee of
an opinion regarding investment options and the likely effects
of any possible Los Angeles County bankruptcy on District funds.
 That opinion has been presented to the Administrative Committee
and is being provided to your Board in a separate agenda item
for this meeting, Analysis of AQMD Treasury Management Options.
 Work on this task is essentially complete although additional
questions may arise, depending on the option your Board selects
for the AQMD's treasury management.  $21,656.26 has been expended
for this work.
<P>
The second task is ongoing, consisting of legal advice on issues
relating to the possible sale or lease of the AQMD's El Monte
facility.  The firm has provided legal advice in the evaluation
of several different contingent offers to purchase the building,
has represented AQMD in negotiations with the selected offeror,
and has taken the lead in review of necessary legal documents.
 The firm has provided us with an estimate of the additional costs
to be incurred during the escrow period and during closing, if
the sale is completed.  As of the date of preparation of this
letter, approximately $11,000 had been spent on this task.  The
firm estimates it will require an additional $20,000 to complete
the work on this task, barring unforeseen circumstances.  This
would bring the total amount of the contract to approximately
$52,000.  To cover uncertainty of the estimate, the Board is requested
to authorize an amendment increasing the total amount payable
to $60,000, which is a $15,000 increase over the existing contract.
<P>
<B>Resource Impacts</B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Execute a Contract to Cost-share the Development of an Interstate
Clean Transportation Corridor
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B>Synopsis:</B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Use of alternative fuels in medium- and heavy-duty trucks in the
Basin could significantly reduce their emissions. However, many
of these trucks come into California from other states. Until
the alternative fuel infrastructure can support interstate trucks,
a large percentage of fleets cannot use alternative fuels. The
proposed contract with Gladstein &amp; Associates will design
an alternative fuel infrastructure to link Arizona, California,
Nevada, and Utah. Total estimated project costs are $413,000.
AQMD funding shall not exceed $50,000.

<B>Background</B> 
<P>
Ozone attainment in the South Coast Air Quality Management District
will require substantial reductions of NOx emissions from all
significant source categories, including heavy-duty trucks. The
ARB estimates that heavy-duty trucks represent 4 percent of the
vehicle population in California, but will contribute nearly 50
percent of the NOx and over 80 percent of the on-road particulate
matter (PM) by the year 2010. ARB has estimated that by the year
2010, the heavy-duty truck percent contributions in terms of total
number of in-use vehicles (TOT), total vehicle-miles-traveled
(VMT) and total emissions in the Basin are as follows:

</PRE>


<P>
The 1994 Air Quality Management Plan emphasizes the use of alternative
fuels throughout the transportation sector as an air quality attainment
strategy. Use of alternative fuels in trucks could significantly
reduce their emissions, although it is estimated that about 20
percent of the heavy-duty truck vehicle miles traveled (VMT) is
produced from vehicles registered outside California.
<P>
While there have been many local and state-sponsored alternative
fuel demonstrations, none have attempted to link the efforts of
neighboring states. The California Trucking Association (CTA),
whose members travel throughout the western states, and several
out-of-state consortiums have expressed an interest in pursuing
a number of alternative fuel, interstate trucking demonstrations
between California, Nevada, Utah, and Arizona.
<P>
In developing these joint demonstrations, it is necessary to create
geographic linkages not only between neighboring states, but also
among engine and vehicle manufacturers, as well as potential alternative
fuel truck fleet operators. Without a strategy uniting these interests,
it is unlikely that a critical mass of alternative fuel vehicles
and tangible fuel consumption, which are needed to encourage investments
in infrastructure, will materialize to sustain an interstate alternative
fuels market. It is the intent of staff to use the information
and data resulting from this project as the basis for future solicitations,
including request for proposals, for alternative fuel truck demonstrations.
<P>
<B>Proposal</B> 
<P>
Gladstein &amp; Associates, working in conjunction with the Center
for Resource Management (CRM), Urban Dimensions (UD), and Acurex
Environmental Corporation (AEC), proposes to develop and implement
a program to create the Interstate Clean Fuel Corridor (ICTC)
within the states of Arizona, California, Nevada, and Utah. The
purpose of the ICTC will be to mobilize and concentrate public
and private resources to build the necessary refueling infrastructure
to permit long-haul vehicles to use clean, alternative fuels and
to ensure that the fuel infrastructure is fully utilized by local
and interstate fleets of AFVs.
<P>
The goal of the proposal is to establish an initial blueprint
for a sustainable alternative fuel infrastructure which can service
alternative fuel truck traffic between the region's seven major
non-attainment areas: Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Sacramento, Salt
Lake City, the San Joaquin Valley, San Diego, and Phoenix. Specifically,
Gladstein and Associates shall identify the following:
<P>
Potential locations for alternative fuel dispensers which would
accommodate inter-state traffic and be placed at an average distance
of 180 miles apart;
<P>
Candidate interstate fleet operators who travel to and from the
South Coast Air Basin to locations outside California, including
the identification of their travel routes; and
<P>
Partnerships to support the installation of refueling equipment
and the purchase of alternative fuel vehicles along the corridors.
<P>
This proposed project is included in the Technology Advancement
Plan for the Clean Fuels Program as Project MS-11, &quot;Development
and Demonstration of Low Emission, Alternative Fuel Technologies
for On-Road Applications.&quot; This project targets the implementation
of 500 low-emission medium-duty alternative trucks and 250 low-emission
heavy-duty alternative fuel trucks, and a fueling network to support
these vehicles. Although these vehicles will not all operate exclusively
in the Basin, they will still be able to provide substantial Basin
reductions of NOx and PM. Low-emission medium- and heavy-duty
engines currently have half or less of the emissions of conventional
diesel engines.
<P>
<B>Sole Source Justification</B> 
<P>
Section II, Step 3(C) of the Consultant Selection Policy and Procedure
identifies four provisions under which the Executive Officer may
award a sole-source bid: (1) cost to prepare documents exceeds
cost for consultant, (2) delay would result in the endangerment
of public health, (3) services are only available from sole-source,
(4) other circumstances exist identifying sole-source as in the
best interests of the AQMD. This request for sole-source bid is
made under provision #4.
<P>
It is in the AQMD's best interests to enter into a costshare agreement
with Gladstein &amp; Associates for development and implementation
of the Interstate Clean Transportation Corridor, leveraging $50,000
in AQMD funds into the approximately $400,000 required to develop
this program. Capital investments in refueling equipment and vehicles
necessary to fully implement the program will exceed $4 million.
<P>
Gladstein &amp; Associates, a small business in the Basin, has
assembled a team uniquely qualified to develop and implement the
ICTC. The team includes recognized policy and technology leaders
who have worked at the forefront of creating innovative strategies
to promote alternative fueled and electric vehicles in light-,
medium- and heavy-duty vehicle applications. Cliff Gladstein,
President of Gladstein &amp; Associates, is currently a Program
Specialist for the Department of Energy's Clean Cities Program.
He also has been a consultant for Southern California Gas Company's
natural gas vehicle programs, alternative energy technology programs,
and related policy issues. Mr. Gladstein served on the President's
Federal Fleet Conversion Task Force and wrote the Clean Air Plan
for the City of Los Angeles.
<P>
Technical support will be provided by Acurex Environmental Corporation
(AEC). AEC is internationally recognized as an alternative fuel
technical and policy consultant. The organization has provided
expertise to the ARB, California Energy Commission, and major
air districts in California, and has provided technical support
to a number of alternative fuel vehicle demonstrations.
<P>
AEC encourages the participation of, and uses as subcontractors,
small businesses, and minority-, disabled veteran-, and woman-owned
business enterprises in its programs to the maximum extent possible
to ensure efficient performance and comply with contract requirements
and applicable laws. AEC has a small business liaison person,
whose responsibility is to develop and promote the utilization
of these businesses to participate in contract performance. AEC
is a member of the Industry Council for Small Business Development
in California. The company utilized the Small Business Administration's
Procurement Automated Source System to search for specific requirements.
<P>
<B>Resource Impacts</B> 
<P>
Total cost of the creation of the Interstate Clean Transportation
Corridor development and implementation program is approximately
$400,000, with AQMD funding not to exceed $50,000. The U. S. Department
of Energy has committed $135,000 and the ARB has committed $50,000.
Other funding sources being pursued include the California Energy
Commission, the Nevada Energy Office, and other APCDs.
<P>
Sufficient funds are available in the Fiscal Year 1995-96 Budget
to fund this project.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Car rental companies in the Basin operate thousands
of vehicles. These companies have been reluctant to incorporate
alternative fuel vehicles into their operations because they are
uncertain about vehicle reliability and acceptance. The proposed
contract with Sunline Transit Agency will facilitate the introduction
of natural gas vehicles into The Hertz Corporation fleet at Palm
Springs Airport, and provide comparative data collection among
natural gas, methanol, and gasoline vehicles. Total project cost
is approximately $1,500,000; AQMD cost-share is $38,000.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The AQMP emphasizes the use of fuel cell and battery-powered ZEVs
as an air-quality attainment strategy. McKesson Water Products
(Sparkletts) has proposed to develop and demonstrate a battery-powered
electric water delivery truck. Such water delivery trucks start
and stop over 200 times per day, and have greater emissions than
indicated by their daily use of 70 miles. The cost of the Sparkletts'
demonstration program is $377,000, of which AQMD would cost-share
in an amount not to exceed $175,000.

James M. Lents, Ph.D.<BR>
Executive Officer
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>ARA:CS:dv</FONT>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<B>Background</B> 
<P>
The AQMD operates a number of alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs),
including those powered by compressed natural gas (CNG), propane,
methanol (M85), ethanol (E85), and electricity. Most of these
vehicles are assigned to AQMD inspectors or utilized in the AQMD's
motor pool. Many of these vehicles perform &quot;double-duty&quot;
as part of the AQMD's car pool program.
<P>
Several of the AQMD-owned AFVs are used in the Technology Advancement
Alternative Fuel Vehicle Fleet Lease Demonstration Program. This
program makes these vehicles available to public and private organizations
on a short-term lease, no-cost basis, so that potential purchasers
may familiarize themselves with available alternative technologies.
This program also makes AFVs available to legislators to familiarize
them with clean fuel vehicle technologies. These vehicles are
made available by AQMD staff for demonstration and display at
meetings, conferences, and workshops. To be most effective, the
lease program must include the most advanced, commercially available
AFVs to be test driven by prospective purchasers. Electric bikes
are becoming popular with security organization and large facilities.
The bikes will be loaned to police departments, colleges and manufacturers.
<P>
<B>Proposal</B> 
<P>
Staff recommends Board authorization for up to $100,000 in total
to purchase four new vehicles and two electric-assist bicycles.
These vehicles will replace six existing vehicles in the Technology
Advancement Alternative Fuel Vehicle Fleet Lease Demonstration
Program. The vehicles to be replaced are two 1993 Ford Taurus
FFVs, two 1993 Dodge Intrepid FFVs, and two 1993 Eagle Vision
FFVs, all powered by M85. The vehicles being replaced are no longer
commercially available or have been dramatically redesigned and
will be transferred to the AQMD's motor pool.
<P>
Specifically, it is recommended that the AQMD issue purchase orders
for:
<UL>
<LI><I><U>One M85 Ford Taurus FFV</U></I> - ARB-certified as a transitional
low-emission vehicle (TLEV) and has been redesigned for the 1996
model year. The 1996 model features a revised catalyst, an Electric
Thermactor Air (ETA) system, new steel fuel tank (18 gallon capacity),
a revised fuel composition sensor, and a new in-tank fuel delivery
module. The estimated cost of this vehicle is $20,000.
<P>
<LI>Prior year models have been successfully sold to rental fleets
and private, sales-oriented fleet operators, that is, fleets which
do <U>not </U>operate on a daily fixed route schedule.
<P>
<LI><I><U>One CNG-powered Ford Crown Victoria</U></I> - ARB-certified as
a ultra-low emission vehicle (ULEV) and is the first CNG-powered
sedan offered for sale by a major auto maker. The estimated cost
of this vehicle is $25,000.
<P>
<LI>This model is particularly attractive because of its broad use
as a police and taxi cab fleet vehicle in the South Coast Air
Basin.
<P>
<LI><I><U>One CNG-powered Ford F-Series pickup truck</U></I> - This truck
is Ford's first CNG-powered pickup. This model features the Ford
4.9L I-6 Gaseous Fuel Prep Engine and is offered with either a
bi-fuel or dedicated fuel system. Both versions will be certified
at the low emission vehicle standard. Staff recommends the purchase
of the dedicated fuel system design with an estimated vehicle
cost of $25,000.
<P>
<LI><I><U>One CNG-powered Dodge Ram pickup truck</U></I> - ARB-certified
as a ULEV and is Chrysler's first CNG-powered pickup offering.
This model features the Dodge 5.2 V-8 natural gas engine and a
dedicated fuel system. The estimated cost of this vehicle is $25,000.
<P>
<LI>Pickup trucks are attractive for airport and municipal truck pools,
delivery trucks, couriers, utilities, and vehicles for trades
such as plumbers, electricians, and carpenters.
<P>
<LI><I><U>One AeroVironment AV Patroller</U></I> - This bicycle has been
successfully demonstrated by the Monrovia Police Department. It
has 21 speeds, 0.5 horse power, and has a reasonable weight-to-power
of 112 lbs/hp. The estimated cost of the bicycle is $2,000.
<P>
<LI><I><U>One Electric Bicycle Company EV Warrior Deluxe</U></I> - This bicycle
was developed by Malcom Brinklin and Malcom Currie in conjunction
with CALSTART. This unit has a very high power of 1.2 hp and a
better weight-to-power of 96 lbs/hp. The estimated cost of the
bicycle is $1,500.
<P>
<LI>Electric-assist bicycles are beginning to build a niche market,
particularly with police departments who use them in congested,
downtown areas and in parks to arrive at a scene quickly without
the need for a motor vehicle.
</UL>
<P>
This proposed project is included in the Technology Advancement
Plan for the Clean Fuels Program in two sections, for the CNG
and M85 vehicles as MS-11, &quot;Development and Demonstration
of Low Emission, Alternative Fuel Technologies for On-Road Applications,&quot;
and for the electric-assist bicycles as MS-13, &quot;Development
and Demonstration of Advanced Electric Vehicle Technologies.&quot;
The expected benefits of this project are direct emission reductions
during the demonstration period, evaluation of technical performance,
and increased public awareness. The goal is to evaluate real-world
technical performance, including reliability, durability and safety,
while at the same time identifying barriers to broader commercialization.
Staff will be investigating electric vehicles, such as General
Motors' EV1, during Fiscal Year 1996-97.
<P>
<B>Sole Source Justification</B> 
<P>
Section II, Step 3(C) of the Consultant Selection Policy and Procedures
identifies four provisions under which the Executive Officer may
award a sole-source bid: (1) cost to prepare documents exceeds
cost for consultant, (2) delay would result in the endangerment
of public health, (3) services are only available from sole-source,
(4) other circumstances exist identifying sole-source as in the
best interests of the AQMD. This request for sole-source bid is
made under provision #3.
<P>
The objective of the Technology Advancement Alternative Fuel Vehicle
Fleet Lease Demonstration Program is to make available the most
advanced, commercially available vehicles for test driving by
prospective purchasers. Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation
are the only automakers to currently market certified low-emission,
CNG and M85-powered vehicles. AeroVironment and the Electric Bicycle
Company are local, Southern California-based companies offering
high-powered electric-assist bicycles. There are a number of electric-assist
bicycles on the market, produced both in the U.S. and in other
countries. AeroVironment and Electric Bicycle Company produce
the only products with adequate power and range to meet a variety
of terrain and application requirements necessary for this project.
<P>
<B>Resource Impacts</B> 
<P>
Total estimated cost of these four vehicles and two electric-assist
bicycles, including tax and license, will not exceed $100,000.
Sufficient funds are available in FY 1995-96 Budget to fund this
project.

<HR>

<P>
<B>Background</B> 
<P>
In 1994, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) instituted
a Peer Match Program to assist states, territories and agencies
in developing and implementing their small business assistance
programs (SBAPs). EPA recognized that the benefits achieved by
Peer Match (mentoring) exceed the costs. States and agencies which
have participated in Peer Match have saved money by adopting,
rather than recreating elements of successful programs.
<P>
EPA selected the AQMD as a Peer Match recipient, based on its
outstanding small business assistance program. Section 507 of
the Federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, requires each state
to have a SBAP. AQMD's program was established in 1989 and has
already served as a model for several states, including Texas,
Colorado, Pennsylvania, Oregon, and Louisiana. US EPA's guidelines
for fund use include: development of training materials, payment
of travel expenses for participants, and long distance telephone
expenses.
<P>
States that have interest in participating in this peer match
program must submit a written request to the US EPA's Small Business
Ombudsman, who determines eligibility. EPA's Small Business Ombudsman
arranges the match between the requester and states which have
grants to provide Peer Match. All state and local programs with
small business assistance responsibility under the Federal Clean
Air Act, including AQMD, are potentially eligible participants.
<P>
<B>AQMD Responsibility</B> 
<P>
The Public Advisor's Office will provide training materials and
staff time and resources to conduct the Peer Match training. AQMD
will also be available to assist Peer Match participants on an
on-going basis and will provide on-site assistance if required.
Each Peer Match participant will be asked to complete an evaluation
of the assistance they receive. A lessons learned summary will
be prepared. AQMD will provide a written report on the program
results to US EPA by December, 1996 and will also report back
to the Governing Board.
<P>
<B>Benefits</B> 
<P>
Before there was a Peer Match Program, the AQMD and other agencies
had to assume the full cost of sharing information and resources.
Some states, territories and agencies have been slow to implement
small business assistance because they lack the knowledge and
resources. In other cases, if there was a way for the states to
get together and share detailed information, resources developed
in one state could enhance the program in another state. Peer
Match enhances the opportunity for information and resource sharing
by absorbing part of the cost associated with this process.
<P>
By working together, SBAP representatives have already made significant
progress in obtaining EPA policy interpretations that benefit
small business owners/operators nationwide. For example, SBAPs
obtained an enforcement policy guideline which made the information
obtained from an on-site consultation by a SBAP confidential.
<P>
US EPA, national trade associations, states, territories and agencies
all have expressed their support for strong small business assistance
programs nationwide. The parties anticipate that these programs
will result in better air pollution control strategies, commonly
acceptable clean industry standards, and information dissemination
to equipment and product manufacturers.
<P>
The required 30-day public notification period of a proposed supplement
to the FY 1995-96 budget ends April 10, 1996. Therefore, the Board
may take action April 12, 1996 to recognize and appropriate $25,000
from the US EPA Peer Grant Program.

<B>Background</B> 
<P>
<B>EIR and Document Log (Attachments A and B)</B> - Each month,
the AQMD receives numerous CEQA documents from other public agencies
on projects which could adversely affect air quality. Listings
of all documents received for review are contained in Attachments
A and B. Monthly listings which are shaded note those CEQA documents
for which the AQMD staff has or will prepare and submit comments
to the lead agency. A list of active projects from previous months
for which AQMD staff is continuing to evaluate or prepare comments
is included as Attachment B. A column has been added to the tables
in Attachments A and B of this report in response to Board member
request. The column captioned &quot;Public Concerns&quot; identifies
parties who have contacted the AQMD with concerns or issues about
the proposed project. A notation of 1 in this column indicates
the contact was supportive of the project noted. A notation of
2 indicates the party was opposed or expressed concerns about
the project. A notation of 3 indicates that no one contacted the
AQMD about that project.
<P>
In the past, AQMD staff routinely reviewed many of these documents
and commented upon the air quality analyses and possible impacts
on the air quality of the district. Due to staffing constraints,
the AQMD is no longer able to routinely comment on all CEQA documents
received. Publication of the Board-approved <I>CEQA Air</I> <I>Quality
Handbook</I>, however, has provided local governments and other
public agencies with the necessary information to prepare appropriate
air quality analyses on projects for which they act as lead agency.
As resources permit, staff evaluates and may prepare comments
for projects that may have significant adverse regional air quality
impacts (e.g., special event centers, landfills, etc.) and those
projects for which a lead or responsible agency has specifically
requested AQMD review.
<P>
<B>AQMD Lead Agency Projects (Attachment C)</B> - Pursuant to
CEQA, the AQMD periodically acts as lead agency on stationary
source permit projects. Under CEQA the lead agency is responsible
for determining whether an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) or
a Negative Declaration is necessary for any proposal considered
to be a &quot;project&quot; as defined by CEQA. An EIR is prepared
when the AQMD as lead agency finds substantial evidence that the
proposed project may have a significant adverse effect on the
environment. A Negative Declaration may be prepared if the AQMD
determines that the proposed project will not generate significant
adverse environmental impacts. The Negative Declaration is a written
statement describing the reasons a proposed project will not have
a significant adverse effect on the environment and, therefore,
does not require the preparation of an EIR.
<P>
Attachment C to this report summarizes the active projects for
which the AQMD is lead agency and is currently preparing or has
prepared environmental documentation. As noted in Attachment C,
during February 1996, the AQMD continued working on CEQA documents
for three (3) active projects.
<P>
To date in 1996, the AQMD, as lead agency, prepared or contracted
for the preparation of and certified one (1) CEQA document.

Report on the Air Monitoring Modernization and Streamlining Plan
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B>Synopsis:</B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
To operate a modern, efficiently functioning air monitoring network,
consistent with the projected declining revenue in the years ahead,
staff has developed a modernization and streamlining program.
Over the next decade, this program would reduce the size of the
network from 35 to 22 permanent sites and modernize station equipment
by introducing automation as well as remote diagnosis and calibration
of equipment. This will result in labor savings which will more
than offset the capital equipment costs.

<P>
<B>Background</B> 
<P>
Over the next ten to twelve years, the AQMD faces the challenge
of providing an air quality network that adequately characterizes
our progress toward attainment and maintenance of the ambient
air quality standards within a framework of progressively reduced
levels of funding and staffing. To meet this challenge, staff
has developed a monitoring network downsizing plan and a concurrent
equipment modernization plan that will allow more efficient operation
of the monitoring program. The plan presented is based on the
assumption that attainment of the federal air quality standards
will be achieved (except for ozone) by 2008.
<P>
<B>Proposal</B> 
<P>
<U>Network Streamlining</U> - The current air monitoring network
consists of 35 permanent sites with good geographic coverage of
populated areas of AQMD's jurisdiction. The plan would schedule
decrease of the network size to 22 sites between 1996 and 2008
in a four step process. Following is a listing, by year, of proposed
station closures:

<PRE WIDTH=132>
   --------------------------------------------------------------------
         1996                 1998              2002           2008      
   --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Temecula            Costa Mesa         La Habra       Pasadena    

        Hemet              Riverside       Lake Elsinore      Reseda     

     Diamond Bar             Pomona           Ontario          Norco     

 Norco (retain PM10)       West L.A.           ------          ------                


</PRE>


<P>
In 2008, the network would focus on the Metropolitan L.A.-Orange
County area to monitor attainment of NO<FONT SIZE=1.5>2</FONT> and CO and along the
foothills of the San Gabriel and San Bernardino Mountains to track
progress in areas of highest ozone and PM10. Staff believes that
the 22-site network will be adequate to characterize air quality
in a maintenance setting once we approach or attain the standards.
Temporary sites making measurements over 3-6 month periods would
periodically be used to fill in information gaps caused by site
closures. The constitution of the permanent monitoring network
in 2008 would be as follows:
<PRE WIDTH=132>
Anaheim           Glendora            Los Angeles          Redlands          
Azusa             Hawthorne           Lynwood              Rubidoux          
Banning           Indio               Palm Springs         San Bernardino    
Burbank           Lake Forest         Perris               Santa Clarita     
Crestline         Lancaster           Pico Rivera          Upland            
Fontana           Long Beach                                                    

</PRE>

<P>
<U>Equipment Modernization</U> - Concurrent with the streamlining,
anticipated attrition of staff through 2008 will reduce the assigned
personnel from the current 26 to 16. The plan calls for acquiring
state-of-the-art monitoring equipment and computerized peripheral
equipment that will allow remote diagnosis of instrument problems,
remote activation of calibration sequences, and remote validation
of field-generated data. Additional equipment includes instrumented
temporary sites to fill in the data gaps resulting from the streamlining,
and various diagnostic equipment to maintain the new generation
monitoring equipment.
<P>
<U>Fiscal Impacts</U> - The five-year (1996-2002) fixed asset
cost of the modernization program will be $842,000, and will be
supplemented by EPA maintenance grant funding. The modernization
program will pay for itself from salary savings in approximately
six years, since staff attrition can be allowed to take place
and still provide the level of monitoring necessary. Annual salary
savings from 2008 and beyond are estimated at $700,000. The Fiscal
Year 1996-97 proposed budget includes $147,000 for the first year
of this five-year modernization program which will be funded by
the District's equipment replacement reserve.

<P>
<B>Background</B> 
<P>
On September 8, 1995, the Governing Board adopted <B>Rule 310
- Amnesty for Unpermitted Equipment, </B>implementing Point 10
of the Business Clean Air Partnership. The goal was to &quot;seek
a level playing field for all businesses by establishing a 6-month,
no-penalty amnesty period for unpermitted businesses during which
they could obtain permits.&quot; The amnesty period was from October,
1995 through March, 1996. During this period, facilities that
voluntarily applied for permits for existing equipment were not
subject to late fees or civil or criminal penalties for not having
the required permits. At its October meeting, the Board amended
Rule 310 to allow facilities with reported emissions of 10 tons
per year or more to submit applications under the Amnesty program
for schedule A and B equipment.
<P>
<B>Program Results</B> 
<P>
This program has been a success. By February 29, 1996, over 600
applications for permits had been submitted under the Amnesty
Program. This exceeded staff expectations of 300 applications
when the program was adopted. Based on the first five months of
experience, it is likely that at least 750 applications will have
been submitted during the Amnesty period.
<P>
Staff conducted an aggressive advertising and direct mail campaign
to notify the regulated community of the Amnesty Program. By far
the most successful outreach was the direct mail. A total of 60
tailored notices were mailed to slightly over 100,000 facilities.
The mailing generated close to 2,500 calls resulting in 950 application
packages being mailed out.
<P>
Of the facilities who have submitted applications so far, 58%
were from companies that had never previously obtained a permit
from the AQMD. Approximately 95% of the applications received
were from facilities emitting less than 10 tons. The applications
received represent a wide range of equipment types. The following
list summarizes the type of applications:
<PRE WIDTH=132>
     CFC Recycling Units                         228

Report to the Legislature and the Air Resources Board on the 
AQMD's Regulatory Activities for Calendar Year 1995
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B>Synopsis:</B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District is required by
law to submit a report to the Legislature on its regulatory activities
for the preceding calendar year. The report is to include a summary
of each rule and rule amendment adopted by the District, number
of permits issued or denied, emission offset transactions, three-year
budget forecast, the District's response to any recommendations
included from the triennial performance audit process, District
actions in response to state Board and Legislative recommendations
regarding their review of AQMD's budget, and a biennial update
on the clean fuels program.

<P>
<B>Background</B> 
<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District is subject to
multiple internal and external reviews of its air quality programs.
These include triennial performance audits; an annual review of
the District's three-year budget forecast and proposed operating
budget for the upcoming fiscal year and compliance program audits.
<P>
In 1990, the Legislature directed the District to provide an annual
review of its regulatory activities (SB 1928, Presley), and specified
the type of information required. Many of the required elements
overlap with others contained in separate legislation. For example,
this report is to include the District's three-year budget forecast
which is already a separate requirement under legislation passed
in 1994. The purpose of this report is to fill in the pieces of
missing data to compile a comprehensive regulatory overview.
<P>
Most of the information included in this report is not new, but
simply a compilation of monthly activity reports previously seen
by the Board. Chapter I compiles a list of rules and amendments
adopted by the Governing Board during 1995. The section detailing
the Public Advisor and Business Assistance is a summary of regular
activity reports previously reviewed by the Board.
<P>
The specific requirements of this report include:
<UL>
<LI>a summary of each major rule and rule amendment adopted by
the District Governing Board;
<LI>the number of permits to operate or to construct that are
issued, denied or not renewed;
<LI>data on emission offset transactions and applications during
the previous year;
<LI>a forecast of proposed budget and staff increases for the
following fiscal year;
<LI>an identification of the source of all revenues used to finance
the District's activities;
<LI>any actions taken in response to recommendations from the
state Air Resources Board or Legislature relating to their review
of AQMD's budget, and
<LI>a biennial update on the results of the District's clean fuels
program.
</UL>

<P>
Although not required by law, the attached report also includes
information on the District's Public Advisor and its activities
in the areas of business assistance, economic development and
public outreach. This is meant to supplement the required elements
and provide a more complete and comprehensive summary of AQMD's
annual regulatory activities.
<P>
A draft of this report has been submitted to the Legislature to
comply with the April 1 statutory deadline. Once approved by the
Board, a final copy will be forwarded to the Legislature.

<B>Attendees</B> 
<P>
Chair Mee Lee and Committee members Candace Haggard, Nell Soto
and Jim Silva were present. In addition, Board Chairman Jon Mikels
attended.
<P>
<B>Summary</B> 
<P>
The Committee reviewed the items on their agenda. Comments were
noted on the following items:
<P>
<B>1. Status Report on Rule 201 - Permit to Construct</B> 
<P>
EPA is still discussing their position on the definition of &quot;start
of construction.&quot; The hearing on this item is scheduled for
June. Nell Soto and Jon Mikels were concerned that local governments
be apprised of this issue.
<P>
<B>2. Regulation XIII - New Source Review Update </B>
<P>
The Federal Land Manager notice and visibility analysis requirements
were discussed. Certain industries have requested a higher emissions
threshold (100 or 250 tons) prior to requiring compliance with
this provision of the Clean Air Act. Board Chairman Jon Mikels
noted that the Federal Class I protection areas primarily impact
San Bernardino and Riverside counties. In turn, a special briefing
for the Board members from those areas was requested prior to
the April 12 Board hearing.
<P>
<B>3. Update on Rule 1136 - Wood Products Coatings</B> 
<P>
The status of research on this rule was presented. Industry has
requested a significant relaxation in the rule limits scheduled
for July 1996, which would match the national &quot;Reg. Neg.&quot;
proposed rule. The Committee was concerned about the current level
of compliance with the July 1996 limits, and questioned the short
time left prior to the rule deadline.
<P>
<B>4. General discussion on the VOC alternate rules to VOC RECLAIM,
with particular focus on Rule 1171 - Solvents</B> 
<P>
The material for this item is attached for the Board's information.
The Committee discussed cost-effectiveness, total emission reductions,
and the schedule for these rules. In addition, there will be a
discussion at next month's meeting on the flexibility options
that will be incorporated into each of these rules.
<P>
<B>5. Point 10 of the Business Clean Air Partnership</B> 
<P>
The status of the amnesty program was presented.
<P>
<B>6. Amend Contract with Sierra Cybernetics to Increase Funding
to Develop Systems for Electronic Permit Application Filing</B>

<P>
The Committee reviewed the proposal; commended the staff and recommended
approval of the contract.
<P>
Note: Future Stationary Source Committee meetings will be scheduled
at 10:30 a.m.

<B>Minutes</B> 
<P>
The minutes of the November 9, 1995, and February 22, 1996, monthly
meetings were approved, as submitted, and are provided for your
information as <I>Attachments 1 &amp; 2</I>.
<P>
<B>Supplement to Fiscal Year 1995-97 AB 2766 Discretionary Fund
Work Program</B> 
<P>
Because of an unprecedented amount of turn-back funds in excess
of $2 million, higher interest income than projected, the delay
in the schedule of several high-priced contracts, and using monies
previously set aside in FY 1995-97 to fund focused areas, the
MSRC has identified approximately $6.5 million for a supplement
to the Fiscal Year 1995-97 AB 2766 Discretionary Fund Work Program.
The MSRC's Lessons Learned Subcommittee, on which I have been
participating periodically, has been formulating this supplement
to the Work Program. At its March 28 meeting, the MSRC approved
the supplemental work program consisting of the following five
elements:
<OL>
<LI>Three transportation control measure RFPs to share $725,000
in the areas of land-use education and training, market incentives,
and bicycle transportation, with a minimum target of $125,000
allocated to each RFP. (Although I remain skeptical of the quantifiable
emissions benefits of certain projects in this area, there are
a few worthwhile efforts that can be accomplished, and I believe
the funding target for this element is balanced appropriately.)
<P>
<LI>A research and development RFP with a funding target of $900,000.
<P>
<LI>An alternative-fueled heavy-duty vehicle RFP with a funding
target of $1.8 million, targeting refuse and interstate trucks,
and excluding transit and school buses, with a $250,000 1-1 match
minimum.
<P>
<LI>An augmentation of $850,000 to the Electric Vehicle Corridor
Communities Program, with an increased minimum funding level for
each of the four counties of $150,000. (We approved the EV Corridor
Communities Program RFP at our last meeting on March 8.)
<P>
<LI>An advanced battery demonstration program with a funding target
of $1.8 million. This program will solicit responses through the
release of either an RFP or PON after financial partnerships have
been explored with the Technology Advancement office and other
agencies.
</OL>
<P>
When the EV Corridor Communities Program was developed by the
MSRC, it included a minimum funding target for each of the four
counties at $75,000, with a portion of the monies in a reserve
exclusive of the RFP, so that underserved areas could be allocated
funds where needed. In response to Chairman Mikels and the IAIC's
concerns at its March 28 meeting that $75,000 was too low to accomplish
anything relative to EV infrastructure, the MSRC revised this
Program to include a minimum funding target for each of the four
counties at $150,000. However, the MSRC anticipates that each
county will submit proposals seeking considerably more than this
amount.
<P>
Since we will be considering the Supplemental FY 1995-97 AB 2766
Discretionary Fund Work Program at our April 12 Board meeting,
I have not included copies of the five RFPs mentioned above to
this report. The submittal deadline for these five RFPs is Tuesday,
May 21, 1996, by 5 p.m.
<P>
<B>Zero-Emission Vehicle &quot;Quick Charge&quot; Program</B>

<P>
This $7 million, three-part Zero-Emission Vehicle &quot;Quick
Charge&quot; Program is progressing well, with considerable interest
from communities, local government, and auto manufacturers. The
MSRC has been coordinating workshops and focus groups to assist
these entities in participating in the Program. In fact, on Tuesday,
April 2, the City of Fontana, in conjunction with the MSRC and
SANBAG, hosted an EV Ready Workshop for communities in that area.
In addition, a &quot;Quick Charge&quot; Bidders' Conference will
be held at the AQMD on Tuesday, April 9, and technical workshops
will also be held at the AQMD on Friday, April 26, and Friday,
May 17.
<P>
<B>Report to the Air Resources Board on the Fiscal Year 1994-95
AB 2766 Discretionary Work Program</B> 
<P>
The MSRC received and approved its portion of the Report to the
ARB on the FY 1994-95 AB 2766 Program. Technical staff assured
the MSRC that the report reflects well on the Committee's work
and that project cost-effectiveness appears well within the guidelines
set forth by the ARB. This Report, detailing two of the three
parts of the AB 2766 Program--the AQMD and the Discretionary Program
portions--is also included on our April 12 Board agenda for consideration.
<P>
<B>Long-Term Funding Sources for SCAG's Rideshare Department Program</B>

<P>
The MSRC discussed this issue relative to SCAG's efforts to identify
funding for its Rideshare Department (formerly Commuter Transportation
Services which merged with SCAG). Proposed amendments to Assembly
Bill 836 (Lewis) includes language regarding voluntary ridesharing
programs, and could result in SCAG assuming responsibility for
the AQMD's Rule 2202. In addition, the Regional Transportation
Advisory Coalition (RTAC--formerly the AB 1246 Committee) recently
discussed what long-term sources may be available for SCAG's Rideshare
Program, and in particular focused on the use of AB 2766 monies
as a funding source.
<P>
For your information, the IAIC also discussed this issue in length
at its March 28 meeting, at which I was present. Without Rule
2202, AQMD staff believes that the State Implementation Plan would
be deficient. Consequently, considerable concern was expressed
that federal transportation sanctions against this Basin could
be the end result.
<P>
<B>Contract Modification Requests</B> 
<P>
As recommended by its Technical Advisory Committee, the MSRC approved
the following contract modifications:
<OL>
<LI>Six-month contractual term extension on City of Glendale Contract
#C94006, which provides $208,000 to develop an LNX Systems Electronic
Banking project;
<P>
<LI>Eighteen-month contractual term extension, with a one-year
performance monitoring period, for Los Angeles/Department of Transportation
Contract #C94016, which provides $296,000 for the purchase of
three electric buses for The Hollywood Dash System;
<P>
<LI>Five and one-half month contractual term extension and adjustment
from monthly to quarterly reporting on Orange County Transportation
Authority Contract #C94039, which provides $100,000 for the development
of a Transportation Analysis Model; and
<P>
<LI>Two-month contractual term extension and a task modification
for Southern California Association of Governments Contract #C95003,
which provides $67,500 for local government workshops on land-use,
transportation, and air quality planning.
</OL>
<P>
The MSRC also denied two requests. First, the Baytech Corporation
discovered an arithmetical error in its heavy-duty vehicle proposal
(#4-2) which resulted in a project cost error of approximately
$54,000. The MSRC was reluctant to award additional funds which
were for the administrative portion of the project, and denied
the request. (The MSRC's award remains at $390,728 for this project.)
Baytech Corporation intends to seek additional co-funding to make
up the deficit, and the project will move forward once under contract.
Second, Acurex Corporation was awarded $489,000 for the purchase
and demonstration of five heavy-duty trucks. Acurex proposed that
the mix of vehicles for this project be changed. However, the
MSRC was reluctant to agree to such a change, such that it would
be considered a major scope change and could have resulted in
Acurex having scored lower during the evaluation process. Therefore,
the MSRC denied the request. Acurex has agreed to complete the
project as originally proposed.
<P>
The MSRC also received and filed a report on &quot;Scope Changes
Handled Administratively by the AQMD Contract Administrator&quot;
for March which included three minor contract modifications for
US Electricar Contract #C94036, which provides $155,000 for an
Electric Vehicle Program with USPS, MRK Planning Consultants Contract
#C95010, which provides $135,965 for the development of a Parking
Management Program, and Diversified Paratransit Contract #C95023,
which provides $150,000 for a taxi link.
<P>
<B>Contract Administrator Report</B> 
<P>
The MSRC's AB 2766 Contract Administrator provided a written status
report on all fiscal year contracts. This Contract Administrator
Report is provided for your information (<I>Attachment 3)</I>.

<B>Proposal:</B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Regulatory Reform Initiative - &quot;Green Carpet&quot; Priority
Permitting Service
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B>Synopsis:</B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
During the last two years, the AQMD has worked closely with a
number of companies to expedite permitting for certain large,
complex projects. This experience has been very successful. The
Board's Regulatory Reform Initiative offers a similar service
to projects that meet certain environmental, technology or job
creation criteria. A pilot project is proposed to evaluate implementation
of this concept. The details of the pilot project have been developed
in collaboration with the California Council for Environmental
and Economic Balance (CCEEB).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B>Committee:</B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Stationary Source, January 19, 1996, Recommended for Approval.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B>Recommended Action:</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Approve the proposal and direct the Executive Officer to report
back to the Board upon completion of one year of program operation
with the results of the pilot study.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=2>PL:CC:DES:eg</FONT>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
<P>
Over the last two years, the AQMD has successfully provided priority
permitting for several large projects. The success was due to
a high level of preliminary discussion between the applicant and
staff, the involvement of very competent consultants, a thorough
and complete submittal by the applicant of the necessary permitting
and California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) information, and
the development of an agreed-upon critical path schedule for the
permitting of the project.
<P>
Last April the Governing Board adopted
the Business Clean Air Partnership. This year the Governing Board
is pursuing Regulatory Reform Initiatives. Part of these plans
call for AQMD to give priority to permits for:
<UL>
<LI>Companies that meet or exceed Year 2010 emission standards
(referred to as &quot;Three Star&quot; facilities); and/or
<P>
<LI>Companies that provide high employment (more than 500
jobs) and low emissions (achieve half of the reductions required
by Year 2010). These companies are referred to as High Employment,
Low Pollution (HELP) Manufacturers.
</UL>
This proposal will implement these commitments.
<P>
The California Council for Environmental and
Economic Balance (CCEEB) has expressed great interest in this
proposal. They seek to provide shorter processing time at a lower
cost to their members. They also believe that this program can
advance economic development opportunities in the region and,
accordingly, have offered to help advertise the service to their
members and their customers.
<P>
During the last few months, staff
has been working with CCEEB to develop the details of this proposal.
A few key recommendations to enhance the program have emerged
from these discussions, namely:
<UL> 
<LI>Expand eligible projects to include &quot;Major Capital
Projects&quot; as defined in the Best Available Control Technology
(BACT) Methodology Report. 
<LI>Name the program &quot;Green Carpet&quot; Priority Permitting
Service and develop advertising and application forms accordingly.

<LI>Establish a project-specific &quot;Green Team&quot; and
establish schedules and application standards that support the
&quot;Priority Permitting Service.&quot;
<LI>Assess cost savings and report back to the Governing Board.
</UL>
<P>
<B>The Green Team Proposal</B>
<P>
The AQMD will provide &quot;Green Carpet&quot;
Priority Permitting Service designed to implement the Board's
Business Clean Air Partnership and Regulatory Reform Initiative.
The permitting of a Green Team project will be given priority
in order to advance clean air and job creation opportunities in
the region.
<P>
<I><U>Applicability </U></I>
<BR>
Projects will be eligible for
&quot;Green Carpet&quot; Priority Permitting Service if they meet
any one of the following criteria:</TT> 


<OL>
<LI>The project shall be a &quot;Three Star&quot; project.
Borrowing a definition from the Business Clean Air Partnership,
these projects shall be defined as the installation or modification
of any source designed to meet or exceed the Year 2010 air emission
standards. 
<P>
<LI>The project shall be a HELP Project. Again, borrowing
a definition from the Business Clean Air Partnership, a HELP Project
is defined as any installation or modification of a source that
creates more than 500 jobs and produces half the emissions per
employee allowed under the Year 2010 goal for that industry.
<P>
<LI>The project shall be a Major Capital Project. These sources
are defined in the BACT guidelines as: 
<UL>
<LI>Project capital cost greater than $10 million;
<LI>Project engineering and construction time exceeding one
year each; 
<LI>Standard design projects only, no unconventional or novel
projects; 
<LI>Design criteria specified sufficient for design engineering;
and, 
<LI>No multi-phase projects.
</UL>
<LI>The project shall be an air quality technology advancement
project and shall comply with the requirements of Rule 441 - Research
Operations which include:
<UL>
<LI>The purpose of the operation is to permit investigation,
experiment or research to advance the state of knowledge or the
state of the art of air quality technology; 
<LI>The AQMD has given written prior approval which shall
include limitation of time; and
<LI>The AQMD shall grant approval only if the operation is
conducted in a manner to minimize emissions into the atmosphere.
</UL>
</OL>
<I><U>Green Team Operations </U></I>
<BR>
Green Team procedures will include the following actions: 


<UL>
<LI>The AQMD shall assign Senior Managers from the Stationary
Source Compliance Division to expedite the permitting of eligible
projects. 
<LI>Once a project has been accepted for priority permitting
service, the AQMD will commit to a service plan for the expected
project permitting and CEQA review (see Exhibit A).
<LI>The applicant shall manage its representatives and the
scheduling of the project.
<LI>The AQMD shall: 
   <UL>
   <LI>advise and assist with permitting issues;
   <LI>provide technical assistance on air pollution control
   equipment and post-operation air quality or rule interpretation
   training (if needed); <BR>

   <LI>provide assistance with BACT and rule requirements; <BR>

   <LI>provide the applicant with a written service plan consistent
   with the Green Team Time Clock (see Exhibits B and C). 
   </UL>
<P>


<LI>When the project has been accepted for Green Team action,
the applicant's representatives shall provide the following:

   <UL>
   <LI>air quality permit analysis that will include, but will
   not be limited to, facility background information, process description,
   emissions quantification, relevant AQMD rule compliance and proposed
   permit conditions; <BR>

   <LI>CEQA analysis and documentation (the applicant is responsible
   for the timely submittal and approval of necessary documents to
   satisfy the State requirements for CEQA review); <BR>

   <LI>final plans regarding construction schedules, consultants,
   and timing for permitting decisions. 
   </UL>

<LI>The AQMD will evaluate the submittals described above
and will provide a preliminary response within 30 days. An additional
15 days will be needed to review any necessary corrections to
these submittals.
<LI>An additional 30-45 days will be allowed for public review
for the CEQA document. If needed, this period will also be used
for public review of the permitting activities.
<P>
<LI>An additional 30-45 days will be allowed to respond to
public comments and to submit the necessary permit and CEQA documentation
to the Executive Officer for review, consideration and an approval
determination.
</UL>
<P>
<B>Implementation</B>
<P>
Upon approval by the Governing
Board, the service described above shall undergo a pilot study.
This study for priority permitting service shall be announced
in the <I>AQMD Advisor</I> and shall: 
<UL>
<LI>Establish Green Team schedules and applications.

<LI>Establish guidance for completeness of Green Team submittals
to reduce the need for time-consuming engineering evaluations.

<LI>Evaluate interface with the Certified Permitting Professional
program.
 
<LI>Evaluate the permitting costs for each Green Team project.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Analysis of AQMD Treasury Management Options
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B>Synopsis:</B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This report identifies and evaluates various treasury management
options available to the AQMD, including the costs and benefits
of implementing each option. Over the last several months the
Administrative Committee has been reviewing AQMD's investment
and cash management programs performed by the County of Los Angeles.
Based upon concerns highlighted by the Orange County bankruptcy,
the Administrative Committee has directed staff to provide to
the Board an objective comparison of the various treasury management
options available to the AQMD and the costs, risks, and benefits
associated with each recommendation.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B>Committee:</B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Administrative, February 16, 1996, recommended for approval.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B>Recommended Action:</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Adopt the Administrative Committee's recommendation directing
staff to implement Option II creating an in-house AQMD treasury
management function and return to the Board for specific approval
authorizing:
<UL>
<LI>Establishment of an Investment Oversight Committee
<LI>Initiation of the selection of a Financial Advisor
<LI>Development of an AQMD Investment Policy and Guidelines
<LI>Initiation of the selection of new Banking and Custodial services
<LI>Initiation of the selection of an Independent Investment Management
Firm
<LI>Appointment of a new AQMD Treasurer

Executive Officer
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>PHP:jmk</FONT>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<B>Background</B> 
<P>
Since the AQMD was created in 1977, the County of Los Angeles,
under a General Services Agreement, has provided the AQMD with
treasury management services which include the processing of payroll
and accounts payable warrants and the investment of the AQMD's
cash balances. AQMD's cash balances are currently held in eight
separate funds in trust with the County and are segregated for
accounting purposes from other funds maintained by the Treasurer
for Los Angeles County, cities, and other special districts. Prior
to September 1995, all AQMD funds held by the County Treasurer
were invested in the County's $7.0 billion Pooled Surplus Investment
Portfolio (PSIP). In September 1995, the AQMD directed the Los
Angeles County Treasurer to invest up to $20 million of the AQMD's
funds in the Local Agency Investment Fund (LAIF), which is a $8.0
billion pooled investment fund managed by the California State
Treasurer. As of December 31, 1995, the AQMD had $51.4 million
invested in the PSIP and $19.5 invested in LAIF.
<P>
<B>Policy Issues</B> 
<P>
The Administrative Committee has been evaluating the financial
risks to the AQMD because of its participation in the County's
PSIP should the County declare insolvency as a result of its budgetary
problems. At its December meeting the Administrative Committee
directed staff to report back to the full Board regarding the
costs and risks associated with the treasury management options
available to the AQMD.
<P>
The AQMD has received a reasoned analysis from outside legal counsel
regarding the bankruptcy risks to the AQMD funds invested in the
Los Angeles County PSIP. This analysis made a significant distinction
between the commingled funds in the PSIP and separate accounts
in a bankruptcy situation, and expressed that the risks to AQMD
funds invested in separate noncommingled investments would be
greatly reduced.
<P>
Based on this legal analysis and the attached report prepared
by outside financial advisors, staff has developed two recommended
treasury management options, each with different benefits and
costs, which are responsive to the varying degree of perceived
risk associated with Los Angeles County solvency. Both options
reduce the solvency risks associated with the AQMD's participation
in the County's PSIP by moving a significant portion of our investments
out of the County's commingled pool and taking a more active role
in the short-and-intermediate term investment market. Option I
is recommended if the Board perceives the solvency risk to be
low and Option II is recommended if the Board believes that the
risk is high.
<P>
<I><U>Option I: Los Angeles County Treasury Management</U></I> - preserves
the current benefits of low cost banking and investment services
with greater diversification, oversight and control. This option
proposes placing approximately 85% of our investments into separate
accounts outside of the PSIP (into LAIF and the County's Special
Purpose Investment Portfolio) to minimize commingling
<P>
<I><U>Option II - AQMD Treasury Management</U></I> - requires the appointment
of a new internal Treasurer, new expanded banking services, higher
oversight and control responsibilities, modest increase in investment
risk, potential of increased earnings and higher banking and investment
service costs. This option proposes maintaining short-term investments
in both the PSIP and LAIF, plus actively managing through an outside
portfolio manager an intermediate-term investment account.
<P>
It is important to note that the Los Angeles County PSIP currently
and historically has had a conservative Investment Policy and
Guidelines, a conservative investment program strategy and experienced
management and investment staff. The PSIP is the second largest
pooled investment program in California, exceeded only by the
Pooled Money Investment Account of the State of California. Because
of its size and conservative investment policy the PSIP provides
its participants a solid return from an investment program which
emphasizes safety and liquidity at low administrative cost. Both
recommended options include a continued modest level of participation
in the PSIP because of the safety and daily liquidity provided
by the PSIP to meet AQMD payroll and accounts payable demands.
<P>
<B>Resource Impacts</B> 
<P>
The two treasury management options recommended for Board consideration
carry additional costs of approximately $20,000 for Option I to
approximately $165,000 for Option II annually.

<P>
<B>Background</B> 
<P>
The AQMD Governing Board amended Regulation XIII - New Source
Review on December 7, 1995. At that time, the Governing Board
deferred some issues including Federal Class I areas protection
of visibility and notification to Federal Land Managers (FLMs),
which are requirements of federal law and are designed to protect
visibility in pristine areas, such as national parks and national
forests. There are six Federal Class I areas in the AQMD, namely:
Agua Tibia, Cucamonga, Joshua Tree, San Gabriel, San Gorgonio
and San Jacinto. Attachment A contains a map showing the locations
of these six areas. The United States Forest Service and the National
Park Service are the two FLMs that supervise these six Federal
Class I areas in the AQMD.
<P>
The objective of the protection of visibility and FLM notification
requirements is to ensure that the construction of a new major
source or modification of an existing major source does not adversely
impact the visibility of Federal Class I areas. Such visibility
impacts may be caused by the formation of a visible plume or regional
haze. The proposal maintains the air quality objectives of Regulation
XIII - New Source Review (NSR) and Regulation XX - Regional Clean
Air Incentives Market (RECLAIM) while facilitating the ability
to new and modified existing sources to comply with the NSR requirements.
The overall emission reduction potential of Regulation XIII -
New Source Review (NSR)and Regulation XX - Regional Clean Air
Incentives Market (RECLAIM) are not expected to change as a result
of these proposed amendments.
<P>
The staff proposal to amend Rule 1303 - Requirements and Rule
2005 - New Source Review for RECLAIM, will help make the AQMD's
NSR program and RECLAIM approvable by EPA for inclusion in the
SIP, without unnecessary administrative burden to facilities or
government agencies involved. Subsequent amendments to NSR regulations
will address the other items that were deferred from the December
7, 1995 Board meeting.
<P>
<B>Proposal</B> 
<P>
Protection of visibility and FLM notification requirements are
related to the definitions of &quot;major polluting facility&quot;
and &quot;major modification.&quot; The AQMD has extremely low
thresholds for these definitions because federal and state law
have designated the AQMD Basin as being an extreme nonattainment
area of air quality standards. If these thresholds were used to
require new and modified sources to protection of visibility and
FLM notification requirements, thousands of permits each year
could potentially be affected. The administrative burden would
overwhelm the regulated community, the AQMD, and the FLMs, with
potentially little benefit. The AQMD has worked with the federal
EPA, Forest Service, National Park Service, and industry in an
attempt to reduce the regulatory and administrative burden of
these requirements without compromising the CAA goals for protection
of visibility in Federal Class I areas. This work has led to the
development of applicability criteria for these requirements based
on extensive modeling and other CAA requirements.
<P>
The staff proposal requires visibility analysis for visible plumes
and FLM notification only for new or modified major sources that
emit PM10 or NOx in excess of 15 tons/year of PM10 or 40 tons/year
of NOx and are located within specific distances of Federal Class
I areas in the AQMD. The applicable emission thresholds for PM10
and NOx correspond to the trigger levels for major modifications
in areas which are in attainment of the relevant NAAQS, namely,
15 tons/year of PM10 and 40 tons/year of NOx. All other criteria
pollutants do not affect plume formation or regional haze and
therefore, are not part of this analysis. The only applicable
pollutant for Rule 2005 is NOx since PM10 is not subject to Regulation
XX - RECLAIM. Visible plume modeling is required only for projects
that meet or exceed the clearly established emission thresholds
and proximity values from Federal Class I areas. The proposed
rule amendment also contains requirements for visible plume modeling
and specifies certain technical parameters to be used.
<P>
If initial modeling identifies potential adverse impacts on visible
plumes in a Federal Class I area, additional detailed modeling
is required. The rule provides guidance to the Executive Officer
relative to permitting and noticing actions, and specifies time
limits for FLM review actions so that permit applications are
not unduly impacted. In the very unlikely event that a new or
modified major stationary source is expected to cause an adverse
impact on visibility in a Federal Class I area, the Executive
Officer may be required to deny the permit. The applicant always
has the option of modifying the project or providing mitigations
to obviate any potential adverse impact on visibility, in order
to obtain a permit from the AQMD. Attachment B shows the permit
action flowcharts for both proposed rules which captures the essence
of this proposal.
<P>
<B>AQMP &amp; Legal Mandates</B> 
<P>
The AQMD is required to comply with federal and state NSR requirements,
including visibility protection analysis and notification of FLMs
as set forth in the CAA. This proposal meets these requirements
without an undue administrative burden to industry, the AQMD,
or other agencies.
<P>
<B>CEQA &amp; Socioeconomic Analysis</B> 
<P>
The AQMD has reviewed the proposed projects pursuant to CEQA Guidelines
Section 15002(k) - Three-Step Process, to determine which type
of CEQA document to prepare for the proposed action. The AQMD
has determined that the proposed amendments are exempt from CEQA
pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Section 15308 - Action by Regulatory
Agencies for the Protection of the Environment, since the activity
is covered by this Class 8 exemption for actions to assure the
maintenance, restoration, enhancement, or protection of the environment.
<P>
The Notice of Exemption, prepared pursuant to state CEQA Guidelines
Section 15062 - Notice of Exemption, will be filed with the county
clerks of Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties
immediately following the adoption of the proposal.
<P>
A socioeconomic impact assessment will be prepared for part of
the adopt hearing package. The approach proposed in the rule is
not expected to result in significant financial impact on facilities
and will result in much lower compliance costs than if the rule
were implemented at a lower threshold.
<P>
<B>Implementation Plan</B> 
<P>
AQMD permitting staff are responsible for implementation of NSR,
while AQMD planning staff can assist with modeling analyses. Staff
will be trained on the changes to Regulation XIII and will provide
technical assistance to applicants regarding the new requirements
for modeling and FLM notifications. The FLMs are committed to
review visibility modeling results and provide written comments
to the Executive Officer for projects that meet the applicability
thresholds contained in Proposed Amended Rules 1303 and 2005.
<P>
<B>Resource Impact</B> 
<P>
Current AQMD resources are sufficient to implement the proposed
rule amendments rules with negative budget impact.

AQMD is seeking EPA approval for the inclusion of the 1994 AQMP
and SIP submittal into the State Implementation Plan. Prior to
approval, AQMD must submit a revised adoption schedule for the
1994 SIP control measures contained in the 1996 Rule Forecast
Report (April 1996 version). The 1994 AQMP control measures in
the 1996 Rule Forecast Report and provided in this package shall
serve as the Amended Control Measure Adoption Schedule.

<B>Background</B> 
<P>
AQMD is seeking EPA approval for inclusion of the 1994 AQMP and
SIP submittal into the State Implementation Plan. EPA has expressed
concern that the 1994 AQMP control measures scheduled for adoption
in 1994 and 1995 have not yet been brought to the Board for action.
EPA indicated a willingness to accept the attached adoption schedule
as the basis for final approval of the 1994 AQMP into the SIP.
To amend the SIP, the proposed rule schedule was required to be
publicly noticed at least 30 days before approval of the amendment.
This requirement has been satisfied.
<P>
<B>Proposal</B> 
<P>
Staff has deleted the proposed rules not included in the 1994
AQMP, and hence, not part of the SIP approval process by EPA.
This schedule will be forwarded to EPA for its final approval
of the SIP submittal.

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
James M. Lents, Ph.D.<BR>
Executive Office
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>BW:CLW:CD:ENL</FONT>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<B>Background</B> 
<P>
At the time of adopting Rule 2202 - On-Road Motor Vehicle Mitigation
Options, the Governing Board directed that additional analysis
on the fees for participation in the Air Quality Investment Program
(AQIP) be performed. The AQIP is one of the compliance options
available under Rule 2202. The AQIP is designed to allow all regulated
employers to meet their emission equivalency target through this
program, should they so choose.
<P>
Upon registering under this option and submitting the designated
investment amount, an employer is considered to be in compliance
with the rule and there is no need for further action to reduce
mobile source emissions. The monies are placed into an AQMD-administered
restricted fund. The collected monies are to be used to fund alternative
mobile source emission reduction strategies that reduce mobile
source emissions at a more cost-effective rate and that potentially
could result in greater overall emission reductions.
<P>
In effect, an employer using the AQIP compliance option is transferring
to the AQMD the responsibility to achieve emission reductions
equivalent to the pooled emission reduction targets of all employers
participating in the fund. The AQMD becomes an intermediary responsible
for funding programs that will obtain, through the contract process,
equivalent emission reductions/air quality improvements.
<P>
At its December 1995 meeting, the Governing Board directed that
additional information on the most appropriate schedule for AQIP
fees be developed and that a public hearing be scheduled to further
consider the fee amendments. Any change to the fee amounts could
be made by simply adjusting the dollar values found in Rule 2202
(f)(7)(A) and (B) (see Attachment A).
<P>
The concept of the AQIP initially was introduced in Rule 1501.1
as one of the alternative compliance strategies to the rescinded
rideshare rule (Rule 1501). The annual AQIP fee established in
Rule 1501.1 is $110 per employee who reports to the worksite during
the 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. peak window. This fee was based on the findings
of the 1992 Ernst &amp; Young survey conducted to assess the basin-wide
average cost of implementing a rideshare plan. Rule 1501.1 went
into effect July 1, 1995. Implementation experience during the
first quarter after the rule's adoption revealed that the AQIP
emission reduction goals can be achieved significantly more cost-effectively
compared to the $110 per employee fee level established in Rule
1501.1 by implementing emission reduction strategies such as old-vehicle
scrapping. As a result, when the AQIP was included as a compliance
option in Rule 2202, the AQIP fees were lowered by approximately
45% and 62% for annual and triennial compliance options, respectively.
<P>
<B>Proposal</B> 
<P>
Staff proposes to maintain the AQIP fees at current levels until
further implementation experience is gained. Amendments to Regulation
III - Fees later this year will reflect this action. A new Rule
311 will be proposed to address the AQIP specifically, and will
deal with the unique feature of fees established by market forces.
In the event that Rule 311 is not adopted, the AQIP will continue
to be subject to Rule 306.
<P>
Subparagraph (f)(7) transfers the AQIP fee schedule to Regulation
III starting July 1, 1996. Thus, the Board will have an opportunity
to reevaluate the AQIP fee schedule annually at mid-year.
<P>
<B>Policy Issues</B> 
<P>
The current AQIP fees are set towards the lower end of the cost
range as established by market conditions. However, other options
under Rule 2202 are also more cost-effective than the $110 per
employee previously estimated. The estimate of the AQIP fee should
also consider implementation of options other than old-vehicle
scrapping.
<P>
Staff conducted a survey of AQMD-certified scrappers to further
document the current cost of old-vehicle scrapping and to establish
a &quot;default&quot; estimate of annual cost per employee relative
to the cost of participating in the AQIP. The emission credits
from old-vehicle scrapping for Rule 2202 compliance can be priced
per vehicle, per employee, per pound of emission, or per year.
The implementation cost for an employer will vary significantly
depending on the number of employees to be covered or the number
of years for which credits are being secured. The contract cost
for old-vehicle scrapping includes the old-vehicle purchase price,
staffing, advertising, and other administrative costs. Usually
the contract cost of scrapping is equated in per-vehicle terms.
<P>
The survey revealed that old-vehicle scrapping currently costs
between $700 to $1,000 per vehicle depending on the number of
vehicles to be purchased and the service provider. The price per
vehicle equates to a three year cost of $99 to $144 per employee
per year (Attachment B). This range is based on variances such
as economies of scale and model year of the vehicles scrapped.
<P>
Purchasing old-vehicle scrapping emission credits for only one
year would incur a 40% increase in cost, added to the annualized
three-year cost per employee per year. This results in a one year
cost between $46 to $67 per employee for the purchase of emission
credits from old-vehicle scrapping. The increase results from
scrappers having to encumber funds for the second and third year
credits, and the risk of holding limited life emission credits
which may reduce their marketability in future years.
<P>
Staff has reviewed the overall program cost from scrapping through
the creation of the MSERC. Based on past experience with AQIP
submittals and review of current market strategies, the present
per employee pricing structure of $60 annually and $125 triennially
appears to be a reasonable rate at this time. This pricing strategy
accounts for differences in economies of scale, one-year versus
three-year purchase commitments, and AQMD administrative costs.
Furthermore, the rule pricing structure would continue to make
direct vehicle scrapping purchases, without AQMD participation,
a viable alternative to some employers. An employer who uses the
scrapping option will be directly responsible for eliminating
the emissions from high-polluting vehicles.

<P>
<B>CEQA &amp; Socioeconomic Analysis</B> 
<P>
Relative to consideration of adjusting the Rule 2202 fees, the
AQMD has reviewed the proposed project pursuant to California
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Guidelines Section 15002(k) -
Three Step Process, to determine which type of CEQA document to
prepare for the proposed action. The AQMD has determined that
any action relative to adjustment of fees is exempt from CEQA
pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Section 15061(b)(3) - Review for Exemption,
since the activity is covered by the general rule that CEQA applies
only to projects which have the potential for causing a significant
effect on the environment.

</BLOCKQUOTE><P>  James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<BR>  Executive Officer
<P><FONT SIZE=-1>PL:AG:GQ:RAR</FONT>
<P><HR>
<P><B>Background</B>
<P>Regulation XIII - New Source Review, consists of nine rules which, together
with Rule 2005 - New Source Review for RECLAIM, set forth a pre-construction
review program for new or modified sources located in the AQMD.  The objective
of the AQMD's NSR program is to ensure that the construction of new sources
and the modification of existing sources does not interfere with progress
towards attainment and maintenance of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards,
and that future economic growth in the AQMD is not unnecessarily restricted.
<P>The AQMD's Governing Board amended Regulation XIII on December 7, 1995.
 At that time, the Governing Board deferred some items and instructed staff
to return with further recommendations in early 1996.  The proposed amendments
fulfill this Board directive and further streamline the NSR permitting process.
<P>The staff proposal covers the following items:
<P>1) technical clarifications for portable internal combustion engines (ICEs),
emission calculations, relocation of equipment or facilities, eligibility
to use the facility offset exemption, definition of Best Available Control
Technology (BACT), and the use of actual or permitted emissions for NSR
determinations;
<BR>
2) additional flexibility under EPA proposed revisions to NSR rules;
<BR>
3) privately-owned and -operated landfills' access to Priority Reserve credits;
<BR>
 4) compliance certification;
<BR>
5) equity of eliminating the requirement to offset positive NSR balances;
and, 
<BR>
 6) exemption from offset for facilities using methyl bromide as a fumigant.
<P>The sixth issue regarding exemption from offset for facilities using methyl
bromide as a fumigant was not presented to the Governing Board as part of
the December 1995 amendments to Regulation XIII.  However, this is an issue
that has been under evaluation since October of last year and is being brought
to the Board for consideration as part of the proposed amendments.
<P>The proposed amendments maintain the air quality objectives of the current
regulation while facilitating the ability of new and modified sources to
comply with NSR requirements.  The overall emission reduction potential of
NSR is not expected to change as a result of these amendments.
<P><B>Proposal</B>
<P>1) <U>Technical Clarifications</U>
<P> NSR provides an exemption from modeling and offsets for portable equipment
and portable ICEs.  As currently written, this exemption states that a source
must be periodically relocated and may not be located for more than one year
at any one facility.  The proposed amendments clarify that the one-year residency
limit means a consecutive twelve-month period (both portable equipment and
portable ICEs).  For portable ICEs such residency period starts when the
equipment is brought into the facility for operation or removed from storage
and placed in operation.  Further, the proposed amendments clarify that
designated storage areas for portable ICEs must be defined and operations
records maintained for compliance determination.
<P> Procedures in Rule 1306 - Emission Calculations have been clearly stated
so that past actual emissions are not discounted to BACT levels for the purpose
of calculating emission increases when an existing source is modified.
<P> In response to public comments, the term "relocated" has been removed
from the facility offset exemption of Rule 1304 - Exemptions, subparagraph
(d)(2), since this provision is already handled elsewhere in Rule 1304 (c)(1).
<P> Small business advocates correctly pointed out that subparagraph (d)(2)(C)
of Rule 1304 may unnecessarily restrict access to the facility offset exemption
by limiting this offset exemption to facilities in existence prior to December
7, 1995, which was not intended by staff.  Staff is, therefore, proposing
to eliminate this language so that facilities with post-modification
potential-to-emit below specified emission thresholds can access this exemption.
<P> Staff is not proposing revisions to the definition of BACT at this time.
 Staff investigated the use of actual emissions instead of potential-to-emit
in this context and discovered that the use of actual emissions in this case
would be problematic and federally non-compliant, and cause unnecessary
additional recordkeeping and reporting burdens.  The Small Business BACT
provision was not intended to apply to major polluting facilities with a
potential-to-emit at or above the major source thresholds but the proposed
change to actual emissions would have conferred a benefit to major polluting
facilities and abrogate federal CAA Sections 171 and 173 requirements for
NSR.
<P>2) <U>Additional Flexibility</U>
<P> EPA recently proposed additional flexibility in proposed revisions to
federal NSR rules.  Staff is investigating those options and will return
to the Board with further recommendations as soon as EPA's intent is clarified.
 This is optimistically expected to occur in early 1997, according to EPA
sources.
<P>3) <U>Private vs. Public Landfills</U>
<P> Staff initially proposed to delete privately-owned and -operated landfills
from the definition of an essential public service and thus remove their
access to the Priority Reserve.  In spite of this exemption, the AQMD must
offset on a 1.2-to-1 ratio such emission increases with creditable emission
decreases from other sources.  After discussing this issue with industry
representatives, staff determined that, at this time, the amount of NSR emission
increases from privately-owned and privately-operated landfills is not warranted
because such emissions do not cause an imbalance in the AQMD's showing of
equivalency with state and federal requirements as was first expected.  Thus,
staff is proposing no change to the existing definition of an essential public
service but will re-evaluate the situation with the annual status report
to the Board, as required by NSR rules.
<P>4) <U>Compliance Certification</U>
<P> At the December 7, 1995 Public Hearing, Rule 1303 - Requirements (NSR)
was amended to include the requirement for a statewide compliance certification
for new major stationary sources or major modifications at existing major
stationary sources.  Staff was requested to investigate whether this requirement
could be implemented in a streamlined manner by providing a one-year life
to a compliance certification and the future merger of this provision with
a similar requirement for Title V facility permit holders.  Staff agrees
with the request, and is communicating with EPA, Region IX, to seek their
concurrence on this approach.
<P>5) <U>Equity Adjustment</U>
<P> At the last NSR rule amendment, the Board forgave all emission debts
from existing sources by eliminating the requirement to offset positive NSR
balances as a prerequisite for obtaining a permit for a new or modified source.
 Ultramar, a petroleum refinery, requested an "equity" adjustment at that
time because they had provided external offsets to repay their emission debt
in the past, and considered themselves at a competitive disadvantage to other
petroleum refineries who would now not have to repay their emissions debt.
 Based on a policy decision from the AQMD Governing Board, staff is proposing
an offset exemption for such facilities that provided emission reduction
credits (ERCs) to comply with the past requirement to offset positive NSR
balances.  The amount of offset exemption is proposed to be equal to the
amount of ERCs provided to offset positive NSR balances since October 1990,
and can be utilized for future emission increases subject to NSR rules at
that facility.  It should be noted that, although emission increases exempted
from offsets are only 0.01, 0.2, and 0.04 tons per day of VOC, CO, and PM10,
respectively, AQMD must show creditable emission decreases of an equivalent
amount, as required by state and federal NSR rules and requirements.
<P>6) <U>Methyl Bromide Offset Exemption</U>
<P> Staff proposes that methyl bromide fumigation equipment be exempt from
the offset requirements of AQMD's NSR program.  There are four companies
in the AQMD permitting system using methyl bromide to fumigate commodities,
such as cotton, fruits and vegetables.  The federal Clean Air Act requires
the phase-out of methyl bromide production as an upper atmospheric ozone
depleting compound by the turn of this century, and the state is also
investigating a similar ban due to its associated health risk.  However,
this is a hotly debated issue with little or no cost-effective control options
or replacement compounds available today.  Staff proposal requires AQMD to
show creditable emission decreases to offset an estimated increase of 0.7
tons per day of VOC resulting from this action.
<P><B>AQMP &amp; Legal Mandates</B>
<P>AQMD is required to comply with federal and state NSR requirements.  The
proposed amendments streamline the NSR permitting process and meet the air
quality objectives of the NSR requirements of state and federal law.
<P><B>CEQA Analysis</B>
<P>Pursuant to state California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Guidelines
and AQMD's Certified Regulatory Program (Rule 110), staff prepared appropriate
CEQA documentation, consisting of a Draft Supplemental Environmental Assessment
(EA).  The Draft Supplemental EA has been circulated for a 30-day public
review and comment period which ends April 23, 1996.  A Final Supplemental
EA will be prepared and will include responses to all comments received on
the draft document.
<P><B>Implementation Plan</B>
<P>Permitting staff will be trained on the changes to Rule 1304 - Exemptions
and Rule 1306 - Emission Calculations (NSR).  Any required modifications
to the NSR Tracking System will be performed by AQMD's Information Management
with the assistance of the NSR policy development team.
<P><B>Resource Impact</B>
<P>Current AQMD resources are sufficient to implement the proposed rule
amendments with no budget impact.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Set Public Hearing June 14, 1996 to Amend Rule 1136 - Wood Products
Coatings.
</BLOCKQUOTE><P> James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<BR> Executive Officer
<P><FONT SIZE=-1>PL:JPB:MLK:LHM</FONT>
<P><HR>
<P><B>Background</B>
<P>Rule 1136 - Wood Products Coatings was originally adopted on September
16, 1983, and subsequently amended many times to help implement our AQMP
and address issues raised by industry, the USEPA and others.  The purpose
of the rule is to reduce VOC emissions from the use of coatings and strippers
on wood products, including furniture, cabinets, shutters, frames and toys.
 The rule does not apply to residential non-commercial operations.
<P>The rule was amended in September 1988 to achieve an 83% VOC emission
reduction through the introduction of technology-forcing VOC content limits
for several coating steps which required the conversion from traditional
coatings to lower-VOC coatings.  The last three rule amendments of April
1994, August 1994, and September 1995, have allowed the industry more time
to make the transition to low-VOC coatings.
<P>At the last Rule 1136 public hearing on September 8, 1995, the Governing
Board, because of continued objections by much of the wood industry, delayed
the final VOC limits until July 1, 1996, and directed staff to form a working
group with industry to address issues involving Rule 1136.
<P>Since that time, staff has:
<P>&#183; Formed a Rule 1136 Working Group that has met five times;
<P>&#183; Met three times with a group of wood coating formulators;
<P>&#183; Conducted site visits to 22 wood coaters and three coating
manufacturers;
<P>&#183; Hired a consultant to conduct detailed surveys of a sample of wood
coaters and most wood coating manufacturers;
<P>&#183; Evaluated USEPA's proposed control technology guideline (CTG) model
rule for wood furniture (commonly referred to as "reg neg");
<P>&#183; Assessed the availability and feasibility of low-VOC wood coatings;
and
<P>&#183; Held a Rule 1136 Public Workshop.
<P>Staff's general conclusions and recommendations are as follows:
<P>&#183; The 18% emission reduction from the present Rule 1136 VOC limits
in affect prior to July 1, 1996 that the "reg neg" limits would achieve is
much less than what is achievable by industry, and falls short of what is
required by the AQMP.
<P>&#183; Compliance with all of the current Rule 1136 VOC limits by July
1, 1996, by all of the wood coating industry, would be difficult.
<P>&#183; The majority of the emission reduction to be achieved by the final
limits of the current rule can be accomplished by establishing interim VOC
limits for some coating categories based on reformulation with acetone.
<P>&#183; The final VOC limits and exemptions should be extended until 2005;
and
<P>&#183; More options and flexibility could assist wood coating operations
to comply with the limits.
<P><B>Policy Issues</B>
<P>The local wood product coating industry has requested that Rule 1136 VOC
limits be replaced with VOC limits from the USEPA-proposed CTG "reg neg."
 Representing "Reasonably Available Control Technology" (RACT), "reg neg"
would achieve only a 18% VOC emission reduction compared to current VOC limits.
 Rule 1136 is the last coating rule currently allowing general use of high-VOC
coatings.  Facilities in the AQMD using low-VOC coatings have reduced their
VOC emissions by more than 85% compared to the current VOC limits.  The
"reg neg" is not adequate because:  (a) it does not reflect the emission
reductions that are actually achievable; (b) it is not a fair share of the
70% VOC emission reduction required for all stationary sources between 1990
and 2010 (1994 AQMP); and (c) state law requires the AQMD to adopt "Best
Available Retrofit Control Technology" (BARCT), a higher standard than RACT.
 The proposed amended Rule 1136 is BARCT.
<P><B>Proposal</B>
<P>The proposed amendments to Rule 1136 reflect staff's technical assessment
and address issues raised by industry relative to the availability and
feasibility of low-VOC coating technology.  The proposed amendments include:
<P>&#183; Delaying the final VOC limits until 2005;
<P>&#183; Establishing interim VOC limits achievable with acetone-reformulated
coatings;
<P>&#183; Providing alternative VOC limits to accommodate facilities already
using, or that could use, a hybrid waterborne topcoat and solvent-borne sealer
system.
<P>&#183; Raising the final VOC limits for sealers and high-solids stains;
<P>&#183; Investment Program (AQIP) for stationary sources similar to the
one under Rule 2202 - On Road Vehicle Mitigation Options;
<P>&#183; Allowing use of alternate spray application equipment if compliant
coatings are used;
<P>&#183; Extending the exemptions for the coating of classic guitars;
refinishing, replacement and custom replica furniture; and touch-up and repair;
<P>&#183; Increasing the flexibility of emissions averaging;
<P>&#183; Updating test methods and definitions; and
<P>&#183; Including a new VOC limit format of pounds of VOC per pound of
solids, as used by the federal "reg neg."
<P>The proposed amended rule will reduce wood product coating VOC emissions
by 5.0 tons per day (45%) by 1997 and 8.9 tons per day (81%) by 2005.
<P>USEPA has approved the September 1995 amendments to Rule 1136 that delayed
the final limits to July 1, 1996, as part of the State Implementation Plan.
 However, USEPA has expressed concerns about further delays in the emission
reductions, and emissions averaging in the proposed amendments.  Staff is
continuing to work with USEPA to resolve their issues.
<P><B>AQMP and Legal Mandates</B>
<P>On October 14, 1994, the Governing Board adopted a resolution that requires
staff to address whether proposed rules being considered for adoption are
scheduled such that the most cost-effective proposed rules, as defined in
the 1994 AQMP, are submitted to the Board prior to less cost-effective proposals.
 The proposed amendments are not included in the 1994 AQMP and will not achieve
additional emission reductions.  Rather, they delay compliance with existing
rules and result in a delay of previously approved emission reductions and
associated costs.
<P>The delay in the final emission reductions until 2005 will not jeopardize
attainment of the ozone standard by 2010.  A delay in emission reductions
would not interfere with either the near term or long term reasonable further
progress (RFP) demonstration.  Staff will reassess the Basin-wide RFP as
part of the 1997 AQMP, due in July 1996, including the proposed amended Rule
1136.
<P><B>California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA)</B>
<P>AQMD staff has reviewed the proposed amendments to Rule 1136 - Wood Products
Coatings, and has determined that the delay in the final compliance date
for the aforementioned wood coatings will result in a delay of future VOC
emission reductions.  This delay of future emission reduction is considered
to be significant under CEQA.  A Draft Subsequent Environmental Assessment
(EA) was prepared and circulated for a 45-day public review and comment period
ending on April 29, 1996.
<P><B>Socioeconomic Analysis</B>
<P>The proposed amendments would require affected facilities to submit a
Progress Report demonstrating their strategy to meet the final, July 1, 2005
compliance limits.  The cost of report preparation will be minimal to the
affected facilities.
<P>Overall, the proposed amendments would allow more time for the wood coating
industry to comply with the final VOC limits, thereby deferring some compliance
costs.  USEPA estimates that the cost of conversion to a complete waterborne
coating system ranges from $1,933 to $2,972 per ton ("Control of VOC Emissions
from Wood Furniture Manufacturing Operations," July 1995).  The
cost-effectiveness of acetone-reformulated coatings is about $1,600 per ton.
<P><B>Implementation Plan</B>
<P>Staff will be trained on the changes to this rule.  A notice will be sent
to wood coaters informing them of the rule amendments and contact persons
for assistance.
<P><B>Resource Impact</B>
<P>Existing AQMD resources will be sufficient for implementation of the changes
to these rules with no impact on the budget.

BOARD MEETING DATE:  May 10, 1996 <BR>
AGENDA NO. 5
<P>
<B>Proposal:</B> <BR>
<blockquote>Approve Purchase of AQMD's Telecommunication Services</blockquote>
<P>
<B>Synopsis:</B> <BR>
<blockquote>On November 17, 1995, the Board approved release of an RFP for
Telecommunications Services.  Dividing the purchase of required
telecommunications services among GTE (local phone services),
L.A. Cellular (cellular phone services), and MCI (long distance

<B>Background</B>
<P>
On November 17, 1995, the Board approved the release of an RFP
for Telecommunication Services.  The purpose of this RFP was to
solicit and identify vendor(s) capable of providing all local
and wide-area telecommunications services to the AQMD, to reduce
current expenses for voice communication services, and to optimize
use of the installed voice communications network. 
<P>
In accordance with the District's Consultant Selection Policy
and Procedure, a public notice inviting bids was published in
the Los Angeles Times, Orange County Register, Riverside Press
Enterprise, San Bernardino Sun, L.A. Sentinel, La Opinion, AQMD
BBS, AQMD's Internet Home Page, The M/W/DVBE Source, Rafu Shimpo,
Chinese Daily News, Korea Central Daily, Eastern Group Publishers,
Precinct Reporter, El Chicano, The Black Voice News, The Excelsior,
and the RFP/Bid Information Line.  Copies of the RFP were requested
by and mailed to 55 telecommunication vendors (Attachment A).
<P>
<B>Bid Evaluation</B>
<P>
When the bidding closed on December 22, 1995, responses had been
received from five firms.  No MBE/WBE/DVBE companies responded
to this RFP.  Of the five respondents, four were judged technically
qualified.  Since none of the bidders could offer all services,
the bid evaluation was split into three parts:  local telephone
service, cellular phone service, and long distance and other telecommunication
services.  Proposals were evaluated by a five-member evaluation
panel consisting of three females and two males; one Hispanic,
one Asian American and three Caucasians; all AQMD staff.
<P>
Only GTE currently is able to offer local telephone service. 
GTE was the only bidder to include maintenance services on the
District's Meridian SL1 PBX switch as well as local phone services
and combination of 250 Analog phone lines into 9 GTE T1 lines
to reduce the costs associated with phone line facility charges.
 Both MCI and L.A. Cellular offered cellular phone services. 
The evaluation results for cellular services are shown in Attachment
B.  Both Sprint and MCI offered long distance phone service and
various combinations of additional services such as InterLATA
and Interstate access, Frame Relay, Internet access, ISDN, 800
numbers, and Calling Card service.  The evaluation results for
these vendors are shown in Attachment C, with MCI ranked first.
 Four T1 lines from ACLA and Sprint will be replaced with three
MCI T1 lines for long-distance and network access services, and
thirteen 800 phone numbers (five lines from GTE, one from AT&amp;T,
and seven from MCI) will be replaced with a single 800 phone number
(1-800-CUT-SMOG).  All 800 lines will be rolled over to MCI to
ensure full advantage of volume discounts.  Attachment D details
the proposed change in 800 phone numbers and lines.

<BLOCKQUOTE>The Coordinating Research Council (CRC), with AQMD's cofunding,
conducted
a nationwide tunnel study in 1995 that included the Sepulveda and Van Nuys
tunnels.  The proposed contract with CRC will be a follow-up study at the

<P><HR>
<P><B>Background</B>
<P>Mobile sources are responsible for a large percentage of the region's
air quality problem.  In 1995, the CRC, with cofunding from the AQMD and
other entities, conducted a nationwide tunnel study entitled, "High Exhaust
Emitters Project Site Characterization/-Selection/Feasibility Study" at five
different locations, which included the Sepulveda and Van Nuys tunnels. 
The purpose of the study was to obtain improved emissions data and a broadened
database from various types of fleets to better estimate mobile source emissions.
 During the 1995 study, the Southern California fleet was operating on
transitional gasoline.
<P>As of March 1, 1996, Phase 2 reformulated gasoline has been available
in Southern California and, by June, 1996, all gasoline fueled vehicles will
be operating on the new reformulated gasoline.  The Phase 2 gasoline contains
2% oxygen, with lower amounts of sulfur, olefins, and aromatics, which should
result in significantly lower amounts of CO, VOC, and possibly lower carcinogen
emissions.  Both the AQMD and CARB currently are conducting projects on
reformulated gasoline where the specific composition of liquid and gas phases
are analyzed and compared with the old gasoline.  However, the scope of these
projects only outlines the differences in fuel composition and does not evaluate
the impact of Phase 2 reformulated gasoline on actual emission changes from
the operating fleet.
<P>The proposed follow-up study to be conducted during the summer of 1996
at the Sepulveda and/or Van Nuys locations will quantify the emissions generated
by the local fleet operating on Phase 2 reformulated gasoline.  The relatively
short time that has elapsed between this proposed study and the previous
study conducted in 1995 should facilitate separating the effect of fleet
turnover from the effect of the new gasoline on emissions.  This will improve
the basis for comparison of emissions trends and quantification of benefits
solely due to gasoline reformulation.
<P><B>Proposal</B>
<P>Traffic through both the Sepulveda and Van Nuys tunnels provides an excellent
representation of the Southern California fleet.  The tunnels offer adequately
long driving paths, relatively constant speed, and heavy traffic.  Based
on the run-to-run variability of the results obtained at each tunnel during
the 1995 study, a decision will be made to either measure emissions at the
inlet and outlet of both tunnels equal to the previous study, or conduct
the measurements at the Sepulveda tunnel only, with an increased number of
samples to improve reliability of the results.  Sampling periods will be
chosen to represent different driving patterns, fleet mixes, and ambient
temperatures.  Samples will be collected and analyzed for PM<SUB>10</SUB>,
PM<SUB>2.5</SUB>, NO<SUB>x</SUB>, CO, CO<SUB>2</SUB>, non-methane hydrocarbons
(nmhc), and aldehydes.  Vehicles will be characterized with traffic measurements
including counts, vehicle types and age distributions.  Vehicle license numbers
will be obtained by video-taping vehicles traveling through the tunnel. 
Air flow, temperature, and relative humidity also will be measured.
<P>Data from field measurements will be transferred to a common database,
validated, and then used to calculate on-road emission factors.  Analysis
will be conducted to separate the effects of fleet turnover from the effects
of reformulated gasoline.  Emission factors will be compared with model EMFAC7G,
and the results of the 1995 study, to evaluate the effects of Phase 2
reformulated gasoline.
<P>This proposed project is included in the Technology Advancement Plan for
the Clean Fuels Program TR-01, "Advanced Transportation Systems Research,
Development and Demonstration."  The expected benefits of this project include
the evaluation of on-road emission changes due to the introduction of Phase
2 reformulated gasoline.
<P><B>Sole Source Justification</B>
<P>Section II, Step 3(C) of the Consultant Selection Policy identifies four
provisions under which the Governing Board may award a sole-source bid: (1)
cost to prepare documents exceeds the cost for consultants, (2) delay would
result in the endangerment of public health, (3) services are only available
from sole-source, (4) other circumstances exist identifying sole-source as
in the best interest of the AQMD.  This request for sole sole-source award
is being made under provision (4).
<P>CRC is the pre-eminent leader in the United States in the area of conducting
mobile source emission studies. During the past six years, it has conducted
the on-road vehicle emissions workshop in San Diego, and presented numerous
papers in this field.  It was the leading group in conducting the Southern
California Air Quality Study in 1987, which included the Van Nuys tunnel,
and the nationwide tunnel study in 1995, which included the Sepulveda and
Van Nuys tunnels.  AQMD played a major role in both studies.  The 1995 study
evaluated vehicle emissions contributed from the fleet operating on transitional
gasoline and compared the results with the 1987 findings.  It also established
the basis for the upcoming study to evaluate the impact of Phase 2 reformulated
gasoline on emissions from vehicles.
<P>CRC intends to secure the services of the University and Community College
System of Nevada (UCCSN) for this study.  UCCSN, a subcontractor to CRC,
is an expert in mobile emissions testing and will be responsible for emission
measurements and development of profiles for use in ambient receptor monitoring.
 The UCCSN team will be led by Dr. Alan Gertler, who is an expert in the
area of atmospheric chemistry and has authored several papers in this field.
 He has been investigating discrepancies between observed and predicted
automotive emission factors.  He also led the UCCSN team in conducting the
previous CRC 1995 tunnel study that included the Sepulveda and Van Nuys tunnels.
<P>The proposed follow-up study will utilize the methodologies and procedures
established during the 1995 nationwide study that was also conducted by CRC
with the services of UCCSN.  The experience gained from the 1995 study,
specifically at the Sepulveda and Van Nuys locations will help in conducting
the proposed study in a cost effective manner. Furthermore, CRC is participating
in this study by contributing $25,000.
<P>UCCSN encourages the participation of, and uses as subcontractors, small
businesses, and minority-, disabled veteran-, and woman-owned business
enterprises in its programs to the maximum extent possible to ensure efficient
performance and comply with contract requirements and applicable laws.
<P><B>Resource Impacts</B>
<P>The total cost of the project is $275,000, with AQMD's contribution amount
not to exceed $250,000.  CRC intends to provide the $25,000 balance of funding
for this project.  Sufficient funds are available in the Fiscal Year 1995-96
to fund this project.

<P><HR>
<P><B>Background</B>
<P>The AQMP, as part of an emission control strategy for airlines and airports,
calls for airport GSE to operate on alternative fuels, including electricity.
 The ARB has statutory authority to control the emissions of airport GSE,
but there are no plans to promulgate emission-control regulations for this
equipment at this time.  To promote the development of zero-emission, electrified
GSE, the AQMD issued RFP  #9596-10, "Airport Ground Support Equipment (GSE)
Electrification."  This RFP was approved by the Governing Board on October
13, 1995, and issued on October 20, 1995.  Responding proposals were due
January 11, 1996.  The distribution of the RFP is summarized in Attachment
1.
<P>UAL, in partnership with the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power,
submitted the only proposal received in response to this RFP.  This proposal
was reviewed by an evaluation panel that included staff from the ARB, CEC
and AQMD, and was found to meet the minimum requirements of the RFP.  The
panel and its evaluation are summarized in the following attachments:  Attachment
2, demographics of the evaluation panel; Attachment 3, summary of proposal
scoring, and Attachment 4, sample scoring sheet.
<P><B>Proposal</B>
<P>UAL proposes to develop two types of GSE.  First, an electric conversion
of a diesel push-out tractor for wide-body aircraft.  This will involve designing
a retrofit electric drive system and battery pack, converting a UAL push-out
tractor, testing the converted tractor, and demonstrating the tractor in
aircraft service at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX).  The demonstration
period for the electric tractor in actual service will be about 13 months.
 Second, an inductive-couple charging system for electric baggage tow tractors.
 Such a system will not require electric tractor operators to manually plug-in
for recharging, but simply to park the equipment in a specified area.  This
phase will involve re-designing an existing inductive-couple charging system
to increase charging efficiency and to meet Federal Aviation Agency standards
to protect communication and navigation equipment from electrical interference.
 This re-designed equipment will then be fabricated and installed in three
parking areas for electric baggage tow tractors at LAX.  The demonstration
period for the inductive charging equipment in actual service will be about
16 months.
<P>This proposed project is included in the Technology Advancement Plan for
Clean Fuels Program as Project MS-01, "Airport Ground Support Equipment
Electrification."  The expected benefits of this project are direct emission
reductions during the demonstration period.  The emissions reductions for
both the electric push-out tractor for wide-body aircraft and the three baggage
tow tractors will be approximately 1.5 tons/year of VOC, CO, NO<SUB>x</SUB>
and particulate matter.  Should all related equipment at UAL's LAX facility
be converted to electric power, this emission reduction benefit could increase
to about 29 tons/year.  If successfully demonstrated, the resulting zero-emission
technology will become commercially available for various uses in Southern
California with commensurate emission benefits.
<P>This project involves the significant participation of a Woman Business
Enterprise (WBE) and a Minority-owned Business Enterprise (MBE).  Flintridge
Consulting of Pasadena, a certified WBE, will provide the monitoring, reporting
and regulatory liaison for this project.  ISE Research of San Diego, a certified
MBE will provide the design and expertise for converting the diesel pull-out
tractor to an electric drive system.
<P><B>Resource Impacts</B>
<P>The total estimated cost of this development and demonstration project
is approximately $759,363.  The cost to the AQMD will not exceed $379,463.

<P><B>AGENDA NO.8</B></P>
<P><B>PROPOSAL:</B></P>
<P> Execute a Contract to Cost-Share the Development and Demonstration of an Electric Vehicle Range Extender</P>
<P><B>SYNOPSIS:</B></P>
<P> The first electric vehicles to be offered for sale will have lower-than-desired travel range due to battery limitations.  AC Propulsion of San Dimas has proposed to develop and demonstrate an EV range extender that will enable EVs to be used for long trips.  The availability of such units should enhance the marketability of EVs and increase their number in the vehicle fleet.  The cost of this program is $675,000 of which the AQMD would cost-share in an amount not to exceed $296,000.</P>
<P><B>COMMITTEE:</B></P>
<P> Technology, April 10, 1996, Recommended for Approval</P>
<P><B>RECOMMENDED ACTION:</B></P>
<P>Authorize the Chairman to execute a contract with AC Propulsion to develop and demonstrate an electric vehicle range extender for an amount not to exceed $296,000.</P>
<P> James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<BR> Executive Officer</P>
<P>CSL:ARA:MXB</P>
<P><B>Background</B></P>
<P>The AQMP calls for the accelerated introduction of zero-emission electric vehicles (EVs) as an air quality attainment strategy.  ARB regulations require the major automotive manufacturers to offer EVs for sale in California in 2003.  Although there is no production requirement for years 1998-2002, ARB has established a Technology Partnership intended to place as many as 3,750 advanced EVs on California roads in the interim.  As a result, General Motors will introduce limited production of its EV1 in 1996.  Several other manufacturers also are planning to introduce EVs over the next few years.  Although vehicle and battery technology is developing rapidly, these initial EVs will have some range and recharging-time limitations compared with conventional vehicles.  These EVs will be quite adequate for short trips up to 90 miles, but will have no utility for extended trips.  For the longer term, either advanced long-range batteries or fuel cells will be required for EVs to broadly penetrate the vehicle fleet.</P>
<P>The range limitations of these early generation EVs have spawned the development of EV range extenders by two companies, AC Propulsion and Fisher Electric Motor Technology.  Current range extender designs consist of gasoline-engine-driven generator sets mounted on torque trailers which provide essentially unlimited electrical energy and range for EVs.  However, tongue trailers are difficult to back up and do not have emission controls on their internal combustion engines.</P>
<P>User-friendly, low-emission range extenders have the potential to improve EV marketability by addressing the energy limitations associated with current-technology batteries.  Consumers will be more likely to purchase EVs knowing that they can be driven on cross-country trips using range extenders that could be rented from EV dealerships or equipment rental businesses.  Range extenders can also be designed to achieve very low, ULEV-equivalent emissions.</P>
<P><B>Proposal</B></P>
<P>AC Propulsion proposes to develop a lightweight, high-power, user-friendly, low-emission range extender based upon experience gained with two successive range extender designs.  Their proposed design will use a space-frame trailer with a close, rigid bumper mount to the EV.  A motorcycle engine, using either gasoline or propane, will power a high-efficiency, lightweight alternator.  Emissions will be controlled to very low levels through the use of a three-way catalytic converter and electronic engine control.  The development and demonstration of the range extender will include: the design of the alternator and charging subsystem; development of the engine and emission controls; design of the trailer chassis, enclosure and noise control; subsystem integration; and testing of the range extender.</P>
<P>This proposed project is included in the Technology Advancement Plan for Clean Fuels Program as Project MS-13, &#147;Development and Demonstration of Advanced EV Technologies.&#148;  In terms of direct emission reductions, an EV using the range extender will be at least as clean as an ULEV during periods when the range extender is operating.  When the range extender is not operating, during all-electric use of the EV, emissions will be zero.  On a per-mile basis, power plant emissions attributable to EV use are about 100 times lower than ULEV emissions, as estimated by the ARB.  Thus, while an EV using the range extender will not offer the full emissions benefits of a pure-electric EV, the overall operating emissions will be significantly lower than a ULEV.  Moreover, range-extender operation and the associated emissions, will probably occur mostly out of the Basin when it is needed for long trips.  </P>
<P>Availability of the range extender can help expedite EV deployment in the Basin.  Consumers will be more likely to purchase EVs knowing that they will have the option to rent an range extender and drive the EV on vacations and long trips.  Such EVs will replace conventional vehicles with much higher emissions.  Although there are no emission benefits during the brief demonstration period of this project, the goal is to develop technology which will encourage the acceptance and purchase of EVs.  If successfully demonstrated, the resulting range extender technology will become commercially available for use in Southern California with commensurate emission benefits through the greater use of EVs.</P>
<P><B>Sole Source Justification</B></P>
<P>Section II, Step 3(C) of the Consultant Selection Policy and Procedure, identifies four provisions under which the Executive Officer may award a sole-source bid: (1) cost to prepare documents exceeds cost for consultant; (2) delay would result in the endangerment of public health; (3) services are only available from sole-source; and (4) other circumstances exist identifying sole-source as in the best interests of the AQMD.  This request for sole-source bid is made under provision (4).</P>
<P>In September 1995, the AQMD issued Program Opportunity Notice (PON) #9596-001.  The objective of this PON was to solicit interest in and identify potential proponents for a cost-shared program to develop and demonstrate a user-friendly, low-emission range extender.  This solicitation encouraged the use of various types of engines including small gas turbines or motorcycle engines, high-power lightweight alternators, advanced emission controls, and alternative fuels such as propane.</P>
<P>The PON was sent to 403 different businesses around the world, of which 107 were located in California.  Three pre-proposals were received in response to the PON:  AC Propulsion of San Dimas, Alturdyne of San Diego, and Virginia Polytechnic Institute.  One pre-proposal was expensive, and the other two involved the use of tongue trailers and heavy systems.  Each proposer was requested to revise its proposal to better meet the scope of the intended project.  AC Propulsion and Alturdyne revised and resubmitted their pre-proposals; Virginia Polytechnic did not resubmit.</P>
<P>The redesigned Alturdyne range extender did not use a tongue trailer and was much reduced in weight.  However, this redesigned unit did not contain a fuel tank, would require a special lift for installing the range extender into the rear bumper of an EV, and would likely cause vehicle handling problems.  Thus, this proposal was deemed technically unacceptable.</P>
<P>AC Propulsion revised its proposal to develop a bumper-mounted, dual-caster-wheel tubular space frame trailer with suspension and a retractable third wheel for off-vehicle maneuvering and parking.</P>
<P>Staff believes the proposal submitted by AC Propulsion represents a viable approach to development of a consumer-acceptable EV range extender.  AC Propulsion, a small business located in San Dimas, California, has extensive experience in developing high-power, high-efficiency EVs, EV drivetrains, and EV battery recharging and monitoring systems.  The company has developed two generations of range extenders, and has practical experience with two cross-continent trips and over 15,000 miles of travel with a range extender.</P>
<P><B>Resource Impacts</B></P>
<P>Total estimated cost of the development and demonstration project is approximately $675,000; cost to the AQMD will not exceed $296,000.  The funding breakdown is as follows:</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Synopsis:</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The California Electric Transportation Coalition (Cal ETC) has
proposed
to supply the AQMD with technical information regarding the development and
implementation of EV infrastructure standards.  These include state building
codes, emergency-response standards, and charging hardware standards.  These
all relate to the upcoming introduction of EVs in the Basin by the major
automotive manufacturers.  The total cost for this contract is $90,000; the
AQMD cost-share will not exceed $30,000.

<BR> Executive Officer
<P><FONT SIZE=-1>CSL:ARA:MXB</FONT>
<P><HR>
<P><B>Background</B>
<P>The AQMP calls for the accelerated introduction of zero-emission EVs as
an air-quality attainment strategy.  ARB regulations governing new-vehicle
manufacturers require the production and sale of EVs in California.  These
regulations will result in the production and sales of General Motors' EV1
beginning this year.  Other manufacturers are also planning to introduce
EVs over the next few years.
<P>EVs are much different than conventional vehicles, and the infrastructure
to recharge, maintain, provide emergency service, garage and support such
vehicles is new.  In cooperation with the automotive manufacturers, various
technical committees in California and the nation are developing standards
to support the introduction of EVs.  As various local, state and federal
incentives are now available to encourage the early introduction and purchase
of EVs, there is a critical need to quickly develop and disseminate EV
infrastructure requirements.  Expanding the available infrastructure will
make EVs more marketable, thereby enhancing their penetration into the
transportation mix.
<P><B>Proposal</B>
<P>Cal ETC has proposed to supply the AQMD with an ongoing status of developing
EV-infrastructure standards, their impacted institutions, and final copies
of these standards when they are adopted. Cal ETC will accomplish this by
providing information on, but not limited to, the following EV issues: building
codes, recharging hardware and standards, recharging power quality requirements,
emergency-response standards, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, and
National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration decisions.  In partnership
with various utilities and communities, the AQMD can then disseminate and
promote the implementation of these EV standards.
<P>This proposed project is included in the Technology Advancement Plan for
Clean Fuels Program as Project TT-01, "Assessment of Advanced Technologies
and Information Dissemination."  The are no expected emission benefits of
this project during its duration.  The project goal is to obtain information
for dissemination and establishment of EV infrastructure.  If successful,
EVs will be able to proliferate in Southern California with commensurate
emission benefits.
<P><B>Sole Source Justification</B>
<P>Section II, Step 3(C) of the Consultant Selection Policy and Procedure,
identifies four provisions under which the Executive Officer may award a
sole-source bid: (1) cost to prepare documents exceeds cost for consultant;
(2) delay would result in the endangerment of public health; (3) services
are only available from sole-source; and (4) other circumstances exist
identifying sole-source as in the best interests of the AQMD.  This request
for sole-source award is made under provision (4).  A sole-source contract
with the Cal ETC is in the best interest of the AQMD.
<P>Cal ETC, a nonprofit tax exempt corporation, was established in 1991 to
promote the development and commercialization of electric transportation
in California.  Its members include utilities, EV component manufacturers,
and advanced battery developers, and is associated on the national level
with the Electric Transportation Coalition.  Cal ETC acts as an advocate
and resource for its members to advance EV market development and education,
vehicle technology research, building code development and charging standard
development.  Its members are active in the development of electric
transportation-related legislation.  Cal ETC participates in Society of
Automotive Engineers (SAE) technical standards committees to further the
development of EV infrastructure.  It works with state agencies such as ARB
and the California Energy Commission, and local governments to ensure
coordination of efforts to develop EV commercialization.
<P>Cal ETC is uniquely situated to obtain information related to EV
infrastructure standards.  Because of its associations with utilities, EV
component and battery manufacturers, technical organizations, and federal,
state and local government agencies, Cal ETC has access to a breadth of
EV-related information needed to efficiently and effectively design and promote
EV infrastructure development in the Basin.
<P>Cal ETC encourages the participation of minority-owned, women-owned, and
disabled veteran-owned business enterprises in their programs to the maximum
extent possible to ensure efficient performance and to comply with contract
requirements and applicable laws.  Although no requirements for subcontracted
efforts have been identified at this time, qualified subcontractors will
be sought as needed.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Execute a Contract to Cost-Share Development and
Demonstration of Phase-2 Electric US Postal Service Long-Life Vehicles
</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Synopsis:</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The US Postal Service (USPS) is developing electric
conversions for its fleet of gasoline-powered Long-Life Vehicles (LLVs).
 A Phase-1 demonstration of two electric LLVs was successfully completed.
 TransMotive Technologies, in partnership with the USPS, now has proposed
the development and demonstration of a Phase-2 electric LLV conversion. 
Following development, ten LLVs will be converted with five to be demonstrated
in mail delivery service in Huntington Beach.  The total cost of this project
is $1,325,556; AQMD's cost-share will not exceed $150,000.

<BR> Executive Officer
<P><FONT SIZE=-1>CSL:ARA:MXB</FONT>
<P><HR>
<P><B>Background</B>
<P>The AQMP emphasizes the use of battery- and fuel-cell-powered ZEVs as
an air quality attainment strategy.  Although the ARB is requiring the
introduction of ZEVs by the manufacturers of light-duty vehicles, no such
requirement exists for medium-duty vehicles such as USPS LLVs.  Such commercial
vehicles normally have range requirements that exceed the capability of current
EV propulsion and battery technologies.
<P>The USPS operates the largest vehicle fleet in the world with 204,000
vehicles.  Seventy-five percent of this fleet consists of LLVs which are
generally used for stop-and-go mail delivery.  Typically, they are used for
short daily routes and, thus, are good candidates for electric propulsion.
 LLVs have a design life of 24 years, with a major engine and drivetrain
overhaul planned after 12 years.  Federal mandates require fleet operators
to purchase ZEVs beginning in 1998.  The USPS is investigating replacement
of LLV drivetrains with battery-powered electric propulsion at the major
overhaul point as a method to generate ZEV credits for the mandates.
<P>US Electricar recently concluded a Phase-1 Proof-of-Concept project for
converting LLVs to electric propulsion.  A conversion system was developed,
and two electric LLVs (ELLVs) were successfully demonstrated in Torrance,
California and Merrifield, Virginia.  The success of this project prompted
the USPS to initiate a Phase-2 ELLV Demonstration Program to develop and
demonstrate the next-generation conversion prior to the fleetwide deployment
of ELLVs in 1999 (Phase 3).  Under Phase 2, 25 ELLVs will be demonstrated
in five U.S. cities, spanning a diverse range of topography and climate.
 Two of these cities are located in California, one within the South Coast
District (Huntington Beach and San Francisco) and shall be supported by this
contract.  The goals of Phase 2 are to design and demonstrate various ELLV
designs, demonstrate their maturity, collect performance data, establish
life-cycle costs, and demonstrate the safety of ELLVs.
<P><B>Proposal</B>
<P>In partnership with US Electricar, Southern California Edison, Pacific
Gas and Electric, and others, TransMotive Technologies proposes to design,
build and demonstrate ten ELLVs in the two California cities.  These
second-generation ELLVs will be based upon the information derived from the
Phase-1 design and demonstration.  TransMotive proposes to complete their
Phase 2 ELLV project through the following steps:
<P> (1)  Design System Configuration
<BR>(2)  Determine Structural Integrity, Durability and Crashworthiness
<BR> (3)  Build 10 ELLVs
<BR> (4)  Install Charging Infrastructure at Two Demonstration Sites
<BR> (5)  Demonstrate ELLVs in USPS Service
<P>Five ELLVs will be equipped with GNB-brand EV batteries and will be
demonstrated at the Huntington Beach, California, Postal Center.  The other
five ELLVs will be equipped with Electrosource Horizon EV batteries and will
be demonstrated at the San Francisco, California, Postal Center.  ELLVS will
be demonstrated in mail service for a period of approximately 15 months.
<P>This proposed project is included in the Technology Advancement Plan for
Clean Fuels Program as Project MS-13, "Development and Demonstration of Advanced
Electric Vehicle Technologies."  The potential emission benefits of ELLVs
are largely due to their stop-and-go duty cycle.  There are approximately
7500 LLVs in the South Coast Air Basin.  If one-third of these are converted
to ELLVs, their emissions will be reduced by an estimated 250 tons/year of
VOC, CO and NO<SUB>x</SUB> .  If successfully demonstrated, the resulting
ZEV technology will become commercially available for the conversion of LLVs
and other vehicles throughout Southern California with commensurate emission
benefits.
<P><B>Sole Source Justification</B>
<P>Section II, Step 3(C) of the Consultant Selection Policy and Procedure,
identifies four provisions under which the Executive Officer may award a
sole-source bid: (1) cost to prepare documents exceeds cost for consultant;
(2) delay would result in the endangerment of public health; (3) services
are only available from sole-source; and (4) other circumstances exist
identifying sole-source as in the best interests of the AQMD.  This request
for sole-source award is made under provision (4).  It is in the best interest
of the AQMD to award a sole-source contract to TransMotive Technologies.
<P>First, TransMotive Technologies is one of four firms selected by the USPS
to participate in Phase 2.  Each firm will be demonstrating five ELLVs in
a particular city; however, TransMotive will be demonstrating 10 vehicles,
five each in the Los Angeles and San Francisco areas.  Ultimately, these
four firms are competing for the USPS contract for the Phase-3 fleetwide
conversions of LLVs.  It is in the AQMD's best interest to support the
demonstration of ELLVs in the Basin.
<P>TransMotive has assembled a highly qualified team to execute this project:
<P>(1) TransMotive has extensive experience in vehicle system design.  They
have developed various computer tools to integrate state-of-the-art components,
materials, and technologies into electric and hybrid-electric vehicles. 
They are the developers of DYAD3D and other sophisticated models to evaluate
structural integrity, durability and crashworthiness.  TransMotive will lead
the system configuration design and structural/crashworthiness tasks;
<P>(2) US Electricar will be the prime subcontractor and will serve as the
program manager and manufacturer for the Phase-2 project.  US Electricar
has extensive experience in manufacturing EVs and has developed the electric
S-10 pick-up truck, the electric Prizm sedan, the first-generation ELLV,
a 22-foot electric bus, and a hybrid-electric delivery van;
<BR>
<P>(3) USPS will supply the LLVs for conversion and will host the ELLV
demonstration in the Basin at the Huntington Beach Postal Center;
<BR>
<P>(4) Delco Electronics Power Control Systems will supply engineering support
for the charging system;
<BR>
<P>(5) Southern California Edison will supply the engineering support for
the recharging station at the Huntington Beach site; and
<BR>
<P>(6) GNB Battery Company will supply the EV batteries for the ELLVs in
the SCAB.
<P>TransMotive, US Electricar, the USPS and Southern California Edison encourage
the participation of minority-owned, women-owned, and disabled-veteran-owned
business enterprises in their programs to the maximum extent possible to
ensure efficient performance and to comply with contract requirements and
applicable laws.  Although no requirements for subcontracted efforts have
been identified at this time, qualified subcontractors will be sought as
needed.
<P><B>Resource Impacts</B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Award Contracts for Air Quality Investment Program
</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Synopsis:</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>On March 8, 1996, the Board approved in concept the staff
recommendations
to award contracts for the AQIP.  At that time staff was directed to return
to the Board for final approval.  Staff recommends that the Board approve
the release of AQIP funds for the final quarter funding of 1995.

<BLOCKQUOTE>1. Authorize the Chairman to execute a contract in an amount
not to exceed
$49,308, from the Air Quality Investment Program Special Revenue Fund, with
Lapis Energy (Chino and Desert Sand Unified School Districts) for purchase
of three years of equivalent emission reductions and to exercise the 120-day
agreement of the previously approved contract with Eco-Scrap in an amount
not to exceed $352,495.
<P>2. Direct the Executive Officer to deem in compliance all employers
participating in the AQIP between July 1, 1995 and December 7, 1995 for an
additional two years.

<P><HR><B>Background</B>
<P>On March 8, 1996, the Board approved in concept staff's AQIP funding
recommendations for the final quarter of 1995 which were to fund the Lapis
Energy (Chino and Desert Sand Unified School Districts) proposal to convert
diesel-powered school buses to CNG-powered buses and to exercise the 120-day
option with Eco-Scrap to purchase the remaining second and third year emission
reduction credits.  The Board did not authorize executing these two
recommendations due to pending legislation that would prohibit AQMD from
continuing with the AQIP and require AQMD to return a portion of the funds
collected under the AQIP.  Staff was directed to return to the Board, prior
to the expiration of the 120-day option, no later than May 18, 1996, for
final approval.
<P><B>Proposal Evaluation</B>
<P>Staff recommends that the Board approve the release of funding for the
Lapis Energy (Chino and Desert Sand Unified School Districts) proposal for
$49,308 and exercise the 120-day option with Eco-Scrap for $352,495.  For
the final quarter of 1995, the total funding amount that staff recommends
the Board approve is $401,803.  Any remaining AQIP funds would be held for
future proposal funding in subsequent quarters.  All employers participating
in the AQIP between July 1, 1995 and December 7, 1995 would be deemed in
compliance for an additional two years.
<P>The resulting emission reductions will meet the total required equivalent
emission reductions for all Rule 1501.1 - Alternatives to Work Trip Reduction
Plans affected worksites participating in the third and fourth quarters of
1995 for a full three-year period at a similar cost to Rule 2202.  In other
words, employers who have paid $110 per employee from July 1, 1995 through
December 7, 1995 under Rule 1501.1 would receive credit for three years of
compliance instead of one.  This action would help level the playing field
because once Rule 2202 was adopted on December 8, 1995 employers paid $125
for each peak window employee for a triennial compliance option.  Any carryover
monies from the previous quarters will be combined with the next quarter's
funding for the next round of proposals to be considered.
<P>Execution of these funding recommendations will complete the AQIP funding
pursuant to rescinded Rule 1501.1 and will allow the Board to proceed with
AQIP funding under Rule 2202.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Award Sole Source Contract to County of Los Angeles for
Communications
Site License Support
</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>SYNOPSIS:</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>AQMD's radio communication system supports the broadcast of air
quality
information and provides real time communication between headquarters and
field inspection staff.  A previous sole source contract with the County
of Los Angeles to lease standard radio rack and antenna space(s) for radio
communications purposes only at multi-user communication sites has expired.
 The proposed sole source contract continues this previous Communication
Site License rental agreement with the County of Los Angeles through February
28, 2001 for an amount not to exceed $96,300.
</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>COMMITTEE:</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Administrative, April 19, 1996, Recommended for Approval
</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>RECOMMENDED ACTION</B>:
<BLOCKQUOTE>Authorize the Chairman to execute a contract with County of Los
Angeles
for Communications Support Services at the annual rate of $19,260 for a total
 amount not to exceed $96,300 for five years.
</BLOCKQUOTE><P> James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<BR> Executive Officer
<BR>PL:ELP:CSA:DC
<P><B>Background</B>
<P>For the past twelve years, AQMD's radio communication system has supported
the broadcast of daily air quality forecasts, health advisories, and alerts
to schools, industries, media and other episode receivers located in the
South Coast Air Basin, provided real time communication between headquarters
and field inspection staff, and facilitated emergency incident response
communication.  AQMD first contracted with the County of Los Angeles for
a Communications Site License to lease radio rack and antenna space(s) during
Fiscal Year 1984-85.  The most recent contract for these services was initiated
in January 1990 with a term of five years.  During 1995, this contract was
extended until new contract terms could be agreed upon by AQMD and County
of Los Angeles.  The sole purpose of the proposed rental agreement is to
allow the exclusive use of standard radio rack and antenna space(s) for AQMD
radio communication purposes only at the following multi-user communication
sites owned, operated and maintained by County of Los Angeles:
<P><BR> (1)  Eastern Avenue Microwave Communication Site, Los Angeles;
<BR>(2)  Hauser Peak Communication Site, Acton;
<BR> (3)  County Courthouse, Pasadena; and
<BR> (4)  Rolling Hills Transmitter Site, Rolling Hills.
<P>The term of this license is five (5) years commencing March 1, 1996 and
ending February 28, 2001 at a total cost not to exceed $96,300.  Negotiating
this contract annually would be more costly; negotiating for a five-year
term enables the AQMD to secure reduced communication rental site rates.
 AQMD reserves the right to cancel this License or cease operation on one
or more sites upon giving thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the County
of Los Angeles.
<P><B>Sole Source Justification</B>
<P>Section II, Step C(3) of the Consultant Selection Policy and Procedure
identifies four provisions under which a sole-source bid may be justified:
(1) cost to prepare documents exceeds cost for consultant, (2) delay would
result in the endangerment of public health, (3) services are only available
from sole-source, (4) other circumstances exist identifying sole-source as
in the best interests of the AQMD.  This request for sole-source bid is made
under provision (3).  The County of Los Angeles is the only provider of this
type of service.  AQMD's radio communication capability depends on utilizing
the County of Los Angeles facilities.
<P><B>Resource Impacts</B>
<P>Sufficient funds are available in the FY 1995-96 budget and it is expected
that future budgets will contain sufficient resources as well.

</BLOCKQUOTE><P>James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<BR>Executive Officer
<P><FONT SIZE=-1>BRW:VCM:JCM:RL</FONT>
<P><HR><B>Background</B>
<P>The AQMD unveiled its World Wide Web Home Page on July 1, 1995.  The Web
site has enabled the public and the regulated community to access and download
information (rules, reports, workshop notices, Board actions, etc.) previously
available only on paper.  Electronic posting of these materials provides
quicker, more comprehensive access to AQMD information and reduces the need
to handle paper (printing, storing, mailing, etc.).  With the development
and implementation of a pilot system that enables facilities to file permit
applications over the Internet, the functionality of the AQMD Home Page is
expanding to include more interactive communication and data gathering. 
The goal of this expansion is to improve AQMD's efficiency and responsiveness
to businesses and is another element of the regulatory reform initiatives
adopted by the Governing Board.  The pilot system for electronic permit
application filing is just an initial step in more fully exploiting the
communication potential of the Internet and AQMD's Web site.
<P><B>Proposal</B>
<P>To enable more interactive electronic communications between AQMD and
the public/regulated community, the current Web server hardware must be upgraded.
 The AQMD's World Wide Web site was initiated using computer hardware already
on hand.  Subsequently, the utility and effectiveness of communicating with
the public and the regulated community through the Internet has been
demonstrated.  The current server hardware is not adequate, however, for
an expansion into more interactive communications or the data capture and
storage requirements expected with on-line forms and data gathering such
as electronic permit application filing.  A local database will be needed
for data storage and querying by outside entities to maintain full security
for the mission-critical data in the AQMD's Central Information Repository.
 A new Internet server that will enable AQMD to implement the pilot system
for electronic permit application filing and expand into other electronic
forms must be purchased.
<P>Enhancing and expanding interactive communications and information gathering
on the AQMD's Web site also will require purchase of additional Ingres database
user licenses to allow multiple external users to enter data or access stored
information concurrently.  Without additional licenses, external users could
be denied access or experience delays, potentially leading to frustration
with on-line systems such as electronic permit application filing.  Sufficient
licenses for both the pilot permit application filing system and for future
expansion into other areas is appropriate at this time as the price of user
licenses will increase by 50% after June 30, 1996.
<P>The cost for an upgraded Internet server is $50,000 and for sufficient
additional Ingres database user licenses the cost is $24,500.  Funding for
these purchases is available from the FY1995-96 Budget.  $50,000 identified
as "VOC Central Station Hardware and Software" in the FY1995-96 Budget Fixed
Asset Account can be reallocated to "Upgrade AQMD's World Wide Web Server."
 To purchase sufficient Ingres database user licenses, $24,500 can be transferred
from the FY1995-96 Budget Fixed Asset Major Object for Information Management
(two account items identified as "Aviion 550 Workstation" and "Network Management
Computer") to the Services &amp; Supplies Major Object, Professional &amp;
Special Services Account, for Information Management.  The needs for which
these two redesignated budget items were intended will be fulfilled by using
the existing Internet server hardware configuration in place of purchasing
a new network management computer and the current network management computer
will be used in place of purchasing a new Aviion 550 Workstation.

SYNOPSIS: <BR>
<blockquote>It is the Board's policy for staff to periodically bring to the
Board all necessary budget transfers occurring during the Fiscal
Year. Budget transfers are the result of Board actions, further
definition of programs approved in the budget, reorganizations,
reallocations of budgeted funds, or budget corrections. These
transfers move funds to the appropriate accounts and do not require
additional appropriations.</blockquote><BR>

<P>
<B>Background</B>
<P>
In December 1995 the AQMD participated in the issuance of Pension
Obligation Refunding Bonds to refinance the unfunded accrued actuarial
liability for retirement benefits. The retirement benefits expenditure
savings in FY 1995-96 will be used to make the first installment
payment for the bonds. A transfer of a portion of each office/division's
Retirement Benefits account to the District General Interest Expense
account is required.<BR>

<P>
Since our last Board-approved FY 1995-96 budget transfer, two
additional Governing Board member assistants have been identified
as contract AQMD employees. Funds budgeted for their services
need to be moved from the Professional and Special Services account
to the Salary account.<BR>

<P>
Funds were included in the FY 1995-96 fixed asset budget to replace
ten digital data loggers. The cost of each digital data logger
no longer qualifies the item as a fixed asset. Funds need to be
transferred from Fixed Assets to the Laboratory Supplies account
in the Services and Supplies Major Object.<BR>

<P>
Funds were included in the FY 1995-96 overtime account for staff
to scan all new Governing Board and Hearing Board documents and
all previous documents of both boards back to 1991. Because of
staff workload it is necessary to have the work performed by temporary
agency services. Funds need to be transferred from the Salary
and Benefits Major Object Overtime account to the Temporary Agency
Services account in the Services and Supplies Major Object.<BR>

<H3>Proposed 1996-97 Budget Cuts $5 Million</H3>
<P>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="ad96v3n5.gif" ALT="Budget Cuts" ALIGN="BOTTOM">
<P>

<FONT SIZE=2><I>&quot;...cleaner air, and less need to regulate businesses...<BR>
means less revenue for the District,&quot; says Executive Officer <BR>
James Lents.  The above graph depicts the gradual decline of AQMD's <BR>
budget over the years.</I></FONT></CENTER>
<P>
AQMD's budget for fiscal year 1996-97 would decline by $5 million
under a proposal expected to be approved by the Governing Board
on May 10.
<P>
Program costs would be cut from $100.8 million in the current
fiscal year to $95.8 million, or by 4.9%.
<P>
Revenues would decline $4.2 million from $97.1 million to $92.9
million, or by 4.3%.  The difference between expenditures and
projected revenues would be made up by spending down AQMD's reserves.
<P>
&quot;This year's budget continues AQMD's commitment to cut its
size in half over the next ten years,&quot; said Executive Officer
James M. Lents.  &quot;Our budget is down more than 15% since
its peak in 1992 and our authorized staffing is down by 34%.&quot;
<P>
Salaries and benefits will be cut by $4.1 million, from $60.3
million to $56.2 million, or 6.8%.  This cut will be achieved
by reducing authorized staff positions from 796 to 764 and no
cost-of-living increase.  In fiscal 1991-92, there were 1,163
authorized positions.
<P>
Expenditures on services and supplies will be cut by $1.4 million,
or 3.5%.
<P>
<B>Fee Income Down</B>
<P>
While individual fees would be raised 1.2%, consistent with the
rise in the state consumer price index over the last year, total
revenue from fees on businesses for  emissions, permit renewals
and transportation would decline from $50.6 million to $46.3 million,
or by 4.3%.
<P>
&quot;We're seeing the results of declining emissions, which means
cleaner air, and less of a need to regulate businesses due to
cleaner technologies coming on line,&quot; Lents said.  &quot;It
also means less revenue for the District.&quot;
<P>
With continued progress toward clean air, revenue from emission
fees paid by businesses based on the amount of air pollution they
emit has decreased from $40.5 million in 1990-91 to next year's
projected total of $20.8 million.
<P>
Permit fees for new businesses would increase from $8.2 million
to $8.9 million, or by 8.5%, due to growing business activity
in the region, Lents noted.
<P>
The lion's share of remaining AQMD revenue comes from $22.8 million
in registration fees for motor vehicles, the number one source
of air pollution, Lents said.
<P>
AQMD also will receive $6.2 million in grants and subventions
from the federal and state governments and $6.7 million in miscellaneous
fees, such as rents and subscriptions to AQMD publications.
<P>
<I>- Bill Kelly</I>
<P><BR>
<A NAME="fund"></A>
<H4>Board Backs Clean-up Fund Trust</H4>
<P>
In a major shift in air pollution clean-up policy, the Board has
endorsed establishing a public trust fund to help clean up remaining
sources of air pollution.
<P>
The trust fund would be a key element of &quot;The Clean Air Credit
Exchange&quot; concept, given a green light by the Board in March.
<P>
Under the proposal, businesses would be able to pay into a fund
used for clean-up projects in lieu of reducing their own emissions.
<P>
AQMD then would use the money to pay for clean-up projects, such
as converting vehicles and equipment to cleaner fuels that would
reduce pollution.
<P>
&quot;As the region continues to seek economically sound ways
to clean the air, this system will keep us on the fastest, most
flexible and efficient path to that goal,&quot; said James M.
Lents, executive officer.
<P>
&quot;It will foster economic growth while achieving clean air.&quot;
<P>
AQMD staff will develop specific rules defining the Clean Air
Credit Exchange which the Governing Board will consider adopting
late this year.
<P>
Under the Exchange, businesses would have three options for meeting
smog control requirements:  1) reduce their own pollution; 2)
buy credits from sources of pollution that reduce emissions beyond
required levels; or 3) pay into the clean-up fund.
<P>
The trading market would enable businesses to develop credits
through such diverse options as scrapping dirty old cars and lawn
mowers, converting equipment and vehicles to clean fuels or selling
clean consumer products.
<P>
Possible sources of pollution credits would encompass more than
30,000 businesses; 10 million motor vehicles; ships, trains and
planes; and a vast array of consumer products used by the region's
14 million people.
<P>
&quot;The scope of this credit market should provide a positive
boost to development of clean air products,&quot; said Lents.
 &quot;We should see an even faster pace toward healthful air
over the next five years.&quot;
<P>
To ensure continued progress toward clean air, AQMD will continue
to develop regulations to reduce pollution from specific industries.
<P>
These sources then will have the choice of reducing emissions
as specified in the rules, purchasing emission credits from those
who have exceeded their requirements or paying into the clean
air fund to fulfill their obligation.  Combinations of these approaches
would also be allowed.

<H3><A NAME="legislative"> LEGISLATIVE UPDATE</A></H3>
<P>
<H4>State Lawmakers Focus on Air Quality Legislation</H4>
<P>
The 1996 legislative session promises to be a busy one for AQMD.
 The agency is monitoring over 100 air quality-related bills that
have been introduced this session.  About a dozen directly affect
AQMD and its operations.  
<P>
However, by the time this issue of the
<I>AQMD Advisor</I> is published, some bills may have progressed
through the legislative process while others might not. 
<P>
Several significant bills affect AQMD, its budget, Governing Board
structure and Rule 2202.  Tax incentives for pollution control
equipment, amendments to the California Clean Air Act, environmental
self-auditing and carpool lane use are among the topics of proposed
legislation. 
<P>
Here is a list of some of the more significant bills affecting
AQMD:
<UL>
     <B>SB 836 (Lewis):</B>  Introduced in 1995; was amended to
repeal Rule 2202 and require funds paid into Air Quality Investment
Program to be refunded. <B>AQMD's position</B>: <I> Oppose</I>
<P>
     <B>SB 1518 (Hurtt):  </B>Requires all AQMD funds to be transferred
to the state General Fund starting in July 1997. <B> AQMD's position</B>:
 <I>Oppose</I>
<P>
     <B>SB 1601 (Lewis):  </B>Freezes AQMD budget at FY 1996-97
level; requires statutory authorization for new or adjusted fees.
 <B>AQMD's position</B>: <I> Oppose</I>
<P>
     <B>SB 1602 (Lewis):  </B>Restructures the AQMD Governing Board,
decreases membership from 12 to 9 members, eliminates cities representatives.
 <B>AQMD's position</B>:  <I>Oppose</I>
<P>
     <B>SB 1603 (Lewis):  </B>Prohibits AQMD and other agencies,
including cities in its jurisdiction, from regulating indirect
sources.  <B>AQMD's position</B>:  <I>Oppose</I>
<P>
     <B>SB 2080 (Hurtt):  </B>Would allow counties to opt out of South
Coast AQMD upon resolution of their respective Boards of Supervisors;
requires withdrawing counties to comply with all requirements
in the latest federally-approved State Implementation Plan.  <B>AQMD's
position</B>:  <I>Oppose</I><B> </B>
<P>
     <B>SB 2130 (Hurtt):  </B>Would prohibit AQMD from regulating
schools, community colleges or county education offices in any
way.  In addition to exempting schools from Rule 2202, also exempts
them from permitting rules and air toxics reporting requirements.
<B> AQMD's position</B>: <I> Oppose</I>

<H3><A NAME="rule_changes"> RULE CHANGES </H3>
<P>
<H4>Rule 2202 Changes Benefit Schools</H4>
<P>
At its March meeting the Governing Board voted 8 to 0 to allow
public and private primary and secondary schools to earn extra
credit toward the air pollution control agency's rule to reduce
on-road vehicle emissions.
<P>
The extra credit amendment to Rule 2202 is for schools that meet
their emission reduction targets through student busing programs
or are experiencing financial hardships. To meet that target the
district must transport two students for every one school district
employee who reports to work at a regulated site between 6 a.m.
and 10 a.m.  
<P>
The change could save public school districts as much as $4.3
million a year.
<P>
 Rule 2202 is a more flexible and less costly alternative to reduce
on-road mobile source emissions than AQMD's old rideshare rule
1501. 
<P>
Last December the Board directed staff to determine the economic
impacts of Rule 2202 on Southland schools and to analyze approaches
for offering the educational sites relief  from the new rule.

<P>
&quot;The changes to Rule 2202 offer area schools greater flexibility
in meeting their emission reduction goals and an opportunity to
lessen the financial burdens they now face,&quot; said AQMD Chairman
Jon D. Mikels, a San Bernardino County supervisor. 
<P>
In the South Coast Air Basin, primary and secondary public schools
make up 376 of the 4,900 work sites affected by Rule 2202. Trips
generated by these schools emit 1.38 tons of pollution per day.
<P>
The Board also directed staff to study ways of providing schools
with credit for students who walk, bike, take public transit or
carpool to school.

<H3><A NAME="ca_partnership"> CLEAN AIR PARTNERSHIP </H3>
<P>
<H4>Amnesty Causes Permit Applications to Skyrocket</H4>
<P>
AQMD has hailed its 6-month Amnesty Program - a one-time effort
to help businesses obtain permits, which ended April 2 -  a success.
<P>
The program allowed businesses to voluntarily file an application
for unpermitted equipment without subjecting them to a 15% late
fee and risk of penalty. Most of the permit applications were
for chlorofluorocarbon recycling units used by auto air conditioning
mechanics and internal combustion engines, such as emergency power
generators in office buildings.
<P>
&quot;Amnesty was successful because of the unprecedented outreach
program we conducted within the local business community and the
help of business networks,&quot; said AQMD Public Advisor LaRonda
Bowen.
<P>
To promote the program, AQMD employed newspaper and radio ads
and mailed 100,000 notices to business owners from 60 different
industries.  AQMD engineers, technicians and small business experts
supported the outreach effort with over-the-phone and on-site
compliance assistance.
<P>
The agency also worked with area Chamber of Commerce presidents,
trade associations, environmental consultants and certified permitting
professionals in the four-county area to spread the word about
amnesty.
<P>
The publicity blitz generated 2,873 phone calls and confirmed
that more than 1,000 callers needed permits. AQMD staff also conducted
136 no-fault inspections throughout the region.<B> </B>
<P>
&quot;We visited facilities from Chatsworth to Colton, walked
factory floors and helped fill out forms,&quot; Bowen said. 
<P>
      AQMD's Governing Board approved the rule in October 1995
to help level the playing field and ensure that companies that
comply with air quality standards do not face unfair competition
from those who do not.

Priority Permitting Pilot Rolls Out the &quot;Green Carpet&quot;
for Companies</A></H4>
<P>
The AQMD Board has launched a pilot program that offers priority
permitting services to Southland companies making a significant
effort to create jobs and reduce air pollution.
<P>
The &quot;Green Carpet&quot; Priority Permitting Service was developed
through a cooperative effort between the South Coast Air Quality
Management District and the California Council for Environmental
and Economic Balance.  It offers special assistance to firms looking
to expand and create jobs, or install or develop advanced air
pollution control technologies.  
<P>
The &quot;Green Carpet&quot; service is part of AQMD's Regulatory
Reform Initiative, introduced in January to eliminate permits
for small sources and streamline the process for larger facilities.
 The 12-month pilot program started April 12.
<P>
&quot;'Green Carpet' represents a mutual commitment between AQMD
and companies that have demonstrated their commitment for cleaning
the air and maintaining a healthy economy in our region,&quot;
said AQMD Chairman Jon D. Mikels, a San Bernardino supervisor.
<P>
To be eligible for the &quot;Green Carpet&quot; service companies
must meet one of the following criteria:
<UL>
     <B>&quot;Three Star&quot; Project</B> - Construction of a
new facility or modification of an existing one to meet or exceed
air emission standards set for the year 2010.
<P>
     <B>HELP Project -</B> Construction of a new High Employment,
Low Pollution facility or modification of an existing one to expand
business or create more than 500 jobs, and produce half the emissions
per employee allowed under the year 2010 goal for its industry.
<P>
     <B>Major Capital Project - </B>Implementation of a standard,
single-phased design project that costs more than $10 million.
Both engineering and construction time must exceed one year each.
<P>

<P>
AQMD is co-sponsoring a project to demonstrate wet cleaning, a
commercial cleaning process that uses water instead of chemicals
to clean everything from wool sweaters to silk blouses.
<P>
&quot;Almost all dry cleaners now use perchloroethylene, or 'perc,'
a potentially toxic cleaning agent that pollutes the air and can
contaminate groundwater,&quot; said Executive Officer James M.
Lents.
<P>
&quot;Wet cleaning offers the promise of cutting air pollution,
reducing consumers' personal exposure to potentially toxic chemicals
and even saving money for commercial cleaners.&quot;

<P>
Researchers at the Pollution Prevention Education and Research
Center at the University of California, Los Angeles, will spend
the next year collecting data at a Santa Monica wet cleaning business
to compare the efficacy, costs and labor of wet cleaning to perc-based
dry cleaning.
<P>
Wet cleaning machines cost less than dry cleaning equipment and
can be cheaper to operate because they do not require the purchase
of perchloroethylene, the expense of air pollution controls and
hazardous waste disposal fees for discarded perc.

<P>
<H4>Wood Cabinet Maker's Commitment Shows Waterborne Coatings are
a Successful Alternative</H4>
<P>
In response to industry concerns voiced during the September 1995
meeting, the Governing Board delayed the final volatile organic
compound limits of the agency's wood product coating rule (Rule
1136) until July 1,1996.  
<P>
Soon after, a working group, consisting of AQMD staff and industry
representatives, formed to resolve the concerns.  Some Southland
companies have successfully converted their facilities to use
low VOC coatings. Southcoast Cabinet Inc. of Walnut is one of
them.
<P>
Two years ago Danny Senese, president of Southcoast Cabinet, made
a commitment to use only waterborne coatings to produce his company's
high-quality wood cabinets used in Southern California homes.
 His operation uses a combination of a gas-fired oven and infrared
lights to cure the water-based stains, sealers, and topcoats applied.
<P>
<P>
&quot;We are able to produce a much better finish than with nitrocellulose
solvent based coatings,&quot; said Senese.
<P>
According to Assistant Deputy Executive Officer Jack Broadbent,
who visited the cabinet company early this year, many facilities
throughout the South Coast Air Basin are using low VOC and waterborne
coatings on a regular basis.
<P>
 &quot;Danny Senese is an excellent example of an individual's
personal commitment to improving our air quality,&quot; said Broadbent.

<P>
&quot;His company is one of many in the region for which waterborne
coatings are a viable way of reducing VOC emissions while creating
a superior product.&quot;
<P>
AQMD's Board will consider the most recent proposed amendments
to Rule 1136 on June 14.
<P>
<I>For more information on Rule 1136 and the use of low-VOC and
waterborne coatings call AQMD Compliance Supervisor Marty Kay
at (909) 396-3115.</I>

<H4>Moo-ving Study Clears the Air On Cow Emissions</H4>
<P>
The Southland's 300,000 dairy cattle cause significantly less
particulate-producing ammonia pollution than previously thought,
according to a recently completed AQMD study.
<P>

<P>

The $130,000 project was funded by the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency and AQMD in cooperation with Chino-area dairymen and the
Ontario-based Milk Producers Council.
<P>
Study results, combined with the migration of dairy farms out
of the region, may result in less need for future air pollution
controls at dairies.
<P>
Dairies' effect on air quality, and the possible need for future
pollution controls, will be assessed in AQMD's 1997 Air Quality
Management Plan now under development.
<P>
&quot;Dairies are a significant source of ammonia emissions, which
help form particulate pollution,&quot; said Executive Officer
James M. Lents.  &quot;They also can create a notable odor nuisance
prompting citizens complaints to AQMD and other agencies.
<P>
&quot;Land use conflicts have caused some dairies to move to other
areas.  If this trend continues, we may need only simple air pollution
controls at dairies or perhaps no control measures at all.&quot;
<P>
Ammonia emissions from livestock waste, along with manmade pollutants,
contribute to particulate pollution, which has been linked to
275 premature deaths a year in the Inland Empire.  Particulate
emissions also caused smog clouds that block views of nearby mountains.
<P>

AQMD researchers studied ammonia emissions at four Chino-area
dairies during fall and winter of 1995.  The new study found that
per-cow emissions are only one-fourth to one-third of those reported
by a 1987 study, which used less sophisticated methods for estimating
emission rates.

<A NAME="new_fuel">
<H4>New Cleaner-Burning Fuel Will Help Drive Away Smog</H4>
<P>
By June 1, California motorists will be pumping the nation's cleanest
gas into their tanks.
<P>
According to the California Air Resources Board, which sets the
specifications for the new fuel, the cleaner gasoline burns more
completely, reduces smog-forming emissions and lessens human cancer
risk from exposure to toxics in gasoline by 30% to 40%.
<P>
Use of the new fuel will reduce the state's smog-forming emissions
by 300 tons per day; carbon monoxide emissions will drop by 1,300
tons per day, and sulfur dioxide by 30 tons per day. 
<P>
&quot;The daily emission reductions are equivalent to removing
3.5 million cars from the state's roads and highways,&quot; said
ARB Chairman John Dunlap. 
<P>
For the Southland the reduction is equal to removing 1.5 million
cars from the road.
<P>
&quot;ARB's clean-burning gas may drop air pollution levels in
the basin by as much as 15%,&quot; said AQMD Executive Officer
James M. Lents. 
<P>
Mobile sources such as our basin's 9 million motor vehicles are
major contributors to the region's smog.  Lents said it is essential
for cars to do their fair share of the clean up and not shift
more of the burden on our industries. 
<P>
The new gasoline contains oxygenates that allow it to burn more
efficiently.  Its level of the cancer-causing compound benzene
is 50% less than in conventional fuels. The new fuel also contains
lower levels of sulfur and other high-polluting compounds.
<P>
ARB said the cleaner gas doubles the clean air benefits of the
federally-approved reformulated gas sold in Southern California
since 1995.
<P>
Cleaner-burning gas also is safe for off-road vehicles (such as
boats, snowmobiles) and gas-powered lawn and garden equipment.

<A NAME="health_study">
<H4>Health Effects Study Focuses on the Toxicity of Road Dust</H4>
<P>
Air quality officials have launched a study to measure the amount
of asthma-causing allergens in the air from vehicle tire dust.
<P>
A recent health effects study in Denver suggests that latex in
road dust produced as vehicle tires wear is probably responsible
for an increase in asthma attacks and asthma-related deaths in
the United States during the last decade.  Road dust, including
tiny bits of tire wear, can account for up to 50% of particulate
pollution in urban areas, AQMD scientists said.
<P>
AQMD's Governing Board approved $50,000 toward the study, which
will be conducted by the California Institute of Technology in
Pasadena.  The California Air Resources Board will contribute
an additional $104,000 toward the research.
<P>
The study will ultimately help quantify the health benefits of
reducing road dust pollution.
<P>
Researchers will collect samples of ambient air and road dust
from Long Beach, Los Angeles and Rubidoux during a six-month period.
 They will quantify latex allergen in road dust and ambient particulate
pollution and estimate the amount of road dust in ambient particulate
pollution.
<P>
Although the study will not be completed before the adoption of
the 1997 Air Quality Management Plan, results should help guide
future control efforts to attain federal standards for particulate
pollution, air quality officials said.

<H3><A NAME="reclaim"> RECLAIM </A></H3>
<P>
<H4>The White House Recognizes RECLAIM</H4>
<P>
The President's Council on Sustainable Development has recognized
AQMD for its innovative emissions trading program, known as RECLAIM.
<P>
AQMD was honored with a certificate of appreciation for its REgional
CLean Air Incentives Market program, which provides businesses
with greater flexibility and cost savings in reducing nitrogen
oxide and sulfur oxide emissions, two key ingredients of the area's
air pollution.
<P>
RECLAIM was one of more than 300 entries considered for the 1996
Presidential Awards for Sustainable Development.  The council
recognized AQMD for its &quot;commitment and work on behalf of
sustainable development in America.&quot;
<P>
RECLAIM was adopted in 1993 to lower the cost of reducing pollution
in the South Coast Air Basin.
<P>
Under RECLAIM, companies that have reduced emissions more than
required can sell their excess emission reduction credits to companies
exceeding their limits.  This allows businesses flexibility in
how to reduce emissions, yet assures that overall emissions decline
each year to meet air quality improvement goals.
<P>
&quot;RECLAIM is a critical tool in achieving our region's clean
air objectives with the support of our business community,&quot;
said James M. Lents, executive officer.
<P>
Since taking effect in 1994, the 350 facilities covered by RECLAIM
have traded more than 100,000 tons of emission reduction credits
for more than $10 million.
<P>
A recent audit shows that the companies are on track toward meeting
the program's requirements to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions
by 77 tons a day and sulfur oxide emissions by 15 tons a day by
2003.
<P>
The audit also showed that 86% of the facilities fully complied
with their initial emission reduction targets.
<P>
RECLAIM is the first part of a broader AQMD strategy to foster
greater use of market incentives and flexible clean air strategies
in the Southland.

<H4>Nation's First Commuter Bike Station Opens in Long Beach</H4>
<P>
Bike enthusiasts pedaled to Long Beach this spring to celebrate
the opening of the first commuter bike station in the country.
 
<P>
Modeled after stations in Europe and Japan, the Bike Station provides
covered, guarded bicycle parking for 150 bikes at a $1-a-day reduced
rate for commuters, along with rentals and repairs, a rest area,
changing rooms and refreshments.
<P>
It is located at First Street and the Promenade, just blocks away
from Long Beach's five-mile coastal bike path.  The Bike Station
links the West Coast's busiest port city to a Transit Mall serving
the Metro Blue Line to downtown Los Angeles and local bus transit
facilities, including Orange County Transit and Long Beach Transit,
as well as the Runabout, a downtown commuter shuttle.  
<P>
The Bike Station was the brainchild of  John Case, an avid cyclist,
who noticed neighbors chaining their bikes to lampposts and street
signs or - even worse - driving just a few blocks to the Metro
Blue Line station before commuting to jobs in Los Angeles.  
<P>
According to Tim Lee, project manager with the City of Long Beach,
commuter bike stations provide more livable communities through
better air quality, reduced traffic congestion and by offering
convenient commuting alternatives to city residents.

<P>Proposed rule will take a two-step approach to gather data on flaring
operations at petroleum refineries to assess the need for, or the level of,
any future controls required in order to reduce flare emissions.  The first
step will require refineries to monitor flaring activities for the amount
and composition of gases being flared.  If the data demonstrates a need to
control flaring operations, step two of the rule will be to develop specific
control requirements to reduce flare emissions.

<P><B>Background</B>
<P><U>EIR and Document Log (Attachments A and B)</U> - Each month, the AQMD
receives numerous CEQA documents from other public agencies on projects which
could adversely affect air quality.  Listings of all documents received for
review are contained in Attachments A and B.  Monthly listings which are
shaded note those CEQA documents for which the AQMD  has prepared and submitted
comments to the lead agency, or will do so.  A list of active projects from
previous months for which AQMD is continuing to evaluate or prepare comments
is included as Attachment B.  A column has been added to the tables in
Attachments A and B of this report in response to Board member request. 
The column captioned "Public Concerns" identifies parties who have contacted
the AQMD with concerns or issues about the proposed project.  A notation
of 1 in this column indicates the contact was supportive of the project noted.
 A notation of 2 indicates the party was opposed or expressed concerns about
the project.  A notation of 3 indicates that no one contacted the AQMD about
that project.
<P>In the past, AQMD staff routinely reviewed many of these documents and
commented upon the air quality analyses and possible impacts on the air quality
of the district.  Due to staffing constraints, the AQMD is no longer able
to routinely comment on all CEQA documents received.  Publication of the
Board-approved <I>CEQA Air</I> <I>Quality Handbook</I>, however, has provided
local governments and other public agencies with the necessary information
to prepare appropriate air quality analyses on projects for which they act
as lead agency.  As resources permit, staff evaluates and may prepare comments
for projects that may have significant adverse regional air quality impacts
(e.g., special event centers, landfills, etc.) and those projects for which
a lead or responsible agency has specifically requested AQMD review.
<P><U>AQMD Lead Agency Projects (Attachment C)</U> - Pursuant to CEQA, the
AQMD periodically acts as lead agency on stationary source permit projects.
 Under CEQA the lead agency is responsible for determining whether an
Environmental Impact Report (EIR) or a Negative Declaration is necessary
for any proposal considered to be a "project" as defined by CEQA.  An EIR
is prepared when the AQMD as lead agency finds substantial evidence that
the proposed project may have a significant adverse effect on the environment.
 A Negative Declaration may be prepared if the AQMD determines that the proposed
project will not generate significant adverse environmental impacts.  The
Negative Declaration is a written statement describing the reasons a proposed
project will not have a significant adverse effect on the environment and,
therefore, does not require the preparation of an EIR.
<P>Attachment C to this report summarizes the active projects for which the
AQMD is lead agency and is currently preparing or has prepared environmental
documentation.  As noted in Attachment C, during March 1996, the AQMD continued
working on CEQA documents for three (3) active projects.
<P>To date in 1996, the AQMD, as lead agency, prepared or contracted for
the preparation of and certified one (1) CEQA document.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Rule 2005 - New Source Review for RECLAIM, Subdivision (j), requires
the Executive Officer to report to the Governing Board by May of each year,
on the effectiveness of RECLAIM NSR in meeting the federal NSR requirements
for the preceding year.  This report details AQMD's success in meeting federal
NSR requirements for 1995.

<BR>  Executive Officer
<P><FONT SIZE=-1>PL:CC:PM:BLY:PYP:scs</FONT>
<P><HR>
<P><B>Background</B>
<P>The federal  NSR program, Title 42, U.S.C. Section 7511a(e), requires
major stationary sources in extreme non-attainment areas to mitigate their
emissions increases by providing emissions offsets at a 1.5:1 or 1.2:1 ratio
when the offsets are obtained from external sources, or a 1.3:1 ratio when
the offsets are generated internally.  In order to provide RECLAIM facilities
with maximum flexibility, as well as to simplify the RECLAIM Trading Credit
(RTC) transaction system, Rule 2005 establishes a NSR offset ratio of 1:1
for RECLAIM pollutants.  AQMD Rule 2005 establishes pre-construction review
requirements for construction of new RECLAIM facilities and for modifications
to existing RECLAIM facilities in order to ensure continued progress toward
attainment of National Ambient Air Quality Standards without restricting
economic growth.  Rule 2005, subdivision (j) requires the Executive Officer
to annually report to the Governing Board on the effectiveness of RECLAIM
NSR in meeting federal NSR requirements for the preceding year.  This report
summarizes RECLAIM's overall programmatic achievement of the federal NSR
requirements.  Because of the annual reduction to each facility mass cap
in RECLAIM, the fundamental purpose of NSR is met in that new or modified
source emission growth does not negatively affect Reasonable Further Progress
goals.
<P>By this report, AQMD demonstrates that RECLAIM generates sufficient excess
emission reductions beyond the Clean Air Act requirements, such as reasonably
available control technology (RACT), to mitigate the difference between the
Rule 2005 offset ratio and the higher offset ratio in federal law.
<P><B>NSR Compliance Demonstration</B>
<P>During 1995, five tons of NOx RTCs from external sources were provided
to offset emissions increases due to operation of a new RECLAIM facility
pursuant to Rule 2005(b)(2).  In addition, 388 tons of NOx RTCs and 42 tons
of SOx RTCs from RECLAIM facilities' allocations were held to offset increases
in emissions due to modifications to 114 existing RECLAIM facilities pursuant
to Rule 2005(c)(2).
<P>Staff has determined that in 1995 the programmatic emission reductions
exceeded the increases in NOx and SOx emissions due to NSR activities (i.e.,
new or modified existing sources) by the ratio of 8.4:1 and 12.6:1, respectively.
 Table I shows NSR activity related to RECLAIM NOx and SOx sources in 1995.

<P>The total of 3,299 tons of programmatic NOx RTC reductions were 8.4 times
greater than the 1:1 offset ratio already provided for in Rule 2005 for emissions
increases from NSR activity, far exceeding federal NSR offset requirements
of 1.2:1.  Similarly, the total of 530 tons of programmatic SOx RTC reductions
were 12.6 times greater than the SOx emissions increases.
<P>Above and beyond the programmatic RECLAIM reductions, staff has also
determined that in 1995 the allocated, but unused RTCs could also be used
as emission offsets against NOx and SOx emissions increases due to NSR
activities.  The resulting offset ratio is 35.2:1 and 75.4:1 for NOx and
SOx, respectively.  Table II shows the actual RTC activity related to RECLAIM
NOx and SOx sources in 1995.

federal NSR offset requirements.  Similarly, the total 3,128 tons of unused
SOx RTCs were 75.4 times greater than the SOx emissions increases.
<P>The total programmatic annual NOx and SOx reductions, and the unused NOx
and SOx RTCs constitute creditable emission reductions since they are real,
quantifiable, enforceable, and surplus of Clean Air Act required or RACT
emission reductions.  Therefore, both the programmatic RTC reductions and
the unused RTCs can be used to offset emissions increases due to new or modified
existing sources, and the total offset ratios shown in Tables III demonstrate
that the RECLAIM program exceeds the federal NSR requirements of 1.2:1 and
1.3:1 for external and internal offsets.

<P>This analysis indicates that RECLAIM generates sufficient creditable emission
reductions, and supplies adequate RTCs to offset NOx and SOx emissions increases
due to NSR activities during 1995.  Further, RECLAIM provided offsets for
all NOx and SOx emissions increases at offset ratios of 43.6:1 and 88:1,
respectively.  These offsets provided by RECLAIM exceed the federal NSR
requirements of 1.2:1 and 1.3:1 for external and internal offsets.  Therefore
we conclude that RECLAIM is in compliance with federal NSR requirements in
1995.<p>

<br>
   Mee Hae Lee
<br>
   Chair, Stationary Source Committee
<hr>
<P>
<B>Attendance</B>
<P>
Present were Committee Chair Mee Hae Lee and Committee
Members Nell Soto and Ron Loveridge.  In the absence of Committee
Members Marvin Braude and James Silva, Board Chairman Jon Mikels
appointed himself an ad hoc member of the Stationary Source Committee
for the meeting April 19, 1996 only.  Also present, but not voting,
was Leonard Paulitz.

<P>
<B>Summary</B>
<P>
The Committee reviewed the items on their agenda
(copy attached).  Comments were noted on the following items:


<P>
<B>1. Cool Community Concept</B>
<P>
 Guest speaker Dr. Art Rosenfeld gave a presentation
focusing on what communities can do to lessen utility costs and,
thus, smog effects by various means.  He reported that the color
of concrete, roofs, etc. (using more white and pastel colors)
cools the community and controls the smog.  The Committee thanked
Dr. Rosenfeld and expressed interest in his study.<BR>

<P>
<B>2. Regulation III - Fees</B>
<P>
 Mee Lee asked staff to prepare a response to statements
made by Speaker of the Assembly Curt Pringle in his April 17 press
release in the <U>Orange County Register</U>.  In the article,
Pringle states that he has ordered a legislative committee to
conduct a thorough review of the budget of the South Coast Air
Quality Management District.<BR>

<P>
<B>3. Proposed Modification to Rule 1145 - Plastic,
Rubber, and Glass Coatings</B>
<P>
 The Committee suggested that staff describe the
expected VOC reductions and cost effectiveness.  They also questioned
why this item was being brought up at this time, as the emissions
were rather low.  It was agreed that staff would take a look at
the order in which VOC rules should go to the Board.  After hearing
the Board's concerns, staff indicated a second public workshop
would be held prior to the July Board meeting.<BR>

<P>
<B>4. Area Source Credits</B>
<P>
 The Committee asked staff to incorporate the flexibility
for accommodating innovative ideas, such as those presented by
Dr. Rosenfeld (item 1 above).<BR>

<P>
<B>5. Rule 1136 - Wood Products Coatings</B>
<P>
 The Committee was pleased with the progress on the
rule.  They reviewed the revised industry proposal which will
achieve 50 percent of the scheduled emission reductions.  In addition,
they discussed the amount of time (6 months or a year) appropriate
for this next stage of reductions.  Committee Member Loveridge
commented that the District exceeded any other organization he
was aware of in the time and effort expended on rule development.
 He felt staff should publicize this work and note the process
of iteration that each rule goes through.<BR>

<P>
<B>6. Rule 1113 - Architectural Coatings</B>
<P>
 Staff presented a 2-step proposal for rule development,
with certain revisions to be considered in August, and others
to follow next year.<BR>

<P>Committee Topics
<P><B>1.</B><B> </B><B>Execute a Contract to Cost-Share a Follow-Up Tunnel
Study to Evaluate the Impact </B><B>of Reformulated Phase 2 Gasoline on Emissions
from Vehicles</B>
<P> The Coordinating Research Council (CRC), with AQMD's cofunding, conducted
a nationwide tunnel study in 1995 that included the Sepulveda and Van Nuys
tunnels.  The proposed contract with CRC will be a follow-up study at either
or both of the Sepulveda and Van Nuys tunnels after the introduction of Phase
2 reformulated gasoline.  The results will be compared to the 1995 study
to evaluate the actual on-road impact of Phase 2 gasoline on vehicle emissions.
 <I>The Committee reviewed </I><I>the information presented and recommended
approval of staff's recommendation.</I>
<P><B>2.</B><B> </B><B>Execute a Contract to Cost-Share the Incorporation

<P><B>3.</B><B> </B><B>Execute a Contract to Cost-Share the Development and
Demonstration of Phase-2 </B><B>Electric US Postal Service Long-Life Vehicles
(LLVs)</B>
<P> The US Postal Service (USPS) is developing electric conversions for its
fleet of gasoline-powered Long-Life Vehicles (LLVs).  A Phase-1 demonstration
of two electric LLVs was successfully completed.  TransMotive Technologies,
in partnership with the USPS, now has proposed the development and demonstration
of a Phase-2 electric LLV conversion.  Following development, ten LLVs will
be converted with five to be demonstrated in mail delivery service in Huntington
Beach.  <I>The Committee reviewed the information presented and recommended
approval of </I><I>staff's recommendation.</I>
<P><B>4.</B><B> </B><B>Execute a Contract to Cost-Share the Development and
Demonstration of an Electric </B><B>Vehicle Range Extender</B>
<P> The first electric vehicles to be offered for sale will have
lower-than-desired travel range due to battery limitations.  AC Propulsion
of San Dimas has proposed to develop and demonstrate an EV range extender
that will enable EVs to be used for long trips.  The availability of such
units should enhance the marketability of EVs and increase their number in
the vehicle fleet.  <I>The Committee reviewed the information
</I><I>presented and recommended approval of staff's recommendation.</I>
<P><B>5.</B><B> </B><B>Execute a Contract to Cost-Share the Development and
Demonstration of Electric </B><B>Airport Ground Support Equipment (GSE)</B>
<P> The AQMP, as part of an emission control strategy for airlines and airports,
calls for airport ground support equipment (GSE) to operate on alternative
fuels, including electricity.  In response to the RFP, AQMD received only
one bid, from United Airlines (UAL), to develop an electric push-out tractor
for wide-body aircraft and an inductive charging system for electric baggage
tractors.  <I>Committee members </I><I>indicated the need to address the
issue of electromagnetic force (EMF) associated </I><I>with EVs.  TA staff
indicated they plan to bring to the Committee a Board Letter on </I><I>EMF
and health-related issues pertaining to EVs and EV charging infrastructure.
 The </I><I>Committee reviewed the information presented and recommended
approval of staff's </I><I>recommendation.</I>
<P><B>6.</B><B> </B><B>Execute a Cost-Shared Contract to Provide Technical
Information Relating to EV </B><B>Infrastructure</B>
<P> The California Electric Transportation Coalition (Cal ETC) has proposed
to supply the AQMD with technical information regarding the development and
implementation of EV infrastructure standards.  These include state building
codes, emergency-response standards, and charging hardware standards.  These
all relate to the upcoming introduction of EVs in the Basin by the major
automotive manufacturers.  <I>The Committee reviewed the information presented
and </I><I>recommended approval of staff's recommendation.</I>
<P><B>7.</B><B> </B><B>Execute a Contract to Cost-Share the Development of
a Prototype Economical </B><B>Advanced Electric Vehicle and a Plan for California
Production</B>
<P> The ARB has identified several impediments to development and production
of EVs by the major vehicle manufacturers, including low-volume production,
uncertain market and undeveloped electric drivetrain and battery technologies.
 The proposed contract with ARB will result in a viable EV design and an
analysis of the processes and costs of developing and manufacturing low
production volumes of advanced EVs in California.  <I>The Committee reviewed
the information presented and noted their </I><I>tentative approval pending
further discussions with the ARB on the details of the </I><I>proposed program,
and contingent upon review by Administrative Committee.  </I><I>Moved by
Jon Mikels, seconded by Leonard Paulitz, to refer this item to
</I><I>Administrative Committee.</I>
<P>Other Business - There was no other business.
<P>Public Comment Period - There was no public comment.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Investment Oversight Committee Appointment
</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>SYNOPSIS:</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Board action on April 12, 1996, approved a recommendation to
minimize
AQMD investments in the Los Angeles County Pooled Surplus Investment Portfolio
(PSIP), by directing staff to work with the Los Angeles County Treasurer
(AQMD's Treasurer) to make specific investments on behalf of the AQMD.  This
recommended action included the establishment of an Investment Oversight
Committee, a Board advisory committee, to monitor AQMD's investments.
</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>COMMITTEE:</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Administrative, April 19, 1996, Recommended for Approval
</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>RECOMMENDED ACTION:</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>1. Approve the following responsibilities of the Investment Oversight
Committee:
<BR>
<UL><LI>Monitor compliance with the AQMD's specific purpose investment
policy.
<LI>Review the quarterly report of investments to the Governing Board.
<LI>Recommend for Board consideration modifications to the annually
adopted statement of investment policy.
</UL><P>2. Authorize the Chairman to appoint the Investment Oversight Committee
which shall consist of six members:  three Governing Board members, of which
one shall be Chair of the Investment Oversight Committee; two individuals
with local government agency investment responsibilities; and one individual

<P><HR>
<P><B>Background</B>
<P>Based on an extensive review of the AQMD treasury management operations
and the risks and benefits associated with investing in a commingled county
investment pool, the AQMD Governing Board, at its April 12, 1996 meeting,
directed staff to work with the County to reallocate a significant portion
of its short-term investments from the County's commingled Pooled Surplus
Investment Portfolio (PSIP)  into its non-commingled Special Purpose Investment
Portfolio (SPI) and into the Local Agency Investment Fund (LAIF) managed
by the State Treasurer.  To implement and monitor this change in investment
policy, the Board approved the establishment of an Investment Oversight
Committee.
<P><B>Proposal</B>
<P>The Investment Oversight Committee is an advisory committee to the Board,
established for the purpose of overseeing the development and periodic update
of an AQMD Investment Policy and Guidelines document; the monitoring of
compliance with Los Angeles County and AQMD investment guidelines; and the
review of the quarterly investment reports to the AQMD Governing Board. 
The Investment Oversight Committee will be staffed by the Director of Finance,
with compliance and investment analysis provided by an independent advisor
specializing in municipal investment services.
<P><B>Resource Impact</B>
<P>Sufficient funding is available in the Draft FY 1996-97 Budget.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Requirements (New Source

of visibility for Federal Class I areas into Regulations XIII and XX.  Protection
of visibility for Federal Class I areas and notification of Federal Land
Managers are requirements of federal law.
</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Committee:</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Not applicable
</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Recommended Action:</B>
<P> 1. Amend Rule 1303 - Requirements and Rule 2005 - New Source Review for
RECLAIM, and
<P> 2. Certify the CEQA Notice of Exemption for the proposed amendments in
accordance with the attached resolution.
<P>  James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<BR>  Executive Officer
<P><FONT SIZE=-1>PL:AG: RAR</FONT>
<P><HR>
<P><B>Background</B>
<P>The AQMD Governing Board amended Regulation XIII - New Source Review on
December 7, 1995.  At that time, the Governing Board deferred some issues
including Federal Class I areas protection of visibility and notification
to Federal Land Managers (FLMs), which are requirements of federal law and
are designed to protect visibility in pristine areas, such as national parks
and national forests.  There are six Federal Class I areas in the AQMD, namely:
 Agua Tibia, Cucamonga, Joshua Tree, San Gabriel, San Gorgonio and San Jacinto.
 Attachment A contains a map showing the locations of these six areas.  The
United States Forest Service and the National Park Service are the two FLMs
that supervise these six Federal Class I areas in the AQMD.
<P>The objective of the protection of visibility and FLM notification
requirements is to ensure that the construction of a new major source or
modification of an existing major source does not adversely impact the visibility
of Federal Class I areas.  Such visibility impacts may be caused by the formation
of a visible plume or regional haze.  The proposal maintains the air quality
objectives of Regulation XIII - New Source Review (NSR) and Regulation XX
- Regional Clean Air Incentives Market (RECLAIM) while facilitating the ability
to new and modified existing sources to comply with the NSR requirements.
 The overall emission reduction potential of Regulation XIII - New Source
Review (NSR)and Regulation XX - Regional Clean Air Incentives Market (RECLAIM)
are not expected to change as a result of these proposed amendments.
<P>The staff proposal to amend Rule 1303 - Requirements and Rule 2005 - New
Source Review for RECLAIM, will help make the AQMD's NSR program and RECLAIM
approvable by EPA for inclusion in the SIP, without unnecessary administrative
burden to facilities or government agencies involved.  Subsequent amendments
to NSR regulations will address the other items that were deferred from the
December 7, 1995 Board meeting.
<P><B>Proposal</B>
<P>Protection of visibility and FLM notification requirements are related
to the definitions of "major polluting facility" and "major modification."
 The AQMD has extremely low thresholds for these definitions because federal
and state law have designated the AQMD Basin as being an extreme nonattainment
area of air quality standards.  If these thresholds were used to require
new and modified sources to protection of visibility and FLM notification
requirements, thousands of permits each year could potentially be affected.
 The administrative burden would overwhelm the regulated community, the AQMD,
and the FLMs, with potentially little benefit.  The AQMD has worked with
the federal EPA, Forest Service, National Park Service, and industry in an
attempt to reduce the regulatory and administrative burden of these requirements
without compromising the CAA goals for protection of visibility in Federal
Class I areas.  This work has led to the development of applicability criteria
for these requirements based on extensive modeling and other CAA requirements.
<P>The staff proposal requires visibility analysis for visible plumes and
FLM notification only for new or modified major sources that emit
PM<SUB>10</SUB><SUB>10</SUB> or NO<SUB>X</SUB> in excess of 15 tons/year
of <SUB>10</SUB>PM<SUB>10</SUB> or 40 tons/year of NO<SUB>X</SUB> and are
located within specific distances of Federal Class I areas in the of the
AQMD.  The applicable emission thresholds for PM<SUB>10</SUB><SUB> </SUB>
and NO<SUB>X</SUB> correspond to the trigger levels for major modifications
in areas which are in attainment of the relevant NAAQS, namely, 15 tons/year
of PM<SUB>10</SUB> and 40 tons/year of NO<SUB>X.</SUB>  All other criteria
pollutants do not affect plume formation or regional haze and therefore,
are not part of this analysis. The only applicable pollutant for Rule 2005
is NO<SUB>X </SUB> since PM<SUB>10</SUB> is not subject to Regulation XX
- RECLAIM.  Visible plume modeling is required only for projects that meet
or exceed the clearly established emission thresholds and proximity values
from Federal Class I areas.  The proposed rule amendment also contains
requirements for visible plume modeling and specifies certain technical
parameters to be used.
<P>If initial modeling identifies potential adverse impacts on visible plumes
in a Federal Class I area, additional detailed modeling is required.  The
rule provides guidance to the Executive Officer relative to permitting and
noticing actions, and specifies time limits for FLM review actions so that
permit applications are not unduly impacted.  In the very unlikely event
that a new or modified major stationary source is expected to cause an adverse
impact on visibility in a Federal Class I area, the Executive Officer may
be required to deny the permit.  The applicant always has the option of modifying
the project or providing mitigations to obviate any potential adverse impact
on visibility, in order to obtain a permit from the AQMD.  Attachment B shows
the permit action flowcharts for both proposed rules which captures the essence
of this proposal.
<P><B>AQMP &amp; Legal Mandates</B>
<P>The AQMD is required to comply with federal and state NSR requirements,
including visibility protection analysis and notification of FLMs as set
forth in the CAA.  This proposal meets these requirements without an undue
administrative burden to industry, the AQMD, or other agencies.
<P><B>CEQA &amp; Socioeconomic Analysis</B>
<P>The AQMD has reviewed the proposed projects pursuant to Act (CEQA Guidelines
Section 15002(k) - Three-Step Process, to determine which type of CEQA document
to prepare for the proposed action.  The AQMD has determined that the proposed
amendments are exempt from CEQA pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Section 15308
- Action by Regulatory Agencies for the Protection of the Environment, since
the activity is covered by this Class 8 exemption for actions to assure the
maintenance, restoration, enhancement, or protection of the environment.
<P>The Notice of Exemption, prepared pursuant to state CEQA Guidelines Section
15062 - Notice of Exemption, will be filed with the county clerks of Los
Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties immediately following
the adoption of the proposal.
<P>A socioeconomic impact assessment will be prepared for part of the adopt
hearing package.  The approach proposed in the rule is not expected to result
in significant financial impact on facilities and will result in much lower
compliance costs than if the rule were implemented at a lower threshold.
<P><B>Implementation Plan</B>
<P>AQMD permitting staff are responsible for implementation of NSR, while
AQMD planning staff can assist with modeling analyses.  Staff will be trained
on the changes to Regulation XIII and will provide technical assistance to
applicants regarding the new requirements for modeling and FLM notifications.
 The FLMs are committed to review visibility modeling results and provide
written comments to the Executive Officer for projects that meet the
applicability thresholds contained in Proposed Amended Rules 1303 and 2005.
<P><B>Resource Impact</B>
<P>Current AQMD resources are sufficient to implement the proposed rule
amendments rules with negative budget impact.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Amend Rule 1902 - Transportation Conformity
</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Synopsis:</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Proposed amendments to Rule 1902 include:  1) replacing Section
(f) of
the rule with an approved MOU to implement interagency consultation with
SCAG and other transportation agencies; and 2) incorporating final changes
in the federal Transportation Conformity Rule that occurred in 1995.  On
March 14, 1996, a public workshop was held to receive input.  Based upon
public comments received the proposed changes to Rule 1902 have been finalized
for Board consideration.
</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Committee:</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mobile Source, April 26, 1996, Recommended for Approval
</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Recommended Action:</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>1. Amend Rule 1902 - Transportation Conformity.
<BR>2. Adopt the attached Resolution.
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<BR> Executive Officer
<P><FONT SIZE=-1>BW:CLW:LT:CD:GQT</FONT>
<P><HR>
<P><B>Background</B>
<P>In September 1994, the Board adopted Rule 1902 - Transportation Conformity
which codifies the federal transportation requirements in the South Coast
Air Quality Management District.  At the time of adoption, AQMD staff was
participating in a regionwide endeavor to develop an MOU which establishes
the process for interagency consultation as specified in the federal
transportation conformity rule.  Participating agencies included:  AQMD,
SCAG, ARB, EPA, Caltrans, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation
Authority, Orange County Transportation Authority, San Bernardino Associated
Governments, Riverside County Transportation Commission, Federal Highway
Administration, and the Federal Transit Administration.  The adopting resolution
for Rule 1902 stipulated that Subdivision (f) of the rule would be replaced
with the MOU once all participating agencies had signed it.  The signatures
have now been obtained, with the exception of EPA which has committed to
sign the MOU when it is forwarded as part of the SIP revision.  AQMD is seeking
approval to amend Rule 1902 and subsequently the SIP.
<P>In addition, on August 7, 1995, EPA published amendments to the federal
Transportation Conformity rule in the Federal Register.  These amendments
basically aligned the timing of the lapse of conformity determination as
a result of state air quality plan failures with the timing of federal highway
sanctions.  On November 14, 1995, EPA published further amendments to the
rules on transportation conformity.  These further amendments allowed any
transportation control measure from an approved SIP to proceed even though
the conformity status of the transportation plan or program has lapsed. 
Rule 1902 must now be amended to reflect these changes.  This letter will
serve as the staff report.
<P><B>Transportation Conformity</B>
<P>The CAA sets out specific requirements to ensure that no federal actions
interfere with a regional air quality attainment demonstration.  Section
176 of the CAA identifies limitations of federal assistance and defines
conformity as conforming to the intent of the applicable SIP. To conform
to a SIP's purpose, the action must not:  cause or contribute to new violations
of any pollutant standard; increase the frequency or severity of any existing
violations; interfere with timely attainment or maintenance of any pollutant
standard; delay emission reduction milestones; or, contradict SIP requirements.
<P><B>Memorandum of Understanding</B>
<P>An MOU to implement the interagency consultation requirements of Rule
1902 has been developed with SCAG and other transportation agencies (Attachment
A).  The MOU addresses policies and procedures on interagency consultation,
public involvement, and conflict resolution.  The MOU outlines the roles
and responsibilities of the various public agencies in the development process
of the regional transportation projects and conformity analyses.
<P>At its October 1995 Meeting, the AQMD Board approved the preliminary
Transportation Conformity MOU and directed the Executive Officer to schedule
a public hearing to revise Rule 1902 once all of the necessary signatures
were received.  SCAG was the agency responsible for obtaining signatures
from participating agencies in the region.  The ARB was given the task of
obtaining the remaining signatures from EPA, Federal Highway Administration,
and Federal Transit Administration.  Signatures have been obtained from all
of the participating agencies with the exception of EPA, and upon approval
from the Board, the MOU will replace Subdivision (f) of Rule 1902.
<P><B>Amendments to Federal Conformity Rule</B>
<P>On August 7, 1995, EPA published amendments in the Federal Register as
a final rule.  The amendments aligned the timing of certain consequences
of state air quality planning failures under EPA's transportation conformity
rule with the imposition of CAA highway sanctions.  If an implementation
plan for ozone, carbon monoxide, particulate matter or NO<SUB>2</SUB> is
disapproved, the existing conformity determination will remain in effect
until highway sanctions for the disapproval are put into effect under CAA
sanctions.
<P>On November 14, 1995, EPA published further amendments in the Federal
Register.  Under the revised rule, TCMs included in approved SIPs and previous
conforming transportation plans would be allowed continued implementation
even if the status of the transportation plan or transportation improvement
program lapsed.  EPA's logic is that the TCMs are designed to improve air
quality and disallowing them because of a conformity lapse would be
counter-productive to the intent of the federal conformity regulations.
<P>This amendment would extend the grace period to determine conformity to
newly submitted SIPs to 18 months.  The revised rule would also bring the
conformity lapse period in line with the date of CAA highway sanctions for
failure to submit a SIP or submission of an inadequate SIP.  Under the CAA,
highway sanctions would be put in place 24 months after the determination
of an inadequate SIP or failure to submit a SIP.  The final component of
the second set of amendments requires that ozone nonattainment or maintenance
areas be consistent with the NO<SUB>x</SUB> motor vehicle emissions budgets
in control strategy SIPs and maintenance plans, regardless of any previous
conformity NO<SUB>x</SUB> waiver.  A transportation conformity SIP revision
consistent with these amendments must be submitted to EPA by 12 months from
November 14, 1995.
<P><B>California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and Socioeconomic Impacts</B>
<P>Pursuant to CEQA, AQMD staff has reviewed the proposed amendments to Rule
1902 and has determined that they are exempt from the requirements of CEQA
and therefore, do not require an environmental or socioeconomic impacts
assessment.  A Notice of Exemption has been prepared for the proposed amendments
and will be filed with the county clerks immediately following the adoption
of the amendments.
<P><B>Public Comment</B>
<P>On March 14, 1996, a public workshop was held to receive input and begin
the public comment for a 30 day period.  During this timeframe, no written
or verbal comments were received.

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Background</FONT></B>
<P>
Proposed Rule 1623 is the second off-road MSERC program to be
considered for adoption.  On September 8, 1995, the Board adopted
Rule 1620 - Credits for Clean Off-Road Equipment which provides
a mechanism for off-road equipment operators to generate MSERCs
for the retrofitting, purchase, or repowering of certain types
of off-road equipment to meet low- or zero-emission emission levels.
 Proposed Rule 1623 continues the AQMD's efforts to develop programs
to generate credits for off-road equipment for use in complying
with other AQMD regulations.<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Proposal</FONT></B>
<P>
The proposed rule provides a mechanism for issuing NOx, VOC, CO,
and PM MSERCs to anyone who voluntarily implements any one of
three strategies:  <BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>(1) before January 1, 1999, permanently scrap and
replace existing (pre-1995) lawn and garden equipment with new
equipment which meets the 1995 California Emission Standards for
Utility and Lawn and Garden Engines; <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>(2) permanently scrap and replace existing lawn and
garden equipment with new low- or zero-emission equipment (i.e.,
equipment which meets the 1999 California Emission Standards for
Utility and Lawn and Garden Engines, electric-powered equipment);
or <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>(3) after May 10, 1996 and prior to January 1, 1999,
sell directly to an end user new low-emission lawn and garden
equipment, or after January 1, 1991, sell directly to an end user
new zero-emission equipment.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Proposed Rule 1623 establishes requirements for submission
of applications, issuance of credits, MSERC calculation, use of
credits, recordkeeping and enforcement.  MSERCs issued under Proposed
Rule 1623 may be used as RECLAIM Trading Credits, New Source Review
(NSR) offsets, as an alternative method of compliance with AQMD
Regulation XI rules with future compliance dates, and as a method
of compliance with Rule 2202.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>Relationship to Intercredit Trading Program</B>
<P>
Two issues relating to the issuance of MSERCs under Proposed Rule
1623 are addressed by AQMD's proposed Intercredit Trading Program.
 The two issues are:  MSERCs may be replaced with a universal
trading credit; and the lifetime of credits issued under the proposed
rule may be extended beyond two years.  Subdivision (m) was added
to Proposed Rule 1623 to ensure future consistency with any forthcoming
Intercredit Program rules.<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>AQMP &amp; Legal Mandates</FONT></B>
<P>
The proposed rule meets the 1994 AQMP commitment in Control Measures
MOF-03 and MOF-04 to adopt voluntary strategies to generate MSERCs
from off-road sources.  The proposed rule is intended to provide
an alternative means of compliance with AQMD regulations, as well
as accelerate the retirement of old high-polluting lawn and garden
equipment and increased use of new low- or zero-emission equipment.

<P>
Pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and
the AQMD's Certified Regulatory Program (Rule 110), the AQMD has
prepared a Final Environmental Assessment (EA) for the proposed
rule.  The Draft EA was released on March 8, 1996, for a 30-day
review and comment period.  The Final EA determined that the proposed
rule generated no adverse environmental impacts.  Responses to
the one comment received on the Draft EA are included in the Final
EA.<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>Background</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>State law (Health and Safety Code Section 40720)
which took effect last year requires that the draft budget and
revenue projection for the ensuing fiscal year be prepared and
made available by April 1. That law also requires the AQMD Governing
Board to adopt a final proposed operating budget, including final
fee schedules, prior to May 15. The approved final proposed operating
budget must be submitted to the Legislature and the California
ARB annually by May 15. The final proposed operating budget submitted
by the AQMD becomes operative on July 1 unless, prior to July
1, the Legislature enacts an urgency statute amending or supplementing
the proposed AQMD budget, or the AQMD adopts a revised final budget
pursuant to the comments or formal recommendations made by the
state board.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>AQMD has responded to the concerns raised by businesses
and the Legislature regarding the cost and effectiveness of its
programs. AQMD has cut its work force by 34% and reduced its program
costs by 15.2% ($17.2 million) overall. In real dollars, the AQMD
budget is 24.2% less than the 1991-92 budget. Over the last five
years AQMD also has implemented regulatory reform to introduce
market-based principles in cleaning up urban air, has automated
permit processing to provide speedy issuance of permits, privatized
to improve operational efficiency, and remained committed to treating
regulated businesses like valued customers.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>Proposal</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>This year's proposal reflects AQMD's ongoing efforts
to re-evaluate program activities in support of our state and
federal clean air mandates. In FY 1996-97 we will continue emphasis
in the areas of regulatory reform as set forth in the Business
Clean Air Partnership and the subsequent Regulatory Reform Initiatives
adopted by the Governing Board; implementation of the Title V
program; development of the 1997 AQMPs for ozone and for PM<SUB>10</SUB>;
further streamlining of the permit program; and increased emphasis
on the development and transfer of new air quality-enhancing technology.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>Resource Impacts</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>The proposed budget for FY 1996-97 includes a further
staff reduction of 4%, from 796 to 764 positions, and expenditure
reduction of approximately $2.1 million over last year's approved
budget. To partially offset declining revenues and increased costs
for services and supplies, this year's proposal includes an across-the-board
fee increase of just 1.2% pursuant Health &amp; Safety Code Section
40523 which limits any such increase to the change in the state
Consumer Price Index.<BR>

<p><b>PROPOSAL: </b></p>

<p>Set Public Hearing August 9, 1996 to Amend Rule 1113 - Architectural
Coatings
<br></p>
</ul>

<p><b>SYNOPSIS: </b></p>

<p>The proposed amendment will reinstate the small container exemption.

<br>
<br></p>
</ul>

<p><b>COMMITTEE: </b></p>

<br></p>
</ul>

<p><b>RECOMMENDED ACTION:</b> </p>

<ul>
<p>Set Public Hearing August 9, 1996 to Amend Rule 1113 - Architectural
Coatings.
<br>
<br>
<br></p>
</ul>

<p><b>James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<br>Executive Officer</b>
<br></p>

<p><font SIZE=-2>PL:JPB:FL:NB</font>
<br>
<hr></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Background</font></b>
<br>
<br></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>The rule is applicable to manufacturers, distributors,
and end-users of Architectural and Industrial Maintenance (AIM) coatings.
It was first adopted in 1977, and has undergone numerous amendments. The
purpose of the rule is to reduce VOC emissions from the use of </font>
<br></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>AIM coatings, primarily by placing VOC limits on various
coating categories. The small container exemption had been a part of Rule
1113 since the original rule, and remains a part of the architectural coating
rules of other California air districts, as well as the proposed national
AIM coating rule. Based on the language inserted into the rule during the
February 1990 hearing, the small container exemption expired on December
31, 1993.</font> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Over forty coating manufacturers filed and received variances
from the AQMD Hearing Board for their non-compliant coatings sold in small
containers over the past two and one-half years. In December 1993, the
Hearing Board granted a six-month regular variance to a group of manufacturers
and distributors to allow them to continue sales of coatings in small containers.
In June 1994, the Hearing Board extended the regular variance for another
six months. During that period, the AQMD sponsored legislation (Assembly
Bill 2680, Bowen) to allow manufacturers to obtain product variances. This
modified variance not only provided variance protection for the applicant
(typically the manufacturer), but also the end-users. However, the legislation
limited this product variance period to only two years.</font> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>In December 1994, the Hearing Board granted a product
variance, under California Health and Safety Code, Section 42352.5, to
manufacturers seeking protection for continuing to sell non-compliant coatings
in small containers. In December 1995, the manufacturers received an additional
year (and the last) of variance protection under the product variances.</font>
<br></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>During the public hearing relating to aerosol coatings
in March 1996, industry requested the AQMD Governing Board to reinstate
the small container exemption. However, the Governing Board was unable
to make the requested change at that time due to the lack of a CEQA document
to address the potential significant impact resulting from the reinstatement.
During that hearing, the Governing Board adopted a resolution to address
the small container exemption in the August 1996 public hearing.</font>
<br></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Staff had publicly proposed rule amendments to reinstate
the small container exemption and to revise VOC limits for other coating
categories to be heard in August. Due to a large number of issues raised
by industry regarding certain of those proposed amendments to lower VOC
limits, staff has decided to continue working with industry and to delay
those amendments to the September 13, 1996 Governing Board meeting. As
a result, staff is proposing to only address the small container exemption
at the August hearing, so the Governing Board may meet its commitment to
industry.</font>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Staff's general conclusions and recommendations are as
follows: </font></p>

<ul>
<li><font SIZE=+1>The small container exemption is necessary to have available
coatings for touch-up and repair work, as well as some specialty coatings.
This action would result in a cost saving to industry. This small container
exemption should be effective the date of adoption.</font> </li>

<li><font SIZE=+1>An additional proposal will be presented to the Governing
Board in September 1996, which will include mitigations for the emissions
increase from this proposal.</font>
<br>
<br>
<br></li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Proposal</font></b> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>The proposed amendment will </font></p>

<ul>
<li><font SIZE=+1>reinstate the small container exemption.</font> </li>

<li><font SIZE=+1>&nbsp;</font>
<br>
<br></li>
</ul>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Industry has not expressed any concerns regarding the
proposed amendment. USEPA comments have been received and incorporated
into the proposed rule.</font>
<br></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Policy Issues</font></b> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>There are no policy issues associated with the proposed
amendment.</font>
<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>AQMP and Legal Mandates</font></b> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>On October 14, 1994, the Governing Board adopted a resolution
that requires staff to address whether proposed rules being considered
for adoption are scheduled such that the most cost-effective proposed rules,
as defined in the 1994 AQMP, are submitted to the Governing Board prior
to less cost-effective proposals. The proposed amendment was not included
in the 1994 AQMP, since it will not achieve additional emission reductions.
Rather, it will result in an increase in VOC emissions by 0.5 tons per
day over the current rule requirements. However, there will be no change
in actual current VOC emissions since the manufacturers have continuously
received variances to continue using the small container exemption. This
estimate of potential increases in emissions is based on excess emission
reports submitted by the manufacturers operating under their variances.</font>
<br></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>On March 8, 1996, the Governing Board adopted a resolution
that required staff to propose the reinstatement of the small container
exemption at the August 1996 public hearing. The proposed amendment complies
with that resolution.</font>
<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>CEQA</font></b> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>AQMD staff has reviewed the proposed amendment to Rule
1113, and has determined that the reinstatement of the small container
exemption will result in an estimated emissions increase of 0.5 tons per
day over the current rule requirement. This increase is considered to be
significant under CEQA. A Draft Environmental Assessment (EA) was prepared
and circulated for public review. The comment period will end at noon of
July 29, 1996.</font>
<br></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Socioeconomic Analysis</font></b>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Overall, the proposed amendment will allow manufacturers
to continue selling their noncompliant coatings in small containers without
obtaining a variance from the Hearing Board. This should result in an overall
cost saving to these manufacturers.</font> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>.</font>
<br></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Implementation Plan</font></b> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>A notice will be sent to all AIM coating manufacturers.
</font>
<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Resource Impact</font></b> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Existing AQMD resources will be sufficient to implement
the proposed change to this rule with minimal impact on the budget. </font>

<h3 align=center>Execute Contracts for Air Quality Investment Program for
the First Quarter of 1996</h3>

<p>
<hr></p>

<p><b>BOARD MEETING DATE: July 14, 1996 </b></p>

<p>AGENDA NO. 5
<br></p>

<p><b>PROPOSAL: </b></p>

<ul>
<p>Execute Contracts for Air Quality Investment Program for the First Quarter
of 1996
<br></p>
</ul>

<p><b>SYNOPSIS: </b></p>

<ul>
<p>Rule 2202 - On-Road Motor Vehicle Mitigation Options was adopted on
December 8, 1995. As one compliance strategy, Rule 2202 allows employers
to invest in the AQIP. Monies received are placed in a restricted account
to fund programs that result in equivalent emission reductions than would
otherwise have been achieved by the participating employers. Staff evaluated
the proposals received during the first quarter of 1996 and this action
is to recommend several for funding. The amount available for this quarter
is $2,987,004.
<br></p>
</ul>

<p><b>COMMITTEE: </b></p>

<ul>
<p>Mobile Source, May 17, 1996, less than three members were present and
therefore, pursuant to the Procedures for Standing Committees of the Governing
Board, the Committee provides this communication but no recommendation.
<br></p>
</ul>

<p><b>RECOMMENDED ACTION: </b></p>

<ul>
<p>Authorize the Chairman to execute contracts for a total amount not to
exceed $2,671,299 from the Air Quality Investment Program Special Revenue
Fund to obtain mobile source emission reductions with: Southeast Community
Development Corporation (SCDC) for an amount not to exceed $176,000; Whittier
Union High School District for an amount not to exceed $540,000; Santa
Barbara Research Center for an amount not to exceed $578,956, and Ecology
Auto Wrecking, Inc. for an amount not to exceed $1,376,343.
<br>
<br>
<br></p>
</ul>

<p><b>James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<br>Executive Office</b>
<br></p>

<p><font SIZE=-2>BW:CLW:LT:CD:ENL</font> 
<hr></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Background</font></b> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>In December 1995 the Governing Board rescinded Rule 1501.1
and adopted Rule 2202 - On-Road Motor Vehicle Mitigation Options. The Rule
2202 Air Quality Investment Program (AQIP) allows all employers to participate
by electing to invest in an AQMD-administered restricted fund. Investment
can be either $60 annually per employee reporting to the worksite during
the 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. peak window, or $125 per employee triennially.
The restricted monies are to be used by the AQMD to fund proposals that
achieve mobile source emission reductions that would otherwise have been
achieved by implementing a rideshare program. This Board letter contains
a discussion regarding the dispersal of funds from the AQIP compliance
option for the first quarter of 1996.</font>
<br></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Upon registering under this option and submitting the
designated investment amount, an employer is considered to be in compliance
with the rule and there is no need for the employer to take further action
to reduce mobile source emissions. The collected monies are to be used
to fund alternative mobile source emission reduction strategies that reduce
mobile source emissions at a more cost-effective rate and that could potentially
result in greater overall emission reductions.</font>
<br></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>In effect, an employer using the AQIP compliance option
is transferring to the AQMD the responsibility for achieving emission reductions
equivalent to the pooled emission reduction targets of all employers participating
in the fund. The AQMD becomes an intermediary, responsible for funding
projects that will obtain equivalent emission reductions/air quality improvements
through the contract process.</font>
<br></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Proposal Evaluation</font></b> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>The first quarter of 1996 submittal period ended on March
29, 1996. The total AQIP funds received during this period was $2,987,004.
This amount includes both annual and triennial participants. The annual
program contributions of $970,504 from 103 worksites will be used to purchase
a single year of emission reductions; participation by county is noted
in Attachment 1, Table 1. The triennial program contributions of $2,016,500
from 88 worksites will be used to purchase three years of emission reductions;
participation by county is noted in Attachment 1, Table 2. In addition,
there is $119,296 carried over from previous quarters. (See Table 3 of
Attachment 1).</font>
<br></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>During the first quarter fourteen proposals were received
requesting funds ranging from $84,480 to $2,920,000. The proposed projects
received can be grouped in five categories: old-vehicle scrapping; alternative
vehicle deployment/transit improvement; ridematching software/hardware;
remote sensing; and off-road engine technology. Attachment 2 gives a summary
of each proposal received, and funds requested, while Attachment 3 lists
the proposals received, funds requested, total proposal costs, and emission
reductions expected for each proposal. Attachment 4 discusses the selection
criteria and summarizes the overall ratings of each proposal.</font>
<br></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>All proposals submitted are reviewed and scored based
on the information in the proposal as submitted to the AQMD, and according
to the selection criteria described in the RFP. The RFP scoring process
consists of two steps. The first step is technical in which each proposal
is assigned points based on: the potential of a proposed project to result
in transportation technology and infrastructure improvements; the potential
to achieve emissions reductions relative to the quarterly targets; and
the overall expertise of the firm. In the second step the proposals are
scored according to cost effectiveness, if the firm is a local business
enterprise, and if it is a certified MBE/WBE/DVBE company or joint venture.</font>
<br></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>The following proposals are recommended for approval:
</font>
<br></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>1. <b>Southeast Community Development Corporation</b>
(SCDC) $ 176,000</font> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>The proposal is a transit improvement project that includes
flexible rail feeder shuttles equipped with intelligent transportation
systems. The shuttles will be CNG-fueled and are anticipated to provide
services to the surrounding communities and local businesses. The $176,000
funding requested will be leveraged by an additional $1,210,160 to be provided
by other participating funding sources.</font> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>2. <b>Whittier Union High School District</b>. $ 540,000</font>
</p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>The project is to implement a comprehensive alternative
fuel vehicle and school bus (CNG) deployment with its partners, that include
both public and private entities. The project includes the construction
of a public access CNG fueling station that will accommodate all vehicle
classes. Whittier Union High School District plans to deploy 30 full-size
school buses, 7 vans, and 239 light-duty CNG-powered vehicles as part of
the full scale program. In addition, the concept of clean fuel vehicles
will be introduced as part of the educational curriculum. Furthermore,
the $540,000 funding requested will be leveraged by an additional $9,394,000
to be provided by the project partners. This project will result in substantial
short- and long-term NOx emission reductions in addition to the VOC and
CO emission reductions anticipated. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>3. <b>Santa Barbara Research Center</b> $ 578,956</font>
</p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>The proposed project is to implement a remote sensing
testing and repair program at local colleges and universities. The proposal
includes the testing of 60,000 vehicles, and the repair of approximately
600 of the worst high emitting vehicles. This project will produce significant
VOC and CO emission reductions and could greatly contribute to the commercialization
of the remote sensing technology as a viable compliance option under Rule
2202. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>4. <b>Ecology Auto Wrecking, Inc.</b> $1,376,343</font>
</p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>This project will generate mobile source emission reduction
credits (MSERCs) through an old-vehicle scrapping program with the purchase
of triennial credits. The MSERCs generated will be to supplement the anticipated
emission reductions of the above projects to meet the emission reduction
targets established by the level of employer participation in the AQIP.
</font>
<br></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>For the first quarter of 1996, the total recommended funding
amount is $2,671,299 (see Attachment 1, Table 6). These funds will be leveraged
with an additional $10,604,160 of co-funding. Any remaining AQIP funds
would be held for future proposal funding in subsequent quarters. Both
annual and triennial AQIP emission reduction targets for each performance
target zone and for all participants during the first quarter 1996 will
be met by the recommended proposals (see Tables 4 and 5 of Attachment 1).</font>
<br></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Outreach</font></b> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>The AQIP announcement was mailed to all Rule 2202 employers
(approximately 5,000 worksites). Furthermore, the availability of AQIP
funds and the RFP was advertised in the Los Angeles Times, Orange County
Register, Riverside Press Enterprise, Los Angeles Sentinel, Eastern Group
Publications, San Bernardino Sun, La Voz, La Opinion, Rafu Shimpo, Precinct
Reporter, The Black Voice News, Chinese Daily News, Korea Central Daily,
El Chicano, The Excelsior, Philippine News, The M/W/DVBE Source, and the
California State Contracts Register. Copies of the AQIP announcement and
the RFP were sent to the Black and Latino Legislative Caucuses and interested
minority contractors/professional associations, transportation management
associations and organizations (TMA/TMO), members of the Consultants Roundtable,
attendees at AQIP bidder's conferences, and any interested party.</font>
<br></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Resource Impact</font></b> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>During the first three quarters of the program's existence,
$3,680,920 in AQIP fees have been collected. Of that amount, $204,425 was
authorized by the Board and subsequently was expended. In March of this
year, the Board approved the staff recommendation to expend $402,803 but,
because of concerns about the outcome and potential impact of State Senate
Bill 836 (Lewis), postponed the execution of the associated contracts.
That posture has continued to date as this bill has gone through a number
of amendments. While this bill could still prohibit the AQMD from continuing
the AQIP, it has been amended from the initial version in which it directed
the refund of all AQIP funds collected, to its current version which directs
a refund of only those funds which are unspent. Given this change, and
the need to achieve equivalent emission reductions, staff believes it is
now appropriate to move forward with project funding.</font>

<p><b>BOARD MEETING DATE: July 12, 1996 </b></p>

<p>AGENDA NO. 6 </p>

<p>Continued from June 14, 1996
<br></p>

<p><b>PROPOSAL: </b></p>

<ul>
<p>Execute Contracts for Air Quality Investment Program for the Final Quarter
of 1995 </p>
</ul>

<p><b>SYNOPSIS: </b></p>

<ul>
<p>On March 8, 1996, the Board approved in concept the staff recommendations
to execute contracts for the AQIP. At that time staff was directed to return
to the Board for final approval. Staff recommends that the Board approve
the release of AQIP funds for the final quarter funding of 1995.
<br></p>
</ul>

<p><b>COMMITTEE:</b> </p>

<ul>
<p>Mobile Source, April 26, 1996, Recommended for Approval 
<br></p>
</ul>

<p><b>RECOMMENDED ACTION:</b> </p>

<ul>
<p>1. Authorize the Chairman to execute a contract in an amount not to
exceed $49,308, from the Air Quality Investment Program Special Revenue
Fund, with Lapis Energy (Chino and Desert Sand Unified School Districts)
for purchase of three years of equivalent emission reductions and to exercise
the 120-day agreement of the previously approved contract with Eco-Scrap
in an amount not to exceed $352,495. </p>

<p>2. Direct the Executive Officer to deem in compliance all employers
participating in the AQIP between July 1, 1995 and December 7, 1995 for
an additional two years.
<br></p>
</ul>

<p><font SIZE=-2>BRW:CLW:LT:CD:ENL</font>
<br></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Background</font></b> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>On March 8, 1996, the Board approved in concept staff's
AQIP funding recommendations for the final quarter of 1995 which were to
fund the Lapis Energy (Chino and Desert Sand Unified School Districts)
proposal to replace 13 diesel-powered school buses with CNG-powered buses
and to exercise the 120-day option with Eco-Scrap to purchase the remaining
second and third year emission reduction credits. The Board did not authorize
executing these two recommendations due to pending legislation that would
prohibit AQMD from continuing with the AQIP and require AQMD to return
a portion of the funds collected under the AQIP. Staff was directed to
return to the Board, prior to the expiration of the 120-day option, no
later than May 18, 1996, for final approval. However, because there was
no resolution to the pending legislation prior to the May or June Board
meetings, Eco-Scrap agreed to extend the 120-day option.</font>
<br></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Proposal Evaluation</font></b> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Staff recommends that the Board approve the release of
funding for the Lapis Energy (Chino and Desert Sand Unified School Districts)
proposal for $49,308 and exercise the 120-day option with Eco-Scrap for
$352,495. For the final quarter of 1995, the total funding amount that
staff recommends the Board approve is $401,803. Any remaining AQIP funds
would be held for future proposal funding in subsequent quarters. All employers
participating in the AQIP between July 1, 1995 and December 7, 1995 would
be deemed in compliance for an additional two years. </font>
<br></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>The resulting emission reductions will meet the total
required equivalent emission reductions for all Rule 1501.1 - Alternatives
to Work Trip Reduction Plans affected worksites participating in the third
and fourth quarters of 1995 for a full three-year period at a similar cost
to Rule 2202. In other words, employers who have paid $110 per employee
from July 1, 1995 through December 7, 1995 under Rule 1501.1 would receive
credit for three years of compliance instead of one. This action would
help level the playing field because once Rule 2202 was adopted on December
8, 1995 employers paid $125 for each peak window employee for a triennial
compliance option. Any carryover monies from the previous quarters will
be combined with the next quarter's funding for the next round of proposals
to be considered.</font>
<br></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Execution of these funding recommendations will complete
the AQIP funding pursuant to rescinded Rule 1501.1 and will allow the Board
to proceed with AQIP funding under Rule 2202.</font>

<p><b><font COLOR="#000000">SYNOPSIS:</font></b> </p>

<ul>
<p><font COLOR="#000000">Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation
Authority (LACMTA) staff is considering converting its methanol bus fleet
to operate on other fuels. To evaluate all options for the methanol buses,
LACMTA plans to evaluate retrofitting the buses to operate on compressed
natural gas (CNG) or other fuels. LACMTA has requested financial assistance
to support the conversion of one methanol bus to CNG to determine the feasibility
of this approach. AQMD's cost-share will not exceed $75,000. Total project
cost is approximately $192,800.</font>

</ul>

<p><b><font COLOR="#000000">RECOMMENDED ACTION:</font></b> </p>

<ul>
<p><font COLOR="#000000">Authorize the Chairman to execute a contract with
the Southern California Gas Company or LACMTA for the conversion of one
LACMTA methanol bus to compressed natural gas, in an amount not to exceed
$75,000.</font>
<br></p>
</ul>

<p><b><font COLOR="#000000">James M. Lents, Ph.D.

<br></p>

<p><font COLOR="#000000"><font SIZE=-2>CSL:ARA:CS</font></font> 
<hr></p>

<p><b><font COLOR="#000000"><font SIZE=+1>Background</font></font></b>
</p>

<p><font COLOR="#000000">Emissions from heavy-duty diesel vehicles contribute
significantly to the Basin's poor air quality. Transit buses are particularly
noticeable to the public, and an effort has been made to encourage the
use of alternative fuels in transit buses. LACMTA has operated 333 methanol-fueled
transit buses since 1991. Although these buses have considerably lower
emissions, their cost of operation is higher than their diesel counterparts.
</font>
<br></p>

<p><font COLOR="#000000">LACMTA staff has requested its Board of Directors
for approval to convert the 333 methanol bus fleet to operate on diesel
fuel. As an alternative, it has been suggested that the methanol buses
could be converted to operate on compressed natural gas, thus continuing
to contribute to emissions reductions. In order to evaluate the feasibility
of converting the methanol bus fleet, LACMTA staff obtained Board authority
to convert three methanol buses to operate on various diesel technologies.
In addition the Board directed LACMTA staff to evaluate the possibility
of modifying a methanol bus to operate on CNG.</font>
<br></p>

<p><b><font COLOR="#000000">Proposal</font></b> </p>

<p><font COLOR="#000000">LACMTA has requested assistance from the Southern
California Gas Company and the AQMD, as well as other interested parties,
to support the effort to convert one of the methanol buses to CNG.</font>
<br></p>

<p><font COLOR="#000000">The proposed project, with the Southern California
Gas Company in the lead, will modify one methanol transit bus to operate
on CNG. The modification will include removal of all methanol-related components
and installation of a CNG engine, fuel storage cylinders, fuel delivery
system, and other CNG-related components. After completion of the modification,
a field test will be conducted to ascertain the operational characteristics
and performance of the CNG bus. A cost analysis will be performed to determine
the cost to convert all the methanol buses to operate on CNG. Finally,
LACMTA will conduct emissions testing to determine the comparable emissions
reductions.</font>
<br></p>

<p><font COLOR="#000000">The proposed project falls under Program MS-11,
&quot;Development and Demonstration of Low Emission, Alternative Fuel Technologies
for On-Road Applications,&quot; in the Technology Advancement Plan for
the Clean Fuels Program. Although the completion of this one-bus conversion
and field test will not yield significant emission reductions, the potential
alternative of converting 333 methanol buses to diesel operation will result
in significant emission increases. Upon successful completion of the proposed
retrofit, should LACMTA decide to convert the remaining 332 methanol buses
to CNG, and assuming the use of the latest CNG technology, there is the
potential for even greater emissions reductions than achieved by the methanol
buses.</font>
<br></p>

<p><b><font COLOR="#000000">Sole Source Justification</font></b> </p>

<p><font COLOR="#000000">Section II, Step 3(C) of the Consultant Selection
Policy and Procedure identifies four provisions under which a sole-source
contract may be awarded: (1) cost to prepare documents exceeds cost for
consultant, (2) delay would result in the endangerment of public health,
(3) services are only available from sole-source, (4) other circumstances
exist identifying sole-source as in the best interests of the AQMD. This
request for sole-source award is made under provision (4). It is in AQMD's
best interests to enter into a cost-share agreement with the Southern California
Gas Company or LACMTA to modify a methanol transit bus to operate on CNG,
and test the performance and emissions of that bus. The AQMD contribution
to the project shall not exceed $75,000; total cost of the project is $192,800.</font>
<br></p>

<p><font COLOR="#000000">The Southern California Gas Company will provide
overall project management and, in conjunction with CalStart and NGV Ecotrans,
will assume responsibility for vehicle modification. The LACMTA will provide
technical review, field test participation and emissions testing. The Southern
California Gas Company is a leader in implementing the use of natural gas
in Basin fleets. They have cost-shared the establishment of a CNG fueling
facility at the LACMTA, and have provided technical support to the LACMTA
staff in establishing technical specifications for the procurement of natural
gas buses.</font>
<br></p>

<p><font COLOR="#000000">The work to convert the subject methanol bus to
CNG will be subcontracted to NGV Ecotrans. NGV Ecotrans was established
to provide natural gas vehicle support services, from vehicle retrofit
and engine repowering to ongoing maintenance and repair of natural gas
vehicles. All conversion work for this proposed project will be completed
by NGV Ecotrans and no other subcontracting opportunities for minority-owned,
women-owned or disabled veteran owned business enterprises (MBE/WBE/DVBE)
have been identified. Although NGV Ecotrans is not a MBE/WBE/DVBE , they
are located in an economic development zone of Los Angeles and provide
training and employment for minorities and disadvantaged citizens.</font>
<br></p>

<p><font COLOR="#000000">It is in the AQMD's interest to support the well-qualified
team and resources assembled to complete the proposed project to demonstrate
a clean fuel, low emission, cost-effective conversion alternative to the
replacement of methanol buses with diesel.</font>
<br></p>

<p><b><font COLOR="#000000">Resource Impacts</font></b> </p>

<p><font COLOR="#000000">Total estimated cost of the engine modification,

<p><b>BOARD MEETING DATE: July 12, 1996 </b></p>

<p>AGENDA NO. 9
<br></p>

<p><b>PROPOSAL:</b> </p>

<ul>
<p>Cost Share the Modeling, Design, and Demonstration of a Fuel Cell Power
System for the Advanced Technology Transit Bus (ATTB) 
<br></p>
</ul>

<p><b>SYNOPSIS: </b></p>

<ul>
<p>The Fuel Cell Buyers Consortium (FCBC), a non-profit entity created
by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, has proposed
a project to develop and demonstrate ATTBs powered by fuel cells. In Phase
1, FCBC will model and design a fuel cell system that can be assembled,
installed, and tested in an ATTB testbed. The total cost of Phase 1 is
approximately $1.35 million. AQMD's contribution will not exceed $350,000,
and shall be contingent on cost sharing of at least $1 million from other
funders.
<br></p>
</ul>

<p><b>COMMITTEE: </b></p>

<ul>
<p>Technology, June 12, 1996, Recommended for Approval 
<br></p>
</ul>

<p><b>RECOMMENDED ACTION:</b> </p>

<ul>
<p>Authorize the Chairman to execute a contract with LACMTA in an amount
not to exceed $350,000 to cost share the modeling, design, and demonstration
of a fuel cell system for the ATTB. This contract shall include the following
contingencies: 1) no AQMD funds can be expended until LACMTA obtains firm
written commitments for a minimum total of $1 million in cost sharing from
the funding entities identified in Table 1, and 2) AQMD funds shall be
expended on technical work including modeling, design, and demonstration
of a fuel cell system for the ATTB. </p>
</ul>

<p><b>James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<br>Executive Officer</b>
<br></p>

<p><font SIZE=-2>CSL:ARA:JHL</font>
<br>
<hr></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Background</font></b> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>The AQMP anticipates the commercialization and deployment
of zero-emission transportation systems over the next 15 years. One specific
AQMP target is to phase in electric propulsion technologies for the Basin's
fleet of approximately 4,000 transit buses. Fuel cells are electrochemical
engines that can provide excellent performance and range for transit buses
while being virtually pollution free. LACMTA and other transit districts
are now giving fuel cells serious consideration as commercially viable,
environmentally benign powerplants of the near future. </font>
<br></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>In 1992, LACMTA initiated the Advanced Technology Transit
Bus (ATTB) program using funding from the Federal Transit Administration.
The objective of this national program is to develop, demonstrate, and
commercialize safe, lightweight, low- or zero-emission, fuel-efficient
transit buses. Transit agencies participating in the ATTB program represent
more than half of the national bus fleet. The primary technical contractor,
Northrop Grumman Corporation in El Segundo, is now building six ATTBs featuring
advanced composite materials, a low-floor design, advanced electronics,
and an electric drivetrain. LACMTA expects that these ATTBs will be deployed
in the 1997-98 timeframe. Fuel cells are among the powerplants under consideration
for incorporation into one or more of these prototype transit buses. </font>
<br></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>In May 1994, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors
approved the formation of the FCBC. The primary purpose of this non-profit
entity is to harness public sector buying power as a means to support defense
conversion and growth of a fuel cell industry in Southern California. A
coalition of about thirty local and state government entities, public utilities,
and transit agencies make up the FCBC, which has selected the ATTB program
as the best point of entry for fuel cells into commercial transportation
applications. </font>
<br></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>LACMTA is the lead agency for the FCBC and has been appointed
to be its legal and fiscal agent. The FCBC Board of Directors consists
of Los Angeles County Supervisors Yvonne Brathwaite Burke and Michael Antonovich;
Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan; Councilman James Craigin representing
LACMTA; and Councilwoman Nell Soto representing the AQMD. </font>
<br></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Proposal</font></b> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>FCBC has proposed a two-phased project to develop and
demonstrate one or more ATTBs powered by fuel cells. In Phase 1, FCBC will
model, design, and procure a fuel cell system that can subsequently be
assembled, installed, and tested in an ATTB testbed. The FCBC team includes
fuel cell experts, engineers and scientists from Northrop Grumman, the
Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the University of California at Davis, and the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration. This technical team will
use advanced computer modeling for optimal selection and integration of
all fuel cell powerplant components and subsystems into the overall ATTB
vehicle system. The project will support continuing system improvements
by identifying where to push technology that can benefit future generations
of buses. </font>
<br></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Phase 1 of the FCBC project also includes activities designed
to educate transit districts and manufacturing companies about important
business opportunities involving fuel cell technologies. These activities,
which will not be funded by the AQMD, can help make the Basin a leading
region for manufacturing and marketing of fuel cell technologies. For example,
economic development seminars will be organized by the FCBC to inform local
companies about manufacturing requirements for fuel cell components that
will be used in the ATTB program. Information will be disseminated to help
LACMTA and other transit districts in the Basin become &quot;smart buyers&quot;
who know what specifications should be required when purchasing zero-emission
buses.</font> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>The complete two-phase work program proposed by the FCBC
has been designed to result in a fully packaged fuel cell powerplant integrated
into one or more prototype ATTBs that will be deployed in route service
by 1998. Major milestones for this proposed project are as follows:</font>
<br></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Phase 1</font>
<br></p>

<ul>
<li><font SIZE=+1>Model and design a fuel cell powerplant for the ATTB
(Months 1-15)</font> </li>

<li><font SIZE=+1>Procure basic components for fuel cell powerplant (Months
5-13)</font> </li>

<li><font SIZE=+1>Conduct economic development seminars for local companies
(Months 8-15)</font> </li>

<li><font SIZE=+1>Assemble components in ATTB mobile test bed (Months 12-16)</font>
</li>
</ul>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Phase 2</font>
<br></p>

<ul>
<li><font SIZE=+1>Acquire data from the ATTB test bed to validate and refine
the design (Months 17-18)</font> </li>

<li><font SIZE=+1>Complete fully packaged fuel cell powerplant for ATTB
(Months 19-24)</font> </li>

<li><font SIZE=+1>Integrate the powerplant into a prototype ATTB (Months
25-27)</font> </li>

<li><font SIZE=+1>Complete vehicle shake-down and deploy it in route service
(Months 28-30)</font> </li>
</ul>

<p><font SIZE=+1>AQMD's cost share will specifically be used to fund technical
tasks involving the modeling, design, and demonstration of the fuel cell
system. In addition, the proposed AQMD-LACMTA contract shall contain a
contingency that no AQMD funds can be expended until LACMTA has received
firm commitments for funding from each of the funding entities identified
in Table 1 below, for at least the amount listed.</font>
<br></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>This project is identified in the Technology Advancement
Plan for the Clean Fuels Program as Project MS-08, &quot;Development and
Demonstration of a Fuel Cell-Powered Advanced Technology Transit Bus.&quot;
Immediate benefits of the proposed project include direct emissions reductions
and significant fuel economy improvements in one or more LACMTA transit
buses. From a broader perspective, this project can advance the potential
of fuel cells to become fuel-flexible, zero-emission powerplants of the
future for transit bus fleets throughout the Basin. Finally, commercialization
of the resulting fuel cell-powered ATTB could ultimately result in manufacturing
innovations and the creation of high-technology jobs in Southern California's
aerospace and transportation industries. </font>
<br></p>

<p><b>Sole Source Justification</b> </p>

<p>Section II, Step 3. (C) of the Consultant Selection Policy and Procedure
identifies four provisions under which a sole-source award may be justified:
(1) cost to prepare documents exceeds cost for consultant, (2) delay would
result in the endangerment of public health, (3) services are only available
from sole source, and (4) other circumstances exist identifying sole source
as in the best interests of the AQMD. This request for a sole-source award
is made under provision (4). 
<br></p>

<p>The proposed project involves a multifaceted coalition offering an established
team of funding organizations and highly capable technical contractors
having a unique linkage to the ATTB program. As detailed below, the FCBC
expects to raise at least $1 million in funding to cost share the proposed
project. This project presents a relatively low-risk opportunity for AQMD
to help expedite commercially viable zero-emission transit buses while
also facilitating job creation in the high-technology sector. LACMTA's
principal role in both the ATTB program and the FCBC will help ensure coordination
that is needed for successful development of prototype fuel cell-powered
transit buses.
<br></p>

<p><b>Resource Impacts</b> </p>

<p>The total cost of Phase 1 is estimated to be $1.35 million. Table 1
identifies the anticipated Phase 1 co-funding agencies and their respective
contributions. AQMD's proposed cost-share is $350,000, or 26% of the total
and shall be contingent on FCBC obtaining commitments for, at a minimum,
the co-funding amounts identified in Table 1. The FCBC is also investigating
potential private-enterprise sources of funding, and may expand the scope
of Phase 1 if such funds are procured.

<p><b>PROPOSAL:</b> </p>

<ul>
<p>Recognize and Appropriate Funds from the EPA for Three Air Monitoring
Projects
<br></p>
</ul>

<p><b>SYNOPSIS:</b> </p>

<ul>
<p>EPA has allocated Section 105 and supplemental grant funds to AQMD for
three projects. This action is to recognize and appropriate these funds
to the FY 1996-97 Budget, as follows: (1) $1,216,620 for the fourth year
Photochemical Assessment Monitoring Stations program implementation, (2)
$75,000 in supplemental grant funds for the equipment replacement program
of existing NOx analyzers; and (3) $25,000 in supplemental grant funds
for the PM2.5 project. 
<br></p>
</ul>

<p><b>COMMITTEE:</b> </p>

<ul>
<p>Administrative, June 21, 1996, Recommended for Approval
<br></p>
</ul>

<p><b>RECOMMENDED ACTION:</b> </p>

<ul>
<p>Recognize $1,316,620 in revenue from EPA and, upon receipt of award,
appropriate $1,196,900 from Undesignated Fund Balance for FY 1996-97 as
set forth in Attachment A. The remainder, $119,720, is already appropriated
in the FY 1996-97 Budget.
<br>
<br>
<br></p>
</ul>

<p><b>James M. Lents, Ph.D.</b> </p>

<p><b>Executive Officer</b>
<br></p>

<p><font SIZE=-2>NN:WJF:WG:lm</font> 
<hr></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Background</font></b> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>In February 1993, the United States EPA promulgated the
Photochemical Assessment Monitoring Stations (PAMS) regulations for areas
classified as serious, severe or extreme non-attainment. Those regulations
required AQMD to conduct monitoring for ozone precursors, in this area
adding monitoring equipment at a rate of one site per year, up to a total
of seven sites by 1998. EPA has allocated Section 105 and supplemental
grant funds to AQMD for this purpose. EPA funding has increased annually
to pay for start-up and operational costs. </font>
<br></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>There is $75,000 available in EPA grant funds for monitoring
equipment replacement or upgrading. Staff has been evaluating current equipment
available on the market. A decision will be made by August 1996 on whether
to upgrade existing equipment or to purchase new equipment. </font>
<br></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>EPA has offered the AQMD $25,000 in supplemental grant
funds for purchase of a PM2.5 sampler and operating supplies. EPA has not
yet made a final decision on which types of samplers will be acceptable.
That decision should be made by the end of calendar year 1996.</font>
<br></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Resource Impacts</font></b> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>All the above purchases and subsequent work in the programs
can be accomplished with proposed FY 1996-97 staffing levels and will require
no additional resources in FY 199697. </font>
<br></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>In FY 1996-1997, $1,216,620 is offered to AQMD as part
of the Section 105 grant to establish a fifth site and operate those five
sites for the year. An additional $75,000 in grant funds would be allocated
to the ASTD FY 1996-97 Fixed Asset Major Object for the purchase or upgrade
of eight ambient NOx analyzers. Supplemental grant funds of $25,000 would
be allocated $20,000 to the ASTD FY 1996-97 Fixed Asset Major Object for
the purchase of a PM2.5 sampler and $5,000 to the Services and Supplies
Major Object, Laboratory Supplies account, to proceed with the purchases
following the EPA decision on acceptable equipment.</font>
<br></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Since the receipt of funds by the AQMD constitutes a budget
supplement within the meaning of Health and Safety Code 40720(j), notice
of this proposed supplement was published in the <i>Los Angeles Daily Journal,
San Bernardino Sun, Riverside Press Enterprise, Orange County Register,
</i>and the<i> Inland Valley Bulletin.</i></font>

<p><b>Background</b> </p>

<p>In 1994, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) instituted a Peer
Match Program to assist states, territories and agencies in developing
and implementing their small business assistance programs (SBAPs). EPA
recognized that the benefits achieved by Peer Match (mentoring) exceed
the costs. States and agencies which have participated in Peer Match have
saved money by adopting, rather than recreating, elements of successful
programs.
<br></p>

<p>EPA selected the AQMD as a Peer Match recipient, based on its outstanding
small business assistance program. Section 507 of the Federal Clean Air
Act Amendments of 1990, requires each state to have a SBAP. AQMD's program
was established in 1989 and has already served as a model for several states,
including Texas, Colorado, Pennsylvania, Oregon, and Louisiana. EPA's guidelines
for fund use include: development of training materials, payment of travel
expenses for participants, and long distance telephone expenses.
<br></p>

<p><b>AQMD Responsibility</b> </p>

<p>The Public Advisor's Office will provide training materials and staff
time and resources to conduct the Peer Match training. AQMD also will be
available to assist Peer Match participants on an on-going basis and will
provide on-site assistance if required. Each Peer Match participant will
be asked to complete an evaluation of the assistance they receive. A lessons
learned summary will be prepared. AQMD will provide a written report on
the program results to EPA by December, 1996 and will report back to the
Governing Board.
<br></p>

<p><b>Benefits</b> </p>

<p>Before there was a Peer Match Program, the AQMD and other agencies had
to assume the full cost of sharing information and resources. Some states,
territories and agencies have been slow to implement small business assistance
because they lack the knowledge and resources. In addition, if there exists
a way for the states to get together and share detailed information, resources
developed in one state could enhance the program in another state. Peer
Match facilitates the opportunity for information and resource sharing
by absorbing part of the cost associated with this process. 
<br></p>

<p>By working together, SBAP representatives already have made significant
progress in obtaining EPA policy interpretations that benefit small business
owners/operators nationwide. For example, SBAPs obtained an enforcement
policy guideline which made the information obtained from an on-site consultation
by a SBAP confidential. 
<br></p>

<p>EPA, national trade associations, states, territories and agencies all
have expressed their support for strong small business assistance programs
nationwide. The parties anticipate that these programs will result in better
air pollution control strategies, commonly acceptable clean industry standards,
and information dissemination to equipment and product manufacturers.
<br></p>

<p><b>Resource Impacts</b> </p>

<p>At its April 12, 1996 meeting, AQMD Governing Board recognized a $25,000
Peer Match grant that the EPA awarded the AQMD, and approved the appropriation
of the $25,000 from the Undesignated Fund Balance to the Public Advisor's
Services and Supplies Major Object budget in three accounts as follows:
$20,000 to Travel, $2,000 to Communications and $3,000 to Business Outreach.
<br></p>

<p>EPA and AQMD have implemented the Peer Match Program and expended $2,000
to date. This action carries over the remaining $23,000 of the EPA Peer
Match $25,000 grant to the FY 1996-97 budget to be allocated to the Public
Advisor's Services and Supplies Major Object budget in the following accounts:
$18,000 to Miscellaneous Expense (Travel Reimbursements to other agencies);
$3,000 to Professional and Special Services (Business Outreach); and $2,000
to Communications. 
<br></p>

<p>This constitutes a supplement to the FY 1996-97 budget. Therefore, the
required 30-day public notice of a proposed supplement to the FY 1996-97
budget was published in the Los Angeles Daily Journal, San Bernardino Sun,
Riverside Press Enterprise, Orange County Register and the Inland Valley
Bulletin.

<B>SYNOPSIS: </P><BR>
</B>
<UL>
<LI>AQMD is seeking to pre-qualify vendors providing various library
services and supplies. Vendors selected will be issued blanket
purchase orders for the acquisition, cataloging, and shelf preparation
of books, periodicals, and other printed and multi-media materials
in the AQMD's library. The use of blanket purchase orders facilitates
acquisition of books, articles and reports, and reduces the labor
required to type and process pre-paid purchase orders. This bidding
and pre-qualification process will ensure that the AQMD is using
the most cost-effective providers for these services and supplies.

<P>
In the FY 1996-97 Budget, funds were allocated to maintain current
subscriptions to technical and environmental periodicals, update
the reference collection, and ensure a current collection of environmental
science and technology books and reports, which represent 60 percent
of the library's collection. These materials provide critical
research and reference information on air quality-related topics
and are used extensively by AQMD staff and by outside users, including
other agencies, regulated industries, and the public. </P>
<P>
<B>Proposal</B> </P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Through the attached RFP, the AQMD is seeking to
competitively pre-qualify vendors providing various library services
and supplies. The result will be a staff recommendation to issue
blanket purchase orders to the selected vendors for the acquisition,
cataloging, and shelf preparation of books, periodicals, and other
printed and multi-media materials in the AQMD's library during
FY 1996-97. The use of blanket purchase orders will facilitate
the ordering of these supplies and services and reduce the labor
otherwise required to process purchase orders. This bidding and
pre-qualification process will ensure that AQMD is using the most
cost-effective providers for these services and supplies. Vendors
selected as a result of this RFP process will remain pre-qualified
for a period of two years. <BR>

<br>
<br></p>

<p><font SIZE=-2>BRW:VM:RKV:AG</font> 
<hr></p>

<p><b>Background</b> </p>

<p>In the FY 1996-97 Budget, funds have been allocated for the maintenance
and repair of AQMD's personal computer infrastructure, which includes both
desktop hardware and the connecting telecommunications networks, i.e.,
the Local Area Network (LAN) and the Wide Area Network (WAN). The scope
of the effort requires the provision of both parts and services for a variety
of routine repairs and installation functions for desktop hard-ware and
other telecommunication subsystems (including hard disks, printers, modems,
etc.).
<br></p>

<p><b>Proposal</b> </p>

<p>Through the attached RFP, the AQMD is seeking to competitively pre-qualify
vendors providing the needed desktop hardware and telecommunication parts
and services. These vendors will be used to provide the miscellaneous computer,
network, and telecommunications parts and repair services needed during
FY 1996-97. The use of pre-qualified vendors will facilitate the ordering
of these supplies and services in that they will be the only vendors allowed
to submit quotes for miscellaneous parts and repair services. Parts or
repair services not available from these pre-qualified vendors will be
acquired in accordance with the AQMD's purchasing policy. These bidding
and pre-qualification processes will ensure that the AQMD is using the
most cost-effective providers for these services and supplies. Vendors
selected as a result of this RFP process will remain pre-qualified for

<h3>Weather Cooks up Murky Start to Smog Season</h3>
<p>
Hot, stagnant weather this spring created more smog this year than the same time last year, air quality meteorologists said.
<p>So far, the AQMD has issued 15 health advisories and two Stage 1 episodes.  At this time last year, only five health advisories and no Stage 1 episodes had occurred.
<p>"We've had an unusual spring that resulted in some high smog levels," said James M. Lents, executive officer.
<p>"If it weren't for our air pollution control program, we would have had several more days with very unhealthful air quality this spring."
<p>A Stage 1 episode is called when ozone levels reach 0.20 parts per million or 200 pollutant standards index (PSI).  At this very unhealthful level, everyone should avoid vigorous outdoor activity.  Anyone particularly sensitive to smog, including those with heart or lung disease, should stay indoors.
<p>A health advisory is called when ozone levels reach 0.15 ppm or 138 PSI.  At this level, healthy adults should avoid prolonged and vigorous outdoor exercise, and susceptible individuals should avoid outdoor activity.
<p>The potential for unhealthful smog levels has been heightened this spring due to the lack of an El Nino weather pattern, which tends to bring cooler temperatures that inhibit smog formation, AQMD meteorologists said.
<p>In addition, offshore sea temperatures have been at near-August levels, diminishing the marine layer, which also inhibits smog formation.
<p>Two other factors that will affect this summer's smog season:
 <ul><li>Cleaner-burning gasoline will significantly reduce emissions and have a positive effect on air quality.
 <li>An increase in the state's speed limit from 55 mph to 65 mph may also slightly increase smog-forming emissions.
</ul><p>"These significant variables make this year a hard one to predict," Lents said.
<p>
 <b>Higher smog on weekends</b>
<p>Air quality specialists have noticed a trend toward ozone levels reaching their peak on weekends.  This spring's Stage 1 episodes followed that pattern, occurring on Saturday, May 11, when ozone levels reached 0.24 ppm, and Sunday, May 12, when levels climbed to 0.21 ppm. AQMD plans further analysis of the trend later this year.
<p>
<b>Still nation's smoggiest</b>
<p>Air quality in the metropolitan Los Angeles area has dramatically improved -- days above the federal health standard for ozone dropped from 208 in 1977 to 98 last year.  However, the region still has by far the worst smog in the nation.


<p>From 1992 to 1994, the basin suffered an average of 103 days a year above the federal standard for ozone.  Houston, the next most polluted region outside California, had an average of 13 days, and New York City averaged four days.

<a name = "wood"></a><h3>Wood Product Coating Rule Revised </h3>

<p>Wood product makers in the region will bemore than half way to their emissions-reduction goal within one year under compromise amendments to Rule 1136 approved by the Board June.
<p>Between now and July 1, 1997, industry representative agreed to reduce daily emissions by five tons, more than the industry emissions have declined since 1988.  In exchange, the AQMD agreed to give the industry until 2005 to achieve their final reduction goal.
<p>The Board approved the rule amendments on a unanimous vote and hailed the compromise reached after lengthy negotiations with industry representatives.
<p>"This compromise is an excellent example of our new Board's efforts to strike a reasonable balance between our twin needs for clean air and a strong economy," said James M. Lents, executive officer.  
<p>"Our amendments will achieve substantial emissions reductions in the short-term and provide additional time and increased flexibility for our local businesses."
<p>AQMD worked closely with the industry in developing the amendments, including five meetings with a wood product makers working group, three with a group of wood coatings makers, a detailed survey of the industry and two public workshops.
<p>Since 1988, volatile organic compound emissions from these sources in our region went from 15 tons per day to 11 tons per day.  By July 1, 1997, the compromise amendments will cut those remaining emissions by 45%, to six tons per day.  In exchange, manufacturers in the region won more time to meet the final goal of two tons per day from July 1, 1996, to 2005.
<p>"These manufacturers are important to our economy," Lents said.  "We found that many could not use less polluting water-based coatings on their products now and still compete with manufacturers outside the region not subject to similar requirements."
<p>EPA recently removed acetone from the list of photochemically reactive compounds, which will allow coating makers to meet next year's standards.
<p>
The amendments also will:
<ul><li>Provide several additional choices for companies to comply with the limits;
<li>Increase flexibility when it comes to averaging emissions for compliance purposes; and
<li>Maintain exemptions for classic guitars, refinishing, touch-up and repair, and replacement and custom replica furniture.

<h4>Fine Particulate Pollution Causes 8,000 Deaths a Year, Study Says</h4>
<p>
Fine particulate pollution kills 8,800 people prematurely each year in the South Coast Air Basin, according to a study released this spring by the Natural Resources Defense Council.
<p>Nationwide, fine particulate may kill 64,000 people prematurely, according to the report, Breath Taking -- Premature Mortality Due to Particulate Air Pollution in 239 American Cities.
<p>NRDC estimated premature deaths for 239 cities based upon the measured particulate levels and risk factors developed in two separate studies: one in 1993 by Harvard University that followed more than 8,000 individuals in six cities for 14 to 16 years, and one in March 1995 by the American Cancer Society and Harvard University.
<p>Numerous  medical doctors and epidemiologists considered leading researchers in the field of air pollution and human health reviewed NRDC's study.
<p>NRDC estimated that 5,873 premature deaths a year occur due to fine particulate in the Los Angeles-Long Beach metropolitan statistical area, 1,905 in the Riverside-San Bernardino MSA, and 1,053 in the Anaheim-Santa Ana MSA.
<p>The Los Angeles-Long Beach area was ranked number one in the nation for premature deaths, Riverside-San Bernardino number six and Anaheim-Santa Ana number 12.
<p>The basin, which encompasses all those areas, is among the worst place in the nation for fine particle pollution, particularly the Inland Empire.
<p>Based upon the study, NRDC is recommending a substantial tightening of the federal health standard for fine particulate.
<p><i>Copies of the report are available for $10.50, plus $3.50 for shipping and handling, from NRDC Publications Department, 40 West 20th St., New York, NY 10011.  California residents should add 7.25% sales tax.</i><p>

<a name = "study"><h4>Particulate Study Results Due for Huntington Park Neighborhood</h4>
<p>
Residents of a Huntington Park neighborhood bordering several recycling facilities later this month will learn if levels of fine particles are a potential health problem.
<p>AQMD's special monitoring team has spent the last two months collecting particulate samples in the Cottage Street area adjacent to the plants.  The monitoring results are due later this month.
<p>The team put out plates to collect settling dust and used vacuum cleaner like equipment to collect fine dust out of the ambient air.  Sampling was conducted both upwind and downwind of the facilities to pinpoint, their contribution to dust in the area.
<p>At issue is Aggregate Recycling, which is recycling into construction material debris from the Northridge earthquake, and nearby facilities that recycle both glass and metal.
<p>Residents in the area have complained of dust from the facilities and the potential problem has been covered in several news reports.<p>

<h4>Incentive to Scrap Old, Dirty Lawn Mowers Adopted</h4>
<P><BR>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="mower.gif" ALT="Lawn Mower">
<FONT SIZE=2>
<BR><I>One two-stroke lawn mower emits as much <BR>
smog-forming volatile organic compound pollution <BR>
as 73 new cars driving at 30 mph, the average vehicle <BR>
speed in the Los Angeles metropolitan area.</I>
</FONT></CENTER>
<P><BR>

Homeowners could receive incentives to trade in old, highly polluting lawnmowers for zero-emission electric models under a voluntary program approved by AQMD's Governing Board.
<p>Rule 1623, adopted in May, allows businesses to earn emission reduction credits by voluntarily replacing high-emitting lawn and garden equipment with low- or zero-emitting models.
<p>"Some gasoline older lawn-mowers are bigger polluters than the family car," said James M. Lents, executive officer.  A dirty mower operated for 20 hours a year produces the same amount of smog-forming volatile organic compound pollution as a 1996 passenger car driven for 26,000 miles -- more than most people drive in a year, Lents said.
<p>"This program could help speed up the phase-out of old, dirty mowers and other polluting garden equipment," he said.
<p>
Businesses can earn emission reduction credits by offering rebates, discounts or other incentives to homeowners who trade in old, yet operable lawnmowers, edgers, trimmers, leaf blowers, chainsaws or other power garden equipment for new models that meet or exceed the California Air Resources Board's current emission standards. 
<p>The cleaner the replacement model, the more credits earned.  Firms also can earn a smaller increment of credits simply by selling clean gardening equipment to consumers.
<p>The credits -- issued in pounds per year for volatile organic compounds, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter -- will last up to seven years, depending on the average expected life of the equipment being replaced.
<p>Companies can purchase and use the credits to delay compliance with AQMD regulations; to meet emission reduction requirements under RECLAIM, the REgional CLean Air Incentives Market; or to offset emission increases at new or expanding facilities.
<p><i>- Sam Atwood</i>
<p><a name = "lawn"><h4>Lawn, Garden Equipment Add to Southland's Smog Problem</h4>
<p>An estimated 1.73 million commercial and residential mowers, blowers and other utility tools emit 22 tons per day of volatile organic compounds -- more than is belched out by all aircraft in the region.
In addition, lawn and garden equipment is responsible for 0.8 tons per day of nitrogen oxide emissions and 182 tons per day of carbon monoxide.
<p>
<b>Cleaner, quieter choices are available</b>
<p>To help reduce lawn and garden equipment pollution, CARB required 1995 and later models to meet low-emission standards.  A second, more stringent standard will apply to 1999 and later model years.
<p>Today's electric mowers can easily do the job without polluting at all.  Modern cordless-electric mowers powered by rechargeable batteries are lightweight, pack five horsepower and can mow up to half an acre per charge.  Electric mowers are only half as noisy as gas-powered models and don't require the hassle of fueling.
<p>"The average life of a lawnmower is seven years," said James M. Lents, executive officer.  "If businesses take advantage of this program, they could speed up the replacement of polluting mowers with more environmentally friendly equipment."

<h4>Solar Cell Roof Shingles to Power Homes in Compton</h4>
<p>
High-tech roof shingles made from solar cells will provide most of the electricity needed at 12 newly built Compton homes.
<p>This summer, the Compton Community Redevelopment Agency and the Nehemiah West Housing Corp. -- a non-profit coalition of more than 300 Southland church and community groups -- will build 49 two-story, suburban-style homes to help revitalize a Compton neighborhood.
<p>Instead of bolting add-on solar panels to rooftops after construction, shingles containing photovoltaic cells will form an integral part of the watertight roofs.  Photovoltaic cells, typically made from silicon crystals, directly convert sunlight to electricity.
<p>"This project will demonstrate the use of rooftop photovoltaic cells in a way that should be more reliable and aesthetic and possibly less costly than traditional solar panels," said James M. Lents, executive officer.
<p>It will be one of the first demonstrations of solar shingle technology on residential rooftops in this country.
<p>Building solar cells directly into roof shingles at a manufacturing plant will reduce installation costs and allow for greater quality control, Lents added.
<p>Photovoltaic roof shingles will generate roughly 60% of each home's total electric needs.  The balance of electricity needs will be provided by the region's conventional power grid.
<p>AQMD contributed $100,000 toward the project and the state's Petroleum Violation Escrow Account provided $200,000.
<p>If this project is successful, housing developers could offer solar-shingle roofs as an option on new homes, and the increased demand could reduce the cost of photovoltaics, making them more competitive with conventional utility power.
Homes with photovoltaic roofs could also generate power to recharge electric vehicles, providing a totally emission-free source of transportation.
<p>"Homeowners could save money in the long run with their own rooftop power plants," Lents said. 
<p>"They also could take pride in knowing that they are directly contributing to the fight against smog by relying on a pollution-free source of energy."

<p>
Say Sparkletts and Southern Californians think clean drinking water.  Now the company has taken on a refreshing new challenge -- exploring the use of a clean, renewable energy source -- electricity -- to power one of their 360 delivery trucks and, ultimately, help clean our skies.
<p>Logging over 200 stops and starts a day, water delivery trucks produce greater emissions than their daily 70 mile trip would indicate.  Trucks are a large source of nitrogen oxide emissions, are not subject to smog checks and lack catalytic conversion technology in use by cars.  Making just one water delivery truck electric will cut NOx, particulate and carbon monoxide emissions by over 1.6 tons per year. 
<p>The special 18-month, $377,000 demonstration program was proposed by McKesson Water Products, bottler of Sparkletts-brand water, in a cost-share partnership with AQMD's Technology Advancement Office.  It will show how battery-powered electric technology can turn heavy-duty delivery vehicles into zero polluters.
<p>Battery-powered buses, in trial operation in the United States for some time, not only eliminate regulated emissions, but are quiet and do not to create diesel smoke.  Heavy-duty electric trucks, however, have been slow to develop due to their unique requirements for power, load, duty cycle and range. 
<p>If six months of rigorous daily on-road use shows this electric truck technology can be a productive and efficient way to deliver water, McKesson intends to purchase up to 100 of these zero emissions delivery vehicles.

More than 300 minority business representatives attended a conference hosted by the AQMD last month to help them bid on agency procurement opportunities.
<p>"AQMD is making every effort to expand the amount of contracting we do with small businesses, women and minority-owned businesses, and disabled-veteran business enterprises," said Pomona City Council Member Nell Soto, who represents eastern cities in Los Angeles County on the AQMD Governing Board.  "We urge these companies to join us and explore future opportunities."
<p>Prospective vendors learned about AQMD contracting and how to navigate the bidding and proposal process from agency staff who are directly responsible for soliciting contracts.
<p>According to the AQMD's 1996-1997 budget, which began July 1, approximately $11.4 million will be spent on procurement of supplies, services and equipment.
<p>In addition, the AB 2766 Discretionary Fund, which is administered by the Mobile Source Air Pollution Reduction Review Committee, distributes $12 million annually to  local governments, agencies and private-sector businesses that compete for project funding.  AQMD staff provide administrative and contract support for the program.
<p>"The AQMD has a strong desire to enhance its contracting and procurement record and has a great deal of Board support for this effort," said Joe Contaoi, AQMD's director of administrative services and human resources .  
<p>"We wanted to host our own event so that staff in individual AQMD programs could discuss how to bid on upcoming professional and technical consulting service contracts and purchases of building, automotive and office supplies,"

<h4>EDBR Helps Firms Meet Their Goals</h4>
<p>
Businesses are using AQMD's Economic Development and Business Retention Office as a one-stop shop to resolve air quality issues when seeking to relocate or expand.
<p>EDBR works with trade orgaizations, utilities and other government agencies to help businesses stay and grow in Southern California and to attract new companies to the area.
<p>"We offer simplified advice and creative solutions," said Larry Watkins, manager in the office.  "By focusing on pollution prevention and abatement technology we allow existing businesses to remain competitive or expand into new product lines and help reduce or reverse business flight.
<p>"The results of the process are jobs, revenue, and long-term economic prosperity."
<p>EDBR has had a hand in retaining and creating some 23,000 jobs in the Southland.
<p>Sometimes companies just assume they cannot meet AQMD requirements based on hearsay, Watkins has found.
"In fact, most companies can meet the regulatory requirements when there is a clear direction as to how the requirements will be applied."
<p><i>For information on EDBR, call (909) 396-2660.</i>

<P><BLOCKQUOTE>Set Public Hearing September 13, 1996 to Amend Rule 1176</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<BR>Executive Officer
<P><font size=-2>PL:CC:MN:JC:DR:dr</font>
<HR><B>Background</B>
<P>The purpose of Rule 1176 - Sumps and Wastewater Separators, is to reduce VOC emissions from wastewater systems located at oil production fields, refineries, chemical plants, and industrial facilities engaged in the production and distribution of natural gas and petroleum products.  The rule originally was adopted on November 3, 1989 and subsequently amended twice, on January 5, 1990 and May 13, 1994, to address SIP changes.  
<P>VOC emissions are generated from wastewater systems whenever the surface of a liquid containing VOCs is exposed to the atmosphere.  Such emissions are generally a function of the VOC content in the liquid, flow rate of the liquid, drop height of the liquid, material temperature and vapor pressure, exposed area for evaporation, ambient temperature and wind conditions.  The proposed rule targets VOC emission sources in a wastewater system from process drains, and components associated with the sewer lines including junction boxes and manhole covers.
<P><B>Proposal</B>
<P>Based on staff&#146;s analysis of the proposed amendments, more than three tons per day of VOC emission reductions can be achieved at an overall estimated cost of less than $600 per ton of reduction using a combination of controls.  The cost estimates, depending on the selection of air pollution control equipment under worst case, could be as high as about $4,400 per ton of reduction.  However, staff believes that facilities will utilize the least costly control options, which achieve VOC emission reductions at an overall estimated cost of less than $600 per ton.  The emission reductions will result from control of drains and other wastewater system components.  
<P>In the proposed amendments refineries will be provided an option to either control repeat emitting drain system components with a combination of increased monitoring and controls, or to install controls on all drain system components.  Refineries are provided six months to begin implementation of either option, and have until the end of year 2000 to incrementally control all drains at a rate of 25% each year, if they choose the latter option.
<P>VOC emissions from the intermediate components of sewer lines connecting drain systems to wastewater separators, such as the junction boxes and manhole covers, will be required to be monitored and controlled, if necessary, for all facilities.  Facilities are provided six months to begin implementation of the monitoring requirements and up to six months after obtaining Permits to Construct if air pollution control equipment is necessary to control their emissions.
<P>The proposed amendments will also provide increased operational flexibility to facilities by reducing the monitoring and source test frequencies and by exempting specific, insignificant emission sources.  The monitoring frequency is adjusted to reduce the monitoring for low-emitting drain component systems from monthly to quarterly, while it will be increased from monthly to weekly for the fewer high-emitting ones.  The monitoring frequency will be reduced from monthly to semi-annually for drain system components equipped with controls.  This approach allows focusing resources on drain system components with higher potential to emit VOCs.
<P>The source test frequency for air pollution control equipment is also reduced from semi-annually to once a year and other less expensive compliance demonstration alternatives are provided in lieu of source testing.  Also, the exemption for bulk loading terminals is extended from those handling gasoline only to all others.  This exemption is not expected to result in any significant emission increases.
<P>In addition, review of the proposed amendments pursuant to CEQA have identified no significant adverse impacts.  Therefore, staff plans to recommend adoption of the proposed amendments to Rule 1176 to the AQMD Governing Board.
<P><B>Policy Issues</B>
<P>One of the major policy issues raised as a result of the proposed amendments relates to whether or not the existing uncontrolled drain system components, such as junction box vents and manhole cover openings, should be monitored and controlled.  Overall, the proposed amendments require monitoring and control, if necessary, of VOCs from all potential sources of emissions in wastewater systems.  Staff believes that since the wastewater system components are all interconnected, partial control of only certain drain system components would not only leave potentially significant VOC emission sources uncontrolled, but may indeed increase emissions from such uncontrolled sources.
<P>Since very little data was available on emissions from junction box vents and manhole cover openings, staff conducted a series of surveys, monitoring and source tests on such sources at all major refineries in 1996.  Based on the results of the surveys, staff has concluded that emissions from these sources are significant and emissions can be reduced cost effectively.  In addition, the original intent of the rule was to reduce VOC emissions from the entire wastewater system.  Therefore, staff has proposed to require monitoring and control, if necessary, of these sources.
<P>The other major policy issue relates to the level of monitoring and control required for sources with various emission potentials.  Staff has considered this issue and has recommended to shift industry resources for monitoring and control to wastewater system components with higher potential to emit VOCs.  Therefore, staff has proposed an option for refineries to more frequently monitor and control, if necessary, the repeat emitting sources.  In addition, staff has proposed to reduce monitoring frequency for low or non-emitting sources and exempt altogether certain other sources with insignificant emissions.
<P><B>CEQA &amp; Socioeconomic Analysis</B>
<P>Pursuant to CEQA, staff prepared a Draft Supplemental Environmental Assessment (SEA) for the proposed amendments to Rule 1176.  The Draft SEA does not identify any significant adverse environmental impacts from the proposed project and has been circulated for a 30-day public review and comment period ending July 29, 1996.  All comments received will be addressed and incorporated into the Final SEA for the proposed project.
<P>Potential impacts of the proposed amendments were analyzed using the AQMD&#146;s Socioeconomic REMI model (1993).  The analysis estimates that the employment impact resulting from the proposed amendments on average is about seven jobs forgone per year between 1997 and 2010.  This number could range to about 50 jobs forgone per year between 1997 and 2010 if the facilities choose the more expensive control option.
<P><B>Implementation Plan</B>
<P>The proposed amendments will require a certified inspector program to be implemented on or after July 1, 1997 or at a later date approved by the AQMD.  This inspectors&#146; certification program will be jointly implemented with the representatives of the affected industries once the proposed amendments are adopted.
<P><B>Resource Impacts</B>
<P>The proposed amendments will require development of a certified inspector program and additional monitoring by AQMD inspectors of junction box vents and manhole covers.  In the mean time, reduced workloads are expected by the proposed exclusion of bulk terminals from this rule.  Overall, minimal impact on AQMD resources is projected.

<P>
(Adopted August 1, 1975)(Amended February 5, 1988)
<H3>RULE 805. SCOPE OF ORDER </H3>


An order for abatement issued by the Hearing Board shall include
an order to comply with the statute or rule being violated. Such
order may provide for installation of control equipment and for
a schedule of completion and compliance. As an alternative to
an order to comply, the Hearing Board may order the shutdown of
any source of emissions which violates any statute or rule. An
order for abatement may also include a directive to take other
action determined appropriate to accomplish the necessary abatement.<BR>

<A NAME="r806"></A>
<P>
(Adopted August 1, 1975)(Amended February 5, 1988)
<H3>RULE 806. FINDINGS </H3>

<P>
(a) No order for abatement shall be granted unless the Hearing
Board makes all of the following findings:
<P>
<OL><LI>That the respondent is in violation of Section 41700 or 41701,
Health and Safety Code, or of any rule or regulation of the South
Coast Air Quality Management District Board.
<P>
<LI>That the order of abatement will not constitute a taking of
property without due process of law.
<P>
<LI>That if the order of abatement results in the closing or elimination
of an otherwise lawful business, such closing would not be without
a corresponding benefit in reducing air contaminants.
</OL>
<P>
(b) As an alternative to paragraph (a) above, the Hearing Board
may issue an order for abatement pursuant to the stipulation of
the Executive Officer and the person or persons accused of violating
Section 41700 or 41701, or any order, rule, or regulation prohibiting
the discharge of air contaminants into the air, upon the terms
and conditions set forth in the stipulation, without making the
findings required under paragraph (a), above. The Hearing Board
shall, however, include a written explanation of its action in
the order for abatement.<BR>

<A NAME="r807"></A>
<P>
(Adopted August 1, 1975)
<H3>RULE 807. PLEADINGS </H3>


Any person may file a written answer, other responsive pleading,
memorandum, or brief not less than five days before the hearing.
Said documents shall be served the same as petitions under Rule
803.

<P>
(Adopted August 1, 1975)(Amended February 5, 1988)
<H3>RULE 808. EVIDENCE </H3>

<P>
(a) Oral evidence shall be taken only on oath or affirmation.
<P>
(b) Each party shall have these rights: to call and examine witnesses;
to introduce exhibits; to cross-examine opposing witnesses on
any matter relevant to the issues even though that matter was
not covered in the direct examination; to impeach any witness
regardless of which party first called him to testify; and to
rebut the evidence against him. If respondent does not testify
in his own behalf, he may be called and examined as if under cross-examination.
<P>
(c) The hearing need not be conducted according to technical rules
relating to evidence and witnesses. Any relevant evidence shall
be admitted if it is the sort of evidence on which responsible
persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs,
regardless of the existence of any common law or statutory rule
which might make improper the admission of such evidence over
objection in civil actions. Hearsay evidence may be used for the
purpose of supplementing or explaining any direct evidence but
shall not be sufficient in itself to support a finding unless
it would be admissible over objection in civil actions. The rules
of privilege shall be effective to the same extent that they are
now, or hereafter may be, recognized in civil actions, and irrelevant
and unduly repetitious evidence shall be excluded.
<P>
(d) The Hearing Board shall allow interested members of the public
a reasonable opportunity to testify with regard to a matter under
consideration. Interested persons may attend and submit oral or
written statements (the original plus 8 copies) at the hearing;
however, it is desirable that written statements be submitted
to the Hearing Board five days before the hearing. Statements
need not conform to formal rules of evidence, nor with subsections
(a), (b), or (c) of this rule. The chairman may impose reasonable
limits on the duration of oral presentations.<BR>

a meeting of the Hearing Board. The chairman or any three members,
without a meeting, may require the petitioner to state further
facts or reframe a petition so as to disclose clearly the issues
involved.
