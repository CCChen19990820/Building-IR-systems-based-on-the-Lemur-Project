Instructions<br>
(Section references are to the Internal Revenue Code, unless otherwise stated.)
 <P>
Purpose of Form.  <br>
Use this form to tell the payer, middleman, broker or barter exchange that you are a nonresident alien or foreign entity that is not subject to certain US information return reporting or to backup withholding rules. 
 Payers of interest (including original issue discount), brokers, and barter exchanges may have to withhold 20% of each payment or transaction if, among other reasons, payees do not give the payer or broker their correct taxpayer identification number. This is referred to as backup withholding(The taxpayer identification number is a number assigned by the Social Security Administration or the IRS, for individuals, or an employer identification number assigned by IRS for other entities ) Also, the law requires that:  <br>
<UL>
<LI>  payments of interest;

<LI>  sales of securities, commodities, regulated futures contracts and forward contracts through a broker; and

<LI>  exchanges of property or services through a barter exchange must generally be reported to the Internal Revenue Service. 
</UL>

 <P>

Nonresident aliens (individuals who are neither citizens nor residents of the United States) and foreign partnerships, corporations, estates and trusts are not generally required to have a US taxpayer identification number, nor are they subject to any backup withholding because they do not furnish such a number to a payer or broker. Also, subject to a substantiation of foreign status, payments to these account holders are generally not subject to U S. reporting requirements.
 <P>
Interest Payments -- Bank interest paid to you is not subject to the withholding or reporting requirements if you are not a US citizen or resident, or if you are a foreign corporation, partnership, estate or trust. Use this form to notify the payer of your foreign status.
 <P>
Repeal of 30% Withholding on Portfolio Interest --  Generally, for publicly offered long term commercial obligations ("portfolio debt investments") issued after July 18, 1984, no withholding is required on interest paid to nonresident aliens or to foreign partnerships or corporations. For interest on registered obligations not targeted to foreign markets to qualify as portfolio interest and not be subject to 30% withholding, you must give the US payer a Form W-8. For interest on registered obligations targeted to foreign markets to qualify as portfolio interest and not be subject to 30% withholding. you must give the US payer a Form W-8 In some cases. Therefore, give the payer 2 Form W-8 if one is requested: For bearer obligations targeted to foreign markets, you need not give the payer a Form W-8. 
 <P>
Broker Transactions and Barter Exchanges. --You are exempt from U S. withholding and reporting requirement s and may use Form W-8 to notify the broker or barter exchange if you meet the following definition of an exempt foreign person for the calendar year In which the transaction occurs: 
 <P>
Individuals.--<br>
<UL>

<LI> You have not been present in the United! States for 183 days or more during the calendar year, and con t !an to be (or your country has a tax treat) with the United States that exempts your transactions from U S. taxes): and

<LI>  The gains from your transactions with the broker or barter exchange are not effectively connected (related) to any U S trade or business you are engaged in or plan to engage in during the year. or your country has a tax treaty with the United S a-.States that exempts your transactions from US taxes
</UL>


Nonresident Alien Married to a US S Citizen or Resident.--<br>

</UL>
 <P>


When to File -- File this certificate with the payer (or broker or barter exchange) in the calendar year in which the payment is made or collected (or for brokerage sails or barter exchanges the year the transaction took place), unless you have already done this in either of the two preceding calendar years.

                        or principal office of any fiduciary.<p>
</dl></dl>


 <P>
Notice of Change in Status -- If you  become a U S. citizen or resident after you have filed Form W-8, or if you cease to be an "exempt foreign person," you must notify  the payer within 30 days of your change in
status. To notify the payer, you may check the box in Part 11 of this form, or use the method prescribed by the payer. Reporting will then begin on the account(s) listed, and backup withholding may also begin unless you certify to the payer that (1) the taxpayer identification number you have given is correct, and (2) he internal Revenue Service has not notified you that you are subject to backup withholding because you ailed to report certain interest or dividend income. You may use Form W-9, Payer's Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification, to make these certifications.
 <P>
If an account is no longer active you do not have to notify a payer or broker of your change in status unless you also have another account with the same payer that is still active.
 <P>
If you file a false certificate when you are not entitled to the exemption from withholding or reporting you may be subject to penalties and/or imprisonment under US perjury laws. 
 <P>
More Than One Payer -- If you receive interest from more than one payer or have dealings with ore than one broker or barter exchange, file a certificate with each. 
 <P>
More Than One Account With the Same Payer -- If you have more than one account with the same payer (for example savings account and a certificate of deposit at the same bank), the payer may require you to file a separate certificate for each account. 
 <P>
How Often you Must File -- This certificate generally remains in effect for three calendar years. A payer, broker, or barter exchange. however, may require that a new certificate be filed-each time a payment is made. 
 <P>
Signature -- On joint accounts in which each joint-owner is a foreign person each must provide a Form W-8.

determine at any time
that, for any of the following reasons, Subscriber does not qualify as a Nonprofessional

<dl>
<dt>(i)Vendor made an erroneous initial determination regarding Subscriber's qualification,<p>
<dt>(ii) Vendor or NYSE discovered a misrepresentation herein,<p>
<dt>(iii) Subscriber failed to furnish all material information, or<p>
<dt>(iv) Subscriber failed to update information contained herein.<p>

deny Subscriber the opportunity to enter into such agreement(s) if his/her failure to

breach of the Application and Agreement.<p>

<dt>(b)RETROACTIVE PAYMENT -- In the event that such a determination is based upon any
of clauses (ii) through (iv) of Paragraph 7(a), or upon a violation of Paragraph 5,

determination, (ii) of the period, as determined by NYSE, during which

or more Subscriber-procured interrogation devices, Subscriber, unless otherwise
directed in writing by Vendor, (a) shall report to Vendor, both at the commencement
of such receipt and upon Vendor's request, the number and type(s) of such devices,
and (b) shall promptly report to Vendor any change in the number of type(s) of such

copyright or violates any other property right.<p>

Application and Agreement. <p>

<dt>10.STRICT COMPLIANCE REQUIRED -- Subscriber understands that he/she must comply strictly
with the provisions of this Application and Agreement in order to continue to receive

this Application and Agreement and discontinue providing Information to Subscriber.<p>

<dt>11.DATA NOT GUARANTEED -- Subscriber understands that neither the Participants nor 
the "Processor" of "CTA" (as defined in the CTA Plan) guarantees the timeliness, 
sequence, accuracy or completeness of Information.  Neither Subscriber nor any other
person shall hold any of them liable in any way for <br>
<dl>
<dt>(a) any inaccuracies or errors in, or omissions of, any such information or message,<p>
<dt>(b) any delays or errors in the transmission or delivery of any part of any such
information or message, or<p>
<dt>(c) any loss or damage arising from or occasioned by any such inaccuracies, errors,
omissions or delays or by reason of non-performance, or of interruption in any such
information or message,<br>
</dl>
either due to any negligent act or omission by any of them or due to any cause beyond
the reasonable control of any of them, including, but not limited to, flood, 
extraordinary weather conditions or other act of God, fire, war, insurrection, riot,
strike, accident, action of government, communications or power failure, or equipment
or software malfunction.  <p>
<dt>12.DATA MODIFICATION OR DISCONTINUANCE -- Subscriber understands that the participants
do not guarantee that they will continue to disseminate, or that they will not
change or eliminate any of the methods by which they disseminate, Information.  If the
Participants discontinue disseminating Information or change or eliminate any such
method, Subscriber shall not hold the Participants liable in any way for any loss or
damage arising therefrom.<p>

<dt>13.PARTICIPANTS' ENFORCEMENT RIGHT -- The Participants may enforce this Application
and Agreement against Subscriber by legal proceedings or other appropriate means.<p>

<dt>14.PARTICIPANTS' SUBSTITUTED ADMINISTRATION -- Subscriber understands that NYSE may, 
by written notice, direct Subscriber to send any payments, information or 
notifications provided for herein to NYSE and, if Subscriber receives B Information,
to AMEX, as appropriate.  Such direction shall specify whether such obligation is
in lieu of, or in addition to, Subscriber's obligation to send any such item to Vendor.
Subscriber shall comply with any such direction.<p>

Service and of Subscriber's use of the Information, all at
reasonable times, upon reasonable notice, to ensure compliance with
this Agreement.
 <P>
8.   To extent permitted by applicable law, Subscriber acknowledges
and agrees that the termination of the Vendor's Service for failure
to make payments shall not be deemed or considered  to be, and
Subscriber waives any right to represent or assert that any such
exercise constitutes, an act or ommission or an improper denial or
limitation of access by Nasdaq to any service or facility operated
by Nasdaq as contemplated in Section 11A of the Exchange Act, or
any other provision of the Exchange Act, or any rule, regulation,
or interpretation adopted thereunder.

where directed by NASD in its regulatory authority, Nasdaq may
terminate this Agreement on not less than three (3) days written
notice to Subscriber provided either by Nasdaq or Vendor.
 <P>
18. Nasdaq does not endorse or approve any equipment, Vendor, or

power, or privilege under this Agreement. If any of the provisions
of this Agreement, or application thereof to any Person or
circumstance, shall to any extent be held invalid or unenforceable,

	If you have comments concerning the accuracy of these time estimates or suggestions for making this form simpler, we would be happy to hear from you.  You can write to the Internal Revenue Service, Attention:  Tax Forms Committee, PC:FP, Washington, DC 20224.<P>
	DO NOT file this form with the IRS.  Instead, file it with the withholding agent.<P>

<B>Purpose of Form</B><BR>
	Beneficial owners of certain types of income (or owners' trustees or agents) use this form to report to a withholding agent both the ownership of the income and the reduced rate of tax or exemption from tax on the income under tax conventions or treaties.  The form can also be used to claim a release of tax withheld at source.<P>

<B>Instructions for Owners, Trustees, or Agents</B><BR>
<B>Who Must File</B>.-You must file Form 1001 if you are the beneficial owner of income subject to withholding under section 1441, 1442, or 1451 (or you are the trustee or agent of the beneficial owner) and the owner is a nonresident alien individual or fiduciary, or a foreign corporation or other foreign entity.<P>
	The term "beneficial owner" means the person ultimately entitled to control the income.  A nominee or any person acting in a similar capacity is not the beneficial owner.<P>
<B>Who Does Not Have To File.</B>-You do not have to file this form if you are:<BR>
	1.  A beneficial owner, trustee, or agent who receives only dividends, except as provided below. (The withholding agent may generally rely on an owner's address of record as the basis for allowing the benefit of any income tax treaty to the dividends being paid to the owner.)<P>
	However, a foreign corporation that receives dividends from another foreign corporation that are treated as income from sources within the United States under section 861(a)(2)(B) must file Form 1001 unless the dividends are exempt from tax under section 884(e)(3) (relating to earnings and profits subject to the branch profits tax).<P>
	2.  A beneficial owner, trustee, or agent who receives only income other than coupon bond interest and who does not claim the benefit of an income tax treaty.<P>
	3.  A nonresident alien individual or fiduciary, foreign partnership, or foreign corporation engaged in a trade or business in the United States during the tax year if the income is (a) effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by the individual, fiduciary, partnership, or corporation, and (b) exempt from withholding under section 1441 or 1442 because of Regulations section 1.1441-4(a). (In this case, file Form 4224, Exemption from Withholding of Tax on Income Effectively Connected With the Conduct of a Trade or Business in the United States.)<P>
	4.  A nonresident alien individual who claims exemption from withholding on compensation for independent personal services based on a U.S. tax treaty or the personal exemption amount. (File Form 8233, Exemption from Withholding on Compensation for Independent Personal Services of a Nonresident Alien Individual.)<P>
	5.  A nonresident alien individual or fiduciary, a foreign corporation, or a foreign partnership made up entirely of nonresident alien individuals and foreign corporations, if the interest is exempt from withholding under section 1441 or 1442 because of section 1441(c)(9) or (10).<P>
	6.  A foreign partnership or foreign corporation engaged in a trade or business in the United States during the tax year if the income is exempt from withholding under section 1441 or 1442 because of Regulations section 1.1441-4(f).<P>
<B>Where and When to File</B>.-File this form with the withholding agent.  When you file depends on the type of income to which Form 1001 applies, as specified in the boxes in item 1:<P>
	<B>Box 1b</B>.-For interest on coupon bonds, including tax-free convenient bonds, file the form each time you present a coupon for payment. (Use a separate Form 1001 for each issue of bonds.)<P>
	<B>All other item 1 boxes.</B>-For all other types of income, file the form as soon as you can for any successive 3-calendar-year period which you expect to receive this income.  Use a separate Form 1001 for each type of income, except for income received from a trust, estate, or investment account (box 1a).  For that type of income, use a separate Form 1001 for each different trust, estate, or investment account.<P>
	If after filing a form you become ineligible for the benefits of the tax treaty for the income, notify the withholding agent in writing.  If the beneficial ownership of the income changes hands, exempt rate of tax under the treaty only if entitled to it.  In additions, the new beneficial owner must properly file Form 1001 with the withholding agent.<P>

<H3>Specific Instructions</H3>
<B>Address.</B>-Enter your address in the space provided.  For and individual, your address is you permanent place of residence.  For partnerships or corporations, the address is the principal office or place of business.  For estates and trusts, the address is the permanent residence or principal office of the fiduciary.<P>
<B>Note: </B> To qualify for treaty benefits, a taxpayer must be a resident of a treaty country. (In some cases, a corporate taxpayer must also be a "qualified resident."  See the instructions for line 5.)  The withholding agent may presume that the beneficial owner of the income is not a resident (or qualified resident) of a treaty country, and is not entitled to treaty benefits, if the owner does not have a resident address in that country.  The beneficial owner of the income may demonstrate that he or she was a resident (or qualified resident) of the treaty country and was entitled to treaty benefits.<P>
<B>Line 2g-Rate of tax</B>.-Get Pub. 901, U.S. Tax Treaties, for the applicable rate, if any, to enter on line 2g.  If the interest is exempt from tax, write "None."<P>
<B>Line 3</B>-If you checked any box on line 1 other than box b, enter the years for which the reduced rate of tax or exemption from tax applies.<P>
<B>Line 4-Withheld tax requested to be released.</B>-If you use this form to claim a release of tax withheld at source, enter the amount claimed on line 4.  In the space to the left of the dollar entry space on line 4, identify the income tax treaty and the rate of tax for items 1a and 1c through 1I.<P>
	The release is only available prior to the filing of Form 1042, Annual Withholding Tax Return for U.S. Source of Income of Foreign Persons, for the calendar year by the withholding agent (Regulations section 1.1461-4).<P>
<B>Line 5-Qualified resident status.-</B>This line applies only to a corporation that claims treaty benefits for dividends paid to it by a U.S. trade or business of another foreign corporation.  To obtain treaty benefits for these payments, the recipient corporation must generally be a "qualified resident" of a treaty country to meet the requirements of a limitation on benefits article that entered into force after 1986.  (See section 884 and its regulations for the definition of interest paid by a U.S. trade or business, and other applicable rules.)  In general, a foreign corporation is a qualified resident of a country if any of the following applies: (a) it meets a 50% ownership and base erosion test, (b) it is primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market in its country of residence or the United States, (c) it carries on an active trade or business in its country of residence, or (d) it obtains a ruling from the IRS that it is a qualified resident.  See Regulations section 1.884-5 for the requirements that must be met to satisfy each of these tests.  Complete this line by indicating which of these tests has been met (if you claim qualified resident status) or that you meet the requirements of a limitation on benefits article that entered into force after 1986.<P>
<B>Instructions for Withholding Agent</B><BR>
	As a withholding agent, you are not required to send Form 1001 to the IRS.  Instead, use Form 1001 to prepare magnetic tape or paper document <B>Form 1042-S</B>, Foreign Person's U.S. Source Income Subject to Withholding.  Keep Form 1001 for at least 4 years after the end of the last calendar year in which the income to which the form pertains is paid.  Prepare a Form 1042-S for each separate payment during the calendar year of any item of income (including coupon bond interest).  If you receive more than one Form 1001 for an owner during the calendar year, prepare only one Form 1042-S to show the total amount of any item paid to the owner for that year.<P>

<P>
I hereby attest that the financial information submitted to you on my most recent account application is a true and correct representation of my financial position, and should there be a material change in any financial information contained therein, I will promptly give written notification to Howe Barnes Investments, Inc. of such change.

I will not enter an order for an option contract traded either on a national exchange or in the over-the-counter markets until after I have received and fully read the current disclosure document of The Options Clearing Corporation warning me of the duties, responsibilities and risks associated with options trading.  I understand that I must comply with any applicable duties and responsibilities set forth in the disclosure document.  I acknowledge that, upon request, Howe Barnes Investments, Inc. will supply me with a current copy of The Options Clearing Corporation prospectus.  I understand that transactions in options are of a short term nature and can entail a high degree of risk of financial loss.  I understand and agree to be bound by all rules and regulations applicable to option transactions as promulgated by all national securities exchanges and associations and The Options Clearing Corporation (or any clearing corporation that is associated with any national securities exchange, association and/or marketplace).  I realize that I will be charged a commission on an agency basis or a price mark-up or mark-down on a principal basis each time a trade is effected and I am fully prepared financially to undertake the risks inherent in options transactions and to withstand any losses created thereby.<P>

I further understand that all orders shall be executed and cleared, and that the account shall be handled, in accordance with the rules and regulations of all national securities exchanges and associations, and The Options Clearing Corporation (or any clearing corporation associated with any national securities exchange, association or marketplace).  I agree that I will not, acting alone or in concert with others, violate any option position limits, exercise limits or any other limits established by Howe Barnes Investments, Inc., any clearing corporation, national securities exchange, association, and/or marketplace.  I further understand that it may be necessary to report my position in a class or classes of options having the same underlying security and/or other underlying instrument(s) to the proper regulatory authority, indicating the account name, address and social security number (or tax identification number).  Therefore, in order that I do not violate, acting alone or in concert with others, any of the aforementioned option position or exercise limits, I agree to inform Howe Barnes Investments, Inc. of any option positions on the same side of the market and on the same underlying securities and/or other underlying instrument(s) which are held at firms other than Howe Barnes Investments, Inc.<P>

I agree that I am responsible for making all final decisions as to transactions effected in my option account and understand that each order through which I enter an option transaction must be complete in all respects.  If for any reason I feel that this policy is not being adhered to in any manner, I agree to promptly contact the management of Howe Barnes Investments, Inc. to discuss my account.  I understand that all payments due from me for the purchase of an option shall be paid not later than the end of the business day of trade date.<P>

In the event I do not satisfy on a timely basis, your money or collateral calls, Howe Barnes Investments, Inc. is authorized in its sole discretion and without notification to me, in compliance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Reserve, and any other regulatory body, to take any and all steps it deems necessary to protect itself (for any reason) in connection with options transactions for my account, including the right to buy and/or sell short, or short exempt for my account and risk any part or all of the securities and/or other underlying instrument(s) represented by options handled, purchased and/or endorsed by Howe Barnes Investments, Inc. for my account, or to buy for my account and risk any option that is deemed necessary or appropriate.  The failure of Howe Barnes Investments, Inc. to take such steps shall not be deemed acquiescence in my failure to satisfy money or collateral calls and shall not preclude you from subsequently following the steps set forth above.  I further agree that any and all expenses or losses incurred as a result of actions taken above, will be handled by Howe Barnes Investments, Inc. in the same manner as my general securities transactions under the "Brokerage Services Account Agreement" which I have signed with you and is incorporated by reference herein.<P>

I understand that I will bear full responsibility for taking action to exercise a valuable option.  Subject to any regulatory limits on exercise, I understand that Howe Barnes Investments, Inc. will accept my exercise instructions on normal business days prior to 2:00 P.M. Central Time, provided, however, on the business day immediately preceding the expiration date, I may submit instructions no later than 4:00 P.M. Central Time.  In the absence of my notifying Howe Barnes Investments, Inc. to exercise a valuable option contract prior to the expiration date, I understand that Howe Barnes Investments, Inc. will use its best efforts to exercise the option contract on my behalf and that I will be given an opportunity to retain the underlying securities and/or other underlying instrument(s).  I understand I will be charged a commission on an agency basis or a price mark-up or mark-down on a principal basis for this service in the event I retain the underlying securities and/or other underlying instrument(s).  If I do not notify Howe Barnes Investments, Inc. to exercise a valuable option prior to the expiration date and Howe Barnes Investments, Inc. for whatever reason is unable to exercise such option on my behalf, I hereby agree to waive any and all claims for damage or loss which I might have at that time or any time thereafter against Howe Barnes Investments, Inc. arising out of the fact that the option was not exercised.<P>

If I write a call option contract (uncovered or naked) without depositing the underlying security and/or other underlying instrument(s), I realize that my risk of loss is potentially unlimited.  Notwithstanding this risk of loss I agree to honor all assignments and deliver the underlying security and/or underlying instrument(s) in the proper time, I designate Howe Barnes Investments, Inc. to act as my agent and buy in such security and/or other underlying instrument(s) at the current market price so that I may honor my commitment to deliver.  If I write a put option contract, I realize I will be required to purchase the underlying securities and/or other underlying instrument(s) at the exercise price in the event I have received notice of assignment.  I agree to honor all assignments and pay the exercise price in the prescribed time to Howe Barnes Investments, Inc. and if I fail to make such payment in the proper time, I designate Howe Barnes Investments, Inc. to act as my agent and liquidate the underlying securities and/or other underlying instrument(s) at the market price so that I may honor my commitment.  I also understand that my account will be debited for any loss and that Howe Barnes Investments, Inc. will charge me a commission on an agency basis or a price mark-up or mark-down on a principal basis for these services; I agree to immediately pay all losses involved to Howe Barnes Investments, Inc. upon request.<P>

In order to induce you to effect transactions in Options for my account as I may request from time to time in order to provide you with reasonable grounds for believing that such transactions for my account are not unsuitable for me in light of my experience and knowledge and my investment objectives, financial situation and needs, I have furnished to you accurate information concerning my experience and knowledge and my investment objectives, financial situation and needs, I shall promptly so inform you in writing, Registered Mail postage prepaid, Attention: Compliance Department, and furnish to you such information with respect thereto as you may reasonably request.  If no corrections in writing are submitted to Howe Barnes Investments, Inc., all information herein will be deemed correct.<P>

Exercise Notification:  Howe Barnes Investments, Inc. utilizes a random method of allocation--exercise assignment notices for option contracts are allocated among customer short positions pursuant to a procedure which randomly selects from among all customer short option positions, including positions established on the day of the assignment, those contracts which are subject to exercise.  All short option positions are liable for assignment at any time.  A more detailed description of our random allocation procedure is available upon request.<P>

The provisions of this Agreement shall be considered as supplementary to the Brokerage Services Account Agreement which I have signed or may be asked to sign.  Except as specifically amended by this Agreement, all of the terms and conditions thereof shall remain effective with respect to all open commitments in Options now carried for my account as well as those hereafter made.  I understand that this Agreement cannot be amended without your prior written consent thereto.<P>

THIS AGREEMENT SHALL INURE TO THE BENEFIT OF HOWE BARNES INVESTMENTS, INC.'S PRESENT ORGANIZATION, AND ANY SUCCESSOR ORGANIZATION OR ASSIGNS, AND SHALL BE BINDING UPON ME AND/OR MY ESTATE, HEIRS EXECUTORS, ADMINISTRATORS, SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.<P>

I understand that the representations which I have made to you in connection with this Options Agreement will be relied upon by you and that the signing of this Agreement carries with it certain legal rights, duties and responsibilities.  Further, I understand that options trading carries certain Federal Income Tax consequences and that I should consult my own professional tax advisor for advice regarding opinions, laws, regulations, rules, decisions and policies of the IRS which are subject to change from time to time.

Information to any other person.<p>
<dt>        6. DATA RECEIPT COSTS - Subscriber shall not hold the Participants responsible for any costs associated with the Subscriber's receipt of Information
from Vendor.<p>
<dt>        7. FAILURE TO QUALIFY
<dl>
<dt>           (a) DETERMINATION - Subscriber understands that Vendor or NYSE
may determine at any time that, for any of the following reasons, Subscriber
does not qualify as a Nonprofessional Subscriber:
<dl>
<dt>(i)Vendor made an erroneous initial determination regarding 
Subscriber's qualification,<p>
<dt>(ii)Vendor or NYSE discovered a misrepresentation herein,<p>
<dt>(iii)Subscriber failed to furnish all material information, or<p>

<dt>(iv)Subscriber failed to update information contained herein.
</dl>

<dt>Subscriber understands that following such a determination he/she may continue
to receive Information only after entering into one or more appropriate
agreements directly with the appropriate network's administrator(s).  The
Participants may deny Subscriber the opportunity to enter into such 
agreements(s) if his/her failure to qualify results from willful misrepresentations
or omissions or from willful breach of this Application and Agreement. 
<p>

<dt>(b)RETROACTIVE RAYMENT -- In the event that such a determination is based 
upon any of clauses (ii) through (iv) of Paragraph 7(a), or upon a
violation during which Subscriber received such network's Information but 
did not qualify as a Nonprofessional Subscriber and (iii) of the amount,
calculated at Professional Subscriber rates, applicable to such period.
Within 30 days of receipt of such notice, Subscriber shall pay such amount
to such network's administrator at the address specified in Paragraph 17.
Subscriber has been informed by Vendor of the rates (both professional 
and nonprofessional) in effect at the time of Subscriber's execution of this
Application and Agreement.  Subscriber understands that if, pursuant to an
agreement between Vendor and the Participants or otherwise, Vendor pays to
NYSE any amount payable by Subscriber pursuant to this Paragraph 7(b),
Vendor shall become subrogated to any and all rights of the Participants to 
recover such amount from Subscriber.<p>
</dl>
</dl>

<dt>8.SUBSCRIBER-PROCURED EQUIPMENT -- If Subscriber receives Information by means
of one or more Subscriber-procured interrogation devices, Subscriber, unless 
otherwise directed in writing by Vendor, (a) shall report to Vendor, both
at the commencement of such receipt and upon Vendor's request, the number and
type(s) of such devices, and (b) shall promptly report to Vendor any change
in the number or type(s) of such devices.  Subscriber hereby indemnifies the
Participants for any costs arising out of any claim that any 
Subscriber-procured interrogation device of the manner in which such device uses 
Information provided pursuant hereto infringes any patent or copyright
or violates any other property right.<p>

<dt>9.SUBSCRIBER REQUIRED TO UPDATE -- Subscriber shall notify Vendor promptly
in writing of any change in his/her circumstances that causes any of his/her
statements or representations contained in either Part I or Part II to be in 
any way inaccurate or incomplete or that otherwise prevents him/her from
continuing to comply with this Application and Agreement.<p>

<dt>10. STRICT COMPLIANCE REQUIRED -- Subscriber understands that he/she must
comply strictly with the provisions of this Application and Agreement in
order to continue to receive Information as a nonprofessional subscriber.  
Subscriber also understands that if, in NYSE's judgment, any breach of this
Application and Agreement by Subscriber has occurred or any representation by 
Subscriber set forth in this Application and Agreement has been or is untrue,
Vendor shall, if and as directed by NYSE, terminate this Application and
Agreement and discontinue providing Information to Subscriber.<p>

<dt>11. DATA NOT GUARANTEED -- Subscriber understands that neither the 
Participants, the "Processor" nor the "Operating Committee" (as those
terms are defined in the CQ Plan) guarantees the timeliness, sequence,
accuracy or completeness of Information.  Neither Subscriber nor any
other person shall hold any of them liable in any way for<p>
<dl>
<dt>(a) any inaccuracies or errors in, or omissions of, any such information or
message, 
<p>

<dt>(b)any delays or errors in the transmission or delivery of any part of any
such information or message, or<p>
<dt>(c) any loss or damage arising from or occasioned by any such inaccuracies,
errors, omissions or delays or by reason of non-performance, or of 
interruption in any such information or message,<br>
 either due to any 
negligent act or omission by any of them or due to any cause beyond the 
reasonable control of any of them, including, but not limited to, flood,
extraordinary weather conditions or other act of God, fire, war, insurrection,
riot, strike, accident, action of government, communications or power failure,
or equipment or software malfunction.<p>
</dl>

<dt>12.DATA MODIFICATION OR DISCONTINUANCE --  Subscriber understands that the 
Participants do not guarantee that they will continue to disseminate,
or that they will not change or eliminate any of the methods by which they
disseminate, Information.  If the Participants discontinue disseminating
Information or change or eliminate any such method, Subscriber shall not
hold the Participants liable in any way for any loss or damage arising 
therefrom.<p>

<dt>13.PARTICIPANTS' ENFORCEMENT RIGHT -- The Participants may enforce this 
Application and Agreement, by legal proceedings or other appropriate
means, against Subscriber.<p>

<dt>14.PARTICIPANTS' SUBSTITUTED ADMINISTRATION -- Subscriber understands that
NYSE may, by written notice, direct Subscriber to send any payments,
information or notifications provided for herein to NYSE and, if Subscriber
receives B Information, to AMEX, as appropriate.  Such direction shall
specify whether such obligation is in lieu of, or in addition to,
Subscriber's obligation to send any such item to Vendor.  Subscriber shall
comply with any such direction.<p>

<dt>15.TERMINATION -- Upon becoming effective, this Application and Agreement
shall supersede all agreements (if any) between Subscriber either network's
administrator relating to Subscriber's receipt of Information through an
interrogation service.  Subject to Paragraphs 7, 10 and 12, either
Subscriber or Vendor may terminate this Application and Agreement on not less 
than 30 days' written notice to the other.  Paragraphs 7(b), 8
(second sentence only), 11 and 13 shall survive any termination of this
Agreement.<p>

<dt>16.GOVERNING LAW -- This Application and Agreement shall be governed
 by, and
interpreted in accordance with, the laws of the state of New York.<p>

<dt>17.NOTICES -- Any communications to the Participants, NYSE, AMEX, Vendor
or Subscriber provided for in, or otherwise relating to, this Application and
Agreement shall be sent to such person's below-indicated address:

<b><font size=+1>What are Personal Trust Services?</font></b><br>

<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>

To ensure your assets are distributed according to your personal wishes, you need to prepare a Will and appoint an executor.  You may want to set up a trust in your lifetime and appoint a trustee to manage it.  You may require ongoing investment assistance and advice, or help with your tax planning and filing.  Investment management and record keeping, estate and will planning and estate and trust administration -- these are all personal trust services offered across Canada by Scotiatrust.<p>

<a name="will"></a>

<b><font size=+1>Will & Estate Planning</font></b><br>

<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>

Disposition of the assets you have assembled through your lifetime requires careful consideration and knowledge and detailed direction through an Estate Plan and Will.  After all, having your estate settled without your intentions defined in a Will means an administrator will be appointed by the courts.  Your assets will then be administered according to provincial laws regardless of your wishes.<p>

That's why most of our clients begin a long-term relationship with Scotiatrust through Will & Estate Planning which will provide for the preservation of your assets and help protect your family's future.<p>

Each Will & Estate Plan is as unique as each client.  But every Estate Plan begins with a Scotiatrust professional gaining an understanding of your personal goals for the future and information about the intended beneficiaries' personal and financial situations, and your plans for them.  We then consider the effects of taxation and other Canadian federal and provincial laws, and begin the work of formulating a plan to meet your wishes.  When the plan has been agreed with, you and your lawyer can draft your Will to assure your intentions are clear.<p>

<b><font size=+1>Trustee & Executor Services</font></b><br>

<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>

The administration of an estate has become increasingly complicated and time consuming and requires a great deal of skill and impartiality.  Which is why many clients name Scotiatrust as executor and trustee of their estate.<p>

With Scotiatrust as executor, you can be assured that your wishes are carried out exactly as set out in your Will and that all details, no matter how complex, are handled thoroughly and with the kind of sensitivity that is required in sometimes difficult family situations.<p>

In certain circumstances, it may be beneficial for a client to set up a trust during their lifetime for the management of such assets as private companies or real estate, with distribution of the trust deferred until a future date.  When Scotiatust is appointed as a trustee, we ensure that the terms of the trust are carried out in a professional manner.<p>

Our specialists in estate administration, tax and investment planning can also provide valuable support by acting as agent to individuals who have been given the responsibility of acting as an executor or trustee.<p>

Whether you require full management of your investments or administrative support to help you keep pace with the detailed paperwork required in today's market, Scotiatrust professionals have the expertise, experience and resources to help you achieve your personal investment goals.<p>

Tax deductible fees at competitive rates give you a dedicated account manager supported by a team of specialists who will provide regular reporting, consultation when required, full administrative support, record keeping, and access to global markets.  Canadian tax services are also available at competitive rates.  Scotiatrust clients will attest to the fact that we have a tradition of bringing a very personal and professional attitude to personal trust services.<p>

<b>What it Costs...</b><br>

some cases less than) the service charge for writing a cheque or making a withdrawal. 

There is no INTERAC fee.  Ask your Scotiabank representative for details.<p>

<FONT SIZE = +2><B>BANKSPEAK - A GLOSSARY OF TERMS<!--HEADING--></B></FONT><BR>

<img VSPACE=5 src="line.gif">

</CENTER><p>



Banking, like a lot of professions, has its own vocabulary-words and short-forms used to describe money-related activities. The following terms are an introduction to the lexicon of banking.<p>



<a name="ABM">

<B>ABM</B> - Automated banking machine.<p>



<a name="amortization">

<B>Amortization</B> - When applied to a loan, the period over which the principal and interest are repaid.<p>



<a name="annualfee ">

<B>Annual fee</B> - The administration fee charged each year on a credit card account.<P>



<a name="assets">

<B>Assets</B> - Your possessions, including property, cash and investments.<p>



<a name="bankrupt">

<B>Bankrupt</B> - Technically this means being insolvent, or declared by law as unable to pay debts.  The result of declaring bankruptcy is that you may be prevented from obtaining credit for a car, credit card, home or a student loan for at least 7 years by financial institutions.<P>



<a name="classa">

<B>Class A loan</B> - A student loan that's active while a student is enrolled at school or during the grace period after graduation.<P>



<a name="classb">

<B>Class B loan</B> - A student loan that's being repaid after the student has graduated, or is being repaid while the student is enrolled part-time.<P>



<a name="collateral">

<B>Collateral</B> - Assets-usually property or investments- used to secure a loan.<P>



<a name="consolidation">

<B>Consolidation</B> - Combining more than one debt into a single loan.<P>



<a name="cosigner">

<B>Co-signer</B> - Person who signs a loan with you and shares responsibility for repayment of the loan.<P>



<a name="credrating ">

<B>Credit rating</B> - A rating created by authorized credit agencies that denotes a person's credit history.<P>



<a name="credbur">

<B>Credit Bureau report</B> - A confidential record of an individual's lending and repayment history. Credit Bureau reports will be requested on all applicants for a Scotia Student Loan and Scotiabank Classic VISA card.<P>



<B>Daily interest</B> - The interest calculated on a minimum or average daily account balances; usually credited to the account once a month.<P>



<B>Deficit</B> - The result of expenditures being greater than income (opposite of surplus).<P>



<B>Direct debit</B> - A means of paying for goods and services with a magnetic debit card that authorizes transfer of the funds, via the <I>INTERAC</I>&#174; Direct Payment network, directly from your account to the merchant's account.<P>



<B>Equity</B> - The value of property beyond what may be owed on the property. Thus, a house may be worth $250,000 with an outstanding mortgage of $100,000, creating equity of $150,000.<P>



<B>Fixed interest rate</B> - An interest rate that is established at the beginning of a loan and will continue unchanged for the term of the loan.<P>



<B>Floating interest rate</B> - An interest rate that is allowed to change during the term of a loan; usually pegged to the institution's prime rate.<P>



<B>GIC</B> - Guaranteed investment certificate; a savings instrument that pays a fixed rate of interest over a specified term.<P>



<B>Guarantor</B> - A person who guarantees to repay a loan in the event that the borrower defaults.<P>



<B><I>INTERAC</I>&#174; Network</B> - A network that links the ABMs of banks and other financial institutions in Canada.  It allows you to access your accounts using other participating banks' ABMs.<P>



<B>Lien</B> - A claim on a person's property as security for an unpaid debt.<P>



<B>Line of credit</B> - A form of loan in which the borrower draws down funds as needed, up to a specified maximum.<P>



<B>Mutual fund</B> - A pooled investment fund in which individuals can purchase units.<P>



<B>NSF</B> - Not sufficient funds in your account to cover the value of a cheque you have issued. (The service charge for an NSF cheque is high and, worse, writing NSF cheques can damage your credit record.)<P>



<B>Prime rate</B> - The interest rate banks charge corporate customers that have very good credit ratings.<P>



<B>Principal</B> - The amount of a loan excluding the interest.<P>



<B>RRSP</B> - Registered Retirement Savings Plan; a government-supported program that allows you to use contributions to defer the payment of income taxes and to build savings for retirement.<P>



<B>Surplus</B> - What's left over when income is higher than expenditures (opposite of deficit).<P>



<B>TDSR</B> - Total debt service ratio; the total of all monthly installment payments (loans, rent, taxes, utility payments, etc.), divided by gross income.<P>

<a name="term">

<B>Term</B> - The period of a loan during which the interest rate is fixed.  For example, the amortization of a loan might be 25 years (as is typically the case with mortgages), but the term may only be one year.  After the term expires, the interest rate will be fixed for another term.<P>

Credit cards give you convenient access to goods, services, and cash, and the monthly statements provide a handy check against your personal budget.<P>



But before deciding which card or cards to apply for, compare their features and costs.  Annual fees, transaction fees and interest rates vary greatly.  Look at the benefits of each card and measure them against your needs.  It makes little sense to get a card with features you have to pay for and that you'll never use.<P>

The best value in gold, the ScotiaGold VISA card gives you a wide range of value-added features, including Travel Emergency Medical Insurance as well as GoldChoice Rewards points that can be redeemed for an impressive selection of high-quality products, gift certificates and travel opportunities.<P>

<img align=left hspace=5 vspace=5 src="cvisa.gif">With the Scotiabank Classic VISA card, you get the convenience and security of a credit card.  Scotiabank Classic VISA provides access to goods and services as well as cash advances at banks and automated banking machines around the world.<P>

As well, you can order free personalized Scotia VISA Cheques which can be used just like a regular chequing account cheque, but the amount is charged to your VISA account.  These cheques are great for transferring balances from higher interest cards and are especially useful in those few places where a VISA card is not accepted such as at the doctor or dentist office, for insurance premiums, taxes, etc.<p>

Plus, you can provide your spouse or other family members with a supplementary card at no additional cost so they can also enjoy the convenience of a Classic VISA card.<p>

Value VISA rate effective in July, 1996.  Subject to change.]</I><P>

<P>
<font size=2>
A mutual fund pools your money along with that of other people and makes investments

according to the guidelines set for the Fund. Most mutual funds invest in stocks, bonds, mortgages, or money market instruments, or some combination of these. Because they're managed by professional portfolio advisors, mutual funds are an excellent way to invest, even if your investment knowledge is limited. <p>



<p>


Many mutual funds offer the potential for higher returns than other types of investments and they can play an important role in helping you meet your long-term financial objectives. Even if you have a small amount of money, you can use mutual funds to access markets in Canada and abroad.<p>

<P>

The Scotia Excelsior Funds represent a family of nineteen no-load funds combining selected elements from the original Scotia Mutual Funds and Montreal Trust Excelsior Funds.  Scotia Investment Management Ltd. and Montrusco Associates Inc., both subsidiaries of Scotiabank, employ experienced portfolio advisors who manage the Funds according to set investment objectives. <p>



Scotia Securities Inc. also uses several professional investment advisory firms in various world markets to provide counsel on foreign investments.<p>



<ul><b>Benefits</b>

<li>Almost any investment objective can be satisfied through the wide range of Funds. 

<li>You have the flexibility to shift investments between funds, at no charge, to take advantage of investment opportunities as they arise.

<li>All of the money you put in is invested, because there are no sales commissions.

<li>Building an investment portfolio couldn't be easier.

</ul>

<ul><b>Features</b>

<li>Scotia Excelsior Funds offer access to a wide variety of asset types (cash equivalent, income, growth) inclusive of domestic and foreign securities.

<li>You can easily switch between Funds without charge as your investment goals change.

<li>All the Funds are 'no-load'. That is, there is no commission charge to buy, sell or transfer within the Fund family.

<li>You can arrange regular automatic transfers from any savings or chequing account at most Canadian financial institutions, to your Scotia Excelsior Funds account. You can start with as little as $25 a month.

<li>If you have $10,000 or more invested, the Scotia Autopilot<font size=-2>&reg;</font> Service lets you invest on a percentage basis in various Funds to suit your investment objectives. It then automatically maintains those proportions for you by making quarterly adjustments to your portfolio. <p>

</ul>

<b><font size=+1>Commentary - Which Way G7 Bonds?</font></b><br>
<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>


<B>The recent increase in U.S. bond yields is being met with strong resistance in Continental Europe and Japan.</B>  While U.S. ten-year rates have backed up more than 20 b.p. since the end of November, German and French yields are virtually unchanged.  Italian rates continue to decline.  Japanese yields have stabilized below 2 1/2 per cent. <p> 

Only in the U.K. are rates now trending higher -- though even they have failed to match the full extent of the rising 
U.S. tide.<p>

<B>The divergence in bond market trends mirrors a sharp divergence in economic trends.</B>  The main Continental European economies have yet to regain a full head of steam.  German economic reports point to only a modest pace of recovery. The French economy is languishing with modest trade gains offset by weak domestic spending.  Italy is chalking up a subdued performance after virtually no growth in the first half of the year.  Unemployment is climbing to new peaks across the continent.  While the pace of  Japanese activity has been improving, momentum remains weak.<p>

<B>While the other G7 countries have been underperforming on the growth front, they have been outperforming the U.S. on the inflation front.</B>  French and German consumer prices are climbing at roughly half the U.S. rate of 3.2 per cent.  Italy -- which had the worst inflation record in the G7 only months ago -- has cut its inflation rate in half since the beginning of the year to 2.5 per cent.  Japanese consumer prices have been flat over the past twelve months.<p>



<B>Monetary policy overseas remains heavily geared towards accom-modation.</B>  While the Bundesbank remains on hold with the discount rate a mere 2.5 per cent, the Banque de France is still nudging rates lower in an attempt to kick-start its flagging economy.  Japanese rates are still close to all-time lows.<p>

<B>The U.K. remains the odd man out.</B>  The Bank of England has shifted its policy stance by <I>increasing</I> rates.  Policymakers are responding to <I>stronger</I> growth, <I>falling</I> unemployment and <I>rising</I> inflation.<p>

<B>There is still ample room for bond markets in Continental Europe and Japan to continue to outperform their U.S. counterparts.</B>  With the financial sector still fragile, an increase in Japanese rates is still not in the cards.  Meanwhile, fiscal restraint will continue to weigh on European growth as most countries scramble to meet the guidelines for monetary union.  While further Bundesbank easing may well be hard to come by, European bonds should be shielded from the full extent of the expected increase in U.S. rates next year.  <I>Even wider U.S.-German spreads (now more than 50 b.p.) would not be at odds with historical trends -- the gap has averaged 175 b.p. since 1980.</I><p>

<b><font size=+1>Financial Trends</font></b><br>
<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>


<B>Canadian financial markets ended another rocky week on a positive note.</B>  After yields moved sharply higher at the beginning of the week, domestic bonds rallied strongly on Thursday and Friday, leaving the long-term yield 5 basis points below the previous week's close.  The rally was sparked by a strong showing by U.S. fixed-income markets as a smattering of soft -- albeit minor -- economic reports offset the impact of stronger reports earlier in the week, alleviating concerns that the U.S. economy may be growing too fast to keep the lid on inflation.  Even so, U.S. long-term yields ended the week marginally higher than the previous Friday.  As a result, the long-term Canada-U.S. spread narrowed to 53 b.p. from 60 b.p.<p>

Equity markets on both sides of the border also recorded buoyant gains.  After opening on a soft note, the Dow roared back, climbing 126 points -- or 2 per cent -- on Thursday alone.  Blue-chip stocks led the gain after high-tech sectors made a strong contribution earlier in the week.  Overall, the DJIA jumped close to 200 points. <p>

The TSE300 followed suit on Thursday, rising 116 points or slightly more than 2 per cent after a strong performance from the energy sector earlier in the week.  For the week as a whole, the TSE300 gained nearly 150 points.<p>

The Canadian dollar ended slightly weaker against its U.S. counterpart.  The U.S. dollar was little changed against the major overseas currencies. <p>

<B>Net new sales of mutual funds (excluding reinvested distributions) surged to $5.3 billion in November, the strongest performance since the peak of the RRSP season last February.</B>  Purchases climbed more than 41 per cent above the level recorded in the previous month.  This leaves sales in the first eleven months of the year more than nine times higher than the same period in 1995. <p>

Purchases of domestic and Canadian foreign equity funds -- including U.S. funds -- continued to lead the pack, accounting for roughly 40 per cent of total sales.  However, sales of money market funds also gained significant ground, climbing to a new peak of more than $1.6 billion. <p>

Strong sales and buoyant equity markets helped lift mutual fund assets last month by 7.6 per cent to a record $208 billion.  Assets are now almost 50 per cent higher than they were only a year ago.<p>

Sales of mutual funds are likely to continue to perform strongly in the months ahead with the RRSP season getting underway.<p>

<Center><IMG src="mtr2.gif" alt="CANADIAN MUTUAL FUND ACTIVITY -- NOVEMBER"></Center><p>

<B>U.S. commercial bank lending jumped 0.8 per cent in November, the strongest increase in seven months.</B>  The gain brought a 13-month string of declining year-over-year growth to an end, with outstanding loans now 5.8 per cent above year-ago levels. <p>

A strong advance in business lending was propelled last month by large increases in commercial & industrial loans and non-financial commercial paper.  Lending was more subdued on the household side with rising real estate loans -- a reflection of the strong housing market -- partly offset by a second consecutive small decline in consumer credit.  Purchases of securities surged in November, though U.S. government paper accounted for only a quarter of the total.<p>

<Center><IMG src="mtr4.gif" alt="U.S. BANK LENDING TRENDS -- NOVEMBER"></Center><p>

<b><font size=+1>Economic Developments</font></b><br>
<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>	

<B>Canadian retail sales recorded a strong 1.1 per cent rise in October -- the largest advance so far this year.</B>  While a surge in auto sales accounted for more than half of the gain, strength was broad-based across most sectors with five of the seven categories recording higher purchases.  Food retailers also registered a hefty increase in receipts -- partly as a result of higher prices.  Furniture store sales dropped sharply, though this only partly offset the buoyant increases of the two previous months.<p>

Despite October's result, year-to-date retail figures are running only a modest 1.6 per cent higher than a year ago.  Ontario and Newfoundland are the only provinces to experience a decline in total receipts, falling 1.0 and 2.4 per cent respectively.  Saskatchewan has experienced the largest increase with a year-to-date jump of nearly 7 per cent. <p>

The increase in October sales suggests that spending is slowly turning the corner, with low interest rates fuelling purchases of big-ticket items.  Receipts are already an annualized 5.6 per cent above the third-quarter average -- 2.4 per cent after adjusting for price increases.  While consumers remain cautious, spending in Q4 is on track for a significant improvement over the lacklustre performance of the two previous quarters.<p>

<Center><IMG src="mtr3.gif" alt="CANADIAN RETAIL SALES -- OCTOBER"></Center><p>


Special factors pulled Canadian consumer prices up 0.3 per cent for the second consecutive month in November, lifting the year-over-year rate of inflation to 2 per cent.  In October, the CPI was boosted by a one-time levy on the gas bills of Ontario residents.  Last month, sharply higher auto insurance premiums -- again in Ontario -- and motor vehicle price changes for the new model year fuelled the increase.  Rising food prices also added to the gain.<p>

However, core inflation -- which excludes the volatile food and energy components -- edged only slightly higher to a 1.4 per cent year-over-year rate last month.  In addition, big price <I>declines</I> were recorded in sectors such as clothing & footwear and recreation, reading & education.  Mortgage interest costs also continued to fall, mirroring the declines in mortgage rates since the beginning of the year. <p>

Despite last month's uptick, there is little scope for higher inflation in the months ahead.  Excess capacity remains pervasive, soft consumer spending has left retailers with little pricing power, and weak labour market conditions are keeping the lid on wage pressures. <p>


<Center><IMG src="mtr5.gif" alt="CANADIAN CONSUMER PRICES (SA) -- NOVEMBER"></Center><p>

Consumer bankruptcies climbed to 7,645 in November, putting the total for the first eleven months of the year 22.1 per cent above the same period in 1995.  Consumer insolvencies have already exceeded last year's all-time high.  Likewise, business bankruptcies rose to 1,107 -- a 10.4 per cent increase year-to-date.  Business insolvencies  in the Atlantic provinces, Quebec and Manitoba have soared -- outpacing the rest of the country by a wide margin.   <p>

A three-week strike in Canada's auto sector sparked a 2.6 per cent decline in Canadian manufacturing shipments in October.  Shipments of motor vehicles and parts recorded a huge 21.2 per cent slide.  However, most other sectors opened the fourth quarter on a strong, not a weak note. <I>Excluding autos, shipments climbed a very solid 
1.6 per cent in October.</I> <p>

Strength was fairly broad-based across industry groups, with 15 of 22 sectors posting advances.  Shipments of petroleum & coal products -- which were boosted by rising crude oil prices -- and primary metals were particularly buoyant.  The food industry also recorded a very solid gain.<p>

The report suggests that manufacturing activity should snap back strongly in November -- building on the strong gains of the second and third quarters.  The lull in auto shipments should prove only temporary, as it was in March when a U.S. brake plant strike sparked a similarly large one-month slide.<p>

 
Moreover, manufacturers have started to replenish bare inventory shelves after paring back stocks in each of the first three quarters of the year.  Even so, the key inventory-to-shipments ratio remains at a still-low 1.36 and is likely to slip back in November as shipments rebound.  This suggests that increased demand in the months ahead should readily spill over to output gains.<p>

<Center><IMG src="mtr6.gif" alt="CANADIAN MANUFACTURING ACTIVITY -- OCTOBER"></Center><p>


<B>Canada's merchandise trade balance was cut in half to $1.5 billion in October, the smallest surplus since September 1994.</B>  However, this was largely the result of a three-week strike in the auto industry which temporarily curtailed shipments of motor vehicles -- about a quarter of Canadian exports -- to the United States.  Even with a sharply lower surplus in October, Canada's trade balance totalled $29.6 billion for the first ten months of the year -- above the all-time high of $28.4 billion recorded for all of 1995.<p>

<Center><IMG src="mtr7.gif" alt="CANADIAN MERCHANDISE TRADE -- OCTOBER"></Center><p>


Exports plummetted nearly 10 1/2 per cent in October to $21 billion with shipments of automotive products accounting for roughly three-quarters of the fall-off.  However, sales of industrial goods, office machinery and energy & forest products also weakened.  Meanwhile, imports sagged more than 3 per cent as strike activity weighed on purchases of auto parts and imports of communications equipment dipped from recent peaks.<p>


Shipments of motor vehicles should rebound strongly in November, allowing Canada's trade surplus to snap back into line with recent trends.<p>

<B>The U.S. trade deficit in goods and services narrowed to US$8.0 billion in October from just over US$11 billion in the prior three months.</B>  Despite the latest improvement, the annualized shortfall has averaged US$113.4 billion so far this year -- up nearly US$2.5 billion from the corresponding 1995 level.<p>

Exports rebounded 4.2 per cent in October, pushing year-over-year sales up at the fastest pace since mid-year.  Sales of capital goods (mainly civilian aircraft and telecommunications equipment), industrial supplies and consumer products all rose sharply, more than offsetting weaker shipments of automotive vehicles and parts.  While imports eased slightly, they remain essentially unchanged from peak third-quarter levels.  Automotive vehicles, parts and engines were particularly hard hit -- largely as a result of the auto strike in Canada.<p>

The trade deficit with Canada narrowed for the third time in the last four months, although the imbalance is on track to rise by roughly US$4.5 billion this year.  The shortfall with Japan ballooned and is now above year-earlier levels for the first time since the spring of 1995.<p>

<Center><IMG src="mtr8.gif" alt="U.S. TRADE (BOP basis) -- OCTOBER"></Center><p>


<B>U.S. industrial production soared 0.9 per cent in November after recording a small decline in the previous month.</B>  The gain was fuelled by a 6.3 per cent surge in output of motor vehicles & parts and a strong weather-related jump in utilities.  Manufacturing also recorded a solid advance, while mining output only edged up.  With last month's result, a 2.7 per cent  increase in industrial production is already built in to the fourth quarter -- pointing to a solid, though not a stellar performance.<p>

<Center><IMG src="mtr9.gif" alt="U.S. INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION -- NOVEMBER"></Center><p>

November's strong increase in output pushed the capacity utilization rate up 0.4 percentage point to 83.7 per cent.  While this is line with the peak for the year reached in June -- when expectations of Fed tightening were running high -- it remains below the cyclical peak of more than 85 per cent recorded in early 1995. <p>


<a name="ind"></a><center><img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br>
<b><font size=+1>Industries and Commodities</font></b><br>
<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>

<B>Scotiabank's Commodity Price Index rose by 2.3 per cent in November, after two months of decline.</B>  Gains in the Oil and Gas, Metal and Mineral and Forest Product Indices more than offset lower agricultural prices.<p>

Over the past twelve months, the All Items Index has fallen by 3.6 per cent.  Though the Oil and Gas Index advanced by a strong 10.8 per cent and Forest Products edged up by 3.3 per cent, the Metal and Mineral Index and the Agricultural Index dropped by 10.3 per cent and 11.7 per cent respectively.  <p>

Slow international growth has been the main constraint on commodity prices.  While growth is likely to remain modest in the first half of 1997, the global inventory correction in nickel-containing stainless steel and U.S. aluminium cansheet should come to an end -- pointing to stronger metal prices in the second half of the year.  U.S. publisher stocks of newsprint have been largely worked off, suggesting a near-term bottoming in prices.  North American auto production will also rebound from fourth-quarter strikes, with a large ripple effect on raw material demand.<p>

<B>The strongest November performance since 1986 propelled Greater Metropolitan Toronto new home sales 126 per cent above weak year-earlier levels. </B> Year-to-date new home sales were 58 per cent above the 1995 pace and are on track to total 20,000 units for 1996 -- the highest since 1988.  Still, new home sales will only be about half the level recorded during the peak of a decade ago.<p>

The recent bottoming-out of new home prices and record-low mortgage rates have finally spurred move-up buyers into real estate.  A continued low interest rate environment, firm new and existing home sales and tightening supplies of modest existing homes should continue to underpin Toronto construction activity into 1997.<p>

<B>U.S. housing starts jumped to an annualized 1.51 million units in November from an already-solid 1.46 million average in the previous three months.</B>  Multiple-unit construction jumped 15 per cent to 350,000 units last month, reflecting builders' tendency to start apartment buildings ahead of cold weather.  Single-family starts rose a more modest 8 per cent to 1.16 million units, reversing substantial declines in the previous two months.  Starts are now 9 per cent higher year-to-date than in 1995.  Home construction rose or remained unchanged in all regions, with only the Northeastern United States posting losses. <p>

<Center><IMG src="mtr10.gif" alt="U.S. HOUSING STARTS -- NOVEMBER"></Center><p>
	

U.S. building permits -- an indicator of future construction -- rose a modest 4 per cent following a string of four declines over the past six months.   The trend in permits suggests that homebuilding will continue at a more modest pace in the months ahead.  Permits increased in the Midwest and the South, but fell in the Northeastern and Western regions of the United States.  <p>


Housing starts are on track to total 1.48 million units this year -- the strongest performance of the current expansion.  Residential construction will likely ease to 1.39 million units in the year ahead, as mortgage rates edge higher and pent-up-demand winds down.<p>

<b><font size=+1>International Trends</font></b><br>
<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>

<B>The U.K. unemployment rate slipped to 6.9 per cent -- its lowest level since early 1991 as the number of unemployed plunged 95,800.</B>  In addition, job vacancies increased by a further 7,000 in the month, pushing the number of openings to a record high.<p>

The steady improvement in labour market conditions has been spilling over to consumer spending.  British retail sales volumes increased 0.7 per cent in November and were 3.9 per cent above the year-earlier level.  With the economy gaining ground, the Bank of England will likely continue to tighten monetary policy -- in contrast to the trends in the other G7 countries.<p>

The U.K. current account recorded a modest &#163;71 million (US$110 mn.) deficit in the third quarter of 1996, following a (revised) &#163;344 million surplus in Q2.  A decline in the  investment income surplus in Q3 more than offset a smaller trade deficit.<p>

<B>The German Bundesbank has announced that the M3 target range for both 1997 and 1998 will be 3.5-6.5 per cent compared with 4.0-7.0 per cent this year.</B>  M3 grew at an annualized rate of 8.0 per cent in November, moderately slower than October's 8.4 per cent pace.  Despite the overshoot of the monetary growth target, both discount and Lombard rates were unchanged following this week's Council meeting.  The Bundesbank also announced that the repo rate would be held steady at 3.00 per cent for the next three auctions.<p>

<B>The Banque de France nudged interest rates lower this week in the wake of continuing stability in the Ffr/DM cross-rate.</B>  The intervention rate was reduced 5 b.p. to 3.15 per cent while the 5-10 day repo rate was cut 15 b.p. to 4.75 per cent.  The move follows last week's cut by the Swiss National Bank.  In addition, France's commercial banks lowered prime rate by 25 b.p. to 6.30 per cent.  The franc continues to hold steady at Ffr3.38/DM despite the slight narrowing of short-term spreads over Frankfurt.<p>

The French economy needs all the help it can get.  Industrial production fell 0.8 per cent in October -- the second consecutive monthly decline -- and was up just 1.4 per cent from a year earlier.  The residential construction sector is doing even more poorly:  housing starts through November were down 4.7 per cent from a year ago.  With output so sluggish, it is not surprising that inflation has been very subdued.  Consumer prices slipped 0.1 per cent in November and were up 1.6 per cent from a year earlier, bringing French inflation back in line with Germany.<p>


<a name="week"></a><center><img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br>
<b><font size=+1>Focus on the Czech Republic </font></b><br>
<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>


<B>The Czech economy is on a 4-5 per cent growth trajectory -- roughly double the pace of expansion in Western Europe.</B>  This compares with a cumulative 22 per cent decline over the period 1990-93.  Industrial output rose 7 per cent in the first nine months of 1996.  Economic activity is being underpinned by substantial increases in business investment and consumer spending.  This momentum should carry forward through 1997.<p>

<B>The cautious approach to economic reform that has characterized the Czech Republic's "velvet revolution" has so far been successful. </B> The unemployment rate of just over 3 per cent is one of  the lowest in the OECD.  Employment gains in small, newly created firms have offset losses in larger companies.  The Czech Republic offers a well-educated, highly-skilled and ambitious labour force and wages are less than one-quarter of those prevailing in Germany.  However, tight credit and recent large increases in wages point to a slower pace of job creation through 1997.    <p>

<B>Inflation has been reduced to single-digit levels -- compared with a peak of 60 per cent in 1991.</B>  There will be only limited further improvement in 1997 due to the phased price liberalization of regulated sectors -- including utilities.  The Central Bank will maintain a tight monetary policy to contain any build-up of inflationary pressures.  As well, the authorities are expected to remain committed to a prudent fiscal policy, despite some slippage in 1995 and 1996.  <p>

<B>Net foreign direct investment is expected to total US$1.5 billion in 1996. </B> This compares with a robust $2.5 billion in 1995, including $1.3 billion due to the sale of SPT Telecom.   The bulk of activity has been in transportation and communications, followed by consumer goods.   The chemicals industry has been attracting significant interest recently.  Germany is the largest investor, accounting for 30 per cent of the total compared with 14 per cent from both Switzerland and the United States. <p>

<B>Equity prices have been dragged down recently amid concerns over the soundness of the financial  industry that were sparked by the collapse of Kreditni Banka in August 1996.</B>  Over the first 8 months of the year, stock prices rallied almost 40 per cent (in U.S. dollar terms), largely reflecting investor optimism over the longer-term prospects for the economy. Despite the recent retreat, the Prague PX-50 stock index is still up almost 20 per cent (in U.S. dollar terms) from the end of 1995.   <p>

<Center><IMG src="mtr11.gif" alt="KEY ECONOMIC INDICATORS"></Center><p>
 

<B>Tight monetary policies had fuelled an inflow of short-term portfolio capital in 1994-95, putting upward pressure on the koruna. </B> This has tended to dampen Czech competitiveness and push the trade and current accounts deeper into deficit.   However, the koruna has weakened somewhat in 1996 -- at least in nominal terms.  Foreign exchange reserves have declined moderately this year after more than doubling in 1995.  In order to obtain more policy flexibility, the monetary authorities widened the exchange rate band to ±7.5 per cent from &#177;0.5 per cent in February 1996. The koruna is expected to slip to about kr30/US$ by end-1997 as the large current account shortfall exerts downward pressure.<p>

The Czech Republic has successfully diversified its export base since the collapse of COMECON when sales to that region accounted for over three-quarters of the total.  Shipments to the EU now account for over 55 per cent of foreign sales, while Central and Eastern Europe (excluding Slovakia) take just under 17 per cent.  <p>

<B>Export growth slowed to 3 per cent in the first nine months of 1996, while imports advanced 12 per cent, leading to a sharp widening of the trade deficit.</B>  Export earnings have slipped due to the decline in EU demand and diminishing competitiveness, while imports are being driven by strong levels of both consumer spending and business investment.  This trend will likely persist into 1998, when the shopping spree will probably begin to abate.  As a result, the current account deficit will continue to widen through 1997 despite the rise in tourism earnings -- which are approaching US$2.5 billion annually.<p>

<B>Canada is looking like a big winner as the year draws to a close.</B>  Economic activity is slowly, but surely, gearing up.  Inflation is at a low ebb with no significant pressures in sight. Governments have been making huge strides in cleaning up the nation's  public finances.  Our external borrowing needs have been wiped out. <p>

<B>The financial market payoff from the sharp improvement in our inflation, fiscal, and external fundamentals has been substantial.</B>  Three-month T-bill yields have plunged more than 2 1/2 percentage points since the early days of 1996.  Long-term yields have dropped more than half a percentage point.  Administered borrowing costs are at their lowest levels in well over three decades.  Even with narrow-to-negative spreads off New York, the Canadian dollar remains relatively unscathed at around 73 cents(US).<p>

<B>The bullish market tone has allowed the Bank of Canada to pull out all the stops to kick start our sputtering economy.</B>   Governor Thiessen has eased policy eleven times this year despite only one move by the U.S. Federal Reserve in January.  The central bank's Monetary Conditions Index is at an all-time low with  the recent back-up in market interest rates offset by a weaker dollar.  The yield curve is at its steepest setting in 25 years with the spread between short and long-term yields a whopping 4.2 percentage points.<p>


</td>
<TD WIDTH = 300 VALIGN = "TOP">


<B>Sharply lower interest rates are bearing fruit.  </B>Key interest-sensitive sectors of the economy such as housing and investment in machinery and equipment have received a solid boost.  Similarly, consumer spending on big-ticket items is reviving.  With October's 1.1 per cent rise in retail sales -- the largest gain this year -- sales volumes are already running 2.4 per cent above the average level recorded in the third quarter.  Further gains may well be in store for the final months of 1996 -- department store sales surged in November while the previous month's jump in auto purchases was sustained.<p>
 
<B>Bank of Canada policy should remain heavily geared towards monetary accommodation.</B>  Excess capacity and high unemployment will keep the lid on any significant build-up in inflationary pressures.  Even so, the central bank is unlikely to be able to fully insulate domestic rates from the upward tilt in U.S. yields in 1997 -- in contrast to Canada, the U.S. economy is running close to full capacity and employment conditions remain tight.<p>

<B>Low borrowing costs and a competitive currency should help propel Canada to the top of the G7 growth ladder in 1997.</B>  Exports are set to be lifted to new peaks with the U.S. economy still on a steady growth path.  Domestic spending should receive an additional boost from stronger employment gains and tax relief in several provinces. <p>

<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>



<ul>

<li>By maintaining a minimum monthly balance of $1,000 in a Scotia Powerchequing account, regular transaction and maintenance fees are waived.

<li>By using a Scotia Cashstop Automated Banking Machine for cash withdrawals, you can avoid the $1.00 INTERAC fee applicable over and above the regular account transaction fees.

<li>Using a ScotiaCard for INTERAC direct payment purchases instead of writing a cheque, results in a 25% savings in service fees with a Scotia Powerchequing or Scotia Chequing (excluding Scotiaclub) account.  And you'll avoid the hassle of carrying cheques and the time for approvals too.

<li>By having Overdraft Protection, you can avoid the embarrassment and expense of having insufficient funds in your account, since all debit transactions (i.e. cheques, pre-authorized payments, etc.) will be honoured up to your pre-set overdraft limit.

</ul>

<li>Scotiabank offers a four-tiered rate of interest tied to your current (business) accounts.

<li>When your balance increases, such as at the start of a term, your interest rate automatically increases on your entire balance.
<li>And, when your balance is lower (for example near the end of April), you will continue to receive income on your current account since there is no minimum balance requirement.

</CENTER><p>



It's a great way to help young people learn about everyday banking and the benefits of saving.<P>

Our Getting There Savings Program is designed especially for customers under 19. There are none of the usual account service fees and bonus interest is paid monthly on daily balances in the Getting There Daily Interest Savings Account - with an even higher rate of interest when the balance is $500 and over.<p>

To help young customers get into the saving habit, Getting There account holders who make deposits are eligible to win monthly cash prizes and a grand prize each year.<p>



Our Getting There customers are also eligible for a Scotia Card (the co-signature of a parent or legal guardian is required for customers 15 years of age and under).

If you keep a high balance in your savings account, consider the Scotia Gain Plan Investment Savings Account. This account is ideal as the first building block in your investment savings plan or as the liquid portion of your investment portfolio. <p>

You earn interest on every dollar. The higher your balance, the more you earn; balances over $5,000 earn competitive investment rates. Record-keeping is simple with your choice of passbook or monthly statement.<p>

<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>

You can save money by minimizing service fees with our Scotia Powerchequing Account -- a great idea for anyone who likes to combine savings and cheque-writing in one account.

<ul>

<li>By keeping your minimum monthly balance at $1,000 or more, many of your everyday banking activities are free. 

<li>Interest on your Scotia Powerchequing account is calculated on daily balances, and as your balance gets higher, so does the interest rate. (Interest rates are tiered based on balances.)

<li>You can save money with reduced service fees by using your ScotiaCard bank card to make certain transactions. 

<li>Overdraft Protection (subject to credit approval) and the return of your cancelled cheques are also available for a nominal fee.

<li>Keeping track of transactions and balances is easy with your choice of passbook or 

monthly statement.

</ul>

<b><font size=+1>SCOTIA CHEQUING Account</font></b><br>

<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>

If you find managing your financial records easier when you have your cancelled cheques returned, then the Scotia Chequing account may be for you. 

<ul>

<li>Every month you receive a monthly statement along with the cheques processed that month - at no additional charge. 

<li>You can save money with reduced service fees by using your ScotiaCard bank card to make certain transactions. 

<li>Overdraft Protection is also available for a low monthly fee (subject to credit approval). 

<li>As the Scotia Chequing account earns no interest, many customers use it along with a Scotiabank <a href="saveacct.htm">savings account</a> and our <a href="PayYourselfTooPlan.html">Pay Yourself Too Plan</a> program. Ask us for details.<p>

<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all>
<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE = +1><STRONG>An easy, automatic way to grow your RRSP</STRONG></FONT><BR><BR>
</center>

<STRONG>A little goes a long way</STRONG><BR><BR>


Set aside a small amount of money on a regular basis and you'll be amazedhow quickly your RRSP can grow.
A Pay Yourself Too Plan automatically deducts a specified amount on a regular basis from your chequing or savings
account and deposits it directly into your Scotia RRSP.<BR><BR>


<STRONG><FONT SIZE = +1>Add up the reasons to Pay Yourself Too!</FONT></STRONG><BR><BR>


<STRONG><I>It's easy on your budget</I></STRONG><BR><BR>
		
You can contribute as little as $25 a month to your RRSP through a Scotia Pay Yourself Too Plan. 
Over the long term, that goes a long way toward building a comfortable nest egg, while still allowing you
to meet yourday-to-day financial commitments.<BR><BR>

<STRONG><I>Compounding earns you money</I></STRONG><BR><BR>

By investing regularly, you generate returns on the amount you invest each month as well as on the amount
that money has earned.  As a result of this 'compounding', your RRSP grows faster than if you made a single
contribution closer to the RRSP deadline.<BR><BR>

<STRONG><I>You can avoid the rush of last-minute contributions</I></STRONG><BR><BR>

Regular transfers to your RRSP can ensure you never miss maximizingyour annual contributions.
It can also help you contribute as early in the year as possible.<BR><BR>

<STRONG><I>You may be able to pay less tax each pay period</I></STRONG><BR><BR>

Rather than waiting for your tax refund, you may notify Revenue Canada of your regular RRSP contributions so
they can instruct youremployer to deduct less income tax from each pay cheque.  Pick up a Tax Deduction Waiver
from your local tax office or your Scotiabank branch.<BR><BR>

<CENTER><STRONG>How large could your RRSP grow over 25 years with $250 a month?</STRONG><BR>
$212,218
</CENTER>

<BR><BR>

This is what your RRSP can be if you contribute $250 at the beginning ofeach month for 25 years through a
Scotia Pay Yourself Too Plan.<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE =+1>Put Dollar Cost Averaging to work for you too! </FONT><BR><BR>

When you invest a fixed amount of money in mutual funds on a regularbasis, the principle of dollar cost
averaging means you don't need toworry about trying to predict the highs and lows of investment markets.
<BR><BR>
Quite simply, when the unit price of a fund is lower, your money buys more units.  When the unit price is higher,
it buys fewer units.  Over time, this may have the effect of lowering the average cost of your investments compared
to lump sum investing.<BR><BR>

<STRONG><I>The Advantages of Dollar-Cost Averaging</I></STRONG><BR><BR>

By investing a fixed amount regularly, you use short-term price dips as buying opportunities.<BR><BR>

<CENTER>
<IMG SRC ="images/blackChart.gif"><BR>

</CENTER>
<BR><BR>

<STRONG><I>Make Time to Pay Yourself Too!</I></STRONG><BR><BR>

Even if you're living on a tight budget right now, try to pay yourself too by saving a little on a regular basis.
Before long, the power of compounding AND dollar-cost averaging will have you on the road to a more secure future.

</CENTER><p>

Enjoy peace of mind and convenience with Scotiabank's Overdraft Protection (subject to credit approval). <p>



You can have the peace of mind of 'cheque protection'.  Scotiabank will honour a cheque or withdrawal for more than the balance in your account (up to a pre-determined limit). It lets you avoid the embarrassment and cost of NSF cheques and eliminates the inconvenience of having to transfer funds to cover a temporary shortage, all for a small monthly fee. <p>

Overdraft Protection is available on most chequing and savings accounts.<p>

Overdraft interest only applies when you use the service.<p>

<b><font size=+1>What types of mortgages are available?</font></b><br>

<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>



For the purchase of a home, Scotia Mortgage Corporation (SMC) normally offers three basic types of residential <B>first mortgages</B>:

<OL>

<LI><B>Conventional -- "Low Ratio" --</B> Loan amounts which do not exceed 75% of the lesser of the appraised value or the purchase price of the property.

<LI><B>National Housing Act (NHA)</B> -- Loan amounts of up to 90%** of the value are normally available.  NHA mortgages are insured by Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a Federal Government Corporation.

<li><b>Conventional -- "Insured" --</b> Loan amounts of up to 90%** are available.  Mortgages are insured by the General Electric Mortgage Insurance Company (GEMICO), a private insurer.

</OL>

** Insured loans up to 95% of the lending value may be available to first time home buyers.<p>

<b>For interest rates contact your local <a href="scolocat.htm">Scotiabank branch</a>.</b><p>

<b><font size=+1>Can I obtain a mortgage on my cottage or leisure home?</font></b><br>

<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>



Based on the kind of structure, its location and accessibility, we may be able to provide you with a first mortgage at our regular residential first mortgage rates.  Ask for details at any <a href="scolocat.htm">Scotiabank branch</a> in Canada about our Cottage and Leisure Home program.<P>



<a name="terms"></a><center><img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br>

<b><font size=+1>What are the terms of the mortgages?</font></b><br>

<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>



First mortgages are available with a fixed rate of interest for various terms, ranging from 6 months to 7 years, with payments amortized over periods of up to 25 years.  In addition, SMC offers variable rate mortgages.<P>



Scotiabank's experienced Managers and mortgage specialists can help you decide which mortgage best suits your needs.<P>



Fixed rate mortgages can be "closed" or "open".  The "open" mortgage allows you to prepay some or all of your outstanding mortgage balance at any time without penalty.  These "open" mortgages are available for either a 6 month or 1 year term and generally have a slightly higher rate of interest than "closed" mortgages for an equivalent term.<P>



"Closed" mortgages are available in a wide range of terms, from 6 months to 7 years.  These "closed" mortgages cannot be prepaid in full prior to maturity without being subject to an interest penalty.  Certain prepayments, as provided for in the mortgage agreement, can, however, be made under SMC's <a href="crmort2.htm#prepay">prepayment options</a>.

<b><font size=+1>What should I budget for a home purchase?</font></b><br>

<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>

Before making a home-buying decison, you should calculate both the one-time and ongoing costs associated with buying and operating the home.<p>

As a guide for preparing a budget, consider the following:<p>

<ul>

<li>Costs associated with the purchase of a home include:

<ul>

<li>appraisal fees

<li>cost to obtain a survey

<li>land transfer taxes

<li>CMHC / GEMICO mortgage insurance (if applicable) 

<li>moving expenses

<li>legal fees

</ul>

<dl>

<dd><i>You may wish to consult an experienced lawyer who will provide estimates of some of these costs at the outset of your planning.  A lawyer should be consulted before you sign any documents or make any commitments.</i><p>

</dl>

<li>Ongoing housing costs include:

<ul>

<li>monthly mortgage payments

<li>property taxes

<li>mortgage life insurance

<li>heating costs

<li>costs of secondary financing, such as a second mortgage (if applicable)

<li>condominium fees (if applicable)

<li>operating and maintenance costs<p>

</ul>

<li>Some general rules of thumb:

<ul>

<li>Your monthly mortgage payments, taxes, heating costs, secondary financing payment and 50% of condominium fees should not exceed 32% of your gross annual income.  This is called your Gross Debt Service Ratio.

<li>Your Gross Debt Service Ratio plus monthly payments on any other outstanding debts (including loan payments, car payments, credit card payments, and department store accounts, etc.) should not exceed 40% of your gross annual income.  This is called your Total Debt Service Ratio.

<li>Under normal circumstances, you should budget about 2% of the value of your home to cover annual operating and maintenance costs which are not included in your Gross or Total Debt Service Ratios.

</ul>

</ul>

<b><font size=+1>How will the bank evaluate my ability to repay a mortgage?</font></b><br>

<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>

The Bank will assess your mortgage application using basic principles of credit adjudication.  Click <a href="croption.htm">here</a> for a full description of your credit options.<P>

<b><font size=+1>Can I pre-arrange my mortgage?</font></b><br>

<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>

Based on your financial situation, we can provide you with a Scotia Approved Mortgage Certificate which pre-qualifies you for a maximum amount of mortgage financing**, at a specified interest rate, for a period of 60 days from the certificate date.<p>

If interest rates increase during this period, yours won't.  With a Scotia Pre-Approved Mortgage, you know the maximum amount of financing which could be available to you**.  Now you can hunt for the right home at the right price, knowing you qualify for a mortgage.<p>

** Subject to the home meeting our residential standards and maximum permitted loan amounts.<p>

<b><font size=+1>Should I consider a "Convertible Mortgage"?</font></b><br>

<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>

Yes. Our "Scotia Flexible Mortgage", a fixed rate six month closed mortgage, enables you to early renew or convert at any time during the six month term to a closed fixed rate mortgage with a term of one to seven years at no cost.  This allows you the flexibility of arranging financing for your home today, while retaining the ability to take advantage of potentially lower interest rates tomorrow.<p>



<a name="variable"></a>

<center><img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br>

<b><font size=+1>Should I consider a Variable Rate Mortgage?</font></b><br>

<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>

A Variable Rate Mortgage has an interest rate that usually changes with Scotiabank's Prime Rate fluctuations.  The principal advantage of a Variable Rate Mortgage is that, while the payment amount remains constant for a certain term, should rates decline, you are not locked into a fixed higher rate mortgage.  Conversely, if you anticipate that interest rates will be rising, you can switch from a regular Variable Rate Mortgage to a Fixed Rate Mortgage for a fee, under the terms and conditions then available.<p>

For those who are considering a Variable Rate Mortgage, Scotia Mortgage Corporation offers two competitive options:<p>

<ol>

<li><b>Regular Variable Rate Mortgage</b>

<dl>

<dd>The term of a Regular Variable Rate Mortgage is three years.  While the payment amount remains constant for the term, if the interest rate during the term is, on average, below the initial interest rate, your mortgage balance will decrease faster (and you'll pay your mortgage off sooner).  However, if mortgage rates increase, your mortgage balance may increase.  It may be necessary to increase your monthly payments to cover increased mortgage costs.<p>

<dd>You can repay the regular Variable Rate Mortgage in full at any time, subject to an administration fee.<p>

<dd>You can also make partial prepayments at any time without penalty or administration fee -- and pay off your mortgage sooner.<p>

</dl>

<li><b>Scotia Rate Protector<font size=-2>&reg;</font> Mortgage (SRPM)</b>

<dl>

<dd>SRPM offers you the flexibility of a Variable Rate Mortgage, plus protection from potential interest rate increases during the term of the mortgage, over a preset limit / maximum.<p>

<dd>The term of the SRPM is five years.  During this term you pay the same amount each month.  Your monthly payments are based on the SRPM Maximum Rate -- a great way to ensure your mortgage balance is paid off as quickly as possible.  If the variable interest rate reaches or exceeds the SRPM Maximum Rate, the rate will be capped at the SRPM Maximum Rate for the remaining term and will not fluctuate downward should rates decline prior to your maturity date.<p>

<dd>The SRPM can be paid out at any time during the term with a three month interest penalty, calculated at the SRPM Maximum Interest Rate.  You can also convert your mortgage to a fixed rate or regular Variable Rate Mortgage with a two month interest penalty, calculated at the SRPM Maximum Interest Rate.  You can prepay up to 15% of the original principal amount of your mortgage once each year, and you can increase the amount of your mortgage payment originally established for the current term of the mortgage by up to 15% once each year -- without penalty or administration fee.

</dl>

</ol>

<b><font size=+1>How can I save money on my mortgage?</font></b><br>

<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>

The easiest way to reduce the interest costs on your mortgage is to pay it off sooner.  Here's how:<p>

<ul>

<a name="biw"></a>

<li><b>Pay Weekly or Bi-Weekly</b> -- Making your mortgage payments earlier and more frequently through weekly or bi-weekly payments can save you a significant amount of interest, as compared to monthly payments.  Ask us to show you how much interest you may not have to pay by increasing the frequency of your payments.

<li><b>Prepay</b> -- You can prepay up to 15% of the original principal amount of your mortgage anytime during each year of the term of your mortgage -- without penalty or administration fee.

<li><b>Increase your monthly payments</b> -- Once each year during the term of your mortgage you can increase your monthly mortgage payments by up to 15% of the monthly payment originally established for the current term of the mortgage -- without penalty or administration fee.

<li><b>Match-A-Payment<font size=-2>TM</font> Option</b> -- Scotia Mortgage Corporation's Match-A-Payment option allows you to pay an additional amount equal to your current mortgage payment of principal and interest (as well as taxes and insurance, if applicable) on any regular payment date -- you can match a payment once a year or every month -- the choice is yours.  The full amount of the extra payment is taken directly off the principal of your mortgage.  It's a great way to reduce interest costs and pay off your mortgage sooner.

</ul>

<p>

<a name="miss"></a>

<center><img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br>

<b><font size=+1>What is the Miss-A-Payment Option?</font></b><br>

<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>

With a Scotiabank mortgage, if you've made prepayments or additional payments on your mortgage, you can miss one or more of your scheduled mortgage payments of Principal and Interest (as well as taxes and insurance, if applicable) provided the amount(s) missed do not exceed the amount you've prepaid or additional mortgage payments made during the current term of the mortgage.  It's another way we've built flexibility into our mortgages.<p>

<a name="renew"></a>

<center><img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br>

<b><font size=+1>Can I renew my mortgage early?</font></b><br>

<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>

Yes.  You have the option of renewing your mortgage at any time during the term under our Early Renewal Program.  Details and conditions are available at your local <a href="scolocat.htm">Scotiabank branch</a>.<p>

<a name="switch"></a>

<center><img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br>

<b><font size=+1>Can I switch my mortgage from another lender to Scotiabank (SMC)?</font></b><br>

<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>

If you already have a residential first mortgage on your home in Canada with another approved lender, you can switch your mortgage to us.  Certain conditions may apply.<p>

<a name="port"></a>

<center><img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br>

<b><font size=+1>Is my mortgage portable?</font></b><br>

<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>

Yes.  When you move from one home to another in Canada**, you can take your existing Scotia Mortgage Corporation mortgage with you, at the same interest rate, for the remaining term.  Or, you can combine your existing mortgage balance with additional financing at a blended rate to finance your new home.  No interest penalty or administration fee will be charged.<p>

** Subject to the home meeting our residential standards and maximum permitted loan amounts.<p>

<a name="incr"></a>

<center><img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br>

<b><font size=+1>Can I increase the amount of my existing mortgage and blend the rate?</font></b><br>

<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>

Yes.  When you wish to increase the amount of your Scotia Mortgage Corporation mortgage to obtain additional funds or buy another property in Canada**, SMC will provide you with a "blended rate".  This rate is a weighted average of the rate of your existing mortgage and the mortgage rate applicable to the additional funds requested.  No interest penalty will be charged but the resulting term of the mortgage must be equal or greater than the remaining term on your existing mortgage.<p>

** Subject to the home meeting our residential standards and maximum permitted loan amounts.<p>



<a name="insur"></a>

<center><img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br>

<b><font size=+1>What is Mortgage Insurance?</font></b><br>

<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>



If the amount of your mortgage exceeds 75% of the lending value of the property being mortgaged, the mortgage is considered "high ratio" and, as required by law if you borrow from most financial institutions, you must purchase mortgage insurance for the full amount of the mortgage.  Mortgage insurance is available from CMHC and GEMICO.<p>

If you are required to purchase mortgage insurance, you will have to pay an application fee and an insurance premium (which you can add to the mortgage amount) to the insurer.  Mortgage insurance provides protection to the lender in the event that you default, forcing the Bank to take legal action leading to possession of the property. <p>

Mortgage insurance has nothing to do with either <a href="crmort2.htm#life">mortgage life insurance</a> or home, property, fire and casualty insurance.  <p>

In some cases, Scotiabank may require a mortgage to be insured even if the loan-to-value ratio is less than 75%.  For example, the Bank may require insurance as a condition of the loan if the property is considered higher risk (e.g. the home is in a highly volatile real estate market, or may be difficult to resell).<P>



<a name="life"></a>

<center><img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br>

<b><font size=+1>Why should I consider Scotia Mortgage Life Insurance</font></b><br>

<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>

A home is usually your largest single investment.  It's an investment worth protecting.<p>

Scotia Mortgage Life Insurance offers joint or single insurance protection for SMC customers with mortgages on residential dwellings.  In the event of the death of an insured person, the insurer (The Canada Life Assurance Company) will pay the amount required to discharge the insured amount of the mortgage, to a maximum of $500,000 for all insured properties.<p>

<b>Who is eligible?</b><br>

To apply for coverage you must hold a Scotia Mortgage Corporation mortgage, be under the age of 65, and a resident of Canada.  Coverage will terminate for each individual at age 70.<p>

<b>What's the cost of Scotia Mortgage Life Insurance?</b><br>

Monthly premiums for single coverage (i.e. one person) are based on your age and mortgage balance at the time you apply for the insurance.  Visit your local <a href="scolocat.htm">Scotiabank branch</a> in Canada for details.<p>



<a name="scomort"></a><center><img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br>

<b><font size=+1>Who is Scotia Mortgage Corporation?</font></b><br>

<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>

Scotia Mortgage Corporation is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Bank of Nova Scotia.  At more than 1,100 Scotiabank branches across Canada, experienced staff can help you arrange a SMC mortgage, at competitive rates, to purchase a home.  Or, you may refinance the mortgage on your present home to obtain additional funds for home renovations, consolidating existing loans or mortgages, installing an inground pool, etc.<P>



<center><img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br>

<b><font size=+1>What do these mortgage terms mean in plain language?</font></b><br>

<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>



Scotiabank's mortgage forms are designed to ensure our obligations and yours are spelled out in words and phrases which are as clear and simple as we can make them. <p>

The mystery can be taken out of home financing if you are familiar with the terminology of the trade.  The "mortgage talk" in the <a href="crmort6.htm"><b>Mortgage Terminology</b></a> section, while not necessarily legally precise because of brevity, will nevertheless guide you through most home financing considerations and discussions.

The following worksheet serves as a guide to monthly costs per $1,000 of mortgage loan. <p>

<ol>

<li>Divide the amount of your mortgage by 1,000

<li>Determine the appropriate Monthly Mortgage Payment Factor from the chart below.

<li>Multiply your answer from #1 by the Factor from #2 to arrive at your estimated monthly mortgage payment.

</ol>

<p>

If, for example:<br>

<ul>

<li>your mortgage is for $100,000

<li>the current interest rate is 8%

<li>and the amortization period of your mortgage is 15 years

<li>you will simply multiply the appropriate Monthly Mortgage Payment Factor (9.48) by 100 (representing your $100,000 mortgage divided by 1,000) to arrive at your monthly mortgage payment ($948).

What kind of credit do I need?  What can I afford?  What's the best way to repay?  What are my options concerning terms?  Should I use credit at all?  You should ask these questions before applying for any kind of credit.<P>



Before applying for credit or refinancing an existing loan, take a look at your financial situation to make sure you can comfortably repay the debt.  Compare your income to your regular expenses.  Do you have enough of a surplus?  Is your cash flow regular enough to permit monthly or weekly repayments without putting you in an occasional cash bind?<P>

<b><font size=+1>10 Questions Your Bank Will Ask You</font></b><br>

<OL>

<LI> What is your job?

<LI> How long have you worked there?

<LI> What is your total gross family income?

<LI> What is your date of birth?

<LI> Do you currently own or rent the place where you live?

<LI> What is the monthly amount of rent or mortgage you are now paying?

<LI> What is the current market value of your home (if you are a homeowner)?

<LI> What outstanding loans do you have, if any?

<LI> What are your assets -- car, home, investments -- and their value?

<LI> What are your monthly liabilities (include regular bills and payments such as car and property insurance)?

</OL><P>

<b><font size=+1>10 Questions You Should Ask Your Bank</font></b><br>

<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>



<OL>

<LI> How can I increase or decrease the amount I have to pay each month?

<LI> Can I repay early without penalty?

<LI> How long will it take to get my application approved?

<LI> What's the most efficient way for me to make my loan payments?

<LI> Can the credit life insurance cover me and a co-applicant?

<LI> What kind of collateral, if any, is required to secure the loan?

<LI> How will different amortizations affect the total interest I pay?

<LI> Will the information I give you be kept confidential?

<LI> If my credit rating is unsatisfactory, what can I do to improve it?

<LI> What is the interest rate?

</OL><P>

<b><font size=+1>What to Do if You Run Into Trouble</font></b><br>

<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>



Despite their best intentions, people sometimes encounter problems in repaying their loans due to job loss, sickness, or family emergency.<P>



If you find it difficult to meet your financial obligations, the first thing to do is go to the financial institution that granted the loan and tell them about it.  Chances are, arrangements can be made to give you some breathing room.<P>



While you may find it difficult to tell your loans officer or branch manager you're having temporary problems, they can help you work out a plan that will get you through the difficult period.  You may wish to consider optional life or disability insurance which are available on most forms of credit.<P>

<img align=right hspace=5 src="house.gif">Since you bought your home, it may have increased in value and/or you may have substantially paid down your mortgage.  The Scotia Homeowner ADD-Vantage program gives you a low-cost<img align=top src="1.gif"> way to access the equity you have built up in your home<img align=top src="2.gif">, up to 75%<img align=top src="3.gif"> of its current value.<p><br clear=all>

With the Scotia Homeowner ADD-Vantage program, you normally pay a much lower interest rate and you can spread out your repayment over a longer, more convenient time frame as compared to other types of borrowing.<p>

Until now, refinancing a mortgage to access your equity could be very costly because of processing, legal and disbursement fees.  At Scotiabank, we have made special arrangements with legal and service firms to reduce costs and make the process easier... passing the savings on to you.  We handle all of the necessary paperwork, so you can expect a quick, hassle-free process.<p>

Our mortgage specialists can probably help you even if your mortgage is with another financial institution.  Simply bring your mortgage to Scotiabank, then add to it under our Scotia Homeowner ADD-Vantage program option.<p>

Remember the old saying "The best mortgage is NO mortgage"?  Here are some helpful hints that can help you save money and pay down your mortgage more quickly.

<p><br clear=all>



<center><img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br>

<b><font size=+1>Increase your payment frequency</font></b><br>

<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>

By making your mortgage payments on a weekly or bi-weekly basis instead of once a month, you can reduce the <a href="crmort6.htm">amortization period</a> of your mortgage.  Let's look at an example:  On a $100,000 mortgage with 8% interest, the monthly payment amount (principal and interest) is $763.21 amortized over 25 years. By making bi-weekly payments of $381.60 instead, your amortization is reduced to approximately 19 years.  In this example, you could be mortgage-free 6 years sooner by making weekly or bi-weekly payments.

<p>

<center><img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br>

<b><font size=+1>Decrease the amortization period of the mortgage</font></b><br>

<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>

The amortization period represents the actual number of years it takes to repay a mortgage loan in full.  A shorter amortization period produces an increased mortgage payment, which can result in your mortgage being repaid more quickly.<p>

By decreasing the amortization period, you can reap substantial interest savings over the life of your mortgage.  The table below shows this, by comparing the total interest paid over the life of a mortgage amortized over 25 years, versus the same mortgage amortized over 20 years.<p>

<Tr><Td>20 year amortization</Td>

<Td>$828.36</Td>

<Td>$98,806.40</Td></Tr>

</Table></center><br>

<Font Size=-1>* Interest is compounded semi-annually not in advance</Font><br>

<img align=left src="1.gif"><Font Size=-1>Calculations are approximate and are based upon: the interest rate being constant throughout the entire amortization period, and regularly scheduled payments being applied to the mortgage.</font>

<p>As you can see from the example, by paying $65.15 more in monthly mortgage payments you could save $30,156.60 in total interest paid over the amotization period of your mortgage.

<p>

<center><img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br>

<b><font size=+1>Take full advantage of prepayment privilages</font></b><br>

<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>



At Scotiabank, you can prepay up to 15% of the original amount of your mortgage anytime during each year of the term of your mortgage - without penalty or administration fee.<p>



You can also take advantage of our Match-A-Payment Option<Font Size=-1>TM</Font>, which allows you to pay an additional amount equal to your current mortgage payment of principal and interest (as well as insurance and taxes, if applicable) on any regular payment date.  You can match a payment once a year or once a month.  The choice is yours.  The full amount of the extra payment is taken directly off the principal of your mortgage.  It's a great way to reduce interest costs and pay off your mortgage sooner. 

<p>

<center><img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br>

<b><font size=+1>Make the largest downpayment possible when arranging your mortgage</font></b><br>

<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>



One of the most economical ways to save money on your mortgage is by making the largest <a href="crmort6.htm">downpayment</a> possible.  The larger the downpayment of your home, the smaller the amount of mortgage you will require.

</CENTER><p>

<dl>

<dt><b>Amortization Period</b>

<dd>The actual number of years it will take to repay a mortgage loan in full.  This can be well in excess of the loan's term.  For example, mortgages often have five year terms but 25 year amortization periods.<p>

<dt><b>Appraised Value</b>

<dd>The estimate of the value of the property offered as security for a mortgage loan.  This appraisal is done for mortgage lending purposes and may be less than the purchase price of the property.<p>

<dt><b>Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC)</b>

<dd>The Corporation of the Federal Government which administers the National Housing Act (NHA) and provides mortgage insurance to lenders.<p>

<dt><b>Closed and Open Mortgages</b>

<dd>A closed mortgage agreement does not provide for payout prior to maturity.  A lender may permit payout under certain circumstances but will levy a penalty charge for doing so if such exceeds certain limits, if any, specified in the mortgage (i.e. 15% prepayment provision).  An open mortgage allows prepayment / repayment at any time without penalty<p>

<dt><b>Closing Date</b>

<dd>The date on which the sale of the property becomes final and the new owner takes possession.<p>

<dt><b>Condominium</b>

<dd>A form of ownership in which the owner has title to a dwelling unit and also owns a share of the common elements (such as elevators, hallways and the land).<p>

<dt><b>Conventional Mortgage</b>

<dd>A mortgage loan which does not exceed 75% of the lesser of the appraised value or the purchase price of the property.  A mortgage that exceeds that limit must be insured under the practices of most major financial institutions.<p>

<dt><b>Debt Service Ratios (GDSR & TDSR)</b>

<dd>The Gross Debt Service Ratio (GDSR) is the percentage of gross annual income required to cover payments associated with housing (mortgage principal and interest, taxes, secondary financing, heating, and 50% of condominium fees, if any).  The GDSR should not exceed 32% of gross annual income.  The Total Debt Service Ratio (TDSR) is the percentage of gross annual income required to cover payments associated with housing (GDSR) and all other debts and obligations, such as payments on a car loan.  The TDSR ratio should not exceed 40% of gross income.  For self-employed / commission sales applicants, net income is used for GDSR and TDSR ratio calculations.<p>

<dt><b>Down Payment </b>

<dd>The amount of money (usually in the form of cash) put forward by the purchaser.  It represents the difference between the purchase price and the amount of the mortgage loan.<p>

<dt><b>Equity</b>

<dd>Equity is the difference if positive between the price for which a property could be sold and the total debts registered against it.<p>

<dt><b>Fixed Rate and Variable Rate Mortgages</b>

<dd>A fixed rate mortgage is one for which the rate of interest is fixed for a specific period of time (the term).  A variable rate mortgage is one for which the rate of interest changes as money market conditions change, usually not more than once a month.  The monthly payment stays the same for a specified period.  However, the amount applied towards the principal changes according to the change (if any) in the rate of interest.<p>

<dt><b>GEMICO</b>

<dd>General Electric Mortgage Insurance Company, a private mortgage insurer.<p>

<dt><b>High Ratio Mortgage</b>

<dd>A mortgage loan which exceeds 75% of the lesser of the appraised value or purchase price of the property.  This mortgage must be insured and borrowers must pay an application fee and the insurance premium (which may be added to the mortgage) to the insurer.<p>

<dt><b>Interest Adjustment Date (I.A.D.)</b>

<dd>A date, usually one month before monthly mortgage payments begin, when interest on monies advanced before that date is calculated and must be paid by the borrower.<p>

<dt><b>Leasehold Mortgage</b>

<dd>A mortgage loan on a home where the building is on land which is leased (rented).  The lender takes an interest in the lease.<p>

<dt><b>Loan-to-Value Ratio</b>

<dd>The ratio of the loan to the appraised value or purchase price of the property, whichever is less, expressed as a percentage.<p>

<dt><b>Maturity Date</b>

<dd>The last day of the term of the mortgage agreement.  The mortgage agreement must then be renewed or the mortgage balance paid in full.<p>

<dt><b>Mortgagee</b>

<dd>The lender.<p>

<dt><b>Mortgagor</b>

<dd>The borrower.<p>

<dt><b>National Housing Act (NHA) Loan</b>

<dd>A mortgage loan which is insured by CMHC.<p>

<dt><b>Offer to Purchase</b>

<dd>A formal, legal agreement which offers a certain price for a specified real property.  The offer may be firm (no conditions attached) or conditional (certain conditions must be fulfilled).<p>

<dt><b>P.I.T.</b>

<dd>Principal, Interest, and taxes.<p>

<dt><b>Prepayment Charge</b>

<dd>A fee charged by the lender when the borrower pays off all or a portion of a mortgage more quickly than provided for in the mortgage agreement.<p>

<dt><b>Refinance</b>

<dd>To arrange a new mortgage for an increased amount.  The old mortgage(s) is paid off (discharged) from the proceeds of the new loan.  This type of loan is also referred to as "equity take out."<p>

<dt><b>Renew</b>

<dd>To extend a mortgage agreement with the same lender for another term.  The length of the term and the conditions (such as the rate of interest) may be changed.<p>

<dt><b>Term</b>

<dd>The length of time which a mortgage agreement covers.  Payments made may not fully repay the outstanding principal by the end of the term, because the amortization period is longer.<p>

<i>The service fees noted above will not be paid by the Funds or the unitholders of the Funds.</i><p>

<b>Sales Incentive Programs</b><br>

<b>No charges for incentive programs will be paid by a Fund or its unitholders.</b>  Prizes, such as cash or merchandise, may be awarded in connection with sales of units of a Fund to individual employees or to Scotiabank, Montreal Trust or Scotiabank & Trust branches.  It is estimated that the cost of such prizes will not exceed the equivalent of $1 per $1,000 investment by a unitholder per year.  The maximum value of any prize that may be awarded to an individual employee is $1000.  Scotiabank and Montreal Trust may include sales of units of a Fund in their general employee incentive programs.<p>

<li>SCOTIA EXCELSIOR MORTGAGE FUND, like all mutual funds, is subject to market risks.  Both your original capital and the rate of income earned are not guaranteed.  Scotiabank guarantees to buy back mortgages from the Fund in the event of default.  Scotiabank does not guarantee your investment against market risk.  Monthly income, as it accrues to this Fund, is already contained in your quoted prices.

<li>CURRENT SIMPLIFIED PROSPECTUS -- You should read this carefully because it describes the nature of every Scotia Excelsior Fund investment, all related fees, your rights as a unitholder, and other essential information and it virtually overrides any other description you might be given at any time.

<FONT SIZE = +2><B>INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES<!--HEADING--></B></FONT><br>

<img VSPACE=5 vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>



<center><img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br>

<b><font size=+1>Money Market Funds</font></b><br>

<i>(to provide safety, liquidity and interest income)</i><br>

<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>



<b>Scotia Excelsior T-Bill Fund ("T-Bill Fund") and Scotia Excelsior Premium T-Bill Fund </b>("Premium T-Bill Fund") (previously named Scotia Government of Canada Treasury Bill Fund and Scotia Premium T-Bill Fund) invest in Government of Canada treasury bills with maturities of up to 364 days.  Premium T-Bill Fund accommodates larger investments starting with a minimum initial subscription of $100,000, consequently its management fee is lower than that of T-Bill Fund.<p>

<b>Scotia Excelsior Money Market Fund</b> ("Money Market Fund") (previously named Scotia Money Market Fund) invests in high quality short-term debt securities issued by the Government of Canada or any Canadian provincial or municipal government, obligations of Canadian chartered banks and trust companies, and high quality short-term corporate obligations.<p>

<i>All investments must be rated R-1 or better by Dominion Bond Rating Service or its equivalent as defined by other recognized rating agencies.</i><p>

<a name="income"></a><center><img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br>

<b><font size=+1>Income Funds</font></b><br>

<i>(to gain maximum return while minimizing risk to capital)</i><br>

<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>



<b>Scotia Excelsior Mortgage Fund</b> ("Mortgage Fund") (previously named Scotia Mortgage Fund) invests in high quality first mortgages on residential properties in Canada which are insured or guaranteed by the Government of Canada, any Canadian province, or any agency thereof, conventional first mortgages of real estate in Canada with loan-to-value ratios not exceeding 75% unless the excess is insured by an insurance company registered or licensed under federal or provincial legislation, and high quality debt securities of the Government of Canada or Canadian provincial or municipal governments, but not more than 25% of net assets may be invested at any time in these debt securities.  Scotiabank will purchase from the Fund any mortgage which is in default.<p>



<b>Scotia Excelsior Defensive Income Fund</b> ("Defensive Income Fund") (previously named Scotia Defensive Income Fund) invests primarily in Government of Canada bonds and treasury bills, provincial government bonds and money market instruments, bonds and money market instruments guaranteed by the Government of Canada or any Canadian province, bonds and money market instruments of Canadian corporations, commercial paper and bankers' acceptances rated R-1 or better, mortgage-backed securities, guaranteed investment certificates, bond coupons and cash.<p>



The average term to maturity of the portfolio fluctuates within a range of 6 months to 5 years, depending on prevailing interest rate forecasts.  The term to maturity of a particular asset of the portfolio never exceeds 5 years, or, in the case of guaranteed investment certificates, 3 years.<p>



<b>Scotia Excelsior Income Fund </b>("Income Fund") (previously named Scotia Income Fund) invests in high quality debt securities (primarily bonds and debentures of governments and corporations with a full range of maturity dates), and some mortgages and equity securities but no more than 10% of net assets may be invested at any time in equity securities and no more than 30% of net assets may be invested at any time in mortgages.<p>



<b>Scotia Excelsior Global Bond Fund</b> ("Global Bond Fund") (previously named Scotia Global Bond Fund) invests primarily in high quality government and corporate bonds from around the world, denominated in a variety of currencies to hedge against volatility in foreign exchange markets.<p>



<b>Scotia Excelsior Dividend Fund</b> ("Dividend Fund") (previously named Dividend Section, Montreal Trust Excelsior Fund) invests predominantly in various types of preferred shares (including floating rate, convertible, and retractable preferred shares) and dividend-paying common shares of Canadian issuers.<p>





<a name="equity"></a><center><img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br>

<b><font size=+1>Equity Funds</font></b><br>

<i>(for long-term capital growth)</i><br>

<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>



<b>Scotia Excelsior Canadian Blue Chip Fund</b> ("Canadian Blue Chip Fund") (previously named Scotia Canadian Equity Growth Fund) maintains a diversity of equity securities of Canadian companies listed on Canadian stock exchanges that are considered likely to benefit from prevailing and anticipated economic conditions.  Some high quality corporate paper and money market instruments may also be purchased.<p>



<b>Scotia Excelsior Canadian Growth Fund</b> ("Canadian Growth Fund") (previously named Equity Section, Montreal Trust Excelsior Fund) invests principally in common shares and other equity investments to provide the potential for long-term capital appreciation.<p>



<b>Scotia Excelsior American Equity Growth Fund</b> ("American Equity Growth Fund") (previously named Scotia American Equity Growth Fund) maintains a diversity of growth oriented foreign securities consisting largely of American equity securities.  Selection is based on the growth potential of the issuers under prevailing and anticipated economic conditions and on international currency considerations.  Some high quality corporate paper and money market instruments may also be purchased.<p>



<b>Scotia Excelsior International Fund</b> ("International Fund") (previously named International Section, Montreal Trust Excelsior Fund) invests principally in foreign securities, including common shares and other equity investments, as well as fixed income investments such as bonds, debentures and notes, to provide the potential for capital appreciation.<p>



<b>Scotia Excelsior Pacific Rim Fund</b> ("Pacific Rim Fund") (previously named Scotia Pacific Rim Fund) invests primarily in high quality listed equity securities, including listed closed end country funds, from the western portion of the Pacific Rim, including China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, Philippines, South Korea and Japan.  The Fund may also invest in selected high quality corporate debt obligations and money market instruments.  The Fund's portfolio will be denominated in a variety of currencies to hedge against volatility in foreign exchange markets.<p>



<b>Scotia Excelsior Latin American Fund</b> ("Latin American Fund") (previously named Scotia Latin American Fund) will invest primarily in high quality listed equity securities and listed closed end country funds from Latin America including Mexico, Argentine, Brazil, Venezuela, Peru, and Chile.  The Fund may also invest in selected high quality corporate debt obligations and money market instruments.  The Fund will hold securities denominated in a variety of currencies to reduce the risks of adverse effects resulting from volatility in foreign exchange markets.  Investors should realize that securities prices in Latin American markets may be significantly more volatile than in more developed nations of the world, reflecting the greater uncertainties and risks inherent in investing in less established markets and economies.<p>

<a name="special"></a><center><img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br>

<b><font size=+1>Specialty Funds</font></b><br>

<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>



<b>Scotia CanAm Income Fund</b> ("CanAm Income Fund")  invests primarily in high-quality debt securities and money market instruments of Canadian issuers and supranational entities which are denominated in U.S. dollars, consisting primarily of debt securities of Canadian federal, provincial or municipal governments or corporations, but also of debt securities of certain supranational entities (such as the World Bank) which do not constitute foreign property within the meaning of the Income Tax Act (Canada).<p>



The Manager exercises its discretion to identify high quality securities.  Money market instruments must be rated R1 or better by Dominion Bond Rating Service or its equivalent as defined by other recognized agencies.  The Fund may also invest in comparable securities of foreign issuers provided the Fund would not be liable for tax under the Income Tax Act (Canada) in respect of excessive holdings of foreign property.<p>



The average term to maturity of the portfolio fluctuates from time to time according to the judgement of the Manager and prevailing interest rate forecasts, although the average term to maturity of the portfolio does not exceed eight years and the term to maturity of any particular investment does not exceed 10 years.<p>



<b>Scotia CanAm Growth Fund</b> ("CanAm Growth Fund") maintains a combination of Standard and Poor's 500 Composite Stock Index ("S and P 500 Index") futures contracts and Government of Canada T-Bills in order to obtain a return in Canadian dollars similar to the S and P 500 Index.  To accomplish this, the Fund will purchase Government of Canada T-Bills and will pledge up to 10% of them to purchase, on margin, S and P 500 Index futures contracts sufficient to closely match the performance of the S and P 500 Index.  Since it will not use futures contracts for speculative trading or to create a portfolio that is leveraged, the Fund will always set aside sufficient cash or cash equivalents to satisfy the obligations of the futures contracts.<p>



<b>Scotia Excelsior Precious Metals Fund</b> ("Precious Metals Fund") (previously named Scotia Precious Metals Funds) invests primarily in precious metals (gold, silver, platinum and palladium) in the form of bullion, coins and certificates and other evidences of precious metals, and common shares or other securities of Canadian or foreign companies which are directly or indirectly involved in the exploration, mining or production of precious metals.  The Fund may also invest a small portion of its assets in securities of companies, the returns on which are connected in a significant way with the prices or trading of precious metals.<p>





<a name="balance"></a><center><img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br>

<b><font size=+1>Balanced Funds</font></b><br>

<i>(to gain a reasonable return and long-term capital appreciation consistent with safety of principal)</i><br>

<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>



<b>Scotia Excelsior Balanced Fund</b> ("Balanced Fund") (previously named Balanced Section, Montreal Trust Excelsior Fund) invests in a diversified portfolio of securities so as to achieve a consistent return to investors composed of a blend of capital gains, dividends and interest income.  Investments may include bonds, debentures, mortgages, common shares, preferred shares, warrants and money market instruments.<p>



<b>Scotia Excelsior Total Return Fund</b> ("Total Return Fund") (previously named Total Return Section, Montreal Trust Excelsior Fund) invests in a diversified portfolio of securities managed to react aggressively to opportunities for capital gains or investment income and, conversely, to take strong measures to avoid undue risk or low return for a particular security.  Conceived principally with aggressive long-term investors in mind, this Fund pursues opportunities within the Canadian and international financial markets which are expected to provide investors, through a high combination of capital gains, dividends and interest income, with the highest possible total return on investment that is consistent with a moderate level of risk.<p>



Both the <b>Balanced</b> and <b>Total Return Funds</b> may invest in foreign securities up to the maximum percentage permitted by Canadian tax legislation without causing the Fund to become foreign property for RRSPs, RRIFs, DPSPs and other registered accounts.<p>

<a name="deriv"></a><center><img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br>

<b><font size=+1>Derivatives</font></b><br>

<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>

The Scotia Excelsior Funds, except Balanced Fund, Total Return Fund, Canadian Growth Fund, Dividend Fund and International Fund, may use or invest in derivative instruments consistent with their investment objectives and as permitted by Canadian securities regulators.  The Funds may use derivatives to hedge against certain investment risks, such as currency and interest rate fluctuations and stock market volatility.  The Funds may also invest in derivatives for non-hedging purposes, such as creating exposure to domestic and international financial markets, investing in financial market downturns and facilitating and reducing the cost of portfolio transactions.  Each of Balanced Fund, Total Return Fund, Canadian Growth Fund, Dividend Fund and International Fund will not use derivatives until appropriate notice to unitholders is provided.<p>

The Funds may use derivatives only if enough cash or securities are available to cover positions.  Furthermore, a Fund may use derivatives for non-hedging purposes only to the extent that no more than 10% of its assets consists of such instruments.  The Funds may not use derivatives for speculative trading or to create a portfolio with excessive leverage.<p>

CanAm Growth Fund will invest in futures contracts to create exposure to the equity performance of the S and P 500 Index.  Precious Metals Fund may use derivatives for hedging purposes and to enhance the Fund's performance.  CanAm Income Fund, Defensive Income Fund, Income Fund, Money Market Fund, Mortgage Fund and Global Bond Fund may use bond futures or other derivatives for hedging purposes.  Canadian Blue Chip Fund, American Equity Growth Fund, Pacific Rim Fund and Latin American Fund may use listed equity futures or other derivatives for hedging purposes.  Investing in or using derivatives is subject to certain risks.  Reference is made to "<A HREF="prosp.htm#risk">Risk Factors</a>."

<img VSPACE=5 src="line.gif">

</CENTER><p>



When most people think of borrowing money from a bank, they think of a simple term loan that's repaid over a set period of time with fixed monthly installments.  Today, most financial institutions offer a much wider selection of borrowing options that affect the interest paid, the repayment period, and the total cost of the loan -- allowing you to choose the borrowing option that's right for you.<P>

Click here to access the <a href="http://www.scotiabank.ca/cgi-bin/loancalc.cgi">Scotiabank Personal Loan Payment Calculator</a>.<p>



<center><img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br>

<b><font size=+1>The emphasis today is on flexibility</font></b><br>

<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>



A loan should fit your needs and financial circumstances.<P>



You'll find loans available on a secured and unsecured basis.  Security can be in the form of a car, home, or other assets.  Secured loans are usually available for larger amounts than unsecured loans, and the interest rate is usually lower.<P>



Remember that making lump sum prepayments and reducing the amortization period of the loan will ultimately save you money by reducing the interest charges.<P>



As with other forms of credit, you should consider your needs, financial status and ability to repay before taking a personal loan.<P>



<center><img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br>

<b><font size=+1>In some cases, borrowing may be better than leasing</font></b><br>

<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>



Although automobile leasing has become popular in recent years, you should compare all your options to determine whether borrowing or leasing is best for your needs.  Your bank representative can help you with this.<P>



<center><img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br>

<b><font size=+1>Scotia Plan Loans are simple to apply for and to repay</font></b><br>

<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>

<ul>

<li>Scotia Plan<font size=-2>&reg;</font> Loans can help you make any worthwhile consumer purchase -- a car, a vacation, <a href="RRSPCentre.html">RRSP</a> contributions or debt consolidation, for example.

<li>Unsecured loans usually up to $25,000.

<li>Fully secured loans generally available up to $150,000, with interest rates dependent on the type of security and the <a href="glossary.htm#term">term</a> of the loan.

<li>Are available for <a href="glossary.htm#term">terms</a> of from 1 to 5 years.

<li>Monthly payments arranged to suit your budget.

<li>Payments deducted automatically from your account with the monthly payment date set to suit your circumstances.

<li> Various <a href="glossary.htm#amortization">amortizations</a> are available depending upon security.

<li>Credit life and disability insurance which can cover the full amount of your loan in case of accident, illness or death.  A small price to pay for complete protection.

The Scotia Student Loan program provides assistance to Canadian students who require financing to continue their education.  The program was designed specifically for students who do not qualify for the federal and provincial student loan plans.<p>



<center><img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br>
<b><font size=+1>Who is eligible?</font></b><br>
<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>
You can apply for a Scotia Student Loan if you are a Canadian citizen or a landed immigrant.  You must be enrolled in a full-time public, not-for-profit Canadian post-secondary institution acceptable to us that offers recognized degrees and diplomas.  You must also be enrolled in a program that is two or more years in duration and is leading to a post-secondary degree or diploma.  You are not eligible if you have a government or other financial institution student loan for the same academic year.<P>

<center><img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br>
<b><font size=+1>Now you can apply for a student loan on-line!</font></b><br>
<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>
Click on the "Apply Here" button at the bottom of the page to access our on-line Scotia Student Loan application.  You can complete this application and e-mail it directly to us at our National Student Loan Centre.  Your information will be transmitted securely and will only be read by a Scotiabank loans officer.  We will provide a response within 2 business days.<P>

<center><img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br>
<b><font size=+1>How else can I apply?</font></b><br>
<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>
Details of the program and application forms are available in Canada at all Scotiabank branches, or you can call our National Student Loan Centre toll-free at <b>1-800-9-SCOTIA</b> (1-800-972-6842) (416-288-4655 in Metro Toronto) or send us an <a href="email.htm">e-mail</a>.  If you are approved for a loan, we'll send you detailed information.  Then go to any <a href="scolocat.htm">Scotiabank branch</a> to arrange for the funds to be deposited into your <a href="pbssba.htm">Student Banking Advantage</a> account.  Just provide the appropriate proof of enrollment and the money is yours.<P>
<p>

<center><img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br>
<b><font size=+1>How much can I borrow?</font></b><br>
<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>
With a Scotia Student Loan full-time undergraduates can borrow up to $6,000 for each academic year, to a maximum of $24,000 if a parental guarantee is provided (lower limits are available without a guarantee).  If you are a graduate student or studying to be a professional, you can borrow up to $6,000 a year to a maximum of $36,000 for all post-secondary studies.  In most cases a parental guarantee will be required.  You will receive each year's loan advance in two installments, payable in September and January. Note: Scotia Student Loans are available only for full-time students.<P>

<center><img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br>
<b><font size=+1>What will be the interest rate?</font></b><br>
<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>
The interest rate is fixed each year for one year and is competitive.  And if you have a parental guarantee, the interest rate on your loan will be lower still.  Find out the current interest rates by calling <b>1-800-9-SCOTIA</b> (1-800-972-6842) (416-288-4655 in Metro Toronto) or by visiting any <a href="scolocat.htm">Scotiabank branch</a>.<P>


<center><img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br>
<b><font size=+1>What about paying back the loan?</font></b><br>
<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>
Monthly interest-only payments are required while at school.<P>

<center><img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br>
<b><font size=+1>And when I graduate?</font></b><br>
<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>
We know that getting a job could take a while. We give you an automatic six-month grace period before regular repayment of principal and interest of your loan begins.  If you still haven't found a job, we may extend the grace period up to 12 months.<P>

While you are job-hunting, you will be expected to continue paying the interest on your loan.  This way, you have a total of up to 10 years to repay -- or 11 years if you take advantage of the full grace period. Remember: If you feel that you may have problems in repayment, keep us informed. We can solve them together.<P>

With a GIC, the rate of return is guaranteed for the term of the investment, so you
don't need to worry about how market fluctuations might affect your
investment.<p>

Redeemable GICs can be cashed at any time. While this flexibility is an attractive
feature -- especially if you need money in an emergency -- redeemable GICs pay a lower
rate of interest than non-redeemable GICs and usually an even lower rate is paid if
you decide to redeem them before maturity. <p>

Non-redeemable GICs cannot be cashed before their maturity date, but they generally
yield a higher return because the funds are locked in. You can also purchase in Canada
non-redeemable GICs in U.S. dollars. <p>

From time to time Scotiabank makes available promotional GICs with additional
features, such as convertible or cashable options or non-standard terms with special
rates, such as 18 months. Ask at your branch for details of any promotional GICs that
might be available. <p>

<b><font size=+1>Investment Restrictions</font></b><br>

<img VSPACE=5 vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>





The Funds have adopted the standard investment restrictions and practices prescribed in National Policy No. 39 by the Canadian Securities Administrators which are deemed to be incorporated into this document, except in the case of Precious Metals Fund, where the restrictions on a mutual fund's ability to invest in gold and gold certificates and to buy and sell commodities do not apply. Mortgage Fund has adopted additional restrictions prescribed by the Canadian Securities Administrators which apply to mutual funds that invest in mortgages. You may obtain copies of these investment restrictions and practices by writing to the Manager.<p>

<b><font size=+1>History of the Funds</font></b><br>

<img VSPACE=5 vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>



Scotia Securities recently received all unitholder and regulatory approvals required to facilitate the integration of the operations of the Scotia Mutual Funds and the eight Sections constituting the Montreal Trust  Excelsior Fund effective October 1, 1995.  Each of the Sections adopted a new amended and restated declaration of trust with the result that each would operate as a separate mutual fund trust and not as Sections of Montreal Trust Excelsior Fund (formally Montreal Trust Investment Fund) and each adopted a changed name using the words "Scotia Excelsior".  Effective October 1, 1995, Scotia Stock & Bond Fund merged with International Fund, Montreal Trust Excelsior Fund -- Money Market Section merged with Money Market Fund, Montreal Trust Excelsior Fund -- Mortgage Section merged with Mortgage Fund, and Montreal Trust Excelsior Fund -- Income Section merged with Income Fund. As a result of the mergers the assets of the Balanced Fund were increased by approximately $58,000,000, the assets of the International Fund were increased by approximately $32,000,000, the assets of the Money Market Fund were increased by $91,000,000, the assets of the Mortgage Fund were increased by $115,000,000 and the assets of the Income Fund were increased by approximately $88,000,000.<p>



Scotia Excelsior Funds are open-end mutual fund trusts governed under the laws of Ontario pursuant to declarations of trust. The following Funds were originally established as of the dates indicated below:<p>

<b><font size=+1>What are Units of the Funds?</font></b><br>

<img VSPACE=5 vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>



</center>

Each unit of a Fund is an equal undivided interest in the assets of the Fund and ranks equally with all other units of the Fund with respect to income distributions and asset liquidation of the Fund. Each Fund is authorized to issue an unlimited number of units. You have the right to exercise one vote for each unit you own at all unit holder meetings. Each Fund is also authorized to issue fractional units.  Fractional units carry the rights and privileges and are subject to the restrictions and conditions of units in the proportions which they bear to one unit, except that any holder of a fractional unit is not entitled to vote in respect of such fractional unit.<p>



<a name="value"></a><center><img VSPACE=5 vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br>

<b><font size=+1>How are Units Valued?</font></b><br>

<img VSPACE=5 vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>





The value of a unit is called the net asset value ("NAV") per unit . The NAV per unit for all Funds is determined as of the close of trading on The Toronto Stock Exchange on each day the Exchange is open for trading unless the Funds have declared a suspension of the NAV determination. The NAV per unit of each Fund represents the then current market value of all assets of the Fund less any liabilities divided by the total number of units of the Fund outstanding. The CanAm Income Fund NAV per unit is determined in U.S. dollars. For more information you should read "<a href="prosp.htm#value">How the Units are Valued</a>" in the annual information form.<p>



The Manager expects the value of units of T-Bill Fund, Premium T-Bill Fund and Money Market Fund to be maintained at the issue price of $10.00 per unit (see "<a href="prosp.htm#dist">Distributions of the Funds</a>").<p>

<b><font size=+1>How to Invest in the Funds</font></b><br>

<img VSPACE=5 vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>





Units are offered at their NAV next determined after receipt of your purchase order.

<p>

<a name="howreg"></a><b>Regular Investments</b><br>



You will pay no sales commissions or other fees on your purchase of units and there are no deferred sales charges.<p>



Your order may be placed directly with Scotia Securities Inc. ( Scotia Securities ) Scotia Discount Brokerage Inc. or ScotiaMcLeod Inc. in those provinces and territories where Scotia Securities, Scotia Discount Brokerage Inc. or ScotiaMcLeod Inc. is registered with dealers and brokers qualified in your province or territory or with Scotia Securities representatives at branches of Scotiabank, Montreal Trust, and Scotiabank & Trust.<p>



Your dealer or broker must transmit your order to purchase or sell units to a Fund wherever practical by courier priority post or telecommunications facility without charge to you on the same day your completed order is received.  As a security policy (which may be changed at the discretion of the Manager), the Funds will not accept orders placed by telephone or wire directly by an investor.<p>



Your order will be forwarded to the Fund for acceptance or rejection and the Fund reserves the right to reject any order in whole or in part. The decision to accept or reject your order will be made promptly and, in any event, within two days of its receipt by the Fund. If your order is rejected your money will be returned to you immediately.<p>



The minimum purchase amounts are set out below. The amounts may be varied or waived at any time without notice at the discretion of the Manager. Further, the Manager reserves the right to terminate your account with a Fund if the net asset value of your investment in the Fund drops below the applicable minimum for an initial purchase.<p>

<a name="howpay"></a><b>Payment</b><br>

Payment for all orders must be received by the Funds on or before the fifth business day from (but not including) the day the purchase price for the units so ordered is determined.  Where payment is not so received, a Fund is deemed to have received and accepted on the first business day following such period an order for redemption of the units and the redemption proceeds are applied to reduce the purchase price owing to the Fund.  lf the amount of the redemption proceeds exceeds the purchase price of the units the Fund is permitted to retain the excess. If the amount of the redemption proceeds is less than the issue price of the units, Scotia Securities, as principal distributor of the Funds must pay the Fund the shortfall.  Scotia Securities is entitled to collect the shortfall and its costs, charges and expenses in so doing and interest thereon from dealers or brokers placing the purchase order. Where no dealers or brokers have been involved, Scotia Securities is entitled to collect such amounts from the investor who has failed to pay for the units ordered.<p>



CanAm Income Fund Currency Option --You may pay for units of this Fund in either Canadian or United States dollars. If you pay in Canadian dollars your payment must accompany your purchase order and will be converted into United States dollars at the Scotiabank daily "sell" exchange rate on the day the purchase order is received by the Fund.<p>



<a name="howtoo"></a><b>"Pay Yourself Too Plan"</b><br>



You can set up an automatic investment plan for investment in any of the Funds for at least the purchase amounts indicated under "How to Invest in the Funds". You select the frequency of your purchases, which may be monthly, quarterly, semi-annually or annually (or such other frequency as may be made available by the Manager, by preauthorizing payments from your chequing account at Scotiabank or any other major Canadian financial institution. By written notice to the Fund you may change the amount of each purchase or the frequency of purchase or you may discontinue the plan at any time without penalty. "Pay Yourself Too Plan" forms used to open an automatic investment plan can be obtained when you place your order at branches of Scotiabank, Montreal Trust or Scotiabank & Trust.<p>



<a name="howauto"></a><b>Scotia AutoPilot Service</b><br>



You may set up a Scotia Autopilot account in which your investment is divided on a percentage basis, which you select, among a variety of the Funds and is automatically maintained at these percentages. To qualify for this service the minimum value of your investment in your Autopilot account must be no less than $10,000, subject to the investment allocated to any one of the Funds in your Autopilot account being maintained above the Fund's minimum initial purchase requirements. The service will automatically calculate the total market value of your Autopilot account as of the last business day of each calendar quarter, or more frequently as may be determined by the Manager, then reallocate your investments to match the allocation percentages you have specified. For subsequent investments you must indicate the Fund(s) in which your investments will be made. You may change your allocation for subsequent calendar quarters free of charge by informing the Manager, in writing, of the new allocation selected by the end of the second last business day of the current calendar quarter.  Reallocations arising from subsequent purchases or redemptions or your request to change an allocation will take effect upon the last business day of the current calendar quarter. You will pay no commission, fees or charges upon the quarterly reallocation of assets in your Autopilot account.  A unitholder may realize tax consequences on the reallocation of assets in an autopilot account.  You should read "<a href="prosp.htm#tax">Tax Considerations</a>".  All Funds except Premium T-Bill Fund, Balanced Fund, Total Return Fund and CanAm Income Fund, are eligible for your Scotia Autopilot account.<p>

Please note that an Autopilot account does not monitor the foreign content of your investment in Scotia Excelsior Funds (see "<a href="prosp.htm#howfor">Foreign Content Monitoring Service for Registered Accounts</a>").<p>



Because an Autopilot Account is intended as an asset accumulation and not a withdrawal service it is not available for Funds which are part of RRIFs, LRIFs and LIRAs.<p>



The Manager may, in its sole discretion, accept other Funds as eligible for Autopilot accounts. The Manager also reserves the right to discontinue providing you with this service should the total net asset value of your investments in your Autopilot account decline below $10,000, or such other amount as the Management may in its sole discretion select.<p>



<a name="howrrsp"></a><b>RRSP, RRIF and Other Registered Accounts</b><br>



You will pay no administration or other fees if you open a Scotia RRSP, RRIF, LRIF or LIRA.<p>



You may open Scotia RRSP, RRIF, LRIF or LIRA accounts for units of all Funds (See <a href="prosp.htm#howfor">Foreign Content Monitoring Service</a>, below).  Minimum initial and subsequent contributions for a Scotia RRSP, RRIF, LRIF or LIRA account are as follows:<p>

Units of the Funds may also be held in a self-directed RRSP, RRIF, LRIF or LIRA,with any other financial institution as may be approved by the Manager but such plans may be subject to fees.<p>



You may open a Scotia RRSP, RRIF, LRIF or LIRA account by completing an application form and declaration of trust which you may obtain directly from branches of Scotiabank, Montreal Trust or Scotiabank & Trust or from the offices of a sub-distributor appointed by Scotia Securities in certain provinces and territories.<p>



For more information you should read "Using Your Investment for Tax Planning Purposes" in the annual information form and consult with your tax adviser.<p>





<a name="howfor"></a><b>Foreign Content Monitoring Service For Registered Accounts</b><br>



When you hold units of Funds in a Scotia Excelsior Funds RRSP, RRIF, LRIF or LIRA account, our Foreign Content Monitoring Service will automatically ensure that the book value of your account's portfolio does not exceed the 20% foreign content limit under current income tax legislation. If, prior to month end, your Scotia Excelsior Funds RRSP, RRIF, LRIF or LIRA account contains more than the allowable 20% our computer system will automatically redeem a portion of your foreign content Funds and purchase additional units of a fully RRSP, RRIF, LRIF or LIRA eligible Canadian content Fund of your choice to ensure that the 20% limit is not exceeded.  Where a Canadian content Fund is not selected, units of T-Bill Fund will be purchased. The Foreign Content Monitoring Service eliminates the possibility that your registered account might otherwise be subject to a tax penalty of 1% per month on any excess foreign content. For Scotia Excelsior Funds Autopilot RRSP accounts, the Foreign Content Monitoring Service will override any Autopilot allocation, if such allocation results in the account exceeding the foreign content limit.<p>

<b><font size=+1>How to Redeem an Investment</font></b><br>

<img VSPACE=5 vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>





You may redeem all or a portion of you units for their NAV next determined after receipt of your sell order.<p>



You may place a sell order in the same way as you place a purchase order.  See "<a href="prosp.htm#how">How to Invest in the Funds</a>".<p>



Your sell order must be in writing and bear an authorized signature from your bank, trust company or investment dealer and such other evidence of proper authority as a Fund may reasonably require.  Any sell order by a corporation, trust, partnership, agent, fiduciary, surviving joint owner or estate must be accompanied by customary documentation evidencing the signatory's authority and is effective only when all documentaton is received by the Fund in good order.<p>



If a unitholder fails to provide a Fund with a duly completed sell order within ten business days of the date on which the NAV was determined for purposes of the sell order, the Fund is deemed to have received and accepted on the next business day an order for the purchase of the same number of units being redeemed and will apply the redemption proceeds to pay the purchase price of such units.  If the purchase price is less than the redemption proceeds, the Fund is permitted to retain the excess.  If the purchase price exceeds the redemption proceeds, Scotia Securities, as principal distributor of the Funds, must pay the Fund the shortfall.  Scotia Securities is entitled to collect the shortfall and its costs, charges and expenses in so doing and interest thereon from dealers or brokers placing the sell order.  Where no dealers or brokers have been involved, Scotia Securities is entitled to collect such amounts from the investor who has failed to provide the sell order.<p>



Proceeds from the redemption of your units will be issued from the Funds to you within five business days after receipt of the completed sale documents by the Funds.  If the calculation of NAV is suspended, with, where necessary, the prior consent of the Ontario Securities Commission, your right to have your units purchased by the Funds is similarly suspended, and if your sell order is not withdrawn from deposit before the end of the suspension period, your units will be redeemed by the Funds in accordance with your sell order at the NAV next calculated following the end of the suspension.<p>



<i>CanAm Income Fund Currency Option</i><br>

Redemption proceeds for units of this Fund will be in United States dollars, unless you request in writing to receive payment in Canadian dollars.  If you request payment in Canadian dollars, amounts will be converted from United States dollars at the Scotiabank daily "buy" exchange rate on the day your order was received.<p>



The Funds do not charge for redemptions, but reserve the right to impose redemption fees from time to time, upon providing unitholders 60 days written notice of the amount and other particulars of such fee.  The Funds currently have no intention to impose such fees during the next 12 months.<p>



<a name="redaut"></a><b>Automatic Withdrawal Plan</b><br>

You may establish an automatic withdrawal plan (in United States or Canadian dollars in the case of CanAm Income Fund) under which sufficient units of a Fund will be redeemed on a periodic basis in order to provide you with a pre-designated regular payment.  To establish and maintain the plan, the following minimum initial NAVs for you investment and withdrawal amounts apply, which may be varied or waived at any time without notice at the absolute discretion of the Manager:<p>



<table border>

<font size=-1>** Or the U.S. Dollar equivalent in the case of CanAm Income Fund</font><p>



Your automatic withdrawal plan may be amended or terminated without charge upon receipt of written notice by the Fund.  A unitholder may realize tax consequences on any redemption or other transfer of units.  You should read "<a href="prosp.htm#tax">Tax Considerations</a>".  Please note that automatic withdrawal plans are not available for RRSP and other Registered Accounts.<p>



Under a withdrawal plan, if regular withdrawals are in excess of distributions other than capital distributions, these withdrawals will encroach on or exhaust the capital you have invested.<p>



<a name="dist"></a><center><img VSPACE=5 vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br>

<b><font size=+1>Distributions by the Funds</font></b><br>

<img VSPACE=5 vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>

You should take into account that distributions by the Funds will be made to unitholders of the Funds as of specified dates ("record dates").  The Manager may take other distributions to unitholders at its discretion.<p>



Net income is distributed by the Funds on the last business day of the periods identified below to unitholders of record on the second last business day of these periods, as follows:<p>

<ul>

<li>Monthly for T-Bill Fund, Premium T-Bill Fund, Money Market Fund, Mortgage Fund, Defensive Income Fund, Income Fund, CanAm Income Fund and Global Bond Fund;



<li>Quarterly for Dividend Fund, Balanced Fund and Total Return Fund; and



<li>Annually for Canadian Blue Chip Fund, Canadian Growth Fund, American Equity Growth Fund, CanAm Growth Fund, International Fund, Latin American Fund, Pacific Rim Fund and Precious Metals Fund.

</ul>

<p>



For all Funds net realized capital gains (reduced by loss carry forwards), if any, are distributed on the last day of each calendar year to unitholders of record at the close of business on the second last business day of such year.<p>



Distributions will be reinvested in additional units based on the NAV at that time.  In lieu of reinvestment, you may request, in writing, to receive cash distributions by cheque to you or by deposit to your bank account at Scotiabank.  Unitholders who held units of Montreal Trust Excelsior Fund prior to October 1, 1995 and were receiving all distributions in cash, will continue to do so.<p>



You may receive cash distributions from CanAm Income Fund in either Canadian or United States dollars.  Unless you request in writing to receive distributions in Canadian dollars, distributions will be made in United States dollars.  If you choose to receive distributions in Canadian dollars, amounts will be converted from United States dollars at the Scotiabank daily "buy" exchange rate on the day the distribution is made.<p>



Details of distributions paid by the Funds can be found in the financial statements of the Funds.

<b>The Manager</b><br>

Scotia Securities (the "Manager") is responsible for the overall management of the business and affairs of the Funds pursuant to management agreements with each of the Funds (the "Management Agreements").  The Management Agreements provide that the Manager may engage agents to perform administrative functions on behalf of the Funds, and engage brokers or dealers in connection with the investment portfolio transactions of the Funds.  The Management Agreements for Money Market Fund, Defensive Income Fund, Income Fund, Canadian Blue Chip Fund and American Equity Growth Fund may be terminated by either party on six months prior notice.  The Management Agreements for T-Bill Fund, Premium T-Bill Fund, Mortgage Fund, CanAm Income Fund, Dividend Fund, Canadian Growth Fund, CanAm Growth Fund, International Fund, Global Bond Fund, Pacific Rim Fund, Latin American Fund, Precious Metals Fund, Balanced Fund and Total Return Fund may be terminated upon sixty days notice by the Manager or after a unitholders' meeting approving the termination.<p>

<a name="maninv"></a>

<b>Investment Advisers</b><br>

Scotia Securities has engaged Scotia Investment Management Ltd. ("SIML") to provide investment advice to the Funds, other than Dividend Fund, Canadian Growth Fund, International Fund, Total Return Fund and Balanced Fund for which Montrusco Associates Inc. ("Montrusco") provides investment advice.  SIML, a wholly owned subsidiary of Scotiabank, is a Canadian professional investment and portfolio management form established in 1988 which actively manages private and corporate investment portfolios, pension funds and other segregated funds on a fully discretionary basis.  Montrusco, a subsidiary of Scotiabank, has provided investment management services to some of the Funds since 1985.  Both SIML and Montrusco have the authority, subject to the direction of Scotia Securities, to give instructions to purchase and sell securities of the Funds in accordance with the investment objectives and restrictions of the Funds.<p>

<a name="manexp"></a>

<b>Expenses and Fees</b><br>

All expenses are paid by the Funds except for management services in conjunction with investment advice, the daily operations of the Funds, and expenses relating to the sale of units.  The expenses directly paid by the Funds include commissions and brokerage fees on the purchase and sale of portfolio securities, taxes, charges for registry and transfer agency services, dividend crediting services, interest expenses, audit and legal fees, custodianship charges, and costs of preparing and sending annual and semi-annual reports and other required information to unitholders.  Mortgage Fund will pay Scotia Mortgage Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Scotiabank, a fee for administering all mortgages held by Mortgage Fund equal to and annualized rate of 3/8 of 1% of the average NAV of such mortgages.<p>



The Manager receives management fees equal to or less than the following annualized percentages of the NAV of each Fund.  Management fees are calculated and payable daily.  Unitholders will be given 60 days notice before the effective date of any increases in management fees or other expenses as payable by the Funds.

<p>

The Manager may agree to rebate to certain investors in the Funds a portion of the management fees it receives with respect to their investments.  These rebates can be negotiated between the Manager and such investors.  They are paid by the Manager and not by the Fund, and are settled through the purchase of additional units for the accounts of those receiving the rebates.  The rebates are intended to attract large investments which otherwise might not be invested in the Funds.  (This benefits the Funds and the Manager because administration costs for each dollar invested in the Funds are lower for larger investments.)  For example, an employer who decides to invest its group RRSP or Pension Plan monies in the Funds may negotiate a rebate which would benefit participating employees.  The Manager may discontinue these rebates at any time upon written notice to the investor or unitholder.  A rebate to an investor of the management fees paid by a Fund will increase tax consequences for the Fund (please read "Tax Considerations").  The Manager has agreed to indemnify each of the Funds against any tax liabilities which arise as a result of the rebates.<p>



The Funds are required to pay federal goods and services tax ("GST") on the fees which they pay to the Manager, as well as on most other goods and services they acquire.<p>

<b>Dealer Compensation</b><br>

The Manager may compensate any sub-distributor appointed by Scotia Securities for any units sold by its sales staff by regular payments based on the NAV of units sold.

From time to time prizes, such as cash or merchandise, may be awarded in connection with sales of units of the Funds to individual employees or to Scotiabank, Montreal Trust or Scotiabank & Trust branches to be distributed to, or used for the general benefit of branch employees.  It is estimated that the cost of such prizes will not exceed the equivalent of $1.00 per $1,000 investment by a unitholder per year.  The maximum value of any prize that may be awarded to an individual employee is $1000.  All costs will be paid by either Scotia Securities, Scotiabank or Montreal Trust.  Scotiabank or Montreal Trust may also include sales of units of the Funds in its general employee incentive programs which involve many different Scotiabank or Montreal Trust products.<p>



Subject to receipt of any necessary approvals of the relevant Canadian securities regulators, Scotia Securities, Scotiabank and Montreal Trust may from time to time offer other incentive programs.<p>



<b>No charges for incentive programs will be paid by the Funds or unitholders of the Funds.</b><p>



Under applicable securities regulations it is the obligation of the distributing dealer and its sales representatives to advise as to the suitability of the purchase of a security by the client investor having regard to the investor's investment objectives and risk tolerance, regardless of the compensation payable or on behalf of the fund sponsor or the investor.<p>



<a name="risk"></a><center><img VSPACE=5 vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br>

<b><font size=+1>Risk Factors</font></b><br>

<img VSPACE=5 vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>



The value of your investment in the Funds will vary with prevailing market conditions.  Fluctuations in the value of the investment portfolio of a Fund will affect the NAV of your units and, therefore, there is no assurance as to the amount of your investment which will be returned to you on a disposition of your units.<p>



General market conditions including the level of interest rates and other domestic and foreign economic factors will affect the interest income generated by the Money Market and Income Funds.  The values of the Income Funds tend to fluctuate inversely in relation to fluctuations in interest rates.  Because CanAm Income Fund invests in securities denominated in United States dollars, fluctuations in the exchange rate between the United States dollar and the Canadian dollar will affect the value of securities in its portfolio (and the unrealized appreciation or depreciation of investments) so far as Canadian investors are concerned.<p>



Certain investments of Global Bond Fund, International Fund, Balanced Fund, Total Return Fund, Pacific Rim Fund and Latin American Fund could be affected by political or social events or diplomatic developments in respect of the countries in whose companies the Fund invests (including the imposition of currency and exchange controls).  These Funds may also be affected by adverse legal developments in those countries.  Some foreign stock exchanges can be less liquid and are less regulated than North American stock exchanges.<p>



Precious Metals Fund is subject to certain risks.  Gold and other precious metals are subject to significant price movements as a result of international monetary and political factors, such as changing supply and demand relationships, government intervention in certain markets and changes in interest rates, and speculation.  Investments in precious metals earn no income and must be traded to realize gains.  Precious metals are traded in United States dollars.<p>



Each of the Funds (except Balanced Fund, Total Return Fund, Canadian Growth Fund, Dividend Fund and International Fund) may use various derivatives for hedging purposes.  Hedging instruments are imperfect tools because they rely on historical or anticipated correlations to predict the impact of certain events which may or may not occur, and if they occur, may not have the predicted effects.  A successful currency hedge precludes gains from a rise in the value of the hedged currency.  Currency fluctuations of certain smaller emerging growth countries are difficult to hedge against because of limited market size.  It is also difficult to hedge against trends which the market has already anticipated.  Currency hedging provides no protection against changes in the value of the underlying securities.<p>



CanAm Growth Fund will invest in futures contracts to create exposure to United States equity market performance.  Precious Metals Fund may use derivatives relating to precious metals to attempt to enhance the performance of the Fund.  There can be no assurance that liquid exchanges or markets for derivatives will always exist.  Failure of such an exchange or market could make it difficult to close out positions to realize gains or limit losses.  At worst, a Fund might face losses from having to exercise underlying futures contracts.  Prices of stock index options and some futures contracts can be distorted if trading in certain stocks comprising the derivative is halted.  Trading in the derivative might be interrupted in the unlikely event that trading was halted in a substantial number of the underlying stocks.  This situation might make it difficult for the Fund to close out positions.<p>

<b><font size=+1>Tax Considerations</font></b><br>

<img VSPACE=5 vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>



In the opinion of McCarthy T&eacute;trault, tax counsel of the Funds, the following summarizes the principal Canadian federal income tax considerations generally applicable to the Funds and their Canadian resident unitholders who hold their units as capital property.  The summary is based on the provisions of the Income Tax Act (Canada) (the "Tax Act"), the regulations made under the Tax Act (the "Regulations"), publicly announced proposals to amend the Tax Act and the Regulations and counsel's understanding of the current published administrative and assessing practices of Revenue Canada, Customs, Excise and Taxation.  This summary is not exhaustive of all possible income tax considerations and is based upon the Funds qualifying as mutual fund trusts in accordance with the conditions prescribed in the Tax Act at all material times.  The Funds expect that they will continue to so qualify.  Prospective purchasers of units are advised to consult their own tax adviser about their particular circumstances.<p>

<a name="taxfund"></a>

<b>Funds</b><br>

Each Fund will distribute to its unitholders in each year its net income and net realized capital gains, if any, to such an extent that it will not be liable in any year for income tax under Part 1 of the Tax Act.  Capital or income losses incurred by a Fund cannot be allocated to unitholders but may, subject to certain limitations, be deducted by the Fund from capital gains or net income realized in subsequent years.<p>

<a name="taxdist"></a>

<b>Tax on Distributions</b><br>

If you are not tax exempt, you must include in your income all net income and net taxable capital gains, if any, payable to you in a year, whether paid in cash or by reinvestment in additional units.  Income of a Fund for tax purposes will include the amount of any rebate of management fees credited to unitholders' accounts (see "Deemed Income from Rebates").  To the extent that distributions by a Fund in any year exceed the net income and the net realized capital gains of the Fund for the year, such distributions will be a return of capital and will not be taxable but will reduce the adjusted cost base of your units.  Each Fund will designate, to the extent permitted by the Tax Act, such part of the net income distributed to you as may reasonably be considered to have been derived from the taxable dividends received by you in the year from taxable Canadian corporations.  This amount will be deemed for tax purposes to be a taxable dividend received by you and will, accordingly, be subject to the tax treatment normally applicable to taxable dividends received by shareholders from taxable Canadian corporations.  Distributions of net income and net realized capital gains to tax exempt unitholders will not be subject to tax under the Tax Act.<p>



You will be advised each year of the amount of net income, net taxable capital gains and return of capital paid or payable to you, the amount of net income considered to have been received as taxable dividends and the amount of any foreign taxes considered to have been paid by you.<p>

<a name="taxdisp"></a>

<b>Tax on Dispositions</b><br>

Upon disposition of a unit, including a redemption or a transfer under the Scotia Autopilot service, you will realize a capital gain (or a capital loss) to the extent that the proceeds of disposition exceed (or are exceeded by) the adjusted cost base of your unit at such time plus any costs of disposition.  If you hold units of CanAm Income Fund, you will realize a capital gain (or capital loss) on a disposition of such units by virtue of changes in the value of the United States dollar relative to the Canadian dollar during the period that the units are held by you.  You must include three-quarters of a capital gain in computing income and may deduct three-quarters of a capital loss from the taxable portion of such gains.  Capital gains realized by an individual or certain trusts may give rise to an alternative minimum tax.  For units of a Fund for which an election was filed in your 1994 tax return, your "exempt capital gains balance" may generally be used to shelter capital gains realized on dispositions of units of such Fund made prior to 2005, and four-thirds of amounts distributed prior to 2005 and designated by the Fund as net taxable capital gains of the Fund.<p>

<a name="taxshelt"></a>

<b>Tax Sheltered Plans</b><br>

The Funds are all mutual fund trusts, so units of the Funds are qualified investments for trusts governed by Registered Retirement Savings Plans ("RRSPs"), including Locked In Retirement Accounts ("LIRAs"), Registered Retirement Income Funds ("RRIFs"), including Life Income Funds ("LIFs") and Locked In Retirement Income Funds ("LRIFs"), and Deferred Profit Sharing Plans ("DPSPs") and registered pension plans.  Units of the Funds are eligible for investment by Registered Education Savings Plans ("RESPs").<p>

<a name="taxfor"></a>

<b>Foreign Property Restriction</b><br>

Certain investors such as pension funds or plans and other tax sheltered plans (including RRSPs, LIRAs, RRIFs, LIFs, LRIFs, and DPSPs) are subject to a special tax under Part XI of the Tax Act of 1% per month in respect of excessive holdings of foreign property.  In general terms, the limit under the Tax Act for investment in foreign properties is 20% of the total cost of all assets of the particular pension fund or plan or tax sheltered plan.<p>



The T-Bill Fund, Premium T-Bill Fund, Money Market Fund, CanAm Income Fund, Balanced Fund, Total Return Fund, Dividend Fund, Canadian Blue Chip Fund, Canadian Growth Fund, CanAm Growth Fund and Precious Metals Fund are registered investments and, as such, units of these Funds do not constitute foreign property for the purposes of the Tax Act.<p>



Units of Income Fund and Defensive Income Fund will not constitute foreign property, so long as the cost to these Funds of foreign property held by them does not exceed the foreign property threshold applicable from time to time.  Income Fund and Defensive Income Fund intend to invest their assets so that their units will not be foreign property under the Tax Act.<p>



Units of Global Bond Fund, American Equity Growth Fund, International Fund, Pacific Rim Fund and Latin American Fund will be considered foreign property.  It is the responsibility of each unitholder of Global Bond Fund, American Equity Growth Fund, International Fund, Pacific Rim Fund and Latin American Fund to monitor the amount of foreign property and other assets in his or her sheltered plan or registered pension fund or plan to ensure that the plan or fund restricts its investment in foreign property and is not liable for the foreign property penalty taxes described above.  However, when units of Funds are held in a Scotia Excelsior Funds RRSP or other Scotia Excelsior registered account, the Foreign Content Monitoring Service will automatically ensure that the book value of the account's portfolio does not exceed the 20% foreign property limit.<p>



<a name="taxdeem"></a>

<b>Deemed Income from Rebates</b><br>

The Manager has given each Fund an indemnity against any tax liability for a Fund which arises as a result of the fact that a Fund is deemed to earn as income any rebates which its Manager gives to certain investors or unitholders as described under "Management of the Funds -- Expenses and Fees".  These indemnities provide that the Manager will reimburse the Fund as necessary to ensure that no unitholder will pay or lose any net amount as a result of any such tax liability.<p>

<b><font size=+1>Your Statutory Rights</font></b><br>

<img VSPACE=5 vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>



Securities legislation in certain provinces provides purchasers with the right to withdraw from an agreement to purchase mutual fund shares or units within two business days after receipt of a simplified prospectus or within forty-eight hours after the receipt of a confirmation of a purchase of such securities.  If the agreement is to purchase such securities under a contractual plan, the time period during which withdrawal may be made may be longer.  In several of the provinces and territories, securities legislation further provides a purchaser with remedies for recision or, in some jurisdictions, damages where the simplified prospectus and any amendment contains a misrepresentation or is not delivered to the purchaser within the time limit prescribed by the securities legislation of his province or territory.  You should refer to any applicable provisions of the securities legislation of your province or territory for the particulars of these rights or consult with a legal adviser.<p>

<img VSPACE=5 src="line.gif"><br>

<FONT SIZE = +2><B>YOUR ACCOUNT AGREEMENT<BR>
<img VSPACE=5 src="line.gif"><!--HEADING--></B></FONT>

</CENTER><p>

If we act as a dealer or maintain one or more securities accounts for you, the following terms and conditions will apply.

<p>

<b>General agreement</b><br>

We have the right to buy and sell securities for your account in the way we think best. We may buy or sell separately for your account or as part of a larger transaction for you and others including other customers, our agents and ourselves. We may be on the other side of the transaction either for our own account or that of other customers. These transactions may include broken lots and public and private sales. <p>

<b>Long sales</b><br>

If you place an order with us to sell a security, we consider it to be a long sale unless you tell us at the time that it is a short sale. Except in the case of a short sale, you should not place an order with us to sell securities unless you own them and, if they are not already in our possession, you will deliver them to us as soon as possible. <p>

<b>Short sales</b><br>

If you place a short sell order, you must tell us at that time. If we sell securities for you, and you don't deliver them to us in time for us to deliver them to the buyer within the time required, then we can borrow or purchase a similar kind and amount of securities and deliver them instead. We can also do this if we think it advisable to replace any securities previously delivered by us for your account, or are required to do so by a regulatory body. We do not have to give you advance notice of these transactions and you are responsible for any liability or expenses that result from them.<p>

<b>Maintaining margins</b><br>

You have to maintain the margins we request in your accounts and promptly meet all margin calls. If we think the margin or deposit in any of your accounts is insufficient, we can cancel any open order for the purchase or sale of any securities without giving you advance notice.<p>

<b>Refusing orders or requests</b><br>

We don't have to accept or execute any order or direction or fulfill any request from you if we think it unreasonable or imprudent at our sole discretion. Our assessment of the prudence of any transaction may be based on the state of your account or accounts, the nature of the transaction requested and your financial position.<p>

<b>Service charges, foreign exchange and interest</b><br>

If we make loans to you to cover debit balances in your accounts, we charge you interest in accordance with our custom and with rate increases caused by money market conditions. You are liable for the amount of the loan, the interest, reasonable legal fees and costs of collection. You are also responsible for paying all commissions on securities transactions and for any adjustments for foreign exchange (where applicable) at the rates we establish. The rates of interest and commissions are not stated in this document. Our Schedule of Fees and Commissions is published in the "Outline of our Services" which you will receive subsequent to the opening of your account. Foreign exchange rates are subject to market fluctuations which could increase your ultimate risk.<p>

<b>Ratification of notices and statements</b><br>

Your account statements will be deemed to be correct unless you tell us otherwise in writing within 10 days of us sending you the statement. Each transaction will be deemed to be authorized and any notice about it to be correct unless you tell us otherwise in writing at least 15 minutes before the opening of the market on which the transaction was made on the second business day of us sending you notice of the transaction.<p>

<b>Payments</b><br>

You must pay us what you owe us and provide whatever security we may demand until you do so.<p>

In particular, you must pay promptly on demand for any property that you have asked us to buy for you, whether or not we have received it or delivered it to you. <p>

If you don't pay what you owe us promptly on 

demand, we may: <br>

<ul>

<li>sell securities in any of your accounts to cover the debt

<li>buy any securities of which your account may be short in order to close out a part or all or your account or to close out a part or all of the commitments made for 

your account.

</ul><p>

We don't have to notify you or make any demand on you if we are going to take any of these actions. If we do tell you or make any demand, however, we are not waiving our rights to take them. We are authorized to buy and sell either for ourselves or for other customers, free from any equity or any rights that you may have. <p>

We will apply the proceeds of the sale to what you owe us. You will be responsible for the balance. We will add the costs of any purchase to what you owe us.<p>

If we close part or all of any of your accounts, you must discharge all of your obligations to us and make good any deficiency when we ask you to do so. We won't recognize and you can't enforce any oral agreement to the contrary. <p>

<b>Liens</b><br>

Money, property and rights that we carry for you or are in our possession are pledged to us and shall secure your obligations to us. This applies whether you own the property individually or jointly with others.<p>

We can sell this property by public or private sale on any terms we think fit and use the net proceeds to pay any amount due to us. <p>

We are authorized to pledge or re-pledge the same property or any part of it, either on its own or with property from other customers, for the amount that is due to us or for a greater amount. We can do this without giving you advance notice and whether or not we have in our possession or control at the time other property of the same kind and amount.  <p>

As soon as you have rights in property, our security interest attaches to it. <p>

We don't have to deliver property to you if it is pledged 

to us or subject to a security interest in our favour if you owe us money or, in the case of securities, if they have been loaned by us to another customer in order to cover a short sale.<p>

Our security interest in your property is in addition to any other rights we may hold, either now or in the future.<p>



<b>Power of sale</b><br>

When we think it necessary for the protection of our interests, we can: <br>

<ul>

<li>sell any of your securities, commodities or other property that we are carrying or have in our possession, whether you own it individually or jointly with others 

<li>buy securities, commodities or other property of which your account may be short

<li>enter stop loss orders against any property of which your account may be long or short

<li>withdraw or change any such stop loss orders

<li>make sales or purchases at prevailing prices while stop loss orders are being carried 

<li>cancel any outstanding order or orders to close out your account or accounts in whole or in part in order to fulfill any commitment made on your behalf.

</ul><p>

We can take any of these actions at our discretion in the way we think best without notifying you or making any demand on you. We can also purchase all or any part of your property without you having the right to buy it back and you will remain liable for any deficiency. If we do give you notice of any sale or purchase, or make a demand in connection with it, we are not waiving our right to proceed with the transaction.<p>

<b>Authority</b><br>

If any of you die or are declared legally incompetent by a court with the jurisdiction to do so, this agreement will continue in effect and will be binding on your personal representatives.<p>

<b>Pledging and lending</b><br>

We can hold or carry your property in our general loans without notifying you that we are doing so. Then, from time to time and at any time, we may: <br>

<ul>

<li>pledge, re-pledge or lend your property to ourselves as brokers or to others, with or without other property, for more than the amount due to us and without us having possession or control over property of the same kind and amount 

<li>lend your securities to others who may be holding short positions in those securities.

</ul><p>

We don't have to deliver to you what we purchased for any of your accounts, only property of the same kind 

and amount.<p>

<b>Set-off</b><br>

At our discretion and without notice, we can apply and transfer your property or equity among your accounts, including any joint accounts and accounts guaranteed by you. By equity, we mean the extent to which the amount you owe us is exceeded by the market value at that time of property in your accounts which would be good collateral for brokerage loans. <p>

We can set off the credit balances in your accounts and any of our other liabilities to you against or on account of your indebtedness to us. This applies whether our or your indebtedness is fixed or contingent, due or not or liquidated or not.<p>

When there is a credit balance in any of your accounts, the amount may be commingled with our funds and used for our general business purposes. Such a credit balance will be included in a debtor or creditor account between us and you will rely on our liability for it.<p>

<b>Liability</b><br>

We are not responsible for any loss, damage or expense that you suffer or incur as a result of any transaction undertaken by or for your account on our advice. In addition, we are not responsible if we act or fail to act regarding any transaction or prospective transaction except in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct on our part. <p>

We are not responsible for delays in the transmission of orders due to faulty transmission or communications facilities, or due to other causes we can't reasonably anticipate or control.<p>

We can take any steps necessary to protect ourselves in connection with put or call transactions made for your account including:<br>

<ul>

<li>buy or sell short, or short exempt, shares represented by options made by us for your account

<li>buy for your account any puts or calls that we think necessary to fully protect ourselves.

</ul><p>

We don't have to notify you if we are taking any of 

these steps and you agree to reimburse any expenses that we incur.<p>

<b>Communications</b><br>

We may communicate with you personally or by telephone (taped or otherwise), facsimile transmission or letter. When we send you a letter, we send it to the last address we have for you on file. You must notify us in writing if you change your address. <p>

When we communicate with you, you will be deemed to have received our communication by noon on the next business day after we send it.<p>

This agreement authorizes us to contact you anywhere at any time to discuss actual or potential transactions that have been made or are contemplated or to solicit transactions.<p>

<b>No waiver</b><br>

If we choose not to exercise any of our rights, it doesn't mean we waive them for the future.<p>

<b>Amendments</b><br>

The provisions of this agreement apply to all your accounts with us and can only be changed or waived by a written amendment signed on our behalf by one of our officers. The agreement is irrevocable for as long as you have an account with us or are guaranteeing one.<p>

<b>Applicable law</b><br>

All of the transactions in your account are subject to: <br>

<ul>

<li>the constitution, rules, by-laws, regulations and customs of the exchange or market, and any clearing house, where the transaction took place

<li>all applicable federal and provincial laws and regulations.

</ul><p>

When applicable laws, rules or regulations are changed, the provisions of this agreement that are affected shall be deemed to be changed accordingly. The rest of the agreement, however, is unaffected. <p>

To the extent any provision in this agreement is legally prohibited or invalid, it won't apply. The rest of the agreement, however, will remain valid.<p>



You appoint us as your agent to undertake transactions on your behalf. In doing so, we can advance money, spend it and borrow and deliver money, securities and property. 

All accounts you open or reopen with us are covered by this agreement. It will take effect to our benefit and to the benefit of any organization that succeeds us or to which we transfer our rights under the agreement. The agreement is also binding on you, on your agents, and on your estate, executors, liquidators of succession and administrators.<p>

Whenever possible, each provision of this agreement shall be interpreted in such a manner as to be valid and effective under applicable law. <p>

<b>Age and affiliations</b><br>

When you sign this agreement, you warrant that you are of legal age and unless you have notified us otherwise and provided us with the necessary additional documentation: <br>

<ul>

<li>you are not an employee of a securities or other exchange or any corporation that is mostly owned by an exchange

<li>you are not an employee, officer, director or shareholder of a business that is a member of an exchange or of the Investment Dealers Association of Canada

<li>you are not associated or affiliated with a business in these categories

<li>you are not an employee of any party registered under any securities law or regulations

</ul><p>



If your situation in this regard changes, you must notify us immediately.<p>

If you are an individual, you warrant that no one else has an interest in your account. If you are a joint owner, you and the other owners must assume, jointly and severally, the liabilities and obligations under this agreement .<p>



<b>Liquidity of securities</b><br>

When you open an account, you warrant that unless you tell us otherwise in writing before their delivery: <br>

<ul>

<li>all securities delivered by or for your account are free to be sold legally

<li>if the securities are issued by an organization such as a corporation, they can be freely transferred on its books and thus they may be sold for your account in their principal trading market without having to first obtain permission or an order, make a filing or give notice.

</ul><p>

<b>Credit checks and changing financial status</b><br>

If you experience a material change for the worse in your financial position, you must tell us immediately and give us full details if we ask for them. <p>

You agree to us asking for financial information about you from credit reporting agencies and others in connection with your account. <p>

You also agree to us providing information to credit reporting agencies and to others with whom you have or propose to have a financial relationship.<p>

<FONT SIZE = +2><B>YOUR JOINT ACCOUNT AGREEMENT<BR>

<img VSPACE=5 src="line.gif"><!--HEADING--></B></FONT>

</CENTER><p>

If we open a joint account for you, the following terms apply in addition to those in Your Account Agreement. <p>



<b>What each of you can do on behalf of the account</b><br>

You agree, jointly and severally, that each of you is entitled on behalf of the account, without notice to the other or others of you, to:<br>

<ul>

<li>buy, sell and otherwise deal in securities and commodities through us, whether or not on margin and including short sales 

<li>receive demands, notices, confirmations, reports, statements and any other communications from us

<li>receive and dispose of money, securities and other property from us

<li>make, cancel, waive or change agreements with us

<li>deal with us

</ul><p>

as if you had a sole interest in the account.<p>

<b>What we can do on behalf of the account</b><br>

You authorize us to follow the instructions that any of you give us about the joint account. <p>

These include instructions to make payments or to 

deliver some or all of the securities, commodities and other property in the joint account to any of you or to someone else. <p>

We are authorized to follow these instructions even if the delivery or payment is made to one of you personally. We don't have to ask about the purpose or propriety of a delivery or payment and we are not responsible for what happens to the money, securities, commodities or other property.<p>

You can revoke our authority by writing to us at our head office saying that you want to do so. <p>



<b>Liability</b><br>

All of the owners of your joint account are jointly and severally liable for the account and grant a security interest in it in our favour, as described in Your Account Agreement.<p>

<b>What happens if one of you dies</b><br>

If one of you dies, others who have an interest in the joint account must tell us immediately in writing.<p>

In order to protect ourselves against liability or loss if one of you dies, we may:<br>

<ul>

<li>require papers such as inheritance or estate tax waivers 

<li>retain a portion of transactions in the account, or 

restrict them

<li>take proceedings or any other action we think advisable. 

</ul><p>

The estate of the person who dies and each of the others who has an interest in the account will continue to be responsible to us, both jointly and severally, for any debit balance or loss in the account that: <br>

<ul>

<li>results from a transaction initiated prior to us receiving notice of the death

<li>is incurred in the liquidation of the account

<li>is incurred in adjusting the interests of those remaining who have an interest in the account.

</ul><p>

<FONT SIZE = +2><B>DISCLOSURE STATEMENT FOR RECOGNIZED MARKET OPTIONS<BR>

<img VSPACE=5 src="line.gif"><!--HEADING--></B></FONT>

</CENTER><p>



A high degree of risk may be involved in the purchase and sale of Options, depending to a large measure on how and why Options are used. Options may not be suitable for every investor. See "Risks in Options Trading" and "Additional Information."<p>

<b>Introduction</b><br>

This Disclosure Statement sets forth general information relevant to the purchase and sale of Put and Call Options traded on a recognized market and cleared through a clearing corporation. Information concerning the underlying interests on which Options are traded, the terms and conditions of these Options, the recognized markets on which they trade and the applicable clearing corporations may be obtained from your broker. Information on investment strategies and possible uses of Options may also be obtained from your broker.<p>



This Disclosure Statement refers only to Options and clearing corporations which have been recognized or qualified for purposes of this Disclosure Statement by provincial securities administrators where required. The Options discussed herein trade on markets which, for the purposes of this Disclosure Statement only, are referred to as "recognized markets."<p>

<b>Nature of an Option</b><br>

An Option is a contract entered into on a recognized market between a seller (sometimes known as a writer) and a purchaser where all the terms and conditions of the contract (called the "specifications"), other than the consideration (called the "premium") for the Option, are standardized and predetermined by the recognized market. The premium, paid by the purchaser to the seller, is determined in the market on the basis of supply and demand, reflecting such factors as the duration of the Option, the difference between the exercise price of the Option and the market price of the underlying interest, the price volatility and other characteristics of the underlying interest.<p>

There are two types of Options: Calls and Puts. A Call gives the purchaser a right to buy, and a Put the right to sell, a specific underlying interest at a stated exercise price and within a specified period of time or on a specific date. An Option subjects the seller to an obligation to honour the right granted to the purchaser if exercised by the purchaser. Underlying interests can be shares of a specific corporation, bonds, notes, bills, certificates of deposit, commodities, foreign currency, the cash value of an interest in a stock index or any other interest provided for in the specifications.<p>

An Option transaction is entered into on a recognized market by a purchaser and a seller represented by their respective brokers. When the transaction is concluded it is cleared by a clearing corporation affiliated with the recognized market on which the Option is traded. When an Option transaction is cleared by the clearing corporation it is divided into two contracts with the clearing corporation becoming the seller to the purchaser in the transaction and the purchaser to the seller. Thus on every outstanding Option, the purchaser may exercise the Option against the clearing corporation and the seller may be called upon to perform his obligation through exercise of the Option by the clearing corporation.<p>

Options may also be classified according to delivery requirements: actual delivery and cash delivery. An actual delivery Option requires the physical delivery of the underlying interest if the Option is exercised. A cash delivery Option requires a cash payment of the difference between the aggregate exercise price and the value of the underlying interest at a specified time prior or subsequent to the time the Option is exercised.<p>

Options are issued in series designated by an expiration month, an exercise price, an underlying interest and a unit of trading. At the time trading is introduced in Options with a new expiration month, the recognized market on which the Option is traded establishes exercise prices that reflect the current spot prices of the underlying interest. Generally, three series of Options are introduced with exercise prices at, below and above the current spot price. When the spot price of the underlying interest moves, additional Options may be added with different exercise prices. Options having the same underlying interest and expiration month, but having different exercise prices, may trade at the same time.<p>

<b>Specifications of Options</b><br>

Specifications of Options are fixed by the recognized market on which they are traded. These specifications may include such items as trading units, exercise prices, expiration dates, last day of trading, and the time for determining settlement values.<p>

An Option may be bought or sold only on the recognized market on which the Option is traded. The recognized market and the clearing corporation may each impose restrictions on certain types of transactions, and under certain circumstances may modify the specifications of outstanding Options. In addition, a recognized market or a clearing corporation may limit the number of Options which may be held by an investor, and may limit the exercise of Options under prescribed circumstances.<p>

<b>Exercising Options</b><br>

An Option may have either an American style exercise 

or European style exercise irrespective of where the recognized market is located. An American style Option can be exercised by the purchaser at any time before the expiration. To do this, the purchaser notifies the broker through whom the Option was purchased. A purchaser should ascertain in advance from their broker the latest date on which he/she may give such notice to their broker. A European style Option may only be exercised by the purchaser on a specified date. Upon receiving an exercise notice from the purchaser's broker, the clearing corporation assigns it to a member which may re-assign 

it to a client on a random or other predetermined selection basis. <p>



Upon assignment, the seller must make delivery of (in the case of a Call) or take delivery of and pay for (in the case of a Put) the underlying interest. In the case of a cash delivery Option, the seller must, in lieu of delivery, pay the positive difference between the aggregate exercise price and the settlement value of the underlying interest (in the case of both a Call and a Put).<p>



A purchaser of an Option which expires loses the premium paid for the Option and their transaction costs. The seller of an Option which expires will have as their 

gain the premium received for the Option less their transaction costs.<p>

<b>Trading of Options</b><br>

Each recognized market permits secondary market trading of its Options. This enables purchasers and sellers of Options to close out their positions by offsetting sales and purchases. By selling an Option with the same terms as the one purchased, or buying an Option with the same terms as the one sold, an investor can liquidate their position (called an "offsetting transaction"). Offsetting transactions must be made prior to expiration of an Option or by a specified date prior to expiration. Offsetting transactions must be effected through the broker through whom the Option was initially sold or purchased.<p>



Price movements in the underlying interest of an Option will generally be reflected to some extent in the secondary market value of the Option and the purchaser who wishes to realize a profit will have to sell or exercise their Option during the life of the Option or on the specified date for exercise, as the case may be.<p>

<b>Costs of Options trading</b><br>



<i>Margin Requirements</i><br>

Prior to trading Options, a seller must deposit with their broker cash or securities as collateral (called "margin") for the obligation to buy (in the case of a Put) or sell (in the case of a Call) the underlying interest if the Option should be exercised. Minimum margin rates are set by the recognized market on which the Option trades. Higher rates of margin may be required by the seller's broker.<p>



Margin requirements of various recognized markets may differ. In addition, they are subject to change at any time and such changes may apply retroactively to Option positions previously established.<p>



<i>Commission Charges</i><br>

Commissions are charged by brokers on the purchase or sale of Options as well as on the exercise of Options and the delivery of underlying interests.<p>

<b>Risks in Options trading</b><br>

Options can be employed to serve a number of investment strategies including those concerning investments in or related to underlying interests. SOME STRATEGIES FOR BUYING AND SELLING OPTIONS INVOLVE GREATER RISK THAN OTHERS.<p>



The following is a brief summary of some of the risks connected with trading in Options:<br>

<ol>

<li>Because an Option has a limited life, the purchaser runs the risk of losing their entire investment in a relatively short period of time. If the price of the underlying interest does not rise above (in the case of a Call) or fall below (in the case of a Put) the exercise price of the Option plus premium and transaction costs during the life of the Option, or by the specified date for exercise, as the case may be, the Option may be of little or no value and if allowed to expire will be worthless.

<li>The seller of a Call who does not own the underlying interest is subject to a risk of loss should the price of the underlying interest increase. If the Call is exercised and the seller is required to purchase the underlying interest at a market price above the exercise price in order to make delivery, he/she will suffer a loss.



<li>The seller of a Put who does not have a corresponding short position (that is an obligation to deliver what he/she does not own) in the underlying interest will suffer a loss if the price of the underlying interest decreases below the exercise price, plus transaction costs minus the premium received. Under such circumstances, the seller of the Put will be required to purchase the underlying interest at a price above the market price, with the result that any immediate sale will give rise to a loss.



<li>The seller of a Call who owns the underlying interest is subject to the full risk of their investment position should the market price of the underlying interest decline during the life of the Call, or by the specified date for exercise, as the case may be, but will not share in any gain above the exercise price. 



<li>The seller of a Put who has a corresponding short position in the underlying interest is subject to the full risk of their investment position should the market price of their underlying interest rise during the life of the Put, or by the specified date for exercise, as the case may be, but will not share in any gain resulting from a decrease in price below the exercise price.



<li>Transactions for certain Options may be carried out in a foreign currency. Accordingly, purchasers and sellers of these Options using Canadian dollars will be exposed to risks from fluctuations in the foreign exchange market as well as to risks from fluctuations in the price of the underlying interest.



<li>There can be no assurance that a liquid market will exist for a particular Option to permit an offsetting transaction. For example, there may be insufficient trading interest in the particular Option; or trading halts, suspensions or other restrictions may be imposed on the Option or the underlying interest; or some event may interrupt normal market operations; or a recognized market could for regulatory or other reasons decide or be compelled to discontinue or restrict trading in the Option. In such circumstances the purchaser of the Option would only have the alternative of exercising their Option in order to realize any profit, and the seller would be unable to terminate their obligation until the Option expired or until he/she performed their obligation upon being assigned an exercise notice.



<li>The seller of an American style Option has no control over when he/she might be assigned an exercise notice. He/she should assume that an exercise notice will be assigned to him/her in circumstances where the seller may incur a loss.



<li>In unforseen circumstances there may be a shortage of underlying interests available for delivery upon exercise of actual delivery Options, which could increase the cost of or make impossible the acquisition of the underlying interests and cause the clearing corporation to impose special exercise settlement procedures.

<li>In addition to the risks described above which apply generally to the buying and selling of Options, there are timing risks unique to Options that are settled by the payment of cash.

</ol><p>

The exercise of Options settled in cash results in a cash payment from the seller to the purchaser based on the difference between the exercise price of the Option and the settlement value. The settlement value is based on the value of the underlying interest at a specified time determined by the rules of the recognized market. This specified time could vary with the Option. For example, the specified time could be the time for establishing the closing value of the underlying interest on the day of exercise or in the case of some Options based on a stock index the time for establishing the value of the underlying interest which is based on the opening prices of constituent stocks on the day following the last day of trading. Options for which the settlement value is based on opening prices may not, unless the applicable recognized market announces a rule change to the contrary, trade on that day.

<p>

The settlement value for Options, futures contracts and futures options may not be calculated in the same manner even though each may be based on the same underlying interest.

<p>

Where the settlement value of a cash delivery Option is determined after the exercise period, the purchaser who exercises such Option will suffer from any unfavourable change in the value of the underlying interest from the time of their decision to exercise to the time settlement value is determined. With actual delivery Options, this risk can be covered by a complementary transaction in the actual market for the underlying interest. 

<p>

The seller of a cash delivery Option is not informed that he/she has been assigned an exercise notice until the business day following exercise, at the earliest, and the seller will suffer from any unfavourable change in the value of the underlying interest from the time of determination of the settlement value to the time he/she learns that they have been assigned. Unlike the seller of an actual delivery Option, the seller of a cash delivery Option cannot satisfy their assignment obligations by delivery of the lower valued underlying interest, but must pay cash in an amount determined by the settlement value.

<p>

The type of risk discussed above makes spreads and other complex option strategies involving cash delivery Options substantially more risky than similar strategies involving actual delivery Options.<p>

<b>Tax consequences</b><br>

The income tax consequences of trading in Options are dependent upon the nature of the business activities of the investor and the transaction in question. Investors are urged to consult their own professional advisers to determine the consequences applicable to their particular circumstances.<p>

<b>Additional information</b><br>

Before buying or selling an Option an investor should discuss with their broker:

<ul>

<li>Their investment needs and objectives

<li>The risks they are prepared to take

<li>The specifications of Options they may wish to trade

<li>Commission rates

<li>Margin requirements

<li>Any other matter of possible concern

</ul>

Specifications for each Option are available on request from your broker and from the recognized market on which the Option is traded. Should there be any difference in interpretation between this document and the specifications for a given Option, the specifications shall prevail.

You may indicate your desire to receive notice of meetings of security holders, including audited annual financial statements, and proxies entitling you to vote by initialing Option 1 on Form C - Shareholder Communication Instructions.<p>

<b>If you do not wish to receive such material, please initial Option 2 on Form C.</b><br>

Please indicate whether or not you consent to have 

your name, address and security holdings disclosed to issuers or other senders of material that is required by law to be delivered to security holders by initialing Yes or No on Form C.<p>

Form C - Shareholder Communication Instructions - covers all securities held in your accounts with Scotia Discount Brokerage Inc. Should you have different instructions for a particular security, it should be placed in another account and another Form C in respect of that account completed.<p>



Additional material from the issuer, such as quarterly reports, may be obtained by completing page 4 of the Confidential Account Application with the notice of annual meeting of the issuer, or by writing directly to the issuer requesting that your name and address be added to the issuer's supplemental mailing list. We will assist you to do this upon your request.<p>

You may change your instructions any time by 

writing to us.<p>

<b>If you fail to complete Form C:</b><br>

Discover the convenience and flexibility of a ScotiaLine<font size=-2>&reg;</font> personal line of credit.  It's ideal for expenditures like home renovations or your child's education because you can borrow as you need the funds.<P>



You can draw on it whenever you want to, up to a predetermined limit.  You don't have to borrow the whole amount, as with an installment loan.  And once your line of credit is approved, you don't have to re-apply unless you require a higher limit.<P>



Interest is charged only on the amount that's withdrawn, calculated on daily balances.  Repayment is flexible and prepayments can be made in any amount, anytime, without penalty.<P>



To draw on a line of credit, you write a cheque against your account or use an ABM, just as you would with a regular <a href="pbscheq.htm">chequing account</a>.<P>



Interest rates are generally lower than most credit cards and will vary.  And if the line of credit is secured, you pay a lower rate of interest.<P>

<b><font size=+1>A ScotiaLine personal line of credit<br>

<FONT SIZE = +2><B>CANADIAN UNIVERSITIES: COMPETING TO WIN?<!--HEADING--></B></FONT><BR>

<font size=-1><b>An address by P.C. Godsoe, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,
Scotiabank, presented to The Canadian Club of Toronto, March 4, 1996</b></font><br>

<center><i>"... the development and maintenance of high performance standards in
education and continuously benchmarking ourselves against the best in the world is,
more than ever before, a key to our ongoing success and prosperity..."</i>
</center><p>


Thank you ladies and gentlemen.<p>

What I am going to talk about today is excellence, and the need for excellence in
today's world.  Specifically, I would like to talk about excellence in education.  My
main point today is this:  I believe that we need to create centres of excellence
within our university system to develop our best and our brightest students -- our
business, political and academic leaders of tomorrow -- to ensure that we are able to
compete with the best and the brightest from around the world in the years ahead.<p>

The way I see it is that, if we feel it is fit and proper to ensure that we have the
very best athletes represent us in major sports competitions like the Olympics, and in
professional sports -- like the Blue Jays of a few years ago and the Raptors a few
years hence -- then why does this same logic not hold true for scholastic achievement,
where the need for excellence is even more important?<p>

Let me elaborate.  With today's global competition and the technological revolution --
which, believe it or not, we are only at the start of -- our economic prospects depend
more than ever on the quality of our resources, particularly our human skills.  This is
especially true in countries like Canada -- a trading nation so dependent on
international markets.  We must compete to win against global competition.  And our
traditional comparative advantages -- in trees, minerals and fish, for example -- are
simply not as relevant today.<p>

So I am coming at this issue from a business perspective.  That may be a bit
simplistic, but remember, I am a banker and I am heavily influenced by my experience in
the school of hard knocks and my international experience.  In a service industry like
banking, high quality employees are an essential element of success -- success in
meeting the competitive challenges here at home and in markets around the world.<p>

I should mention that Scotiabank -- with operations in some 44 countries around the
world  -- has given me a very practical view of global competition and today's human
resource requirements.  We know what it takes to compete and win in global markets --
like the U.S. corporate market, where we are a top 10 bank, going head to head with the
big U.S. and major European banks; and in markets like the Far East, where we operate
in 10 different countries and where we are up against the biggest banks in the world. 
High quality and highly trained people make us successful in these markets.<p> 

To give you a more general illustration of the importance of human skills in today's
economy, the number of university graduates with jobs in Canada has increased by more
than 500,000 since 1990 while, during the same period, the number of jobs for people
who have not completed university declined by about 200,000.<p>

The development and maintenance of high performance standards in education -- for our
universities -- and continuously benchmarking ourselves against the best in the world
is, more than ever before, a key to our ongoing success and prosperity.<p>

I want to acknowledge that universities in Canada are developing centres of excellence,
new links with business and new, specialized programs that are taking us in this
direction.  There are a number of success stories -- here in Toronto, elsewhere in
Ontario, and indeed, right across Canada.  There are success stories that show we are,
as a country, already heading in a fundamentally new direction on education.<p>

But more has to be done to support this sort of institutional excellence and to move
the process of change forward at a faster pace.  We see stories in the press every day
on government budget cuts, and the issue is becoming more pressing.  Last month's
student demonstration at Queen's Park -- notwithstanding the trouble -- served to
underscore this point.<p>

This is not to take anything away from the new programs and initiatives that are being
developed and tested in different schools across the country.  Nor is this to take
anything away from our top-ranked universities like Queen's, the University of Toronto,
Western Ontario, Waterloo, Dalhousie, McGill and the University of British Columbia, to
name only a few.  These are all quality institutions.<p>

But I am unaware of any major country outside Canada that does not have two or three
truly world-class institutions -- the "Grandes Ecoles" system in France, the great Ivy
League schools in the U.S., Oxford and Cambridge in the U.K., the University of Tokyo
in Japan, and so on.  These are the types of institutions that we need.<p>

What I am suggesting is that we develop policies and funding schemes to foster
institutions that are first-class by global standards while, at the same time,
supporting the fundamental realignment of our educational system that is already under
way.<p>

What is the downside?  What are the risks of not having, or developing, these sorts of
truly world-class institutions?  <p>

I believe there are two risks.  First, we risk underdeveloping important resources --
not giving our most promising students the very best education.  Second, which I would
call the worst case scenario, is that we risk losing important resources altogether to
other countries -- a "brain drain" of our business, political and academic leaders of
tomorrow which could, ultimately, mean that we would pay a heavy price in the global
marketplace.<p>

Let me step back for a minute and look at where our universities are today -- the good
and the bad in our current system.<p>

On the positive side, public expenditure on education in Canada is among the highest in
the world.  In terms of the percentage of young adults enrolled in higher education, we
rank highest in the world.  We also have a very high proportion of university-educated
adults by international standards.<p>

On the other hand, Canada scores second lowest among G-7 countries in terms of well-
educated people staying employed in their own country, according to the 1995 World
Competitiveness Report.  This is the so-called "brain drain" -- the worst case scenario
that I just mentioned.<p>

In addition, although our university system offers a complete range of programs, it has
not developed the necessary depth in certain key areas that are becoming increasingly
important.  We have, for example, fewer science and engineering graduates than most
developed countries.  These are human skills that we need to develop in order to
improve our research and development capabilities.<p>

Now, much of the good in our current system -- as well as some of the negatives --
stems from the evolution of our university system.  Since the early 1900s, and
especially since the 1960s, government has emphasized a high level of equal access to
post-secondary education.  And as a matter of public policy, one that parallels other
strong social programs that help to set Canada apart, and above, other major countries
in the world, I have no problem with access being a priority for our educational
system.  But it cannot be the only priority.<p>

A second and equal priority must be quality, or institutional excellence.  At a public
policy level, however, I believe that this priority -- to develop schools and programs
to nurture our most promising students, and develop institutional excellence within our
university system -- has not received the attention and support it must.<p>

Access and institutional excellence are not trade-offs; the equation is not as simple
as that.  In fact, the real challenge going forward is to develop the sort of
excellence that I am suggesting while maintaining a satisfactory level of
accessibility.<p>

On that note, I would like to offer a few thoughts on next steps -- a few thoughts on
possible reforms to our educational system.  Naturally, I am talking about the long
term.  While universities, like business, are becoming much more responsive to change,
the issues are huge and there are no quick fixes.<p>

I would like to touch on two issues.  First, I would like to take a look at funding
policies, because money for education is a major issue.  And second, the role of
business, which in part is related to the funding question, but is really much broader
than that.  <p>

So let us look at funding.  Very simply, going forward, there will not be as much money
to run our educational system.  Government support is going to be cut back.  So the
question is, how do we identify and back winning programs and encourage the development
of excellence -- centres of world-class expertise -- in the context of reduced public
funding?<p>

Our university system will see a period of rationalization over the next decade;
overlapping programs must be eliminated or merged, and greater efficiencies in program
delivery and in administration will have to be found and developed.<p>

The answer to the funding question has to lie in better management.  There are a number
of ways to maintain accessibility while reducing costs, to allow a re-allocation of
resources to support the development of institutional excellence.<p>

Distance education -- the so-called virtual classroom, made possible with advances in
technology -- creates enormous opportunities to deliver quality instruction to students
across Canada and around the world through interactive teleconferencing.  The Internet
opens up a whole set of possibilities.  This sort of technology will drive down costs
significantly -- while pushing accessibility to levels not considered possible with
only "traditional" delivery channels.<p>

A greater emphasis on part-time studies and on community colleges, which generally have
lower cost structures, could also drive down total system expenses.  And, of course,
the rationalization of schools, programs and administration is essential.<p>

But, for the most part, how we fund our universities comes down to a very fundamental
choice.  Should we continue to expect government to decide how money should be
allocated for universities -- what I will call the bureaucratic status quo option -- or
should we let competition among our universities decide, on the basis of peer
competition for funding?  <p>

This second option is clearly the one I favor.  Under the status quo, spending on
education in Canada would remain high and we would continue to see a high number of
graduates -- both good things.  But we would, in effect, be perpetuating the
over-emphasis on access by rewarding and funding schools on the basis of number of
students.<p>

I would argue that this sort of funding equation makes our universities a tool of
social policy.  I very strongly support the need for universality in certain areas of
social policy such as health care and pensions -- these needs are clearly understood. 
But I do not believe that universities should be funded on the basis of headcount.<p>

Existing funding schemes have hurt the overall quality of education in Canada.  I find
it somewhat ironic that over the past couple of decades, as the demands on higher
education were becoming more diverse, universities were becoming more alike and trying
to be all things to all people.<p>

Existing funding mechanisms have also eliminated much of the accountability in the
system -- student fees cover only about 15 per cent of total university costs.  That is
not much of a check and balance.  Instead, why not allocate research money to
universities on the basis of competition?  Why not provide some government funding,
while letting universities vary fees?<p>

This would force universities to compete for students -- for bursary and scholarship
money.  It would also make it easier for students to pick the university they want to
attend -- for specific programs and specific areas of excellence.  And it would make it
easier for employers to know where they should go to recruit the best students in a
particular field.<p>


As a matter of fact, many universities are already jockeying for the most promising
students.  Rob Prichard at the University of Toronto brought bus loads of Metro's most
motivated students in for an open house last year.  And Carleton University in Ottawa
-- which was built on the basis of accessibility but today suffers from declining
enrolment -- is introducing a new elite program in the humanities later this year.<P>

In other words, many of our foremost academic leaders, such as Mr. Prichard at Toronto,
Larry Tapp, who is newly ensconced at the University of Western Ontario -- now the Ivey
-- Business School, and others, are welcoming change, challenge and competition -- and
that is great.<p>

On the issue of tuition, fees at U of T or Queen's or Western are about one-tenth of
the tuition at a U.S. Ivy League school.  Even public universities in the U.S. have
significantly higher fees.  Encouraging our universities to develop world-class
programs in Canada would mean that a premium could be charged, which would support an
even greater emphasis on institutional excellence.  The winners get funded, while the
losers must change.<p>

Typically, the argument you hear against higher tuition is that this would mean certain
students could not afford a university education.  I am certainly not arguing for some
form of elitism.  But, the experience of other countries would suggest that low tuition
is not necessarily required to protect access.  Australia eliminated tuition several
years ago but saw practically no change in the demographic make-up of its student
population.  They have since gone back to charging tuition fees.<p>

That said, I am very conscious that last year's enrolment numbers in Canadian
universities levelled off, and that this year's preliminary statistics show the number
of applications to Ontario universities for this fall are down.<p>

So access -- based on merit, not the ability to pay -- must be protected.  It is time,
in my view, for governments to re-examine their student loan programs.  It is time to
look at loan systems that link repayment schedules to income after graduation.  Over
the past couple of years, banks have developed very aggressive student loan programs. 
At Scotiabank, we are funding more students' loans than ever before.  <p>

As well, we need to encourage private institutions to supplement public institutions
with more focused privately funded schools.  On this front, I believe that we need to
re-think our fundamental approach to education.<p>

Let me make one last point on funding.  Individual generosity towards universities in
Canada has never equalled that experienced in the U.S., but if the education-economic
prosperity link is better understood, my sense is that this support will improve. 
Certainly, university fundraising in the corporate sector has become much more
sophisticated and much more relevant over the past few years.<p>

Which leads me to the last item that I would like to discuss:  the role of business in
education and the development of institutional excellence, and in private funding of
programs.<p>

Canada has a good track record on this count.  We have been leaders in the university
co-op concept -- with the University of Waterloo probably the best example.  Clearly,
universities and business must continue to work together on these sorts of programs.<p>

But even more is required of business today.  It is no longer sufficient to simply
provide donations.  Business has a responsibility to ensure that it supports
institutions financially and in program development, making sure that programs are
aimed at real needs, real skills and real benefits to the student and to our
community.<p>

To use Scotiabank as an example, our financial support for educational institutions
over the past year totals almost $2 million, including our commitments to new programs. 
And more and more, we are helping fund specific programs -- working with universities
to make sure that we are adding value, that our efforts are oriented towards the job
market and that we are helping to develop necessary skills.<p>

To give you a couple of examples, we recently funded a program at Carleton University
to expand its link to the information highway by sponsoring a major expansion of the
schools' electronic communications infrastructure.<p>

At the University of Saskatchewan, we have donated $250,000 to develop and deliver an
Aboriginal business program, in response to the growing demand for Aboriginal business
leaders who understand increasingly complex economic, government, land claim and
resource issues.  And the program is enjoying great support.<p>

At Simon Fraser University, we are funding -- for $300,000 -- a new program for women
entrepreneurs, who are a fast growing group and key element in the small business
market.<p>

And at the University of New Brunswick, a $200,000 donation last month will help
establish the Scotiabank distance education centre.  UNB has emerged as a strong
regional leader in technology-assisted education.  Over 100 courses are offered,
through CD-ROMs, audio and video teleconferencing, and on-line PC hook-ups.<p>

These are new approaches and new attitudes, they reinforce the strong
business-education partnership track record that already exists, and constitute funding
of relevant programs rather than just bricks and mortar.<p>

On that note, let me summarize.  I believe that our economic future depends on our
ability to create, use and manage knowledge as effectively -- more effectively -- than
the rest of the world.  I believe that human skills -- that people -- are the only true
source of comparative advantage over time.  And I believe that we have to move towards
the forefront of university education by developing the sort of institutional
excellence that exists in other countries.  Or we risk, over time, losing our best and
most capable people -- our leaders of tomorrow.<p>

To do this, we need to unbundle our funding and allow universities to compete for
research grants; we need to tolerate variation in tuition fees to promote institutional
excellence; and we need to permit private institutions to play a role in our university
system.  Let the market, not the government, determine which universities succeed and
where our centres of excellence are.<p>

Ladies and gentlemen, we have a great country and I, personally, believe in its future 
-- a future that demands the best and most challenging of educational systems.<p>

Thank you very much.<p>

<h2>Canadians lack basic knowledge about RRSPs, survey finds</h2>


<B>TORONTO</B> -- Almost six out of every ten Canadians now have money invested in Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSPs), according to a public opinion poll prepared for Scotiabank by Goldfarb Consultants.* Canadians also indicated that, on average, they want to retire at age 58 with an average annual retirement income of $48,000 in today's dollars.  Despite these goals, however, about 60% of RRSP investors reported that their RRSP holdings currently total less than $50,000.<p>

"Canadian adults are turning to RRSPs in increasing numbers in order to secure their financial future," said Mr. Stephen Tile, Chief Operating Officer, Goldfarb Consultants.  "In fact, those closest to retirement age -- 45 years and older -- reported that they are expecting personal savings and investments to supply almost 40% of their retirement income, with the Canada Pension Plan and private or company pensions contributing the rest."<p>

"What our findings also show, however, is that many Canadians lack basic knowledge about RRSPs and are not taking full advantage of the benefits that RRSP investing has to offer," he said.<p>

The poll found that there is a low level of awareness about what the annual RRSP limits are for individuals, with almost half of RRSP investors (46%) unable to state the dollar amount of their annual maximum allowable contribution.  While eight in ten RRSP investors were aware that they can carry forward unused RRSP contribution room from year to year, more than half  (52%) could not specify how much unused contribution room they currently have, and most could not accurately identify where to get this information. <p>

"This reveals that people are not planning their RRSP investing, or at least are not planning to maximize their investment," said Mr. Tile.  "In fact, the number of Canadians who plan to maximize their RRSP contribution has declined dramatically from 53% in 1992 to only 37% in 1996."  (Source: 1996 Goldfarb Report.)<p>


<Font Size=-1>* 	Telephone survey of 1,003 Canadian household financial decision-makers.  A survey of this size is accurate to within +/- 2%, 19 times out of 20.</Font><p>

"These survey findings are consistent with Statistics Canada income tax data," observed Mr. Warren Jestin, Senior Vice-President and Chief Economist.  "Despite a steady year-over-year increase in RRSP contributions since the early 1980s, Canadians invest only about 13% of what they are eligible to save on a tax-deductible basis each year.  Recent data show that over 80% of Canadian tax filers -- or 16.6 million people -- have a cumulative total of more than $179 billion in unused RRSP contribution room."<p>

"The savings shortfall goes well beyond RRSP contributions," Mr. Jestin said.  "The household savings rate is now at a 26-year low in Canada, and has recently fallen below the American rate for the first time since the early 1970s.  Of course, this largely reflects the tougher economic realities facing many families across Canada."<p>

"However, these financial pressures make it all the more important for Canadians to pay close attention to their RRSP investment strategy," he added.  "Enhancing the return on your financial resources today increases the odds of enjoying a comfortable retirement." <p>

"For a thirty-five year old with an accumulated amount of $10,000 in unused contributions, the consequences of not using the top-up provision, assuming a conservative annual growth rate of 4.75%, would be a loss of approximately $40,000 in accumulated savings upon retirement at age 65," explained Mr. Ron Laursen, Senior Vice-President, Retail Deposits and Services.<p>

"The tendency toward short-term thinking in RRSP planning has been revealed over time in our research data," said Mr. Tile.  "In the 1996 Goldfarb Report, for example, almost half of RRSP investors (49%) said they base the decision of how much to contribute to their RRSP on the amount of money they have 'available', as opposed to the amount of tax they want to defer, (17%), or the amount of money they want to have available for retirement, (8%).<p>

"The data shows there is a definite discrepancy between RRSP investing behaviour and the expectations that Canadians have of where their retirement income will come from, and in what amounts," he said.<p>

Survey results further indicated that few RRSP investors (22%) have ever borrowed funds to make an RRSP contribution.  Moreover, those who never have borrowed funds say they are unlikely to ever do so, (82% not very/not at all likely).<p>

"Borrowing to invest in an RRSP can make good financial sense, particularly when the tax refund is used to pay down the loan," said Mr. Laursen.  "The recently launched 'Scotiabank RRSP Catch-Up Loan' was designed specifically for this purpose -- to help Canadians catch up and keep up with their RRSP contributions."<p>


"For example, if that same thirty-five year old borrowed the $10,000 to top up his or her RRSP, the financing costs under our program would be $1,208, provided that the person used the tax refund to pay down the loan," Mr. Laursen continued.  "But the extra investment would be worth an additional $40,000 at retirement."<p>

"The survey shows that Canadians are counting on their RRSPs for a substantial portion of their total retirement income," said Mr. Laursen.  "It also shows that Canadians who are not on track with their RRSPs would benefit from more information to help them plan over a longer time frame.  This in turn may motivate them to contribute earlier, save more and diversify their investments to achieve their goals."<p>

"After all, when it comes to retirement planning, the worst thing you can do is nothing," Mr. Laursen concluded.  "We hope to help our customers begin the process, so they can maximize their returns and ensure a successful financial future."<p>

<h2>Scotiabank exceeds financial targets in 1996</h2>


<B>Toronto</B> -- Scotiabank today reported record <B>net income</B> of $1,069 million for the year ended October 31, 1996, up $193 million or 22% from a year earlier.  <p>

"Our results this year reflect strong performances by all of Scotiabank's main business lines," said Mr. Peter Godsoe, Scotiabank's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.<p>

"Innovative new products and focused sales efforts contributed to market share gains in virtually all domestic product areas, including mortgages, credit cards, retail deposits and small business lending," Mr. Godsoe explained.   "Corporate banking improved significantly, largely because of better conditions in the real estate portfolios in Canada and the United States.  Investment banking, now fully integrated with Scotia Capital Markets, enjoyed a very strong year, earning over three times the level of net income achieved in 1995.  Internationally, we continued to expand our valuable network with new branches and offices in the Caribbean, Greece, Costa Rica, Thailand and Vietnam, as well as a new stake in Grupo Financiero Inverlat in Mexico." 	<p>

Other <B>year-over-year highlights</B> include:<p>
<ul>
<li><B>earnings per share</B> were $4.08, up from $3.38 last year;<br>
<li><B>return on equity</B> increased to 15.8% from 14.2%; and<br>
<li><B>return on assets</B> improved to 0.71% from 0.64%.<p>
</ul>
 
<B>Total assets</B> at October 31, 1996 were $157.3 billion, an increase of $10.1 billion or 6.8% from 1995.<p>

"Scotiabank's financial results exceeded our targets once again in 1996," Mr. Godsoe said.  "We surpassed our target return on equity with an ROE of 15.8%.  We met our goal of maintaining a productivity ratio of less than 60%, achieving an industry-leading performance of  58.8%.  We increased annual dividend payments by six cents per share, and the book value per share increased by $2.32."  <p>

"In 1996, common shareholders enjoyed a strong return of 52.3% from owning Scotiabank shares, through dividends and share price appreciation," Mr. Godsoe added.  "In addition, Scotiabank has paid a dividend every year since its inception in 1832.  The increase in 1996 marked the 23rd time in the last 25 years that the dividend on our common shares has increased."<p>

"Scotiabank's record success in 1996 benefits many Canadians," Mr. Godsoe continued.  "Shareholders, including people who participate in pension plans or mutual funds that hold Scotiabank shares, benefit through the increasing value of their holdings.  Customers are able to enjoy added convenience and an ever-increasing array of new services, resulting from our ongoing investments in product development and new technologies.  Scotiabank employees benefit from the Bank's strength and stability, as do the thousands of businesses which supply goods and services to us.  And governments at all levels benefit from the $1.11 billion in direct and indirect taxes we incurred in 1996."  <p>

<B>Net income for the fourth quarter</B> was $283 million, up from $230 million in the final quarter of last year.  <B>Return on equity</B> was 16.0%, compared to 14.1%, while return on assets was 0.72%, up from 0.65%.  <B>Earnings per share</B> during the quarter were $1.08, up from $0.88 for the same period last year.<p>

For the year, net interest and fee income reached a record level of $5.47 billion on a taxable equivalent basis, representing growth of 15% from 1995.   The revenue gains were broadly based, with all main business lines serving more customers and expanding their fields of activity.  <p>

<B>Net interest income</B> in 1996 totalled $3.58 billion, an increase of 15% over last year.  Excluding the $145 million write down in 1995 of the Bank's original investment in Grupo Financiero Inverlat, the increase would have been 10%.  Strong growth in earning assets across all business lines contributed to this increase, as did securities gains of $129 million in 1996, versus gains of $38 million in 1995, (excluding the Inverlat write down).  In addition, the cost of funding impaired loans was reduced in 1996, due to a decline in interest rates and in the overall level of impaired loans.<p>

<B>Other income</B> totalled $1.78 billion in 1996, an increase of 14% from last year.  Excluding the gain of $105 million from the sale of reinsurance plans by Scotia Insurance (Barbados) in 1995, the year-over-year growth would total 23%.  The popularity of the Bank's electronic and card services contributed to the strong gains in other income.  As well, loan fees rose 15%, reflecting the Bank's strength in structuring and syndicating wholesale credits, as well as the increased use of bankers' acceptances as an attractive form of financing.  Record customer volumes in both the Bank's full service and discount brokerage operations resulted in revenue growth of 50% in these areas in 1996.<p>

<B>Non-interest expenses</B>, at $3.22 billion, grew by 13% in 1996, due largely to performance-related compensation and higher business volumes.   Almost half of the 16% increase in personnel expenses in 1996 came from higher incentive compensation and commissions at Scotia Capital Markets, which achieved substantial increases in revenues. <p>

"In a high-volume, low-margin business like banking, a focus on productivity is critical," Mr. Godsoe said.  "Scotiabank is proud of our history as the holder of one of the best productivity records in Canadian banking.  With continued improvements to operations and new strategic alliances with leading business partners, we expect to remain at the forefront of productivity leadership." <p>

The Bank's <B>productivity ratio</B> -- non-interest expenses as a percentage of total revenues -- improved to 58.8% in 1996 from 59.9% in 1995.  This marks the sixth year that Scotiabank was able to keep this ratio below 60%, despite expanded operations, increased employment levels and ongoing investments in technology.  <p>

<B>Net impaired loans</B> declined by $704 million or 49% to $743 million in 1996.  Net impaired loans as a percentage of total loans and acceptances improved to 0.7% in 1996, a reduction from 1.4% a year ago and 0.8% in the prior quarter.  As a ratio of the total portfolio, net impaired loans are now at their lowest level since 1989.<p>

<B>Specific provisions for credit losses</B> declined substantially to $380 million in 1996, a decrease of $180 million from 1995.   The Bank's general provision remained at $325 million at the end of 1996, which is one of the strongest among Canadian banks.   <p>

At year end 1996, there was a surplus of $1,056 million in the market over book value of the Bank's <B>securities portfolio</B>, (which includes developing country securities).  This surplus was higher than the $644 million surplus at July 31, 1996, due to the strong markets in Canadian equities, bonds and LDC securities.   

<B>Capital funds</B> reached $11.0 billion at October 31, 1996, an increase of $431 million or 4.1% from 1995.  Tier 1 capital was $7.84 billion and rose by $793 million, primarily from net earnings and the dividend reinvestment program.  Tier 2 capital was $2.53 billion and declined by $609 million in 1996, as a result of the redemption of the $350 million Series 1 preferred shares and a reduction in the qualifying portion of subordinated debentures.  To increase Tier 2 capital, $350 million in subordinated debentures were issued on November 21, 1996.

At year end 1996, Scotiabank's <B>Tier 1 capital ratio</B> was 6.69% and the <B>total capital ratio</B> was 8.85%.  Furthermore, if the new subordinated debentures issued on November 21, 1996 were to be included, the total capital ratio would rise by 30 basis points to 9.15%, and the Tier 2 ratio to 2.46%.

An increase in the <B>quarterly dividend</B> of three cents per common share was approved by the Board of Directors at today's meeting, raising the quarterly dividend to 37 cents, payable on January 29, 1997 to shareholders of record as at the close of business on January 7, 1997.<p>

<h2>Canadian economy poised for lift-off, Scotiabank economists say</h2>

<B>TORONTO</B> -- After years of bumping along the runway, the Canadian economy is poised to lift off, Scotiabank's economists said in their latest <a href="market.htm">Global Economic Outlook</a>, released today. <p>

"Strong export markets and the powerful domestic stimulus from sharply lower interest rates will fuel solid economic gains in 1997," explained Warren Jestin, Senior Vice-President and Chief Economist, Scotiabank.  <p>
 
"It's payback time," Mr. Jestin stated.  "Years of fiscal and monetary restraint have dramatically improved our economic fundamentals.  With growth exceeding three per cent, Canada will not only lead the G7 in 1997,  it will also have one of the lowest inflation rates in the industrial world."  <p>

Scotiabank's economists note that Canada is on track for a record $37 billion trade surplus this year, ten times the level just five years ago.  Moreover, exports are poised to reach new highs in 1997.  <p>

"Canada is the most trade-intensive economy of the G7," Mr. Jestin observed.  "Over half of Canadian manufactured output is destined for export -- largely to the buoyant U.S. market.  The resource sector also can look forward to solid growth as Japan and Europe revive."<p>

The report notes that Canadian businesses have reduced inventories and are gearing up to meet improved market conditions.  Private sector employment is trending higher, with manufacturing accounting for most of this year's job gains.  The private sector has created roughly 150,000 jobs in the first nine months of 1996, offsetting cuts in the public sector by a factor of more than three to one.  <p>

"Consumers remain cautious, but should be in more of a buying mood in the months ahead," Mr. Jestin predicted.  "Stronger job creation will boost disposable income gains to more than match inflation.  Sharply lower interest rates also are providing a sizeable cash infusion to borrowers, who tend to be bigger spenders, helping to pull consumers off the sidelines."  <p>

The report observes that investors have become very positive about Canada's inflation, trade and fiscal fundamentals.  This has enabled the Bank of Canada to cut interest rates nine times since the beginning of the year, eight times independently of the U.S. Federal Reserve.   As a result, domestic interest rates have fallen well below American levels for terms up to ten years -- a rare phenomenon over the past two decades.  The dollar has moved to 74 cents (US) despite the sharp drop in rates, a barometer of  rising investor confidence.<p>

Looking ahead, Scotiabank's economists predict that U.S. borrowing costs will likely  start moving modestly higher over the winter in response to an uptick in activity and inflation.  While Canadian rates will eventually follow suit, they should remain substantially below American levels through 1997.  Our dollar will probably rise into the 75-77 cent (US) range a year from now. <p>

Mr. Jestin emphasized that the better financial market tone is solidly based in Canada's economic and fiscal fundamentals. <p>

 "Domestic inflation has been below U.S. levels for an unprecedented six years and will remain there for the foreseeable future," he said.  "Record trade surpluses, a sharp increase in tourism and reduced foreign debt service costs have eliminated the need for Canada to borrow abroad to finance domestic activity.  Based on current trends, the federal government will finally begin paying down its huge market debts before the turn of the decade.  All of these factors are powerfully positive for our financial markets and our economic prospects."<p>

Regionally, Alberta will continue to lead provincial growth in 1996 and 1997.  However, Ontario has moved into second place, fuelled by a solid turnaround in manufacturing.  New Brunswick and Nova Scotia will lead in the Atlantic region, supported by a diversification into higher technology sectors and upcoming tax cuts.  Exports remain a bright spot for Quebec, though the pace of growth will continue to lag the national average.  The three Prairie provinces are being boosted by increased economic diversification, strong international demand for grains and balanced provincial budgets.  The B.C. economy remains buoyant, though the pace of activity has slowed substantially because of softer exports and a cooling off of the housing market.<p>

On the international scene, Scotiabank economists see a recovery in the European markets, fuelled by low interest rates and increased consumer spending. The emerging economies, led by China, will stay at the top of the global growth charts, fuelled by increased domestic spending and massive infrastructure projects.<p>

"Overall, 1997 is shaping up to be Canada's best year this decade in terms of a sustainable, broadly based economic performance." concluded Mr. Jestin.<p>

<h2>Alberta will top provincial growth charts, Scotiabank economists say</h2>


<B>TORONTO</B> -- Alberta will lead provincial income and consumer spending increases this year and next, according to a report released today by Scotiabank economists.<p>

"Strong performances are anticipated from most of Alberta's key industries and investment is widespread," commented Janet Slasor, Senior Economist.  "This solid economic performance is translating into significant employment growth.  More than two-thirds of the population over 15 years of age are employed, well above the 58 per cent national average." <p>

"Alberta residents, already enjoying no provincial retail sales taxes and lower income taxes, will receive further tax relief for low and middle income working families beginning next year," added Ms. Slasor.  "This will further enhance households' spending power."<p>
   
"Alberta also stands out as the only region where housing starts will be higher next year than the average over the past decade," predicted Senior Economist Mary Webb.  "Alberta's higher proportion of individuals in the 25-34 age bracket, who have relatively large spending requirements, will provide an added boost to big ticket sales." <p>

These trends are described in Scotiabank's  <a href="pulse.htm#alta">Provincial Pulse</a> report, the latest issue of which focuses on regional consumer spending patterns.  All regions outside British Columbia are expected to witness stronger consumer spending increases this year and next compared to the first half of the decade.  Alberta will lead the growth charts in both income and spending, but Ontario is the major turnaround story next year.<p>

Improved farm cash inflows and economic diversification are supporting an upturn in consumption in Manitoba and Saskatchewan. In Quebec and Atlantic Canada, growth in household spending will roughly double, although it will still remain below the national pace.   B.C. consumer spending growth has shifted into lower gear, in line with the other provinces, after outstripping national trends from the latter half of the 1980s to 1994.<p>

<h2>Economic pick-up in Atlantic provinces supports back-to-back annual increases in consumer spending, Scotiabank economists say</h2>


<B>TORONTO</B> -- Economic growth in the Atlantic region will strengthen through 1997, bolstered by ongoing diversification in New Brunswick and gains in Nova Scotia, according to a report released today by Scotiabank economists. <p>

"Atlantic consumers are expected to post two consecutive spending increases of roughly 1 1/2 per cent in 1996 and 1997 -- the strongest performance since 1990," said Janet Slasor, Senior Economist, Scotiabank.  "Nova Scotia's cut in personal income taxes next July plus the slated harmonization with the federal GST in each province except P.E.I. next April will help to maintain spending momentum."  <p>

"The completion of the Confederation Bridge linking P.E.I. and New Brunswick and the winding down of Hibernia construction in Newfoundland will constrain growth below the national average," observed Ms. Slasor.  "However, the longer term prospects are brightened by the promise of several major projects, such as Voisey's Bay and Sable Island." <p>

"The competitive dollar and the region's focus on tourism will continue to boost spending on the East Coast," added Senior Economist Mary Webb.<p>

These trends are described in Scotiabank's  <a href="pulse.htm#atlantic">Provincial Pulse</a> report, the latest issue of which focuses on regional consumer spending patterns.  All regions outside British Columbia are expected to witness stronger consumer spending increases this year and next compared to the first half of the decade.  Alberta will lead the growth charts in both income and spending, but Ontario is the major turnaround story next year.<p>

Improved farm cash inflows and economic diversification are supporting an upturn in consumption in Manitoba and Saskatchewan. In Quebec and Atlantic Canada, growth in household spending will roughly double, although it will still remain below the national pace.   B.C. consumer spending growth has shifted into lower gear, in line with the other provinces, after outstripping national trends from the latter half of the 1980s to 1994.<p>

<h2>B.C. economy shifting into lower gear, Scotiabank economists say</h2>


<B>TORONTO</B> -- British Columbia's economic and consumer spending growth have moderated. However, the province's performance will still match the national average this year and next, according to a report released today by Scotiabank economists.<p>

"While a gradual firming is expected in key resource markets over the next year, growth will continue to be driven by population inflows and the service sector," said Mary Webb, Senior Economist, Scotiabank.  <p>

"Consumer spending plans are being constrained by moderating income gains, the prospect of increasing fiscal restraint, high housing costs and heavy debt burdens," Ms. Webb continued.   "However, recent interest rate declines have brought some relief to B.C. households, who support the highest debt relative to after-tax income in Canada." <p>

"B.C.'s broad-based tourism industry will also provide important support for retailers and hospitality and recreation services," added Ms. Webb.<p>

"The attractiveness of B.C. as a retirement destination is also a big influence on spending patterns," noted Janet Slasor, Senior Economist.  "Real personal expenditures on medical services have risen at an average annual rate of 2 1/2 per cent so far this decade -- more than double the national average." <p>

These trends are described in Scotiabank's  <a href="pulse.htm#bc">Provincial Pulse</a> report, the latest issue of which focuses on regional consumer spending patterns.  All regions outside British Columbia are expected to witness stronger consumer spending increases this year and next compared to the first half of the decade.  Alberta will lead the growth charts in both income and spending, but Ontario is the major turnaround story next year.<p>

Improved farm cash inflows and economic diversification are supporting an upturn in consumption in Manitoba and Saskatchewan. In Quebec and Atlantic Canada, growth in household spending will roughly double, although it will still remain below the national pace.   B.C. consumer spending growth has shifted into lower gear, in line with the other provinces, after outstripping national trends from the latter half of the 1980s to 1994.<p>

<h2>Income gains boost retail spending in Manitoba and Saskatchewan, Scotiabank economists say</h2>


<B>TORONTO</B> -- Manitoba and Saskatchewan are reaping the benefits of strong international grain markets, increasing economic diversification and balanced provincial budgets, according to a report released today by Scotiabank's economists.<p>

"Consumer spending growth in the two provinces will be second only to Alberta this year, and a further, albeit smaller, gain is likely in 1997," said Janet Slasor, Senior Economist. <p>

"Healthy farm receipts, alongside payments to landowners stemming from the elimination of the Crow Rate subsidy, are encouraging spending," Ms. Slasor explained.  "While employment gains have been modest this year, unemployment rates remain relatively low and job creation is expected to pick up in 1997." <p>

"Over the past two years, Manitoba and Saskatchewan have witnessed the most widespread increases in consumer spending across Canada," commented Senior Economist Mary Webb.  "The upbeat mood partially reflects the fact that these provinces are over the hump in solving their fiscal problems." <p>

These trends are described in Scotiabank's  <a href="pulse.htm#man">Provincial Pulse</a> report, the latest issue of which focuses on regional consumer spending patterns.  All regions outside British Columbia are expected to witness stronger consumer spending increases this year and next compared to the first half of the decade.  Alberta will lead the growth charts in both income and spending, but Ontario is the major turnaround story next year.<p>

Improved farm cash inflows and economic diversification are supporting an upturn in consumption in Manitoba and Saskatchewan. In Quebec and Atlantic Canada, growth in household spending will roughly double, although it will still remain below the national pace.   B.C. consumer spending growth has shifted into lower gear, in line with the other provinces, after outstripping national trends from the latter half of the 1980s to 1994.<p>

<h2>Ontario consumers will come off the sidelines next year, Scotiabank economists say</h2>

<B>TORONTO</B> -- Ontario's economic growth is forecast to accelerate to over 3.5 per cent next year, with exports piggybacking on a strong U.S. economy, according to a report released today by Scotiabank's economists.  <p> 

"Consumer spending is expected to reinforce the upswing, encouraged by a pick-up in full-time employment, personal income tax cuts and low interest rates," commented Mary Webb, Senior Economist.  <p>

"Personal income tax reductions will help Ontario residents deal with the substantial drag from fiscal restraint," Ms. Webb continued.  "Boosted by the tax cuts last July and this January, real disposable income per capita is expected to post a solid increase in 1997, following a nine per cent decline from 1989 to 1995."<p>

"Housing demand in Ontario is already responding," observed Senior Economist Janet Slasor.  "The province is expected to account for over one-half of the anticipated national recovery in housing starts in 1996 and 1997."  <p>

These trends are described in Scotiabank's  <a href="pulse.htm#ont">Provincial Pulse</a> report, the latest issue of which focuses on regional consumer spending patterns.  All regions outside British Columbia are expected to witness stronger consumer spending increases this year and next compared to the first half of the decade.  Alberta will lead the growth charts in both income and spending, but Ontario is the major turnaround story next year.<p>

Improved farm cash inflows and economic diversification are supporting an upturn in consumption in Manitoba and Saskatchewan. In Quebec and Atlantic Canada, growth in household spending will roughly double, although it will still remain below the national pace.   B.C. consumer spending growth has shifted into lower gear, in line with the other provinces, after outstripping national trends from the latter half of the 1980s to 1994.<p>

<h2>Quebec economy to pick up in 1997, but consumers will remain cautious, Scotiabank economists say</h2>


<B>TORONTO</B> -- The pace of economic activity in Quebec is expected to pick up next year according to a report released today by Scotiabank economists.  However, growth will continue to lag the national average, with consumer spending held back by modest payroll gains and fiscal restraint.<p>

"There are some pockets of consumer spending strength,"  observed Mary Webb, Senior Economist.  "Recreation services,  apparel and footwear purchases have registered heathy gains in the past three years. However, full-time employment growth remains illusive," continued Ms. Webb.  "This will slow the recovery in motor vehicle sales."<p>

Senior Economist Janet Slasor noted that recent interest rate declines and a sharp drop in house prices have significantly improved the affordability of home ownership, which bodes well for the housing market.  In Montreal, the carrying costs for an average-priced home now absorb just over 15 per cent of pre-tax family income, less than half the burden in Vancouver. <p>

These trends are described in Scotiabank's  <a href="pulse.htm#que">Provincial Pulse</a> report, the latest issue of which focuses on regional consumer spending patterns.  All regions outside British Columbia are expected to witness stronger consumer spending increases this year and next compared to the first half of the decade.  Alberta will lead the growth charts in both income and spending, but Ontario is the major turnaround story next year.<p>

Improved farm cash inflows and economic diversification are supporting an upturn in consumption in Manitoba and Saskatchewan. In Quebec and Atlantic Canada, growth in household spending will roughly double, although it will still remain below the national pace.   B.C. consumer spending growth has shifted into lower gear, in line with the other provinces, after outstripping national trends from the latter half of the 1980s to 1994.<p>

<h2>Scotiabank launches two new mutual funds</h2>

<B>TORONTO</B> -- Scotiabank today announced the launch of two new mutual funds, <I>Scotia Excelsior European Growth Fund </I>and <I>Scotia CanAm&#174; Money Market Fund</I>.  Both funds satisfy the increased demand by Canadians for diversification beyond purely Canadian or Canadian dollar denominated investments.  With the two new funds, the Scotia Excelsior Fund family consists of 21 funds, including nine funds offering access to foreign investments and/or currency diversification.<p>

"Canada represents less than three per cent of world stock market capitalization.  As a result, Canadian investors continue to place greater emphasis on foreign investments.  This trend recognizes the substantial growth potential that exists in other parts of the world, and the critical importance of diversification in investment planning," said Andrew Scipio del Campo, President and CEO of Scotia Securities Inc.<p>

<I>Scotia Excelsior European Growth Fund</I> is designed to capitalize on projected growth and opportunity in Europe due to the evolution of the European economic community and the privatization trend in Eastern Europe.<p>

The Fund will invest primarily in high-quality, listed equity securities, including closed-end country funds from a broad range of European countries.  The Fund may be held in an RRSP/RRIF up to the 20 per cent foreign content limit.<p>

The <B>Scotia CanAm&#174; Money Market Fund</B> provides interest income in U.S. dollars and U.S. currency exposure, while still being 100 per cent RRSP/RRIF-eligible because the debt securities and money market instruments are issued by Canadian federal, provincial or municipal governments.<p>

"This Fund should appeal to investors who are optimistic about the prospects of the U.S. dollar, and those looking for a secure U.S. dollar income stream rather than aggressive growth," said Mr. Scipio del Campo.<p>

Scotia Excelsior Fund assets have increased to $4.6 billion from $3.4 billion since January 1st of this year, an increase of 37 per cent.  This compares to 24 per cent for the mutual fund industry as a whole.  Scotia Excelsior Funds are available from Scotia Securities on a no-load basis, exclusively through Scotiabank branches, Scotia Discount Brokerage and ScotiaMcLeod. <p>

<h2>Scotiabank Commodity Price Index strengthens in August</h2>


<B>TORONTO,</B>  -- The Scotiabank Commodity Price Index, which measures price trends in Canada's major exports,  rose by 1.5% in August, bringing it to a level 0.9% higher than this time last year.<p>

The Forest Product Index surged ahead in August.  Lumber prices were boosted by robust U.S. housing starts and concern over limits on fee-free exports from B.C., Alberta, Ontario and Quebec.  Meanwhile, higher oil prices pushed up the Oil and Gas Index.  The Metal and Mineral Index also edged up in August, with stronger precious and slightly firmer base metal prices.  In contrast, the Agricultural Index lost ground as wheat, barley, canola and cattle prices offset stronger hogs.<p>

"The moderate pace of commodity price gains we have seen recently is a reflection of  mixed industrial activity among the G7," said Patricia Mohr, Scotiabank's Vice-President, Economics.   "Strength in the United States and some turnaround in Germany have been offset  by soft conditions in France and Italy, and a largely flat performance in the United Kingdom.<p>

"Meanwhile, Japanese competitiveness has received a boost from significant yen depreciation against the U.S. dollar over the past year," she continued.  "Foreign orders from Japan have increased more than 55% in July, and we have witnessed some recovery in business investment."<p>

Other highlights include:<p>
<ul>
<li>Bumper crops are expected on the Prairies;<p>

<li>Canadian oil exports will climb by an annualized $1 billion in 1997, as the Express Pipeline comes on stream;<p>

<li>Pulp producers announce another US$40-50 per tonne price increase for October.<p>
</ul>

<h2>Scotiabank purchases stake in <I>i</I>STAR and signs agreement to develop Intranet-based branch banking solution</h2>


<B>TORONTO,</B>  --  Scotiabank announced today that it has agreed to purchase a stake in <I>i</I>STAR <I>internet inc.</I>, effective September 27, 1996.  The transaction is valued at about C$10 million, and will give Scotiabank approximately 10% ownership of <I>i</I>STAR, as well as a seat on its Board of Directors.<p>

"We view this as a unique opportunity to invest in a Canadian company that is at the forefront of the fast-growing knowledge-based industry -- a sector which Scotiabank supports very strongly," said Robert Brooks, the Bank's Executive Vice-President for Investment Banking.  "<I>i</I>STAR has quickly become a Canadian leader in this industry, and we believe our investment in the firm offers the Bank excellent potential for long-term growth." <p>

"Becoming directly involved in the ownership of a leading knowledge-based company is a key strategic move for Scotiabank, as we explore alternative delivery channels for our products and services," said Albert Wahbe, Scotiabank's Executive Vice-President, Operations.  "<I>i</I>STAR has expertise in the design, marketing, and maintenance of on-line  technologies, and we are excited about the array of possibilities that this alliance provides us.<p>

"Never before has technological innovation been such an important competitive advantage as it is in today's financial services market," he explained.  "We believe that this alliance will help Scotiabank to maintain its position as a leader in the introduction of convenient, leading-edge and customer-focused banking technologies."<p>

The Bank also announced that it has signed a letter of intent with <I>i</I>STAR which will see the firm design and maintain Scotiabank's Intranet site serving employees in branches and offices across Canada.  <p>

"An Intranet site will provide Scotiabank employees across Canada -- and ultimately throughout our 47-country network -- with access to the same, constantly updated flow of information about our products and services," said Mr. Wahbe.  "This improved access to information will not only help our employees but, just as importantly, will assist them in serving our customers more effectively."  <p>

"Scotiabank's investment signals a strong recognition of the role that technological solutions will play in delivering the next generation of financial products and services to consumers and businesses," said Craig Wallace, Executive Vice-President, Corporate Development, <I>i</I>STAR <I>internet inc.</I>.  "We are very pleased that the Bank has identified <I>i</I>STAR both as a worthy investment and as a business partner."<p>

<I>i</I>STAR has already developed a number of Internet and Intranet solutions within the Scotiabank Group, including the development and hosting of Scotia Capital Markets' Web site, and a telephone banking service training application.  The letter of intent signed between the two organizations will expand their relationship to include the development of business tools for the Bank's domestic branches and Executive Offices.  Solutions currently under development include on-line marketing tools, electronic loan application facilities, and employee work access from home.<p>


Since it was introduced in May, the Scotia Capital Markets Web site has been praised by industry observers for its innovative features -- such as research reports, daily market commentary and "top three interesting buys" -- as well as its attractive design and ease-of-use.   <p>

<I>i</I>STAR is Canada's leading Internet solutions company, with over 250 employees.  Headquartered in Ottawa, the company has regional offices in Halifax, Montreal, Toronto, Edmonton, Winnipeg, Calgary and Vancouver.  <I>i</I>STAR offers high-speed connection to the Internet through a national backbone network, and provides customers with a broad range of networking expertise and Web-based products and services.  <I>i</I>STAR shares trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSE.WWW).  More information on <I>i</I>STAR can be found on the World Wide Web at http://www.istar.ca.<p>

With C$158 billion in assets, Scotiabank is one of North America's largest financial services companies.  It is also Canada's most international financial institution, with branches and offices in 47 countries around the world.  <p>

<h2>Scotiabank announces amendments to Shareholder Dividend and Share Purchase Plan</h2>

<B>TORONTO,</B>  -- Scotiabank today announced amendments to its Shareholder Dividend and Share Purchase Plan.

The five per cent price discount on shares issued through the plan will be eliminated. This change brings the Bank's Shareholder Dividend and Share Purchase Plan more in line with those of the majority of its competitors.  Shares distributed to plan participants will be issued either from treasury or purchased in the open market. <p>  

In addition, the minimum Optional Cash Payment has been increased to $100.00 per month from $50.00, a reflection of the increased trading price of the Bank's shares.<p>

These amendments, subject to regulatory review, are to take effect November 1, 1996.<p>

<h2>AUCC and Scotiabank launch Awards for Excellence in Internationalization</h2>




<B>Ottawa</B> -- A new Awards for Excellence in Internationalization program, sponsored by the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada and Scotiabank, will recognize Canadian universities' efforts to transform themselves into institutions with an international perspective.  Scotiabank has pledged $180,000 to fund the Awards over the next three years.	<p>

"Recognition for universities' international outlook in teaching, research and community service is long overdue," says Robert Giroux, president of AUCC.  "This process we call 'internationalization' is vital to the quality of higher education and to Canada's future."<p>

"Canadian educators have the very important responsibility of preparing our country's future leaders for the challenges and opportunities created by our increasingly global community," says Scotiabank Chairman and CEO, Peter C. Godsoe.  "Scotiabank lives these challenges and opportunities each day, and so we are especially pleased to support the AUCC's efforts to encourage internationalization at our universities."<p>

Best practices will be highlighted as award recipients are selected by an independent panel for this year's categories: student participation; university-private sector partnerships; curriculum change; international partnerships; and resources for internationalization.  The practices will be collected and published next year.  <B>The three-year awards program will offer five awards per year, and winners will be recognized at a ceremony in Ottawa in March 1997.</B><p>

"We expect universities will seize this opportunity to demonstrate the variety of actions they have been taking over the years to bring a global outlook to their campuses," says Robert Giroux.<p>

AUCC represents Canadian universities at home and abroad.  Its mandate is to foster and promote the interests of higher education.<p>

Scotiabank's first branch outside North America was opened in Kingston, Jamaica in 1889.  Today, its international presence consists of more than 1,400 offices and branches in 47 countries around the world.<p>

<h2>Scotiabank's pledge to support construction of  Chinese Cultural Centre of Greater Toronto</h2>


<B>TORONTO,</B>  -- Scotiabank announced today that it has made an $80,000 donation to the Chinese Cultural Centre of Greater Toronto.<p>

"The Chinese Cultural Centre of Greater Toronto will bring Chinese art and history to Toronto -- not just for the enjoyment of Chinese who now call the area home, but also for Canadians who are interested in learning more about our rich and vibrant culture," said Dr. Ming-Tat Cheung, who is spearheading the fund raising drive and initially proposed the idea of the Centre. "We hope that Scotiabank's generous donation will encourage other corporations to help us bring this dream one step closer to reality."<p>

"We have a very close relationship with the Chinese community across Canada and here in Toronto, so we are extremely pleased to show our support for this important project," said John Young, Senior Vice-President of Scotiabank's Toronto Region.  "We believe that the Cultural Centre will not only entertain, but also educate people from all backgrounds about Chinese culture and history."<p>

Once enough funds are raised, the $15 million Centre will be built at Markham Road and Sheppard Avenue in Scarborough.  The initial phase will consist of  a 23,000-square foot main building, including a meeting hall, art gallery and Chinese history resource centre, while the second phase will feature a 600-seat theatre and a courtyard for receptions.  The site will also house a library and a community centre to be built by the city of Scarborough. <p>

<h2>Scotiabank continues strong performance in third quarter</h2>



<B>TORONTO</B> -- Scotiabank today reported net income of $275 million in the third quarter ended July 31, 1996, an increase of $50 million or 22% from the same period a year ago.<p>



"All business lines contributed to our strong third quarter performance," said Mr. Peter Godsoe, Chairman and CEO, Scotiabank. "The diversity of Scotiabank's operations -- in Canada and around the globe -- is one of our core strengths.  During the first nine months of fiscal 1996, 60% of our earnings have come from our International, Corporate and Investment Banking divisions.  The balance of our net income has been earned through our retail and commercial branch network in Canada."<p>



<B>Earnings per share</B> rose sharply to $1.04, up from $0.86 in the same period last year.  <B>Return on equity</B> increased to 16.0% from 14.2%, and <B>return on assets</B> improved to 0.70% from 0.64%. <p>



<B>Net income for the first nine months</B> of fiscal 1996 was $786 million, a year-over-year increase of $140 million or 21.6%.  <B>Earnings per share</B> of $3.00 were up from $2.50 in the same period a year ago; <B>return on equity</B> of 15.7% increased from 14.2%; and <B>return on assets</B> was 0.70%, up from 0.63%.<p>



<B>Net interest income</B> was $895 million in the third quarter, an increase of $83 million or 10.4% over the same period last year.  The increase was due mainly to asset growth and larger gains from the sale of investment securities. <p>



<B>Non-interest income</B> for the quarter was $451 million, an increase of $63 million or 16.2% over the same quarter last year.  The growth was broadly based, with particular improvement in underwriting fees and stock brokerage commissions, as well as revenues generated from increased credit card use.<p>



<B>Non-interest expenses</B> for the third quarter were $799 million, up from $709 million in the same period a year ago.  The majority of this increase was in human resource expenses, reflecting the implementation of a new incentive plan for all Canadian employees, as well as higher performance-linked compensation for Scotia Capital Markets.  The Bank also increased employment levels to serve growing market share. <p>



"In today's fast-paced marketplace, it is our employees who give us the competitive edge," stated Mr. Godsoe. "An increase in expenses related to human resources reflects the Bank's commitment to its employees and to maintaining that edge." <p>



Despite the increase in expenses, Scotiabank maintained its <B>productivity ratio</B> -- non-interest expenses as a percentage of total revenues -- at 58.2%, unchanged from the same period a year ago.  On a year-to-date basis, the Bank's productivity ratio improved to 58.9% from 59.8% in the same period a year ago.<p>



"One of Scotiabank's core strengths is our commitment to superior productivity," Mr. Godsoe said.  "The use of new technologies, and initiatives such as our recent operations alliance with CIBC, position Scotiabank to enhance our productivity even further."<p>



Credit quality continued to improve in the quarter.  <B>Net impaired loans</B> outstanding declined to $805 million, or 0.8% of loans and acceptances, an improvement from the prior quarter amount of $937 million or 0.9%.  Net impaired loans as a percentage of loans and acceptances are now at the lowest level since 1989.  <p>



The full year <B>provision for credit losses</B> is estimated at $380 million, which is 32.1% lower than the previous year's provision of $560 million.  The loan loss charged in the third  quarter was $95 million, a reduction of $33 million year-over-year and unchanged from the immediately preceding quarter.  The Bank's <B>general provision</B> remains at $325 million, one of the highest of the Canadian banks.<p>



At July 31, 1996, there was a substantial surplus of $644 million in the market over book value of the Bank's <B>securities portfolio</B> (which includes developing country securities). This surplus was slightly lower than the $669 million surplus at April 30, 1996, as the Bank realized some securities gains during the third quarter.  In addition, the Bank had a surplus of market over book value in its <B>developing country loan portfolio</B> of $270 million, up from $192 million at the end of the previous quarter.<p>



<B>Total assets</B> rose to $158 billion from $152 billion at April 30, 1996.  Loan growth of $1.9 billion was comprised of increased volumes in most categories, including domestic residential mortgages, international loans in the Pacific and the Caribbean, and corporate lending in the U.S. and Europe.  Also contributing to the increase in assets were securities, which rose $2.2 billion, comprised of growth in both the trading and investment portfolios.<p>



<B>Capital funds</B> rose to $11.3 billion as at July 31, 1996, an increase of $220 million from the prior quarter.  The increase arose primarily from strong earnings retention of $166 million.<p>



The improvement in capital was offset by strong asset growth, resulting in lower capital ratios.  At quarter end, the <B>Tier 1 capital ratio</B> was 6.71%, a decline from 6.78% at the previous quarter end.  The total capital ratio decreased to 9.37% from 9.63%.<p>



The Board of Directors approved a <B>quarterly dividend</B> of 34 cents per common share, payable on October 29, 1996, to shareholders of record as of October 1, 1996.<p>

<h2>Scotiabank, IBM announce Canada's first fully transactional Internet banking service</h2>



<B>TORONTO</B> -- Scotiabank and IBM today announced plans to launch Canada's first fully transactional banking service on the Internet this autumn.  Scotiabank's PC banking service differs from others offered in that it will utilize the public Internet rather than a private data network, and it will offer a wider range of services than those currently offered by other Canadian financial institutions.<p>

  

Initially, customers will be able to check balances, transfer funds between accounts, pay bills and review account transactions.  Over time, they'll be able to activate from a personal computer nearly all the same complex, consultative banking services currently offered by bank staff, such as credit card and credit limit applications; loan, mortgage and insurance product purchases; loan and mortgage payments; mutual fund and GIC purchases; investment, budgeting and retirement planning; and brokerage services.  Customers will also be able to download information from Scotiabank's PC banking service to personal financial software packages.<p>



The service will be launched this fall with a test group of eligible Bank customers and staff.   The launch to customers nationwide is scheduled for January, 1997. <p>



"Banking on the public Internet could be the biggest milestone in banking since the invention of the automatic banking machine," said Bob Lounsbury, Vice-President of Card Products and Marketing at Scotiabank.  "Home computers and Internet surfing will soon become as common as televisions and channel surfing.  That's when PC banking will really take off."<p>



The Bank chose computer services market leader IBM Canada to be its high-tech partner in building a public Internet PC Banking platform, and together they have designed the service to be entirely secure.  The IBM solution masks customer account numbers, and does not provide identification of customer names.  Users will be required to have a PC, a modem, access to an Internet service provider, and to be registered with the Bank in order to use this service.<p>



"Industry standards and security were top priorities in developing Scotiabank's Internet PC banking solution," said Shahla Aly, General Manager, Internet Consulting and Services for IBM Canada Ltd.  Industry standards ensure useability of such things as browser technology, and also allow for the future functional growth of Scotiabank's PC banking service.<p>



"Security is paramount to Scotiabank.  We have taken IBM's experience and recommendations in proven security techniques, including encryption and firewalls, and have applied the Bank's policies and procedures.  We are confident in the privacy and integrity of our customers' transactions," said Paul Wing, Scotiabank's Vice-President of Systems Security & Control.<p>



"The Internet is rapidly evolving from an information network to a strategic delivery channel for many industries, especially financial services," said Ron Ziola, Vice-President and General Manager, Banking, Finance and Securities for IBM Canada Ltd.  <p>



"IBM is committed to the Internet, and we are investing heavily in R & D for Internet-based technologies and applications.  As a result, IBM has developed significant expertise in this area.  We are leveraging our North American development efforts in the areas of interactive financial services, infrastructure projects and electronic commerce initiatives to help Scotiabank develop and deploy Internet-based banking services.  We are delighted to be working with Scotiabank on this industry-leading initiative," said Ziola.<p>



"We think customers of today and tomorrow will want to do business with the bank that offers customers the most choice in terms of how, when and where they can bank," said Bob Lounsbury.  "We were the first Canadian bank to accept non-government student loan and student VISA applications on-line.  Now, by offering full transactional banking on the public Internet, Scotiabank can provide the same convenience to all customers." <p>



Scotiabank has been aggressively improving its self-service banking capabilities for the past several years, and was the first to introduce wireless debit/credit card terminals. As well, the Bank's ABM network has been significantly upgraded with the latest and most advanced multiple-function machines.  For example, Scotiabank was the first bank to incorporate mini-statement processing capabilities into regular ABMs.  Widespread integrated passbook updaters are now being made available across the country. A fully-automated ABM bill payment service will be introduced in October.  Telescotia -- the Bank's telephone banking service -- is being rolled out across Canada with completion scheduled for September. <p>



As the most international of Canadian banks, Scotiabank provides a complete range of retail, commercial, corporate, investment, and international banking services to customers around the globe.  Through 1,400 branches and offices in 46 countries, Scotiabank's 33,700 employees deliver the quality service that has made Scotiabank one of North America's premier financial institutions. <p>



IBM Canada Ltd. is a leading provider of advanced information technologies, including computer systems, software, networking systems, storage devices and microelectronics.  Through its extensive suite of professional services, IBM helps customers apply these advanced technologies to create value for their organizations and their customers.<p>



With headquarters in Markham, Ontario, IBM Canada and its subsidiaries employ over 12,300 people across the country.  More information on IBM Canada's products and services can be found on its web site at www.can.ibm.com.<p>

<h2>Scotiabank and Omega Digital Data Unveil Canada's First Portable Wireless Debit/Credit Card Terminal For Restaurants and Gas Stations</h2>



<B>TORONTO</B> -- Scotiabank and Omega Digital Data today unveiled Canada's first hand-held wireless point of sale terminal at Toronto's Bellair Cafe.  Called Scotia 2020 Premiere&#174;, the terminal is designed for restaurants or gas stations, where the traditional direct payment terminal was inconvenient or infeasible.  <p>



"Previously, customers paying with a debit card had to stand beside an establishment's cash register to punch in their personal identification number.  This system didn't make sense for restaurants and gas stations, so we had to find an alternative.  Now, these establishments can bring credit and debit card terminals right to their customer's table or car," said Ed Lomax, Assistant General Manager of Merchant Products at Scotiabank.<p>



"As a service business we always look for new ways to provide better customer service.  We think our customers will appreciate Premiere service," says Charles Khabouth, owner of the Bellair Cafe.  The Bellair Cafe was chosen to pilot Premiere in advance of its national rollout.<p>



"Not only does this service make it more convenient for customers to pay by credit or debit card, it also provides an added measure of security.  For example, customers won't have to worry about forgetting their card at a restaurant, or getting the wrong card back from staff," said Mike Coveley, CEO of Omega Digital Data, the company which developed the terminal.<p>



Scotia 2020 Premiere&#174; makes customers' lives easier in other ways, too.  It can calculate tips -- in dollars or percentages -- so customers don't have to do math calculations on a napkin.  Patrons can also access their bank account and get cash back from their restaurant or gas station, thus saving another trip to the bank.<p>



More than 150,000 merchants have begun offering Direct Payment since the nationwide rollout of Interac last year.  These merchants process over 47 million transactions per month across Canada.  That number is expected to increase substantially as new point of sale products make debit card technology accessible to a greater number of retail establishments.<p>

<h2>Labuan, Malaysia branch license a first for Canadian banks, says Scotiabank</h2>


<B>TORONTO,</B> --  Scotiabank announced today that it has received approval from the Malaysian government to open a branch in the offshore financial centre of Labuan.  It is the first Canadian bank to receive such a license.<p>

"Since being declared an offshore financial centre by the Malaysian government just seven years ago, Labuan has become a major commercial hub in Asia Pacific," said Kevin Rowe, Scotiabank's Executive Vice-President for the Pacific Region.  "We see great potential for business development through this new branch, and believe it will be an excellent complement to both our Malaysian subsidiary and our 11-country Asian network."<p>

Labuan Island is located about 10 kilometres off the coast of Malaysia's Sabah province.  In 1989, the government established the island as a centre for offshore banking and insurance, trust fund management and offshore investing in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and Asia Pacific markets.  Scheduled to open in November, 1996, Scotiabank's branch will provide a broad range of services, including foreign currency loans, trade finance and private banking to both residents and non-residents of Malaysia.  It will also do business with medium and large corporations operating in the area.  <p>

Opening a branch in the offshore centre will enable Scotiabank to tap the large market for foreign currency loans to Malaysian companies.  About US$16 billion of these loans has been booked through Labuan branches of international banks -- mainly for large infrastructure projects. <p>
 
Scotiabank first opened a branch in Kuala Lumpur in 1973, and was the last foreign bank to receive a license to operate in Malaysia.  In 1994 it incorporated the branch locally to form The Bank of Nova Scotia Berhad, allowing it to offer a greater range of products and services to retail, commercial and corporate customers.  The Bank is one of North America's largest financial institutions, with C$152 billion in assets.  Its 34,000 employees serve customers in 47 countries on five continents around the world, making it Canada's most international financial institution.<p>

<h2>Scotiabank Commodity Price Index drops in June</h2>





<B>TORONTO</B> -- Scotiabank's Commodity Price Index, which measures price trends in Canada's major exports, declined by 3.8 per cent in June, after two months of substantial gain.<p>



The Forest Product Index eased in June, as lumber prices temporarily lost ground and newsprint prices softened.  Plunging copper prices pushed down other key base metal prices, resulting in a sharp drop in the Metal and Mineral Index.<p>



Oil prices remained firm, underpinned by low world stocks, strong U.S. gasoline demand and a delay in Iraq's humanitarian oil sale.  Meanwhile, spot natural gas prices in the southern U.S. climbed close to their peak levels in winter. <p>



In the agricultural sector, slightly lower wheat prices offset a pick-up in cattle and hogs.  Though the global wheat crop is expected to rise by 8% in 1996-97, supply conditions will remain tight.  The stock-to-use ratio is likely to be the second lowest in more than three decades at the end of the coming crop year.<p>



Other highlights include:<p>

<ul>

<li>Pulp price increase successfully implemented in the United States.<p>



<li>High North American inventories pressure newsprint.<p>



<li>The expected pick-up in aluminium prices could be limited by softening fundamentals for copper.<p>

</ul>

<h2>Scotiabank donates $25,000 to Red Cross Quebec Flood Relief effort</h2>



<B>MONTREAL</B> -- Scotiabank announced today that it will donate $25,000 to the Red Cross' nationwide campaign to raise $2 million for flood relief efforts in Saguenay and Eastern Quebec. The campaign, called "The Gift of Solidarity", has a fund raising goal of $2 million.<p>



"Scotiabank's gift will contribute to the Red Cross' massive efforts to help those affected by the flood and to bring life in the area back to normal as soon as possible," said Guy Bisaillon, Scotiabank's Senior Vice-President for Quebec and a cabinet member of the Red Cross' Annual Campaign.  "The nation-wide demonstration of humanity and concern for one's neighbours over the past week has been very moving."<p>



Earlier this week, Scotiabank announced that it would be one of several financial institutions accepting donations for the Red Cross campaign at its Canadian branches.<p>

<h2>CIBC AND SCOTIABANK FORM ALLIANCE TO PROVIDE LEADING-EDGE FINANCIAL SUPPORT SERVICES</h2>





<B>TORONTO</B> -- CIBC and Scotiabank today announced that they are creating a strategic alliance aimed at enhancing a wide range of their processing and technology operations.  The two banks will be equal partners in the alliance. <p>



	The alliance, which is subject to regulatory approval, is the first step in an innovative strategy to support top quality customer service with leading-edge technology.  Unique in scope, it will explore opportunities to improve the performance of operations in the following areas:  <p>

<ul>

<li>network support;

<li>computing centres;

<li>end-user devices such as personal computers and point-of-sale terminals;

<li>ABM servicing;

<li>processing of items such as cheques, bills, credit card drafts and statements.

</ul><P>

	The new alliance will seek partnerships with other companies which have specialized technology and related management expertise that can benefit CIBC and Scotiabank.  CIBC announced separately that it has signed a letter of intent to create such a partnership in the items processing area with Fiserv Inc.  It is expected that Scotiabank will participate through its strategic alliance with CIBC. <p>



The alliance also offers growth opportunities.  It will focus on expanding areas of processing operations, such as new electronic banking infrastructure, rather than on cutting costs in declining areas, such as cheque processing.  The alliance intends to offer support services to other financial institutions, to government departments looking to control costs and to other businesses which need more advanced and efficient processing services than they have today.<p>





"Our alliance provides us with an opportunity to participate in the potential growth of new business," said Burt Napier, CIBC executive vice-president, operations & technology.  "We will be able to offer management expertise and the most advanced technology to other institutions."<p>



"This strategic alliance is unique in scope and magnitude," said Albert Wahbe, Scotiabank executive vice-president, operations.  "It creates tremendous opportunities to take advantage of the most advanced technology and lead the evolution in banking operations." <p>

	

The two banks expect their alliance to achieve substantial benefits in technology investment, productivity and infrastructure costs.  For example, CIBC and Scotiabank expect their alliance to result in savings in the following areas:<p>

<ul>

<li>Computer and software maintenance:  Sharing resources will result in savings as well as elimination of duplicate software;<p>



<li>Premises:  Co-location of similar processing functions will result in real estate savings;<p>



<li>Telecommunications:  Co-operation in redesign of telecommunications networks will result in significant savings.<p>

</ul>

Other areas where the alliance can achieve significant benefits will emerge as discussions evolve.<p>



	The two banks' estimated combined annual operating expenditures in the areas covered by the new alliance are approximately $650 million.  CIBC and Scotiabank estimate that co-operation through the new alliance will result in a savings of approximately 15% of this amount.<p>



	Most of these savings will be the result of economies of scale and reduced infrastructure costs.  While detailed business plans are currently being developed, the two banks expect the alliance to have minimal impact on jobs in the near term. <p>



	"Our banks are re-thinking our operations in response to the challenges of changing consumer demand, new technology and new forms of competition," Mr. Napier said.  "We are taking this bold new initiative to revamp our operations so we can continue to provide leading-edge services to customers."<p>

	

	"This new arrangement ensures that our banks will stay at the forefront of changes in technology," Mr. Wahbe said.<p>



	Scotiabank, with $152 billion in assets, is Canada's most internationally diverse bank, serving customers through 1,460 branches and offices in 47 countries around the world. <p>



	CIBC is Canada's second largest financial institution with over $183 billion in assets.  Its 40,000 employees offer a full range of products and services to individual, business, corporate and government clients through 1,400 branches and offices across Canada and around the world.<p>

<h2>Scotiabank finalizes agreement to increase stake in Grupo Financiero Inverlat</h2>







<B>MEXICO CITY</B> -- Scotiabank announced today that it has finalized the agreement to increase its investment in Grupo Financiero Inverlat, S.A. de C.V.  Under the terms of the agreement, Scotiabank will purchase 10% of the equity in the Group, and receive an option to purchase an additional 45% by July 31, 2000.<p>



"This agreement reflects our view that Mexico -- and all of Latin America -- will make a major contribution to the global economy in the next century," said Scotiabank's Chairman, Peter C. Godsoe, at the signing ceremony here with Mexican Finance Minister, Guillermo Ortiz, and National Banking and Securities Commission President, Eduardo Fernandez.  "We look forward to working with Inverlat's management and the Mexican government to ensure that the Group plays a significant role in this country's development. <p>



"For business people operating in the NAFTA environment, our alliance will provide seamless access to a financial group with a strong franchise in Canada and top-ten status as a lender to Corporate America," he continued.  "Inverlat's Mexican customers, meanwhile, will have convenient access to Scotiabank's worldwide network spanning five continents."<p>



Scotiabank will immediately invest US$31.25 million in Inverlat, in exchange for 10% of the equity in the Group. It will also purchase debentures totalling US$143.75 million.  These debentures carry an option allowing Scotiabank to convert them to 45% of the voting common stock on July 31, 2000.  Until that date, the Mexican government will own at least 51% of the Group, either directly or indirectly, and will ensure that Banco Inverlat -- the Group's commercial banking subsidiary -- is able to satisfy all its regulatory capital requirements.<p>



"This partnership ensures Inverlat's ability to operate and grow, and will enable the Group to pursue profitable new business opportunities," said its Chairman, Xavier Autrey.  "We are excited to have the opportunity to work with such a strong and well-respected bank -- one that has a truly global vision."<p>



At the signing, Mr. Godsoe saluted Agustin Legorreta, Inverlat's former Chairman who announced his retirement last month.  Mr. Legorreta will continue to serve as a consultant to Scotiabank and its affiliates throughout Latin America. <p>



"For many years, the name Agustin Legorreta has been synonymous with banking in this country," he said.  "His expertise as a businessman and as a banker -- combined with his own personal strength -- has benefitted Mexico for decades, and we look forward to drawing on his advice in the years ahead."<p>



Grupo Financiero Inverlat consists of five operating subsidiaries:  Banco Inverlat is the fourth-largest commercial bank in Mexico, with a network of more than 300 branches throughout the country; Casa de Bolsa Inverlat is one of the country's leading investment banks; and, three smaller subsidiaries -- Arrendadora Inverlat, Factoring Inverlat and Casa de Cambio Inverlat -- are involved in leasing, factoring and foreign exchange, respectively.<p>



Scotiabank is one of North America's largest banks, with C$152 billion in assets.  Its 34,000 employees serve customers in 47 countries on five continents, the most extensive international network of any Canadian financial institution.<p>

<h2>Scotiabank & Universities Work To Solve Dental Tuition Dilemma</h2>





<b>TORONTO</b> -- Scotiabank, The University of Western Ontario and The University of Toronto today announced a plan to help dental students cope with a 100 per cent rise in entry-level tuition fees this year.  Called Scotia Professional &#174; Student Plan, this banking and financing package was designed especially for dental students at The University of Western Ontario and The University of Toronto. 

<p> 

"Only a few weeks ago the Government of Ontario introduced a new policy for funding dental education.  We therefore had to find a way to provide additional financial aid to meet the higher tuition fees.  Scotiabank had already demonstrated their commitment to providing value-added, low-cost banking and loan service to students, including Canada Student Loans and their own Scotia Student Loan program," said Daniel Lang, The University of Toronto's Vice-Provost & Assistant Vice-President of Planning and Budget.

<p>

"We looked to Scotiabank for a way to ease our students' financial burden. The Bank listened, and devised a viable solution," said Peter Mercer, Ph.D, Vice-President Administration and General Counsel at The University Of Western Ontario.

<p>

To access the pre-arranged loan funds, which over the course of students' studies may amount to $40,000, students need only write a cheque on their account.  "It's that easy," said Steve Klein, Vice-President of Canadian Commercial Banking at Scotiabank.  "This innovative program provides the professional degree student with a simple, flexible financial package of products and services specifically designed to meet their needs throughout their university years."  <p>

<h2>Scotiabank and ADP Canada announce co-venture to provide the Bank's customers combined payroll and human resources services</h2>



<b>TORONTO</b>  -- Scotiabank and ADP Canada today announced that they are launching a new venture to provide the Bank's business customers with a new range of co-branded payroll and human resources services. <p> 



"This initiative will provide business customers -- small or large -- with access to the broadest range of payroll and human resources services available from a major Canadian bank," said Mr. Albert Wahbe, Scotiabank's Executive Vice-President, Operations.  "ADP products will complement Scotiabank's existing services, providing much added value for our customers."  <p>



Scotiabank's current product line, including the new <I>Scotiapay Plus</I> Windows (TM) system, will be expanded with the addition of ADP products such as phone-based payroll systems and client/server human resources systems.<p>



"ADP's phone-based service, where payroll information is conveyed by phone to a central processing facility, is perfect for the small business customer who does not have the time or computer capacity to perform payroll functions," stated Mr. Wahbe.  "The client/server human resource systems will be of particular interest to larger customers, as they enable companies to track information ranging from individual employee benefits to employment equity statistics." <p>



Under the terms of the arrangement, ADP Canada will assume the administration of Scotiabank's popular<I> Scotiapay</I>, <I>Scotiapay Plus</I> and <I>ScotiaHR</I> lines of payroll and human resources systems. The agreement calls for ADP to manage the administration, service and support functions of the combined payroll services, while Scotiabank will be responsible for the marketing and selling functions.  The new Scotiabank/ADP joint services should be available by November 1, 1996.<p>



"Scotiabank's marketing and sales network will give ADP wider coverage in Canada, and allow us to grow in the marketplace," said Mr. Rod Dobson, President, ADP Canada.  "Bank customers will now have access to the products and technology of one of the world's leading payroll service companies."<p>



Automatic Data Processing, Inc., with over $3 billion in revenue and 350,000 clients, is one of the largest independent computing service firms in the world.  Employer Services, Brokerage Services, Dealer Services and Claims Services are the Company's four largest businesses.<p>



Scotiabank, with over $152 billion in assets, is Canada's most internationally diverse bank with 1,459 branches and offices in 47 countries around the world. <p>

<h2>Panama student wins Scotiabank Merit Scholarship to Queen's University</h2>



<B>PANAMA</B> -- In a news conference here today, Scotiabank announced that Loraine Chial of Panama is the 1996 recipient of the Scotiabank Merit Scholarship to Queen's University in Canada.  Ms. Chial is a graduate of the Instituto Panamericano and plans to study computer science at Queen's.<p>  

"We are extremely pleased that a student from Panama is this year's winner of the Scotiabank Merit Scholarship.  It is a strong testament to the quality of education that is available here," said Robert Pitfield, Scotiabank's Senior Vice-President for the Caribbean Region.  "Scotiabank believes that a post-secondary education is a key factor in one's personal development, and we are certain that Loraine Chial will both enjoy and succeed in her time at Queen's."<p>



The Scotiabank Merit Scholarship is the result of a C$300,000 donation the Bank made to Queen's University several years ago.  It is a full scholarship, and is renewable annually for the duration of a four-year undergraduate program, subject to the student maintaining a first-class standing each year.  It is valued at C$20,000 per student per year.  <p>



Scholarship applicants are assessed by Queen's University.  Criteria include the successful completion of required subjects, involvement in their community, fluency in English, and the submission of an essay on the student's commitment to the social, political or economic development of their home country.   Founded in 1841, Queen's is one of Canada's premier universities, and has produced nearly 40 Rhodes Scholars.  Its student population numbers about 11,000, and represents more than 70 countries from around the world.<p>



"To have a Scotiabank Merit Scholarship winner come from Panama is truly exciting, and we look forward to following Loraine's success as she studies in Canada," said Alberto Tarabotta, Manager of the Bank's branch in Panama.<p>



Scotiabank is one of North America's largest financial institutions, with assets of C$152 billion, and operates in 47 countries around the world.  It is also the largest bank in the Caribbean, with more than 200 branches and offices in over 20 countries in the region.<p>

<h2>Roland, Manitoba student wins Scotiabank/Canadian Merit Scholarship Foundation 

National Award</h2>







<B>WINNIPEG</B> -- Tara Phillips, who recently graduated from Carman Collegiate Institute, has been named winner of the Scotiabank/Canadian Merit Scholarship National Award.  The Roland, Manitoba student will receive $14,000, which will be used to pay for her residence costs at the University of Waterloo over the next four years.<p>



"The student chosen to receive the Scotiabank/CMSF National Award must be a truly outstanding young person -- and Tara certainly fits that description," said Robert Cluett, Executive Director of the Canadian Merit Scholarship Foundation.  "She had an impressive academic record, is very involved in her local community, and we expect her to be a great asset to her university community in the years ahead."<p>



"Scotiabank has always been a strong supporter of education, and our pledge to the Canadian Merit Scholarship Foundation is a demonstration of this commitment," said John Kowalski, Assistant General Manager of Scotiabank's Manitoba and Northwest Ontario region.  "We were especially proud to learn that this year's winner is a Manitoban, and we are certain that Tara will continue to build on her outstanding high school achievements as she studies at Waterloo."<p>



In addition to the National Award presented to Ms. Phillips, Scotiabank also sponsored six Regional Awards, valued at $1,000 each, for outstanding graduating students across Canada.  The CMSF Awards program was established in 1989 to recognize students who demonstrate character, leadership potential and a commitment to the community.   <p>



Scotiabank is Canada's most international bank, with assets of $152 billion and 1,460 branches and offices in 47 countries around the world.  The Bank opened in Manitoba in 1882, and today operates 46 branches in Manitoba and Northwest Ontario.<p>

<h2>Scotiabank and Business Development Bank of Canada announce strategic alliance to help small business join the big leagues</h2>



<B>TORONTO</B> -- Scotiabank and the Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) today announced a strategic alliance to provide Canada's small and medium-sized businesses with greater access to a wider range of the financial and management services available from both banks.  This partnership will enable many entrepreneurs -- particularly those in emerging industries such as knowledge-based and exporting -- to obtain more financing than might otherwise be possible through traditional channels.<p>  



"Entrepreneurs in fast-paced industries must seize market opportunities with lightning speed, or risk missing out.  Often this requires immediate access to financing.  This program is designed to give innovative entrepreneurs the financing and growth-management advice they require to embrace traditional business life cycle challenges, and expand in the quickest, most profitable possible way," said Dieter Jentsch, Scotiabank's Senior Vice-President for Canadian Commercial Banking.<p>



"Entering this alliance allows BDC to better address the financing needs of companies in emerging markets, particularly knowledge-based and export-oriented firms," said Fran¡ois Beaudoin, BDC President & Chief Executive Officer. "BDC's participation in the program enhances our role as a complementary lender to other financial institutions.  Under our new mandate, we have introduced innovative financing to support firms in emerging markets.  Together with Scotiabank we will now be able to meet their needs more effectively."<p>



Businesses wanting to take advantage of this program must have less than 100 employees and annual total sales of less than $10 million.  These firms will have demonstrated management competency and commitment, with management having a stake in the business. 

The program is structured so that Scotiabank will provide primary banking services to program participants, including: business banking accounts; operating lines of credit and term loans; export financing and other trade services (such as letters of credit); equipment and inventory lease financing; cash management services such as automated payroll; electronic banking services such as Scotia 2020 &reg; (automated merchant VISA); and foreign exchange services. <p> 



The BDC will provide, on a case-by-case basis, loans and services complimentary to those offered by Scotiabank, including:<p>  

<Ul>

<Li>Patient Capital&reg; program: an equity-type financing alternative to provide long-term	capital under flexible repayment terms to businesses in emerging, volatile or cyclical industries, who nevertheless show high long-term growth potential.<p>

<Li>	Venture Loan&reg; program: a hybrid financing instrument where clients borrow funds on the strength of their firm's earnings record, management capabilities, and strong growth potential. The loan is repaid from a percentage of the clients' annual profits.<p>

<Li>	Working Capital for Growth program: a "top-up" loan which provides the critical extra financing that many small business need to capitalize on opportunities for growth.  The actual amount of the loan is based on the firm's cash flow requirements as well as inventory levels and receivables.<p>

<Li>New Exporters Training and Counselling program (NEXPRO&reg;): a program to help  	entrepreneurs broaden their knowledge of the export process, develop a realistic export plan and implement their own export strategy.<p>

</Ul><p>	  



Scotiabank will initially deliver this program through its Commercial Banking Centres in Ottawa, York Region, Saskatoon, and Burnaby, B.C., with national rollout occurring over the course of the next few months.  BDC will offer the program through its corresponding offices in Ottawa, Scarborough, Saskatoon and Vancouver.

<h2>Scotiabank Commodity Price Index soars in May</h2>





<B>TORONTO</B>  -- Scotiabank's Commodity Price Index, which measures price trends in Canada's major exports, posted a strong gain in May, climbing by 5 per cent to a level 11.3  per cent higher than a year earlier.<p>



	Surging agricultural prices combined with solid gains in the Forest Product and Oil & Gas Indices more than offset a slight decline in Metals & Minerals.  A major highlight of May's Index was the rise in the Forest Product Index -- the first increase since September 1995.<p>  



	While commodity prices may ease seasonally over the summer months, G7 economic activity is picking up, indicating that a second leg of cyclical price gains will begin later this year.  Japan's economy experienced a 12.7 per cent growth spurt in the first quarter of 1996, led by strong consumer spending and public works programs.  However, a slower pace is expected over the balance of 1996.<p>

Other highlights include:<p>

<Ul>

<Li>Pulp producers announce a US$60 per tonne price increase for July.

<Li>Lumber prices surged, more than offsetting a further decline in newsprint prices.

<Li>Canadian natural gas producers continue to benefit from strong eastern U.S. export markets.

<Li>Wheat prices leapt to another record.

<h2>Expect "made-in-Canada" interest rates -- at least for now, Scotiabank economists say</h2>



<B>TORONTO</B>  -- Low inflation, record trade surpluses and a big improvement in government finances have been supporting a "made-in-Canada" monetary policy, Scotiabank's economists said in their latest Global Economic Outlook, released today.  Nevertheless, a rising trend in U.S. interest rates will pull Canadian rates higher, likely in late 1996.<p>    



"The Bank of Canada has eased monetary policy four times since the start of the year, with three of these actions occurring independently of the Federal Reserve," observed Warren Jestin, Senior Vice-President and Chief Economist.  "As a result, domestic short-term rates have dropped significantly below U.S. levels -- a rare occurrence.<p>



"Looking ahead, stronger growth and concern about an impending build-up in American inflation will likely nudge U.S. rates higher after mid-1996," he said.  "With money market spreads already negative, the Bank of Canada will be hard-pressed to buck this rising U.S. trend.  As a result, we can expect to see domestic interest rates increasing by year-end."<p>



The expected increase in Canadian borrowing costs, along with further fiscal retrenchment, will limit gains in domestic demand, Scotiabank's economists predict.  Nevertheless, the revival in the U.S. and Canada's strong export orientation will lead to improved output growth over the next eighteen months.<p>



Scotiabank expects Canada's gross domestic product to grow by 1.8 per cent this year and 2.5 per cent in 1997.  This growth will be fuelled by increasing exports to the improving economies of the U.S., Japan and Europe. <p>



"A pick-up in consumer spending and housing will more than offset the fiscal drag from all levels of government," Mr. Jestin predicted.  "Take-home pay will be bolstered by more private-sector hiring and slightly stronger wage gains.  Household confidence will improve, as the financial strains that have dominated the 1990s finally begin to dissipate."



While exports are no longer growing at the double-digit pace of the last two years, stronger American activity and higher commodity prices will underpin sales in the year ahead, the report says.  Shipments of motor vehicles and parts will set another record as new capacity comes on stream.  Agricultural receipts are benefitting from sharply higher prices for wheat as well as increased shipments of processed products.  The high-tech sector, including telecommunications, computer equipment and software, is also registering impressive gains.<p>



"Exports have provided a vital offset to sub-par domestic activity," Mr. Jestin said.  "Canada is already the most internationally oriented of the major industrial nations, with nearly half of private sector activity geared to export markets.  We expect this outward focus to intensify, particularly as domestic producers explore opportunities in Asia and Latin America." <p>



The report notes that the ratio of government debt-to-output -- a key measure of fiscal stress -- will peak over the next year.  Combined federal/provincial deficits are slated to drop to roughly $25 billion by 1997 -- a remarkable turnaround from the record shortfall of over $65 billion reached in the 1992/93 fiscal year.<p>



"The massive restructuring implied by government downsizing will have a profound impact on local governments as well as on the delivery of health, education and social services," observed Mr. Jestin.  "However, it will also create widespread opportunities for the private sector to fill the gap."<p>



In a new companion report called Provincial Pulse, Scotiabank's economists predict that economic activity will continue to shift west.  Alberta and British Columbia are picked as the nation's top performers.  Across the Prairies, diversification into services will reinforce traditional resource strengths. <p>



Despite considerable fiscal drag, Ontario's economic growth will keep pace with the national average this year and next, propelled by strengthening exports.  In Quebec, a shift to a tighter fiscal policy will soften consumer spending, although export gains will maintain some economic momentum.  Consumer spending in most of Atlantic Canada will receive a shot in the arm from the proposed GST harmonization.<p>



"Overall," Mr. Jestin concluded, "improving business conditions should lead to solid job creation in the private sector through 1997."

<h2>Alberta will be Canada's top economic performer, Scotiabank economists predict</h2>



<B>TORONTO</B>  -- Alberta will top the provincial growth charts both this year and next, according to a report released today by Scotiabank's economists.  Solid export gains and stronger-than-expected commodity prices will contribute to a provincial growth rate of 2.6 per cent in 1996 and just over 3 per cent next year. <p>



"Oilpatch drilling activity has been significantly stronger than earlier anticipated," noted Janet Slasor, Senior Economist.  "Major new oil sands investment is proceeding, aided by the new generic royalty regime."<p>



"Ongoing diversification into petrochemicals, telecommunications and forest products indicate the increasing depth of Alberta's economy," she added.  "In addition, Alberta's low tax competitive advantage will be further enhanced by the phasing out of the property tax on manufacturing machinery and equipment."<p>



"On the fiscal side, Alberta's shift from deficits to surpluses has been achieved through major spending cuts, with a big assist from a healthy economy and strong resource revenues," said Mary Webb, Senior Economist.  "With a robust economy, budget surpluses over the next three fiscal years are likely to further reduce the debt by at least $1 billion." <p>



These trends are described in a new Scotiabank report called <U>Provincial Pulse</U>, which provides a detailed economic forecast and fiscal analysis for each province across Canada.  Overall, Scotiabank expects that the western provinces, led by Alberta and British Columbia, will continue to dominate economic expansion.  Exports will remain the growth locomotive in most provinces, supported by strong international demand, a competitive dollar and a favourable product mix in many manufacturing industries.  While the ratio of provincial debt-to-output is peaking, progress in paying down debt is likely to be gradual due largely to federal transfer reductions.

<h2>British Columbia's economy is back on the fast track, Scotiabank economists say</h2>





<B>TORONTO</B>  -- After skipping a beat last year, British Columbia's economic growth will accelerate to almost three per cent in 1997, according to a report released today by Scotiabank's economists.  The province should also see a drop in the unemployment rate to 8.3 per cent -- the lowest level in sixteen years.<p>



"Trade will continue to target the Pacific Rim," said Janet Slasor, Senior Economist. "Japan -- the destination of roughly one-quarter of B.C.'s shipments -- is recovering after being the weakest performer among G7 countries over the past four years.  This will provide some stimulus to export sales, as will rapid growth in other Asian countries. <p>



"In the forestry sector, the recent softwood lumber agreement between B.C., Quebec, Ontario and Alberta will impose fees on shipments exceeding an annual threshold of 14.7 billion board feet," Ms. Slasor continued.  "Producers will attempt to offset lower U.S. shipments by shifting to higher value-added wood products and diverting more sales to offshore markets."<p>



On the fiscal side, Senior Economist Mary Webb notes that B.C. consumers will benefit from a cut in the personal income tax rate this July, with a similar cut expected next year.<p>



"Targets outlined in the Debt Management Plan require a significant increase in direct debt repayments over the next three years," she added.<p>



These trends are described in a new Scotiabank report called Provincial Pulse, which provides a detailed economic forecast and fiscal analysis for each province across Canada.  Overall, Scotiabank expects that the western provinces, led by Alberta and British Columbia, will continue to dominate economic expansion.  Exports will remain the growth locomotive in most provinces, supported by strong international demand, a competitive dollar and a favourable product mix in many manufacturing industries.  While the ratio of provincial debt-to-output is peaking, progress in paying down debt is likely to be gradual due largely to federal transfer reductions.

<h2>Manitoba's economy poised for solid growth in 1997, Scotiabank economists say</h2>



<B>TORONTO</B>  -- Manitoba's economy is firing on all cylinders and will achieve solid growth over the next eighteen months, according to a report released today by Scotiabank's economists.  Ongoing expansion in food processing and growing diversification into telecommunications are building on further gains in the resource sector.<p>



"Farm incomes will benefit from record wheat prices, and a buoyant hog industry which is now almost equal in value to the cattle sector," observed Janet Slasor, Senior Economist.  "Significant capacity expansion in food processing points to further output gains." <p>



"The service sector is also expanding its reach," she added.  "Call centre activity is increasing significantly and Winnipeg is actively promoting its role as an air cargo hub for North America."<p>



"On the fiscal side, expenditures per capita will remain substantially below most other provinces," noted Mary Webb, Senior Economist.  "Another budget surplus is projected this year, and the first debt repayment is slated for fiscal 1997/98."<p>



These trends are described in a new Scotiabank report called <U>Provincial Pulse</U>, which provides a detailed economic forecast and fiscal analysis for each province across Canada.  Overall, Scotiabank expects that the western provinces, led by Alberta and British Columbia, will continue to dominate economic expansion.

<h2>Private sector growth keeps New Brunswick's economic performance on track</h2>



<B>TORONTO</B>  -- New Brunswick will remain near the top of Atlantic Canada's economic growth chart over the next eighteen months, according to a report released today by Scotiabank's economists.  While fiscal restraint and defense cutbacks will restrain the pace of activity, rapid diversification into telecommunication services, particularly call centres, is helping to bolster private sector growth. <p>



Scotiabank's economists are expecting New Brunswick to further increase capital spending, as investments proceed across a broad range of manufacturing industries.  Combined with ongoing investment in the national highway system, New Brunswick will likely post substantially stronger gains in capital spending than most other provinces this year.<p>



"Private sector growth in New Brunswick is being boosted by the province's efforts to specialize in call centres," said Janet Slasor, Senior Economist.  "The call centre business will get a further lift from additional high-tech investments coming on stream." <p>



 "The provincial retail sales outlook is also quite favourable," said Mary Webb, Senior Economist.  "The GST harmonization is expected to lift purchasing power, saving the average family about $250 annually."<p>



These trends are described in a new Scotiabank report called Provincial Pulse, which provides a detailed economic forecast and fiscal analysis for each province across Canada.  Overall, Scotiabank expects that the western provinces, led by Alberta and British Columbia, will continue to dominate economic expansion.  Exports will remain the growth locomotive in most provinces, supported by strong international demand, a competitive dollar and a favourable product mix in many manufacturing industries.  While the ratio of provincial debt-to-output is peaking, progress in paying down debt is likely to be gradual due largely to federal transfer reductions.

<h2>Longer-term outlook bright for Newfoundland economy</h2>

 



<B>TORONTO</B>  -- Newfoundland's economy remains in a period of transition and will record minimal growth over the next two years, according to a report released today by Scotiabank's economists.  Nevertheless, the outlook beyond 1997 is much brighter, due to the potential development of mineral deposits at Voisey's Bay and offshore oil exploration.<p>



Scotiabank's economists expect mining activity to remain Newfoundland's main engine of growth through the turn of the century.  They note that the Voisey's Bay discovery has prompted a flurry of activity across the province, with nearly 250,000 claims staked during 1995 -- more than eleven times the previous year's level.<p>



"The fishery will benefit over the longer term from new foreign markets and alternate methods," observed Janet Slasor, Senior Economist.  "Asia, for example, represents a market for species not previously harvested on a commercial basis.  Aquaculture production rose by 55 per cent in 1995 and is expected to generate about 1,300 person years of employment by the year 2000." <p>



"On the fiscal side, next year's harmonization of the GST will result in the largest single tax reduction in Newfoundland's history," said Mary Webb, Senior Economist.  "We expect that this sales tax reduction of close to five percentage points will help to support consumer spending and demand." <p>



These trends are described in a new Scotiabank report called Provincial Pulse, which provides a detailed economic forecast and fiscal analysis for each province across Canada.  Overall, Scotiabank expects that the western provinces, led by Alberta and British Columbia, will continue to dominate economic expansion.  Exports will remain the growth locomotive in most provinces, supported by strong international demand, a competitive dollar and a favourable product mix in many manufacturing industries.  While the ratio of provincial debt-to-output is finally peaking, progress in paying down debt is likely to be gradual due largely to federal transfer reductions.

<h2>Nova Scotia's economy to gain momentum next year, Scotiabank economists say</h2>







<B>TORONTO</B> -- Nova Scotia's economic growth is expected to strengthen over the next year, due mainly to new construction and improving conditions in Halifax, according to a report released today by Scotiabank economists.  Fishing remains the number one export, however, growth will also depend on the province's service and construction industries.<p>  



Scotiabank's economists note that Halifax's 8.3 per cent unemployment rate is the eighth lowest jobless rate among Canada's 22 major cities.  The city is experiencing further tourism investment, while the Port of Halifax's heavy traffic has strengthened transportation services.<p>



"Fishing, despite ongoing adjustments, remains Nova Scotia's top export," observed Janet Slasor, Senior Economist.  "However, the composition of the catch has shifted, with shellfish accounting for three-quarters of landed values last year. <p>



"Construction will boost the economy over the next few years, as non-residential investments and infrastructure improvements take place," Ms. Slasor continued.  "Weakness in the coal industry overhangs the mining sector, but proposed natural gas projects could provide an important boost."<p>



"Retail sales will rebound as Nova Scotians benefit from economic improvement and two tax breaks in 1997," said Mary Webb, Senior Economist.  "The provincial sales tax will decline from 11.8 to eight per cent with the GST harmonization in April, 1997, and the provincial personal income tax rate will drop 3.4 per cent in July."<p>  



These trends are described in a new Scotiabank report called Provincial Pulse, which provides a detailed economic forecast and fiscal analysis for each province across Canada.  Overall, Scotiabank expects that the western provinces, led by Alberta and British Columbia, will continue to dominate economic expansion.  Exports will remain the growth locomotive in most provinces, supported by strong international demand, a competitive dollar and a favourable product mix in many manufacturing industries.  While the ratio of provincial debt-to-output is peaking, progress in paying down debt is likely to be gradual due largely to federal transfer reductions.

<h2>Ontario economy set to accelerate this year, Scotiabank economists say</h2>



<B>TORONTO</B>  -- While Ontario's economy was slow out of the starting blocks this year, the pace of activity is expected to pick up over the next eighteen months, according to a report released today by Scotiabank's economists.  With over one-half of its output shipped south of the border, Ontario is well-positioned to take advantage of strengthening U.S. demand.<p>



"Exports of motor vehicles and high-tech equipment will continue to lead the province's growth," predicted Janet Slasor, Senior Economist.  "Ontario's focus on popular light trucks and vans, plus new Japanese investment, will further boost shipments.  Sizeable investments announced by Toyota and Honda are proceeding, alongside additional spending by the Big Three North American automakers.<p>     



"Housing demand is responding to the dramatic improvement in affordability and tight rental markets," Ms. Slasor added.  "Housing starts are expected to rebound to 43,000 units this year, after plunging to a 43-year low in 1995."<p>



"Despite unprecedented fiscal restraint, Ontario's expansion is expected to keep pace with the national average," commented Mary Webb, Senior Economist.  "The bulk of the province's spending reductions will be implemented this fiscal year, but consumers will benefit from personal income tax cuts starting in July." <p>



These trends are described in a new Scotiabank report called Provincial Pulse, which provides a detailed economic forecast and fiscal analysis for each province across Canada.  Overall, Scotiabank expects that the western provinces, led by Alberta and British Columbia, will continue to dominate economic expansion.  Exports will remain the growth locomotive in most provinces, supported by strong international demand, a competitive dollar and a favourable product mix in many manufacturing industries.  While the ratio of provincial debt-to-output is peaking, progress in paying down debt is likely to be gradual due largely to federal transfer reductions.

<h2>P.E.I.'s economic growth slows but outlook is upbeat</h2>





<B>TORONTO</B>  -- While growth in Prince Edward Island will slow as the Fixed Link bridge is completed, gains in the Island's mainstay industries -- potato processing, the lobster fishery and tourism -- will underpin economic expansion in 1996 and 1997, according to a report released today by Scotiabank's economists.<p>  



Scotiabank's economists note that the reopening of export markets in the U.S. and Mexico is encouraging increased potato acreage and processing capabilities throughout the province.<p>



"While the lobster fishery is enjoying strong prices, landings may fall 20 to 30 per cent this year as concerns over depleting stocks come into play and government regulations change," said Janet Slasor, Senior Economist. <p>



"Completion of the Fixed Link will have a major impact on P.E.I.," Ms. Slasor continued.  "While construction activity will slow substantially, tourism is expected to benefit from the historic shift from ferry service to a bridge connection.  In addition, the province should realize lower retail prices with the reduced transportation costs provided by the Fixed Link.  This will allow Island retailers to become more competitive with mainland merchants, propelling retail sales above the five per cent gain recorded last year." <p>



"On the fiscal side, strong economic growth is boosting P.E.I.'s revenues, partially offsetting reduced federal transfers," commented Mary Webb, Senior Economist.  "P.E.I.'s fiscal reform has been undertaken to date without public sector layoffs."<p> 

 	

These trends are described in a new Scotiabank report called Provincial Pulse, which provides a detailed economic forecast and fiscal analysis for each province across Canada.  Overall, Scotiabank expects that the western provinces, led by Alberta and British Columbia, will continue to dominate economic expansion.  Exports will remain the growth locomotive in most provinces, supported by strong international demand, a competitive dollar and a favourable product mix in many manufacturing industries.  While the ratio of provincial debt-to-output is peaking, progress in paying down debt is likely to be gradual due largely to federal transfer reductions.

<h2>Exports to help a tight Quebec economy, Scotiabank economists say</h2>



<B>TORONTO</B>  -- Improving U.S. markets, favourable resource prices and strong demand in several manufacturing industries will support export growth in Quebec over the next two years, according to a report released today by Scotiabank economists.  However, the economy's performance will be constrained by ongoing consumer caution and fiscal restraint. 

"Quebec is embarking on a significant deficit reduction program in a period of relatively slow growth," observed Mary Webb, Senior Economist.  "With over three per cent of program spending being cut both this year and next, the degree of fiscal drag on the economy will be substantial.  The government is also tightening a variety of tax breaks, increasing user fees and initiating stricter revenue collection.<p>



"However," she added, "Quebec has a number of healthy export industries to sustain growth."<p>



"Strong markets currently exist for Quebec's aircraft and telecommunications products and Montreal's pharmaceutical industry is continuing to expand," observed Janet Slasor, Senior Economist.  "The province is Canada's largest newsprint and groundwood paper producer, and will benefit from the stabilization of newsprint prices later this year."  <p>



These trends are described in a new Scotiabank report called Provincial Pulse, which provides a detailed economic forecast and fiscal analysis for each province across Canada.  Overall, Scotiabank expects that the western provinces, led by Alberta and British Columbia, will continue to dominate economic expansion.  Exports will remain the growth locomotive in most provinces, supported by strong international demand, a competitive dollar and a favourable product mix in many manufacturing industries.  While the ratio of provincial debt-to-output is peaking, progress in paying down debt is likely to be gradual due largely to federal transfer reductions.

<h2>Saskatchewan economy to bounce back after a weak 1995, Scotiabank economists say</h2>





<B>TORONTO</B>  -- Saskatchewan's economy should gain strength over the next two years, according to a report released today by Scotiabank's economists.  They predict the province's economy will expand by two per cent in 1996 and 2.5 per cent the following year.<p>



"Saskatchewan farmers will continue to benefit from robust world markets for wheat and most other grains," said Janet Slasor, Senior Economist.  "Global wheat inventories are near 20-year lows and harsh weather conditions have left nearly half of the U.S. winter wheat crop rated of poor quality.  A payment from the Western Grain Transition Payments Program to compensate for the elimination of the Crow Rate subsidy will benefit farmers, boosting their income and investment power by just over $900 million.<p>   

   

"While potash production is expected to decline slightly after last year's strong rise, uranium and gold output are forecast to be buoyant," Ms. Slasor continued.  <p>



Senior Economist Mary Webb noted that Saskatchewan will post a budget surplus of $358 million in the 1996-97 fiscal year, boosted by a one-time $350 million dividend from the sale of a significant share of its ownership in the uranium company, Cameco Corporation. <p>



"The province is committed to maintaining current spending on social programs and plans to make up virtually all of the announced cuts in federal funding", Ms. Webb said.  "As a result, the province is further streamlining other government programs."<p>



These trends are described in a new Scotiabank report called Provincial Pulse, which provides a detailed economic forecast and fiscal analysis for each province across Canada.  Overall, Scotiabank expects that the western provinces, led by Alberta and British Columbia, will continue to dominate economic expansion.  Exports will remain the growth locomotive in most provinces, supported by strong international demand, a competitive dollar and a favourable product mix in many manufacturing industries.  While the ratio of provincial debt-to-output is peaking, progress in paying down debt is likely to be gradual due largely to federal transfer reductions.

<h2>Scotiabank holds five-fold celebration in Prince George</h2>





<B>PRINCE GEORGE</B> -- Today was a special day for Scotiabank, the University of Northern British Columbia, the citizens of Prince George, and for all aspiring university students in Northern B.C.<p>





	Scotiabank today announced it will donate $75,000 to the University of Northern British Columbia (UNBC).  The donation will be structured so that two-thirds of the funds are dedicated to supporting UNBC's program for community-based learning through distance education technology -- a tool to enable students to pursue their degree off the main campus, using video, computer and Internet technologies.<p>





	The remaining funds will be allocated to bursaries and scholarships for students from northern communities, especially those who are in special circumstances, such as the physically challenged.<p>





	"A well-educated Canadian populace is vital to maintaining global competitiveness, and Scotiabank is committed to supporting initiatives that improve quality and access to education," said Mr. George Marlatte, Scotiabank's Senior


Vice-President, British Columbia and Yukon Region.<p>





	"One of the very highest priorities of UNBC is to ensure that our courses are available to all northerners who could benefit from them.  Developing effective distance education technology is critical to our mission," said Dr. Charles Jago, President of UNBC.<p>





	Scotiabank is proactive in supporting access to education and technology in education.  In February, 1996, the Bank announced a plan to establish the Scotiabank Distance Education Centre, along with the University of New Brunswick.<p>





	Scotiabank has also been proactive in improving accessibility to financial services for people with special needs.  The bank offers large print cheques and deposit slips, braille Cashstop keypads, braille VISA statements and account statements, and TTY/TDD telephone assistance for customers with hearing impairments.  Scotiabank also offers telephone banking in British Columbia 24 hours a day, seven days a week, so customers can do their banking whenever, and from wherever, they choose. <p>





	"Scotiabank's donation to UNBC is just the most recent example of our longstanding commitment to supporting educational and technological excellence, as well as our involvement in supporting the communities we serve," said Mr. Marlatte.<p>





	The announcement of the donation to UNBC was made today in Prince George, site of the main campus of the University of Northern British Columbia.  It was just one of many festivities staged today by Scotiabank's four Prince George branches: <p>


<Ul>

<Li>		Scotiabank's main Prince George branch celebrated its 50th anniversary today.


<Li>		The New College Heights branch staged its grand	opening. 


<Li>		The Spruceland Shopping Centre branch celebrated its grand reopening after major renovations to upgrade the 		branch and improve customer service.  


<Li>		Finally, the Hart Highway branch held a customer appreciation day to pay tribute to the Bank's most valuable assets--it's customers.  


</Ul>  


<p>


	Scotiabank has 127 branches throughout British Columbia, 15 of which are located in the province's northern communities.  Throughout Canada, Scotiabank serves customers in 1,147 branches.<p>

<h2>Scotiabank makes university a reality for students from the north</h2>





<B>TORONTO</B> -- Scotiabank today announced it will donate $75,000 to the University of Northern British Columbia (UNBC) to support a program that makes university accessible to students from remote communities.<p>





	Scotiabank's donation to UNBC will be structured so that two-thirds of the funds are dedicated to supporting UNBC's program for community-based learning through distance education technology -- a tool to enable students to pursue their degree off the main campus, using video, computer and Internet technologies.<p>  





	The remaining funds will be allocated to bursaries and scholarships for students from northern communities, especially students who have special circumstances, such as the physically challenged.<p>





	"A well-educated Canadian populace is vital to maintaining global competitiveness," said Mr. George Marlatte, Scotiabank's Senior Vice-President, British Columbia and Yukon Region.  "Scotiabank is committed to supporting initiatives that improve quality and access to education."<p>





	Mr. Marlatte believes Internet technology may soon play a key role in driving down the cost of education, making university more affordable and accessible for students than ever before.<p>





	Accessibility is particularly important to people in remote communities.  Such people need and deserve the same opportunities as others for a university education, according to Marlatte.<p> 





	"Business has a responsibility to ensure it supports educational programs like those of UNBC -- programs aimed at meeting real needs and teaching real skills that benefit students, their communities, and ultimately the entire country. UNBC's program is valuable and relevant to Canadians from all walks of life," Marlatte said.<p>





	"One of the very highest priorities of UNBC is to ensure that our courses are available to all northerners that can benefit from them.  Developing effective distance education technology is critical to this mission," said Dr. Charles Jago, President of UNBC.<p>





	Scotiabank is a proactive supporter of technology to improve access to education.  In February, 1996, the Bank announced a plan to establish the Scotiabank Distance Education Centre, along with the University of New Brunswick.  This innovative program uses state-of-the-art telecommunications technology to provide alternative learning options for students.<p>





	In September, 1995, Scotiabank contributed funds to enable Carleton University to expand its internal electronic communications infrastructure.  Called CHAT, the program enables students and faculty to electronically share class notes, research, and assignments, as well as access advanced software development tools, and renowned academic materials from university libraries worldwide.<p>





	Scotiabank has also been proactive in improving access to financial services, particularly for the visually and hearing impaired.  Scotiabank offers large print cheques and deposit slips, Braille Cashstop keypads, Braille VISA statements and account statements, and TTY/TDD telephone assistance for customers with hearing impairments. <p>





	"Scotiabank's donation to UNBC is just the most recent example of our longstanding commitment to supporting educational and technological excellence, as well as our involvement in supporting the communities we serve," said Mr. Marlatte.  <p>





	Scotiabank has 1,147 branches throughout Canada, 17 of which are located in Northern British Columbia, the Yukon and the Northwest Terrories. <p>

<h2>Scotiabank launches telephone banking in the Prairies</h2>





<b>CALGARY --</B> Scotiabank today announced the launch of its telephone banking service, TeleScotia, in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba.  The new service allows Scotiabank customers in the Prairies to use their telephones to pay bills, check balances, transfer funds, review transaction history and check mutual fund accounts.<p>





	"TeleScotia lets our customers do their banking anywhere they want, anytime they want," said Bob Lounsbury, Vice-President, Card Products and Self-Service Delivery, Scotiabank. Accessed through a toll free number, 1-800-BNS-1234 (1-800-267-1234), the service is available seven days a week, 24 hours a day, anywhere in North America.  Service is available in four languages -- English, French, Cantonese and Mandarin.<p>  





	TeleScotia was piloted in Southwestern Ontario and launched in British Columbia last month.  Today's launch in the Prairies is part of the Bank's plan to expand the service from coast to coast by this fall.  The service uses the most up-to-date voice response technology available, and is designed to adapt to future innovations in communications.<p>  





	Customer use of the service has been growing steadily, and the number of companies that accept bill payments through TeleScotia is increasing.<p>





	"We already have more than 400 companies and utilities accepting payments by TeleScotia," commented Mr. Lounsbury.<p>





	"We like to give our customers a choice.  Now they can bank by telephone, ABM, or within our branches," said Mr. Lounsbury.  "In fact, when a customer uses TeleScotia, they can even choose between automated or personal service," he added.<p>  








	Scotiabank is one of North America's premier financial institutions with $152 billion in assets, operating 1460 branches and offices in 46 countries around the world.<p>

<h2>Scotiabank reports strong second quarter results</h2>



<b>TORONTO --</b> Scotiabank today reported net income of $262 million in the second quarter ended April 30, 1996, an increase of $51 million or 24% from the same period a year ago.<p>



     "Productivity gains and a strong performance across all business lines contributed to our record results this quarter," said Mr. Peter Godsoe, Chairman and CEO, Scotiabank.  "During the first six months of fiscal 1996, 60% of the Bank's net income was earned in International, Corporate and Investment Banking, with the latter two businesses operating both in Canada and internationally.  The remaining 40% was earned by the Bank's Canadian retail and commercial branch business."<p>  



     <B>Earnings per share</B> rose sharply to $1.01 in the second quarter from $0.82 in the same period a year ago.  <B>Return on equity</B> increased to 16.1% from 14.2%, and <B>return on assets</B> improved to 0.71% from 0.63%.<p>



     <B>Net income for the first six months of fiscal 1996</B> was $511 million, an increase of $90 million or 21% over the same period a year ago.  <B>Earnings per share</B> of $1.96 were up from $1.64; <B>return on equity</B> of 15.6% increased from 14.2%; and <B>return on assets</B> improved to 0.70% from 0.63%.<p>



     <B>Net interest income</B> for the quarter was $868 million, an increase of $51 million or 6% from last year.  The increase was due mainly to business volume growth in mortgage and personal lending in Canada, and in the Bank's international operations in the Caribbean and the Pacific.  There were also higher gains from the sale of securities as the Bank continued to take advantage of buoyant equity markets.<p>



     <B>Non-interest income</B> was $429 million in the second quarter, a substantial increase of $131 million or 44% year-over-year.  Investment banking revenues rebounded from the same quarter a year ago, particularly in retail brokerage, underwriting fees, foreign exchange and derivatives.  In addition, the Bank earned higher revenues from corporate banking credit fees, new products such as debit cards, and greater customer activity in credit cards and mutual funds.<p>

         

     "Scotiabank enjoyed a particularly successful RRSP season this year," said Mr. Godsoe.  "Nearly 50,000 Canadians used our RRSP Reality Check program to help get started on planning financially for their retirement.  This program, along with other initiatives such as our 2-year stock-indexed GIC, helped to increase our RRSP deposits by $1.3 billion and our Scotia Excelsior Fund assets by $1.2 billion on a year-over-year basis."<p>   

     

     <B>Non-interest expenses</B> for the second quarter were $774 million, an increase of $91 million or 13% over the same period a year ago.  A large portion of this growth was in human resource expenses, including performance-linked compensation associated with Scotia Capital Markets, the launch of a new incentive plan for all Canadian employees and higher employment levels.  Technology related expenses also increased from last year.<p>



     Reflecting a continued emphasis on cost control, the Bank's <B>productivity ratio</B> -- non-interest expenses as a percentage of total revenues -- improved to 58.5% from 60.4% in the same quarter a year ago.<p> 



     "We are continuing to emphasize productivity, enabling us to invest in people and technology to improve customer service," Mr. Godsoe explained.  "After increasing by more than 400 jobs in 1995, Scotiabank's workforce is continuing to grow, to meet the needs created by market share gains and business volume growth.<p>  



     "We view our employees as a significant competitive advantage and aim to provide them with secure and rewarding careers," Mr. Godsoe continued.  "Well-trained and motivated employees deliver superior service to our customers, increasing our market share and, over time, helping us build greater shareholder value."<p> 



     Credit quality continued to improve in the quarter.  <B>Net impaired loans</B> outstanding declined by $111 million from the immediately preceding quarter to $937 million at

April 30, 1996, or 0.9% of total loans and acceptances.  The improvement was partly due to declines in the real estate sector as a result of asset sales.  Net impaired loans in other sectors were virtually unchanged from the prior quarter.<p>



     <B>The full year provision for credit losses</B> is estimated at $380 million, which is 32% lower than the previous year's provision of $560 million.  The loan loss charged in the second quarter was $95 million, a reduction of $7 million year-over-year and unchanged from the immediately preceding quarter.  The Bank's <B>general provision</B> remains at $325 million, one of the highest of the Canadian banks.<p>

                                                        

     At April 30, 1996, there was a substantial surplus of $669 million in the market over book value of the Bank's <B>securities portfolio</B> (which includes developing country bonds), compared to $767 million in the prior quarter.  In addition, the Bank had a surplus of market over book value in its <B>developing country loan portfolio</B> of $192 million, relatively unchanged from the prior quarter.<p>



     Capital funds rose to $11.0 billion as at April 30, 1996, an increase of $573 million from the prior quarter.  The increase included the issuance of $100 million Series 10 preferred shares, $300 million in subordinated debentures and strong earnings growth.<p>



     At quarter end, the <B>Tier 1 capital ratio</B> was 6.78%, an improvement from 6.69% as at January 31, 1996.  The <B>total capital ratio</B> also improved to 9.63% from 9.42% at the end of the prior quarter.<p>



     <B>Total assets</B> rose to $152 billion from $146 billion as at January 31, 1996.  The increase was primarily attributable to increases in securities of $1.1 billion and reverse repurchase agreements of $2.2 billion in the Bank's investment banking operations.  Asset growth was also achieved across most loan portfolios both in Canada and in international operations. <p>



     An increase in the <B>quarterly dividend</B> of three cents per common share was approved by the Board of Directors at today's meeting, raising the quarterly dividend to 34 cents, payable on July 29, 1996, to shareholders of record as of July 2, 1996.<p>

<h2>$200,000 pledge by Scotiabank will benefit Ottawa Civic Hospital's Civic Pride Campaign</h2>











<B>OTTAWA</B> -- Scotiabank today announced that it will donate $200,000 to the Ottawa Civic Hospital's Civic Pride campaign.  The donation, which will be paid over five years, will be used by the Hospital to establish an education facility as part of the Women's Breast Health Centre.<p>





	"Scotiabank has a long-standing relationship with the Ottawa Civic Hospital, and we are extremely pleased to make this donation to this excellent institution," said Al Horsting, Scotiabank's Vice-President, Ottawa and East.  "The hospital is a key factor in the high quality of health care we enjoy here in the National Capital Area, and we expect that the Scotiabank Education Centre will play a significant role in teaching people about this important women's health issue."<p>





	Mr. Horsting will be among 2,000 people attending a fund raising event tonight at the Aberdeen Pavilion to officially launch Civic Pride, the Hospital's $20 million campaign.  One of the highlights of the event will be the recognition of major supporters and campaign volunteers.  More than $7 million has been raised already.<p>


   


	"The generous donation made by Scotiabank to the Civic Pride campaign is a demonstration of the commitment we have seen from hospital staff and volunteers, Ottawa-area businesses, and the local community," said John McLennan, President and CEO of Bell Canada and Chair of the Campaign.  "In these challenging times, it is exciting and gratifying for all of us associated with the Hospital to witness the support this important campaign has already received."<p>





	Associated with the University of Ottawa, the Civic Hospital is the seventh largest teaching hospital in Canada and serves more than 1.5 million residents of eastern Ontario and western Quebec.<p>





	With assets of $145.8 billion, Scotiabank is one of North America's largest financial institutions.  It operates 1,460 offices and branches across Canada, including more than 40 branches in the National Capital Area.

<h2>Latest expansion to give Scotiabank a strategic advantage in the South Asian sub-continent


</h2>








<B>TORONTO</B> -- Expanding on its position as Canada's leading bank in the emerging markets of Asia, Scotiabank announced today that it will open a regional office later this month for India and the South Asian sub-continent in Mumbai (Bombay), India.  Douglas Stewart, who previously served as Senior Vice-President of the Bank's Caribbean operations, will re-locate to Mumbai to oversee the new office.<p>





	"With the eighth largest economy in the world, a population of more than 900 million and a rapidly emerging middle class, India is an ideal market in which to expand Scotiabank's international banking capabilities," said Peter C. Godsoe, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Scotiabank.  "We believe that the region offers tremendous growth potential for financial services, and we plan to leverage our 100 years of international banking experience to gain a strategic advantage in this part of Asia."<p>





	Besides strengthening the Bank's presence in India, the regional office will be responsible for developing business relationships, gathering market information and evaluating the potential for expansion into several other countries in the sub-continent, including Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.  At present, Scotiabank operates branches in Mumbai and New Delhi in India and will open a branch in the southern city of Coimbatore in the second half of 1996.  The country is expected to experience annual economic growth of about five to six per cent for the balance of the decade.<p>





	"Trade between our two countries is approaching $1 billion a year, and Canadian businesses are quickly recognizing the potential of the Indian market, especially in the high-tech and infrastructure sectors, such as power generation, transportation and telecommunications," Mr. Godsoe continued.  "Because Canadian firms have particular strengths in these areas, Scotiabank's enhanced presence in the region puts us in an excellent position to help businesses from both countries capitalize on these opportunities."<p>





	Scotiabank is one of North America's largest financial institutions, with more than C$145 billion in assets and over 34,000 employees worldwide.  It is also Canada's most international bank, with 1,460 branches and offices in 46 countries on five continents.

<h2>Scotiabank to participate significantly in Mexico's recovery, says Chairman</h2>





<b>CANCUN, Mexico, March 18, 1996 --</b> Mexico's economic recovery is under way, and

Scotiabank's investment in Grupo Financiero Inverlat S.A. de C.V. demonstrates its ongoing

commitment to the country, said Peter C. Godsoe, the Bank's Chairman and CEO in a speech here

on Saturday.

<p>

    "Mexico is positioned for growth and we are eager to be part of that by contributing

to Mexico's economic revitalization," he said in an address to the Mexican Bankers Association. 

"On the basis of action taken by the Mexican government and the co-operation that government

received from business and labor, we have full confidence that Mexico will continue on this very

positive track in the years ahead."

<p>

    According to Mr. Godsoe, Canada will play a special role in Mexico's future because

of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the countries' common trading

interests.  "Canada's motives for the NAFTA were largely defensive -- we did not want the

U.S. to develop a hub-and-spoke trade structure, with the U.S. as the hub and Canada, then

Mexico and other countries signing on as the spokes," he pointed out.  "Similarly, Mexico

supported Canada's participation in an effort to gain bargaining strength during the negotiations --

beyond, of course, the obvious gains that the deal would and has generated in Mexico in pure

economic terms."

<p>

    Going forward, Mr. Godsoe predicted that these links will become even more important. 

He said that the development of major trade blocs similar to the NAFTA is inevitable, and will

increase the importance of trade within North and South America.

<p>

    A key factor in the success of the Mexican recovery will continue to be a strong and

healthy financial sector, said Mr. Godsoe.  "It is clear to me that the Mexican government

understands this very well," he said.  "That is why decisive action is being taken to ensure that

there is a strong regulatory system, and to ensure that Mexican financial institutions are well

capitalized, so they can grow and support increased economic activity -- and to ensure that

confidence in the system is maintained in Mexico and throughout international markets."

<p>

    Scotiabank's recent investment in Inverlat -- Mexico's fourth-largest financial services

firm -- was a demonstration of its confidence in the future of the Mexican financial sector,

according to Mr. Godsoe.  On February 15, the Bank announced that it would invest up to

US$225 million to purchase as much as 55% of Inverlat by the year 2000.  The investment,

he said, was consistent with the Bank's strategy of global diversification and its belief that

Mexico's improving economy and growing middle class presents good potential for financial

services.  

<p>

    "This agreement gives us a partnership with a strong management team and it gives

us the opportunity to participate directly and significantly in the Mexican market -- to grow

and prosper as Inverlat and Mexico grow and prosper," said Mr. Godsoe.  "As well, it represents

a very strong vote of confidence in Mexico and in the Mexican financial system.  It is a meaningful

vote of confidence, as it is always easy to be a 'fair weather friend'.  Mexico needs its friends now

-- not tomorrow.

<p>

    "We are very excited about our new partnership and the opportunity to contribute to

the ongoing development of the Mexican economy," he concluded.  "We know full well that

a strong economy needs a strong financial system, and we have every confidence that Mexico

will have just that in the years to come."

<h2>Universities must compete to win funding, says Scotiabank Chairman

and CEO</h2>





<b>TORONTO, March 4, 1996 --</b> Canadian universities are adapting to the

challenges presented by global competition, but the pace of change

must be stepped up, Scotiabank's Chairman and CEO, Peter C. Godsoe

said in a speech here today.<p>



In an address to the Canadian Club of Toronto, Mr. Godsoe said that, 

while Canada already has a number of high-quality

universities -- and while its population is among the best-educated

in the world -- it is increasingly important that the country's

schools establish world-class programs to compete on the same level

as the Harvards, Oxfords and Cambridges of the world.<p>



"The development and maintenance of high performance standards

in education -- for our universities -- and continuously

benchmarking ourselves against the best in the world is, more than

ever before, a key to our ongoing success and productivity," he

said.<p>



"Universities in Canada are developing centres of excellence,

new links with business and new, specialized programs that are

taking us in this direction," he pointed out.  "There are a number

of success stories -- here in Toronto, elsewhere in Ontario and,

indeed, right across the country.  These success stories show we

are, as a country, already heading in a fundamentally new direction

on education."<p>



But, he said, more must be done to support institutional

excellence and speed up the change.  The key challenge, he said, is

to do so in the face of unprecedented cutbacks to government

funding.  "The answer to the funding question has to lie in better

management," he said.  "There are a number of ways to maintain

accessibility while reducing costs, to allow a re-allocation of

resources to support the development of institutional excellence."<p>



Mr. Godsoe pointed to innovative delivery systems, such as the

"virtual classroom" and Internet applications, predicting that such

uses of technology will drive down costs significantly, while

dramatically increasing the accessibility of higher education to

Canadians.  He cited the University of New Brunswick as a leader in

this area of program delivery, through the Scotiabank Distance

Education Centre, which was established by an initial pledge of

$200,000 from the Bank.  He also said that part-time studies and

community colleges would play a greater role in education --

driving down the total cost of the system -- and indicated that a

rationalization of schools, programs and administration is

inevitable.<p>



The key issue with regards to funding, he said, is the basis

on which governments should allocate increasingly scarce financial

resources.  He said that governments have placed an over-emphasis

on rewarding schools based on enrolment, suggesting that funds be

distributed on the basis of competition, and that universities

should be free to vary their fees more widely.<p>



"This would force universities to compete for students, for

bursary and scholarship money," he said.  "It would also make it

easier for students to pick the university they want to attend, for

specific programs and specific areas of excellence.  And it would

make it easier for employers to know where they should go to

recruit the best students in a particular field."<p>



Mr. Godsoe maintained that business has a key role to play in

the future of post-secondary education.  Already, he said, Canada

is at the forefront of co-op education, with the University of

Waterloo being the best example.  "But more is required of business

today," he said.  "It is no longer sufficient to simply provide

donations.  Business has a responsibility to ensure that it

supports institutions financially and in program development,

making sure that programs are aimed at real needs, real skills, and

real benefits to the student and to our community."<p>



In conclusion, Mr. Godsoe said that the importance of offering

high-quality education cannot be understated.  "I believe that our

economic future depends on our ability to create, use and manage

knowledge as effectively -- more effectively -- than the rest of

the world," he said.  "I believe that human skills, that people,

are the only true source of comparative advantage over time.<p>



"And I believe that we have to move towards the forefront of

university education by developing the sort of institutional

excellence that exists in other countries," he continued.  "Or we

risk, over time, losing our best and most capable people -- our

leaders of tomorrow."<p>

February 27, 1996<p>

<h2>Scotiabank reports strong first quarter results</h2>

<b>TORONTO  --</b>  Scotiabank continued its strong performance in the first quarter ended January 31, 1996, reporting net income of $249 million, an increase of $39 million or 18.5% from the same period a year ago. <p>



"All of the Bank's main businesses contributed to our first quarter success," said

Mr. Peter Godsoe, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  "We achieved market share gains across most domestic products, particularly in mortgage and consumer loans.  We continued to build on our success in small business lending, demonstrating Scotiabank's ongoing commitment to this important sector. <p>



"We also benefitted this quarter from sharply improved credit quality in our corporate and real estate portfolios, and an exceptionally strong performance by the newly launched Scotia Capital Markets,"  Mr. Godsoe said.<p>

    

Earnings per share rose to $0.95 in the first quarter, up from $0.82 in the same period a year ago.  Return on equity increased to 15.2% from 14.1%, and return on assets improved to 0.69%, up from 0.62%.<p>



Compared to the fourth quarter of 1995, net income for the first quarter increased by $19 million or 8.5%.  Earnings per share of $0.95 were up from $0.88, while return on equity of 15.2% was an improvement from 14.1%.  Return on assets increased to 0.69% from 0.65% in the preceding quarter.<p>



Net interest income for the first quarter was $867 million, up $71 million or 8.9% from the same period a year ago.  The increase was due in part to growth in business volumes, with mortgage lending increasing by $480 million and personal loans by $508 million over the previous quarter.  There were also higher gains from the sale of securities as the Bank took advantage of the buoyant equity and bond markets.<p>



Non-interest income for the quarter was $449 million, a substantial increase of $92 million or 25.6% over the same quarter a year ago.  There was a particularly strong improvement in underwriting fees and brokerage commissions earned by Scotia Capital Markets.<p>



Non-interest expenses for the first quarter were $804 million, an increase of $94 million or 13.2% year-over-year.  The increase was due mainly to the variable, performance-linked compensation associated with Scotia Capital Markets.<p>



Reflecting a continued emphasis on cost control, the Bank's productivity ratio -- non-interest expenses as a percentage of total revenues -- improved to 59.9% from 60.8% in the same quarter a year ago.  It remains one of the best such ratios among North American banks.<p>



Credit quality improved significantly in the quarter.  The Bank has estimated its annual provision for loan losses at $380 million in 1996, an improvement of $180 million, or 32.1% below the 1995 amount.  The loan loss charged to income in the first quarter was $95 million, a reduction of $8 million from the same quarter a year ago and $132 million below the immediately preceding quarter.<p>



Impaired (previously described as non-performing) loans outstanding also improved sharply, declining by $399 million from the immediately preceding quarter to

$1.0 billion at January 31, 1996.  These loans now represent 1.0% of total loans and acceptances, down from 1.4% at October 31, 1995.  The improvement was due to lower impaired real estate loans, the return of a major Canadian corporate account to performing status after a successful restructuring, and the additional allowance for credit losses from the implementation of the new impaired loans accounting standard.<p>

	

At January 31, 1996, there was a substantial surplus of $767 million in the market value of the Bank's securities portfolio (which includes developing country bonds), representing an improvement of $517 million over the previous quarter.  This reflects the positive impact of lower interest rates and improved confidence in the markets for developing country bonds.  In addition, the surplus of market over book value of the Bank's developing country loan portfolio rose to $189 million, a $15 million increase over the prior quarter.<p>



The Bank continues to maintain a general provision for doubtful credits of

$325 million, which is among the highest of the Canadian banks. <p>



Capital funds were $10.5 billion at January 31, 1996, a slight decrease of $107 million from the prior quarter.  The decrease was attributable to the redemption of a subordinated debenture of $213 million, and to the after-tax charge of $116 million to retained earnings relating to the adoption of the impaired loans accounting standard.<p>



At quarter end, the Bank's Tier 1 capital ratio was 6.69%, relatively unchanged from 6.67% at October 31, 1995.  The total capital ratio decreased to 9.42% at January 31, 1996 from 9.65% at year end, primarily due to the $213 million debenture redemption.  However, taking into account the $300 million, 15-year subordinated debenture issued on February 8, 1996, the total capital ratio has subsequently improved to 9.70%.<p>



Total assets were $145.8 billion at January 31, 1996, a decline of $1.4 billion from October 31, 1995.  The decrease was due to a reduction in liquidity which had been accumulated near the end of the previous quarter, partially offset by loan growth.<p>



A quarterly dividend of 31 cents per common share was approved by the Board of Directors at today's meeting, payable on April 26, 1996, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on April 2, 1996.<p>

<h2>Scotiabank reaches agreement to increase stake in Grupo Financiero Inverlat</h2>

<b>TORONTO  --</b>  Scotiabank announced today that it has reached an agreement with Mexico's financial authorities and with Inverlat's Board of Directors.  This agreement allows Scotiabank to purchase 55% of Grupo Financiero Inverlat S.A. de C.V. (the Group).  <p>



The agreement is expected to close within 90 days.  Upon closing, Scotiabank will invest US$50 million in Inverlat, in exchange for 16% of the equity in the Group.  The Bank will also purchase an eight-year bond for US$125 million, which may be converted to 39% of the Group's voting common stock on March 31, 2000.  The bond will earn interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 1% per annum.  Scotiabank will make a final payment to the Mexican government of up to US$50 million if Grupo Financiero Inverlat has a net worth greater than US$475 million by March 31, 2000.  Until that date, the Mexican government will own at least 51% of the Group, either directly or indirectly, and will ensure that Banco Inverlat, its commercial banking subsidiary, is able to satisfy all its regulatory capital requirements.<p>



"Scotiabank's investment in Grupo Financiero Inverlat is a testament to the ongoing co-operation between the Bank, the Mexican government and Inverlat's existing shareholders, and is a win-win-win situation for all," said Peter C. Godsoe, Scotiabank's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  "We look forward to continuing our work with the government and Inverlat's current management to further develop its share of the Mexican financial services market."<p>



Grupo Financiero Inverlat consists of five operating subsidiaries:  Banco Inverlat is the fourth-largest commercial bank in Mexico, with a network of 312 branches in Mexico City and all 31 Mexican states; Casa de Bolsa Inverlat is one of Mexico's leading investment banks, with offices in all the country's major cities; and, three smaller subsidiaries -- Arrendadora Inverlat, Factoring Inverlat and Casa de Cambio Inverlat -- are involved in leasing, factoring and foreign exchange, respectively.<p>



The agreement requires the division of the assets of Banco Inverlat, Arrendadora Inverlat and Factoring Inverlat, within 12 months of closing.  Non-performing assets of these three units will be placed in a liquidating trust, which will be a separate entity owned by the Mexican government but managed by Grupo Financiero Inverlat and its commercial banking subsidiary.  One of management's mandates will be to maximize the recoveries of the non-performing assets within the trust.<p>



As part of Scotiabank's management contract, the Bank will send a team of senior managers, led by its Executive Vice-President for Latin America, Mr. Sutton, to work with the Group's Chairman, Mr. Legorreta, its Vice-Chairman, Mr. Autrey, and its existing management team.  Scotiabank will play a key role in setting business priorities and will be responsible for running the Group's day-to-day operations.<p>





"We believe that the longer-term prospects for Mexico's economy are positive, particularly in light of the country's membership in NAFTA and the increased trade flows it has already created," said Mr. Godsoe.  "We also feel that the expertise of our management team, combined with that of Grupo Financiero Inverlat, will enable Inverlat to play a constructive role in the development of Mexico's economy."<p>



With C$147.2 billion in assets, Scotiabank is Canada's most international bank.  It operates 1,460 offices and branches in 46 countries on five continents.

<b>KINGSTON, Jamaica  --</b>  At Scotiabank Jamaica's Annual Meeting today, Mr. Cedric Ritchie announced that the Bank has donated J$100,000,000 to endow the Scotiabank Jamaica Foundation Ltd.  The Foundation will be dedicated to funding Jamaican charitable projects and social organizations. <p>

<h2>$200,000 donation to establish Scotiabank Distance Education Centre at University of New Brunswick</h2>

<b>SAINT JOHN  --</b>  Scotiabank announced today that it will donate $200,000 to the University of New Brunswick's Venture Campaign.  The donation, to be paid over five years, will establish the Scotiabank Distance Education Centre in the Multimedia Learning Centre on the Fredericton campus.<p>



"We are pleased to be able to make this donation, which will help further the University of New Brunswick's strong commitment to developing innovative learning options," said Barry Monroe, Scotiabank's Senior Vice-President, New Brunswick South and East.  "New Brunswick is one of Canada's leaders in developing state-of-the-art telecommunications technologies, and the University has emerged as a strong regional leader in the field of technology-assisted education."<p>



"Scotiabank's pledge of support will contribute to ensuring that the University of New Brunswick stays at the forefront of the development of distance learning," said Robin Armstrong, President of the University.  "UNB has achieved its leadership role in distance education through extensive investments in information technology infrastructure.  We are very pleased to enter into this important partnership with Scotiabank to further our expertise in this area."<p>



The University presently offers distance education in 92 credit and 14 non-credit courses by using a range of media, including:  interactive, on-line courses; CD-ROMs; and, audio and video conferencing.  Approximately 1,400 students in 25 locations throughout New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland and Bermuda took advantage of this unique learning opportunity.  During the current term, the University is offering three courses on the World Wide Web.<p>

 

The University of New Brunswick was founded in Fredericton in 1785.  Today, with a second campus in Saint John, the University has a total enrolment of more than 12,000 full- and part-time students.  <p>



With assets of $147.2 billion, Scotiabank is one of North America's largest financial institutions.  It opened its first office in New Brunswick, in Saint John, in 1874 and, today, its 55 branches make it the predominant bank in the province.

<h2>Strong and stable banking system is vital in uncertain times, Scotiabank Chairman says</h2>





<b>SAINT JOHN  --</b> In these times of political and economic uncertainty, Canada's banking system is an important source of national strength and stability, Scotiabank Chairman and CEO Peter C. Godsoe told shareholders today.<p>



In an address to the Bank's annual meeting in Saint John, Mr. Godsoe acknowledged that many Canadians are experiencing hardship because of a lack of economic growth and job layoffs. <p> 



"In these difficult times, Canadians are well served by our banking system," he said. "Canadian banks are safe, efficient, technologically advanced and deliver products seamlessly and at the same price from coast to coast."<p>



Mr. Godsoe challenged the popular perception that Canadian banks are too big, noting that, in fact, the industry is losing its competitive advantage to larger foreign institutions.<p>



"We're competing internationally against banks with capitalization and assets four, five, even ten times larger than ours, so we're hardly the global giants that some suggest," he said.  "In fact, in all probability, with the mergers going on south of the border and elsewhere, we're at risk of becoming too small to compete in tomorrow's global marketplace."<p>

	

Mr. Godsoe said he recognizes that much of the Canadian public sees banks as being too profitable.  While acknowledging that the banking industry enjoyed a good year in 1995, Mr. Godsoe observed that its returns were not excessive when compared to other industries and large multinational companies.  Nor were Canadian banks excessively profitable compared to their competitors in the U.S., the U.K., Germany and Australia.<p>



Mr. Godsoe also refuted the assertion that banks make their profits on the backs of Canadian consumers and subsidize various activities through their branch earnings.<p>



"In fact, Canadian banks -- especially Scotiabank -- compete and earn good profits in many different businesses and in many different markets right around the world," he said. "Last year, Scotiabank's domestic branches contributed slightly less than half of our net income.  The balance -- or more than half of our net income -- came from corporate, investment and international banking.<p>



"So our profits do not come only from Canadian consumers and small business," he pointed out.  "On the contrary, most of our profits are generated elsewhere.  And it is this range of businesses -- and our global reach -- that gives us the diversity, strength and stability to provide the level of service, technology and value that we offer our customers." <p>



Scotiabank's Chairman also reviewed the benefits that the Bank's earnings bring to Canadians:

<ul>

<li>the Bank employs more than 28,000 people in Canada, and created more than 400 new jobs in 1995 alone;

<li>Scotiabank paid more than $1.6 billion in salaries and benefits last year;

<li>the Bank donated more than $5 million in 1995 to about 1,500 groups in communities across Canada;

<li>Scotiabank paid dividends totalling $387 million to its 25,000 shareholders, 98 per cent of whom are Canadian.<p>

</ul>

Mr. Godsoe observed that contrary to popular belief, banks are one of the most heavily taxed sectors in Canada.<p>



"For example," he said, "Scotiabank paid $3.7 billion in taxes during the past five years, which is more than the $3.4 billion we made in profits."<p>



Mr. Godsoe said that the safety of the banking system, its Canadian ownership and its competitiveness collectively comprise "Canada's banking advantage."  He noted that while some believe that the government supports the safety of the system through the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation, "the fact is, CDIC is bank funded.  The major banks pay almost 80 per cent of total CDIC premiums.  The government pays zero.<p>



"Scotiabank survived and thrived without deposit insurance from 1832 until CDIC's creation in 1967 -- a period of 135 years," he said.  "Since then, Canada's banks have backstopped failures of other financial institutions, typically small, regional ones.  CDIC is a government entity we would love to privatize, thus allowing us to move to a self-insurance system, much like the German banks have for example."  <p>



Mr. Godsoe also said that in addition to being proudly Canadian, the banking system is also highly competitive.<p>



"We face enormous competition from coast-to-coast from literally hundreds of competitors, including banks, credit unions, caisses populaires, trust companies, foreign banks and mutual funds," he said.  "Moreover, when benchmarked against other banking systems internationally, we are extremely competitive.  For example, American banks, which are part of a system of thousands of competing banks, have higher service fees and higher interest spreads.  The same holds true of banks in the U.K. and Germany.<p>



"We welcome competition and are not looking to be protected," Mr. Godsoe continued.  "Competition is great and, in the end, is the consumer's best guarantee of top quality service, freedom of choice and low prices." <p>

<h2>Superior productivity and strong domestic performance led to solid gains for shareholders, Scotiabank Vice-Chairman says</h2>


<b>SAINT JOHN  --</b> The best productivity ratio in Canadian banking and a strong domestic performance led to solid gains for shareholders in 1995, Scotiabank Vice-Chairman Robert Chisholm said today. <p>



"Scotiabank's annual return to shareholders -- consisting of dividends and share price appreciation -- has been very strong relative to the TSE Bank Index and the TSE 300," Mr. Chisholm told the Bank's annual meeting in Saint John.  "Total returns were 10.2 per cent in 1995 and have averaged 27.6 per cent per year over the past five years.  We look on this record of rewarding our shareholders with a great deal of pride."<p>



Mr. Chisholm reported that the Bank's net income of $876 million in 1995 marked the sixth consecutive year of record earnings, excluding the effect of special one-time charges in 1994.<p>



"We also achieved the best productivity ratio in Canadian banking, beating the competition for the fifth straight year," he said.  "At 59.9%, our ratio of expenses to revenue also ranks quite favourably by world banking standards."<p>



Mr. Chisholm noted that the Bank's domestic operations achieved strong returns, building market share and developing stronger relationships with both personal and commercial customers.<p>



"Overall," he said, "fiscal 1995 was a year of strong loan growth for the Bank.  Total average loans were up more than 15 per cent year-over-year, and there were increases in all of the main elements of our portfolio -- business loans, mortgages and personal loans."<p>



Mr. Chisholm pointed out that strong asset growth contributed to an increase in net interest income, which rose to $3.1 billion in 1995.  Excluding the $145 million write down of the Bank's investment in Grupo Financiero Inverlat in the fourth quarter, net interest income would have been up five per cent from 1994.<p>



"This growth was broadly based," observed Mr. Chisholm, "showing the value of our diversification and the strength and stability of our core interest margins."<p>



Mr. Chisholm reported that the Bank also achieved strong growth in non-interest revenue, largely due to new products and services as well as higher volumes.<p>

 

While Scotiabank's return on assets of 0.64 per cent was basically flat year-over-year, Mr. Chisholm said this is expected to improve as Montreal Trust becomes more fully integrated with the Bank. <p>



"There are particularly strong synergies for new business in the personal trust area and in corporate services," he observed.  "The integration program is on schedule and will be completed in 1996, and our integration expenses are running below budget."<p>



The Bank's specific provisions for credit losses dropped to $560 million in 1995, representing 0.57 per cent of average loans and acceptances, down from $592 million or 0.70 per cent in 1994.  Mr. Chisholm said that the Bank expects further and significant improvement in this area in 1996, due to improving economic conditions combined with steps taken recently to deal with a number of accounts.<p>



He added that the Bank's general provision of $325 million is the highest reserve of its kind among the Canadian banks.  In addition, the Bank has a surplus of market-over-book value in its securities and developing country (LDC) portfolios totalling $422 million.<p>

  

Mr. Chisholm reported that earnings per share increased 23 cents in 1995 to a record $3.38, (excluding the effect of special one-time charges in 1994), while dividends were increased to an annual rate of $1.24 per common share from $1.16.<p>



"Our strong capital position combined with our consistent earnings growth has enabled us to increase dividends in 23 of the past 25 years," Mr. Chisholm said.  "Our dividends are about ten times what they were in 1970."<p>



"The Bank enjoyed a very successful year in 1995," Mr. Chisholm concluded.  "In terms of shareholder value, Scotiabank has delivered." <p>

<h2>Core strengths lay the foundation for record results, Scotiabank President says</h2>





<b>SAINT JOHN  -- </b>Scotiabank's core strengths were fundamental to the success of the Bank's main businesses in 1995, Scotiabank President Bruce Birmingham told shareholders today.<p>



"Productivity, risk management, diversification and customer satisfaction -- each of these areas is a critical element in our long-term success," Mr. Birmingham said at the Bank's annual meeting in Saint John.  "And in each of these areas, Scotiabank has a distinct comparative long-term advantage."<p>



In his speech, Mr. Birmingham reviewed 1995 initiatives and performance highlights within each of the Bank's four business lines:  Domestic, Corporate, Investment and International Banking. <p>



Mr. Birmingham reported that Domestic Banking had a particularly successful year, contributing almost half of Scotiabank's net income in 1995.  The Bank achieved strong market share gains in both personal loans and mortgages, and enjoyed similar success on the deposit side.  Scotiabank also increased the number of its small business borrowing customers by 27 per cent, achieving particularly strong growth in loans under $200,000.  <p>



"This performance was as a result of a consistent, customer-focused approach to building this business," Mr. Birmingham said, "and a deep commitment to the small- and medium-sized business market in Canada."<p>



Mr. Birmingham reported that the Bank's Corporate Banking division achieved good growth, largely due to its global capabilities.  Highlights of the year included providing a $1 billion globally syndicated line of credit to Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan to support its acquisition of Texas Gulf Inc.<p>



Mr. Birmingham noted that despite the tough year in global securities markets and challenging economic conditions, Scotiabank's Investment Banking division also made a positive contribution to the Bank's net income in 1995.  Most significantly, 1995 marked the completion of the integration of ScotiaMcLeod and the Bank's Investment Banking group.  On November 1, the Bank launched two new units:  a combined sales and trading division operating under the banner of Scotia Capital Markets, and a global treasury group.<p>



"This new structure has moved us one step closer to establishing our integrated, global investment banking capability," said Mr. Birmingham.  "And it positions us to compete more aggressively and effectively with global investment banks."<p>



Mr. Birmingham indicated that the International Banking division made a solid contribution, due to a strong performance by the Bank's Caribbean network and continuing market development work in fast-expanding Asian markets.  As Canada's most internationally diverse bank, Scotiabank expanded its network of branches in Asia, adding one in New Delhi, India and one in Guangzhou, China.  It also acquired an 80 per cent stake in Corporacion Mercaban of Costa Rica and finalized its 25 per cent interest in Banco Quilmes of Argentina.<p>



Mr. Birmingham also acknowledged the Bank's Operations Group for its role in allowing the Bank to effectively manage its costs.<p>



"We process more than three million transactions daily," Mr. Birmingham noted.  "Even with ever-mounting volumes in ABMs and at the point-of-sale, our Operations team continues to successfully improve its service.  From reducing the tons of paper we generate, to developing more customer-focused systems -- doing business more efficiently is one of the Operations Group's main goals," said Mr. Birmingham.<p>



Mr. Birmingham concluded his speech by highlighting the quality of Scotiabank's employees and praising them for their dedication.<p>



"Our employees are deeply committed to customer satisfaction and to winning," Mr. Birmingham said.  "Equally, the Bank is committed to our employees -- committed to being a good, secure place to work, respectful of differences, and continuously building the strength and diversity of our workforce."<p>

<h2>Scotiabank to open third branch in India</h2>





<b>TORONTO  -- </b>Scotiabank announced today that The Reserve Bank of India has granted approval in principle for the Bank to open a branch in Coimbatore, an industrial city of about 3 1/2 million people in southern India.  The new branch, which is expected to open in the second half of this year, will bring to three the number of Scotiabank branches in this Asian country.<p>



"Coimbatore is one of the principal centres of India's cotton yarn and textiles industry, and has considerable importance as a manufacturing base and processing centre for coffee and vegetable oils," said Calum Johnston, Executive Vice-President, International Banking.  "The new Scotiabank branch will provide a full range of retail and commercial financial services to local and international customers.  It will also be an excellent complement to our two existing branches in India, in New Delhi and Bombay.<p>



"India is one of the key Asian economies and, with a population of more than 900 million people, is destined to play a major role in the world economy," said Mr. Johnston.  "We expect economic growth to continue at about six per cent in 1996, and average five per cent or more for the balance of the decade."<p>



Scotiabank is Canada's fourth-largest chartered bank, with assets of $147.2 billion.  It is also Canada's most international bank, operating 1,460 branches and offices in 46 countries around the world, including 11 in Asia.  Scotiabank was the first Canadian bank to establish a presence in India, opening a branch in Bombay in 1984.  The Bank opened a second branch -- in New Delhi -- in Nov. 1994.<p>

<h2>Scotiabank to open representative office in Vietnam</h2>

<b>TORONTO  --</b>  Scotiabank announced today that it has received approval from the State Bank of Vietnam to open a representative office in Hanoi.  The initiative makes Scotiabank the first Canadian bank to establish a presence in Vietnam.<p>



"The Hanoi representative office will provide Scotiabank with an excellent foothold in one of the most dynamic emerging economies in Southeast Asia," said Calum Johnston, Scotiabank's Executive Vice-President, International Banking.  "The Bank is now even better positioned to service the needs of our existing and potential customers who already operate in the region, and to play a role in the continuing growth and development of Vietnam."<p>



A member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Vietnam is one of Asia's fastest-growing economies.  Gross Domestic Product growth has been close to nine per cent in recent years, and the economy is expected to continue growing in the eight to 10 per cent range in 1996.  <p>



Scotiabank is Canada's fourth largest chartered bank, with assets totalling C$147.2 billion.  It is also Canada's most international bank, operating through 1,460 offices and branches in more than 40 countries on five continents.  The Hanoi office, which will open in the next two months, brings Scotiabank's Asian presence to 11 countries, the highest representation of any Canadian bank.<p>

The Canadian economy has been lagging far behind the United States. During the first half of 1996, annualized growth averaged just 1 1/4 per cent, less than half the U.S. pace. At a time when strong job creation has pulled the American unemployment rate to a seven-year low of just over 5 per cent, Canada's jobless rate remains over 4 percentage points higher. Similarly, U.S. personal disposable income is up about 5 per cent over the past year, more than double the pace on this side of the border. <p>

But after bumping along the runway for most of the 1990s, there are signs that the Canadian economy may soon gain enough velocity to achieve lift-off. Exports continue to set new records and are poised for further gains in 1997. Over half of Canadian manufactured output is exported - largely south of the border - so buoyant U.S. activity is giving a big boost to shipments and order books. The resource sector also will benefit over the next year from the Japanese and European economic revivals. <p>

Businesses will be gearing up to meet improved market conditions now that inventory liquidation, which was a big drag on production during the second quarter, is largely over. Employment is trending higher, with roughly two-thirds of the net increase occurring in the manufacturing sector. Investment plans also are being revised up, more than offsetting public sector cuts to infrastructure spending. <p>

Consumers remain cautious, but confidence should improve as stronger job creation allows disposable income gains to more than match inflation. The dramatic decline in borrowing costs over the past year has significantly boosted the discretionary income of households rolling over debt and should provide substantial support to big-ticket sales. Residential construction is already growing at double-digit rates, largely in response to a turnaround in the depressed Ontario market. <p>

These factors should boost national output by about 3 per cent in 1997, nearly double this year's growth performance. By then, Canada will be outpacing the United States, which is on track for a gain of roughly 2 1/2 per cent in both years.<p>

<img align=left src="glob1.gif">

The pace of economic activity south of the border should remain fairly steady, with consumer spending supported by solid income gains. While investment and housing activity are expected to cool in 1997, exports will benefit from the recovery in overseas markets.<p>

Inflation has probably reached its low on both sides of the border and will have an upward bias in 1997. Nevertheless, Canada's inflation rate is unlikely to break above 2 per cent, still more than a percentage point below the U.S. trend. <p><br clear=all>

<B>Low interest rates will underpin economic growth<p></B>

The Bank of Canada has successfully pursued a <I>made-in-Canada</I> policy, lowering interest rates nine times this year even though American monetary policy has been on hold since January. By mid-October, Canadian yields were less than comparable U.S. levels for terms to ten years. Despite the sharp drop in interest rates, the dollar has moved above 74 cents(US), a clear indication of strengthening investor confidence in Canada.
<p>
The better financial market tone reflects fundamental improvements in Canada's external trade and fiscal performances. The current account moved into surplus in the second quarter of 1996 and further improvement will result in an annual surplus in 1997 following fourteen years of successive deficits. Record trade surpluses, a sharply lower tourist deficit and reduced foreign debt service costs have eliminated the need for Canada to borrow abroad to finance domestic activity. <p>

Government deficits have also fallen dramatically, from a combined federal/provincial peak above $65 billion in 1993 to just over $30 billion this year. Another big reduction is likely in 1997 as the remaining big overspenders - Ottawa, Ontario and Quebec - move aggressively to eliminate their shortfalls. <p>

The ability to sustain a home-grown monetary policy will be tested in the months ahead as U.S. interest rates begin to rise. With solid economic momentum and the best of the low inflation news largely over, the U.S. Federal Reserve will likely push short-term interest rates gradually higher over the winter. While Canadian rates may lag, it will be difficult to buck this trend given the negative-to-narrow configuration of current spreads off New York. A rekindling of Quebec political uncertainties could also corral the Bank of Canada's new-found maneuvering room.<p>

We expect U.S. money market rates to move up about three-quarters of a percentage point over the next year, but bond yields - which have already adjusted upwards - will likely show a more modest rise. Canadian rates are expected to follow suit eventually, though the current very wide negative spreads at the short end of the yield curve should remain largely intact. The Canadian dollar will likely rise to the 75-77 cent(US) range, bolstered by positive economic fundamentals but constrained by decreased premiums on Canadian fixed-term investments relative to their U.S. counterparts.<p>

<B><Font Size=+1>Low Interest Rates Underpin G7 Recovery</Font><p></B>

G7 growth should edge slightly higher in 1997 as the European economic recovery gradually gathers steam. Accommodative monetary policies will provide an important offset to broadly based fiscal tightening. Low interest rates will support moderate gains in consumer spending and help governments reduce deficits by containing debt service costs. Inflation remains largely dormant - there is ample industrial capacity and wage pressures are minimal.<p>

Output in the four major European economies should increase by about 2 per cent in 1997, roughly double this year's outcome. The U.K. remains the growth leader, with the government expected to maintain low interest rates in the run-up to the election, which must be called by April. German industrial activity has begun to pick up alongside moderate advances in consumer spending and exports. However, France and Italy will lag as spending is squeezed by further fiscal retrenchment. <p>
Japanese growth should exceed 3 per cent this year - the strongest performance since 1991. Record-low borrowing costs and repeated fiscal infusions have sparked the revival. However, next April's planned increase in the national sales tax and a more cautious fiscal stance should slow next year's advance despite the pick-up in exports flowing from the depreciation of the yen. <p>

<B>Strong demand from emerging economies</B><p>

China will continue to be the international growth leader, with output projected to increase by more than 8 per cent through 1997. The expansion is being fuelled by massive infrastructure projects, large-scale foreign investment and a nation-wide property boom. Hong Kong should grow by roughly 4 per cent - underpinned by construction activity and gains in services - despite uncertainties associated with the territory reverting to China next July. High-technology investments and a relatively stable exchange rate will also keep Taiwan in its recent 5-6 per cent growth range. <p>

Growth in India should be about 6 per cent through 1997, in line with the trend of the past decade. Foreign investment has picked up and domestic firms have made big inroads into higher value-added areas such as software development.<p>

Large trade deficits in Korea, Malaysia and Thailand have set the stage for slower growth. The authorities are aiming to curb consumer spending and put a damper on property speculation and the construction boom. Output in Korea and Malaysia is expected to increase by 6-8 per cent into 1997. However, the Thai export engine has run out of steam, and growth may slip to about 4 per cent next year - the weakest performance in more than two decades.<p>

A broadening web of hemispheric commercial agreements - dominated by NAFTA in the north and Mercosur (Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and recently Chile) in the south - is having a positive impact on trade and growth in Latin America. Mexican activity has been buoyed by increased exports to the United States - the destination for 85 per cent of local exports. Business investment and consumer spending are reviving, sparked by significant declines in borrowing costs and by big gains in domestic equity prices. <p>

Brazilian firms are still struggling with the adverse impact on exports of the huge appreciation of the real since mid-1994. The authorities have pushed tariff rates back up to as much as 70 per cent in some key industries like the automotive sector to provide temporary relief. However, this policy prescription raises the risk of a continuing dependence on protectionist practices and of retaliatory measures by Brazil's overseas trading partners.<p>
Argentina is emerging from a severe recession and growth is expected to move up to the 3 per cent range by 1997. Slower exports to Brazil will be more than offset by a pick-up in domestic consumer spending and business investment. <p>

Chilean prospects are encouraging despite this year's steep decline in the prices of two key exports, copper and pulp. Investment in the natural resources sector remains strong. Sizeable wage increases triggered by tight labour markets and big productivity gains will bolster consumer spending.<p>

<B><Font Size=+2>Canada's External Trade</Font><p>
</B>
<B><Font Size=+1>Foreign Debt Poised To Decline</Font><p></B>

 
International trade has been the backbone of Canada's economy, with inflation-adjusted exports rising $2 for every $1 advance in national output since the decade began. Foreign sales now account for 37 per cent of GDP, compared with 25 per cent in 1990, making Canada the most trade-intensive economy of the G7. The United States (11 per cent) and Japan (10 per cent) are the G7 members least dependent on foreign markets.<p>

Canada is on track for a record $37 billion merchandise trade surplus in 1996, ten times the level just five years ago. Further export growth, reinforced by this country's improved international competitiveness, higher commodity prices and broadening recoveries overseas should push the surplus to $40 billion next year. <p>

Gains have been widespread. The transportation sector is benefitting from record motor vehicle assemblies - 90 per cent are destined south of the border - and increased sales of airplanes and locomotives. Exports of telecommunications equipment and software are outpacing the growth in total shipments by a wide margin. <p>

In the resource sector, lumber receipts have strengthened alongside renewed U.S. home building and higher prices. A pick-up in export prices is boosting natural gas receipts, while the expansion of oil pipeline capacity will fuel energy shipments over the next few years. Agriculture also is enjoying high grain prices and increased shipments of processed foods. <p>

Lower debt service payments and increased tourism are helping to reduce the chronic shortfall on non-merchandise transactions. As a result, the overall current account balance is poised to register its first annual surplus after fourteen years of successive deficits. <p>

Canada is at a watershed. Recent structural changes in our economy create the potential for multi-year surpluses in our current account balance. This would allow a sustained reduction in net external debt - now around $335 billion - for the first time in nearly half a century. <p>

Canadians have been reluctant shoppers during the 1990s, and this year is no exception. Government belt-tightening and an uneven pace of job creation have kept the squeeze on spending power. High debt burdens and low savings rates have added to household caution. At mid-year, retail sales volumes were still below a year earlier.<p>

However, Canadians should be in more of a buying mood in the months ahead. The private sector has created over 150 thousand jobs so far this year, offsetting cuts in the public sector by a factor of more than three to one. Gathering employment momentum will boost real per capita disposable income by almost one per cent in 1997, the first significant increase in eight years. <p>

While savers are pinched by falling interest rates, borrowers - who tend to be bigger spenders - receive a bonus. The rollover of household debt at reduced financing rates stands to raise discretionary income by over $4 billion in 1996. For taxpayers, rate reductions and credits in Ontario and B.C. this year - and in Ontario, B.C., Nova Scotia and Alberta next year - are also an important plus. The slated GST harmonization in most of Atlantic Canada in 1997 will provide additional relief. <p>

Improving affordability has triggered a rebound in home sales, which are running 22 per cent above last year's depressed levels. Construction is beginning to respond - particularly in Ontario, which hit a 43-year low in starts in 1995. Spending on renovation is also on the rise. <p>

Business investment intentions have been revised higher alongside tightening capacity utilization and increased resource exploration/development. Spending on productivity-enhancing machinery & equipment is still underpinning growth, though sagging profits have recently cut into outlays.<p>

Price pressures should remain modest, notwithstanding increased food and energy costs. High unemployment and government retrenchment will exert a powerful dampening influence on wages and benefits. Strength-ening productivity gains also will help to constrain unit labour costs. By 1997, consumer inflation will have been below the U.S. trend for an unprecedented six years.<p>

<B><Font Size=+2>Fiscal Performance</Font><p></B>
<B><Font Size=+1>Shrinking Government Borrowing</Font><p></B>


Canada is making rapid headway in trimming government borrowing. Combined federal/provincial deficits are expected to drop below $25 billion in FY1997/98, down from the high-water mark of $65 billion in FY1992/93. This will represent just under 3 per cent of GDP. Among the G7, only the U.S. is expected to have as good a fiscal performance in 1997. The ratio of government debt to GDP will peak at just over 110 per cent during the next year. <p>

In Canada, government belt-tightening is still relying on big cuts in federal/provincial program and capital spending, estimated at 4 per cent in FY1996/97 and over 2 per cent the following year. Provincial transfers are being slashed by $6 billion over this period, forcing these jurisdictions into a major overhaul of health, education and social services. Tax relief measures introduced or planned in Ontario, B.C., Alberta and the Atlantic provinces will only partially offset the impact of expenditure cutbacks.<p>

Cautious government fiscal forecasts will allow most jurisdictions to improve their finances more than officially projected. Stronger-than-expected growth will boost revenues and trim social support costs. Lower-than-expected interest rates also will contain combined federal/provincial debt service costs, which last year reached over $65 billion.<p>

The federal government is likely to better its FY1996/97 deficit target of $24.3 billion by a substantial margin, mirroring events that last year produced a much better-than-expected shortfall of $28.6 billion. By FY1998/99, fiscal retrenchment should pull the deficit well below the $9 billion target. With roughly this much generated by internal sources - such as public sector pension surpluses and privatization proceeds - the federal government can then begin to pay down market borrowing.<p>

Ontario and Quebec have implemented major expenditure reduction programmes, but have a long way to go to eliminate their FY1996/97 deficits of $8 billion and $3 billion respectively. In contrast, the other provinces are shifting their focus to paying down debt.<p>

<B><Font Size=+2>Financial Markets</Font><p></B>
<B><Font Size=+1>A Made-In-Canada Monetary Policy</Font><p></B>


With inflation at the low end of its 1-3 per cent target range, the Bank of Canada has been aggressively easing monetary conditions to kick-start the economy. Nine cuts since the beginning of the year, eight of them independently of the U.S. Federal Reserve, have pulled money market rates down by more than 2 1/3 percentage points. This <I>made-in-Canada</I> monetary policy has been reinforced by a growing recognition of our improved inflation, fiscal and external trade performances.<p>

With U.S. short-term rates virtually unchanged during this period, domestic yields have fallen almost 2
percentage points below levels south of the border - a negative spread not seen in over a decade. The premium on long-term Government of Canada bonds has been sliced by more than four-fifths, to less than 30 basis points, as domestic bond yields have been insulated from the run-up in U.S. rates. The dollar also has risen above 74 cents(US). <p>

However, the financial market rally in October has pulled North American rates close to their cycle lows. The U.S. economy retains solid momentum, with robust income gains keeping consumers relatively upbeat. Large employment increases have cut the jobless rate to 5.2 per cent. Even though inflation remains around 3 per cent, the Federal Reserve is expected to begin tightening over the winter to pre-empt a build-up in wage and price pressures.<p>

With the Canadian economy gathering steam, there  is little reason for our monetary conditions to become even more stimulative. It also will be difficult for domestic rates to buck a rising U.S. trend given the current narrow-to-negative configuration of spreads off New York. Nevertheless, the Bank of Canada may opt to lag the rise in rates south of the border to ensure that the economy finally achieves a sustained lift-off.<p>

We expect U.S. short-term rates to rise by nearly a percentage point during 1997, with bond yields having a moderate upward bias. While Canadian rates may lag, the current very wide negative spreads at the short end of the yield curve are expected to narrow slightly by year end. The Canadian dollar should move into the 75-77 cent(US) range, bolstered by strong economic fundamentals.<p>

Overseas interest rates also have moved against the U.S. tide as listless economies and subdued inflation have kept most central banks in easing mode. German and French long-term bond yields have fallen 50 basis points below U.S. rates - a reduction in spreads off New York of a full percentage point since the beginning of the year in the case of Germany and 1H percentage points for France. Italy has reaped additional gains from falling inflation, with long-term yields down 2 percentage points. Japanese bond yields have moved back below 3 per cent.<p>

With the shift in the European and Japanese economies into higher gear, overseas yields should edge up next year, though the rise will be modest because inflation remains subdued. The degree of monetary tightening also will be tempered by the economic drag from fiscal retrenchment on the Continent and by the move to a less accommodative budgetary stance in Japan.<p>

The U.S. dollar will benefit from higher American interest rates and a declining trade deficit. Intervention by the Bank of Japan is reinforcing the dollar's rise against the yen, though Japan's pre-eminent net creditor status points to long-term strength in the yen. Current account shortfalls are slowly eroding Germany's net credit position, undercutting the Deutschemark versus the U.S. dollar. The French franc will continue to fluctuate closely with the mark. Sterling is expected to appreciate moderately versus the D-mark, but lose some ground to the U.S. dollar.<p>

<B><Font Size=+1>Manufacturing Climbs Value-Added Ladder</Font><p></B>


Canadian manufacturing exports will benefit from a slight pick-up in the G7 economies in 1996/97, after a global inventory correction in many industries in late 1995. A growing emphasis on high value-added products in the forestry and oil & gas related sectors - petrochemicals and fertilizers - is adding increasing depth to manufacturing. Canada's telecommunications equipment and aircraft frame & parts industries - centred in Ontario and Quebec - will also benefit from strong export demand, leading-edge technology and a competitive currency. <p>

Ethylene-based petrochemical prices have rebounded strongly with a resumption of polyethylene buying by China and an end to last year's global inventory correction. Alberta output will expand rapidly through the end of the decade, as producers invest $2 billion in new capacity. Construction of the largest project - a $600 million ethylene plant - will start next fall. Low-cost ethane feedstocks provide Western Canada with a competitive edge over the U.S. South. <p>

Auto industry employment and production have been at a record this year and will be boosted further in 1997-98 with the expansion of two Japanese-owned assembly plants in Ontario. While a strike has temporarily dampened output, production should climb to a new record in 1997. Rising transplant capacity will more than offset flat North American vehicle sales, providing important spin-offs for steel, plastics and industrial textiles. <p>

Canadian companies will export nearly $8 billion of telecommunications equipment in 1996, contributing over $2.4 billion to the trade surplus. Telecommunications deregulation in the United States will trigger a scramble to create a digital superhighway, converging the services of local and long-distance telcos, cable operators and wireless companies. However, court challenges by the Regional Bells will slow the pace of deregulation. The rising consumer popularity of direct-to-home satellite broadcasting and wireless communications will spur demand for routing & switching equipment, signal compression technology and fibre-optic cable. The licencing of new cable channels and PCS services in Canada will also buoy domestic orders for telecom hardware and software. <p>

<B>Pulp markets recover</B><p>

Global pulp market conditions are firming again, after a sharp inventory adjustment. NBSK pulp prices in the United States have edged up from a low of US$520 in the spring to US$600 in October and will probably move to US$700 in 1997. Orders for business communications paper have picked up in the United States and Europe and demand for coated and uncoated groundwood papers should benefit from stronger seasonal advertising in the fourth quarter - boosting pulp demand. After substantial mill downtime in early 1996, Canadian producers have quickly ramped up their output. However, careful inventory management will be needed to keep prices moving ahead in view of the modest pace of global demand growth. <p>

In contrast, newsprint prices remain soft in North American markets. Prices have been under downward pressure because of last year's buildup of stocks at publishers and weak advertising lineage in newspapers. Prices should stabilize as coverage of the Presidential election and holiday promotions boost consumption and publisher stocks continue to recede. However, Canadian mill operating rates are likely to stay low. <p>

North American lumber prices have strengthened dramatically this year alongside robust U.S. single-family construction and concern over potential supply constraints from four provinces linked to the U.S./ Canada softwood lumber agreement. Prices will stay relatively high in 1997, but are likely to ease as mortgage rate increases eventually dampen U.S. housing starts. Lumber and OSB producers will emphasizefurther offshore market development. <p>

Most base metal markets will firm moderately over the coming year, with the exception of copper. Global nickel consumption has probably edged down in 1996 as stainless steel producers in Europe, South Africa and the Far East cut output after an inventory build in 1995. However, world nickel consumption remains higher than production and supply conditions will tighten again in 1997. Global demand for stainless and high alloy steels will be boosted next year by strong aircraft orders and substantial petrochemical capacity expansion. <p>

Western Canada's oil service sector has enjoyed a near-record level of exploration & development activity this year- underpinned by profitable crude oil prices averaging about US$21 per barrel. Despite weak domestic natural gas prices, overall drilling activity will probably stay at a high level next year. Oil prices will remain above US$20 in the absence of Iraqi sales and oil sands development in Alberta and Saskatchewan will support drilling. Oil exports will surge as the Hibernia project comes on stream and the new Express Pipeline, linking Alberta to refineries in the U.S. Midwest and mountain states, starts up in early 1997. <p>

<B><Font Size=+1>Ontario Challenges Alberta For Top Spot</Font><p></B>


While Alberta is forecast to lead provincial growth in 1996 and 1997, Ontario is expected to accelerate into a strong second position over the next year. Five other provinces are also likely to expand by over 2 per cent in 1997. Private sector growth is more than offsetting fiscal drag, which in many provinces is beginning to diminish because of earlier fiscal prudence. <p>

In Newfoundland, the promise of Voisey's Bay and further development related to offshore oil brighten the outlook for the late 1990s; but output will be dampened as construction of the Hibernia offshore oil project is completed. Prince Edward Island will also lose economic momentum with the completion of the Confederation Bridge to the mainland. New activity, in the areas of airplane refurbishing and call centres, will supplement P.E.I.'s mainstays - the potato industry, the shellfishery and tourism. <p>

Nova Scotia will benefit from an upswing in business investment, including the province's first toll highway and a supercalendered paper mill geared to the U.S. market. Atlantic consumers (except P.E.I.) will receive a major reduction in provincial retail sales taxes resulting from the slated harmonization with the federal Goods and Services Tax (GST) in 1997. Nova Scotia residents will also enjoy a 3.4 per cent cut in the provincial personal income tax rate next July. 
New Brunswick will lead growth in the Atlantic region next year, with expansion in the telecommunications and software industries supplementing gains in traditional industries. The latter are expected to strengthen with firmer pulp & paper prices and major upgrades in the forest products sector. Production of lead, zinc, antimony and indium will resume at several sites. <p>

Exports will remain a bright spot for Quebec through 1997. Aluminium prices should recover moderately after slow international demand this year. Orders for groundwood specialty papers also are expected to firm in the U.S. market.  Strong orders for commuter aircraft, flight simulators and railway vehicles will compensate for little growth in the motor vehicle sector. However, consumption growth will continue to be constrained below the national average by fiscal belt-tightening, weak job creation and lingering political uncertainty.<p>

Ontario's private sector growth is accelerating, led by the motor vehicle and high-tech sectors. The automotive industry's concentration on vans and sport utility vehicles is proving very advantageous with current North American sales trends. The first of several Japanese transplant capacity additions is scheduled to begin production in mid-1997, bolstering demand for parts. <p>

Ontario consumers are expected to move off the sidelines in reaction to stronger job growth, lower personal taxes and a favorable interest rate environment. Housing demand has already responded to the attractive combination of lower housing prices and low mortgage rates. <p>

The robust outlook for the three Prairie provinces is being underpinned by increased economic diversification, strong international demand for grains and balanced provincial budgets. Farm incomes and investment are being lifted by higher receipts and capital assistance payments following the elimination of the Crow Rate subsidy. Food processing activities are expanding.<p>

Manitoba's diversified economy will be firing on several other fronts in addition to agriculture. Mining production will be boosted by the opening of two new gold mines and increased global demand for nickel. Mining is also reinforcing the good news for agriculture in Saskatchewan. The province is benefitting from higher-than-anticipated world oil prices, which is encouraging exploration and production, and strong markets for fertilizers and uranium. <p>

Alberta's leading position in provincial growth this year and next reflects expansion across all its major industries. Strength in world oil prices is spurring pipeline and oil sands investments. Anchored by relatively low cost material inputs, Alberta's petrochemical industry is undertaking major expansion, including plans for the largest ethylene plant in North America. The service sector also is broadening and deepening its base. Calgary is increasing its stature as a service centre and rail transportation hub for the region.<p>

B.C.'s growth this year has been pulled back by softening commodity prices and lower resource-based exports. Firming global markets next year will support a gradual pick-up in the pulp & paper industry. However, the province's expansion will remain primarily driven by strong population inflows and the service sector.  <p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Canadian economic growth is poised to accelerate to just over 3 per cent next year. While exports will lead the advance, consumer spending is set to revive. A combination of confidence building factors - stronger job creation, higher incomes and dramatically lower interest rates - will finally pull Canadians off the sidelines.<p>

<li>Consumer spending - which accounts for 60 per cent of economic activity - will rise at an average annual rate of over 2 per cent this year and next, double the pace during the first half of the 1990s. This improvement will be underpinned by the first national increase in real personal disposable income per capita this decade.<p>

<li>Alberta will top the growth charts in both personal income and consumption. Ontario is expected to post the most pronounced spending turnaround, after lagging the national trend so far this decade. Improved farm cash inflows and economic diversification will support consumer purchases in Manitoba and Saskatchewan. In Quebec and Atlantic Canada, growth in household spending should roughly double, but will still remain below the national pace.<p>

<li>After outstripping the national performance from 1986 to 1994, B.C. consumer spending has come in line with national trends. This pattern will continue through 1997.<p>

<li>The housing recovery will build momentum over the next year, supporting big-ticket purchases and renovation activity. Motor vehicle spending is also expected to edge higher.<p>

<B>A mixed performance</B><br>
Economic growth in the Atlantic region is expected to pick up through 1997, alongside continuing diversification in New Brunswick and a strengthening Nova Scotia economy. Nevertheless, expansion on the East Coast will be constrained below the national pace. The completion of the Confederation Bridge will result in a pause in growth in P.E.I. The extended groundfishery closure and winding down of Hibernia construction also will dampen Newfoundland's near-term growth prospects (see individual provincial forecasts on p. 8). As Atlantic Canada shifts from public sector dependence to private sector initiatives, the promise of Voisey's Bay, Sable Island, further offshore oil & gas development and expanding telecommunications activity brightens the outlook beyond 1997.<p>

<B>Consumer spending edging higher</B><br>
The Atlantic region should post back-to-back annual increases in consumer spending of roughly 1H per cent, the strongest performance since 1990. Spending gains in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and P.E.I. will continue to compensate for the consumer caution anticipated in Newfoundland. <p>

<B>Job creation kicks in</B><br>
Employment growth is forecast to strengthen to 1.4 per cent in 1997, inching the unemployment rate lower to 13.4 per cent. The East Coast will be particularly affected by federal Employment Insurance reforms. Official estimates indicate benefit cuts of over 10 per cent for FY97/98, draining about $200 million from personal incomes. <p>

<B>Tax assistance</B><br>
Incomes in Nova Scotia will be boosted by the 3.4 per cent cut in provincial personal income taxes scheduled for July 1997. The slated harmonization with the federal GST next April will substantially reduce provincial retail sales taxes for consumers in Newfoundland, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. In New Brunswick, for example, annual savings from the GST harmonization are expected to total about $250 for the average family. <p>

<B>Big-ticket support</B><br>
Considerable pent-up demand exists for big-ticket items. From 1989 to 1995, spending related to motor vehicles fell by almost 11 per cent in volume terms, while furniture and household appliance purchases dropped 6 per cent. Home computer sales in New Brunswick are being supported by a sales tax rebate of up to $250 for purchases made before year-end.<P>

<B>Supported by tourism</B><br> 
A competitive Canadian dollar and the region's focus on tourism are expected to produce additional pay-offs in increased spending. The Atlantic region has posted a 40 per cent gain in non-resident tourist receipts from 1990 to 1995, boosted by heightened interest from overseas visitors who now account for over one-quarter of non-resident spending.<p>
<center>
<img align=top src="prov3.gif"><p>
</center>

<B>Home ownership less onerous</B><br>
While home ownership is high on the East Coast, less than one-half of home owners have a mortgage. The amount outstanding also is significantly below the national average, reflecting the region's moderate house prices. With more modest debt burdens, consumer bankruptcies relative to employment are much lower than in most other regions. <p>

<p>

<B>Continued consumer caution</B><br>
The pace of economic activity is expected to pick up next year, but it will still remain well below the national average. Although some strengthening is anticipated in Quebec's export industries, growth in domestic demand will be undercut by fiscal restraint, modest payroll gains and lingering political uncertainty. As a result, the province is expected to only partially participate in the national turnaround in consumer spending in 1997. <p>

<B>Part-time jobs filling gap</B><br>
Full-time employment growth has remained elusive for the province in 1996. Part-time jobs have been partially offsetting this weakness, rising by just over 5 per cent since last year. However, nearly 45 per cent of part-time workers in Quebec cited the lack of full-time positions as the primary reason for accepting part-time jobs - well above the 35 per cent response rate in the rest of Canada. Quebec is the only region expected to see a rise in the unemployment rate next year.<p>

<B>The fiscal squeeze</B><br>
Quebec's efforts to balance the books by FY99/2000 will cut into households' spending power. In contrast to the emerging trend of tax cuts in several other provinces, Quebec is paring back tax breaks for individuals and considering higher user fees. With diminished population growth and a lacklustre economic performance, further revenue-enhancing measures and spending cuts are needed to eliminate the deficit. <p>

<B>Lower saving</B><br>
The modest advance in retail activity expected through 1997 will be financed, in part, by less saving and additional consumer borrowing. While the national savings rate is expected to edge higher in 1997 after falling for four successive years, Quebec's savings rate is forecast to decline further. Consumer bankruptcies in the province remain the highest in Canada relative to the number of workers.<p>

<B>Pockets of spending strength</B><br>
While overall consumer spending growth has been soft, some categories have been remarkably resilient. In the past three years, healthy gains of more than 14 per cent have been recorded for discretionary items such as recreational services and apparel/footwear. In contrast, real spending related to motor vehicles is almost 9 per cent below 1989 levels. In 1996 and 1997, an average annual increase of less than 2 per cent is expected in sales volumes. <p>

<center>
<img align=top src="prov4.gif"><img align=top src="prov5.gif"><p>
</center>

<B>Home ownership increasingly affordable</B><br>
The Quebec housing market has been depressed, with starts running at less than half the pace at the start of the decade. However, the drop in house prices since the mid-1991 peak plus recent interest rate declines have dramatically improved the affordability of home ownership. In Montreal, carrying costs on an average-priced home now absorb just over 15 per cent of pre-tax family income - less than half the burden in Vancouver. In response, the Quebec housing market may finally be turning the corner -  MLS unit sales climbed almost 23 per cent during the first eight months of 1996. This year's upturn in home sales should also breathe some life into renovation spending, following the 11 per cent drop last year.<p>

<p>

<B>The turnaround</B><br>
A solid rebound in manufacturing and a number of service industries is underway in Ontario, piggybacking on strengthening exports to the United States. Improving domestic factors are reinforcing the upswing - a pick-up in full-time employment, personal income tax cuts and low interest rates. The rebound in private sector activity will more than offset ongoing public sector restraint.<p>

<B>Consumers step out</B><br>
Faced with a 9 per cent decline in real disposable income per capita from 1989 to 1995, Ontario residents have had to pull down their savings rate in order to finance even modest spending increases.  The anticipated pick-up in household spending power next year should trigger a solid 2.8 per cent rebound in consumer spending - second only to Alberta.   <p>

<B>Strong immigration</B><br>
Ontario's more positive economic outlook is expected to stem the net outflow of residents to other provinces in evidence since the start of the decade.  In addition, the province will continue to attract over half of all international immigrants - well above its 38 per cent population share. <p>

<B>Job creation kicks in</B><br>
Payrolls have increased by 67,000 workers since the beginning of the year, much stronger than the 18,000 increase recorded for all of 1995. Over the next fifteen months, another 130,000 new jobs are anticipated. The number of Employment Insurance beneficiaries is currently at the lowest level since 1989. <p>

<B>Growth in debt eases</B><br>
So far this decade, Ontario household debt has climbed at a much slower pace than the rapid double-digit rate reported in the late 1980s. Nevertheless, the household debt burden is still well above the national average. Sharp interest rate declines are giving substantial relief to families refinancing their liabilities. <p>

<B>Tax relief</B><br>
Personal income tax cuts will help the Ontario economy deal with the substantial drag from fiscal restraint. Households' discretionary income will receive another boost this January when the second stage of the tax cut is phased in. The promise of additional tax relief through 1999 should continue to bolster consumer confidence.     <p>

<B>Loosening the purse strings</B><br> 
The upturn in consumer spending should include stronger purchases of discretionary items that have been slow to recover from the sharp downturn in the early 1990s. For example, apparel and footwear expenditures - which are still down 10 per cent from the pre-recession peak - are expected to strengthen. <p>

<center>
<img align=top src="prov6.gif"><img align=top src="prov7.gif"><p>
</center>

<B>Housing demand is responding</B><br>
Declining interest rates have prompted a 26 per cent jump in province-wide MLS unit sales so far this year, led by a 37 per cent gain in the Toronto market. In response to stronger demand, housing starts are expected to rise to 50,000 units in 1997. While this increase accounts for over one-half of the projected national gain this year and next, Ontario starts will still remain well below the annual average of 94,000 units during the buoyant 1986-89 period.  <p>

<B>Agriculture underpins growth</B> <br>
The Manitoba and Saskatchewan economies are currently reaping the benefits of strong international grain markets. Manufacturing, mining and oil & gas activity are also boosting growth, highlighting the increasing economic diversification in these provinces.<p>

<B>Retail activity accelerating</B><br>
Retail sales have surged ahead almost 6 per cent so far this year, 5 times the pace in the rest of Canada. Department store sales are on track to turn in the strongest regional growth performance for the third consecutive year. After adjusting for inflation, growth in total consumer spending is expected to advance by nearly 3 per cent this year - second only to Alberta and well ahead of the 2 per cent national average. Moreover, retailers are expected to witness significant, albeit smaller, gains in 1997. <p>

<center>
<img align=top src="prov8.gif"><img align=top src="prov9.gif"><p>
</center>

<B>Unemployment remains low despite soft job growth</B><br>
Job creation has been modest in both provinces this year, but the unemployment rate still remains well below the peak levels reached earlier this decade. A pick-up in employment growth during 1997 is expected to lower the unemployment rates in Manitoba and Saskatchewan to 7.4 and 6.6 per cent respectively. <p>

<B>Per capita incomes rise</B> <br>
With wage and salary increases subdued this year, the agricultural sector is driving personal income growth. In addition to robust farm receipts from increased acreage and higher prices, owners of farmland are receiving capital assistance payments as compensation for the elimination of the Crow Rate subsidy.<p>

<B>Less onerous debt loads</B><br>
Manitoba and Saskatchewan continue to have the lowest household debt relative to after-tax income of any region in the country. Like the Atlantic provinces, it has a relatively light mortgage burden and its consumer credit outstanding as a share of disposable income is well below levels on the East Coast.<p>

<B>Upbeat mood</B><br>
Over the past year, consumer confidence in the Prairie provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta has been consistently higher than in the other provinces. The upbeat mood partially reflects the fact that these provinces are over the hump in solving their fiscal problems. With budgetary deficits eliminated, both provinces are moving to largely offset the drag from cuts in federal transfer payments.<p>

<B>Broad-based spending</B><br>
Over the past two years, rising incomes and lower debt loads have supported the most widespread increases in consumer spending across Canada. On a per capita basis, this has been the only region to report advances in all major spending categories. In categories such as recreation services, the shortfall in per capita spending from the national average has been significantly reduced since 1990. <p>

Purchases related to motor vehicles have been particularly strong and higher unit sales are anticipated. About one-half of households in Manitoba/Saskatchewan and Alberta own 2 or more vehicles compared with roughly 38 per cent in the rest of Canada. This higher ownership provides solid support for replacement and repair expenditures.<p>

<p>

<B>Topping the growth charts</B><br>
Alberta will lead provincial growth both this year and next, with most of its key industries turning in strong performances. Calgary's role as a transportation and service hub for Western Canada is increasing. Capacity expansions are widespread - further development is proceeding in the oil sands, pipelines, food processing, petrochemicals and forest products. Investment continues to be attracted by the low tax environment. This advantage is likely to increase as the province uses strong corporate income and resource tax revenues to accelerate debt repayment, laying the foundation for increased fiscal flexibility. <p>

<B>Attracting new workers</B> <br>
While Ontario and British Columbia will continue to receive the bulk of international immigration, Alberta's thriving economy is expected to attract increasing migration inflows. An influx of almost 6,000 Canadians is projected this year, the largest arrival since 1991.<p>

<center>
<img align=top src="prov10.gif"><img align=top src="prov11.gif"><p>
</center>

<B>Strong employment growth</B><br>
Job creation has surged by nearly 6 per cent in the past two years, roughly 2 1/2 times population growth. Employment opportunities have attracted 72 per cent of the working age population into the labour force, 8 percentage points higher than the rest of Canada. Consequently, more than two-thirds of Alberta's population over 15 years of age are employed, well above the 58 per cent national average.<p>

<B>Robust income gains</B><br>
Assisted by the lowest personal income tax rates in Canada, Albertans will lead both income and spending growth this year and next. Households' spending power will be further enhanced by the tax relief promised for low and middle income working families beginning this January. However, in this environment of rapid economic change, consumer and business bankruptcies are expected to remain high.<p>

<B>Housing upswing</B><br>
Alberta stands out as the only region where housing starts are forecast to be significantly higher next year than the average over the past decade. The relatively new age of the housing stock has been one factor holding renovation spending per capita below the national level, but the anticipated strength in home sales and income growth points to a pick-up in home improvement activity. MLS unit sales in Calgary and Edmonton have risen over 25 per cent so far this year. <p>

<B>Big-ticket items popular</B><br>
In Alberta, nearly 17 per cent of the population is in the 25-34 year age bracket, well above the national average. This is a key group for retailers because of their relatively large spending requirements. Alberta households also have had a greater propensity to buy big-ticket items in recent years, encouraged by the absence of a provincial retail sales tax. <p>

Spending on furniture and appliances has been more resilient in Alberta than nationally, where volumes have fallen 6 per cent below the 1989 pre-recession peak. The share of Alberta households reporting ownership of dishwashers, freezers and gas barbecues is about 10 per cent higher than in the rest of Canada. For products now gaining broader penetration, such as home computers and camcorders, Alberta's lead is building.<p>

<B>The expansion eases</B><br>
After surpassing national growth from 1987 to 1994, B.C.'s economic expansion shifted into lower gear in 1995 and 1996. Exports fell sharply during the first half of 1996, largely reflecting the impact of a global inventory correction on pulp and paper prices and shipments. A gradual firming in international markets for the provinces' key resources is expected over the next year, but growth will remain primarily driven by population inflows and the service sector.<p>

<B>Consumers pull back</B><br>
As in 1995, real consumer spending growth will be in line with national increases both this year and next. B.C. housing starts will remain essentially unchanged from the 8-year low reported in 1995. Household expenditure plans will be constrained by moderating income gains, the prospect of increasing fiscal restraint, high housing costs and, for many families, heavy debt burdens. <p>

<B>In-migration supports sales</B><br>
Although some softening is projected in international immigration and net interprovincial in-migration, B.C.'s population is still forecast to rise by about 2.5 per cent in 1996 and 1997, compared with increases of slightly less than one per cent in the rest of Canada. The West Coast has benefitted as the primary destination for business immigrants - receiving 36 per cent of the total compared to its 13 per cent population share. Over the past six years, B.C. has witnessed a substantial increase in the share of households with incomes above $70,000.<p>

<B>Lower rates lighten debt burden</B> <br>
With the highest level of household debt relative to disposable income in Canada, recent sharp interest rate declines bring considerable relief to many B.C. consumers struggling with heavy debt loads. Consumer credit as well as residential mortgage debt in B.C. have dramatically escalated during the 1990s. On the other side of the balance sheet, the run-up in B.C. house prices since 1989 has given a substantial boost to personal wealth.<p>

<B>Tourism takes off</B><br>
B.C.'s broad-based tourism industry continues to thrive, with recent increases in international airline and cruise ship activity providing an added boost. Tourism revenues from non-residents have climbed at an average annual rate of close to 14 per cent since 1990 - well above the healthy 7 per cent gain in the rest of the country. Spending by overseas visitors now accounts for one-half of the province's non-resident receipts.<p>

<B>Recreation/hospitality strength</B><br>
Provincial recreation and hospitality expenditures have soared during the 1990s, underpinned by the robust tourist industry. Restaurant spending per capita in B.C. far exceeds the levels in other provinces. Since 1989, recreation outlays have jumped 27 per cent compared to the 16 per cent national average.<p>

<center>
<img align=top src="prov12.gif"><img align=top src="prov13.gif"><p>
</center>

<B>The seniors' market</B><br>
B.C.'s attractiveness as a retirement destination is shown in the growing proportion of the population over 65 years of age. Real increases in personal health care expenditures have averaged 2.5 per cent annually during the 1990s - more than double the national average. <p>

Nobody likes to lock in their investment at a good interest rate and then watch rates increase.  But if you don't lock in, interest rates could fall and you may earn less.<p>



Scotiabank offers you an option.  Now in addition to competitive interest rates, the ScotiaPlus Expandable Certificate of Deposit offers you added interest rate protection for two years.<p>

<Ul>
<Li>If interest rates go up - you can "cash and extend" the term of your investment on the first anniversary for an additional 2 years at the higher 2 year rate with no penalty.
<Li>If interest rates stay the same or go down - just stay with your original interest rate and term.  Either way, you win.
<Li>As an added advantage, after 2 years you can extend your investment at the original rate for 1 more year.  Or reinvest at a higher rate if rates have increased.
</Ul>
<p>

Contact a Scotiabank branch in this country for more information about this service, current rates and fees, or how to easily transfer your existing business to Scotiabank.<p>

That's why we've introduced <i>Scotia Professional</i>&reg; Plan for Veterinarians -- a banking services package officially endorsed by the <b>Canadian Veterinary Medical Association</b> to meet the financial needs of its membership.<br>

<center><img vspace=10 align=middle src="cvma.gif"></center>

Guaranteed to save you time and money, <i>Scotia Professional</i> Plan lets you borrow, invest and complete your personal and practice's daily banking transactions all with one account.  No need to move funds to pay loans or earn interest and your bookkeeping costs are reduced.<p>

All this for only a low monthly fee.  And that adds up to great value for you.<p>

Consider all the ways <i>Scotia Professional</i> Plan can save you money<img align=bottom src="cross1.gif">:<p>



<dl>

<dt><b><i>All the Credit You Need</i></b>

<dd>We'll provide you with up to 100% of the cost of your business financing needs.  Repayment terms are flexible.  We'll defer your principal payments for up to two years and allow you the option of paying down any non-tax deductible debt first.  Whether you plan to lease or buy, you'll have ready access to credit at very attractive rates and terms.<p>

<dt><b><i>Our Best Rates</i></b>

<dd>Our loan rates are guaranteed to be 1% lower, on average, than our usual rates for comparable business loans.  These lower rates may save you thousands of dollars in interest over time, which means more money in your account.<p>

<dt><b><i>Preferred Interest Rate Paid On Your Business Account</i></b>

<dd>Unlike most business chequing accounts, the <i>Scotia Professional</i> Plan account pays tiered interest to ensure you a high rate of return on stipulated minimum balances.  No need to transfer funds to other accounts to earn our best interest rates.<p>

<dt><b><i>Pre-Approved Overdraft Protection</i></b>

<dd>Automatic overdraft protection of $5,000.  Save time by never having to make extra trips to your branch. <p>

<dt><b><i>Brokerage and Investment Services</i></b>

<dd>Discount brokerage services are available through <a href="sdbi.htm">Scotia Discount Brokerage Inc.</a>  For personalized investment advice, <a href="http://www.scotiacapital.com">ScotiaMcLeod Inc.</a> is your answer.  They will set up a personal consultation to review your portfolio at your convenience.<p>

<dt><b><i>Exclusive Savings on Personal Banking Services</i></b>

<ul>

<li>With <i>Scotia Professional</i> Plan you receive:

<ul>

<img align=right src="goldsm.gif">

<li><a href="scvisa.htm#gold">ScotiaGold&reg; VISA*</a> card.  Enjoy 22 day travel emergency medical insurance, 5% cash back on travel, money saving insurance and earn GoldChoice&reg; rewards points, redeemable for travel and merchandise rewards.

<li>the usual fee for a new <a href="pbssva.htm">Scotia Value Account</a>, a personal chequing account package that earns daily interest and offers unlimited chequing and selected everyday banking services, is waived for the first three months.

<li>a 1/2% interest rate discount on a new fixed rate mortgage (any term).  We'll guarantee the interest rate for 90 days and absorb any transfer fee (up to $150) assessed by your current lender.

<li>a 1/2% interest rate bonus on all new and re-invested Scotia Non-Redeemable GIC's (minimum 1 year term, maximum 5 year term).

<li>a 1/2% interest rate bonus for new and renewed term investment RRSPs of at least 1 year.  Plus we'll cover any competitor's closing fees up to $50.  <a href="sdbi.htm">Scotia Discount Brokerage Inc.</a> and <a href="http://www.scotiacapital.com">ScotiaMcLeod Inc.</a> are also waiving their annual administration fee for the first year on self-directed RRSPs.  Minimum balances are required for Scotia Discount Brokerage Inc.

<li>a 1/2% reduction off the target interest rate (adjusted for credit risk) for all <a href="crloans.htm">consumer loans</a> of at least $5,000.  And we'll cover up to $150 in appraisal costs for secured <a href="crplc.htm">ScotiaLine personal line of credit</a> and home equity loans.

<li>your first standard order of cheques.

<li>your first year rent on a new safety deposit box.

<li>up to $100 in cash bonuses for transferring your <a href="saveacct.htm">savings account</a> from a competitor.  Bonuses are paid at $10 per $1,000 on the minimum account balance maintained during the initial 6 month period.

</ul>

At Scotiabank, we recognize that running a successful professional practice is a big challenge.  There is never enough time to do all the things you want to do.<p>

That's why we've introduced <i>Scotia Professional</i>&reg; Plan -- a banking services package officially endorsed by several Canadian associations to meet the personal and professional financial needs of their memberships, including:<br>

<ul>

<li>Canadian Chiropractic Association

<li>Canadian Dental Association (New Dentist Plan)

<li>Canadian Psychiatric Association

<li>Canadian Veterinary Association

<li>College of Family Physicians of Canada

</ul>

Guaranteed to save you time and money, <i>Scotia Professional</i> Plan lets you borrow, invest and complete your personal and practice's daily banking transactions all with one account.  No need to move funds to pay loans or earn interest and your bookkeeping costs are reduced.<p>

All this for only a low monthly fee.  And that adds up to great value for you.<p>

Consider all the ways <i>Scotia Professional</i> Plan can save you money<img align=bottom src="cross1.gif">:<p>

<dt><b><i>Our Best Rates</i></b>

This statistical model, developed overthousands of hours of research, takes into account both compound and annual rates of return, the fund's volatility and how their performance compares with their appropriatemarket indices. All this means "emotional mistakes" can be avoided when buy/sell decisionsare made. Highly respected in the investment community, Chand Carmichael & Company Limited is headed by Ranga Chand, one of Canada's leading economists and the author of the nationalbest-selling annual guide, "Ranga Chand's World of Mutual Funds." He acquired his vastknowledge of both domestic and international economics during his tenure as a former directorwith the Conference Board of Canada, as well as during his experience as a senior economistat Canada's Department of Finance and senior economist with a major Canadian investment firm.A noted speaker, Chand regularly gives presentations and seminars to stockbrokers and investment counselors on investing in the global economy through mutual funds. As a mutual fund investor himself, Chand was looking for factual, comprehensive, unbiased information that would help him make his decisions. For this reason, he developed a statisticallysignificant model that would separate the above-average performers from all the other fundswith a five-year track record. The Scotia Leaders Program uses this very same methodology.<BR><BR><A HREF ="#TOP"><IMG SRC ="images/Ball.gif" BORDER = 0></A><A NAME ="Consistency"><IMG SRC ="images/Consistency.gif"><BR><BR>With the Scotia Leaders Program, there's no need to depend on subjective recommendationson what are consistent, above-average, Canadian and Global equity funds.<BR><BR>That's because each fund in the Scotia Leaders Program has a minimum five-year track record ofabove-average performance.<BR><BR><A HREF ="#TOP"><IMG SRC ="images/Ball.gif" BORDER = 0></A><A NAME ="ThePower"><IMG SRC ="images/ThePower.gif"><BR><BR>The strict selection process virtually assures on-going above-average performance.Only funds that have posted above-average returns over the past 1, 3 and 5 year periods areeligible.

<b><font size=+1>Transitions</font></b><br>

<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>

Transitions are events that concern practice value -- the business side of the dental profession.  Transitions usually involve buying or selling a practice, practice improvement, relocation, starting a new practice, associating or forming a partnership.<p>

Each of these transitions involves planning, negotiation, financial transactions, legal agreements and more.  The prospects of success for any transition are much greater if you have on your side experienced transition management professionals who combine a thorough knowledge of the business of dentistry with experience in providing financial and practice management services to the dental community.<p>

Such a combination was difficult to find until Scotiabank and ExperDent Consultants Inc. joined forces to create a uniquely qualified practice transition alliance.<br>

<center><img hspace=10 align=middle src="experd1.gif"></center>

<dl>

<dt><b>Making Transitions Work</b>

<dd>Successful transitions don't just happen.  They always require analysis and planning, and often require input from transition experts like ExperDent and Scotiabank.  ExperDent has years of experience helping dentists manage practice transitions.  Scotiabank understands the financial implications of transitions and through its <i>Scotia Professional</i> Plan has comprehensive programs in place to provide dentists with the financial support they need.<p>

<dt><b>Associates / Partners</b>

<dl>

<dt><b><i>Do you need an associate / partner?</i></b>

<dd>There are stages in the life cycle of a dental practice where bringing a new dentist on board will boost your practice value and give you some options: like continue to grow the practice, or take some time off.  Let ExperDent conduct a needs analysis to determine if your practice can benefit from such an arrangement.  Financial support, if required, can be supplied by Scotiabank for both yourself and your new associate.<p>

<dt><b><i>Would cost sharing, a true partnership or some variation be best for you?</i></b>

<dd>There are any number of associate / partnership arrangements possible.  Let ExperDent's experienced transition team analyze your needs and goals and help you to develop the arrangement that works best for you.<p>

<dt><b><i>What about the terms and conditions of associate / partnership agreements?</i></b>

<dd>In most cases, the cause of dissatisfaction with the associateship or partnership arrangements can be traced back to a poor agreement.  ExperDent's long experience in negotiating and drafting win-win agreements has played a key role in helping dentists from coast to coast to form long-term and mutually advantageous relationships.<p>

<dt><b><i>What if your associateship / partnership arrangement is not meeting your expectations?</i></b>

<dd>Let ExperDent analyze your arrangement, identify the issues, negotiate the areas of conflict and set you both on the road to meeting your goals.<p>

<dt><b><i>What do you do if your associate / partner's patient base isn't growing the way you think it should?</i></b>

<dd>The issues of referrals and new patient flow usually need some attention once a new dentist joins a practice.  As well, the transfer of patient loyalty from one dentist to another within a practice is frequently a slow process.  ExperDent's communications team can design strategies to help patients accept new dentists and increase the number of patients in your practice.<p>

<dt><b><i>What if your associate / partner is having trouble communicating with patients and working with the dental team?</i></b>

<dd>Associate / partner integration is an ExperDent specialty.  ExperDent's training helps associates / partners to work effectively in a practice to maintain a good working environment for the whole team and meet production goals.<p>

</dl>

<dt><b>Financing</b>

<dd>Scotiabank provides up to 100% financing for qualified purchasers, provides financing or leasing for facility upgrades at highly competitive rates and a full range of business and personal banking services that will save you time and money.  Financing is available through any one of Scotiabank's 1100 branches across Canada.<p>

<a name="prolease"></a>

<dt><b>Scotiabank ProLease Program</b>

<dd>Scotiabank's ProLease program combines all the tax-saving features of a traditional lease with the additional protection of life and disability insurance.  And with the ProLease program, there are no hidden costs such as administrative fees or extra advance payments required.<p>

<dd>From office furnishings to dental chairs to technology upgrades, you can use the ProLease program for almost anything your practice requires.<p>

<dd>With tax savings, equal blended payments, bridge financing to accommodate suppliers, insurance protection and highly competitive lease rates, the ProLease program is the answer to your leasing needs.<p>

<dd>For more information about the ProLease program, send us an <a href="email.htm">e-mail</a>.

With hundreds of mutual funds to choose 
from, it can be confusing trying to identify those with the best long-term rates of return.
No wonder hundreds of thousands of Canadians aren't earning the returns they could be.<BR><BR>

<CENTER>
<IMG SRC ="images/Table1.gif"><BR><BR>

</CENTER>

<BR><BR>
You see, most people evaluate a fund on the basis of how it's doing in absolute percentage terms. This
can be misleading. For example, you might be holding an equity fund that grew by 9% last year, when the
average rate of return for similar equity funds was 17.7%.
In fact, last year close to 40% of funds with a five-year track record were under-performers.<BR><BR>

<A NAME ="Strenght"><A HREF ="#TOP"><IMG SRC ="images/Ball.gif"BORDER = 0><IMG SRC ="images/Strenght.gif" BORDER = 0></A><BR><BR>

Now there's a way to invest in a package of mutual 
funds that have proven to be consistently above-average performers. 
Funds that potentially come from a number of well-known fund companies, such as 
Trimark, AGF and Templeton. The only service of its kind in Canada, the Scotia Leaders
Program provides you with two exceptional portfolios, one Global equity and one Canadian
equity, selected from hundreds of mutual funds. Each portfolio consists of five established
mutual funds from well-known companies. So you have the power of diversification not only
through a variety of leading funds, but through fund managers as well.<BR><BR>

You get high performance of leading Load Funds, without the high front-end or deferred services
charges.<BR><BR>

All mutual funds charge management fees, but as part of the Scotia Leaders Program, you pay
no separate purchase fees, no redemption fees, no monitoring fees charged quarterly, no switch fees, no RRSP fees no
sales charges - just one annual administration fee charged quarterly. And all or partial redemptions are allowed with
no penalty.<BR><BR>

The average fee you pay decreases as your account size increases.<BR><BR>

<CENTER>
<IMG SRC ="images/Table4.gif">
</CENTER>


<BR><BR>

For example: Account assets of $200,000 would be charged an average Annual Administration Fee 
of only 0.69%.<BR><BR>

From now until March 1, 1997, you can enter Scotia Leaders Program with a minimum balance of $15,000 - 
that's $10,000 less then the $25,000 you would normally require! If you don't have the $15,000
in place, we'll help you transfer your money from other sources in order to make the minimum.
Minimum subsequent purchase or redemption is $5,000.<BR><BR>


Applying for the Scotia Leaders Program is easy. Just fill out an <A HREF="/cgi-bin/Scotiabank/Leader/Survey.cgi">Information Request</A> today. For more
information, contact a Scotia Discount Brokerage or ScotiaMcLeod office.

At Scotiabank, we're ready to help you build a secure financial future. In this guide,
you'll find answers to your questions about RRSPs and how they work. You'll find strategies
for getting started and for growing your RRSP over the years. You'll also discover some
practical solutions and useful tips to help you reduce taxes and make up for some of the
years when contributing to your retirement savings program just wasn't possible.<BR><BR>

In short, this guide has been designed to help you answer the most important question about
your RRSP:<BR><BR>


	
Whenever you need to discuss your retirement savings program, come and speak to a Scotiabank
Representative who will be pleased to assist you. After all, we know that of all the investments
you make in your life, your RRSP could be the most important.<BR><BR>

<IMG SRC ="images/Ball1.gif"><STRONG><I>What are the advantages?</I></STRONG><BR><BR>

<UL>
<LI>Your contributions are tax-deductible and will probably result in a tax refund.
<LI>The return you earn on your RRSP investments accumulates tax-free, inside the Plan.
<LI>An RRSP gives you control over your retirement investments.
</UL>
<BR><BR>	

<IMG SRC ="images/Ball1.gif"><STRONG><I>What's the contribution deadline for the 1996 tax year?</I></STRONG><BR><BR>
Saturday, March 1, 1997.<BR><BR>
		
<IMG SRC ="images/Ball1.gif"><STRONG><I>Who can contribute?</I></STRONG><BR><BR>
Anyone, over the age of 18, who has "earned income" in 1996.<BR><BR>

<IMG SRC ="images/Ball1.gif"><STRONG><I>How much can you contribute?</I></STRONG><BR><BR>

18% of your 1996 "earned income" or the maximum amount of $13,500 that the Government
has set for 1996, whichever is less. If you belong to a Registered Pension Plan or
Deferred Profit Sharing Plan, your limit may be reduced. Your Revenue Canada Notice
of Assessment (which you received after filing your last tax return) will provide you
with your RRSP contribution limit for the current year. Your Scotiabank Representative
can help you calculate your maximum contribution.<BR><BR>
		
<IMG SRC ="images/Ball1.gif"><STRONG><I>Can you make up missed contributions from other years?</I></STRONG><BR><BR>

Beginning with your 1991 contribution limit, you can carry forward unused deductions indefinitely.<BR><BR>
		
<IMG SRC ="images/Ball1.gif"><STRONG><I>How long can you contribute?</I></STRONG><BR><BR>

Until December 31st of the year you turn 69.<BR><BR>
		
<IMG SRC ="images/Ball1.gif"><STRONG><I>What happens after age 69?</I></STRONG><BR><BR>

<UL>
<LI>You can cash-in your RRSP. 
<LI>You can transfer the investments in your RRSP to a <A HREF ="RRIFInformation.html">Registered Retirement Income Fund</A> (RRIF) or Registered Annuity, from which you must begin drawing retirement income. 
<LI>Any combination of the above two options.
</UL><BR><BR>



<IMG SRC ="images/Ball1.gif"><STRONG><I>The longer you leave your money invested, the greater the results.</I></STRONG><BR><BR>

During the time your money is invested in an RRSP, the return it earns is sheltered from
tax and that can make a huge difference to the value of your investments at retirement.<BR><BR>

Based on $3,000 invested annually each January 1st  with a 7.5% per annum compound annual rate of
return on each investment over the period. Non-RRSP amount assumes 40% income tax.
</TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR>
</CENTER>


<IMG SRC ="images/Ball1.gif"><STRONG><I>Can you contribute more than your limit?</I></STRONG><BR><BR>

Starting with the 1996 tax year, you can over-contribute a maximum of $2,000 during your lifetime.
You can deduct an over-contribution in future years - as long as you have contribution room against
which the deduction can be applied. If you exceed your $2,000 over contribution limit, the penalty
tax on the excess is 1% per month.<BR><BR>


<IMG SRC ="images/Ball1.gif"><STRONG><I>If your spouse is under 69, you can claim undeducted contributions in future years - even past age 69!</I></STRONG><BR><BR>

If you know you'll earn significantly more in future years than you do today, and you have income
to claim against, it may make sense to contribute to your RRSP now, without claiming the full
deduction.  Your money will earn tax-free returns now and you can use the deduction later,
when you've got higher income to claim against.

<STRONG>How to create your personal investor profile:</STRONG>
<BR><BR>

Investment products can be divided into three categories or "asset classes":
<BR><BR>

<STRONG>Cash or equivalent</STRONG> - such as savings accounts, Canada Savings Bonds and money market 
mutual funds (which invest mainly in high quality short-term money market securities 
issued by governments, financial institutions and corporations).  This is generally the
safest category of investments.
<BR><BR>

<STRONG>Income</STRONG> - including guaranteed investment certificates (GICs) and income funds.
Income funds invest mainly in Canadian and/or foreign debt securities with various
maturities, such as bonds, mortgages,  and debentures.  Income funds are generally
riskier than cash equivalent funds, but offer the potential for higher returns.
<BR><BR>

<STRONG>Growth</STRONG> - such as Canadian, U.S. and international equity mutual funds.
These funds invest mainly in common stock issued by Canadian and/or foreign companies.
This is generally the riskiest category of mutual funds, particularly over the short-term,
but offers the greatest potential for the highest long-term returns.
<BR><BR>

Your investment profile will determine your comfort level with risk, your financial
situation and the mix of these investments that will be most appropriate and best meet
your financial objectives.  This is called "asset allocation" and it has these advantages:
<BR><BR>
(1) When you invest portions of your money in each class, you are spreading your risk; when one
class isn't doing well, other others may carry it; and 
<BR><BR>
(2) You arrive at a "balanced return" instead of hoping to pick a winner.
<BR><BR>

An easy way to allocate your investment among the three asset classes,  in proportions that are
right for you is to complete the Scotia Investment Selector.  This easy-to-use online tool
will also prvide you with some suggesting Scotia Investment Products for your portfolio. 
You should review your plan every year, or whenever your financial situation changes significantly, 
to make sure it continues to meet your needs throughout your life.
<BR><BR>
After completing the Investment Selector, we suggest you meet with your Scotiabank representative 
for help in reviewing and making adjustments for your personal situation.

A university or college education pays dividends for years to come.  That's one of life's realities.  However, tuition, books, lab fees, accommodation, food and transportation all cost money.  For many bright and ambitious people, these costs may be too high... unless they get financial help.<P>

How you finance your time at school is a major consideration.  Scholarships, bursaries and grants don't have to be repaid and they are available from various sources -- private endowments, federal and provincial governments, special interest groups, alumni associations, corporations, trade groups, and the schools themselves.<P>

The competition for these awards can be intense and often depends on academic achievement.  To find out what's available and application deadlines, check your school catalogue or contact the Registrar's Office.  You can also get information from the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada, located in Ottawa (phone: 613-563-1236; fax: 613-563-9745).<P>

<center><img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br>
<b><font size=+1>What about government aid?</font></b><br>
<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>

The federal and provincial governments are major sources of financial aid.  Chief among the government-sponsored programs is the Canada Student Loan.  To be eligible for a Canada Student Loan, you have to show need based on your parents' or guardians' incomes.  Regular repayment of the loan must begin within six months after you finish full-time studies.<P>

There are several other conditions attached to the Canada Student Loan.  You can get full details and an application from the Ministry of Education in your province or from the Registrar's Office at your school.<P>

Provincial government loan programs vary from province to province and you should contact the relevant ministry in the province in which you reside or where your school is located.  Look in the government section of your telephone directory to find these phone numbers.  Like the Canada Student Loan, provincial student loans require you to pass a financial means test.  Scotiabank offers provincial student loans in British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec.  Call 1-800-9-SCOTIA or 416-288-4655 in Metro Toronto for details.<P>

<center><img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br>
<b><font size=+1>What other options are available?</font></b><br>
<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>

While the Canada Student Loan is an important source of aid for a lot of students, the fact is that many post-secondary students who apply don't qualify.  The <a href="StudentLoans.html"><b>Scotia Student Loan</b></a> was developed specifically to help those students who are not eligible for government assistance.<P>

<b>If you have additional questions, contact the Scotia National Student Loan Centre at 1-800-9-SCOTIA (416-288-4655 in Metro Toronto) or send us an <a href="email.htm">e-mail</a> with your questions.<p></b>

<UL>
<LI>You can make regular contributions to your RRSP through Scotia Pay Yourself Too Plan&reg; by
automatically transferring as little as $25 each month from any savings or chequing account.  Once your
Daily Interest Savings balance reaches $500, you can have the funds automatically transferred to a GIC,
which earns a higher interest rate.</LI>
<LI>Interest rate increases with your balance and is periodically adjusted to reflect changing market conditions.</LI>
<LI>Interest is calculated daily on your closing balance and credited to your account twice a year (at the end of
June and December).</LI>
<LI>No minimum deposit required.</LI>

<B>Description:</B><P>
Redeemable GICs give you the flexibility to cash them in whole or in part at any time (subject to certain
minimums).  This can be an attractive feature if you need money in an emergency.  If you decide to redeem
prior to the GIC maturity date, however, a lower rate of interest is paid.<P>
From time to time Scotiabank offers promotional GICs with additional features, such as convertible or
cashable options or non-standard terms. Ask your Scotiabank representative for details.<P>
<B><U>Benefits:</U></B><BR>
<UL>
<LI>Guaranteed interest rate<BR>
<LI>Liquidity<BR>
<LI>Security of principal<BR>
</UL>

<B><U>Features:</U></B><BR>
<UL>
<LI>Competitive rates and a full range of terms from 30 days to 5 years.<BR>
<LI>Interest payment options ranging from monthly to annually.<BR>
<LI>You can "reserve" a rate up to 14 days in advance on renewals and new purchases.<BR>
<LI>Can be renewed automatically on the maturity date.<BR>
<LI>Choose from GICs issued by The Bank of Nova Scotia, Montreal Trust Company and Montreal Trust
Company of Canada.<BR>

<P><P>
One of the harsh realities of having an income is that you have to pay taxes.  And these days it doesn't have to be a large income for the government to demand its share.  <p>

<ul>
<li>In 1995, if your annual employment income is more than $6,456 (after deductions), you will have to pay taxes.
<li>You are eligible for a non-refundable federal tax credit equal to 17 per cent of the tuition fees you paid in the tax year
<li>You are also allowed a federal non-refundable "education amount" of 17 per cent of $80 for each month that you were a full-time student in the taxation year.
</ul><P>

<center><img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br>
<b><font size=+1>What if I have no taxable income?</font></b><br>
<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>

If you are unable to take advantage of these non-refundable tax credits -- usually because you have little or no taxable income -- you can effectively transfer the tax credit, up to a maximum of $680, to a person who is supporting you, usually a parent, grandparent, or spouse.  If you receive scholarship money, the first $500 is tax-free.<P>

<center><img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br>
<b><font size=+1>What else can I deduct?</font></b><br>
<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>

You can also deduct the cost of moving your place of residence if it's at least 40 kilometres away.  Keep in mind, though, that the deduction of these expenses can only be made against taxable scholarship or grant money when you are moving to school.  If you move at least 40 kilometres from school to, say, take a summer job, you can deduct those moving expenses from your summer income.  Then when you return to school, you can deduct your moving expenses from any grants you may receive.<P>

Confused?  Drop into your nearest Revenue Canada tax office (check the government listings in your telephone directory for locations) and pick up a copy of the booklet Students and Income Tax (form P105(E) Rev.93).  Written in simple language, it is a valuable guide to types of income, deductions, and credits.<P>

<b>The first step in creating your student budget is to determine your total available income for the school year.  </b><p>
<ul>
<li>Use the form below to list your sources of income.
<li>If the row headings aren't appropriate to your circumstances, you can leave them blank or simply type in a new title.
<li>For income which you receive as a lump sum (e.g. scholarship funds, etc.) or for money earned in a job the previous summer, simply type the total amount in one cell, opposite the corresponding row heading.
<li>Once you have completed the form, click the <b>Calculate Income Totals</b> button to total your income, then click <b>Continue to Expense Form</b> to begin the next step: listing your <b>Expenses </b>for the year.
<li>If you would like to record this information for future reference, or for use in completing a Scotia Student Loan application, simply click the <b>Calculate Income Totals</b> button to request a table formatted for output to your printer (Note: printing of forms and tables may vary depending on your Browser type).

Why save?  Simple: it helps you keep more money in your pocket.  If you buy items using money you have put aside instead of borrowing the money, you won't have the additional cost of the interest owed on borrowed funds.  Moreover, the money you put aside in a deposit account or interest-bearing instrument will help you increase the value of your savings.<P>

A popular rule of thumb is to save 10 per cent of your paycheque.  This may be hard to do, but it may be worth a sacrifice or two to build a small nest egg.  It takes some discipline to get into the swing of it, but it pays off in the long run.  One of the big payoffs of getting into the savings habit now is that it will become part of your lifestyle and bring you major benefits down the road.<P>

<b><font size=+1>What should I do with my savings?</font></b><br>
<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>

As you accumulate savings, you need to look at the advantages of different savings instruments.  Most financial institutions offer special plans, like Scotiabank's <a href="PayYourselfTooPlan.html">Pay Yourself Too Plan</a> to help you get started.  It's a hassle-free way of saving because it automatically transfers a set amount of money from your chequing account to your savings account, or <a href="nonreg.htm">mutual fund</a> plan for both registered and regular investments.  Similarly, there are a variety of <a href="gics.htm">Guaranteed Investment Certificates</a> which pay a fixed amount of interest at maturity and are available for various terms from 30 days to several years, that can be purchased at any time.<P>

One of the most popular ways to save, of course, is by contributing to an <a href="RRSPCentre.htm">RRSP</a>.  What's unique about an RRSP is that it allows you to deduct the amount of your annual contribution limit from earned income.  So you get a "bonus" by paying less income tax for the contribution year and income earned inside the RRSP grows sheltered from tax until the funds are withdrawn.<P>

Starting an RRSP and making contributions early each year is one of the best routines you can establish in your personal financial plan.  Even small contributions made early have a stunning effect on the long-term savings growth in an RRSP.  And if you set up an RRSP as soon as you start working -- even though retirement may be little more than a distant notion -- you'll have a substantial retirement fund when the time comes.<P>

Click <a href="RRSPCentre.htm">here</a> for more information on RRSPs.  Your <a href="scolocat.htm">Scotiabank branch</a> in Canada also has descriptive brochures, and many third-party reference books have been published in the last few years.<P>

<b><font size=+1>The News</font></b><br>
<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center>
Recent changes announced in the 1996 federal budget have reduced
the mandatory conversion age of RRSPs (including any locked-in
retirement savings plans) to retirement income to age 69 from
age 71, starting January 1, 1997.
<P>
<center><img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br>
<b><font size=+1>The Impact</font></b><br>
<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center>
If you are age 71 this year, the changes will not affect you --
simply convert by December 31st, 1996, as usual.
<P>
However, if you are between the ages of 68 to 70 this year, you
must convert by December 31, 1997 (the end of next year).  This
means that if you didn't need the income from all your RRSPs and
were waiting until age 71 to convert, the new rules will likely
have an impact on your retirement income plans.
<P>
For all others, it means that when you reach age 69, you must
convert your remaining RRSPs into retirement income by the end
of that year, reducing the number of years of tax sheltered RRSP
contributions by two years.
<P>
In all cases, after converting your retirement savings to retirement
income, the regulations still state that you must withdraw certain
payments each year as taxable income -- even if you have plenty
of income from other sources.<p>
<center><img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br>
<b><font size=+1>
What Can You Do Now?
</font></b><br>
<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center>
There are a number of strategies and retirement income options
to consider that can help you minimize the impact of the new conversion
age or assist you in ensuring your retirement income plans meet
your expectations.  They include:
<P>
<UL>
<B>Key Strategies</B>
<ul>
<LI>Maximize any unused RRSP contribution room, before you convert
your RRSP to retirement income.
<LI>Consider taking only the minimum required annual withdrawal
and if applicable, base the payments on the younger spouse's date
of birth.
<LI>Gain a better understanding of what your current sources of
income are or will be and what type of income stream you will
require to support your personal retirement lifestyle.
<LI>Consider a retirement income option that allows you to withdraw
money for specific yet unplanned needs.
<LI>Use retirement income from your non-registered investments
first.
<LI>Keep contributing to a Spousal RRSP if your spouse is under
age 69 and you have earned income.
<LI>Review the impact of various payment frequencies and amounts
on your capital.
<LI>Hold fixed income products in your RRIF and hold growth investments
outside your RRIF to reduce your tax burden.
<LI>Consider diversifying the investments within your RRIF.
<LI>Seek professional guidance when it comes to complicated tax
or estate planning issues.  Good advice will improve your financial
well-being.
<LI>Get as much information as possible from your financial institution.
 Having a wealth of information will put you in control of your
retirement income planning and will help you make informed decisions.
</UL>
</ul>

<P>
<UL>
<B>Your Retirement Income Options</B><br>
There are a number of retirement income options available to you
including:
<ul>
<LI>Rolling your RRSPs into a Registered Retirement Income Fund
(RRIF).  For locked-in retirement savings plans, you can convert
them to a Life Income Fund (LIF) or Locked-In Retirement Income
Fund (LRIF), where available.
<LI>Purchasing a Registered Fixed Term Annuity to Age 90 (fixed
term and prescribed annuities are also available for non-registered
investments) or a life annuity.  Life annuities are only available through life insurance companies.
<LI>Withdrawing the full amount of your RRSPs and taking the full
amount withdrawn into taxable income for that year.
</UL>
</ul>

<P>

<P>
<B><i>Important</i></B><br>
Review and compare all the options available to you and weigh
the pros and cons of each.  Maybe a combination of income options
will meet your individual needs.<p>

<FONT SIZE = +1><STRONG>An easy, automatic way to grow your RRSP</STRONG></FONT><BR><BR>


<STRONG>A little goes a long way</STRONG><BR><BR>


Set aside a small amount of money on a regular basis and you'll be amazedhow quickly your RRSP can grow.
A Pay Yourself Too Plan automatically deducts a specified amount on a regular basis from your chequing or savings
account and deposits it directly into your Scotia RRSP.<BR><BR>


<STRONG><FONT SIZE = +1>Add up the reasons to Pay Yourself Too!</FONT></STRONG><BR><BR>


<STRONG><I>It's easy on your budget</I></STRONG><BR><BR>
		
You can contribute as little as $25 a month to your RRSP through a Scotia Pay Yourself Too Plan. 
Over the long term, that goes a long way toward building a comfortable nest egg, while still allowing you
to meet yourday-to-day financial commitments.<BR><BR>

<STRONG><I>Compounding earns you money</I></STRONG><BR><BR>

By investing regularly, you generate returns on the amount you invest each month as well as on the amount
that money has earned.  As a result of this 'compounding', your RRSP grows faster than if you made a single
contribution closer to the RRSP deadline.<BR><BR>

<STRONG><I>You can avoid the rush of last-minute contributions</I></STRONG><BR><BR>

Regular transfers to your RRSP can ensure you never miss maximizingyour annual contributions.
It can also help you contribute as early in the year as possible.<BR><BR>

<STRONG><I>You may be able to pay less tax each pay period</I></STRONG><BR><BR>

Rather than waiting for your tax refund, you may notify Revenue Canada of your regular RRSP contributions so
they can instruct youremployer to deduct less income tax from each pay cheque.  Pick up a Tax Deduction Waiver
from your local tax office or your Scotiabank branch.<BR><BR>

<CENTER><STRONG>How large could your RRSP grow over 25 years with $250 a month?</STRONG><BR>
$212,218
</CENTER>

<BR><BR>

This is what your RRSP cna be if you contribute $250 at the beginning ofeach month for 25 years through a
Scotia Pay Yourself Too Plan.<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE =+1>Put Dollar Cost Averaging to work for you too! </FONT><BR><BR>

When you invest a fixed amount of money in mutual funds on a regularbasis, the principle of dollar cost
averaging means you don't need toworry about trying to predict the highs and lows of investment markets.
<BR><BR>
Quite simply, when the unit price of a fund is lower, your money buys more units.  When the unit price is higher,
it buys fewer units.  Over time, this may have the effect of lowering the average cost of your investments compared
to lump sum investing.<BR><BR>

<STRONG><I>The Advantages of Dollar-Cost Averaging</I></STRONG><BR><BR>

By investing a fixed amount regularly, you use short-term price dips as buying opportunities.<BR><BR>

<CENTER>

</CENTER>
<BR><BR>

<STRONG><I>Make Time to Pay Yourself Too!</I></STRONG><BR><BR>

Even if you're living on a tight budget right now, try to pay yourself too by saving a little on a regular basis.
Before long, the power of compounding AND dollar-cost averaging will have you on the road to a more secure future.

<STRONG>Top up this year's contribution with a Scotia RRSP Express Loan</STRONG><BR><BR>

In order to contribute your maximum allowable limit for any year, consider a one-year
Scotia Plan&#174; Loan of up to $13,500 at Prime. You can defer payments for 4 months, then
use any tax refund you receive to pay off all or part of the loan.  You can pay off the
remainder in monthly payments of principal and interest.

The most widely used form of credit is <a href="scvisa.htm">credit cards</a>.  They allow you to purchase goods and services and, in most cases, they give you a 21-day grace period to pay your balance without being charged interest.  All credit cards charge interest on unpaid balances and many of them charge interest immediately on cash advances.  You should therefore be cautious about allowing your balances to get too high.  If your balances remain high for an extended period of time, the accumulated interest can be substantial.<P>

It's a good idea to shop around before deciding on which card or cards to apply for.  Compare the annual fees, transaction fees and the interest charged for unpaid balances and cash advances.  Look at the benefits each card offers; don't get a card if it has features you'll never use.  For many people, a basic credit card like Scotiabank's <a href="scvisa.htm#classic">Classic VISA</a> is all they need -- <b>and there's no service charge for students!</b><P>

<center><img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br>
<b><font size=+1>What cards are available to Students?</font></b><br>
<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>

As part of our Scotiabank student package we offer university and college students a <a href="scvisa.htm#classic">Classic VISA</a> card with a $500 credit limit and no annual fee.  Credit approval is all that's required.<P>

<center><img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br>
<b><font size=+1>How should I use my credit card?</font></b><br>
<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>

To help you use your credit card wisely, keep these tips in mind:<P>

<UL>
<LI>Don't use your credit card for cash advances unless you have to.  Interest is generally charged on the advance as soon as it is made.
<LI>Avoid using your card for small purchases, especially if there is a transaction fee.
<LI>Save your receipts and use them for a check against your budget each month.
<LI>Sign your credit card as soon as you receive it.  Keep it in a safe place and don't lend it to anyone.  If you lose your card or it is stolen, call the issuing organization immediately.  If you have a Scotiabank VISA card, call <b>(416) 288-4655</b> in greater Toronto and <b>1-800-387-6466</b> in the rest of Canada.<P>
</UL>

Finally, it's important to make your regular payments on <a href="StudentLoans.html">Scotia Student Loans</a> and your VISA card by the monthly due date.  Any time your payment is late, it is automatically reported to a credit bureau (this is generally true of all personal loans, regardless of which financial institution is the lender).  A poor repayment record could prevent you from getting a loan after you graduate and will limit your access to additional Scotia Student Loan funds.  On the other hand, a favourable repayment record will help you establish a good credit rating.<P>

<p><p>
Paying for tuition, books, and other school supplies may be your biggest expense category, but certainly not the only one.  The cost of accommodation will be another major expense.  As a general rule, living in a student residence is the least costly form of accommodation -- aside from living at home -- and residence contracts usually include some kind of meal plan.<P>

Many students, however, prefer to live off-campus.  Depending on the size of the community, you may have the choice of an apartment, a flat or a house.  To minimize your living expenses, you'll probably want to consider sharing with one or more other students.  Most colleges and universities have bulletin boards in the Students' Union or other key locations that advertise various kinds of accommodation.  You should also check the student and local newspapers, which are sure to run classified ads for rental accommodation.<P>

<center><img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br>
<b><font size=+1>What should I keep in mind when looking for accommodation?</font></b><br>
<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>

When looking at accommodation, make sure you get details on what the landlord requires in terms of a lease and a deposit.  This deposit may be in the form of the last month's rent.  If you'll be sharing, make certain all your roommates co-sign the lease and contribute to the deposit.  It's also a good idea to have a written agreement that spells out each person's financial obligations and the sharing of chores.<P>

When budgeting for accommodation expenses, don't forget that utilities such as water, electricity and gas often have a one-time installation fee or a month's charge in advance, and remember there's a connection charge when you get a new telephone line.<P>

If you are moving into unfurnished accommodations, you obviously will need at least the bare minimum of furniture.  Scrounging chairs, tables, beds and other pieces is for many a rite of passage into student life.  If your furniture has real or sentimental value, you should arrange for insurance coverage, especially if you own a computer, television, stereo, or other electronic equipment.  Check with your parents to see if their home insurance policy can be extended to cover your possessions.<P>

And don't forget to keep receipts of all your moving expenses as you may be able to deduct the expenses on your income tax from any employment income or award money that you receive.<P>

<center><img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br>
<b><font size=+1>What about budgeting for the year?</font></b><br>
<img align=bottom vspace=5 src="line.gif"><br clear=all></center><p>

Being a student doesn't necessarily mean financial hardship.  Even if you have to borrow money and work part-time to put yourself through school, you can still enjoy life and have enough money for entertainment.  With a bit of luck you might even be able to save a few dollars.<P>

At the core of good financial planning -- no matter what your circumstances -- is a budget.  You may think of it as something to be avoided, but a budget is an essential tool for keeping your finances under control.  Sure, it may be tempting to wing it or keep it all in your head, but to do so is bound to lead to some unpleasant surprises sooner or later.<P>

To set out a realistic budget, get as much information as possible about your living expenses and various forms of income.  If you have to guess at future costs, err on the high side.  Keep in mind that a budget is a management tool; it isn't cast in stone.  You should review your budget every month and make adjustments to figures as necessary.<P>

If your budget sets off alarm signals -- showing that your expenses are greater than your income -- carefully review your entries to make sure they are as accurate as possible.  If you still see a shortfall coming, investigate ways that you can earn or <a href="credhome.htm">borrow money</a> to make up the difference.<P>

A budget, of course, is only a tool to help keep you on course.  If you frequently exceed your budget, review your assumptions to make sure they are realistic.<P>

Before you develop your budget, you must decide what your financial goal is for the first year, then the second year, and so on.  As a student, your goal may be nothing more than making it through the year without incurring too much debt.  But when you start working, your goal may include saving money and buying "big-ticket" items like a car or a house.<P>

<B>Informed Investing Starts Here</B><BR>
<BR>
This guide is designed to provide you with details about some investment basics and assist you in shaping
your investment strategy.  It also describes some of the many <A HREF ="GrowthOptions.html">investment products</A> and services available to
you from the Scotiabank Group of Companies.  We hope that with this information and the personal
assistance of your Scotiabank Representative, you'll soon be enjoying the rewards of having a well-designed
investment portfolio.<P>
<A NAME="BasicInvestmentProducts"></A>
<B>BASICS OF INVESTMENT PRODUCTS<BR>
</B><BR>
The objective of investing is, of course, to generate some form of income or return from your investment.  It's
important to understand the <A HREF ="GrowthOptions.html">basic types of investments</A> because the way in which they generate income varies
by investment type and, as a result, they are treated differently from a tax perspective. The key types of
investments offered by the Scotiabank Group of Companies include the following:<P>
<B><I><A HREF ="pbs1.htm">Savings</A></B><BR>
</I>Savings investments include interest-bearing savings or chequing accounts, which offer withdrawal/chequing
privileges and allow you to access your money at any time.  Interest earned on savings or chequing accounts
is considered 100% taxable income. Scotiabank offers a range of savings investment accounts.<P>
<B><I><A HREF ="gics.htm">Guaranteed Investment Certificates (GICs)</A></B> <BR>
</I>GICs are investments you deposit for a fixed length of time or term.  The rate of return is guaranteed for the
term of the investment, so you don't need to worry about fluctuation in interest rates during the investment
period.  Interest earned on GICs is considered 100% taxable income.<P>
Scotiabank offers redeemable and non-redeemable GICs for various terms at competitive interest rates, issued
by The Bank of Nova Scotia, Scotia Mortgage Corporation, Montreal Trust Company and Montreal Trust
Company of Canada.<P>

<TABLE WIDTH = 602 cellpadding = 0  CELLSPACING = 0 BORDER = 0>
<TR><TD ALIGN=CENTER BGCOLOR ="#D9D9D9">
<FONT SIZE =-1>
<B>Note:</B> All Canadian dollar GICs with terms greater than 5 years and all U.S.
dollar GICs are not insured by the Canadian Deposit Insurance
Corporation or the R&eacute;gie de l'assurance-d&eacute;p&ocirc;ts du Qu&eacute;bec.<P></FONT>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<B><I><A HREF ="nonreg.htm">Mutual Funds</A><BR>
</B></I>A mutual fund pools the money of many individuals and invests in a broad range of investments according to
established guidelines and specific investment objectives.  Most mutual funds invest in stocks, bonds,
mortgages or money market instruments or some combination of these.  Because they are managed by
professional portfolio advisors, mutual funds allow you to invest prudently even though your investment
knowledge may be limited.  And because thousands of other investors (with similar objectives to your own)
are participating in the "pool" of money the portfolio advisor is managing, you may achieve a higher level of
diversification within the fund than if you were to assemble your own portfolio of securities. This in turn may
lead to higher returns and minimization of risk.<P>
Mutual funds can play an important role in helping you meet your long-term financial objectives.  Even if you
have a small amount of money, you can invest in securities markets in Canada and abroad through mutual
funds.<P>
Depending on the type of investments held in its portfolio, a mutual fund may generate interest income, capital
gains or dividend income.  Interest income is considered 100% taxable, however, you are only taxed on 75%
of the gains generated from the sale of any capital assets.  Canadian dividend income receives the most
favourable tax treatment due to the dividend tax credit.  Tax implications will certainly be an important
consideration when making investment decisions, so be sure to consult your tax advisor or Revenue Canada.<P>

wholly-owned subsidiaries of The Bank of Nova Scotia.<P>

<A NAME="BasicsOfRegisteredPlans"></A>
<B>BASICS OF REGISTERED PLANS<BR>
</B><BR>
Most types of investments can be held either as non-registered or registered (within a <A HREF ="RRSPCentre.html">Registered Retirement
Savings Plan [RRSP]</A> or <A HREF ="RRIFInformation.html">Registered Retirement Income Plan [RRIF]</A>) investments.  However, there is a
significant difference in the tax treatment of the returns on investments held within an RRSP or RRIF (and
these types of plans are also subject to various tax regulations).  Non-registered investments may be subject to
tax, while investments held within an RRSP or RRIF, including any growth, are tax-sheltered until the monies
are withdrawn.  The following outlines some basics regarding registered tax-sheltered products.<P>
<B><I><A HREF ="RRSPCentre.html">Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RRSPs)</A><BR>
</B></I><BR>
RRSPs provide you with a way to save for your retirement and shelter those savings from income tax,
although they are subject to Government regulations.<P>

Every year you contribute to an RRSP you enjoy two tax benefits: you may reduce your taxable income
thereby reducing taxes payable; and your RRSP investments grow much faster than non-registered savings
because the compounded returns are also sheltered from tax.  The Scotiabank Group of Companies offer three
types of RRSP investment options: deposit (daily interest savings, GICs), mutual fund, and self-directed.  At
Scotiabank, deposit and mutual fund investments may be held within one RRSP which provides one
summary statement on a quarterly basis (beginning December 31, 1996) for more effective and easier
management.<BR>
     <P>
<B><I>Self-Directed RRSPs</I><BR>
</B><BR>
A self-directed RRSP allows you to choose from the widest possible range of investment opportunities for
your retirement savings.  Qualified investments include mutual funds, stocks, bonds, GICs, money market
instruments, and foreign securities up to the 20% foreign content limit.<P>
To diversify your investments in an economical way with a self-directed RRSP, it's wise to have at least
$15,000 in your plan.<BR>
     <BR>
You can open a self-directed RRSP through <A HREF ="http://www.scotiacapital.com">ScotiaMcLeod Inc.</A>, our full-service brokerage firm, or through
<A HREF ="sdbi.htm">Scotia Discount Brokerage Inc.</A>, which will provide you with low-cost efficient trading services.<P>
<B><I>Retirement Income Plans<BR>
</I><BR>
</B>When you reach the stage where you need to draw on your RRSP for income, a Retirement Income Plan
gives you access to some of your money while continuing to tax-shelter the remaining investments. You have
a choice of converting your RRSP at any time to a Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF), or a
fixed-term or life annuity.  All of the money in your RRSP must be transferred, and the RRSP closed, by the
end of the year you turn 69.<P>
Under special transition rules introduced in March 1996, if you are 69 or 70 during 1996, you have until
December 31, 1997 to transfer and close your RRSP.<P>
With RRIFs, you can tailor the amount and frequency of your withdrawals to your needs, keeping in mind the
annual minimum amount required by legislation.  You can also change regularly scheduled payments at any
time.<P>
Scotiabank offers both RRIFs and fixed-term annuities. For further information, ask your Scotiabank
Representative for The Scotia Retirement Income Planner.<P>

<B><I>Locked-In Retirement Plans</B></I><P>
If you were a member of a pension plan with your employer and your plan was wound up, or you decided to
leave your employment, you may be able to transfer the money in the pension plan to a Locked-In Retirement
Plan Account (LIRA), Locked-In RRSP (LRSP), Life Income Fund (LIF), or Locked-In Retirement Income
Fund (LRIF).<P>
Locked-In Retirement Plans are similar to RRSPs with several additional restrictions. Depending on whether
you require income or not, you can choose a plan to suit your needs.<P>
The type of plan you can open depends on your age, and whether your employer's pension plan is federally or
provincially regulated. A Scotiabank Representative will be happy to give you more details.<BR>

You can hold an RRSP until December 31st of the year you turn age 69 (according to new RRSP
rules introduced in March 1996). Then you must convert or transfer the funds to either a
Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF), a Registered Annuity, or cash it in.  You may
even wish to do a combination of the above.  Under special transition rules, if you are age
69 or 70 in 1996, you have until December 31, 1997 to convert or close your RRSP.<BR><BR>

Choosing to cash in your RRSP is not generally not recommended as the full value of your RRSP
will have to be taken into taxable income for that year.  Withholding tax will apply before
you receive the funds, and you may be subject to additional tax when you file your tax return.<BR><BR>

On the other hand, converting to a RRIF provides you with an income stream throughout your
retirement years and only requires you to pay tax only on the income you receive in that year.
The true benefit comes from being able to have the remaining funds in your RRIF and the income
they earn continue to grow tax-sheltered.<BR><BR>

You can withdraw money from your RRSP at any time if you need to, but certain terms and
conditions may apply. If you are not certain about the total amount of money you require,
or for how long, you may want to consider transferring some or all of the funds from your
RRSP to a RRIF.  A RRIF can help you establish an income stream to meet your immediate or
long-term needs and as along as you are under 69 years of age, you can transfer the amount
in excess of the required annual minimum payment back to your RRSP when you no longer
require income.<BR><BR>

Throught the stages of your life, your RRSP should grow to become one of your most

<STRONG>Managing Your RRSP for Maximum Growth:</STRONG><BR><BR>

Consider your RRSP like a "basket" in which to place a carefully selected mix of investments.
There are literally hundreds of eligible investments, but most Canadians will be very well served
by diversifying amongst a selection of high quality GICs and mutual funds. The secret is to
understand your personal retirement savings objectives, and to make choices that will maximize
your chances of reaching your goals.<BR><BR>

<STRONG>Developing a Diversified RRSP Portfolio</STRONG><BR><BR>

By "diversified", we mean having several different types of investments inside your RRSP.
To meet all of your financial goals, you will want to put your money into three major classes
of investments, each offering you a solution to a different investment need:<BR><BR>

</TR>

</TABLE>
</CENTER>
<BR><BR>
	
A good way to get on the right diversification track is to use the new Scotia Investment Selector&#174;. 
It will take you through a straight-forward process,
resulting in a suggested investment mix that matches your stated goals and investor profile.<BR><BR>

The model investment portfolios provided show you a sample investment mix for each investor profile.
They are intended to be used as a guideline only. After working through the Scotia Investment Selector
to determine your investor profile, contact a Scotiabank Representative who can help you make the appropriate
adjustments for your personal situation.<BR><BR>

<STRONG>Stagger your GIC Maturities For The Potential to Earn a Higher Return</STRONG><BR><BR>

If you hold GIC investments in your RRSP, there is no sure way to predict where interest rates
will be when they mature. That's why it makes sense to stagger your maturity dates by investing
in different GIC terms. Then, when each GIC matures, renew it for the longest term, so that you
always maintain the same mix of maturities. In this way, you avoid having all your investments
mature at the same time. The GICs that mature when interest rates are high should compensate for
any that mature when rates are low.<BR><BR>

For instance, you could allocate your GIC investments as follows:<BR><BR>

<A NAME="ForeignInvestment"><A HREF ="#TOP"><IMG SRC ="images/Ball.gif" BORDER = 0></A><STRONG>Consider Foreign Investments</STRONG><BR><BR>

Many Canadians don't realize they can invest up to 20% of their RRSP in non-Canadian investments. 
Scotiabank customers have access to six foreign content mutual funds, plus the Scotia CanAm¨ series
of money market, income and growth funds.  Scotia CanAm&#174; funds offer foreign exposure while remaining
100% RRSP eligible.  By using "foreign content" inside your RRSP, you are getting the benefit of
greater diversification than is available in strictly Canadian investments, because the world's
economies tend to move in different cycles.  This means that lower returns in some markets may be
offset by higher returns in others.<BR><BR>

Maximizing your foreign content at Scotiabank will soon be easier than ever. As of mid-December,
1996, all of your Scotia RRSP savings, GICs, and Scotia Excelsior Funds investments will be
consolidated into one plan.  This means you can base your foreign content holdings on the consolidated
balance of your plan.  We can also help you manage these foreign investments by reporting them as a
percentage of your entire RRSP portfolio.  You needn't worry about going over the limit for foreign
content, because at month-end, your account is monitored.  And if you should ever exceed the limit,
we'll automatically adjust your portfolio to bring you back onside, and reinvest in the domestic
funds of your choosing.<BR><BR>

	
<A NAME ="AutoPilot"><A HREF ="#TOP"><IMG SRC ="images/Ball.gif" BORDER = 0></A><STRONG>The Easy Way to Automatically Maintain Your Asset Mix:  The Scotia Autopilot&#174; Service</STRONG><BR><BR>

When you first open your RRSP, you decide on the asset mix that suits you, based on your investor profile.
But over time, some of your investments will grow faster than others, with the result that your mix is
no longer balanced quite the way you want it to be.<BR><BR>
If you have $10,000 or more to invest in <A HREF="nonreg.htm">Scotia Excelsior Funds</A>, consider the Scotia Autopilot
Service. You begin by allocating the percentage of your portfolio you want invested in each of
the different Scotia Excelsior Funds you've chosen. At the end of every calendar quarter, your
portfolio's market value will be calculated and your assets will be redistributed to your original
percentages. This is called re-balancing. Only Scotia Excelsior Funds offers this service, at no
charge to you.<BR><BR>

<A NAME="SelfDirectedRRSP"><A HREF ="#TOP"><IMG SRC ="images/Ball.gif" BORDER = 0></A><STRONG>Enjoy Maximum Diversification through Self-Directed RRSPs</STRONG><BR><BR>

A self-directed RRSP allows you to invest in the widest range of qualified investments, including
equities, mutual funds, GICs, T-Bills, bonds, CSBs, and foreign securities up to the 20%
foreign content limit Ñ all under one plan.<BR><BR>

Opening a Scotia Self-Directed RRSP doesn't mean you have to sell any of your existing investments
or convert them into Scotia investment products.  It simply offers you a convenient way to keep all
of your RRSP holdings together so you can:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>adjust your portfolio at any time and take greater advantage of changing market conditions to earn potentially greater returns;
<LI>simplify the management of your portfolio;
<LI>reduce your administration and brokerage costs by dealing with one institution; and
<LI>maximize your allowable foreign content.
</UL>
We recommend, however, that you have a minimum of $15,000 for a self-directed RRSP plan.<BR><BR>

Depending on your investment objectives and preferences, you can choose either a low-cost
<A HREF ="sdbi.htm">Scotia Discount Brokerage RRSP</A> or a full-service brokerage Self-Directed RRSP through <A HREF ="http://www.scotiacapital.com">ScotiaMcLeod</A>.
Both are wholly-owned subsidiaries of The Bank of Nova Scotia. Your Scotiabank Representative would
be pleased to answer your questions about self-directed RRSPs or to provide you with an
introduction to an Investment Representative at Scotia Discount Brokerage or an Investment
Executive at ScotiaMcLeod.

Take advantage of your unused contribution with the new Scotia RRSP Catch-Up Loan.<P>

With Scotias RRSP Catch-Up Loan, you can borrow up to $50,000* at our very best consumer rates (as low as Prime). You can also take up to ten years to repay and even defer your first payment for 4 months!  This means you can arrange flexible manageable monthly payments, and use your tax refund to reduce the principle owing.<P>

of shanghaiing, are sold to the highest bidder... Bunco Kelly,
Spider Johnson and fourteen dead men on the deck of the <I>Flying
Price.</I>.. Urban East Hicks surrounded by Indians in 1886...earthquakes,
riots, robberies, murders and a host of other terrifying events
which created panic in the streets of communities throughout the
Pacific Northwest. Selected from the <I>Clippings File </I>of
the Tacoma Public Library's <I>Northwest Room /Special Collections</I>,
these true-life tales chillingly capture the dark side of of our
state's history.

<H2>Introduction</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="DDE_LINK1">Wobblies and patriots. Explorers gold-diggers,
bankers, printers, and newspapermen. For more than 30 years, historian
and journalist Murray C. Morgan entertained, enlightened and delighted
readers with his stories of the people and the events which played
a critical, and oftentimes humorous role in the growth and development
of Tacoma and the Pacific Northwest.</A>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Murray's People</I> is a collection of essays selected by Librarian
Gary Fuller Reese from more than 30 years of newspaper and magazine
articles, radio broadcasts, and books, by Mr. Morgan,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
What will you find here? Accounts of the leveling of Seattle in
1898; a mammoth hoax involving the discovery of a woolly mammoth;
Mark Twain at the Tacoma Theater; a Tacoma's teenager's encounter
with President Woodrow Wilson at the Stadium Bowl, stories of
the Wilkes Expedition, dirty political goings-on, and a young
cub reporter's scoop on the rescue of Amelia Earhart.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
These are terrific stories of a time past - a time when a world
was waiting to be discovered, when a man's vision could create
a city, and when life was lived intensely by people who were willing
to take risks and knew how to have fun. Enjoy!

</UL>

<P>
Persons who have acceptable personal identification, but who are
unable to provide verification of current residency, may have
the library card mailed to them to verify residency. However,
no library materials can be checked out until the Tacoma Public
Library card is received.
<P>
<A NAME="children"></A> 
<hr>
<h4>Library cards for children 14 years and under</h4>
Persons under the age of fourteen (14) must have the application

<A NAME="genealogy"></A><A HREF="tplgene.htm">The Genealogy Collection </A><BR>
Genealogy is the study of family history
and the discovery of one's roots. Tracing your family's ancestry
takes basic research skills, patience and time. Where do you start?
Easy - at the beginning - with your generation, and a trip to
the Tacoma Public Library. Included here is information about
the Library's genealogy resources and a listing of other World
Wide Web sites of interest.

<A NAME="photography"></A><A HREF="nwphoto.htm">The Photography Collection</A> <BR>
The Tacoma Public Library is home to
more than 1.5 million photographs of Tacoma, Pierce County and
the Pacific Northwest from 1888 to the present day. The collection
is a veritable treasure chest of riches for historians, researchers,
students, designers, architects and anyone curious about our past.
Eventually we hope to provide on-line access to the highlights
of the collection. Until that time, however, they are only accessible
at our downtown Main Library. Visit here to learn all about the
collection, the principle photographers represented and how you
can access the photographs.

excellence and high standards of research, as exemplified in the
distinguished career of author Murray Morgan. Visit here to learn
more about the prize, read about last year's recipient (Jack Nisbet,

the Pacific Northwest.

<STRONG><I>Genealogy is the study of family history and the discovery
of one's roots. Tracing your family's ancestry takes basic research
skills, patience and time. Where do you start? Easy - at the beginning
- with your generation. Then just keep working backwards - generation
by generation. </I></STRONG>

<P>
Begin with a basic family outline such as an ancestor chart. Use
a pencil as it's easier to make corrections and additions when
you find new information.
<P>
Organize your data as you go along. Take good notes and keep records
of the resources you use. This will save time and avoid repetition
as you continue your research in libraries, archives and county
courthouses.
<P>
The Tacoma Public Library's genealogy colletion is housed in the
Main Library's Northwest Room / Special Collections. Materials
in this collection do not circulate.
<P>
The Library's collection contains more than 5,000 titles including bound volumes,
microfilm, microfiche, compact discs, and periodicals.
<P>
The Tacoma Public Library's genealogy resources include censuses
(1800 - 1920), death indexes for Washington, Oregon, and California;
local obituary indexes and city directories; passenger lists;
county histories; cemetery, church, courthouse, and military records;
biographical indexes; family histories; books on names (both personal
and geographical); and heraldry books. Some materials are available
for virtually every region of the United States, Canada and several
European countries.
<P>
Additional computerized genealogical information is available
through the Internet and the World Wide Web. Computer work stations
are available at the Main Library's Reference Department on the
First Floor.
<P>
Library staff will assist you in learning to use the extensive
resources of the Tacoma Public Library as you embark on your voyage
of exploration and discovery into your family's past.

<P>
The Library's active efforts to acquire historical photographic
materials have resulted in a detailed collection of more than
one million photographic images. The collection contains a variety
of formats, including: daguerreotypes, glass lantern slides, early
and modern prints, panoramic photographs, ambrotypes and tintypes,
glass and film negatives, and more.
<P>
Images within the collection include the work of many prominent
and highly skilled photographers, including:

<P>
Diverse in scope and expansive in number, the Library's pictorial
resources offer an excellent reference source for researchers,
historians, students, authors, publishers, planning agencies,
and the general public. The photograph collection is available
for general use with the assistance and guidance of the Special
Collections Department staff. The best and most efficient way
to research a project through the Library's photograph collection
is to visit the Special Collections Department of Tacoma's Main
Library. Materials are currently available for public viewing
through photocopies in notebooks. The Library is in the process
of making this information accessible through a computer catalog
of images with related data. If you are unable to visit the Library,
please write detailing your specific interest or inquiry and describing
the needs of your particular project. Library staff will do their
best to accommodate you.
<H3>Accessing the collection through the Web <BR>
<I>(Coming soon - well, sort of)</I></H3>

<P>
The Tacoma Public Library will soon <I>(okay, sometimes within
the next twelve months)</I> be providing access to many images
in its Photography Collection through the World Wide Web. Complete
details will be listed in our Home Page when this happens.

Encompassing a broad variety of subjects, the photograph collection
is divided into a number of smaller collections covering specific
topics. The broadest topic for each subdivision of categories
is arranged alphabetically by subject matter and geographical
location. Smaller collections are filed by photographer. Major
subject headings and areas of specific concentration within the
collection are many, including such diverse topics as the following:

<H3><A NAME="using"></A>Using the collection</H3>

<P>
Reproductions of images are available and can be made at reasonable
costs through professional photograph finishing services in the
area. If a negative is not available, the Library will send a
print to a photo finishing service to produce a copy negative
and copy print, at the patron's expense. The negatives produced
as a part of this process become part of the Library's collection.
In this way, the public is constantly assisting in the evolution
and preservation of this valuable public resource. Please allow
7 to 14 days for processing.
<P>
<I><B>If a photograph is to be used for exhibit, commercial, or
publishing purposes, a credit citation must be given to the Tacoma

The Spanish came in the 1790s and used the names of saints, ships

Captains Vancouver and Gray arrived in 1792 and provided names
for about 70 places in the Puget Sound region. The Columbia River,
for example, was named after Gray's ship.

By the 1830's the British Hudson's Bay Company established forts at

<H2>Our Global Village<BR>
WWW Reference &amp; Information Resources</H2>
<HR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>The world, once upon a time, was as close as your nearest library.
Today, technology has brought the world even closer - into our
homes. Information once buried in books is now only a few keystrokes
away, accessible to everyone.. The world has changed. No longer
do we live in isolated neighborhoods, towns, cities and nations.
We have linked together as a global village. Our neighbors live
in Moscow, Paris, Oklahoma City. We chat with new friends from
Toronto, Amsterdam, Liverpool, and Madrid. We exchange information,
ideas, knowledge. Once upon a time this exchange took place over
the back fence, in the supermarket, at church. Today, it takes
place on a computer screen. We are all neighbors. We live in a
global village. </I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Here you will find links to sites with information about our
world stretching from Tacoma's neighborhoods to the far reaches
of the globe. These are sites which our reference staff use everyday
to answer questions, and provide information to our patrons. </I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>News sites will be added regularly as we find new and exciting
places in our global village to visit (did you know that more
than 400 new Web sites are created daily?!). </I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Depending on your information needs, there are two additional
sites you may wish to visit:</I> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>If you are seeking information on the history of Tacoma and
the Pacific Northwest, visit the Tacoma Public Library's Northwest
Room &amp; Special Collections Home Page. </I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>If you are an elementary, middle or high school student seeking
information for a school assignment, visit the Tacoma Public Library's
Just for Kids Information Desk.</I>

<H4>How ONLIVE! works.</H4>

<P>
The Tacoma Public Library's ONLIVE! communications software has
been specifically designed to communicate with the Libraries computer.
While anyone with a modem can access ONLIVE!, using the ONLIVE!
software with an IBM compatible computer will result in much better
service.
<P>
The software requires:
<UL>
<LI>IBM compatible computer (XT or better - 286 AT or better preferred)
<LI>2400 baud (or faster) modem
</UL>

<P>
Also recommended (but not required):
<UL>
<LI>Mouse
<LI>Hard disk drive
</UL>

<H4>Macintosh users</H4>

<P>

Public Library as follows:
<OL>
<LI>Dial (206) 272-6387
<LI>Set your machine to VT-100 emulation
<LI>Choose that same emulation when you connect to the Tacoma
Public Library.
</OL>

<P>
If you have problems connecting, call the Library at (206) 591-5666.
<H4>Obtaining Tacoma Public Libraries ONLIVE! software</H4>

<P>
The special library software needed to access Tacoma Public Libraries
ONLIVE! service is a 'self-extracting compressed file' (techie
talk that means a bunch of little files all squeezed into one
big file that does its own housekeeping the first time you run
it).
<P>
The software is available at the public access computers near
the Reference Desk on the first floor of the downtown Main Library
(1102 Tacoma Avenue South). be sure to bring a formatted diskette
(with 5 1/4&Oacute; 1.2 megabyte, or a 3 1/2&Oacute; diskette).
<P>
The Library software is also available to be downloaded from a
number of local bulletin boards (see the list on-line), including:
<UL>
<LI>Wood Creek BBS (206) 536-8480
<LI>Up Town's BBS (206) 572-2548

<H4>A Quick Installation Guide to the Tacoma Public Libraries
Dial-in Access Catalog</H4>

<P>
The software distributed to access the Libraries electronic catalog
is named Library.Exe. It is a compressed file comprised of multiple
files necessary to access the Tacoma Public Libraries dial-in
access catalog. To set the software to work properly with your
computer system, please follow the directions as listed.
<P>
1. Make a sub directory on your C: drive (your hard drive) by
typing
<BLOCKQUOTE>
C:\&gt;MD library [ENTER]
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
2. Change directory to this newly created sub directory by typing:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
C:\&gt;cd library [ENTER]
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
3. Copy LIBRARY.EXE to this sub directory. If your copy of LIBRARY.EXE
resides on a floppy disk in drive a:, then type
<BLOCKQUOTE>
C:\LIBRARY&gt;copy a:library.exe[ENTER]
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
4. To extract the files from this compressed file, just type
<BLOCKQUOTE>
C:\LIBRARY&gt;library[ENTER]
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
To save space on your hard drive, you may elect to delete LIBRARY.EXE
once expanded.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
5. To start your dial-in access, pick the command file which corresponds
to your PC system's modem set up, that is
<BLOCKQUOTE>
type 9600-1 if your modem is 9600 baud or faster and is connected
to com port 1;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
type 9600-2 if your modem is 9600 baud or faster and is connected
to com port 2;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
type 2400-1 if your modem is 2400 baud and is connected to com
port 1.; and so on....
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Once you have found the right command file, you may want to copy
it to a new file, perhaps named LIBRARY.COM. This will allow you
to just type C:\LIBRARY&gt;library[ENTER]
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
You will not need to remember the configuration to select each
time you are dialing in if you create this newly-named file.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4>If you are having problems...</H4>

<P>
In the event of problems, limited support is available by calling
the Tacoma Public Library at (2060 591-5666. Be prepared to leave

If your computer cannot successfully run the libraries software,
you can dial 272-6397, set your machine to VT-100 emulation and
choose that same emulation when you connect. Most options will
work successfully.

<I>Small business owners can learn how they can take advantage
of one of their biggest resources - the library - in a series
of free workshops sponsored by the Tacoma Public Library. The
workshops will be held at the downtown Main Library. While admission
is free, space is limited and reservations are required. </I><B>Interested
persons should telephone the Library at (206) 591-5666</B><I>.</I>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
&quot;These free workshops are designed to provide practical information
that can make a difference in the success or failure of a beginning
business,&quot; explained David Domkoski, the Library's Community
Relations Officer. &quot;So often, small business owners don't
know where to turn for no-cost assistance in developing prospective
lists of customers, researching their competition, or staying
abreast of business trends. The Tacoma Public Library's resources
for business owners extends far beyond popular business books
and the Wall Street Journal. We have sophisticated research tools
and information sources that most small companies simply cannot
afford to purchase on their own, and yet cannot afford to be without.&quot;
<P>
Additionally, said Domkoski, two other workshops on Library research
tools will be offered in the coming months, for both the small
business owner and the general public. Library staff will offer
hands on training to the variety of resources patrons can find
on the Internet and World Wide Web sites now available at the
downtown Main Library. Other workshops will explain how businesses
involved in import/export and international trade can use the
<I>National Trade Data Bank</I> to identify new products and markets,
locate trading partners, track currency exchange rates, fiscal
and credit policies, and follow the volume of trade between countries.
Domkoski encouraged persons interested in attending any of these
workshops to act quickly and make a reservation. &quot;The last
time the Library offered these programs they filled up very fast.
We really limit attendance to enable Library staff to provide
individualized attention and hands-on training.&quot;

countries; and information on new markets, products and potential
trading partners. The NTDB can be used to track the movement of

The Internet. The World Wide Web. The Information SuperHighway

many questions. Important questions, with answers which set the Tacoma Public
Library on a five-year voyage into the future.
<BR><IMG
SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">Communities
are in a constant state of flux. The needs of its citizens for information grow
and change. What doesn't change, however, is that citizens <I>need</I>
information. Information which is easily accessible, accurate, and up-to-date.
This information plays a critical role in helping everyone in our community
achieve success - be it in school, on the job, or at home. We are a society that
depends on information. The primary source for this information? The Tacoma
Public Library. This is a tremendous responsibility for the Library, as we must
be prepared to effectively and efficiently meet these ever-changing and
always-growing needs for information resources. We must insure we have the staff
and the resources to make this information available to the community. How do we
do this? What are our obstacles? What are the emergent needs?  How do we insure
the Library is ready and able to meet these needs?
<BR><IMG
SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">As
we set out to gather data and identify trends which would assist us in defining
a vision of what we needed to achieve over the next five years, these are the
questions for which we sought answers. 
<BR><IMG
SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">How
did we do this? 
<BR><IMG
SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">We
talked, asked questions and listened carefully to you - our patrons, and to our
staff. Through small groups discussions and a random sample telephone survey we
learned which issues were of concern to you. We surveyed the Library's
environment.  Finally, we came together with everything we learned, and created
a Strategic Plan which encompassed the following:
<BR><IMG

those challenges into opportunities for success.
<BR><IMG
SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">The
Strategic Plan, summarized here, is the result of our collaboration, and is the
blueprint of our action plan. It defines the Library's Mission and
Responsibilities, our Vision and our Goals for the future.
<BR><IMG
SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">The
plan is ambitious, and we will fulfill it to the best of our ability within the

from the Library to you, and from you to the Library.

Tacoma Public Library provides library service which is conveniently located,
during accessible hours, in a safe and welcoming atmosphere for all ages.
Reference service is of high quality, accurate and timely; library materials are
abundant, relevant and reflect the diversity of our society. Library materials
are acquired in many formats.

The Tacoma Public Library provides a basic service: access to information. The
Tacoma Public Library has a responsibility to provide equal access to
information and technology, and equal opportunities for learning, for all
citizens of Tacoma, regardless of economic status.

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">
The Tacoma Public Library's vision for the future of library services in Tacoma
addresses four interdependent  areas of concern:
<BR><IMG
SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="5"><BR><B><FONT
COLOR="#800080">Accessibility of Library Service
</FONT></B><BR>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">
Libraries must be readily and conveniently available to families and individuals
in our city. The  Library will provides 66 hours of service at all locations,
and Sunday service at Main Library and the two Regional Reference centers. 
Libraries should be open during times which are convenient to Tacoma's families.

<BR>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">
Library facilities will be clean, well-maintained, conveniently located and of
adequate size. 
<BR>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">
The Library will determine unmet community needs and under-served areas and
develop an appropriate action plan. Expansion of existing facilities,
rearrangement of existing interior space, and construction of new libraries must
all be considered. Any new facilities must explicitly recognize the necessity of
greater financial support to maintain them.
<BR><IMG
SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="5"><BR><B><FONT
COLOR="#800080">Financial Stability
</FONT></B><BR>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">
The Library must work to ensure that adequate and stable resources are allocated
from the City of Tacoma's General Fund. 
<BR>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">
The Library must develop additional sources of revenue, including grant
projects, community and business partnerships, additional revenue streams, and a
Tacoma Library Foundation. 
<BR><IMG
SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="5"><BR><B><FONT
COLOR="#800080">Improved Communications With Our Publics.</FONT></B>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">
The Library must take action to increase public awareness, through an improved
communications and Community Outreach Program, of the Library's mission and
services, and the contributions individuals can make to further that mission. 
<BR>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">
The Library must work to provide Tacoma's citizens with a better understanding
of how the Tacoma Public Library is funded.
<BR>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">
The Tacoma Public Library has an important story to tell. The Library must
develop more effective ways to share its story - especially when it concerns the
Library's needs, the challenges it faces, and its vision for the future - with
the community it serves.  The Library cannot expect to receive the support of a
community which does not understand how the Library works and why it is so vital
to the success of Tacoma. Tacomans use their Library heavily, but the
random-sample telephone survey revealed that there is a surprisingly low level
of public awareness of how the library is funded. This must change if the
Library's Strategic Plan is to succeed.
<BR>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">
The Library must develop a stronger communications process with the Office of
the Mayor and the Tacoma City Council. 
<BR>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">
The Tacoma Public Library must identify target audiences who can best utilize
Library programs, resources and services, and develop outreach programs
specifically for those audiences. 
<BR><IMG
SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="5"><BR><B><FONT
COLOR="#800080">Strengthening Library resources to effectively meet <BR>the
needs of our community.</FONT></B>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">
 The Library must provide a collection of materials and technology resources
which allows library staff to do their jobs to the best of their ability, in a
manner which is both courteous and responsive.
<BR>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">
20% of the Library's annual operating budget will be dedicated to the purchase
of books and other library materials, These materials will be supplied in
appropriate quantities and formats to meet the expressed needs of the public.  
<BR>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">
The Library will develop a process to acquire, maintain, repair and replace the
Tacoma Public Library's technological infrastructure.  
<BR>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">
The Library must promote a philosophy which allows it to respond to the changing
needs of the community. As those needs change, so too must the Library. 
<BR>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">
The Tacoma Public Library should be accessible to the entire community. What
does this mean? Collections which reflect the languages spoken in surrounding
neighborhoods, translation assistance, services and programs that meet the needs
of persons with disabilities, and a technological infrastructure capable of
meeting increasing sophisticated service demands. 
<BR>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">
The Library should provide materials which support both children's and adult
educational and literacy needs, and the needs of the burgeoning homeschool
population.
<BR>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">
Tacoma Public Library's staff is one of its strongest assets. The Library must
improve its internal communications program - communicating frequently and
consistently with Library staff to create a 'common ground' that fosters
teamwork and cooperation. It is especially important that all staff understand
the Library's mission, organizational values and responsibilities, and vision
for the future.
<BR>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">
In order to meet the existing and emerging demands for technological and human
services to specialized populations, Library staff needs specialized and ongoing
training which will allow them to excel, both personally and professionally, as
they provide customer-oriented public service.
<BR>
<H4><FONT COLOR="#800080"><A NAME="next"></A>Where do we go from here?
</FONT></H4>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">
Identifying the issues and concerns which the Library must address as it moves
into a new millennium is an important first step towards being prepared to meet
our community's present and future information needs. The four areas of concern
- financial stability, greater accessibility of services, strengthened
resources, and  improved communication, are all inter-related. Progress in one
area will contribute to progress in another.  
<BR>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">
Steps are already being taken in some of these areas identified in the new
Strategic Plan.  The Tacoma Public Library Foundation is now a reality; access
to Internet and Word Wide Web resources are now available at the downtown Main
Library, and the Moore and Wheelock Libraries; this newsletter was created to
share information about the Library with you, our patrons, on a regular basis;
the Mayor and members of Tacoma City Council now receive all news releases and
promotional literature from the Library to keep them better informed regarding
Library programs and initiatives; and the Library's proposed 1997 - 1998 budget
(currently being reviewed by the City of Tacoma) includes funding for reopening
five neighborhood libraries   Kobetich, Swan Creek, Mottet, South Tacoma, and
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Branch Libraries   on Monday.,  a slight increase in
the Library's budget for books and other materials, and $800,000 for upgrading
the Library's technological infrastructure.
<BR>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">
The plan outlined is ambitious, and the Tacoma Public Library  will fulfill it
to the best of our ability within the resources available to us.  The success of
this plan depends on communication: from the Library to you, and from you to the
Library.  We welcome your comments and suggestions.

<H2>Foundation established to enhance <BR>library services.</H2><IMG
SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">Recognizing
that a strong public library system is the very foundation upon which a
community can build for the future, a handful of Tacoma activists and library
supporters have established a non-profit foundation to seek private sector
support for the benefit of the Tacoma Public Library.<BR><IMG
SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1"><I>&quot;The
Tacoma Public Library is a critical resource for our city, addressing important
community needs&quot; </I>explained Henry Haas, president of the newly-formed
Tacoma Public Library Foundation, <I>&quot;and it deserves our support it needs
our support. While tax dollars built and now maintain a good library system in
Tacoma; private sector support is necessary to make that good system great.&quot;</I><BR><IMG
SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">Haas,
a former member of the Library's Board of Trustees, is a founding member of the
Foundation along with Thomas R. Stenger, Dean Martin, Molly Lane, Persis R.
Shook, and retired Library Director Kevin Hegarty.  A seventh director, Dr.
Ronald Magden, a Tacoma historian and educator, has just been elected to the
Board.<BR><IMG
SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">What
will the Foundation do? Seek contributions to support the Tacoma Public
Library's valuable collections of books and materials, for selected capital
improvements, and to expand services and programs which provide greater access
to learning for Tacoma's growing and diverse population. The non-profit Tacoma
Public Library Foundation, says Haas, will provide an attractive avenue for
tax-deductible gifts, trusts, and bequests. <I>&quot;We will work hand-in-hand
with the Tacoma Public Library to bring new learning and cultural experiences,
emerging technology and community services to children and families in each and
every library in the city of Tacoma. We will help the library fulfill its
mission by providing additional financial support, and creative resources&quot;</I><BR><IMG
SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">Haas
explained that the role of the Foundation is to provide funding for projects
which complement, but do not supplant, the City of Tacoma's responsibility for
continued maintenance and support of the Tacoma Public Library. The list of
projects under consideration by the Foundation's directors is extensive and
includes underwriting the annual Hug Family Lecture Series, the refurbishment of
the Northwest Room to create a home for the Murray Morgan Library and expanded
Pacific Rim Collection, ongoing support of the popular TEAM READ program, and
more.<BR><IMG
SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">The
Tacoma Public Library has a solid history of private sector support, the extent
of which may come as a surprise for most residents. Starting with a $75,000 gift
from philanthropist Andrew Carnegie to build the downtown Main Library in 1903,
the Library has utilized private gifts and bequests to build and/or purchase
land for the McCormick, Mottet, Fern Hill, Swasey, and Kobetich Branch
Libraries; to develop technology resources; to create specialized planning and
community outreach programs; and to enhance the Library's general collection.
Most recently, the Tacoma Public Library received a $2.4 million bequest from
the estate of Mrs. Virginia Helen Marshall  the largest single bequest in the
Library's history. <BR><IMG
SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">Henry
Haas is enthusiastic and optimistic about the Foundation's potential for
success. <I>&quot;Our job is to turn everyone in the community - individual,
families, and corporations - into library champions and investors. And while it
may seem formidable at first, it really isn't. The Library is a wonderful
investment in the city's future, our children's future. It's an investment that
pays terrific dividends. We are already graced with a strong library system, and
by working together, investing together, we can make it so much better.&quot;</I>.

of <I>Beyond Category: The Musical Genius of Duke Ellington,</I> Smithsonian
Institute traveling exhibition making its only Washington stop at the downtown
Main Library's Handforth Gallery from April 3 through May 15. The Tacoma Public
Library is one of only 30 libraries from across the United Stets to host the
exhibition (and its only appearance in Washington state). <BR><IMG
SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">Through
photographs, facsimiles, and the colors and graphic art of the period. <I>Beyond
Category: The Musical Genius of Duke Ellington</I> traces Ellington's pivotal
role in the evolution of the uniquely American musical idiom of jazz. It follows
the composer from his Washington, D. C. childhood to his life in New York City
during one of the most exciting creative periods in American history,
encompassing the Jazz Age and the Harlem Renaissance, and his worldwide travels
with the Ellington orchestra throughout his life. A special feature of the
exhibition is an interactive videodisc which allows viewers to see and listen to
performances by instrumental and vocal soloists from Ellington's orchestra. The
exhibit also contains an original video featuring footage of Ellington and
interviews with current jazz musicians about Ellington's influence on their
music and on this uniquely American art form.<BR><IMG
SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">&quot;We
are delighted to have been chosen for as a site for this important exhibition,&quot;
said Frederick P.S. Whang, President of the Library's Board of Trustees. &quot;It
offers the community an excellent opportunity to expand its awareness of jazz
and of Ellington's influence on the development of jazz during the twentieth
century. Ellington is a seminal figure in American musical history. He was an
innovative composer who created an extraordinary body of music with its own
sophisticated, highly individualistic sound.&quot;<BR>

Category: The Musical Genius of Duke Ellington</I> offers students in the middle
grades, high school and college a rare opportunity to explore the life, times
and music of one of our nation's greatest national treasures. Ellington's life
and work provide the building blocks for classroom activities in creative
expression, social studies, language arts, music and history. To enhance the
students' educational experience when visiting the exhibition, the Library is
recruiting and training volunteers to serve as exhibit docents. These docents
will provide background information on Ellington and jazz, expanding upon the
wealth of information already available through the exhibition text. Training
sessions will be scheduled early next year and extensive historical and musical
information will be provided. Volunteers hours are very flexible and include
weekdays, evenings and Saturdays. Persons interested in learning more about
volunteer opportunities for the Ellington exhibition should contact David
Domkoski, the Library's Community Relations Officer, at (206) 591-5688.<BR><IMG

<H3>Friends of the Tacoma Public Library's November 16th event celebrates
Northwest Authors and illustrators.
</H3><IMG
SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">Want
to watch a truly magical moment in a child's life? Introduce him or her to the
person who wrote a beloved book. The child moves quickly from disbelief and awe,
through giddiness and laughter, into a comfortable conversation about the people
who inhabit their shared fictional world. The connection between writer and
reader is tangible. It is a moment the child will always remember, and
wonderfully reinforces the oft heard message that 'reading is fun.'<BR><IMG
SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">On
Saturday, November 16, many of the region's popular authors and illustrators
will gather at the Anna Lemon Wheelock Library in Tacoma's Proctor District to
talk about their work, meet their fans, and autograph books. <I>Wild About
Books! </I>a celebration marking <I>National Children's Book Week</I>, starts
at 10 a.m. and continues through 3 p.m. and is sponsored by the Friends of the
Tacoma Public Library.<BR><IMG
SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">&quot;Autographed
books make delightful holiday presents for children and adults,&quot; explained
Patricia Miraldi, President of the Library's Friends group. &quot;But <I>Wild
About Books!</I> is more than just a book signing. These talented authors and
illustrators will talk about how and why they write, read their stories, and
answer questions about writing and drawing children's books. It's also a perfect
opportunity for teachers to meet and talk with writers they would like to bring
into their classrooms.&quot; Miraldi said that the Friends hope to make <I>Wild
About Books!</I> an annual event.

<H5>&quot;<I>Team Read </I>keeps middle school kids reading at
a time when there is the greatest chance to lose them as readers.&quot;
</H5>

<UL>
<LI>Jayne Isch, Team Read's Coordinator
</UL>
<HR>

<P>
The weather on this Saturday morning is typical of spring in the
Northwest - white masses of clouds float by languidly overhead
as the sun climbs through the brilliant blue sky burning away
the threat of rain. Saturday is a day that children usually occupy
themselves by watching television or by playing around outside,
but today there are seven kids gathered at the Anna Lemon Wheelock
Library in Tacoma's North End. They are talking about <I>Mrs.
Frisby and the Rats of NIMH</I> - the book they just finished
reading. The kids laugh and joke around, read passages and excitedly
share their favorite parts. What's going on? Why are these teenagers
spending their precious Saturday morning in a library talking
about books? The reason is <I>Team Read</I>, the Tacoma Public
Library's reading club for middle schoolers.
<P>
Now in its second year, <I>Team Read</I> was created by the Library
in response to a City of Tacoma strategic initiative to provide
worthwhile and educational young adult activities outside of school.
The free program serves kids ages 10 - 14 throughout the city,
and is currently funded through the profits from Library-sponsored
book signings.
<P>
Jayne Isch, the Library's <I>Supervisory Library Associate for
Children's Services,</I> coordinates the <I>Team Read</I> program,
providing training and support to community volunteers, and oversees
book selection. Jayne believes each group has unique needs requiring
the freedom to operate on its own level, at its own pace. The
only stipulation she makes is that the group leaders must keep
reading enjoyable. While parents are welcome to sit in on meetings,
she prefers the groups remain a place for kids can come together
and freely share thoughts and ideas.
<P>
The benefits of <I>Team Read</I>, explains Jayne, are as varied
as the kids who belong to the club. The program provides kids
with an opportunity to read and discuss books purely for pleasure,
develops stronger reading and comprehension skills by asking kids
to think about and form ideas on books, it serves as a peer support
group for young adults seriously interested in reading, and supplements
the education of a growing population of area home schoolers.
<P>
The importance of volunteers at the Tacoma Public Library is not
seen any more clearly than in <I>Team Read</I>. Without volunteers
<I>Team Read</I> would simply not exist. Currently, three facilitators
volunteer their time to lead the groups, Carla Moschetti, Jenelle
Stussey and Dr. Sid Whaley. The group leaders receive training
in how to direct and focus discussions, create interesting activities,
and make the experience enjoyable.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;This type of teen program is rare,&quot; </I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
says Jayne Isch,
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;and there is not extensive training information on which
to draw, so we're operating on a trial and error basis.&quot;
One volunteer even supplemented Library training by talking to
middle school teachers about effective teaching methods.</I> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4><A HREF="#topofpage">Return to top of page</A></H4>
<HR>

<P>
I met with Dr. Sid Whaley who leads the reading group which meets
at the Anna Lemon Wheelock Library. While each group is unique,
the volunteers have much in common. They are all very committed
to working with kids; they believe in the importance of reading;
and they enjoy every minute of their bimonthly meetings. Their
energy and enthusiasm is contagious.
<P>
This Saturday, a couple of eager kids arrive early and arrange
the meeting room to their liking. An expectant hush falls over
the room as Dr. Whaley enters. Everyone scurries to their seats.
Whaley sets the light-hearted tone for the meeting when he asks
everyone how they are and what's going on in their lives. The
conversation quickly turns to Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH.
The teens are invited to either read a memorable passage or to
describe their favorite scene and the unrestrained enthusiasm
with which they tackle this request swiftly reveals their enjoyment
of the book. Their voices become hurried when describing how the
rats escape their confinement. The young readers interrupt each
other as they make sure no crucial or exciting details of the
scene are missed. Sound effects provided by the boys in the group
underscore lively descriptions of passages from the book. It's
clearly evident that these kids are comfortable with each other
and are not afraid to express their thoughts on the book.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;It's not my job to teach the kids how to read, and I'm
not interested in forcing them to enjoy the books they choose
to read,&quot; </I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
explained Dr. Whaley.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;I'm just a go-between with the kids and the ideas the
author writes about.&quot; Whaley volunteers because he enjoys
the interaction with the club members, and hopes that by helping
them realize and express their ideas and opinion he can have a
positive influence on a small part of their life.&quot;</I> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Using hypothetical questions to create situations similar to those
in the book, Whaley encourages the young readers to look beyond
the story and discover its relevance in each of their lives. Current
events play a key role in launching and maintaining group discussions.
The subject of animal testing initiates a lively discussion during
which all opinions are encouraged and heard. It's important to
Dr. Whaley that every youngster has a chance to talk, and that
all ideas are treated with respect.<HR>

<H5>&quot;I like getting new books that I can read outside of
school and enjoy with my friends.&quot;</H5>

<UL>
<LI>Seamus Horn, seventh grader and Team Read participant
</UL>
<HR>

<P>
Wrapping up Saturday's animated discussion, Dr. Whaley brings
out two books - one of which the teens may select to read and
discuss at their next two meetings. The kids make their choice
and Whaley provides them their own new copy to read and keep.
Seventh grader Seamus Horn, one of the more vocal members of the
group, said that getting the free books is the best part of <I>Team
Read</I>. He also enjoys the freedom of reading the books on his
own time. <I>Team Read</I> appeals to kids like Seamus because
it offers a place to read books outside of the classroom. There
is no pressure for right answers or to mimic a teacher's opinion,
simply the pleasure of reading and discussing books.
<P>
Kids play a major role in deciding which books club members will
read next. Johanna Munoz, an eighth grader whose mother works
at the branch library, suggested Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH,
because she felt some of the earlier books were below her reading
level. Dr. Whaley admits that it is sometimes difficult to keep
all the kids' interest, but the program constantly refines itself
by listening to suggestions from the teens.
<P>
Saturday's session ends with cookies and soda, and the group begins
talking about softball, concerts, and movies. The room is put
back in order and the kids step out into the sunny afternoon with
new books in hand. They have spent an hour of their Saturday doing
what one might think teenagers would do virtually anything to
avoid - reading and talking about books.
<H4><A HREF="#topofpage">Return to top of page</A></H4>
<HR>

<P>
<I>Team Read</I> programs are currently available at the Moore
and Swasey Branch Libraries, the Anna Lemon Wheelock Library,
and at the East Side Neighborhood Center. <I>Team Read</I> operates
only during the school year, ending when the Library's annual
Summer Reading Club begins. If Jayne Isch had her way, the program
would be available at all ten Tacoma libraries. All it would take,
says Jayne,
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;is money and volunteers. Teens at other branches already
want Team Read at their neighborhood library, but the Library
can't start a program without first having a volunteer in place.&quot;
</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
And while <I>Team Read</I> can continue to maintain the existing
clubs with the funds generated from library book signings, Jayne's
goal is to find community sponsorship which will enable the program
to grow throughout the city.
<P>
Jayne Isch is optimistic about the future success and continued
growth of <I>Team Read</I>.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;The program works. Teens love talking about books and
ideas. It's a social and educational experience, and a lot of
fun. At a time when everyone is concerned about declining reading
and comprehension skills in school, Team Read provides part of
the solution to the problem. It needs to keep growing.&quot; </I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Scanning the enthusiastic faces of the teen readers leaving the
Proctor area library on a sunny afternoon, it's obvious that the
small investment in volunteer time and sponsorship money into
the <I>Team Read</I> program pays tremendous dividends.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;It's a win - win situation for everybody - the volunteers,
the community sponsors, and the teens. How can it not continue
to succeed?&quot;</I> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
For more information on becoming involved as a <I>Team Read</I>
sponsor or volunteer call Jayne Isch at 591-5641.

Library patrons, friends and colleagues are invited to a reception
for retiring Library Director Kevin Hegarty on Monday, July 22,
from 2:00 p.m. until 5:00 p.m. in the Handforth Gallery &amp;
Olympic Room of the downtown Main Library. Earlier this year Hegarty
announced he would retire on August 1. He has served as Director
of Tacoma's libraries since 1975, guiding the Tacoma Public Library
through a period of tremendous growth and expansion. Circulation
more than doubled (earning the Library recognition as America's
Best Read City in 1988), Tacoma's voters approved a $15.8 million
Library Construction Bond resulting in two new branch libraries,
renovation and expansion of 6 existing libraries and the Main
Library. A nationwide search for a new director is already underway.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;That Tacoma's libraries are the heart and soul of our
city is due, in large measure, to the vision and dedication of
Kevin Hegarty, The July 22 reception is a wonderful time for the
community to express their gratitude to all that he has accomplished
and to wish Kevin well.&quot; </I>

<H2>Taking the mystery out of meeting<A NAME="topofpage"></A>

make locating clubs and organizations effortless</H3>

<P>
One of the most frustrating experiences a person can undergo is
searching for people (or an organization) who share their interests
and concerns. You know they're out there - but you just can't
find them! The Tacoma Public Library has recently undertaken a
project which will end this frustration and make searching for
information about a club or organization as easy as turning on
a computer (or picking up a phone).
<P>
A team of Library employees - Anne Heller and Cheryl Giles of
Main Library's Central Reference, and Lare Mischo, Technical Services
Manager, are creating a computerized database listing current
information about organizations which meet the needs and interest
of area residents.
<P>
Anne Heller explained that details on community groups is some
of the most sought-after information by Library patrons.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;The database will quickly answer the primary questions
- who, what, where, when, and why - on every type of group imaginable,
from chess, bridge and volksmarching groups, to support groups,
professional associations, book clubs and outdoor groups. More
importantly, it will tell a patron how - how to contact the group
for additional information or to become involved.&quot; </I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Each listing includes
<UL>
<LI>the name of the organization
<LI>mailing address
<LI>phone and fax numbers
<LI>e-mail address
<LI>World Wide Web addresses
<LI>key contact people
<LI>a brief description of the purpose of the organization
<LI>and when and where meetings are held
</UL>

<P>
The database is searchable by keyword. For example, a patron could
search for all the antique car clubs in Pierce County, or one
specific club.
<P>
The public will be able to access the Community Information Database
in many ways: through computer terminals at the downtown Main
Library, at the Moore Branch Library and at the Anna Lemon Wheelock
Library; through a telephone call to the Tacoma Public Library's
Quick Information Telephone Reference Service (206) 591-5666;
and through the Tacoma Public Library's Home Page on the World
Wide Web (http://www.tpl.lib.wa.us). Organizations with WWW addresses
will have hot links within their record to their home pages.
<P>
Anyone wishing to have their club, organization or association
included on the Library's Community Information Database can pick
up information forms at any of Tacoma's ten libraries. Forms can
also be obtained by calling Quick Information at (206) 591-5666.
<P>
Send us your organization's information by e-mail. Just be sure
to include all the information listed above.

The Tacoma Public Library has become a roadside attraction on
the information superhighway's much-talked-about World Wide Web.
The Library's Web site (or <I>Home Page)</I> opened for visitors
earlier this month providing computer users in Tacoma and all
over the world with round-the-clock access to a profusion of information
and resources from their computer. Want to see what's going-on?
Check out the Library's <I>Home Page</I> at http://www.tpl.lib.wa.us.
<P>
The Library's <I>Home Page</I> provides users with a menu of choices.
You can access information about library hours, programs and services;
find tips on using the library; and learn about library resources.
There are special sections on news and upcoming events (this issue
of <I>InTouch,</I> for example, is available on the Web); and
links to lots of books, publishers and authors are waiting for
bibliophiles at the <I>Electronic WWWord Page</I>. You can visit
the <I>Home Pages</I> and fan sites of popular authors like Anne
Rice and Stephen King, novelist Pat Conroy, William Shakespeare,
and mystery writer Anne Perry (to name just a few). The full text
of all of the Bard's work, and that of Dante, Melville, Keats
and a host of other classical writers are readily available for
searching or downloading to your home computer<HR>

<H5>The collapse of the Narrows Bridge, how Vashon Island came
by its name and other intriguing history lessons waiting for you
on the WWW.</H5>

<P>
Interested in Northwest history? From the Library's <I>Special
Collections Home Page </I>you can search information databases
on <I>Washington Place Names</I>; a <I>Tacoma Obituary Index</I>;
<I>Northwest disasters, crime and punishment;</I> and <I>Northwest
Ships and Shipping</I>. You can learn more about the Library's
extensive genealogy and photography collections, or browse through
an ever-growing set of essays by Murray Morgan which detail the
fascinating people and events in the region's history. These are
resources unique to the Tacoma Public Library and are an important
part of the answer to the often-asked question of <I>Why create
a Web page?</I> Much of the information available at the Library
(especially the Northwest Room) simply isn't available elsewhere.
Providing access to this information - whether through books,
lectures, exhibitions, telephone reference or the World Wide Web
- is critical to the Library's mission.
<H4><A HREF="#topofpage">Return to top of page</A></H4>
<HR>

<H4>Just for kids (and their moms and dads, too)!</H4>

<P>
The Library's Home Page has something for everyone. Kids and families
can visit the <I>Just for Kids Page</I> to find information about
award- winning books and authors, reading lists of terrific books,
upcoming kids activities like the Hug Family Lecture Series, the
Summer Reading Club, TEAM READ and schedules of storytimes and
crafts activities. There's also links to other web sites like
the <I>Goosebumps Page</I>, San Francisco's <I>Exploratorium</I>
and the popular <I>Scholastic Books Home Page. </I>The <I>Just
for Kids Page </I>provides resources for homework assistance,
an array of reference assistance, and lots of places where kids
(or kids at heart) can have fun.
<P>
The Library's Web site will continue growing. New resources are
added virtually every week. The most recent addition? Reference
staff have assembled their favorite and most useful sites, searching
tools and other Web related resources in one easy-to-find spot.
The page is organized by subjects. Want the full text of the NAFTA
treaty, the plot of Andrew Lloyd Weber's <I>Phantom of the Opera</I>,
tax regulations, and small business resources? You'll find that,
and lots more! With 400 new WWW sites created daily, this page
is constantly changing and reflects seasonal and topical concerns.
<P>
Confused? Don't worry, you're not alone. It seems that news of
the Web, Internet and the Information SuperHighway is ubiquitous
and inescapable. Nearly every major magazine, newspaper, and television
network has featured stories about the Web, and everyone from
the White House, your local florist, record company and TV network
proudly advertises their Web address. So what? What does it all
mean? What is the World Wide Web (WWW) and why is it important?
Here are some short, non-technical answers.
<H4><A HREF="#topofpage">Return to top of page</A></H4>
<HR>

<H4>What is the WWW?</H4>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>The Internet and the WWW connect one part of the world to another,
they are information networks of information networks. The basic
difference between the Internet and the WWW is that the Internet
is text-based while the Web uses graphics (though the graphics
can be removed when viewing). Think of the WWW as a library, a
shopping mall and a community you can access through your computer.
You use a program called a Web browser that tells your computer
how to retrieve pages of text and graphics on the Internet. Embedded
in these pages are symbols (called links) telling your Web browser
where to find other related pages of information on the Internet.
When you click on a link, it loads another page of text and graphics.
One reason for the Web's huge success is that it is easy to use.
Really. All you have to do is point and click!</I> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>

<H4>What's the difference between the WWW and online services
like American Online and Prodigy?</H4>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>The differences are dramatic. These companies sell access to
their computers; think of them as giant bulletin board systems
owned and operated by a company. What you see and do with them
is limited to what the company allows you to see and do Their
chat rooms, special programming and content are proprietary -
that is you must be a subscriber to use them. They are not accessible
through the WWW, although they provide access to Internet and
WWW sites to their paid subscribers.</I> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>

<H4>I feel like roadlkill on the Information Super-Highway. I
don't have a computer. What can I do?</H4>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>The Tacoma Public Library provides free limited access to the
Internet and the WWW at the downtown Main Library, and at the
southend Moore Branch Library. Services will soon be available
at the Anna Lemon Wheelock Library in the city's northend and
the Library plans on providing access at other locations in the
future as funding is available. Currently, access to the Web is
limited to text only. The Library does not provide a graphics-based
browser on terminals for in-library use.</I> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>

<H4>The WWW . . . what's the big deal? Why should I care? What's
in it for me?</H4>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Lots. If you use INFOTRAC, the Library's magazine index, you
are already traveling on the Information SuperHighway. This popular
magazine service is providing full-text access to thousands of
magazine articles via the Internet. You can already read hundreds
of newspapers and magazines on the Web. The WWW is an inexpensive,
easy-to-use way to provides lots of information to everyone, regardless
of where they live. In many ways it is turning the world into
one large global village. Imagine, for instance, learning about
whales from the folks in California and Alaska who are actively
involved in whale research. With a quick click of your mouse you
can look at photographs, listen to whale sounds, and ask the scientists
questions about their work. You can visit the Vatican and view
their treasures, stroll down Parisian boulevards, or take a (virtual)
walk through the halls of the Smithsonian.</I> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
While the World Wide Web may seem new and different, remember
that it's really just a tool - another way of finding and sharing
information. Once upon a time talking pictures were new and different,
as was television, and telephones. Yet, these inventions changed
our world. They provided greater access to information to everyone.
So too does the World Wide Web. It's already had a profound impact
on society and it's less than three years old. Imagine the changes
and innovations we can expect in the next decade!

<H3>Kevin Hegarty, Director of the Tacoma Public Library, <BR>
to retire August 1</H3>

<HR>

<P>
Kevin Hegarty, Director of the Tacoma Public Library for the past
20 years, announced Wednesday that he will retire on August 1,
1996. Hegarty, 60, has served as director of Tacoma's libraries
since 1975. In announcing his retirement, Hegarty explained that
continuing health concerns prompted his action.
<P>
Under Hegarty's 20-year stewardship, the Tacoma Public Library
thrived.
<UL>
<LI>Since 1975, the Library's annual budget increased from $1.5
million to over $8 million.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>A branch library in Northeast Tacoma was added in 1980, and,
through voter approval of a $15.8 million Library Construction
Bond in 1984. The Main Library was renovated and enlarged, two
branch libraries in the city's east and central neighborhoods
were built, regional libraries were enlarged in Tacoma's north
and south end, and remaining branch libraries were renovated and
expanded..
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>Library circulation more than doubled - from 1.2 million items
in 1975 to 2.7 million in 1995 as a result of innovative customer
service-minded policies, resulting in one of the highest per-capita
circulation in the nation. In 1988, Tacoma was earned the title
of America's Best Read City from the Urban Libraries Council.
Steadfastly committed to enhancing the Library's ability to meet
the information needs of its citizens, Hegarty increased Library's
budget for books and materials from 9.8% in 1975 to a high of
19.5% in 1992. In recent years, the percentage of the Library's
budget spent on materials has been reduced as a result of budget
cuts.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>The Tacoma Public Library was recognized nationally for its
leadership role in the use of technology to improve and enhance
library services. Tacoma was one of the first libraries in the
nation to provide computerized access to its collection. The Library
pioneered in the development and testing of the <I>Intelligent
Catalog</I>, a innovative CD ROM based user-friendly computer
which replaced traditional card catalogs. The library made national
headlines when it began offering free computer literacy training
to the general public, and its Main Library computer lab is still
one of its most heavily used resources. Alice B!, the in-house
developed circulation control system set new library standards
with its easy-to-use interface, flexibility, dependability and
state-of-the-art integration of circulation control functions.
</UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;Kevin Hegarty led the Tacoma Public Library into the
21st century,&quot; </I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
explained Danna D. Clancy, president of the Library's Board of
Trustees.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;Under his visionary leadership and his unyielding dedication
to providing the highest quality library services to the community,
Tacoma built one of the finest and most-used library systems in
the United States. He guided us and others throughout the library
community through a technological revolution - from card catalogs
and books to computers, compact discs and CD-ROM - setting standards
of achievement that other library systems envied and emulated.
That the library plays a vital role in the intellectual, educational
and cultural life of the community is due, in large measure, to
the extremely high standards of performance and service Kevin
Hegarty set from the day he arrived in 1975.</I> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>I frankly cannot imagine Tacoma's library system without him.
He will be missed, both professionally and personally.&quot;</I>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Clancy's sentiments were echoed by other Library Trustees.
<P>
Trustee Dick Judy sad that Hegarty's retirement is
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;a terrific loss to the Library and the community - and
almost irreplaceable one. Kevin is not only a confident and highly
capable manager, he has unique qualities which extend far beyond
those which one would expect to find in a library director. Kevin's
vision for providing innovation in future systems services to
our patrons have will make for a much more difficult task for
the Library Trustees as we begin our search for a new Library
Director.&quot;</I> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Trustee Ella Crawford praised Kevin Hegarty's dedication to serving
everyone in the community - from children and families, to businesses,
schools and the city's diverse multicultural population.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;Over the past 20 years Kevin Hegarty has dedicated his
professional life to building a library system capable of meeting
the information needs of everyone in the community. Everyone!
He's had such a positive impact on this city The Tacoma Public
Library is the heart and soul of this community and Kevin is the
heart and soul of this library.&quot;</I> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
J Abel Corpus agreed.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;We, and Tacoma, will lose one of the best library directors
in the nation. It will be difficult to find another person who
will provide the vision, leadership and commitment to superior
and uncompromised library services which Kevin has championed
throughout his career.&quot;</I> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
As one of the newer members of the Library's Board of Trustees,
Frederick P. S. Whang appreciated that 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;I could always depend on Kevin's advice, and knew he
would answer my questions thoroughly - assisiting the other trustees
and I in exploring all aspects of an issue prior to making a decision.
He is without equal. Under Kevin's superlative leadership, the
Library has continued to successfully meet the challenges of providing
increasingly sophisticated information through innovative , consumer-friendly
services. &quot;</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Kevin Hegarty came to Tacoma in 1975 after serving as Director
of the Newport News, VA. Library System. He received his Master
of Library Science from Rutgers University's Graduate School of
Library Science.
<P>
Ms. Clancy said that the Tacoma Public Library will immediately
begin a nation-wide search for a new director.

<P>
The Library's 1996 Monster Book Sale is history and the numbers
are staggering. It took less than 20 hours to sell 38,000 books.
71 volunteers donated 248 hours to help set up, sell, and clean
up after the sale. And, the most important number of all - $16,138
was raised to support the annual Summer Reading Club and other
programs for young readers.
<P>
The Library is especially grateful for the support it received
from the management of the Tacoma Mall which, for the past five
years, has provided space for the sale; to Clare Petrich, of Petrich
Marine Dock, who has provided storage space for thousands of used
books; and to all the volunteers who generously gave their time
and talents to make the book sale a monstrous success.<HR>

<H4>TEAM READ Volunteers </H4>

<P>
TEAM READ is a reading club for kids 10 - 14 years old. Members
meet twice monthly to discuss the books they're reading. The Tacoma
Public Library provides the books (which the club members get
to keep), the snacks, and a discussion leader. The primary goals
of the TEAM READ program are to help kids think about what they're
reading, and help them learn that reading good literature can
be fun.
<P>
Volunteer discussion leaders are needed to help make TEAM READ
a success.
<P>
Volunteers lead discussions and activities which help kids think
about what they're reading. The volunteers communicate the needs
of the club to the Children's Services Coordinator. Each volunteer
(a club can have more than one) has the freedom to shape the club
to meet the unique needs of its members. Volunteers and members
are welcome to suggest books to read and club activities. Training
and ongoing support is provided for all volunteers.
<P>
TEAM READ clubs are being created all over the city of Tacoma.
Some meet at branch libraries, and some at neighborhood centers.
Meeting times and dates vary by location. Each club meets for
one hour every two weeks while school is in session. TEAM READ
clubs currently do not meet during the summer months.
<P>
Volunteers are asked to commit to leading two one-hour meetings
per month, with a minimum of a nine month commitment to the TEAM
READ program to insure continuity. Volunteers typically spend
an additional one to two hours preparing for each meeting. The
Library provides all materials for activities and necessary.
<P>
For more information on the TEAM READ program, call Jayne isch
at (206) 591-5641.
<H4>Summer Reading Club Volunteers</H4>

<P>
The Tacoma Public Library is about to be invaded by a very friendly
force of about 4,500 young readers eager to talk about the marvelous,
magical and wonderful books they have been reading as part of
our 1996 Summer Reading Club. Help! We need volunteers to listen
to these book reports, assist at popular crafts activities (ideal
for someone who enjoys pasting little beady eyes on 66 paper cleaner
caterpillar), and help keep track of the books children have been
reading.
<P>
Must love being around children. Patience and good listening skills
a must. Hours and locations are flexible. Must be 18 years old
(or older). Training provided. Volunteers will be fingerprinted.
For more information call the Library at (206) 591-5666.
<H4>Sort books for the 1997 Book Sale</H4>

<P>
No sooner do we finish one book sale than we start getting ready
for the next one. Volunteers are needed to sort books by genre
at the Mottet Branch Library on Tacoma's eastside. Days and hours
are flexible. Must be at least 18 years old and enjoy working
independently. For more information call Tomm Munro at 591-5607.

SEATTLE ARSON.<br>
<br>
Eugene H. Methvin, "Stalking the Seattle specter," <B>The Reader's Digest.</B> CXLIII (December, 1993), p. 115-120.<br>
<br>
Racing through the streets of Lynwood, Washington, at 2:22 a.m. fire fighters could see the flames blocks away. "This is a big one," they radioed, sounding a second alarm.<br>
<br>
On a secluded cul de sac, they found a home under construction enveloped in fire. As they fought the blaze, flames erupted from another unfinished house next door.<br>
<br>
After dousing the new outbreak, fire fighters found evidence of arson: on the second floor, someone had taken a pile of construction debris, leaned a roll of tar paper against the wall for added combustion and ignited them.  And he was still at it.  By daybreak, August 6, 1992, three more fires had been set in the quiet suburb of Seattle.<br>
<br>
Three days later, in the early hours of Sunday,- fire fighters raced to a fire at Lynnwood-Alliance Church.  Within the hour, one more unfinished home burned to the round.  Then fire fighters had to race an inferno at 'Trinity Lutheran Church.  Worshipers arriving that morning found only the smoldering remains of their beautiful old church.<br>
<br>
When his bedside phone rang before dawn that Sundry morning Dane Whetsel jerked wide awake. As a special arson investigator for the US.  Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) in Seattle, Whetsel was accustomed to such reveilles.  The boyish, six-foot-four-inch former defense lawyer had joined ATF because he preferred chasing criminals to defending them.<br>
<br>
"We may have a serial arsonist trying to burn us out," a Lynnwood. fire investigator told him' "Can you come look?" By coincidence, Whetsel had just attended a special course on serial arsonists at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Va.<br>
<br>
Whetsel spent the morning at the charred Trinity Lutheran Church and then toured the other fire sites, each in a secluded spot.  The arsonist used materials at hand, so he needed to carry only a lighter.  He covered his piles of debris with a flammable "tepee" a tar paper roll perhaps, or a doormat.  You can seen the same signature everywhere, Whetsel thought. But there were no leads and no witnesses.<br>

<br>
Seventeen days later the  arsonist began striking again; two churches in three days, and then, on Labor Day, an office building. Just 29 minutes after engines roared away to fight that fire, a new blaze erupted forty years from the now vacant fire house.<br>
<br>
Whetsel sent his mentor at Quantico, ATF special agent Gus Gary, photos of fire scenes and maps showing distances and driving times between them.<br>
<br>
Then the two got on the phone.  Both knew that most arsonists are undisciplined, disorganized males who set their fires within walking distance of their own homes.  But this arsonist was different.<br>
"You've got yourself a big-leaguer," counseled Gary, a slow-talking veteran from Alabama.  "He drives a car boldly throughout the area.  He knows fire-department procedures.  He'll grow more daring and dangerous until you catch him.<br>
<br>
The next Monday night the arsonist set a four-alarm blaze at a lumber company in Seattle and, within two hours, torched a bakery.  That Thursday, 30 miles to the south in Tacoma, an $8-million fire wrecked a warehouse.<br>
<br>
He's tired of toying with local fire departments. Whetsel thought. Now he wants to terrorize the whole area.<br>
<br>
On the night of September 19, the Seattle fire phantom turned the terror up a deadly degree.  Randy and Kim Pennington were asleep when passers-by banged on their door.  The couple smelled smoke and saw a horrifying red glow.  Kim woke their nine-year-old son, and Randy their six-week-old moments before the fire broke through the wall of the baby's room.  The house was gutted.  That night three other occupied homes in the same neighborhood north of Seattle were torched.<br>
<br>
Finally, on September 28, the arsonist left the first solid clue to his identity. About ten p.m. he removed a window screen at the Anderson Retirement Home, climbed in and ignited a bedspread. A sprinkler system suppressed the fire and detectives later found two fingerprints on the screen. Unfortunately the prints matched none in law enforcement files.<br>
<br>
By October investigators had attributed-31 fires to the phantom fire-setter.  As panic spread, firemen urged residents to report suspicious activity, test smoke alarms, practice home evacuation Neighborhood Watch groups and all-night patrols formed, and<br>
callers flooded tipster phone lines.<br>
<br>
Pooling the efforts of twenty-seven federal, state and local agencies, the ATF launched a special response team.  Whetsel and Seattle fire lieutenant Randy Litchfield, a former college
quarterback, directed the hunt.  They gave their quarry the code name Specter.<br>
<br>
Their phantom will-o'-the-wisp took human shape ear day, October 3. After setting three fires in Everett about midnight, he began sparking buildings near downtown Seattle. About 3 a.m. neighbors heard windows popping and discovered the house of Helen Allen, a 93-year-old widow, ablaze.  They rushed to the door and helped her get out.  Fires were raging through;ut the neighborhood, 12 set in less than four fours.<br>
<br>
Parked -on a side street, a couple noticed a sedan pull to a stop.  A neatly dressed man left his car and walked between two homes with what looked like a cellular phone at his ear.  Within a minute, he drove off as flames broke out.  The couple dashed off to sound the alarm.<br>
<br>
"Specter has a body!" Litchfield exclaimed when the report came in.<br>
<br>
"And he's listening to police and fire frequencies on a portable radio scanner."<br>
<br>
By late October, some 70 fires bore Specter's clear signature and Gus Gary came to Seattle to develop psychological profile.  "When you a finally catch him," he briefed the investigators, "he will probably turn out to unmarried, a loner with an explosive temper who performed poorly in school.  He's probably a traveling salesman, vain about his appearance, and he drives lots of miles nocturnally.<br>
<br>
" Driving is power to serial criminals; they feel in absolute<br>
control behind the wheel."<br>
<br>
Gary theorized the arsonist was a "fire buff" who lived near his first fires.  As he gained confidence, he spread farther afield.  He could be drinking or using drugs, and some traumatic event that summer had triggered his rampage.<br>
<br>
A drunk walking unsteadily home from a bar on November 2 saw a Dodge snap a U turn, whip into a side street and cruise slowly by an alley.  Soon fire engines arrived to douse a fire there.  The witness noted the car was new, with a temporary tag in the window and a dealer's advertising card in the license-plate bracket.  He thought the card read <B>"Chrysler" in cursive</B> gold letters on<br>
black.<br>
<br>
Whetsel had detectives contact every auto dealer who might have sold the car and every ad agency that might have prepared the card. At the Keller Advertising Agency, owner George Keller felt his heart freeze when he was contacted.  Keller's son Paul, 26, his top salesman, was a lifelong "fire buff." And George had just bought a
new Dodge for him from a client car agency.  But when a detective described the advertising card, Keller breathed a sigh of relief.  The card he'd prepared for that dealer-client said "Dodge" in roman lettering, black on gold, not a cursive "Chrysler" in gold on black.  He warned Paul, "You better get your permanent plates or you're going to be mistaken for the arsonist."<br>
<br>
On November 17 Specter again appeared in the flesh.  A young<br>
woman in a phone booth almost 100 miles east of Seattle saw a man stop at a vacant building.  As smoke began pouring out, the man sped away.  Police broadcast the woman's description of the car.  In Cle Elum, 15 miles away, a police officer noticed a car matching the description outside D&j Exxon.  But when he saw the car's owner, a well-dressed man in a suit, he thought, That's a businessman-not an arsonist.<br>
<br>
A short time later, Bonnie Spurrier was watching a building burn when a car wheeled in.  The driver got out and stood next to her.  He seemed excited about the fire, and Spurrier noticed that he had been drinking.<br>
<br>
She reported the odd encounter to  a friend who was a fire marshal.  With Spurrier's help, an artist drew a rough sketch.<br>
<br>
In January, as the fires continued, Whetsel and Litchfield asked Bonnie Spurrier to be hypnotized.  Her answers during five hours of questioning under hypnosis enabled an artist to produce a much more detailed portrait.<br>
<br>
On January 27 Whetsel and Litchfield held a press conference.  They unveiled the new portrait, released the personality profile developed by Gus Gary and emphasized the sighting in Cle Elum.  "Someone may know this person.  Come forward," Litchfield urged.<br>
<br>
At Seattle Pacific University, 21 year-old Ben Keller watched the evening news.  When the sketch of the arsonist appeared, he bolted upright with a sickening shock.  The drawings and description fit his older brother Paul.<br>
<br>
The next morning Ben Keller phoned his sister, Ruth Wacker, at their dad's ad agency.  "Pull the gasoline credit charges and see if Paul was in Cle Elum on November 17."<br>
<br>
Ruth reported that he had been.<br>
<br>
The same morning, George Keller opened the Everett Herald.  Living in the middle of the Specter's rampage, George and Margaret Keller had been as terrified as anyone.  Now George's world stopped when he saw the police sketch on the front page.  He and Margaret went over the article, underlining the arsonists traits that matched their son
Paul's.<br>
<br>
As a child Paul had been uncontrollable.  He constantly bullied his siblings.  He shoplifted.  He got in regular screaming matches with his family. And he set fires-the first at the age of nine in a vacant house on his street.<br>
<br>
Could their son be setting all those fires now? George and Mar-
garet Keller's hearts sank.<br>
<br>
When George arrived at his office, Ruth told him of Ben's call and gave him Paul's gas credit purchase- slip from Cle Elum- Keller walked -out the door and headed to the Everett Fire Department, feeling as if the world were on his shoulders.  He spilled out his fears to fire investigator Warren Burns, who rushed him to task-force headquarters to speak with Whetsel and Litchfield.<br>
<br>
"I hope with all my heart I'm wrong, but that profile fits my son<br>
Paul," Keller told the investigators.  Paul was a salesman who drove 5,000 miles a month without having to account for his whereabouts. He kept a police-fire scanner at his desk and continually monitored it.<br>
<br>
Keller described Paul's lifelong fascination with fires.  Another telling item: just before the fires began, Paul had declared personal bankruptcy.  Whetsel and Litchfield looked at each other and wordlessly agreed: He's giving us our arsonist.<br>
<br>
The men began an all-out scrutiny of Paul's life.  They knew some serial criminals make phone calls right after their crimes to release excitement.  Detectives found that Paul <B>made</B> calls on his cellular phone from the vicinity of the fires on 21 occasions, most to his own answering machine.<br>
<br>
Investigators also discovered that Paul Keller had been leading a secret life.  A canvass of bars, X-rated video shops and massage parlors revealed he was spending $1500 a month on booze, pot and   women-which explained his July 1992 bankruptcy.<br>
<br>
Still, the team had only circumstantial evidence.  "If Paul denies everything," said Whetsel, "convicting him will be difficult."<br>
But criminologists at the FBI Academy have developed subtle approaches that often induce serial criminals to confess.  So Gus Gary came to help prepare the crucial arrest and interrogation.<br>
<br>
Margaret Keller provided a list of her son's behavior patterns; she warned that he tried to lie his way out of tight spots and blame others.<br>
<br>
The team rehearsed Paul's arrest as meticulously as a  Broadway show.
On February 6, 1993, at 6:19 a.m., an Everett detective knocked on Paul's apartment door.  Soon, a convoy of police cars with the blaring sirens Paul loved carried him off at full speed.  At the front door of task-force headquarters stood the county fire chief, Rick Eastman, in full regalia.<br>
<br>
Though he'd worn it before only for funerals, Gus Gary had instructed Eastman to don it and shake Paul's <B>hand</B> <B>firmly</B>, <B>with</B> the greeting: "I know you are going to do the right thing."<br>
<br>
"Should I call my father?" Paul asked.<br>
<br>
"Your father's here," Eastman answered.  Paul Keller was then whisked down a corridor lined with enlargements of his own photo<br>
graph beside the sketches of the arsonist, now stamped "IDENTIFIED." Waiting in the interrogation room was George Keller.  He hugged his son, crying.  "It's over.  It's time to tell the truth." Later George told his son that he had turned him in.<br>
<br>
Whetsel began by playing to Paul's vanity.  "The way you set the fires and confounded the police and fire services was brilliant," he said.<br>
<br>
Paul sat back and exhaled deeply.  "I set some of the fires, but not all of them," he answered.<br>
<br>
Over the next few hours Paul Keller confessed to dozens of fires.  When the officers took him to visit the burned-out churches, homes and businesses, he bubbled with psychopathic glee as he relived the torching.<br>
<br>
In the end Paul admitted setting 76 fires amounting to $22 million in damages.<br>
<br>
Although investigators suspected he had set hundreds more, they now possessed enough evidence, including the incriminating fingerprints on the Anderson Retirement Home window, to put him on trial.<br>
<br>
One month after his arrest Paul Keller pleaded guilty to 32<br>
arson counts and admitted setting 44 additional fires.  Last May, . he was sentenced to 75 years in prison; he will not be eligible for parole until he is 77 years old.<br>

AVALANCHES.<br>
<br>
Lucille Palmer, "Rampaging snow, spring warning, " <B>Pacific Search.</B> IX (April 1975) p. 6-8.<br>
<br>
Snow is beautiful and fun.  But snow is deadly when sparkling masses abruptly plunge down slopes.  From a distance an avalanche may appear as a fluffy cloud, tumbling in powdery splendor- But it can be carrying stumps, rocks, ice chunks, and trees in its powerful embrace.  If humans in its path survive the encounter, it is only by good luck, for the odds are all in favor of the avalanche.  Even small ones can be killers.<br>
<br>
Steep slopes and snow are the only two requirements for avalanche formation, regardless of the season, and springtime brings its own set of perilous circumstances.  Spring snow is wetter than winter snow, warms very quickly, and is prone to avalanching.  A sunny day or a cloudy night increases the danger.  Slopes that appear safe - and that have been safe all winter - can become death traps in the spring.<br>
<br>
The general melting taking place in the snowpack as the weather warms increases the water content of the remaining pack, thus its weight, which makes it more likely to slip.  The meltwater seeps beneath the pack, acting as a lubricant between layers of snow, or between snow and earth or ice.  This can cause thunderous avalanches of heavy, wet snow thait sets up almost like concrete when it comes to rest.<br>
<br>
In the spring time people tend to climb around looking for new hills to ski or sled or snowshoe.  But the snow that stayed stable all winter may be dislodged by melting, the weight of a person, or even a sonic boom.  Sledders and inner-tubers often try to find a steep hill for themselves, usually adjacent to thoroughfares where maintenance crews have piled snow plowed from roads.  This is risky, for the unstable snow can slip and bury bodies even in a very short slide.  Sledding should always be done where there are lots of other people.<br>
<br>
Those who explore on glaciers should remember that a shallow and otherwise harmless slide may claim victims by sweeping them into crevasses.  There their bodies may remain entombed for years, carried along as the glacier creeps imperceptibly downhill to its own watery terminus.  The base of Mt.  Baker's Deming Glacier has been searched repeatedly for four victims of a July 1939 avalanche, when a fine layer of loose snow slid down the icy Roman Wall and enveloped 25 climbers.  Five died, and only one body was recovered.<br>
     
<br>
Although no experts can assess all the snow and terrain factors that might precipitate an avalanche, the Forest Service lists some danger signs.<br>
<br>
Snow falling at the rate of one inch per hour increases danger rapidly.  A foot or more of new snow signals danger.  Rapid changes in temperature, wind, or preeipitation cause changes within the snowpack that can lead to slides.  Winds blowing at 15 miles per hour or more create high danger by moving snow from ridges to leeward slopes, where it may bond poorly with the old crusty surface.<br>
<br>
Spring snow can be soft and "rotten," and climbers who find themselves sinking in should take another route immediately, for if this snow slips there is no way to avoid being swept along.  This is not a regular avalanche, but it keeps tumbling and burying you.<br>
<br>
Just observing the kind of snow that is falling can give a clue to its safety.  Let some flakes fall on a dark mitten or sleeve.  If 
they are small needles or <B>pel</B>lets rather than big star-shaped crystals, conditions are hazardous.  About 80% of all avalanches occur during and shortly after storms.  South-facing slopes are perilous in spring.  Scan every hill before placing yourself at its mercy.  If anything at all moves, even a snowball, move out of its path.<br>
<br>
You cannot outrun or outski an avalanche, which may reach a speed approaching 200 miles per hour.  If you go up or down a hill, don't traverse it; go straight up or down and stay high, on a ridge if possible.  If a hill must be crossed, one person at a time should go while the others watch.  There is much controversy over the use of avalanche cords, the brightly colored nylon line tied to the climber and paid out during the traverse.  A bit of the cord surely would show on top if he were buried, but some think it also might twist around him as he tumbled.  PACIFIC SEARCH will welcome firstperson accounts from survivors who have used the cords.<br>
<br>
Suppose you are caught in a sudden torrent of snow? Try not to panic.  Get rid of poles, pack, and skis.  Get away from your now lethal snowmobile.  Try to stay on top by making swimming motions.  Spit out and blow out snow that fills your mouth and nose.  As you feel the motion slowing down, stop swimming and get your hands in front of your face to make an air space.<br>
<br>
Be aware that you can move only while the avalanche is moving.  Once it stops you will probably be immobilized, so make the airspace as you are coming to a stop.  At least one survivor credits this routine with saving his life.  His two companions died.<br>
     
If you come out on top but another is buried, remember that you are his best hope for life.  Mark where you last saw him and search directly below that point.  Scuff or probe the snow with a ski pole or stick.  Do not leave and go for help unless help is only a few minutes away.  After one hour the buried person has only a 50% chance of surviving.<br>
<br>
Avalanches are complex, natural phenomena that will always be a threat.  The casualty lists can be kept short only by a well-informed public that has a profound respect for the snow's potentially deadly domination of the slopes.  For more information on avalanches and travel in the forests, send to your nearest Forest Service office for brochures or write to U.S. Forest Service, 1601 Second Avenue, Seattle, WA 98101.<br>

Train Number 27, the Great Northern's fast mail, eased to a halt at the Cascade Tunnel about 5:30 in the morning.  Mail clerk Alfred B. Hensel later remembered that he peered from his mail car and saw snow coming down "like somebody was picking a chicken." It looked to Hensel as if the snow already lay eight or nine feet deep.  Where workmen were shoveling snow o ff the roof of a nearby roundhouse, the bank they were slicing away loomed high above their heads.<br>
<br>
Ahead through the storm and on the same track with the mail train sat Number 25, a passenger train of seven cars and a big 12-wheeled locomotive.<br>
<br>
Both trains were westbound to the depots of Everett, Seattle, and Tacoma along Puget Sound.  Since leaving Spokane about three hours apart the evening before, each train had clattered across the hill country of eastern Washington and up into the Cascade Mountains.  Now they had come through Stevens Pass and were stopped just down the western slope from the summit.  Between the trains and their depots sprawled a snow slide at Windy-Point, some five miles ahead.<br>
<br>
Henry H. White, a paper salesman from Minneapolis, awoke in his sleeper berth on Number 25 after 9:00 that morning of February 23, 1910.  He discovered that the train was at the east portal of the
railroad's long Cascade Tunnel and probably would be there for awhile.  He and the other passengers trooped through the swirling snow to a railroad cook shack for breakfast.  They had no way of knowing it, but they would be eating their meals there the rest of that day and the next day as well.<br>
<br>
Thirty-eight men, nine women, and eight children were passengers on Number 25. In the group were housewives, salesmen, lawyers, ranchers, an aspiring authoress, and a sprinkling of miners, sheep-
herders, and other laborers.  They had in common a growing exasperation with the winter storm and the railroad men who could not free them from the snow.  Conductor J. L. Pettit soon began to hear their exasperation.<br>
<br>
While the' passengers fretted and grumbled, railroad men attacked the slide with rotary plows.  James H. O'Neill, superintendent of the Cascade Division, was overseeing the attempt to buck through the slide which had come down at Windy Point sometime in the night of February 22.  Each winter, O'Neill took his private rail coach into the Stevens Pass area and lived there to fight it out with the storms and snow slides.<br>
<br>
He later pointed out that in his two and a half years in charge of the Cascade Division, he had put more than 4000 trains through the mountains in snowstorms - and before February 23, 1910, none of his trains on that run had been delayed more than 24 hours.<br>
<br>
O'Neill had another run of history he was banking on as his crews slugged away at the snow slide.  The Great Northern Railway, last of the historic lines to be built all the way across the West, began service through Stevens Pass in 1893.  In the years since, railroad men had found that storms as fierce as this late-season blow were not unusual in the Cascades, but they dwindled away after a day or two, probably three at the very most.  O'Neill would explain that he thought the odds were in his favor that this dayold storm was on its way out as his men moved against the slide at Windy Point.<br>
<br>
Counting on unplugging the tracks soon and sending passengers and mail on their way to Puget Sound, ONeill ordered his crews to bring the trains through the Cascade Tunnel.  At the western portal was a triangular shelf in the mountainside where the trains could be moved off onto passing tracks parallel to the main line.  Also at the site was a hotel where the passengers could be fed, and a few railroad sheds and bunkhouses.  The little cluster of buildings was called Wellington.<br>
<br>
About 7:00 pm on February 24, the passenger train at last was dug free from the drifts that had held it for more than a day and a half and steamed through the tunnel to its siding at Wellington.  Around
II pm, the mail train followed and pulled alongside on an outside track.<br>
<br>
The two trains now stood together under a high, broad mountainside with a slope of approximattly 25 degrees.  As salesman White described it, "I don't know just how high the mountain is, but<br>
it was one of those cases where you had to throw your head back to look up to see the top of it.  It was some mountain, aH right."<br>
<br>
Some mountain, and thick with snow.  "It had the appearance simply of a big, immense blanket of snow," White said.  "The mountainside was a very beauful sight.  The snow had fallen so long, and so much of it, that it hod covered up all the blemishes or disfigurements, and it was just a big, solid mass of pure white snow.  It was a sight that you could not pass without being attracted to; you would have to look at it."<br>
<br>
The passengers did look at it and were uneasy.  But bringing the trains through the tunnel was the first real movement in almost two days, and the optimistic could take heart from that.<br>
<br>
Then one of O'Neill's rotary plows broke down when it hit a stump in the snow slide covering the tracks at Windy Point.  The disabled plow had to be brought back to Wellington and another sent out.  When the replacement plow reached Windy Pointi a fresh avalanche lay across its path.<br>
<br>
And the storm was refusing to die.  Not that night, nor the next morning.  ONeill's plow butted into the slide all day of February 25.  Progress was slow, both because of the depth of the snow and because the plow had to retum to Wellington to fill its boiler with water every four hours or so.<br>
<br>
The passengers, now in their third day on the mountain, grew edgier.  Several demanded that something be done with train Number 25 - back it into the Cascade Tunnel, do anything to move it from beneath the snow field on the slope above.<br>
<br>
Their anxiety sharpened when they heard that the night before an avalanche had swept away the cook shack where they had eaten their meals at the eastem entrance to the tunnel.  The cook and his helper were dead.  The passengers realized that had not the trains been brought through to the west end of the tunnel, some of them might be beneath last night's avalanche also.<br>
<br>
The railroad men refused to move the trains.  They pointed out that if Number 25 was backed into the tunnel and the locomotive kept under steam to heat the coaches, there would be danger of smoke
suffocation.  From Superintendent O'Neill on down, the Great Northern men then and later maintained that they believed the train was in the safest spot on the mountainside.  No one could recall a slide precasely there in all the winters the Great Northern trains had been bulling through the Stevens Pass route.<br>
<br>
Around 3:00 am on February 26, the weary rotary crew finally punched through the slide.  O'Neill and his men returned to Wellington for the trains.<br>
<br>
After refueling, the rotary lumbered back down the tracks to make sure the line was clear beyond where they had conquered the Windy Point snow mass.  Passengers and train men at Wellington waited to hear when the trains could start down the mountain behind the plow.<br>
<br>
Near noon, the rotary came back.  The track at Windy Point was clogged again with yet another avalanche.  The rotary again took on coal and water, and O'Neill led his crew back to the latest slide.  They chewed into the packed snow with the rotary until late afternoon.  Then the plow once more headed back toward Wellington for refueling.  Before long, it stopped.  Ahead sprawled still another avalanche.<br>
<br>
Now the plow was bottled, an avalanche on either side, without the coal needed to fight its way out.  ONefll slogged into Wellington to call for help.  There he found that the telegraph line had gone dead.<br>
<br>
Twice in the past four days, the railroad men had broken through the snow and debris heaped on the tracks at Windy Point.  But against their expectations, ifeither the storm nor the slides would let up.  The plows were out of commission and the telegraph useless.  And there still was a train in the snowdrifts at WeUington with 55 pa&sengers aboard.<br>
<br>
The next morning, February 27, O'Neill and two brakeman started for Scenic, the next section point on the fine, to send for more plows and men.  "We waded in snow up to our waists, and changed off breaking trail," O'Neill recalled.  The trio fought their way the four miles through the drifts, and O'Neill telegraphed for two plows and 300 workmen.<br>
<br>
Five male passengers decided to walk the four miles to Scenic as the superintendent and his men had.  They made it in an exhausting, bruising effort.  By now, railway laborers were walking out, too -
turning in their shovels in a wage dispute and slogging away from Wellington with their bedrolls on their backs.  Others stayed on, fighting the snow by day and sleeping at night wherever there was available space on the passenger train.<br>
     
That afternoon, passenger John Rogers witnessed an avalanche on one of the nearby mountains.  The white slope rushed down as if instantly molten, snapping off trees and roaring onto the valley floor below.<br>
<br>
The next morning, the 28th, Rogers set out on foot for Scenic with six other male passengers who preferred the risk of the hike to staying with the stalled train.  Conductor Pettit, wanting to ar-
range for supplies to be packed in, took three railroad men and started out with the determined passengers.  All made it except Pettit, who turned back.<br>
<br>
The passengers remaining on the train harassed any available railroad official with demands that their train be backed into the Cascade Tunnel.  The Great Northern men stood fast.  They repeated that there never had been an avalanche where the train now stood.  Clear of the guiches which chuted avalanches down the slopes and preferable to the discomfort and possible danger the tunnel would hold, the side tracks at Wellington still seemed to veteran railroaders the safest site.<br>
<br>
After a wrangle with trainmaster Arthur R. Blackburn the night of February 28, passengers turned in for another tense night.  Several, including some of the younger women, resolved to try to walk out through the snowdrifts in the morning.  Train Number 25, beneath the cold snow cap of Windy Mountain a long warm burrow filled with nervous passengers and tired railroad laborers, was in its sixth night on the mountain.<br>
<br>
In the night, the falling snow changed to rain, and a lightning storm crackled through the Cascades.  Near 1:30 am on March 1, about 500 feet above the trains the snow mass slipped loose along a line as neat as if snipped by giant shears.<br>
<br>
More than a quarter of a mile wide, the avalanche surged down the slope.  The acres of snow roared over the Wellington siding gathering everything in the path.  Both trains instantly were swept sideways over the mountain ledge on the crest of the slide; then the vast bulk of the following snow buried them.<br>
<br>
The noise of moving snow ended.  Under the avalanche at the bottom of the slope were the passenger train, the fast mail, Superintendent O'Neill's private car, a rotary plow, some boxcars and electric engines, and more than 100 persons.<br>
<br>
Henry White, asleep in a berth nearest the mountain slope, recalled
that he was awakened "by the impact of the snow against the side of the coach and the sound of breaking glass."<br>
<br>
Mail clerk Alfred Hensel, asleep in the mail train between the passenger train and the drop-off to Tye Creek a few hundred feet below, remembered:<br>
<br>
"When I came to, I found that I was pinned down with a timber or something over me in such shape that it was impossible for me to move any more than my head.  After some difficulty I worked myself out of there, and I did get out on the top of the snow, and at that time all I could see, or the first thing I saw, was the lights up at Wellington, which kind of puzzled me, as before they were on prac-
tically a level with us, where the trains were, and at this time they were up the mountain......<br>
<br>
The railroad workers lucky enough to have been in the bunkhouse at Wellington instead of sleeping on the train descended into the ravine and started digging.  A section man hiked to Scenic and told O'Neill.  O'Neill sent a message to the Great Northern office in Everett for a relief train and dispatched 50 men to hike up to the disaster scene.<br>
<br>
They were the first contingent of a small army that would make the hard trip between Scenic and Wellington in the next several days.<br>
<br>
Shovelers toiled into the mass of snow, wreckage, and tangled trees.  Some avalanche victims quickly were found alive, including a woman deep in the snow beneath a large tree.  A fortunate few had been spilled onto the top of the slide when the impact broke open their railroad coach.  But mostly the searchers found bodies, more and more bodies.<br>
<br>
Doctors and nurses hiked in and set up a field ho@spital in a shed at Wellington.  Corpses were sledded out to Scenic.  For eight days after the avalanche, the work was grim, slow, and entirely manual.  The tracks were not opened until March 9, when a rotary plow broke through from the east.<br>
<br>
By then, the statistics of the slide at Wellington were known.  Of those who had been on the trapped trains the early morning of March 1, only 22 survived.  The official toll of passengers and workmen, when the avalanche at last had been sifted by the shovelers, was 96 dead.<br>
<br>
And finally, on March 12, the route to the west was forced open with blasting powder - 18 days after Superintendent O'Neill first sent a plow into the snow at Windy Point.<br>

Around 3:00 am on February 26, the weary rotary crew finally punched through the slide.  O'Neill and his men returned to Wellington for the trains.<br>
<br>
After refueling, the rotary lumbered back down the tracks to make sure the line was clear beyond where they had conquered the Windy Point snow mass.  Passengers and train men at Wellington waited to hear when the trains could start down the mountain behind the plow.<br>
<br>
Near noon, the rotary came back.  The track at Windy Point was clogged again with yet another avalanche.  The rotary again took on coal and water, and O'Neill led his crew back to the latest slide.  They chewed into the packed snow with the rotary until late afternoon.  Then the plow once more headed back toward Wellington
for refueling.  Before long, it stopped.  Ahead sprawled still another avalanche.<br>
<br>
Now the plow was bottled, an avalanche on either side, without the coal needed to fight its way out.  O'Neill slogged into Wellington to call for help.  There he found that the telegraph line had gone dead.<br>
<br>
Twice in the past four days, the railroad men had broken through the snow and debris heaped on the tracks at Windy Point.  But against their expectations, if either the storm nor the slides would let up.  The plows were out of commission and the telegraph useless.  And there still was a train in the snowdrifts at WeUing-
ton with 55 pa&sengers aboard.<br>
<br>
The next morning, February 27, O'Neill and two brakeman started for Scenic, the next section point on the fine, to send for more plows and men.  "We waded in snow up to our waists, and changed off breaking trail," O'Neill recalled.  The trio fought their way the four miles through the drifts, and O'Neill telegraphed for two plows and 300 workmen.<br>
<br>
Five male passengers decided to walk the four miles to Scenic as the superintendent and his men had.  They made it in an exhausting, bruising effort.  By now, railway laborers were walking out, too -
turning in their shovels in a wage dispute and slogging away from Wellington with their bedrolls on their backs.  Others stayed on, fighting the snow by day and sleeping at night wherever there was available space on the passenger train.<br>
<br>
That afternoon, passenger John Rogers witnessed an avalanche on one of the nearby mountains.  The white slope rushed down as if instantly molten, snapping off trees and roaring onto the valley floor below.<br>
<br>
The next morning, the 28th, Rogers set out on foot for Scenic with six other male passengers who preferred the risk of the hike to staying with the stalled train.  Conductor Pettit, wanting to ar-
range for supplies to be packed in, took three railroad men and started out with the determined passengers.  All made it except Pettit, who turned back.<br>
<br>
The passengers remaining on the train harassed any available railroad official with demands that their train be backed into the Cascade Tunnel.  The Great Northern men stood fast.  They repeated that there never had been an avalanche where the train now stood.  Clear of the guiches which chuted avalanches down the slopes and preferable to the discomfort and possible danger the tunnel would hold, the side tracks at Wellington still seemed to veteran railroaders the safest site.<br>
<br>
After a wrangle with trainmaster Arthur R. Blackburn the night of February 28, passengers turned in for another tense night.  Several, including some of the younger women, resolved to try to
walk out through the snowdrifts in the morning.  Train Number 25, beneath the cold snow cap of Windy Mountain a long warm burrow filled with nervous passengers and tired railroad laborers, was in its sixth night on the mountain.<br>
<br>
In the night, the falling snow changed to rain, and a lightning storm crackled through the Cascades.  Near 1:30 am on March 1, about 500 feet above the trains the snow mass slipped loose along a line as neat as if snipped by giant shears.<br>
<br>
More than a quarter of a mile wide, the avalanche surged down the slope.  The acres of snow roared over the Wellington siding gathering everything in the path.  Both trains instantly were swept sideways over the mountain ledge on the crest of the slide; then the vast bulk of the following snow buried them.<br>
<br>
The noise of moving snow ended.  Under the avalanche at the bottom of the slope were the passenger train, the fast mail, Superintendent O'Neill's private car, a rotary plow, some boxcars and electric engines, and more than 100 persons.<br>
<br>
Henry White, asleep in a berth nearest the mountain slope, recalled that he was awakened "by the impact of the snow against the side of the coach and the sound of breaking glass."<br>
<br>
Mail clerk Alfred Hensel, asleep in the mail train between the passenger train and the drop-off to Tye Creek a few hundred feet below, remembered:<br>
<br>
"When I came to, I found that I was pinned down with a timber or something over me in such shape that it was impossible for me to move any more than my head.  After some difficulty I worked myself out of there, and I did get out on the top of the snow, and at that time all I could see, or the first thing I saw, was the lights up at Wellington, which kind of puzzled me, as before they were on practically a level with us, where the trains were, and at this time they were up the mountain......<br>
<br>
The railroad workers lucky enough to have been in the bunkhouse at Wellington instead of sleeping on the train descended into the ravine and started digging.  A section man hiked to Scenic and told O'Neill.  O'Neill sent a message to the Great Northern office in Everett for a relief train and dispatched 50 men to hike up to the disaster scene.<br>
<br>
They were the first contingent of a small army that would make the hard trip between Scenic and Wellington in the next several days.<br>
<br>
Shovelers toiled into the mass of snow, wreckage, and tangled trees.  Some avalanche victims quickly were found alive, including a woman deep in the snow beneath a large tree.  A fortunate few had been spilled onto the top of the slide when the impact broke open
their railroad coach.  But mostly the searchers found bodies, more and more bodies.<br>
<br>
Doctors and nurses hiked in and set up a field hospital in a shed at Wellington.  Corpses were sledded out to Scenic.  For eight days after the avalanche, the work was grim, slow, and entirely manual.  The tracks were not opened until March 9, when a rotary plow broke through from the east.<br>
<br>
By then, the statistics of the slide at Wellington were known.  Of those who had been on the trapped trains the early morning of March 1, only 22 survived.  The official toll of passengers and workmen, when the avalanche at last had been sifted by the shovelers, was 96 dead.<br>
<br>
And finally, on March 12, the route to the west was forced open with blasting powder - 18 days after Superintendent O'Neill first sent a plow into the snow at Windy Point.<br>

WELLINGTON WRECK.<br>
<br>
Edgar I.Stewart, "The famous Wellington wreck," <B>Washington Northwest Frontier.</B> New York: Lewis Historical Publishing Company, 1957. Volume II, p. 204-206.<br>
<br>
On March 1, 1910, occurred the famous Wellington wreck one of tile most spectacular railroad disasters in the history of the state, and for that matter probably in the history of the United States.<br>
<br>
On the twenty second of February two Great Northern trains, Numbers 25 and 27, the Fast Mail and the Spokane Express, the latter a local running between Spokane and Seattle, left Spokane several hours behind schedule.<br>
<br>
They proceeded as far as the town of Leavenworth where they were held for ten hours and then allowed to go on.  This time they managed to get as far as the Cascade Tunnel at the summit of Steven's Pass, which was reached on the twenty-fifth.<br>
<br>
Here they were held for two days and nights, and on the twenty-seventh were allowed to go through the tunnel to a point about four hundred yards beyond the station at Wellington, which was located at the west end of the tunnel, and where it was believed that they would be perfectly safe.<br>
<br>
Here they were stopped because of trouble in the famous Horseshoe Tunnel which was just ahead.  Here a snowplow had become disabled
in attempting to clear away some of the debris from previous slides which had not only blocked the line but had destroyed a considerable section of the track as well.<br>
<br>
At Wellington there were three banks, or rows, of tracks; the top or inside track and the one nearest to the mountain side being occupied by four locomotives and Superintendent's O'Neil's private car; on the middle track was the passenger local, with a sleeping car, two coaches, a diner, mail car and baggage car, while on the outside track and at the brink of the cliff were the four mail cars of the Fast Mail.<br>
<br>
A great deal of snow and ice had accumulated during ten days of the worst blizzard the state had ever experienced.  At times it had snowed at the rate of a foot per hour by actual measurement, and in the opinion of old timers of the region there had never been as much snow in the mountains before.<br>
<br>
Both passengers and railway officials were aware of the danger from slides, and it had been suggested that the passenger train should be backed into the tunnel for safety, but officials expressed the belief that it was as safe where it was as anywhere,,and that in the tunnel there was the danger that it might be blocked by further slides.<br>
<br>
Then a slide occurred behind the trains, and between them and the tunnel so that they could move neither backward nor forward.  But 
<B>in </B>the meantime arrangements had been made to take the passengers to a place of safety.  They were to be taken by trail one thousand feet down the mountainside to Scenic Hot Springs which was as far up the west side of the Cascades as trains could go.<br>
<br>
Experienced mountain guides had been sent to Wellington to aid in getting the marooned passengers out, and two parties were taken out on the afternoon of the twenty-eighth.  The beleaguered occupants of the trains  had been eating two meals a day, since food supplies were running low, that the railroad boarding house at Wellington, and then returning to the cars to sleep.<br>
<br>
On the night of the twenty-eighth of February, a terrific windstorm arose, accompanied by that rare winter phenomenon, a thunder and lightning storm, a pyrotechnic display that was characterized by the survivors as a grand and awful spectacle of the forces of nature.<br>
<br>
The temperature was rising, and a great mass of snow and ice, possibly jarred loose by a stroke of lightning, swept down the mountainside at a quarter to two on the morning of the first of March.<br>
<br>
This avalanche, which was over a mile in width, reaching from Well-
ington to a point beyond the first snow-shed, was about forty feet deep and swept all three trains off the narrow ledge on which the tracks had been built, hurling them like toys to the bottom of the
canyon some two hundred feet below.<br>
<br>
In addition, three locomotives, four large electric motors which were used to haul the trains through the tunnel, the depot at Wellington, the electric power plant, and a water-tank were swept down into the gorge, while the railroad boarding house was badly damaged.<br>
<br>
The wrecked trains were piled on top of one another in the canyon and the wooden cars smashed to kindling wood.  The snow, over forty feet deep, was packed like cement so that many of the bodies were crushed, some of them beyond recognition.  The gorge was literally packed tight with snow, ice, trees, and boulders of enormous size and weight.<br>
<br>
The snow and ice also covered the ledge on which the trains had stood and buried the wreckage so completely that it was six hours before the rescue parties succeeded in locating it.  Rescue work was also hampered by the fact that the wrecking and rescue trains could not get beyond Scenic Hot Springs, and from there the workers had to make their way over a steep and dangerous mountain trail to the scene of the disaster.<br>
<br>
The task, of rescue was also hampered by the presence of the inevitable curiosity seekers who always flock to the scene of any great disaster and seriously impede the progress of what is at best a difficult job.  But in this case they were effectively checked after the first few days by the threat of being put to work if they remained.<br>
<br>
The work of rescue went ahead steadily and courageously although 
the rescuers knew that they worked <B>in </B>constant peril of their lives since the threat of further slides could not be ignored.<br>
<br>
The loss of life in this wreck has never been accurately determined.  Although generally set at ninety-eight, it was probably greater.  Weeks were required to rescue all of the bodies, one in fact was not found until the following June.<br>
<br>
At the bottom of the gorge was a small stream, frozen over at the time of the wreck, but as the spring advanced and the snow and ice melted, became almost a raging torrent at times so that several bodies may have been swept down-stream and never recovered.<br>
<br>
Among the dead were R. M. Barnhart, a former prosecuting attorney of Spokane County, Charles S. Eltinge, a well-known figure in state financial circles, and J. Brackman, the owner of a large wheat ranch, who was taking his first train ride in more than forty years.<br>
<br>
Nor has the cost in money ever been determined, but it certainly ran well into the millions of dollars and in addition a great deal of United States mail was either lost or destroyed.<br>
     
In order to blot out as far as possible all memory of the wreck, the Great Northern Railway changed the name of the station from Wellington to Tye.  More important the wreck revived the idea of constructing a tunnel at a lower level with the western portal at Scenic, and the eastern at Berne, thus eliminating several miles of dangerous trackage, including the famous Horseshoe Tunnel which had been counted such a great engineering achievement when it was originally constructed.<br>
<br>
The idea of a lower tunnel, which had been under consideration for a number of years, had been pronounced feasible by both American and European engineers, but its construction was delayed by the outbreak of World War One, and not brought to a successful conclusion until the decade of the twenties.<br>

People Who Know About Wellington<br>
<br>
There are a great number of people in Washington State who know about Wellington.  Many are willing to discuss Wellington with interested people.  In doing this research the author has met many wonderful people who are interested in sharing information.<br>
<br>
Several individual projects are underway that will increase the awareness of Wellington.  The Iron Goat Trail will reach Wellington in 1999.  If you have a specific interest in Wellington please contact the author for a appropriate referral.<br>
<br>
People Who Were at Wellington<br>
<br>
Many people tell stories about a relative or friend who had a relative or friend at Wellington at the time of the avalanche.  These stories can get very confusing and it becomes hard to understand who was involved at Wellington on March 1, 1910.<br>
<br>
The author has created a Wellington Who's Who with over 350 citations.  The document was developed from peoples names being cited in various publications.  These documents include court records, books, telegrams, letters, cemetery records etc.  Each time a person was mentioned a entry was made in the database.<br>
<br>
If a person was cited more than one time they are entered each
time they were cited.  Various spellings may have been used and the spellings and other inconsistencies have not yet been resolved.<br>
<br>
Copies of the database are available from the author.<br>
<br>
Telegrams<br>
<br>
There are a number of telegrams about the event in collections.<br>
The majority are held by individuals.<br>
<br>
The telegrams deal with the conditions prior to the event, the announcement of the event, requests for aid and status of the rescue effort.  Most of the telegrams immediately after the event are in code.  Many of the copies available are in poor condition and hard to read.  A list of 50 telegrams, documented by a group of historians, is available from the author.<br>
<br>
Telegram Codes<br>
<br>
Starting on March 1, 1910 many of the telegrams issued by the<br>
Great Northern are in code.<br>
<br>
Telegram Example:<br>
<br>
Code:<br>
<br>
"...the Sagittateary and taints prophesised causes were up on the<br>
comfit turf ..."<br>
<br>
De-coded:<br>
<br>
"...  the rotary and the superintendents private car were up on the coal track ..."<br>

Wellington<br>
<br>
The site of Wellington (later Tye) is accessible by a county road and a short walk.  There are only two structures remaining that were in place at the time of the disaster.  The west portal of the old Cascade tunnel and the concrete bridge wing walls for Haskell creeks access under the mainline to Tye creek.<br>
<br>
A small concrete block structure is located at the point of the old Haskell creek bridge. (This structure is used to mount cannons for winter avalanche control on Highway 2 above the valley.) The county road to the site follows some of the old switch back route.<br>

<br>
EVERETT, March 1. - Twenty-three are known to be dead, 25 are missing and a score are injured as a result of the avalanche that swept down the mountain side above Wellington, at the west side of the Cascade tunnel, early this morning and crushed two Great Northern trains, one the west bound Spokane Express and the other an overload mail train, off the narrow ledge of the high line, hurling them to the bottom of the canyon, 200 feet below.<br>
<br>
Coupled to the Spokane Express was Superintendent J. H. O'Neill's private car.  This was carried over the precipice with the rest of the train.  Three locomotives, four powerful electric motors used to haul trains through the Cascade tunnel, the depot at Wellington and a water tank were also carried away by the slide and buried under tons of debris.<br>
<br>
Cries of Distress Heard.<br>
<br>
Seventy people were aboard the Spokane Express when the slide struck it.  Forty of these were passengers who were sleeping in the Pullmans.  The others were workmen who had been engaged in a battle against the snow blockade and who were using the day coaches for bunk cars.<br>
<br>
The last report received tonight from Scenic says that the rescuers are still struggling with ice and snow endeavoring to release the imprisoned passengers and recover the remaining dead.  Reports that shouts and cries for help have been heard coming from the mass of wreckage give rise to the hope that many of those imprisoned are still alive.<br>
<br>
Several undertakers left for Scenic tonight.  It will be necessary to embalm the bodies, as the snow blockades between Wellington and Everett have shut off all traffic except by foot.  If the bodies are brought out soon they will have to be transported on sledges.<br>
<br>
EVERETT, March 1. - The snowslide at Wellington is authentically reported to the Great Northern officials to be about one mile in width, reaching from the water tower south of Wellington to the first snowshed fully a mile distant, past the four sidings that are capable of holding 70 cars each.<br>
<br>
The equipment carried down the steep slope is the rotary plow, with its crew, all of whom sleep in the rotary's bunkhouse.
All communication with Wellington was cut off in the first slide last Thursday and since then the Great Northern wires have been working only as far as Skykomish and there the messages are transferred by telephone to the first siding south of Scenic, the nearest approach to the scene of the disaster.  No report that Wellington was swept away is substantiated.  The depot is still there which is believed to mean the town is safe.<br>
<br>
Most of the dead are believed to have been passengers on the westbound Spokane express, which has been stalled in the mountains since February 24.  The other train was a fast transcontinental mail.  It carried no passengers.<br>
<br>
The names of the passengers on the stalled train are not known here and wire trouble in the mountains has interrupted communication with the scene of the disaster.  The two trains were in charge of Conductors Parzybock and Petit, both of Everett.  The fate of the train crews is not known.<br>
<br>
It is feared that A. E. Longcoy, Superintendent O'Neill's private secretary, is among the dead.  He was in the private car which was buried and the messages received here make no mention of his escape.  Superintendent O'Neill, who has been directing the work of fighting the snow blockade for the last 10 days, was not in the car when the slide occurred and escaped injury.<br>
<br>
Victims Were Asleep.<br>
<br>
The avalanche swept down the mountainside shortly after 4 o'clock this morning.  It was half a mile long and the snow, loose stones and uprooted trees were piled several feet deep.  Most of the passengers on the train were asleep and received no warning of the danger.<br>
<br>
The trains and locomotives were completely buried by the debris from the mountainside and it was six hours after the avalanche before the rescue parties made up from workers sent to attack the snowdrifts, located them.  Willing hands at once proceeded to the task of rescuing the living and removing the bodies of the dead.<br>
<br>
An appeal was sent at once to Everett for help and a trainload of physicians and rescuers was started for the scene.  Owing to previous slides which have blocked the line and carried out sections of track the rescue train can go only as far as Scenic.<br>
<br>
Wellington is at the west portal of the Cascade tunnel and is 1,000 feet above Scenic and almost directly over the little resort.  If the rescuers follow the tortuous windings of the railroad as it climbs the mountain they will have to walk 10 miles but by taking a mountain trail they can cut this distance to three miles.  A second rescue train containing a wrecking outfit and additional workers and undertakers, left Everett at 8 o'clock tonight.<br>

Power House Reported Gone.<br>
<br>
Reports received here tonight say that the Great Northern's power house, which furnishes electric power to operate trains through the Cascade tunnel, the depot and the water tank were swept away by the avalanche, and that the railroad boarding house was badly wrecked.  A number of the dead and injured are railroad men and residents of Wellington.<br>
<br>
The Spokane express has been stalled at Wellington since last Thursday.  The passengers have been eating at the railroad boarding house and at nearby cottages, but have returned to the Pullmans to spend the night.  Two days ago several of the passengers, fearing a catastrophe of this kind, asked Superintendent O'Neill to have the train moved back into the Cascade tunnel where it would be protected.  Mr. O'Neill is said to have declared that the train was perfectly safe on the siding at Wellington and decided to leave it there.<br>
<br>
Reports as to the number of passengers marooned on the train vary.  The railroad company claims that there were only 30 people on the train, but men who tired of the delay and walked out over the snow to Skykomish where they could get a train, say that there were more than 60 people on board.<br>
<br>
Dead and Injured.<br>
<br>
Communication with Scenic, the nearest point to the scene of the disaster, was established late tonight and the names of a few of the dead and injured were received.  Those reported dead are:<br>
<br>
TRAINMASTER A. L. BLACKBURN, Everett, Wash.<br>
<br>
A. C. LONGCOY, secretary to Superintendent O'Neill, Everett, Wash.<br>
<br>
LEWIS WALTER, Everett.<br>
<br>
Seriously injured:<br>
<br>
Fireman J. D. Kurdee.<br>
<br>
Slightly injured:<br>
<br>
Engineer Osborne, F. S. Martin, Caroll Jergensen and D. E. Tegtmier of Everett; Fireman Gillmen, Bennington, Jinks, Meuk, E. A. Bates and Fred Nelson, Conductor M. A. White, Brakeman Ross, Mail Clerk A. H. Hurdsell, Porters A. Smith and L. Anderson and Trainmaster W. Harrington.<br>
<br>
Messages from the rescuers at work have to be carried on foot from Wellington to Scenic and are brief.  None of the passengers had been identified when the last message was received there and their names are not known.  From reports received at the Great Northern office here it is evident that the greatest loss of life was among
the passengers on the Spokane local.<br>
<br>
Trains Piled on Each Other.<br>
<br>
The wrecked trains lie piled on top of each other 200 feet below the siding upon which they stood when the avalanche swept over them.  The cars were crushed into kindling wood and no one on the trains escaped injury.  The slide filled the shelf upon which the track at Wellington are laid and rolled over the edge on down the mountainside into the valley below.<br>
<br>
The danger from slides is not over.  Warm weather in the mountains is melting snow and frequently an avalanche is heard thundering down the mountains.  Not far from the scene of the disaster a slide four miles long rushed down into the canyon this afternoon.  The snow is 18 feet deep on the level and in the canyons it is piled up in drifts more than fifty feet deep.<br>
<br>
E. A. Sherber, East 616 Erminas Street, Spokane, one of the passengers of the ill-fated train left Wellington yesterday noon and walked to Skykomish, arrived in Everett tonight.  He reports that 54 passengers remained with the train when his party left.<br>
<br>
Among those on the train were John Mackle, Moyie, B. C.; Alec Chisholm, Rossland, B. C.; G. Heron, Vancouver, B. C.; Mrs. William Starrett and three children, Victoria B. C.; Mr. and Mrs. William May, Chemanius, B. C.; Mr. and Mrs. G. L. Beck and three children, Pleasanton, Cal,; Rev. A. Thompson, Bellingham, Wash., and Mr. Davis and child, Seattle.<br>
<br>

SPOKANE, March 1. - The following mail clerks were on train No. 27:<br>
<br>
John D. Fox, Seattle, married; Richard C. Bogart, Spokane, single; George Hoefer, Spokane, married; John C. Tucker, Spokane, married; Alfred B. Hensel, Spokane, single; Lee J. Ahern, Spokane, single.<br>

<br>
PASSENGERS TO BLAME FOR TAKING TRAIN OUT TUNNEL<br>
<br>
Feared The Landslide Would Block Opening and They Would Be Suffocated--Three Survivors Reach Everett and Tell Graphic Story of Their Experiences<br>
<br>
SPOKANE, March 2. -- It is rumored in Spokane's that a second avalanche, at Scenic Pass, covered the rescuers engaged in taking out bodies, thus causing further loss of life.  The rumor, though persistent, cannot be verified.<br>
<br>
(SPECIAL TO THE LEDGER)<br>
<br>
EVERETT, Wash., March 2. - Eighty-four dead is the largest conservative estimate of the loss of life in the slide at Wellington.  Nineteen injured are in a sheltered bunk house at Wellington.  All except one woman are expected to fully recover, but it may be two weeks before it is safe to move them.<br>
<br>
Drs. Cox, Chisholm and Howard returned tonight with two survivors of the wreck.  These were firemen, F. A. Bates, who went down the gulch in his cab, and Matt Gilmore, who went over with a rotary.<br>
<br>
According to Bates, the slide occurred at 1:40 a.m.  The avalanche was preceded by a thunder storm.  When the snow engulfed the train the mass moved almost noiselessly and could scarcely be heard 50 feet distant.<br>
<br>
All available figures show that not less then 105 people were involved in the tragedy.  As part of Wellington was destroyed there may have been more.<br>
<br>
Gangs of men are still at work recovering the dead.  It is perilous work for the relief party, as further slides seem likely to occur in many places.  There is still much snow above
Wellington, but the bunk house where the injured are is considered out of danger.<br>
<br>
Among the first people into Wellington the morning of this disaster were two nurses, one Mrs. Garvan of Everett.  These women, dressed in men's clothing, climbed 1,200 feet up the slope, risking their lives at every step.<br>
<br>
EVERETT, March 2. - The Great Northern railroad tonight gave out a list of the known dead, missing and rescued in the avalanche at Wellington, from which it appears possible that the total number of dead may reach 84.  Eight passengers and nine railroad employees are known to be dead and 38 passengers and 29 railroad employees are missing.<br>
<br>
A comprehensive story of the extent of the disaster and the circumstances attending it has not yet been obtained.  Several men have arrived at Scenic Hot Springs from Wellington, but they were hysterical from the horror of the avalanche and the perils of their descent of the mountain and were unable to describe the scene at the summit and the work of recovering the bodies of the dead.<br>
<br>
While some of the missing may be found alive, the fate of the majority, railroad men believe, has been death.  Many of the missing are laborers who were at work trying to clear the track.  All the injured are being cared for at Wellington, owing to the difficulty in getting them 12 miles down the slide-swept slope to a point where trains can reach them.  The rescue party that left here on last night's special did not reach Wellington until noon today.<br>
<br>
Feared to Stay in Tunnel.<br>
<br>
While there is no official information on the point, it is understood at the local offices that train No. 25 was not kept in the tunnel because of the pleas of passengers who feared being blockaded there with the resulting risk of suffocation.  The passenger coaches are still completely buried.  The day coach and smoker have entirely disappeared, being literally smashed to bits.  One woman was rescued from the Pullman after 12 hours imprisonment.<br>
<br>
Brakeman Duncan and Conductors Purcell and Clary, who were in a car that was reduced to splinters, escaped with slight bruises and in bare feet did heroic rescue work.<br>
<br>
The physicians who accompanied the relief trains report that all the injured are doing well and it is believed all will recover.  There are plenty of people to take care of those needing assistance and an abundance of provisions.  Rotaries are working from both directions, making good progress and doing everything possible to clear the track.<br>

Survivors Reach Everett.<br>
<br>
The first news direct from the scene of the disaster was received here tonight when Dr. Cox, one of the Great Northern physicians, who went up on the first relief train, returned from Wellington, accompanied by three of the survivors, Ray Forsyth, R. M. Lavelle and Firemen S. A. Bates.  Dr. Cox says that none of the injured is in a critical condition.  Many of the injured were only slightly hurt.  When the party left Wellington 16 were in the hospital in charge of Dr. Rockwell.<br>
<br>
Forsyth and Bates estimate that not more than 20 of the 110 people who were carried into the canyon by the avalanche escaped serious injury.  Eleven passenger cars, three locomotives, four electric motors, one rotary snow plow, the rotary shed and the sand house were swept away by the slide.<br>
<br>
A member of the first relief party who returned to Everett tonight said that when he reached the scene all the cars were completely buried.  Much of the wreckage was covered by 40 feet of snow, and all that could be seen was one partly buried electric motor, two locomotives and the wreckage of the rotary.  All that could be seen of the coaches was a steel pipe sticking out of the snow where a Pullman car was twisted around a stump, and a curtain that lay on top.<br>
<br>
Fearful Storm Raged.<br>
<br>
Ray Forsyth, one of the injured passengers, was in a car in which there were five women and seven children.  Three women and two children escaped, but the others undoubtedly perished.  In telling of the experience Forsyth said that it seemed as if the car was lifted bodily from the tracks and was held poised in mid air.  Suddenly, it toppled over the edge and rolled down the steep embankment.  Instantly the air was filled with the shrieks of the injured.  A fearful storm was raging.  A high wind was blowing and there was a spectacular electrical display.  The first men to extricate themselves from the mass of wreckage set to work at releasing those less fortunate.  They had no lights and carried on their work by the flare of the lightning, which was almost incessant.<br>
<br>
This morning the severed hand of a woman was found.  On a finger was a ring bearing initials which lead the workers to believe that it belonged to Miss Katherine O'Reilly of Spokane, who is listed among the missing.  Men returning from the scene of the disaster hold little hope that any of the missing will be recovered alive.  This tends to strengthen the estimate that the total number of dead will ultimately reach 84.<br>
<br>
Buried Six Hours<br>
<br>
Fireman S. A. Bates, one of the injured, was buried under snow six hours.  Other survivors heard his shouts and dug him out before
the first party of rescuers arrived.<br>
<br>
Trainmaster A. R. Blackburn, who was sleeping in Supt. O'Neill's private car, was taken out of the wreckage alive.  His only words were "Look out for the others."  Then he lapsed into unconsciousness.<br>
<br>
Station Agent Flannery of Wellington dug Blackburn out of the snow and started to carry him to a place of safety.  A small slide struck them and Flannery was knocked down.  Blackburn's body slipped from his grasp and was carried into a small stream, where it disappeared from sight.<br>
<br>
Latest reports indicate that the avalanche swept down the mountain above Wellington at 1:45 a.m. instead of at 4:30.<br>
<br>
This is the statement of the survivors and it is borne out by the finding of watches stopped at that hour.<br>
<br>
Car Tossed About Like Feather<br>
<br>
Ira Clary and H. Purcell, conductors on the rotary plows, give vivid accounts of their experiences.  They were asleep in one of the vacant mail cars which were swept off the ledge, but escaped without serious injury.<br>
<br>
"I thought the end of the world had come," said Clary, in describing his experiences.  "The car in which I was asleep appeared to be picked up and tossed about like a feather.  Then it began to roll over and tumbled down the mountain side.  Suddenly it hit a big tree which stood in our path and the car popped open like an egg shell.  When I came to my senses I found myself buried under six feet of snow.  I was clear of the wreckage and was able to dig myself out.<br>
<br>
"I heard Purcell calling and hurried to his assistance.  I dug him out and then we started to get out the others.  We got out several who were unhurt and did what we could to assist those pinned beneath the wreckage."<br>
<br>
According to the story of the trainmen who survived the disaster, the place where the trains were standing at Wellington was believed to be the safest on that part of the line.  In former years no snowslide had ever reached that place and it was selected for that reason.<br>

Forty Eight Bodies Recovered at Wellington - Some of Cars Are Under 70 Feet of Ice, Trees and Rocks.<br>
<br>
OLYMPIA, March 4. - (Special) - Governor Hay will call for volunteers to go to Wellington to aid in the rescue of the entombed victims of the avalanche who lie buried in the wreckage of the two Great Northern trains.  Senator A. J. Falconer of Everett telephoned Gov. Hay today that the Great Northern railway officials are unable to get men to go to work at the scene of the disaster, and that only 30 men are now engaged in the rescue.<br>
<br>
On the receipt of this message the governor telephoned the chief dispatcher at Everett to obtain his view of the situation, telling him - that if Supt. J. H. O'Neill deems it advisable the National guard will be called upon today to go to the scene of the catastrophe.<br>
<br>
SEATTLE, March 4. - Six laborers are reported to have been killed by an avalanche that destroyed Cascade, a small station east of the Cascade tunnel.  The report was brought to Seattle by Ed Clark, a section man, who has been working in the mountains.  He said that he walked through Cascade this morning and that everything had been wiped out but a cook shack.  Two men at the scene told him of the death of the six laborers, whose names are not known.<br>
<br>
Tells of Wellington Disaster.<br>
<br>
Clark was at Wellington at the time of the disaster Tuesday morning and gave a graphic account of his experience.<br>
<br>
"On that night about 40 of us, all Americans, were asleep with our clothes on in the bunk house just above Wellington," he said.  "Suddenly I heard a noise I can't describe, and then Charley Anderson, the section boss, rushed in.<br>
<br>
"'Boys, for God's sake, get up,' he shouted.  'Get out of this quick, men, or you'll be cleaned out.'  With that he ran out to tell others."<br>
<br>
"The lightning flashes were blinding and the thunder kept up an awful racket when we jumped out, and it was as dark as pitch when the lightning didn't blind us.  We heard a faint moaning down the gulch and made a break for it.  There were only two or three little railroad lanterns for light.  All around us we could hear trees snapping and other slides tumbling down.  We didn't know how
big they were, but we stumbled and rolled down into the gully where we could hear the cries.<br>
<br>
"Some had grabbed up what axes there were when they first ran out and then the lanterns showed a row of hands beckoning in every little hole and opening in the coaches.  We started chopping between the outstretched hands and so began to take them out.<br>
<br>
"We had worked all day and were pretty well played out, but we all set to work, each man for himself and none leading.  We could hear the passengers crying for water, and some were crying for nothing at all.  We got some of them out alive, but some of them died before we could get them, although they were alive when we reached the spot."<br>
<br>
Forty-eight Bodies Recovered.<br>
<br>
WELLINGTON, Wash., March 4. - Forty-eight bodies have been recovered from the wreckage brought down by Tuesday morning's avalanche, and of this number 41 have been identified.  Three bodies were exposed by workmen late this afternoon, but were not extricated from the wreckage.  They will be taken out tomorrow.  The body of G. R. Jenks, a fireman, was the last to be identified today.<br>
<br>
Coroner Snider has taken charge of $10,000 worth of jewelry and other valuables which he will hold pending identification by relatives of the victims.<br>
<br>
O'Neill's Car Pound.<br>
<br>
Supt. O'Neill's private car, containing the bodies of Trainmaster A. R. Blackburn and Secretary Lingcoy, was found today.  The searchers are working in the daytime only.  The Great Northern railroad today sent in 15 Alaskan sleds on which the bodies will be taken to a train at Skykomish, to be carried to Everett and Seattle.  All the railroad men's homes were at Everett.  Donald Cameron Filmore, fireman, aged 32, whose body has been recovered, was formerly a West Point cadet, and his mother is a prominent resident of Santa Barbara, Cal.<br>
<br>
All the wounded in the temporary hospital here are recovering today.  They will probably be taken to the big hotel at Scenic Hot Springs tomorrow.<br>
<br>
Of 700 sacks of mail carried away by the avalanche only 150 have been recovered.  There is no trace whatever of one mail car and seven clerks and weighers.  In some places cars are known to be under 70 feet of trees, snow, earth and rocks.<br>
<br>
The Great Northern is using all the resources at its command to open the track.  Every man and every plow that can find a place to work are busy night and day.  Supt. O'Neill estimates the actual loss to the road by destruction of property at $1,000,000.  The
four electric motors now lying demolished under the snow were valued at $250,000.  The only salvage from the wreck will be of old metal.<br>
<br>
Cold rain and increasing fear of snowslides added to the gloom of Wellington today.  Two bodies were sent down the trail and the others, wrapped in blankets, are lying in a railroad building.  Among the arrivals today were a number of friends and relatives of victims, a few of them women.<br>
<br>
Every courtesy was shown to these anxious people, but they contributed nothing to the cheerfulness of the camp.  The recovery of bodies will be slow until the locomotives arrive to pull away the giant trees whose trunks and branches are interlocked above the dead.  The rain falling on snow already packed so tight that a shovel will not enter it, is turning it to ice.<br>
<br>
Corpse Robber Caught.<br>
<br>
The working force in the avalanche now consists of 150 men, Americans.  Three of the Greek and Slavonian laborers stole clothing from the ruins, but they did not actually rob the dead bodies.  The misconduct of these men aroused such indignation that the railroad sent all the 75 foreign laborers away.<br>
<br>
The corpse robber who was caught in the act of taking a watch from the body of Sol Cohen, of Everett, gave his name as Robert Roberts to the disgust of Deputy Sheriff John Roberts, who arrested him.<br>
<br>
First Bodies Brought Out.<br>
<br>
EVERETT, March 4. - (Special.) - The first bodies to be brought from Wellington arrived at 8 o'clock tonight, when Undertaker Challacomb came down with those of Sol Cohen, an Everett tailor, and A. T. Bethel of Seattle.  The body of the latter was taken on to Seattle.<br>
<br>
SEATTLE, March 4. - The body of R. H. Bethel of Seattle, the first avalanche victim to be brought down from Wellington, arrived here tonight.  He was formerly a prominent civil engineer of New York and the body will be taken there for burial.<br>
<br>
(SPECIAL TO THE LEDGER)<br>
<br>
EVERETT, March 3. - An order of 15 Alaskan toboggans was placed in Seattle by the Great Northern today and these will be used in hauling bodies up the slope to Wellington and bringing down such of the injured as can stand the journey to Scenic.  Dr. H. K. Stockwell, in charge at the Wellington emergency hospital, reported this afternoon that all the injured were improving.<br>
<br>
Now come stories of the sordid side, Deputy Hill of Seattle held up an Italian suspiciously bundled up leaving Wellington.  The
deputy at the point of a gun found clothing, silk stockings and lot on the foreigner.<br>
<br>
It is reported that one Italian had a woman's hand covered with diamond rings.  These men were roughly handled and chased out of the vicinity.  The railroad has dispensed with the services of a gang of that class of laborers.<br>
<br>
The inevitable undertakers' battle for bodies seems to have started.  Marion Briggs, assistant to Undertaker Jerread of this city, returned tonight with the statement that Deputy Coroner Bostwick of King county refused to allow any one but Butterworth of Seattle to touch the bodies.<br>
<br>
Jerread of Everett was ordered by the railway company to take charge of the bodies, but has been unable to touch those belonging to this city.  Bostwick proposed to have all the bodies taken to Seattle and an inquest held there.  Coroner Snyder of King county passed through here today and said the bodies belonging in Everett would be left here and the others taken to Seattle.  Briggs said that Bostwick was having bodies stripped of clothing and sewed in sacks with labels, but that they were not embalmed as the Seattle men had little material.  Embalming fluid was sent up from Everett, but it has not been used on account of Bostwick's alleged interference.<br>

"Ten persons alive in car buried by Wellington slide," <B>The Tacoma Daily Ledger. </B>March 4, 1910<br>
<br>
One Man Entombed in Snow Sixty Hours Rescued in Half-Demented Condition.<br>
<br>
BODIES MAY BE CARRIED OFF BY FLOOD IF THAW COMES<br>
<br>
SEATTLE, March 3. - A special to the Post-Intelligencer from Everett says:<br>
<br>
One car at the Wellington slide has been excavated and ten persons found in it alive.<br>
<br>
The report last night that A. R. Blackburn's body was lost in another slide is denied tonight.  Blackburn and Supt. O'Neill's private secretary were both in the superintendent's private car when it went over.  That car has not been found and there is a faint hope that the occupants may be alive.<br>

One man entombed sixty hours has been dug from the snow.  He was half demented.<br>
<br>
WELLINGTON, Wash., March 3. - Thirty-one of the thirty-five bodies of avalanche victims recovered have been identified, among them being Bert Matthews of Cincinnati and F. W. Topping of Ashland, Ohio, whose bodies were found this afternoon.<br>
<br>
A fearful storm is raging here tonight, and snow is falling and is being whirled into drifts by a furious wind.  The change in the weather will make the trail from Scenic difficult and will hamper the men who have been digging for bodies.<br>
<br>
The snow plows working on both sides of Wellington made good progress today.  A rotary on the west side is four and a half miles from Wellington, between Korea and Alvin.  On the east side of the Cascades another rotary is near Gaynor, eight miles from Wellington.  The tunnel being open, there is a good prospect that the line to the east will be opened first, in which case the dead and injured will be taken to Spokane.<br>
<br>
WELLINGTON, Wash., March 3. - A list of passengers, trainmen and postal employees who were carried down by the avalanche that destroyed two Great Northern trains Tuesday morning and who are dead or missing, contains 36 names.  Statements of the number of laborers engaged in fighting the snow and who were sleeping on the ill-fated trains varies from 20 to 30.  Consequently an estimate of 100 dead seems conservative.  No one who had looked at the wreckage has the slightest hope of finding any of the missing people alive.  The explorations have uncovered only dead and some of these shockingly mangled.<br>
<br>
An avalanche of dry snow might have covered its victims alive, but the gorge at Wellington is packed tight with wet snow, ice, huge trees and glacial boulders of enormous weight.  Two of the bodies recovered today were those of electricians who were living in a cabin at the edge of Wellington and who were carried with their home 300 feet down the slope.<br>
<br>
All day a stream of men with packs strapped to their backs wound up the mountain path from Skykomish to Scenic and Wellington reminding Alaskans of the caravans that crossed the Chilcoot trail in Klondike days.  The men carried food and supplies for the injured and some went up to dig for the bodies of friends or relatives.  A few were sight-seers, and these were told that they were not wanted.<br>
<br>
Looter Forced to Leave.<br>
<br>
A laborer was caught taking trinkets from a dead woman's body and was compelled to start down the trail at once.<br>
<br>
One hundred and fifty men dug for bodies in the avalanche debris today.  Among the bodies found today were those of former
Prosecuting Attorney R. M. Barnhart, of Spokane; Conductor J. L. Pettit, who, after a trip on foot to Skykomish, went back to his post of peril, and Mrs. M. A. Covington, of Olympia; who left Spokane to celebrate in Seattle today her golden wedding anniversary.<br>
<br>
If the searchers locate the Pullman cars intact in the snow they may take out many bodies in a short time, but it is likely that the dead are strewn all through acres of debris.  At the present rate of progress it would require weeks to recover all the bodies.  After the track is open engines and tackle will lift the huge trees and boulders.<br>
<br>
There are no coffins at Wellington, and the dead, wrapped in blankets, lie on the snow, well preserved.<br>
<br>
Snowplows and wrecking trains, working eastward from Skykomish made good progress today.<br>
<br>
Supt. O'Neill of the Great Northern today said he expected the railroad to be in operation about April 1.<br>
<br>
The Great Northern's costly experience with snow in the Cascades this winter has caused renewal of discussion of the project of building a tunnel at a level of 1,000 feet lower than the present one, and whose west portal would be at Scenic Hot Springs.  The tunnel was figured out years ago and passed upon as feasible by European engineers.<br>
<br>
Trace Blood Stains in Snow.<br>
<br>
Workers searching for bodies frequently find victims by following blood stains throughout the snow.  The melting snow has carried the stains from the mangled bodies down to the stream at the bottom of the gulch.  Men with shovels upon finding one of these crimson leads, start at the edge of the stream and tunnel through the snow until they come to the body of the victim.  The snow is packed like cement and the bodies that were not mangled by the wreckage of the cars, were horribly crushed by the weight of the icy mass.<br>
<br>
It is feared that many of the bodies will never be recovered.  The warm weather and rains of the last three days have turned the little mountain stream that flows through the canyon into a raging torrent and the water is fast undermining the snow which was carried far out across the bottom of the gorge.  It is believed that many bodies were carried clear across the gulch and buried under forty feet of snow.  As the stream rises and the water undermines the debris there is danger of the bodies dropping into the river and being carried away by the swift current.<br>
<br>
Blizzard Again Raging.<br>
<br>
The rain which has been falling for three days turned into snow
tonight and a fearful blizzard is raging.  The addition of new snow to the covering that lies eighteen feet deep on the mountainsides increases the danger of more slides, and adds to the peril of the rescuers who are laboring night and day at the task of removing the bodies of the dead.<br>
<br>
Owing to trouble with foreign laborers who attempted to loot the bodies Supt. O'Neill has sent all of them from the camp and is employing only American workmen.<br>
<br>
Crawled Out of Hole Naked.<br>
<br>
H. H. White, of 510 Broadway, Seattle, a traveling salesman for the American Paper company, who is confined to the hospital with a chest injury, says:<br>
<br>
"Things happened so fast it is hard to remember what took place.  I heard a crash like thunder, then I felt myself going through a window or the roof in my pajamas.  Crawford, a surveyor, followed as though shot from a catapult.<br>
<br>
"Brakeman Ross climbed through a hole without his nightshirt or underclothes.  Crawford warned me to keep cool till the snow stopped moving.  There was a heavy wet snow and a strong wind was blowing at the time.<br>
<br>
"I pulled out Porter Al Anderson from among the debris and then got two blankets, wrapped his feet in one and gave the other to a naked brakeman named Ross.<br>
<br>
"I heard a woman crying and trainmen from Wellington worked like nailers and rescued her.  They are deserving of great credit for their bravery and untiring efforts.<br>
<br>
"A number of big trees was among the debris that struck our car."<br>
<br>
Lucius Anderson, the negro porter of the sleeper, is the only survivor out of nineteen in the car.<br>
<br>

THE SCANDINAVIAN AMERICAN BANK FAILURE<br>
<br>
William P. Bonney, "The Scandinavian American Bank Failure, .... the 1921 events, "<B>History of Pierce County. </B> pages 893-786.<br>
<br>
Tearful women and strong-hearted men with drawn faces, swallowed their grief in little groups at 13th and Pacific on Monday, January 17, 1921, following the failure of the Scandinavian American Bank to open its doors on the 15th.  Women wept at their losses, which in many cases involved the savings of a life-time, but no demonstrations occurred.  The crowd was anxious, but peaceful, under the watchful eyes of police officers.<br>
<br>
The crash, later followed by the failure of the Seattle bank of the same name, was the greatest financial disaster in the city's history and that of the northwest.  There were some ten thousand depositors with money in the Tacoma bank, and many business firms were pinched by the suspension of the financial institution.<br>
<br>
Forbes P. Haskell, Jr., former banker and the local representative of Hugh C. Wallace, was appointed a special bank examiner by Governor Hart on Monday, and took immediate charge, with Guy E. Kelly named as legal adviser.  The failure of the bank, according to the state bank examining department, was due entirely to gross mismanagement, an accumulation of non-liquid assets, and to building operations.<br>
<br>
The latter included the erection of the sixteen-story office building at 11th and Pacific, the giant steel frame of which was nearly completed, and until the eventful Saturday was the center of a din of noisy riveting, but which stood silent on the 17th, as hundreds of depositors a short distance down the street clamored at the closed and barred steel doors of the defunct institution.<br>
<br>
The failure of the bank was not due to local business con-<br>
ditions, but to events entirely peculiar to the bank itself, Other local banks reported only small withdrawals following the crash; and all of them at once offered business and financial aid to needy depositors of the bank which had failed.<br>
<br>
Superior Court Judges Chapman, Card, Clifford and Askren met and on the 19th decided to call a grand jury to consider the failure.  On the 20th there was a large meeting of depositors in the main auditorium and basement of Our Savior's Evangelical Lutheran Church, at which A. R. Titlow acted as chairman.  Ole Granrud, as chairman, was named to head a depositors' committee of ten members.<br>
<br>
On February 9th Ole S. Larson, president of the defunct bank, was arrested at his home in Seattle, charged with appropriating $60,000 of the bank's funds to his own use.  His bail, set at $100,000, was later reduced to $20,000, which was furnished after he had spent a
night in jail.<br>
<br>
The first grand jury to be held by the county for a period of five years, met on the 23rd, and C. C. Hume was named foreman.  Judge Cushman, in the federal court, also appointed Haskell as receiver for the Scandinavian American Bank Building Company on March 2, in an action in the federal court, brought by a lien holder.  On March 16th there was a warrant on its way to California for the arrest of Jafet Lindeberg; and the following day Gustaf Lindberg was arrested on the charge of borrowing excessive sums and in making loans without authority.<br>
<br>
Lindeberg was arrested on the 19th, charged with being a fugitive from justice.  Ten new charges were filed against Larson on March 22nd, making twenty-two to date; he was arrested for the fifth time two days later.  His total bonds amounted to $77,000.  George Williamson, former attorney for the bank and a director, was also arrested on the 26th.<br>
<br>
A suit was filed in San Francisco the same day to compel Jafet Lindeberg and Erik 0. Lindblom to return $464,955 said to have been due with interest, suit being filed in the federal court.<br>
<br>
On April 1st sweeping condemnation of what it termed unscrupulous management" of the affairs of the bank in the nature of "irregular and questionable transactions" which led to the failure of the bank; severe criticism of the state bank commissioner's office for permitting those conditions to exist; and a stinging rebuke for members of the Tacoma police department, including higher officials, for what it declared was an effort to "play to the galleries" at the sacrifice of efficiency in law enforcement, were all included in the report of the grand jury, after being in session twenty nine days, during which time it examined 145 witnesses.<br>
<br>
Sixty-four true bills were returned.  Juggling of funds and the listing of bonds of unknown value among the bank's assets were also charged.  Members of the police department were charged with being "loud mouthed" in self praise in seeking to wear the mantle of glory as the "Great I am."<br>
<br>
The complaint was signed by C. C. Hume, foreman, Jas.  L. Hunt, D. P. Green, A. F. Johnson, F. J. Wallace, Jas.  Ratchford, A. G. Anderson, N. R. Protsch, Laura Ranney, Leona Jones, Sigurd Carlson, Nellie Pendergart, Carrie D. Robinson, Jno.<br>
S.     Himes, and H. Bass.<br>
<br>
On May 9th Ole S. Larson was placed on trial in Judge Askren's department of the Superior Court, upon the specific charge of loaning  $10,000 to himself without authorization of the directors of  the bank.  He was found guilty on the Ilth, and on May 13th
went on trial for a second time, being again found guilty on the 14th.<br>
<br>
On the same day the extradition of Jafet Lindeberg was denied in a fight in California courts.  On June 8th Judge Walter M. French ordered a directed verdict of acquittal in the trial of Charles Drury, declaring that the state had not proved that Drury had acted illegally in loaning $200,000 of the funds of the bank to the Scandinavia Bank Building Company.<br>
<br>
The following day all of the cases then pending against Drury and Gustaf Lindberg were dismissed by Judge French, of Kitsap County, sitting in place of Judge M. L. Clifford, after Judge French had refused to permit three of the cases to be submitted to the jury and directed verdicts of not guilty to be returned.<br>
<br>
Two of these directed verdicts were in cases against Drury, and the third against Lindberg.  J. E. Chilberg, of Seattle, former president of the banks at Tacoma and Seattle, surrendered to Sheriff Thomas N. Morris on July 1st.  Five indictments had been returned against him, and he was released upon furnishing  $35,000 bonds.<br>
<br>
The Seattle bank also closed on July 1st.  The first 10 per cent dividend was paid to the Tacoma bank depositors on July 1st.  On August 5th the five cases against Chilberg were dismissed, after demurrers to the indictments were sustained.<br>
<br>
Gustaf Lindberg was arrested on September 16th in another criminal action.  On November 11th Larson was convicted for the third time, in Judge W. 0. Chapman's department; and three days later Lindberg went on trial, charged with borrowing $13,000 from the bank while a director and without the authority of the board of directors.<br>

On January 7th Gustaf Lindberg was given a sentence of from one to five years at the state penitentiary in Judge Chapman's court, following his conviction of December 3rd, 1921.  The third 10 per cent dividend to depositors was declared on January 17th.<br>
<br>
On February 16th Jafet Lindeberg, Gustaf Lindberg, 0. S. Larson, J.
E. Chilberg and Charles Drury, faced new charges filed by Prosecutor Selden in the Justice Court of John W. Linck.  On the 18th Governor William D. Stephens, of California, signed the warrant for the extradition of Lindeberg; but an attempt to arrest him at his California home by Rex S. Roudebush of Tacoma and W. B. Severyn of Seattle resulted in a display of firearms on the part of one of his relatives.<br>
<br>
Lindeberg's attorneys hastily drew up papers for court action looking to the blocking of extradition, and also charged that the Washington officials were attempting to kidnap him, and further alleging unjust prosecution.  The San Francisco court granted his request for a writ of habeas corpus, and Lindeberg was again a free man.<br>
<br>
On March 15th the Supreme Court of Washington granted Larson a new trial on his first appealed case.  On May 3rd R. F. Laffon, of Tacoma, was made a special commissioner in the federal court for the sale of the bank building.  It was announced that the sum of  $316,565.55 must be raised to cover all liens, attorney fees and court costs.<br>
<br>
The attorney fees were given as $24,635; interest at  $23,354.47; and court costs  $469.32. Larson stood trial again on May 24th, in Judge Clifford's department , on a charge of illegal borrowing of  $1,200 through an overdraft.  The jury failed to agree.  On September 28th the fourth dividend of 10 per cent was mailed to depositors, amounting to about $406,000.<br>

S.     A. BANK FAILURE EVENT OF YEAR<br>
<br>
Early in January, 1923, the Supreme Court affirmed the conviction of Ole S. Larson of the previous November, carrying a sentence of from three to five years in the penitentiary. lt was thereupon announced that eleven cases still standing against him would be dismissed.  In all, thirty-two criminal cases had been filed.  Nineteen were dismissed, one resulted in an acquittal, and three in convictions.<br>

On January 30th, Gustaf Lindberg was given another rehearing by the Supreme Court, on his conviction of borrowing $13,000 from the bank while a director without proper action being taken thereon.  On February 15th, Larson was also given another rehearing; but on June 9th his appeal was decided against him.  On the 18th he presented himself at the penitentiary at Walla Walla, without a guard being sent for him.<br>
<br>
On July 6th the Federal Court set a minimum price of $430,000 on the bank building skeleton.  A fifth dividend of 10 per cent, amounting to about $405,000, was paid to depositors on September 10th.  On October 9th the Supreme Court denied the rehearing of Gustaf Lindberg; but on the following day Lieutenant Governor William J. Coyle, then acting as governor during the absence of Hart, issued a full and complete pardon to the convicted banker.  His action was severely criticised in Pierce County and in other parts of the state.  Coyle had been a close friend of a son of the banker for a number of years.<br>

BANK FRAUD<br>
<br>
Herbert Hunt, "Fraud at Fidelity Trust Company," Tacoma, its history and its builders. Chicago: S.J. Clkarke, 1916, II, p. 116-118. (Chapter sixty-three).<br>
<br>
Edward Albertson, cashier of the Fidelity Trust Company, disappeared in August, 1891, after having stolen a large amount, and there followed an exciting string of incidents.<br>
<br>
The first intimation the public had of the absconding was the news of the "mysterious disappearance and absence" of John Cohoon, Albertson's brother-in-law, and it was charged that he had been abducted and was being held in a secret place by detectives led by M. C. Sullivan, of the Thiel Agency.<br>
<br>
Cohoon was kept in the Donnelly Hotel and Harry H. Collier, then a porter there, was detailed to wait upon him.  Collier was told that Cohoon was a dangerous lunatic-a plausible story, as the hotels in that day, before car lines had been built to the hospital at Fort Steilacoom and before automobiles had come, frequently lodged insane persons for a night or so.<br>
<br>
Sullivan denied that he was detaining Cohoon, but when be learned that Cohoon's wife was ill from worry he took Cohoon to jail where he was held in default of $10,000 bonds.<br>
<br>
Then Sullivan and Deputy Sheriff Evans, with a warrant issued from Justice Harry A. Sharp's court, went to Seattle and arrested R. B. Albertson, cousin of Edward.  The arrest was made in front of the Rainier Club.  Albertson was with William E. Bailey who insisted upon accompanying his friend, and he entered the closed carriage which the officers had brought.<br>
<br>
They were taken to Black River Junction where Sullivan expected to catch a train for Tacoma.  Seattle friends of Albertson learned of the arrest, hastily organized a rescue party, and procured warrants for the arrest of the detectives.  The train
was late and before Sullivan and Evans could get their prisoner out of King County they were arrested, charged with abduction, and taken back -to Seattle where Albertson was released.<br>
<br>
Early the next morning Albertson, Bailey, George H. Preston and Herman Chapin came to Tacoma and going to Justice Sharp's court asked if a warrant had been issued.  Sharp replied in the affirmative, reading a portion of the warrant to Albertson who at once placed himself in the jurisdiction of the court.<br>
<br>
Sharp fixed his bail at $5,000, which promptly was furnished, the securities being Governor Ferry, Bailey and Chapin.  The warrant had been sworn out by T. B. Wallace and charged Albertson with aiding in the concealment of "stolen property, to-wit: Notes and other valuable securities of the value of $9,000," belonging to the Fidelity Company.<br>
<br>
Albertson was given a hearing in Sharp's court September 15 and it then developed that the accused man's cousin, Edward, the cashier, had removed securities worth $600,000 from the company's vaults.  He'had placed all the books and papers of the company in the vaults, then had inserted a match in the combination so that the officers could not open the bank for business.<br>
<br>
Albertson then sent a letter to T. B. Wallace, advising him of what had been done and promising that if Wallace would sign certain papers, copies of which were enclosed, get a boat and one boatman, row to Brown's Point and there deliver the signed papers to Fred N. Chandler, he would be given the securities and the new combinations of the vaults.<br>
<br>
All this must be done before 9 o'clock that morning or the securities would be burned.  Wallace testified that he had received the letter at 4 o'elock in the morning, and had at once consulted the other officers of the bank the result being that he had made the trip and at the point designated had received the papers, vault combination, etc.<br>
<br>
The trial lasted several days and R. B. Albertson was bound over to the superior court September 17th- An examination of the books showed that Edward Albertson was short in his accounts about $20,000, the amount which he admitted to have taken.<br>
<br>
Edward Albertson and Chandler were captured near Gardiner, Coos County, Oregon, September 16th after Albertson had been shot in the side by an excited member of the posse.  Chandler was brought to Tacoma at once and Albertson as soon as his wound would permit.  Most of the stolen money was recovered at this time.<br>
<br>
October 23d Edward Albertson pleaded guilty to grand larceny.  He exonerated his cousin, who asked for a change of venue.  Judge
Allyn sentenced Edward Albertson to ten years in the penitentiary, and Fred N. Chandler to five years.<br>

THE WASHINGTON TERRITORIAL MILITIA IN THE BANNOCK<br>
INDIAN WAR, 1878<br>

<br>
The following message signaled the beginning of the Bannock Indian War; was received by the Military Division of the Pacific on 31 May 1878 and forwarded to the General of the Army in Washington, D.C., the same date by General McDowell.  The War Department acknowledged receipt and advised that General Phil Sheridan, commanding the Military Division of Missouri and General George Crook, commanding the Department of the Platte had been notified.<br>

Adjutant General, Mil Div, Pacific, San Francisco, Calif.<br>
<br>
Commanding officer Collins, Fort Boise, telegraphs as follows:<br>
<br>
"Bannock Indians have been making serious threats and ordering settlers off Big Camas Prairie.  Man arrived from there this evening reports two settlers shot by Indians this morning.  Both wounded; got to Dixie Station 60 miles distant; 90 miles to where Indians are camped between Big Camas and Snake in Lava Beds.<br>
<br>
"Bannocks reported to have messengers out to chief of Piutes, vicinity of Malheur Agency.  Numbers estimated 200 warriors, well armed and supplied with ammunition.  Settlers have counted 60 lodges; 20 more, with Buffalo Horn, just joined them."<br>
<br>
Collins telegraphs will start for scene of trouble with seventy-
five men tonight or tomorrow morning, and requests order.  As the ground lies between three geographical departments, and the Bannocks belong to General Crook, I submit the case at once for instructions.  I will order Collins to work with caution and find if extensive outbreak is certain.<br>
<br>
Am not sure enough of peace with Upper Columbia Indians to deplete troops in neighborhood just now.  Harney, McDermitt, Hall and Bidwell are the nearest.<br>

Following dispatch, dated today, just received from Patton, commanding Boise:<br>

"Messenger arrived this morning from Captain Bernard, commanding Camas Prairie; writes as follows:  Arrived Camas Prairie June 1st, where men were shot.  Indians have taken herder's tent, contents, and horses, killing three of them.  Indians are supposed to be encamped in a strong place, Lava Beds, seven miles from here.<br>
<br>
"The best estimate I can get there is about 300.  To reach them, have to move over very rough country, so shall develop their condition carefully.  Some think trouble done by young bucks; others think they mean war.  Indians who are living in settlements have gone to Lava Beds.  From letters sent me from Wood Creek, think the party committing depredations on overland road are Piutes and Umatillas returning to their country.  Going west from Camas this party took King Hill Station, overland road, driving off stage stock, cutting up harness, etc.<br>
<br>
"Men escaped and observed depredations from distance.  Employed good scout, who says he can find whether Indians left Lava Beds or not.  Will prospect, and, if gone, follow trail."<br>
<br>
This is substance of Bernard's message.  Another messenger, from Press reporter with Captain Collins, states that:  "Buffalo Horn, evidently hostile, told Corder, friendly white, he had better leave with family, which he did.  Twenty-five or 30 have joined Captain Collins.  Boise Jim, of Camas Creek, on learning of approach of troops, left to join the Indians on Camas Prairie."<br>
<br>
Thomas Silvey, messenger, brother of Silvey shot, and member of the camp first attacked, gives Patton details of first outbreak, which Patton has mailed.  Silvey is a reliable man; believes attack was premeditated.  Stockmen had been warned for some time. Indians finally took treacherous means to kill three of them;<br>
succeeded in wounding two, one fatally.  Squaw-man Dempsey writes Governor Brayman, Indians are acting in concert.  Intend fighting if troops are sent.  Later advises report threatened difficulty in Owyhee Valley.<br>
<br>
Indians, supposed to be Bannocks, surrounded house in Jordan Valley; demanded of occupants guns and ammunition; said they were looking for soldiers.  This from Sheriff Hayes, Owyhee country, who fears trouble in that section. Later dispatch from Patton says:  "Late advices by overland stage report two wagons captured and destroyed by Indians just beyond Glenn's Ferry.  This is supposed to be party that attacked King Hill yesterday, as they were then moving in that direction.  They cut the ferry loose.  Nothing heard of the teamsters.  One of the wagons had considerable ammunition and powder; also revolvers."<br>

<br>
TO THE GOVERNOR OF IDAHO, BOISE CITY:<br>
<br>
Alarming reports have reached here about hostile attitude of Bannock Indians.  So far as I can learn, this has been brought about by Indians firing on two whites whom they had ordered off the Big Camas Prairie.  It would seem the Indians had looked on the whites as intruders and trespassers.  Can you give me any light on the subject, and can you take measures to allay hostile feeling, to see if the questions can be met without an Indian War?<br>
<br>
I have telegraphed to this effect to General Howard, and directed him to confer with you.<br>

The trouble grows out of the claims of the Indians to Big Camas Prairie.  The present treaty rights I will explain by letter.  In addition to the shooting two men, King Hill Station, overland road, was raided and horses taken.  This indicates a settled purpose.  The Sheriff of Owyhee telegraphs from Silver City that 150 are raiding on Jordan Valley Stage Road, without violence as yet, but threatening.  I am enjoining caution, and have written Major Collins to avoid collision until inquiry.  There is danger of general war.<br>

Report from citizens of Boise. "Indians raiding Overland Road, seventy miles south of Captain Collin's camp, at Big Camas Prairie.  Have destroyed King Hill Station, several ranch buildings, Glenn's Ferry, burned Eli and Watkin's freight wagons, stolen over one hundred horses.  Indians on the war path surely. Families fleeing and fortifying."  Edward Paine sends following: "Paine's Ferry, 1 June.  Five families came here for protection last night.  Expect assistance from Boise City to hold this
place.  This is the stage-ferry, thirty miles above Glenn's, the only one left on the river.  Heavy teams are on the road.  Can get fifty men to hold place if we can arm them.  They ask for order on Patton for fifteen (days) rations and supplies.  They will start tomorrow if they get the supplies."  They report further:  "Twenty citizens of Rocky Bar, under Sheriff Campbell, joined Captain Bernard; twenty five more, under G.A. Parson, have joined Captain Collins."  Governor Brayman sends similar information, adding the right to Big Camas Prairie is evidently the cause.  Am not satisfied as to disposition of Buffalo Horn.  I will continue concentrating at Boise adequate force unless otherwise directed.<br>

Think Sanford with two companies will be enough from below.  I have set in motion troops so as to have five hundred additional effectives in the field.  Wheaton's district is untouched; ready for troubles in the Upper Columbia, if they arise.  I meet Wheaton at Walla Walla the ninth instant, and then proceed to Boise, getting there in advance of marching troops.  Grover goes thither at once, awaiting me at Boise.<br>

Cannot your chief quartermaster induce telegraph company to reconnect with Walla Walla from Baker City.  Gamble, general superintendent, told me the War Department desired it.  This connection will help operations, particularly should Columbia Indians take advantage of Bannock outbreak.<br>

"Captain Bainbridge, commanding Fort Hall, reports on fourth instant that an Indian, arrived at the agency second instant from Buffalo Horn's camp, says Indians at Camas Prairie had done no wrong, that Buffalo Horn had but 10 lodges, and was coming to agency in two weeks.  All quiet at agency and vicinity tonight."<br>

I have telegraphed Howard, and Major Stanford, and Governor of Idaho to see if it is possible to communicate with the Indians at Camas Prairie and avoid hostilities.<br>

Also asked Crook to instruct Captain Bainbridge to send some of the Fort Hall Indians to Camas Prairie, to say to them that we do not wish to make war upon them if they have done no wrong, and urge them to come at once to the agency, to avoid the parties in Idaho who are seeking them for the attack made on the two white men in Camas Prairie.<br>

On the 15th May Buffalo Horn gave me the same assurances as you mention, that after digging camas he would return with his followers to Fort Hall.  I gave him permission to buy one hundred (100) cartridges and a little powder, to hunt during his stay.  I have yet only rumor that he has changed his mind, but he appears to be hostile.  Before I received your dispatch the troops were
on Camas Prairie and the Indians beyond reach.  It had become a purely military question.  The time to approach them, except through the military authorities, appears to have gone before I could reach them.  When General Howard arrives something may be done in that direction, if possible.  I will aid them to find the original of the difficulties and to settle it.  The Associated Press have an unfaithful agent here, whose reports are unreliable and often mere invention.  Several new depredations and a few murders are reported tonight.<br>

Arrived here this morning.  Sent force under Grover, including Sanford, to clear up scattering Indians toward Fort Hall.  Please ask commanding officer Fort Hall to work towards Grover to detail the Bannock families reported going to Fort Hall, principally relations those on war-path.  I am concentrating against Bannocks and Malheurs, near Sheep Ranch, six miles from Owyhee Ferry, on Winnemucca Road, taking charge of the column myself.  Ten citizens and four friendly Indians altogether, from the first
outbreak, killed.  I think the Lemhi and the friendly Bannocks are working homeward.  Buffalo Horn is leading the hostiles. Weisers, Piutes and Bannocks furnish the malcontents now raiding. Difficulty began by a drunken Indian; then Buffalo Horn said, as Captain Bainbridge would hold full tribe responsible, they might as well go to war at once, taking horses and other property.  Should there be real breakout in Wheaton's district, please communicate both to him and me; to avoid delay.  Shall probably need no more troops this way, so the five hundred reserve at San Francisco, in case of imperative need, could go to Wheaton. Governor Brayman authorizes Bainbridge to use his arms for citizens, should necessity require.<br>

<br>
Yesterday, I responded to General Howard in writing, and, with his assent, inclose you direct a duplicate.<br>
<br>
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,<br>
<br>

<br>
EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT, IDAHO TERRITORY<br>
Boise City, 13 June 1878<br>
<br>
Brig Gen O.O. Howard, Commanding Department of the Columbia:<br>
<br>
Sir:  In reply to your inquiry as to the claim of the Bannocks to the "Big Camas Prairie" in Alturas County, I have the honor to refer to the treaty between the United States of America and the Eastern band of Shoshones and the Bannock tribe of Indians, concluded 3 July 1868, ratification advised 16 February 1869, found on page 931 of "Reversion of Indian Treaties," published in 1873.<br>
<br>
Article 2, page 933, provided that "It is agreed that whenever the Bannocks desire a reservation to be set apart for their use, or whenever the President of the United States shall deem it advisable for them to be put on a reservation, he shall cause a suitable one to be selected for them in their present country, which shall embrace reasonable portions of the "Port Neuf and Kansas Prairie" countries, and that when this reservation is declared, the United States shall secure to the Bannocks the same rights and privileges therein, and make the same and like expenditures therein for their benefit, except the agency-house and residence of agent, in proportion to their numbers as herein provided for the Shoshoe reservation."<br>
<br>
Article 6, last paragraph, page 935, provides that "The President may, at any time, order a survey of these reservations, and when so surveyed Congress shall provide for protecting the rights of the Indian settlers on these improvements, and may fix the character of the title held by each."<br>
<br>
Very liberal provisions are made for the acquirement of homesteads, the protection of private rights, the establishment of schools, and the encouragement of agriculture.
It seems to be understood that "Kansas Prairie" is a misprint, there being no prairie of that name West of the mountains, and that "Camas Prairie" is meant.<br>
<br>
The Indians understand it thus, and without exception or doubt insist that the "Big Camas Prairie" is theirs by that treaty.  In proof of the sincerity of their belief, it is true that they have each year, during the season for digging for camas roots and hunting, resorted in great numbers to and occupied this tract of country.  The camas root is to them the equivalent of our potato, and it grows spontaneously in vast quantities on these grounds.  I have been visited by a great number of Indians who uniformly claim "Camas Prairie" as their "garden."  They declare their rights by this treaty whether the word be "Kansas" or "Camas."<br>
<br>
These Indians state that the climate and soil at Fort Hall reservation are not adapted to the raising of vegetables, and say that the "Camas Prairie" is their garden, without which they would suffer hunger, for the dried and pulverized root of the camas is easily transported and is capable of preservation through all seasons.<br>
<br>
To lose "Camas Prairie" is considered by them the loss of their only sure and abundant supply of vegetable food.  The increasing wants of our advancing population have for years invited increasing encroachments upon this prairie.  Herders crowd upon it with thousands of cattle, destroying the product, and bands of "hogs" that dig up the roots, destroying not only the growing crop, but the seed of the future.<br>
<br>
This process advances in proportions each year, and the discontent and resentment of the Indians become more bitter and dangerous.  Left to itself, this condition of things tends to collision and bloodshed, which, in savage casuistry, is war.<br>
<br>
It does not appear that the President has, as provided in the treaty stipulations, formally set apart Camas Prairie, to the use of these Indians, or directed its survey, nor that Congress has acted on the subject.<br>
<br>
If it was the intention of the parties to the treaty to set apart Camas Prairie to the use of these Indians, as they claim, it lies with the President and Congress to carry that understanding into effect.  If not, it should be so declared and early steps taken to advise all parties of the right of the matter.<br>
<br>
It is at this late day evidently better that the Indian claim, if recognized, should be extinguished in fair equivalents under a new arrangement, and the land in question surveyed and opened to settlement.  Stock-raising, and the constant passing of the animals over the prairie to market, renders the exclusive use by the Indians impossible, and plants in the midst of our growing settlements an ever-threatening danger.  During the long and unwise delay the conditions have changed, and if the national
authorities would, they cannot now in safety and with hope of peaceful results, confirm the Indian claims.<br>
<br>
I respectfully furnish you these facts and suggestions for your present information in aid of such suggestions as it may be your duty to make to the superior authority, only adding an urgent appeal that the matter may be definitely and distinctly settled at an early day.<br>
<br>
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,<br>

Bernard's report of the Indians leaving Stein's Mountains reached me at Keeney's Ferry this morning.  I immediately ordered Grover with his three companies of cavalry and company of volunteers (Militia) to push for Old's Ferry and watch against hostiles going northward.  No other substantial change of troops was needed.  Bernard with three companies of cavalry and a howitzer, to be increased by McGregor when he nears Harney, is moving in direct pursuit along the trail.  The hostiles threaten to go along the ridge from Stein's Mountains to Umatilla, but I think still they will aim toward Salmon River country.<br>

Following dispatch just received from department commander, dated Silver Lake, near Camp Curry, June 25th:  "Hostiles increase as they advance.  Beginning of outbreak, Bannocks formed junction with discontented Indians north of them, then with Pah-Utes under Otis and Egan near Juniper Lake.  Some Klamaths have joined them here.  Some Umatillas have been endeavoring to form junction. Some have succeeded and are with them.  General Howard is of the opinion hostiles intend to move north following Silver Creek, striking nearest route to South Fork, John Day River, then up Granite to Bridge's Creek, joining discontented Cayuses and other Indians as may be in that vicinity.  To provide for this contingency, Grover will be sent at once to Walla Walla.  The companies of cavalry in the district of the Clearwater and those now under Major Sanford will constitute his command in the field - E, D, H, I and M, First Cavalry, total two hundred and forty men with such additions of artillery and infantry as the district commander may judge proper to assign.  Major Sanford with D and I companies will halt near Malheur City and go into camp on Willow Creek till the probabilities of the Indians going north are
determined.  If hostiles move north, Sanford will move his command and join Grover.  As Bendire is so near this point he will come forward at once with the infantry and artillery battalions now moving forward.  General Howard for the present will remain with his column, consisting of four companies of cavalry, two of artillery and seven of infantry, total four hundred and eighty men, and will follow right after the enemy whichever way he may turn.  You will keep General Howard informed as to affairs in your district or anything relating to the hostiles which may be ascertained by you.  Should you lose communication with the general, the force at McDermitt should in the event of a northward movement pass to the railroad, thence by steamer to Wallula as fast as possible, with such increase in force as the division commander thinks proper.  Possibly it may be best to call an Eastern regiment.  It will be September before it could reach here, but it could reach you within two weeks; therefore it had better be sent to you.  If you take the field yourself, Grover can command the cavalry, Merriam the infantry, and Miller the artillery.  The Umatillas in Fox Valley are said to have sent their women and children to the reservation and threaten to join the hostiles.  The general thinks it would be wise to have a point of observation on the Umatilla Reservation and there station Grover's force.  It will be necessary to act promptly.

The hostiles crossed the river near this point on Sunday, 30 June and are now in Fox Valley; there they have been joined by the Umatillas who warned the people in country if they wished to save their lives.  The indications are that the hostiles will cross the Snake River near mouth of Grand Ronde, keeping their journey under the cover of the woods of the Blue Mountains.  They may, however, strike the Columbia between Celito and Umatilla if we are not fortunate enough to bring them to battle.  The country over which we have marched from Camp Curry to this place is the most broken and rugged I have ever seen.  General Wheaton, if any dispatches have reached him, has been ordered to be ready for the Indians as they emerge from the mountains into his district. Egbert will move toward Walla Walla from Boise so as to check and disposition of the hostiles to turn back.  Citizens have skirmished with them.  One citizen killed and several wounded.

"Referring to General Howard's instructions telegraphed me on the 28th, ultimo, I have to report that the movement northward anticipated by him has actually occurred.  Agent Cornoyer informs me that the Umatilla Indians fought 400 hostile Snakes all day yesterday, killing 30 and losing 2, at a point 40 miles south of the Agency, about 80 miles from this point.  This I received late last evening, with an earnest appeal from the citizens of Pendleton, near the Agency, for military protection.  I had, an hour before receiving this intelligence, just moved all my available force here, 54 men with artillery, to Wallula to take boat and observe points on Columbia, near mouth of John Day's River, where it was supposed hostiles would attempt a crossing.<br>
<br>
This little river-patrol command I immediately recalled, and they are now enroute to Pendleton, 42 miles distant.  Operators at points on Columbia report unusual signal fires burning last night, and the women and children from Umatilla and Wallula are now coming here to Walla Walla for protection.  A messenger who left Pendleton at 4 A.M. today reports people living six miles beyond Pendleton as having been driven from their homes by hostiles.  It is exceedingly unfortunate I have no force with which to attack these 400 hostiles who are now devastating the country they pass through.  We cannot tell yet whether they intend crossing the Snake River near its mouth enroute to the British line, or whether they will turn east toward Salmon River
country.  I would be glad to have any available troops sent to report here at earliest date.  No communication with General Howard by courier to LaGrande and thence by telegraph to Malheur for several days.  No communication with Portland all day, wire down.<br>

Dispatch of this date received, I have done all in my power to prevent Moses from permitting his people and Smohalla's from leaving their hunting and fishing grounds during the present campaign and joining hostile bands.  Today, I received and sent to General Howard a very handsome letter from Moses, reiterating his previous promises to remain peaceful, and do what is right. He said last summer, and again this spring, that if he is let alone he will keep his people quiet.  Parties have seen Moses within thirty days tell me he is perfectly well disposed.  Whether under temptation he could restrain his five or six hundred well-armed Indians, with plenty of ammunition, is considered very doubtful.  He could, if he desired to do so, control Smohalla's and other Columbia and Spokane bands, and within forty-eight hours move with one thousand well-armed and well-mounted warriors.<br>

Yesterday at Pilot Rock I formed a junction with the troops Wheaton had ordered to meet me under Throckmorton.  It being uncertain from conflicting reports whether the main body of the hostiles was near the head of Butter Creek or nearer the Columbia crossing, I sent two excellent scouts to place their camp, and at sunrise moved two columns, one under Throckmorton, consisting of two companies of artillery, one of infantry and a few volunteers, which proceeded by the stage road directly to Butter Creek Post Office; the other column, consisting of seven companies, First Cavalry as a battalion under Bernard, severally commanded by McGregor, Whipple, Bendire, Winters, Parnell, Ward and Bomus, with about twenty of Robbin's scouts and a Gatling gun.  I accompanied Bernard's column.  We had proceeded some three miles toward the headwaters of Butter Creek when we met the two scouts, who reported the Indians in a height about three miles from us.<br>
<br>
Bernard, taking the trot, moved quickly into position over three troublesome foothills, the last of which is fenced by a canyon, and over a mile in ascent.  The cavalry sped from hill to hill, till in the vicinity of the enemy strongly posted on the rocky crest.  All the companies, except McGregor's with the pack train, were deployed and used during the engagement.  The advance was made along several approaches in a handsome manner, not a man falling out of ranks.  The different sides of the hill were steeper than Missionary Ridge, still the troops, though encountering a severe fire that emptied some saddles and killed many horses, did not waver, but skirmished to the very top, the enemy advancing his position and running to the next height in rear, slightly higher and specially crowned with natural defenses of lava rock.  In twenty minutes height was charged from different sides and taken.<br>
<br>
Then commenced a rapid pursuit of fleeing Indians, who abandoned their spare horses, ammunition, and camp materials.  The hostiles struck for the thick pines which crest the blue ridge, and again made a stand, using the trees for defenses.<br>
<br>
Again the cavalry pressed them in front and on the flank, and in a few minutes dislodged them a third time and pushed them four or five miles farther in the mountains.  The rough country and great exhaustion of horses and men caused a cessation of the pursuit, for today.  In the battle five enlisted men were wounded, and probably twenty horses killed.  The enemy's losses in killed and wounded is difficult to tell.  Their women and children and best horses in drove were well out of the way before the battle began, seemingly toward the Grand Ronde.  The flight is in that direction.  Captain Bernard is entitled to special credit for this engagement, as indeed for the entire campaign, and his officers and men have done as well as brave and true men can do.
Could you know the difficulties of this wilderness you would then appreciate their loyal service.<br>

Your dispatches of yesterday are received and give great satisfaction.

If the regular troops can drive the Indians from chosen positions, and break them up into smaller parties, the people of the country can help very materially in capturing them in detail.  I understood 2,000 muskets has been issued to the Territory of Idaho, and 1,000 to Oregon, <B>whilst none have been applied for by Washington Territory.  That Territory is entitled to 2,000 muskets.</B>  These it seems to me are enough for defensive purposes as well as offensive in aid of the regular troops.

Painter of Walla Walla was elected Captain; Dr. J.M. Boyd, First Lieutenant; and Frank B. Morse, Second Lieutenant.  The 96 men comprising the company were from Walla Walla, Pendleton and Pilot Rock.  The company was organized at Walla Walla on July 14th and was disbanded on 26 August 1878.  The primary mission of the company was to prevent the hostiles from crossing the Columbia. About one-half of the company was detailed on the Steamboat "Spokane" patrolling the Columbia.  Captain Painter for his efficient leadership was shortly afterward appointed Lieutenant
Colonel and Aide-de-Camp to Governor Ferry.  The following is a complete roster of the Company:<br>

Following just received, dated Walla Walla, today:<br>
<br>
"Learning that there was signs of Indians moving on the VanSycle Canyon road to Wallula, yesterday, at 2:15 P.M., I ordered the cavalry column enroute to Lewiston, under Forsyth, to turn back and go quietly to Wallula to head off any movements of hostiles in that direction.  Reports reached me unofficially, at 6 P.M., that troops were fighting near Cayuse Station.  I sent couriers to overtake Forsyth and turn him to his left toward Pendleton to Mile's aid.  I also at the same time sent courier to Sanford, ninety miles away, to push to Cayuse Station, some fifty miles from him.  ln absence of commanding general, who is probably in or near Lewiston today, I start at once to assume general direction of the three columns until further orders."<br>

<br>
"Hostiles reported to be moving from their position near head of McKay's Creek.  I had expected to attack them early tomorrow morning, when Sanford would be in vicinity of Meacham's.  I sent Forsyth with cavalry column in quick pursuit and follow him with Mile's column.  McBean, Umatilla interpreter, with Umatilla scouts accompanies the troops.  Forty-six Umatilla scouts are now fighting Bannock's raiding party, and Snake Chief Egan, is reported to be killed.  Headmen here believe he is dead.  I do not doubt the authenticity of the report."<br>

<br>
FROM SLADEN, AIDE, TO ASST ADJ GEN, DIVISION PACIFIC:<br>
<br>
Following condensed from telegram received last night, dated camp near Meacham's, on Blue Mountains, 12 midnite, 16 July:  Situation tonight is as follows:  the movement Sanford's cavalry and Nez Perce scouts to this point from LaGrande, while main columns were advancing from the north, evidently caused a panic among the hostiles.  The trail from the hostiles - the trail from this point is strewn for six miles with large quantities of provisions and, to them, valuable supplies.  They had not time to gather and run off their many ponies scattered throughout the country.  At my request, ninety-seven Umatillas came this morning to help whip the Bannocks and Snakes.  They brought in the head of Chief Egan for identification, and ten scalps.  Sent them this evening, with three white scouts, to intercept the hostiles' trail eight miles southwest of us.  They think two hostile trails end toward the head of Grand Ronde or Powder River, though they may join hostiles halt at head of McKay's Creek.  Have ordered Forsyth's cavalry to follow Umatillas in morning.  Will move Mile's Infantry and Artillery column south or west as direction hostiles may require.  Egbert, now at LaGrande, will be held ready to go south to Powder River.  Have sent Sanford to mouth Wolf Creek.  Seven teamsters killed on this road during five days.<br>
"WHEATON"<br>
<br>
Also following received same time:  LaGrande, 18 July, at 5 P.M. yesterday:  Forsyth's cavalry column reached Starkey's ranch, on Daley's road, following 93 Umatillas, who were in charge of three white scouts.  At 1:15 this morning I learn by courier that at 2 P.M. yesterday the Umatillas struck the trail of the hostiles twenty miles beyond Starkey's ranch; direction of trail then toward head of Birch Creek.  At 7 P.M., yesterday the hostiles were believed to be about twenty miles ahead of the Umatillas.  I have ordered the cavalry column to follow them.  At 11:20 this morning I received the following from Forsyth:  He moved from Starkey's in evening leaving his pack train at Starkey's ranch, within two or two and half miles, he found the Umatillas, and camped on hostile's trail; they had overtaken them at that point, charged them, killed seventeen bucks, captured twenty-five women and children, and sixty to seventy head of stock.  Umatillas' only loss, two ponies.  They report the hostiles are breaking up into small parties and getting off as fast as possible.  Captured Piute squaws say the hostiles intended to try and make their way over into Weiser country, and thence to Bannock or Buffalo country.  The death of Egan evidently demoralized them; they started to escape immediately after it occurred.  Umatillas had their fight in vicinity of east fork of Birch Creek.  Forsyth, with his cavalry moves on at 7, this morning.  If the hostiles are breaking up into little bands as reported, and as is expected, it will be useless to start Mile's infantry column to follow cavalry.  I may be able to so dispose of the foot troops
as to prevent any organized bands of hostiles moving with large herds toward the Weiser country.  I will probably learn today whether to hold Mile's column about here, guarding passes in this vicinity, or to move it farther south or southeast.  The Umatillas have probably jaded their horses, and returned with their trophies to their reservation.<br>
<br>
I will push Sanford, with his squadron and Nez Perce scouts, west to Granite Creek Pass, to cooperate with Forsyth and to intercept any bands of hostiles coming that way enroute to Weiser.  I had ordered Sanford to mouth of Wolf Creek, where he now is.  I will notify Egbert and Wagner of situation and supposed intention of hostiles to scatter into small parties and get back to Weiser country.  I have guards at Cayuse, Meachem's and Pelican, and will escort mail-coaches from LaGrande to Umatilla agency until road is safe.<br>

(VIA BAKER CITY, OREGON<br>
29 July 1878)<br>
<br>
The crisis of the campaign has certainly passed.  The check of the Columbia serves to keep the peace north of that river.  The Bannock and Piutes fleeing southward have not fully separated, but divided their trails and run over the roughest mountain country.  I am moving my troops so as to pick the hostiles up in detail or drive them to the reservation, following any considerable number as fast as possible.  Forsyth has eight companies of cavalry here and Green three near mouth of Weiser today.  Crook has been telegraphed of eastward flight of the Indians, and asked to watch that they do not slip on reservation and escape arrest.<br>
<br>
HOWARD, BRIGADIER GENERAL<br>
<br>
In other telegrams and correspondence to the General, Commanding the Division of the Pacific at Presidio of San Francisco, General Howard informed all during August and September of small groups surrendering at the various Indian agencies.  For the most part they dealt with the disposition of the Indians who did not surrender at their own agency.  He recommended that those who had
joined in the war be either shipped away to Indian Territory or to the Lummi Agency on Puget Sound.<br>
<br>
During the foregoing campaign, settlers in the vicinity of Goldendale fled to that city for protection in the event the hostile Indians infiltrated north of the Columbia River.  However, the trouble was over in two months and they were back again in their homes with but little loss.  During this time, a company of mounted riflemen was organized with Enock W. Pike elected Captain (Later was Colonel of Second Regiment, NGW) The Governor furnished the company rifles and ammunition and they were thoroughly drilled.  This is reputed to be the first company of Militia organized under the Militia Laws of Washington Territory (1863).  They were known as the "Klickitat Rangers," but were never called into service as Captain Painter's company was.<br>
<br>
In closing the curtain on the last major Indian Wars of the Northwest, it is felt that those loyal, courageous and outstanding individuals who played a major role in bringing them to a successful conclusion, should be perpetuated in the military history of Washington through the publication of their biographies.  Accordingly, the biographies of these, not listed elsewhere in this or the preceding chapter, are as follows:<br>

He was awarded the MEDAL OF HONOR on 16 September 1897 for most distinguished gallantry in action at White Bird Canyon, Idaho on 17 June 1877 when he saved the life of a soldier.  The troop, under his command, was retreating through this canyon, pursued by a largely superior force of Indians, and while crossing a marsh a Trooper's horse was killed and its rider left in the tule swamp.  Lieutenant Parnell with a few men, returned, extricated the man and rescued him, in the face of very heavy fire and at imminent peril.  The loss to Troop H, First Cavalry was 14 killed and one wounded out of 54 officers and men taken into the action.<br>
<br>
In this same action MICHAEL MC CARTHY, First Sergeant of Troop H, First Cavalry was also awarded the MEDAL OF HONOR.  Born in Newfoundland in 1847 he enlisted in the First Cavalry on 3 November 1865.  He served continuously in this regiment being promoted to Corporal, Sergeant, Quartermaster Sergeant, First Sergeant and Regimental Quartermaster Sergeant.

He was retired on 27 August 1895.  He was appointed Adjutant General of the Washington National Guard by the Governor following his retirement and served in that capacity until 13 January 1897.  Advanced on the Retired list to the grade of Colonel, he served as Recruiting Officer for the Army in Seattle for many years.  He died in 1924 in Seattle.<br>
<br>
Before concluding this Chapter on the last major Indian War in the Northwest, it is believed that your compiler make some attempt to differentiate between the meaning of the words "Volunteers" and "Militia" which are used frequently throughout this history and which if not clarified might leave the impression with the reader that these terms are synonymous.  This can best be accomplished through use of some "Digests of Opinions" of the Judge Advocate General of the Army.  In this manner it is also believed that some of the controversial statements made by past historians regarding "Volunteers" of the Indian Wars of the Northwest may be once and for all settled and the true status of Washington Territory participants therein determined.<br>
<br>
The following opinions of the Judge Advocate General are quoted in connection therewith:<br>
<br>
"1724.  The President has no original authority over the militia by right of his office.  He can only call them out when Congress provides for his doing so as the agent of the United States for such purpose.  When the call is complied with, the militia
becomes national militia, and he becomes their commander-in-
chief.  ******* December 1891.<br>
<br>
"1725.  The calling forth of the militia into the U.S. service is an administrative function, a ministerial act, in which the Secretary of War may issue the necessary orders as the organ of the Executive; and his act is the act of the President. *****August 1893.<br>
<br>
"1728.  In 1836 an Indian agent in Indiana applied for assistance, in an emergency, to a militia colonel who furnished three companies of his regiment, which were employed and rendered faithful service for seven days in assisting to execute the laws of the United States.  Upon a claim now (1893) made for compensation for such service, HELD that the same could not legally be allowed by the Secretary of War, who could have no authority to recognize, as in the U.S. service, militia who had not been called out by the President or by his direction; and that such claim could be entertained by Congress alone. **** July 1893."<br>
<br>
"1744.  Many militia organizations have been paid by the United States under acts of Congress which provided for the payment of such only of the militia as served in Indian wars in response to calls from the President.  Where money so appropriated has been paid to a particular militia organization, a decision was probably made by some one at the time that the organization was in the service of the United States; otherwise the payment would not have been made.  Such payment is a strong indication of what the understanding of the Government authorities was at the time. If it is the only evidence that can be found as to what the understanding was and the records of the organization show nothing either way on the main question, ie, whether the organization was in the service of the State or of the United States, it alone should be held sufficient to decide the matter. If, however, there is other evidence, the payment referred to should be considered with it in determining whether the organization was in fact in the service of the United States or of the State or Territory.  These conclusions do not apply in the case of "volunteers" as the term is commonly used, but care should be taken not to treat a militia organization as volunteers because it bore the name of volunteers at the time.  Organizations have some times borne the name volunteers when the facts and circumstances connected with their organization and service showed clearly that they were only State militia called into the service of the United States. *** May 1894"<br>
<br>
In view of the foregoing "opinions", it must be concluded by your compiler that:<br>
<br>
     a.  The companies of the First Regiment of Washington Volunteers organized for United States service at Fort Steilacoom (Company B) and at Fort Vancouver (Company B) in 1855 by Acting Governor Mason at the request of Major Rains were not legally
entitled to the status of "Volunteers", but were "Territorial Militia" mustered into the service of the United States.  The balance of the First Regiment not called into U.S. service were "Territorial Militia" called into the service of Washington Territory.<br>
<br>
b.  The individuals comprising the companies of the Second Regiment, Washington "Volunteers" were not legally entitled to the status of "Volunteers" but were "Territorial Militia" ordered into the service of Washington Territory.<br>
<br>
c.  The Washington Territorial Militia serving during the Nez Perce War of 1877 and the Bannock Indian War of 1878, organized under Washington Territorial laws, and referred to as "Volunteers" were actually "Territorial Militia" mustered into United States service by General Howard as the authorized agent of the Secretary of War.<br>
<br>
d.  Neither Governor Stevens or Acting Governor Mason were authorized agents of the Secretary of War or the President for ordering "Militia" into the service of the United States, but, were duly authorized under the "Organic Act" creating Washington Territory, to order them into the service of the Territory.<br>

THE BANNOCK INDIAN WAR OF 1878<br>
<br>
Fred Lockley, "The Bannock Indian War of 1878," <B>History of the Columbia River Valley from The Dalles to the Sea.</B> Chicago: S.J. Clarke, 1928, I, p. 961-65.<br>
<br>
Samuel Gill has lived in Portland since the spring of 1875.  He was born in England, September 16, 1853, and came to th@ United States when he was two years old.<br>
<br>
"Some time ago you published an interview with Gen.  John A. Kress in reference to his experiences in the Bannock Indian war," said Mr. Gill.  "I myself had a rather interesting experience in the Bannock war.  It was fifty years ago, or to be exact, in June, 1878, that I was serving as engineer on the steamer Almota on the upper Columbia River.<br>
<br>
"We were engaged in transporting wool from the landing near where the town of Arlington is today to Celilo.  We finished handling the wool early in July and then spent two days in scalding out the freight room of the boat.  As the boat was to go into regular service, I was ordered to report at the company's shop at The Dalles.<br>
<br>
"I had been hoping to come to Portland for a vacation, but on arriving at The Dalles on the evening of July 3, I was ordered to
get busy putting the steamer Idaho in condition for a Sunday school picnic from The Dalles to Hood River on the Fourth.  We sailed away from the wharf boat at The Dalles about 9 o'clock.  After a pleasant day at the village of Hood River we started on our return trip, the boat being in command of Capt.  Fred Wilson.<br>
<br>
On our way we called at Moster's to put off a few passengers.  Unfortunately, the boat ran aground and a couple of hours were consumed in getting her off.  Finally getting afioat, we proceeded a mile or two and landed at Husbands, where there was a repetition of getting aground and more delay, so that we arrived at The Dalles about midnight.<br>
<br>
A large company of the townspeople were down at the wharf boat to meet us.  We were surprised to learn that they feared that our delay might have been caused by our capture by the Indians.<br>
<br>
"James Smith, foremen at the Oregon Steam Navigation Company's shop, was waiting at the wharf and said to me, 'You are to go at once to Celilo.  The locomotive is waiting to take you there.  Never mind this boat, we will take care of her in the mo@ng.' We left at about 2 A. M. of the fifth, arriving at Celilo at about 3 o'clock.  My orders were to get the steamer Spokane ready for a military expedition.  Soldiers from Vancouver were to arrive at 6 A. M. of the sixth.<br>
<br>
"I found the boat in winter laid up condition, engines pretty thoroughly disconnected and boiler empty.  At breakfast at the mess house I found a Mr. Stockham, who had been sent out the previous afternoon.  He was from Sacramento.  He knew nothing about a steamboat, never having been on one before in his life.  We were very busy all day and in the afternoon, when a portage train was starting back to The Dalles, I told the  conductor,  Neal  McFarland, to bring me out an engine room crew in the morning when he brought the soldiers.<br>
<br>
"At about 9:30 we were aroused, with the news that the Indians were between The Dalles and Celilo.  A train on its way out had proceeded but two or three miles from The Dalles -when the engineer, Johnny Carey, imagined he saw Indians lurking among the bushes near the tracks, and the train immediately returned to The Dalles, where a force of citizens was gathered, armed with rifles and mounted aboard the train to proceed again to Celilo to give battle to any Indian they might find on the way.<br>
<br>
An order had come to Celilo from the company agent at The Dalles, J. S. Schenck, to gather everybody in Celilo, send them down
aboard the Spokane and transport them across the rivdr to the Washington shore.  The only families in Celilo were the Murphys, with two or three small children, and John Anderson the engineer's wife and baby, and George Erskine and wife, who were the keepers of the mess house.<br>
<br>
There were probably fifty mechanics and workmen employed in the boatyard building a boat, which I believe was the Harvest Queen.  Most of these people were gathered on the deck of the boat.  The men were excited and the children were crying, for they thought the Indians might come at any moment.  While I was trying to get up steam on the boat, Dave Clapp, the company watchman at Celilo, who was to serve was navigator of the Spokane across the river to the Washington shore, gave me the signal to go ahead.<br>
<br>
We didn't have steam enough to operate the engines and one of the men called out that we were drifting down the river toward the falls.  I called up through the speaking tube and said, 'What do you want?' Clapp responded, 'Go ahead, or we will be over the falls if you don't.' We drifted down some distance, however, before there was steam enough to overcome the current and proceed to the Washington shore.<br>
<br>
Major Kress, with his command of about twenty of the Ordnance Corps and a few musicians, arrived at 6 o'clock in the morning of July 6. All of the other soldiers had left Vancouver with General Howard.<br>
<br>
With Major Kress were Governor S. F. Chadwick of Oregon, Governor Perry of Washington and Capt.  W. P. Gray, who was to have command of the boat.  The soldiers began coming aboard, bringing their plunder, and in their outfit was a Gatling gun, a new invention reputed to fire 480 shots a minute.  I went, out on the wharf and found the above mentioned officials, together with Billy McDonald, the company's agent, and McFarland, the conductor, discussing plans.<br>
<br>
On looking about and seeing no evidence of a crew for my assistance in the engine room I asked McFarland where my men were, and he said, 'Sam, I was so busy with Indians and raids that I didn't have time to attend to your matter.' I immediately told them where they could go to and what they could do with the boat, and that I was through with the expedition.<br>
<br>
They urged me not to desert them at this critical time, when men, women and children up the country were being massacred by the Indians.  Perhaps the humor of the situation overcame my wrath, and I consented to go.  We departed with Captain Gray, Mate Dave Clapp, Engineer Gill, Fireman Stockham, and Tom Monohan, a
seventeen-year-old boy, as watchman and lamp trimmer.<br>
<br>
Among the arguments that induced me to go was this: 'You can get some of the deckhands to help you out, Sam.' But there wasn't a deckhand on the boat.  We four men and boy constituted the crew, no cook, no steward, no provisions or supplies.  Fortunately the army brought along some hardtack, beans, bacon, and coffee.<br>
<br>
Under the direction of Sergeant Connors, the soldiers cooked breakfast on the boat's galley range.<br>
<br>
"On our way up the river we stopped at several landings and took aboard some skiffs and rowboats to prevent the Indians making use of them in their anticipated attempt to cross the river.  Along in the evening about 8 o'clock a soldier came aft to the engine room with an invitation from Major Kress for me to come forward and witness the operation of the Gatling gun.<br>
<br>
"The boat was then running alongside of Long Island, and the gun was directed at two or three rabbits on the sandy beach.  The bullets made the sand fly, but whether we destroyed any rabbits, I don't know.  Perhaps the navigator in the pilot house was so busy watching the operation of the gun that he neglected the control of the boat for a moment, and her stern swung in toward the beach.<br>
<br>
"Anyway, the wheel met with some obstruction, which broke it badly and crowded some of the fragments over into contact withthe eccentric rods of the starboard engine, carrying them away and rendering the boat helpless.  Fortunately, by getting Ihe anchor out and fast to a hawser we came to anchor.  With the aid of some of the soldiers, we detached some of the injured parts of the machinery, went ashore on the island with cordwood from the fuel of the boat, built a fire, and proceeded to heat the bent eccentric rods and straighten them out.<br>
<br>
"It was 3 o'clock in the morning of the seventh when we were able to proceed on our way to Umatilla, the wheel being in a very weak and shattered condition, but we eventually arrived at our destination and found the company agent, J. H. Kunzie, anxiously awaiting our arrival.<br>
<br>
"I learned that there was a blacksmith shop out in the sagebrush four or five blocks away and on investigation I found facilities forfioing some blacksmith work-coal for fuel, blacksmith tools ,,gad an old forge.  I got a fire going and with some tools from the boat repaired the bent yvheel rings and made some bolts and iron-work for the wheel.  In t@e meantime the soldiers were
engaged, as instructed by me, in replacing the broken wheel arms and paddle boards.  This took all day.<br>
<br>
"The next morning we learned that the Indians had been crossing the river at Long Island during the night, and we went after them.  On arriving about midway of the island, which is about eighteen miles long, we discovered evidences of the Indians having passed that way.  The boat landed and a detachment of soldiers was sent ashore to reconnoiter.<br>
<br>
"They discovered where the Indians had cached a lot of their plunder, and they captured an old Indian, a squaw and a baby, whom they brought aboard the boat.  Sergeant Connors was ordered to cross the island, which was about a mile wide at this place, and we meanwhile would proceed down to the foot of the island and up the channel between the island and the Washington shore.<br>
<br>
"We found the soldiers waiting for us and took them aboard.  We had to find a landing on the Washington Shore, and it was necessary for us to land where there were a number of projecting rocks in the river, an unexplored location where no boats had been before.  No sooner had we run the boat's nose on the beach than from the cliffs close by on the river bank, and about 100 feet high, the Indians opened fire on the boat, which we at once returned.<br>
<br>
"We went up the river io Wallula, where we found the steamer Northwest.  Capt.  M. C. Wilkenson, aide-de-camp of Gen. 0. 0. Howard, was on board with a lot of volunteer soldiers, consisting largely of cowboys and farmers from the vicinity of Walla Walla.  We turned over half of our soldiers to him in exchange for about half of his cowboys and farm. ers.<br>
<br>
"This gave us an armed force of sixty men.  We came down the river to Long Island and landed some of our men on the Washington shore.  They climbed up a canyon to the top of the cliffs but failed to find any Indians.  The Indians were supplied with Winchester rifles.<br>
<br>
"Our men were using Springfield pin-fire guns.  The soldiers had piled bales of wool around the pilot house as a protection to the officer in the pilot house.  They also made a barricade of bales of wool to protect me in the engine house.  I preferred to be killed by an Indian bullet rather than by the heat and the smell of the wool, so I had them take it away.<br>
<br>
"The temperature in the engine room was at least 135 degrees, and
the sun beat down unmercifully on the deck of the engine room.  'After a short search the soldiers came back to the boat and we decided to <B>go </B>back to Umatilla.  As we backed out into the river the Indians, who had been hidden among the rocks, fired at us.<br>
<br>
"On the morning of the ninth, we went down the river to the mouth of Willow Creek.  On our way back that afternoon, just above Thanksgiving Island, our lookout discovered a band of Indians, with their horses, coming around the hillside on the Washington shore, about a mile distant.<br>
<br>
"At this point there were several rounded buttes that came down to the river's edge.  The Indians were on the side of one of these buttes.  They were undoubtedly hurrying home to their reservation, as the Indians had been ordered to report to their reservations. or be considered renegades.  We blew the whistle as a signal for the Indians to come down to the bank of the river for a consultation.<br>
<br>
"Evidently they did not know what we wanted, for instead of coming down to the river bank, they hid in a draw between two of the hills.  The Gatling gun had just been invented@d had never been used in action against an enemy, So the Gatling gun was put into action to smoke the Indians out.  It certainly made the dust fly around those Indians.<br>
<br>
"The Indians did not regard this as a very friendly action and instead of coming to the shore for a consultation they hid back of the rocks and tried to get away.  The boat was landed and some of our men sent ashore to get the Indians.  Several of the horses had been wounded and several others, while not wounded, had blood on their backs, showing that their riders had been either killed or wounded.<br>
<br>
"The men brought in about seventy horses, which they drove on board the boat.  The Indians did not realize that they were simply try-<br>
ing the Gatling gun out, and, resenting the fact that several of their band had been killed, they stopped at the home of the Perkins family on The Dalles-Yakima Road and killed the members of this family.<br>
<br>
"The Indians we had killed with the Gatling gun were not hostile Indians, but were friendly Yakima Indians hurrying home to their reservation as ordered.  I think they killed the same number of white men.that we had killed of their number.  Later some of the head men of the Yakima tribe were held as hostages and I believe eventually the Indians who had killed the Perkins family gave up,
were tried and executed.  This brush with our Gatling gun against the Yakimas was the third and last engagement of the naval part of the Bannock Indian war.<br>
<br>
"We continued patrolling the river from the mouth of Willow Creek up the Columbia to about forty miles above the mouth of the Snake River.  After I had been on*duty eight days, Engineer Dave Pardun came to my relief.  I certainly had a busy time getting the Spokane ready for service.  I had started at 4 o'clock in the morning on July 4 getting the Idaho ready for her trip to Hood River.  Immediately upon my return from Hood River I went to work on the Spokane.  I put in eighty-four hours, during which time I slept but two hours.<br>
<br>
"I frequently met Major Kress, who later became a general, on the streets of Portland.  Sergeant Connors remained at Vancouver until he retired, and he died and was buried in Vancouver.  General Kress received the Distinguished Service Cross for extraordinary heroism in military operations against an armed enemy of the United States near Umatilla, Ore., on July 8, 1878.<br>
<br>
Major Kress, in reporting to Captain Sladen at Vancouver Barracks, said  "Capt.  Charles Painter with his forty-two volunteers from Walla Walla deserves praise for good conduct and bravery.  Also the Vancouver regulars and Captain.  Gray with the officers and crew of the steamer Spokane, who stood at their post under fire.'<br>
<br>
"My only other connection with the Bannock war was in December, 1878.  The renegade Cayuses and Bannocks were brought to The Dalles under cavalry escort to await transfer across the Columbia on their way to, the Yakima' reservation.  Although the weather was cold, the young Indian braves between the ages of eighteen and thirty went about almost naked.<br>
<br>
"They were unruly and required constant control.  The process of transferring them to the Washington side consisted of sending down a number of wagons with Indians and their supplies to the company wharf boat, where they were loaded on the steamer Mountain Queen and ferried across the river.<br>
<br>
"I was engineer of the Mountain Queen and it took three days to put all the Indians across.  We finished the job on Saturday eve-
ning and on Sunday morning I heard the bugle sound and the entire company took up their march to the Yakima reservation."<br>

BANNOCK INDIAN WAR.<br>
<br>
Frederick A. Mark, "The Bannock Indian War of 1878," <B>Great Western Indian fights</B> by the Members of the Potomac Corral of the Westerners, Washington D. C. Garden City, New York: Doubleday and Company, 1960. 270-280.<br>
<br>
From a dozen camp fires scattered among the Bannock lodges at the head of a small aspen-fringed mountain valley, the smoke curled lazily into the clear, crisp sky one spring morning in 1878.  The face of Buffalo Horn, chief of the Bannocks, was solemn as he stepped from his tepee and gazed east onto Camas Prairie below him.<br>
<br>
With field glasses be bad retained from his scouting duty with General Howard in the Nez Perce campaign the year before, he scanned the prairie before him for traces of the white man's cattle trespassing on the sacred camas ground of his tribe.  While he stood there, lean and tall, his intelligent face hardened as he observed the breakfast smoke of cattlemen's camps.<br>
<br>
Buffalo Horn was determined not to give up Camas Prairie, which his tribe had used since historic times and had reserved with the Portneuf lands in the treaty with the United States Government at Fort Bridger in 1867, even though some ignorant clerk had erroneously substituted the name Kansas for Camas.<br>
<br>
Buffalo Horn had visited Fort Boise a few days before, and on the basis of his good reputation and excellent military service as a scout under several military commanders against the Nez Perce and Sioux, he had been authorized an issue of ammunition by the Territorial Governor.<br>
<br>
His plan of battle was clear in his mind.  He would not make the mistakes of Nez Perce Joseph and Sitting Bull.  He had little respect for the tactics of the Army's commanders.<br>

Buffalo Horn's mind was made up.  The injustices of the white man would be tolerated no longer.  His son and another Indian mounted their ponies and rode out upon the prairie.  Soon they came to the cattle camp of three white men who were herding part of the twenty-five hundred head of cattle.  By the time the young braves arrived at the cattle camp the sun shone with brilliance on the snowy heights of Soldier Mountain behind them and on the ragged Sawtooth Mountains to the north.<br>
<br>
On the pretext of trading a buffalo robe, they parleyed with the white men, then suddenly shot Lou Kemler and George Nesby.  The two wounded men made their escape on horses; the other man,<br>
William Silvey, escaped into the brush and later found a horse to<br>
hasten his departure.<br>
<br>
The wounded men met two freighters, who relayed the news of the attack to a rancher, who delivered the message to Fort Boise.  The attack was not unexpected, since Captain R. F. Bernard at that post had already received orders from General Howard at Vancouver, and was on his way to Camas Prairie to quell anticipated trouble from the Indians.<br>
<br>
It was already known the Malheur and Umatilla Indians were in concert with the Bannocks and that war was imminent.<br>
<br>
In the meantime, Buffalo Horn was having trouble in his own camp.  Chief Tendoy, one of his band, was against war and, taking some of his warriors, women, and children, had left for his reservation on Lemhi River.  Buffalo Horn felt that he had ample reason to go to war, since his band was on short rations, and the agent was being investigated for shipping Indian supplies to Eastern relatives.<br>
<br>
Indians to the westward were making evident preparations for war.  Eagle Eye of the Weiser tribe, took rations at his supply point, the Malheur Agency, and headed east.  The next day, the Malheur Paiutes under Chief Egan departed from the reservation with forty-six Bannocks.  Their trail led southeast.<br>
<br>
Conditions on the Malheur reservation were even worse than those on the reservations in Idaho Territory.  The Indians accused the new agent, Rinehart, of harsh and inhuman treatment and starvation rations.  While there was much to be desired from the politically appointed agents, the principal fault was that of Congress, with its years of failure to promptly ratify treaties made with the Indians, and its meager appropriations for support of the reservation.
Chief Egan had a reputation for being a pleasant, industrious, and courteous Indian.  He was respected by the military authorities.  He consented to lead the hostiles as Chief only after threats<br>
against him by the Paiutes.<br>
<br>
On June 2 Captain Bernard arrived on Camas Prairie, and his cavalry forced Buffalo Horn and his hostiles into the lava beds near the head of Clover Creek.  Buffalo Horn soon broke away and descended from the hills to the Overland Road on Snake River, near King Hill, where he plundered freight wagons and improved his supply of ammunition and arms.<br>
<br>
Passing down the river about five miles, the hostiles crossed at Glenns Ferry, then cut the ferry adrift.<br>
<br>
Major Patrick Collins, now in command of Bernard's column, followed the hostiles to the mouth of the Bruneau, finding en route the bodies of John Bascom and two other men killed by the Indians.  Meanwhile, the Territorial Governor and Generals Crook and Howard were preparing military orders to place enough volunteers and troops in the field to cut off the hostiles before they reached their allies in Oregon.  In this they failed.<br>
<br>
The hostiles passed up Bruneau River, killing settlers found in their way.  Bruneau John, an Indian friendly to the settlers, had preceded the hostiles to the valley and warned the ranchers. Large numbers of settlers fortified themselves in a four-room dugout on Robinson's ranch.  Fletcher Haws and Jack Sweeney were not so fortunate; they were caught on the range and killed.<br>
<br>
Major Collins returned to Fort Boise, and Captain Bernard again took command.  He followed the hostiles, now numbering three hundred or more, over the divide to the headwaters of Owyhee River.  On June 8 Colonel Robbin's scouts, proceeding ahead of Bernard, located the hostiles' camp on Battle Creek.  At the same time, Captain Harper with some twenty volunteers approached from Silver City and engaged the Indians.<br>
<br>
In a running battle, a part of Harper's volunteers bolted, and the group were barely escaped annihilation.  The volunteers fled after four shot from their horses and killed.  But in the engagement Buffalo Horn was killed.  Credited as being a gallant fighter, he was shot at close range, screamed, and fell from his horse.<br>
<br>
General Howard arrived at Fort Walla from Vancouver June 9; and after conferring with Colonel Wheaton, the commanding officer,
departed hastily for Boise.<br>
<br>
By June 18 Howard had almost nine hundred troops in the field, most of which arrived overland from adjoining states and territories. The troops consisted of a column of foot troops under<br>
Major Joseph Stewart, Fourth Artillery; a column of three cavalry companies trader Captain Bernard, First Cavalry; a company under Captain Thomas McGregor proceeding from Camp Harney to join with Bernard; a column under Colonel C. Grover, First Cavalry, cons@g of cavalry and infantry units; a column of five companies of the Twelfth Infantry under Captain Harry Egbert; and two companies of the Fourth Artillery under Captain John Egan.<br>
<br>
By June 16 these columns had orders to move toward the enemy in the area around Steins Mountain, Oregon.  In the meantime, Captain John Bendire moved his troops from Fort Hall on Lincoln Creek to guard the Agency at Ross Fork.<br>
<br>
The hostile force had now effected a union with Egan's Malheurs, many of the Northern Paiutes, Eagle Eye's Weisers, some Shoshones, and probably some Umatillas.  Reports were rampant of ranch raiding and lulling of setters in the Stein's Mountain area, an extremely rough, barren, and inaccessible region even to this day.<br>
<br>
Replenishing  his  supplies  at  Silver  City,  Bernard,  the   colorful cavalry captain, was again in the saddle pressing hard to the west over broken wasteland toward Stein's Mountain in Oregon.  General Howard had left his advance headquarters on Winnimucca Road and was following Bernard, his progress greatly slowed down with supply wagons.<br>
<br>
Bernard's cavalry companies and nine howitzers moved fast.  On June 21 he drew rations at Camp Harney and proceeded forty-five miles west near a point on Silver Creek, where scouts had located the hostiles.  The Indians had now consolidated their force into eight hundred or more warriors, with their women and children moving before them.<br>
<br>
At Silver Creek Bernard made contact with the hostiles.  Approaching their camp unobserved June 23 at eight o'clock in the morning, he formed his column about four hundred yards from the Indian camp and advised his troops that any found retreating would be shot and that they might just as well be killed by the Indians as by their friends.  With these words, and others more encouraging, he attacked.<br>

The troops were outnumbered at least three to one but the Indians<br>
immediately withdrew into the crags behind them, which were inaccessible to the mounted cavalrymen.  Bernard re-formed his lines twice and charged, but be could not dislodge the hostiles.<br>
<br>
Three cavalrymen were lulled and three wounded.  Bernard now requested reinforcements.  General Howard, with his troops, arrived on June 25.<br>
<br>
In the interim the Indians withdrew northward and crossed the divide to the John Day River.  Small parties were raiding ranches throughout the John Day country, killing all who came in their path, and driving large herds of cattle and horses before them.  The people of Canyon City were terrified.<br>
<br>
Bernard pressed forward at a fast pace while Howard was lumbering far behind with his wagons and infantry.<br>
<br>
The hostiles reached Fox Valley July 2.  Bernard's scouts were observing them while be waited for Howard's reinforcements.  The Indians had now chosen the high, craggy divide between the John Day and Grand Rivers as their line of advance, and Howard was forced to transfer his supplies to pack horses.<br>
<br>
Obviously, the hostiles intended to effect union with the Umatilla and Northern Columbia tribes before attempting a stand against<br>
Howard's columns.  On July 5 Howard and McGregor formed a 90<br>
junction at Pilot Rock with Colonel Wheaton's troops arriving from Fort Walla under the command of Captain C. B. Throckmorton, and a cavalry company from Fort Lapwai, Idaho territory, commanded by Captain W. H. Winters.<br>
<br>
Scouts located the hostiles on the north slope of the Blue Mountains near the divide between Butter and Birch Creeks.  Howard was fearful the Indians, then crossing the Columbia River, contemplated an assault on the Umatilla Agency and Pendleton.  Settlers had deserted the whole countryside around Pendleton.<br>
<br>
General Howard, accompanying Bernard's cavalry, rushed two columns forward at sunrise July 8. The advance on the hostiles was made over extremely rough terrain and heavy timber.  The Indians were attacked from several points, and in their hasty retreat they left tons of camp supplies and some abandoned their horses, in order to gain ground more inaccessible to the troops.<br>
<br>
The Indians were blasted from their positions and retreated to
higher ground.  They made a second stand on a higher ridge and<br>
fell back again before  withering fire of the troops. Howard now<br>
now continued his frontal attack with rushes from both flanks.<br>
<br>
The Indians hastily retired several miles into the mountains, and the troops stopped the assault because of the sheer exhaustion of men and animals.  The hostiles' women and children, proceeding ahead of the braves, were moving eastward toward the Grande Ronde valley.  Five enlisted men were wounded, and one died of his injuries.  Now nearly two thousand Indian malcontents were in the vicinity.<br>
<br>
Advance bands of Egan's hostiles were reported crossing the Columbia River below Umatilla on July 8. The Bannocks and Paiutes offered the Umatillas two thousand horses in return for assistance, advising they would need no help once they crossed the Columbia.  The Umatillas refused and the hostiles fired on them, killing several.<br>
<br>
In the vicinity of Willow Springs, a group of fifty white volun-
teers were attacked and five were killed.  After posting troops to guard all trails leading to the Snake and Salmon Rivers, to pre-
vent further northward movement of the hostiles, Howard departed for Lewiston and the mouth of the Grande Ronde.  Captain Bernard started overland to prevent movement of the Indians over the Lolo and Nez Perce trails into Montana territory.<br>
<br>
But new and unexpected fighting was still to take place.  On July 10 the hostiles descended from the mountains and destroyed the Cayuse station on the stage road between Le Grande and Pendleton.  Getting word of this new attack, the Indian Agent t Umatilla sent word to the troops near Alta, some eighteen miles away, urging them to defend the Agency.<br>
<br>
About four o'clock the same afternoon, George Coggan was killed, and Alfred Bunker was wounded, then burned alive, by the hostiles.  Traveling all night the soldiers arrived at the agency at day light.While the troops were eating a well-earned breakfast, hostiles appeared at the edge of the clearing and, surprised to see troops there, hesitated.<br>
<br>
The <B>commanding</B> officer immediately deployed his men and opened fire on the hostiles.  He wondered if the Umatilla might join the hostiles; some did, but they raised a white flag before nightfall and surrendered.<br>
     
Bitter fighting continued  into  the  next  day  through  the  thickly wooded mountains. During the night the Umatillas offered aid to the commanding officer, a Captain Miles, but in the meantime the command passed into the hands of Colonel Wheaton, and the Umatillas on their own initiative took up pursuit of the hos-
tiles.<br>
<br>
Contacting Chief Egan, they advised him they had come to join his band.  While engaged in conversation with Egan and a few of his warriors, the Umatillas suddenly opened fire, killing Egan and several braves near him.<br>
<br>
Chief Egans head was later brought to the agency for identification.  The morale of the hostiles was now broken; both war chiefs were dead.  Breaking up into small bands, they dispersed to the east and south, and across the Columbia River.<br>
<br>
With this turn in events, Captain Bernard was ordered back to Umatilla.  Colonel Forsyth, freshly arrived from Chicago, pursued a band of hostiles south to the headwaters of the John Day River; and in exchanging fire with the band's rear guard, five soldiers received wounds and one volunteer was killed.<br>
<br>
River boats, heavily armed, patrolled the Columbia above and below Umatilla landing.  A few Indians were captured and large amounts of supplies were left on the banks by the hostiles when they were fired on.  The hostile Chief Moses, in the Yakima country, had trouble restraining his braves from actively engaging in the war.  Numerous depreciations were carried out by his tribesmen.<br>
<br>
At least one rancher and his wife were killed, and the warehouses at Priests Rapids on the Columbia were burned.  Yakima City organized a strong volunteer group and built strong blockhouses for defense.<br>
<br>
But the great crescent-shaped movement of the Indians bursting out of Idaho Territory and across Oregon had spent its force.  After traveling hundreds of miles, the hostiles now broke up into very small groups and headed eastward in a great fan-shaped pattern.  Reports of Indian movements came from Burnt River, the Wallowas, Powder River, and the Grande Ronde, indicating to General Howard that the hostiles were headed toward Central Idaho, Steins Mountain, the Snake, and Owyhee Rivers.<br>
<br>
Along the Salmon River small groups of hostiles were reported
threatening settlers and &erg on Chinese miners.  By mid-August Major Sanford and Captain Egbert had followed them back into <B><br>
</B>Southern Idaho Territory. At the mouth of Bennett Creek, a<br>
a tributary of Snake River, Captain Dove attacked a hundred hos-
tiles.<br>
<br>
Reinforced by Captain Egbert's column, the attack was resumed under cover of darkness and the Indians were driven into the lava beds.  Major Green moved east to the wild headwaters of the Lost and Salmon Rivers.  Indians had attacked a group of freighters near Lemhi Pass.  Green captured several squaws and a few horses.<br>
<br>
The commands of Egbert, Bernard, Sanford, and Drum were kept busy in late August and September rounding up small bands of Indians in the southern part of Idaho Territory.<br>
<br>
At Payette Lakes, near the center of the Territory, small bands of hostiles lulled five citizens.  In the extreme northeast comer of the Territory, a small band of Bannocks fired on Dr. F. V. Hay-
den's geological survey party and captured all their horses.  A few days later, Captain Egan recaptured fifty-six horses from a group of hostiles.<br>
<br>
In early September Colonel Nelson A. Miles, at Fort Ellis, Montana Territory, received orders to intercept a group of hostiles approaching either Boulder or Clarks Fork Pass.  With seventy-five cavalry and Crow scouts, Miles immediately departed for Clark's Fork Pass, some 115 miles away.<br>
<br>
Arriving at the pass scouts were placed at high points and the next day observed a band of hostiles approaching about twelve miles away.  They went into camp at noon six miles from Miles' concealed camp.  Approaching the Indians at daybreak Miles formed a line and attacked.  Eleven of the warriors were killed and most of the remainder captured.  Captain Bennett and one Crow scout were killed, and one soldier wounded.<br>
<br>
Other hostiles drifted into Wyoming Territory.  Near Wind River Lieutenant Bishop, Fifth Cavalry, captured some who escaped Miles.  Fifty miles northwest of Togwotee Pass on Dry Creek a tributary of Snake River, Bishop attacked a band of Bannocks on September 12.  One Indian was killed; five women, a few children, and eleven horses were captured.<br>

The Indian war was over.  Much to the displeasure of post commanders, Indian prisoners were held at several military posts from Fort Omaha to Fort Hall.  On Feb@ 10, 1879, Captain W. H. Winters delivered some six hundred Indian prisoners to Fort Simcoe, Washington.  Some were permitted to return to their old reservations during the next two years; others never got back.<br>
<br>
Although the war involved the military posts from the Platte to the Columbia, including regular troops and volunteers from a, half dozen states, the casualties, white and red, were relatively small.  Only nine soldiers were killed and 24 wounded.<br>
<br>
There were 24 citizens killed and 34 wounded, including those attached and not attached to troops.  There were 78 Indians reported killed and 66 wounded; however it is quite likely at least double that number were casualties.<br>
<br>
Compared to the Nez Perce War of 1876-77, in which 123 citizens and soldiers and 171 Indians lost their lives, it is evident the military commanders in the present struggle must have been sympathetic to the Bannock and Paiute cause.<br>
<br>
Their principal efforts were toward preventing the Indians from consolidating a large force in one place, and their operations were chiefly directed to "herding- the Indians rather than @g them.<br>
<br>
Following his inspection of the Fort Hall Reservation, just prior to the war in April 1878, General Crook stated:<br>
<br>
The apportionment of rations for the supply of this agency was ridiculously inadequate; the Indians complained that three days out of seven they had nothing to eat, and the agent told me the allowance had never been adequate.<br>
<br>
Crook added at a later date:<br>
<br>
...that it was no surprise...that some of the Indians soon afterward broke out into hostility, and the great wonder is that so many remained on the Reservation. With the Bannocks and Shoshones, our Indian policy has resolved itself into a question of war path or starvation, and being merely human, many of them will always choose the former alternative, where death shall at least be glorious.<br>
