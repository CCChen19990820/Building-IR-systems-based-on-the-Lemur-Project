<P><!--Budapest  Full of Character and Characters by Susan Milligan--> It's
tempting to take the easy way to the top in Budapest, plunking down less than a
dollar to ride the funicular to the height of the city's ancient and charming
Castle District.  But if you walk instead, up a winding series of stone
stairways, you will not miss the glorious views of the Danube at the city's
spectacular bridges, connecting busy, flat Pest with green, hilly Buda. 
Besides, the 20-minute hike will make you appreciate all the more the warm,
flaky pastry and rich, milky tejeskave (coffee with milk) at the 168 year old
Ruszwurm cafe.<BR></P>
<P>There, you can plan your day, which may begin with several more hours at
breakfast.  In Hungary's emerging, newly entrepreneurial city, one right is
inalienable: spending an entire afternoon in one of the city's inspiring cafes. 
Here one can read, watch the passing crowd, write a novel that never gets
published, and eat as many gargantuan pastries as the stomach desires, all
without any reproachful or impatient looks from the serving staff.   
<BR></P>
<P>Budapest likes to consider itself the Paris of the East, a moniker that is
at least partly enduring.  For Budapestians, moving unstoppingly toward a market
economy (despite 1994's re-election of the Socialists), this is no longer
Eastern Europe; it's Central Europe.  Different address, never moved.  That
change in many ways defines the contradiction of Budapest in 1995:  there is
still a maddening bureaucracy that frustrates family and business life, yet the
city's downtown carries the high paced, professional air of a Western city. 
There are new coins, but most street phones take only old coins. Stocky gypsy
women in black-and-red skirts sell flowers and trinkets next to the Clinique
cosmetics shop on tony Vaci utca; traditional old Hungarian restaurants serving
up chicken paprika are situated across the street from New York Bagel. 
<BR></P>
<P>This is a city full of character and characters.  The prime minister, Gyula
Horn, last year suffered an accident that led him to wear (in the middle of his
election campaign) Star Wars-style headgear to stabilize his neck.  Plastic
copies of the device became a popular fad among young people.  The defense
minister, Gyorgy Keleti, is an unabashed UFO buff.  The mayor, the exceedingly
charming Gabor Demszky, was a former dissident and publisher of banned books. 
Now, he wears a suit and is trying to solve the parking problem.  
<BR></P>
<P>Budapest has re-awakened, and while it is still stirring after a long sleep
under communist rule, the city has kept the Old World charm that make it such an
attractive place to visit.  There are two moods of Budapest, representing the
old and the new: the pleasantly lazy lifestyle of cafes, thermal baths, simple
living and low-cost opera, and the frenetic, ambitious lifestyles of the
would-be rich and famous, the young Hungarians and Western business people who
came here to capitalize on a fast-changing economy.  Budapest offers both, and
the visitor or resident doesn't have to choose between them. 
<BR></P>
<P>The magnetism has led more than 10,000 Americans to make Budapest home,
sometimes years longer than they planned.  Budapest has a character not unlike
that of New York City:  people will complain about it, but they find it
difficult to leave.  Many Hungarians, meanwhile, have come back.  During the
1956 revolution, which was quashed by the Soviets, many Hungarians fled to
Vienna, then to the United States or Canada.  Now they are back, reclaiming
their past and building a new future.  They are people like Gaston Vadasz, who
was a young boy when he and his mother carried their suitcases &#151;- heavy, he
remembers, to his small arms &#151;- in terror across the Hungarian-Austrian
border in December of 1956, paying a farmer to guide them.  The border was
marked by several feet of carefully raked dirt, fashioned to show footprints.
Vadasz and his mother were two of the lucky ones who made it.  Now, with his
wife Linda, he is back in Budapest  as marketing director for Juventus radio. 
<BR></P>
<P>It is that history that separates Hungary from the other former East Bloc
states.  Hungary and its people cannot be lumped in with those of its neighbors.
 The origin of the people is different; the culture is different, and -- most
frustrating for the visitor -- the language is different, so different that some
linguists consider it to be among the world's most difficult languages to
master. It is considered a &quot;hardship&quot; language by the State
Department, which gives foreign service staff a differential in salary for
proficiency in Hungarian.  Not a Slavic language, Hungarian is Finno-Ugric,
making Finnish its closest cousin.  This hardly helps.  &quot;I don't understand
a word they say,&quot; said a Finnish traveler, negotiating the bus system.  &quot;It's
not a language, it's a code,&quot; a Hungarian friend explains, advising
expatriates not to bother learning Hungarian. &quot;It's too hard.&quot; 
<BR></P>
<P>Fortunately for the many visitors who flock to Budapest in the warmer
weather, many people here speak another language.  The older folk tend to speak
German, while the younger Budapestians often know English.  Most also know
Russian -- they were once required to learn it in school -- but they don't like
to speak it.  And Hungarians are very flattered and gracious at the foreigner's
attempts to utter a few words  of the language.  
<BR></P>
<P><I><B>Buda</B></I><BR></P>
<P>Language aside, Budapest is a city seemingly made for tourists.  Getting
lost is a pleasure, since the architecture is spectacular and there are
historical sights in almost every neighborhood in the city.  Start with
Citadella, a fortress and monument atop Gellert Hill (so named because St.
Gellert was thrown from the hill to his death). From the top, reachable by bus
or foot, there is a perfect view of all Budapest -- the winding streets, grand
boulevards and beautiful spires of bustling Pest across the Danube, and the
green, almost rural hills of Buda, the more peaceful and more expensive segment
of the city.  At the top there is also the Liberation Memorial, a girl holding a
palm leaf in her upstretched hands.  At one time, the statue was accompanied by
Red Army soldiers to commemorate the Soviet Union's &quot;liberation&quot; of
Hungary. Those figures have been taken away -- with other now offensive statues
-- to the city's Statue Park in the 22nd district.  The fortress today has a
restaurant, beer garden, and youth hostel.   
<BR></P>
<P>Alongside Gellert Hill is the famous Gellert Hotel, known for its thermal
baths as much as for its accommodations.  One of Budapest's 100-plus thermal
baths, the Gellert is like something out of The Road to Wellville, with baths
fed by hot springs that have been around for more than 2,000 years.  There are
massage services, a sauna and an outdoor pool.  The Gellert also offers low-cost
dental care and treatments such as underwater traction, which must be ordered by
a doctor.  
<BR></P>
<P>Nearby in Buda is the breath-taking Castle District, atop a hill overlooking
the river.  Be warned:  the area is well traveled by tourists and thus very
expensive.  Instead, savor the views from Fisherman's Bastion, the turreted
remains of Castle Hill's oldest church.  Stop also into  nearby Matthias Church
before wandering the old, narrow streets of the Castle District.  Not to be
missed are the city's national museums, clustered on the southern end of the
district.  These include the Hungarian National Gallery, the Budapest Historic
Museum and the Museum of Recent History (formerly the Museum of the Hungarian
Working Class Movement). In the center of the Castle District is the Budavari
Labiruntus (labyrinth of Buda Castle)&#151;touristy but fun. 
<BR></P>
<P><I><B>Pest</B></I><BR></P>
<P>Pest, the busier side of the river, is loaded with visitor attractions. 
Perhaps the most imposing is the Parliament Building, a massive baroque
structure whose beautiful image is reflected into the nearby Danube at night.
Visitors may walk around the late 19th-century, 691-room building, but tours of
the inside&#151;with its spectacular frescos and paintings&#151;must be arranged
through a tourist agency. 
<BR></P>
<P>Across the street from the Parliament is the Museum of Ethnography, which
has a permanent exhibition called &quot;The Folk Culture of the Hungarian
People,&quot; as well as impressive temporary exhibitions.  But the
neo-classical building is worth a visit for its extraordinarily ornate interior
alone.  A quick ride on the subway brings the visitor to Deak Tere, a local
transportation hub for Pest. Nearby is St. Stephen's Basilica, the city's
biggest church. The mosaics are worth seeing, but don't miss St. Stephen's
mummified hand.  For a few coins, the hand is lit up and supposedly moves. 
<BR></P>
<P>A few blocks away are Vaci utca and Vorosmarty Tere, pedestrian areas that
are the gathering place for artists, tourists, street musicians, shoppers and
trinket-hawkers. There are also a few cafes, including the famous Gerbeaud,
which has rich pastries and outdoor seating.  As in the Castle District,  prices
in Vaci utca's fashionable stores are high, geared to the foreign tourist. 
Because of Hungary's high sales tax and import fees, prices on Western goods
here are more expensive than in the States. Wait to purchase such goods at the
airport duty-free shop.  
<BR></P>
<P>At the southern end of Vaci utca is the Market Hall, recently  renovated and
a favorite shopping place for everything from fresh vegetables to home-made
tablecloths.  A quick walk west, by the Marriott Hotel, brings one to the Danube
bank, where there are plenty of outdoor cafes and city benches from which to
watch the riverboats glide by.  The boats provide a pretty trip up the river to
nearby Margaret Island, where locals swim at the pool, roller-skate, jog or just
absorb the sun.  No cars are allowed on Margaret Island, which also can be
reached from either side of  Margit Bridge.  Jutting off from Deak Tere is
Andrassy ut, Budapest's best-known grand boulevard. It is also the route of the
city's yellow line subway&#151;the oldest in continental Europe&#151;but the
line is closed for lengthy repair.  Take a bus instead.<BR></P>
<P>Along Andrassy are displayed some of the city's most impressive
architecture, including the neo Renaissance style Opera House.  Tours are
available for about $4.00 -- but why bother, when a ticket to the show can be
had for as little as $1.50?  At the end of Andrassy is Hosok Tere (Hero's
Square), a square and series of statues honoring Hungary's kings and leaders,
including heroes of the 1956 revolution.  The square is also the main entrance
to City Park, a half-square mile park filled with a zoo, a theater, restaurants,
the Szechenyi thermal baths, and the Vajdahunyad Castle, which now houses a
museum.   
<BR></P>
<P>But perhaps the best way to enjoy Budapest is to do nothing -  or almost
nothing.  Sit at an outdoor table at one of the city's many cafes, or soak in
one of the thermal baths while you wait for your foot massage.  Camp out at a
bench along the river, or find a perch atop Castle Hill.  The city bustles with
a new attitude, but still finds time to relax.  &#164;</P>

</I><BR></LI>
<LI>The <I>Budapest Hilton</I> has all the  amenities of the Hilton chain, but
without the chain feel. It's situated in the heart of the heart of the Castle
District, next to a 13th-century monastery. Views&#151;some of the river&#151;are
remarkable. <BR><I>Budapest I, Hess Andras ter 1-3. Tel.: (36-1) 175-1000.

</I><BR></LI>
<LI><I>Grand Hotel Corvinus Kempinski.</I> This is a hotel for diplomats (it's
where many heads of state stayed during the meeting of the Conference on
Security and Cooperation in Europe last December) as well as high-powered
business people. With an extremely modern decor, the Kempinski is situated near
popular Vaci utca, the city's main shopping drag. <BR><I>Budapest V, Erzsebet

</I><BR></LI>
<LI>The <I>Astoria</I>, with its Victorian-style rooms, is handily located in
downtown Pest.  A big attraction is the hotel's cafe, also called Astoria, which
is one of the city's most relaxing and charming coffeehouses.  <BR><I>Budapest
V, Kossuth Lajos utca 19-21. Tel.: (36-1) 117-3411. Fax: 118-6798.  $$ 
</I><BR></LI></UL>
<P><B>Restaurants</B><BR></P>
<UL>
<LI><I>Gundel</I>, recently named the best restaurant in Eastern Europe,
provides the diner with a kind of out-of-body culinary experience.  The
traditional Hungarian food is tremendous; the staff is superb and the
surroundings are ornate.  <BR><I>Budapest XIV, Allatkerti ut 2. Tel.: (36-1)
321-3550/268-0446.  Reservations.  $$$$</I><BR></LI>
<LI><I>Bagolyvar</I> could be called the poor man's Gundel, sharing the same
kitchen -  but not the same prices  - as its neighbor. The menu and wine list
are more limited that that of Gundel, but the food is similarly wonderful. 
<BR><I>Budapest XIV, Allatkerti ut 2. Tel.: (36-1) 351-6395/118-7347.  $$</I><BR></LI>
<LI><I>Amadeus</I> provides more than a meal; it's a cultural experience.  The
artwork on the wall is the creation of the restaurant's owner.  Many locals
consider Amadeus to be the best in Budapest, with its marinated seafood and open
grill. <BR><I>Budapest V, Apaczai Csere Janos utca 13. Tel.: (36-1) 118-4677. 
$$$</I><BR></LI>
<LI><I>Nancsi Neni</I>. Situated in the Buda Hills (but accessible by public
transportation), Nancsi Neni is a romantic getaway with well-made, homemade
dishes to boot.  With indoor and outdoor seating, the restaurant has the feel of
a family-run establishment in the French countryside.  The author's favorite
restaurant in the city.  <BR><I>Budapest II, Ordogarok u. 80.  Tel.: (36-1)
176-5809.  $$ to $</I><BR></LI>
<LI><I>Orient Express</I>.  Don't be fooled by the name -- this charming place
boasts good, hearty Hungarian food, and gets its moniker from the decor.  The
restaurant, located near a train station, is actually a refurbished old train
car, with compartments converted into booths.  The staff are perhaps the most
friendly and warm in the city and the food is wonderful.  <BR><I>Budapest I,
Krisztina Krt, across from Deli station. Tel: (36) 06-20-351-137.  $</I><BR></LI></UL>
<P><B>Sights</B><BR></P>
<UL>
<LI><I>Citadella</I>.  Located at the top of Gellert Hill (a quick bus ride or
character-building, calf-bulking walk to  the top)  provides the best view of
Budapest 's green hills and dense downtown.  The Liberation Memorial used to be
joined by Red Army soldiers, but these statues were taken down after the
communists left town.  There's also a bar, a good but over-priced restaurant,
and an inexpensive hotel at the top.<BR></LI>
<LI><I>Heroes Square</I>.  A spectacular entrance to the city's vast and
activity-packed City Park, Heroes Square is Budapest's version of the Parisian
Trocadero, with its marble floor and statues of Hungarian freedom-fighters. 
Stalin  - or his likeness -  was torn down by a mob of angry Hungarians during
the aborted revolution attempt in 1956.  Now skateboarders zoom around the
square while guards watch the National War Memorial.<BR></LI>
<LI><I>Spas</I>.  Do not leave Budapest without visiting at least one of the
city's famous, therapeutic baths. A bath and a massage can be had for less than
$5.  There is no room for modesty: most of the baths (with separate facilities
for men and women) are occupied by unself-conscious, body-confident people,
regardless of their ages or shapes.  Favorites include the spas at the Gellert
and the Thermal hotels, as well as the 15th-century Kiraly Baths (Budapest II,
Fo utca 84), built by the Turks and featuring  steamy, dim pools.  For those who
are uncomfortable getting naked with strangers, there's always the $1 foot
massage.<BR></LI>
<LI><I>Opera House</I>.  This is entertainment even for those who don't like
opera.  The building, located on Budapest's grand Andrassy ut, is a spectacular,
neo-Renaissance style structure that is enough to hold one's attention well into
the third act. Tickets -  for both the ballet and the opera -  are cheap, and
the sets are consistently remarkable.  Between acts, sip a $2 glass of champagne
in the carved-wood tearoom, or wander out to see the beautiful view from the
Opera House's balcony.<BR></LI>
<LI><I>The Castle District</I>.  Walk, look, wander through the area's many
museums, ranging from the national art gallery to the smaller music museum. 
Just don't buy anything from the hordes of &quot;traditionally&quot; dressed
vendors; it's at least twice as expensive as anywhere else in the city.  Don't
miss the view from Fisherman's Bastion of the Parliament, the Danube, and Margit
Island.<BR></LI>
<LI><I>Need to shop?</I>  Take the 154 bus from Boraros ter, on the Pest side,
to the famous Ecseri flea market, said to be the biggest in Europe.  This is the
perfect place to pick up old Russian medals and uniforms, as well as home-made
lace tablecloths and antique furniture.<BR></LI></UL>

This, combined with the superior brightness of 500 ANSI lumens, gives the DP5600 razor-sharp, brilliant images, even in well-lit rooms. Weighing just 16.5 pounds, this road-worthy projector is one convenient multimedia peripheral.
<p>
Exceptionally easy to set up and use, the DP5600 has a motorized 1.6:1 zoom 
lens that allows you to position the projector almost anywhere in the room. 
Four-position image control provides even greater flexibility by allowing for 
front-, rear-, or ceiling-mounted projection. And, if your computer is 
connected serially to the projector, you can control both from anywhere in 
the room with the full-featured remote control. Like all <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> <A HREF="../Solutions/solutions.html">multimedia projectors</A>, the DP5600 is compatible with virtually all PCs and Macintosh computers, and worldwide video capability is also a standard feature.

Weighing just 11 pounds, and small enough to fit into a small attache case, the <A HREF="../Solutions/proxima.cgi?template=item.html&item=LB10&sction=Description">Lightbook projector</A> is the most reliable and trustworthy traveling companion you'll ever have. It's a small projector that packs a big punch in the conference room!

And even in the smallest rooms, <A HREF="lightbook.html">the Lightbook projector makes your big ideas look bigger and brighter</A>. Its sharp, high-contrast image looks great--even with the lights on. When your ideas are big, bright, and colorful, people pay attention.

<p>
<B>Pay attention to your audience, not your projector.</B>
<p>
The Lightbook projector is easy to set up and use, giving you the freedom to think about your message, not your projector. Place it on the end of a conference table, connect it to your computer, and you're ready to present! And the Lightbook projector's intuitive user interface makes presenting as simple as clicking your mouse.
<p>
To display the optimum image size, most projectors force you to move them back and forth on the conference table--taking your valuable time and distracting your audience. In today's fast-paced business world, you can't afford to spend your precious time setting up your equipment. The Lightbook projector works best right where you expect it--out of the way, at the front of the conference table. And it's so easy to connect, that you'll have extra time to work with your audience. 
<p>
<B>Form follows function.</B>
<p>
Life on the road can be rough. That's why the LightBook projector was designed to handle the rigors of travel. When you close the Lightbook projector, the sensitive optics are securely stowed inside a sleek protective case. Add to that a sturdy metal frame, and you've got one tough traveling companion.
<p>
<IMG SRC="gifs/lightbook2.gif" align = left width = 243 height = 180 alt = "Photo of Lightbook When Opened" hspace = 9>Once you've reached your destination, opening the projector is easy. Simply press the lock-release buttons, lift the cover, and open the protective lens cover. When you're finished with your presentation, it's just as easy to safely and securely close your Lightbook projector. Simply reverse the opening procedures and you're ready to hit the road.
<p>
As an added bonus, your Lightbook projector comes with a sleek executive-styled carrying case that is small, compact, and portable. With your new projector safe and secure, you can focus on your next destination.

<H3>What is Multimedia Projection:</H3>
<p>
Multimedia projection is the process of displaying computer based information on a large screen to facilitate group communication.  By combining the benefits of large screen projection with the power of the computer, multimedia projection offers the same increase in productivity to workgroups that personal computers give to individuals.<br>
<IMG SRC="gifs/meeting_picture.gif" align = right hspace = 8>
<p>
<B>Using Multimedia Projection for Meetings</B>
<br>
Multimedia Projection makes your meetings more productive by allowing everyone to simultaneously view and work with computer based information. Group projects such as scheduling and budgeting can be displayed, reviewed, and finalized in a single meeting. Full group participation builds consensus and ensures that the final result has everyone's support.<br clear = all>

<p>
<B>Using Multimedia Projection for Powerful Presentations</B><BR>
Multimedia projection is an extremely effective communication tool. Plug a Proxima multimedia projection system into your computer to present everything from simple charts and graphics to complex animation and video.
<p>
The result is a dynamic multimedia experience that standard overhead, slide, or flip chart presentations can't match.
<p>
By creating the your presentation directly on the computer - using the software you are already familiar with-you save the time and expense of creating overheads, slides, and other presentation materials.<br clear = all>
<p>
<H3>Multimedia Projection Benefits:</H3>
<p>
<B>More Efficient</B>
<br>
Multimedia projection is faster and less expensive than producing slides or transparencies.
<p>
<B>More Effective</B><BR>
Multimedia projection has superior image quality and the possibility of integration of sound and motion can let you make more compelling presentations.
<p>
<B>More Convenient</B><BR>

<h2>Top-10 Questions</h2>
<ol>
<li><b>How can I get the Windows 95 driver for Cyclops?</b>

<IMG SRC="gifs/new.gif">

<p>The Cyclops driver for Windows 95 is now available!  To download, 
<A HREF="cyclopsgrid.html">click here for more information</A>. 
<p>

</li>
<A NAME="SVGA"></A>
<li><b>My notebook computer has an internal 800x600 LCD screen and the projected image is either 

missing information from the top/bottom, compressed from left/right or doesn't appear at all. What is 

wrong?</b> <p>Here is some information to help get you going with your setup. For more detailed assistance, take a look at 

<a href="fieldnotes40.html">Field Note #40</a> which explains why this may be occurring. </p>

<p>To configure the external video signal to 640x480 mode: </p>

<ol>

<li>Set the PC display resolution to 640x480. This is done through Windows Setup (Win 3.1) or Control 

Panel, Display Icon (Windows 95).</li>

<li>Connect the Proxima product to the computer using the appropriate cable.</li>

<li>Configure the PC to display video only on the external video port. This is usually done through a 

combination of keystrokes (such as FN+F3) or a hardware setup program (consult your computer 

documentation for details). Checkout the <a href="faq_notebook.html">Notebook/Laptop Computer Video Port Activation Chart</a>.</li>

<li>Re-start Windows to set the external video to 640x480 mode. The image will appear on the LCD panel. 

Sync and frequency adjustments may be needed. </li>

</ol>

</li>

<li><b>My panel/projector displays an image in DOS but when I go into Windows, the panel/projector just 

flickers or doesn't appear at all. What do I do?</b> <p>If you are able to at least see your computer count memory on the Proxima device, we know the Proxima device 

is functioning correctly. The first thing you'll want to check is the resolution of your video driver for Windows. 

You need to make sure the driver is set for a resolution of 640x480.</p>

<p>To set the resolution in Windows 3.x, go into Windows Setup in the Main window. Select Options, Change 

System Settings, select VGA or a 640 x 480 resolution, then restart Windows. To set the resolution in Windows 

95, select Start, Settings, Control Panel, Display Icon, Settings Tab. Select a 640x 480 resolution. </p>

<p>If you are using a laptop with an internal 800x600 screen, you may have to set the resolution to 640x480 and 

run it in external only mode to get an image on the panel or projector. Many laptops with an internal 800x600 

screen drive the internal screen at 800x600 resolution even though you have it set to 640x480. Checkout the 

<a href="faq_notebook.html">Notebook/Laptop Computer Video Port Activation Chart</a>. </p>

<p>Graphics cards in PCs can be set at different vertical refresh rates (or vertical sync rates) within the same 

resolution. For example, at 640 x 480, the vertical refresh rate can be set at 60 or 72 Hz. (72 Hz is a faster 

refresh rate.) The following is a table of compatibilities with resolutions, vertical refresh rates and Proxima panels: </p>

<table border=1>

<li><b>When I use my Ovation 920 with a Silicon Graphics Workstation, the image cannot be stabilized. 
What's wrong?</b>
<p>When connecting a Proxima Ovation+920 to Silicon Graphics Workstations,
including all Indy and Indigo<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>2</FONT></SUP>
models, use the Proxima SGI Cable Kit, A36.  The SGI Cable Kit
contains two C943-6 SGI 13C3 to 13C3 connector cables.</p>

<p>For more information about this issue, take a look at <a href="fldnt37a.html">Field Note #37a</a>. </p>

</li>

<li><b>On my Desktop Projector 5xxx, how many input sources can be connected at once?</b> 
<p>The DP5100 can support up to 2 video (with audio) and 2 computer sources at any given time. </p>
</li>

<li><b>Does the Desktop Projector 5100 have a switchable power supply?</b>
 <p>The power supply of the DP5100 will only support 100-120V. The international
 version of the DP5100 is the DP5100-I. The DP5100-I is 220V only and it is not a
 switchable power supply. If you want to take a US model overseas, use a power
 converter rated at least 500 WATTS. </p>
</li>

<li><b>What cables do I need to connect my Mac PowerBook to the DP2xxx? </b>
<p>The DP 2xxx already comes with a Macintosh Video Y-Cable (C464-6).
 In addition to the cable, an external 3rd party video adapter is required 
(Apple Part Number: M3927LL/A). </p>
</li>

<li><b>With the Mac PowerBook, how can I display both internal and external at the same time?</b>
 <p>The method of controlling whether the internal screen works in addition to the panel is
 called video mirroring.</p>
<p>To control video mirroring, in <i>Control Panel, PowerBook Display,</i> set 
Video Mirroring to ON for both internal and external <i>-OR-</i> OFF for image on external 
panel only or internal only, depending on monitor selection in <i>Monitors</i>. </p>

</li>

<li><b>What should I do when the "Cyclops Not Detected" message appears as Windows loads?</b> <ol>

<li>Check the Cyclops camera unit itself. Does Cyclops beep when the projector/panel 
is turned on? Does it respond to calibration initiation? </li>

<li>Check the connections/power. Is the Cyclops cable plugged into computer (serial port)
 and projector/panel (RS 232/Cyclops port)? Is it securely connected? </li>

<li>Check the serial cable. Are any of the pins on the cable pushed in or bent? </li>

<li>Check the serial port on the computer. Cyclops must be on COM1 or COM2. Is there an 
internal modem in the PC? If so, the modem needs to be disabled or set to a com port/IRQ 
that does not interfere. Is there a PCMCIA card in the PC? If so, it needs to be disabled. 
To check serial communication, run CYDOS program (on Cyclops installation diskettes, in 
PROXIMA directory.)</li>

</ol>
<p>Note: With Cyclops models 2020, 2030, and 2060, if you get "Cyclops not detected" message
 and everything appears fine (serial connections, etc.), disconnect the serial cable and
 cycle power on panel/projector, then reconnect the cable and continue. </p>
</li>

<li><b>What is the <i>typical</i> lamp life for the different Proxima Projectors and what 
affects it?</b> 
<p>Lamp life is a function of temperature, so in warm rooms lamps will last for a shorter 
period of time than in cooler rooms. At higher altitudes (where the air is thinner and is 
therefore less efficient in cooling the lamps) lamp life will be reduced. For more information 
on operating a projector at high altitudes, check out 
<a href="fieldnotes39.html">Field Note #39</a>. </p>

<p>Lamp brand also has an effect on lamp life. We specify using only GE lamps.  Other 3rd party
lamps may last only a fraction of GE lamp life. Transporting the projector with lamps installed can physically affect the lamp life 
be disturbing the lamp element, base integrity or the lamp's seating in the lamp socket. Restricting airflow 
(blocked vents, placement in a confined area, etc.) to the projector can cause lamps to become too hot and 
blow early. </p>

<table border=1>
<tr><td><b>Projector</b></td><td><b>Lamp Type</b></td><td><b>Typical Lamp Life</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>LB10 </td><td>EVD</td><td> 50 hours</td></tr>
<tr><td> 2300/2700/2800 </td><td>Quartz Halogen </td><td> 40 hours</td></tr>
<tr><td> 2400/2710/2810 </td><td>Quartz Halogen </td><td> 30 hours</td></tr>
<tr><td> 2900/2910</td><td>Metal Halide</td><td> *400 hours</td></tr>
<tr><td> 4100/4200</td><td>Metal Halide</td><td>400 hours</td></tr>
<tr><td> 5100/8300/8400</td><td>Metal Halide</td><td> *750-1000 hours</td></tr>
<tr><td> 5500</td><td>Metal Halide</td><td> *2000 hours</td></tr>
<tr><td> 9100</td><td>Metal Halide</td><td> *700 hours</td></tr>

</table>
<p>*=The typical life is how long the lamp will project up to 50% of its initial brightness. </p>

<B>I am unable to obtain an image when the DP5600 is connected to a computer or the computer image fades. What do I do?</B><p>

Sometimes the DP5600 is unable to determine the type of signal coming from the computer. With the remote control:<p>
<ol>
<li>Press MENU.
<li>Choose Setting, then PC ADJUSTMENT.
<li>Choose any mode to use under the "WHERE TO RESERVE" menu.
<li>Choose MEMORY, then QUIT.<p>
</ol><br>
<I>NOTE: The image may go back to the previous settings. If so, the new mode must be selected. Press MENU, then SYSTEM, then choose SEARCH.</I><br>

<TITLE> Presentation Science - The Presentation Itself </TITLE>
</HEAD>

<BODY bgcolor="FFFFFF" vlink="AF0040" alink="04BC04">

<A HREF="univ_science.map"><IMG SRC="gifs/science_header.gif" width = 600 height = 114  ISMAP border = none alt = "Presentation Science"></A>
<H2>The Presentation Itself</H2>
<table width = 598>
	<tr>
		<td><font size = +1>The first issue to consider is the presentation itself. There are volumes written on presentation design, so we'll just try to hit the high points. How a presentation is created, and what is in it, is entirely subjective, with the exception of font sizes and styles.
<p>
<menu>
<B>What is the intent of your presentation?</B>
<p>
Is your presentation to sell something (ideas or items), teach something, provide information only, or one or more of myriad other purposes? How you send a message should absolutely fit what you're trying to send. For true interaction, the ability to stop, start, and move freely from one topic to another in your presentation is an absolute necessity. If your intent is information dissemination only, a prerecorded, free-running message will do nicely.</font>
<p>
			<table width = 549>
				<tr>
					<td valign = top><font size = +1>R</font>ULE&#160<font size = +1>O</font>F&#160<font size = +1>T</font>HUMB: </td>
					<td><B>PRESENTATION DEVELOPMENT:</B>  DEFINE THE SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES OF THE PRESENTATION IN WRITING BEFORE YOU START. CHECK TO SEE THEY ARE FULFILLED WHEN YOU FINISH.</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
<p>
<font size = +1>
<B>What type of audience will you be presenting to?</B> 
<p>
The type of audience you're facing should define the message delivery style and your presentation vehicle(s). A presentation for an engineering society might look and flow much differently than a presentation at a theme park. The amount of detailed numerical data, characters, and/or graphic images in your presentation is really driven by the message you're trying to send to the specific audience in front of you.
<p>
<B>What type of medium will you use?</B> 
<p>
Having the most awesome multimedia presentation your audience has ever seen would be great, but it's usually not feasible, given your schedule and budget. You do want to capture their minds and imaginations, so make the most of what you have. Use colors and graphics as much and as often as possible, but within reason. Each of your images should make sense and build upon the prior image.
<p>
<B>What fonts/typefaces are best?</B>
<p>
The most important thing about choosing a font (or fonts) is legibility. Ideally, the words in your presentation will be read and understood in such a way as to not call attention to the words themselves. If several people comment on the type of font you're using, they are noticing the format, not the idea or information.

<table width = 598>
	<tr>
		<td><font size = +1>The presentation environment is the variable you usually have the least control over, and has the widest possible variations. Some of the issues to consider are:
<p>
<menu>
<p>
<B>Room Size/Configuration</B> 
<p>
There are an infinite number of styles, sizes and configurations you may encounter as you go; it's not as significant a challenge if all of your presentations are done in-house. On the road, the best you can expect is to get the room dimensions and arrangement via telephone or fax prior to arrival; usually, you will get into the room (already set up) 1-2 hours prior to the presentation.
<p>
Room configuration is important because it drives how large an image you must display, which drives how large a screen you use, which raises the question of the viewing angle generated by the seating arrangement.
<p>
<B>Viewing Angle</B>
<p>
If the room is wider than it is long, the image does not have to be as large, but the viewing angle of the audience to the extreme right and left comes into question. Screen type can also be a major consideration; high reflectivity screens provide a very bright image but a much narrower viewing angle than a low reflectivity matte screen. (For more information on screens and viewing angles, see the Presentation Equipment section.)
<p>

					<td><B>VIEWING ANGLE:</B>  The extreme right and left seats in the front row or table must not be at an angle greater than 50&#176; from the center of a screen; No more than 35&#176; is optimum for most screens.</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
<p>
<B>Viewing Distance</B>
<p>
The viewing distance really defines the minimum and maximum size the image can be. The farther it is to the image, the larger the image size must be for people in the back to see all the details (and the screen used must be larger). The general rule of thumb for optimum viewing is 2-8 times the vertical height of the image.

<H2>The Presentation Equipment</H2>
<table width = 598>
	<tr>
		<td><font size = +1>The right equipment and some common sense precautions will help set your room up for the best possible presentation. 
<p>
<menu>
<p>
<B>Screens</B> 
<p>
Depending on how much of your presentation is centered around the presentation system itself, the screen should be either mounted at a 45&#176; angle in a front corner or mounted flat against a wall that has a dark, non-reflective surface. There should be no obstructions (including you) between the projection screen and the projector. 
<p>
Use the following table as a guide to the common types of projection screens you are likely to encounter. The screen types are listed in order of increasing reflectivity.
<p>
<center>
<IMG SRC="gifs/science2.gif" width = 540 height = 465>
<p>
</center>
<I>Rear Projection Screens</I>
<p>
Selecting the proper projection screen type is critical when using the Proxima Cyclops interactive pointer system in rear-projection applications. Use only membrane-type rear-projection screens (i.e. DA-Lite&#174; or DA-Tex<font size = "-1"><sup>TM</sup></font>). Don't use screens that have a built-in Fresnel lens or those that feature a laminated stack of lenses. 
<p>
<B>Overhead projectors and projection panels</B>
<p>
This is the most common type of equipment used for computer image projection today. While very easy to transport, set up, and use, the biggest drawback to using a projection panel is the limited brightness developed on the screen. Even with one of the brightest, most expensive overhead projectors available, don't expect more than 120 ANSI lumens on the screen. 80-100 ANSI lumens is more the norm.
<p>
Low image brightness means you have to turn down room lights to achieve the "Ambient Light x 2" rule of thumb. In almost every case of use with a projection panel and overhead projector you will have to extinguish all fluorescent lights in the room (and most lighting in general), regardless of the audience size or how far they set from the screen. 
<p>
Low room lighting makes eye-contact and note-taking a challenge. Open your presentation with the lights on and establish repoire and eye-contact with your audience. If your presentation requires writing note-taking, provide hard copies of your slides/images before turning down the lights. If no notes are required, consider handing out copies of your presentation images afterwards as a reinforcement tool.

<font size = "+1"><font color = "BF0000"><B>EZTools</B></font> is a floating toolbar that, in combination with the EZPresenter VGA PC Card, allows you to use your notebook computer's display independently of the audience's display. This means PowerPoint can be in slide show mode on the audience display and slide sorter mode on the notebook's display simultaneously! You can preview your presentation, read prepared notes from the computer display, and even step into another application momentarily, all without your audience seeing any changes, unless you want them to. With a single click, you can link the two screens for simultaneous display. Click again to unlink them and return to your private screen.</font>

<font size = "+1"><font color = "BF0000"><B>Creator</B></font> is a software multimedia presentation package for MS Windows with more features than systems at ten times the cost. Creator combines functionality and flexibility in a point and click interface requiring no programming knowledge.
<IMG SRC="gifs/microvitec1.gif" width = 155 height = 162 alt = "Photo of MicroVitec Multimedia Product" align = right hspace = 6>
<p>
The Creator interface allows swift planning and implementation of interactive multimedia presentations using images, text, branching, animation, video and audio--plus a huge range of template backdrops to save you time in preparation. Also included in every Creator package is a free CD-ROM packed with sample graphics, MIDI, WAV and AVI files to give your multimedia presentation that extra buzz. With over 50 different types of fades, dissolves, and effects (100 with <font color = "BF0000"><B>Creator Professional</B></font>), Creator will enable you to hold your audience's attention. Add the multiple audio tracks, and you now have a multiple language presentation.
<p>
Creator provides access to 95% of the screen area by using floating tools that are only on the screen when you need them. Move from text to video, and the text tool is automatically replaced by the video tool. When your presentation is finished, you can publish it to disk using the royalty free run time Creator publisher that will allow your audience to review your presentation over and over again.
<p>
Creator is the answer to true Multimedia presentations, but don't take our word for it--contact us today for your free Creator demo disk.</font>

<font size = "+1">The <font color = "BF0000"><B>SMART Board</B></font> is an interactive electronic whiteboard  that dramatically improves the effectiveness of your meetings and training sessions by allowing you to naturally bring computer power into your meeting room. All this is provided in a solution that works, looks, and feels like a regular whiteboard.
<IMG SRC="gifs/smart1.gif" HEIGHT=140 WIDTH=173 alt = "Photo of SMART Technologies Inc. Product" align = right hspace = 6>
<p>
Once you display your computer information onto the 4' by 3' SMART Board using any LCD panel or LCD projector, simply touch on the Board to control software and bring up documents, spreadsheets, or designs. With the SMART Board it is natural and easy to use your software during a meeting. Plus, you can still use the SMART Board as a whiteboard--simply pick up a marker, and write notes with colorful electronic ink over any projected image. All this can be done on a large interactive whiteboard that everyone in the room can see.
<p>
You can also use the SMART Board without a projector to capture whiteboard notes immediately on your computer. The SMART Board recognizes four colors of pens and an eraser, so you can write as you would on an ordinary whiteboard. After meetings, you can print, e-mail, or copy and paste your notes into other applications.</font>

<IMG SRC="gifs/rehfeld.gif" width = 148 height = 216 align = left hspace = 9 alt = "Photo of John Rehfeld">Interactive multimedia technologies create an exciting atmosphere in the classroom, and with that excitement comes students' drive to excel.   But providing access to such exciting tools as on-line resources, including the Internet, CD-ROM and laserdisc-based research applications, and distance learning satellite feeds from the other side of the globe...all of this is still a dream for most schools which can't yet provide students access to a computer for more than 15-30 minutes per week, if at all.
<p>
Limited budgets are, of course, the biggest obstacle to full technology integration in the classroom, an many states, school boards and front-line educators have applied creative funding strategies to support their technology plans.  But the answer isn't funding alone, nor is it the sole responsibility of the education community.
<p>
Software, hardware and other technology companies which serve education have an obligation to provide products and services that are tailored to educator's needs-affordable, easy to use, and most of all, work in concert with other technologies for maximum effectiveness.  But in a market of ever-emerging technologies, rapid obsolescence, and incompatible platforms, we haven't made it very easy.
<p>
By working together and creating alliances, businesses can provide technological ease and agility to educators. the joint efforts of Apple Computer, Motorola, and IBM are a landmark example of such cooperation.
<p>
In another that specifically addresses education needs, Proxima Corp., a leading developer and manufacturer of computer-based desktop projection systems, has joined Compaq Computer Corp. in its 20-city North America Road Show. The turnkey solution presented to educators includes - Connecting students via LAN or WAN - Utilizing existing technologies and investments such as video tapes, laserdiscs, and CATV - Incorporating the Internet, video
conferencing, and other emerging technologies - Using desktop projection equipment to extend technology's value through group learning, teacher or student presentations, and by simply giving more students access to all technologies.  Several leading companies are part of this cooperative marketing program, that demonstrates how numerous technologies work together.
<p>
Another example I like is one that, while applied in a business setting, mirrors the need for ongoing staff development among educators.  AT&T teamed up with Apollo Group Inc., a Phoenix-based software company, and the
University of Phoenix to provide more than 200,000 of its employees with undergraduate and graduate courses.  The telecommunications giant has also edged into the education market by partnering with companies in different market categories as demonstrated by its partnership with Hasbro, to create the Imagination Network, an edutainment on-line service.
<p>
While it is ideal, numerous schools still do not have fully equipped, state-of-the-art technology programs to build the skills that are now emerging as a requirement for the future.  With only one computer, a modem, a phone line and a multimedia projector, instructors can introduce technology based learning to the entire classroom. Together, as a class, they can explore the plethora of educational services and products available, and even interact with other schools.  Students experience the excitement and educational benefits they need from working on-line with people and places previously inaccessible.
<p>
Because projection plays a central role in multimedia mix, Proxima is also pursuing other key alliances that will simplify the technological process and extend the value of schools' computer investment.  Adobe, Jostens Learning Corp., and Apple Computer are among those with whom we are working to provide schools with more complete, affordable solutions.  Helping to bring such programs to life for a child or an adult is the goal of Proxima and its projection systems.  Our goal in forming alliances with other companies is to make it possible for only one computer, when necessary, to be enough for an entire class to begin to achieve technology competencies.
<p>
Technology is leveraged best when considered as a powerful and flexible tool, and companies that are instrumental in bringing it to market must also be flexible.  Working cooperatively together, we as responsible technology providers can make technology what it should be -- powerful, convenient, user-friendly and above all, successful for students.  Proxima Corp. encourage and challenges technology providers to look for ways to work together, to provide more complete solutions that will let instructors get on with the business of facilitating
education.</font>

<B>Date:</B> December 15, 1995

<P>

<B>Subject:</B>   Compatibility with Laptop Computers that use 800x600

TFT Display

<P>

<br>

<H3>PROBLEM</H3>

When you try to display an image from a notebook computer that

has an 800x600 internal LCD screen, the projected image is either

missing information from the top/bottom, compressed from left/right,

or does not appear at all.

<P>

<br>

<H3>DISCUSSION</H3>

Notebook computer manufacturers such as NEC, Toshiba, Compaq,

and AST are producing computers that use an 800x600 TFT internal

display.  When the video display mode is set to simultaneous internal/external

display, the video output is always 800x600 resolution, regardless

of the display setting made in Windows (or Windows 95, OS/2, etc.).

This signal will not work with Proxima display products that require

640x480 signals.

<P>

The computer will have to be configured to provide a true 640x480

external video signal, which means that the computer will not

be able to display an image on its internal screen and the Proxima

LCD panel at the same time.

<P>

<br>

<H3>SOLUTION</H3>

To configure the external video signal to 640x480 mode:

<OL>

	<LI> Set the PC display resolution to 640x480.  This is done through

Windows Setup    (Win 3.1) or Control Panel, Display Icon (Windows

95).<p>

	<LI> Connect the Proxima product to the computer using the appropriate

cable.<p>

	<LI> Configure the PC to display video only on the external video

port.  This is usually done through a combination of keystrokes

(such as FN+F3) or a hardware setup program (consult you computer

documentation for details).<p>

	<LI> Re-start Windows to set the external video to 640x480 mode.

 The image will appear on the LCD panel.  Sync and frequency adjustments

may be needed.<p>

</OL>

<h2>Notebook/Laptop Computer Video Port Activation Chart</h2>
<FONT SIZE=-1>Updated 12/20/96</FONT>
<hr>
<p>Most notebook/laptop computers can't display their internal screens and activate the external video port at the same time. This chart provides some of the 
commands for switching back and forth between the screen and the video port for common notebook/laptop computers. Some computers have more than 
one command depending on the model. If all models use the same command, only one command is shown. </p>

</B></U>
<P>
Connecting Silicon Graphics Workstations, including models Indy
or Indigo<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>2</FONT></SUP>, to the Proxima Ovation+920
using the Proxima C801-6 video cable results in an image that
cannot be stabilized.  In addition, the range of the vertical
adjustment is not wide enough to move the image sufficiently to
allow viewing the complete image.<BR>

<P>
<U><B>DISCUSSION<BR>
</B></U>
<P>
SGI video cards support Sync on green, Composite Sync and Separate
Sync, depending on the monitor connected.  Indy and Indigo<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>2</FONT></SUP>
systems use a Sony monitor that only uses Sync on green.  The
Proxima Ovation+920 panel can support either Sync on green, or
Composite Sync, depending on the input from the computer.  The
Proxima C801-6 video cable passes all of the sync signals to the
Proxima Ovation+920.  However, connecting the SGI video to the
Proxima Ovation+920 panel using the Proxima C801-6 cable applies
all three sync signals to the Proxima Ovation+920 simultaneously,
but not on the correct pins.  This causes confusion in the Proxima
Ovation+920, resulting in an unusable image.<BR>

<P>
<U><B>SOLUTION<BR>
</B></U>
<P>
When connecting a Proxima Ovation+920 to Silicon Graphics Workstations,
including all Indy and Indigo<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>2</FONT></SUP>
models, use the Proxima SGI Cable Kit, A36.  The SGI Cable Kit
contains two C943-6 SGI 13C3 to 13C3 connector cables.  This kit:

<B>Date:</B> December 15, 1995

<P>

<B>Subject:</B>   Desktop Projector Operating Temperature in High Altitude

<P>

<br>

<H3>PROBLEM</H3>

<P>

When used at a high altitude Desktop Projector models 2xxx can

overheat at a lower room temperature than when used at Sea Level.

<P>

<br>

<H3>DISCUSSION</H3>

<P>

The maximum ambient (room) temperature for operating Desktop Projector

models 2xxx is  80o F     (27o C).  Operating the Desktop Projector

in an environment with a higher ambient temperature will cause

the LCD panel to overheat.

<P>

The maximum ambient operating temperature for the Desktop Projector

decreases 1o C for every 1000' (305m) increase in altitude.  The

maximum operating altitude for Desktop Projector models 2xxx is

5000' (1524m) above Sea Level.

<P>

<br>

<H3>SOLUTION</H3>

<P>

The following table shows the maximum ambient operating temperature

for Desktop Projector models  2xxx at various altitudes.  Using

the Desktop Projector above 5000' may not provide sufficient cooling

for the projector.<p>

<p>
<LI><B>What type of screen is best to use?</B>  
<P>
It is best to use a white matte screen. High gain screens have a narrow view angle and may cause problems with Cyclops.  
<P>
<LI><B>What is the aspect ratio of a 640x480 screen?</B>  
<P>
The aspect ratio of a 640x480 image is 4:3 (Horizontal to Vertical.)
<p>
<LI> <B>How do I convert diagonal image size to a height and width dimension?</B>  
<P>
Think of the diagonal image size as the hypotenuse of a right triangle, where the hypotenuse = 5, the height = 3, an the width = 4.  The other dimensions are then easy to figure out.  For example, if the diagonal measurement is 75 inches, take the 75 and divide by 5, which equals 15.  The height would then be 3 x 15 or 45 inches and the width would be 4 x 15 or 60 inches.  Your screen size is therefore 45" H by 60" W.  To get the number in feet, you then divide by 12.
<P>
<LI><B>What is the warranty period on Proxima projection products?</B>
<P>
The standard warranty period is 1 year from date of purchase.  Please note that extended warranties can be purchased from our dealers.
<P>
<LI><B>What information do I need to return a Proxima product for repair?</B>
<P>
To have a Proxima product repaired, it must have a RMA (Return Material Authorization) number.  Call Technical Support with the following information to get a RMA number:  product model number, serial number, date code, and description of the problem.  Technical Support may request a fax of the invoice or packing slip to verify warranty status of the product.

<LI><B>How do you get 2 million colors ?</B><p>

The LCD panel is a matrix of dots or pixels. These are arranged in 480 rows and 640 columns, 
for a total of 307,200. Each pixel is made up of 3 segments; one for red, green and blue. Each of these segments 
has its own thin film transistor, which actively controls the color and brightness of the light that passes through it.
 A total of 921,600 in all.  Using software technology developed by Proxima called Active Color Enhancement (A.C.E.)
 this number is increased up to 2 million.<p>

The number of colors can be selected on the Ovation 8xx panel by doing the following:
<ol>
<li>Press the STATUS button<br>
<li>Using the left or right arrow keys, select COLORS<br>
<li>Using the up or down keys, choose the appropriate number of colors.<br>
<li>Press the STATUS button to close the menu.<br>
</ol><p>
<I>NOTE: Changing the number of colors on the panel will NOT change the number of color selected on the computer.  Thus, you must verify that the number of colors is set correctly on the PC.  Please contact your PC vendor for more information.</I><br>
<p>

<LI><B>What is the difference between Active and Passive Matrix ?</B><p>

Both active and passive matrix have the same layout of row and column electrodes. The difference is that an active matrix storage element is located at the intersection of all row and column conductors.  This increases the clarity and  response time over passive matrix LCD panels.  
The Proxima Ovation 8xx series panels all use active matrix LCD panels.<p>

<li><B>What type of overhead projector and screen is best to use?  </B><p>

An overhead projector should be between 3000 and 5500 lumens.  It should be a transmissive projector (light source comes from the bottom), not reflective (light source comes from above).<p>

It is best to use a white matte screen. High gain screens have a narrow viewing angle and may cause  problems with Cyclops.  <p>

<li><B>Troubleshooting the Ovation 8xx LCD Panel</B><p>

<I>Ghosting:</I>  While using the NTSC video input, if the vertical positioning is too high, it causes either the odd or even 
frame of the interlaced scan to freeze.  The effect is like a ghost image on the screen while the video is playing. 
To correct the ghosting, just lower the image using the arrow keys on the LCD panel's keypad.<p>

<I>Dot Clock:</I>  Dark vertical bars running through the display is a symptom of the Dot Clock being out of frequency.  The Dot Clock can be
modified by pressing the Status button and adjusting the Frequency.<p>

<I>Sound:</I> The panel is a monaural device (not stereo).  The source should be configured to deliver audio to only one channel.  If connecting in stereo through a 
receiver/amplifier, the volume control on either the panel or remote control will not function.

<P>
<LI><B>Why does the fan come on when the power switch is off?</B>  
<P>
When the overhead projector is on and the panel is plugged in, but the power switch is off, the fan will continue running.  This keeps the panel cool.  After the overhead projector is turned off, the fan in the panel will stop.
<P>
<LI><B>Cyclops has been calibrated and the mouse pointer follows the Cyclops pointer, so why can't I click on anything?</B>  
<P>
Bring up the panel menus, check the Cyclops menu; Button should be set to LEFT.  Also check in Windows, Control Panel, Mouse, to see if "Swap Left/Right Buttons" is checked.  This option should NOT be checked in order for Cyclops to function properly in Windows.
<P>
<LI><B>What type of mouse can be used with the panel?</B>  
<P>
When using a mouse connected to the serial port on the panel, the mouse must be a Microsoft brand serial mouse.

<P>
<LI><B>With a 1280x1024 or 1152x900 input signal, the entire image does not appear on the panel.  How can I display the entire image?</B>  
<P>
The image can be seen in two ways.  The first way is to use the arrow keys to pan the image
 around the panel.  The second way is to use the "Fit to View" feature to compress a 
1280x1024 image to 1024x768.  "Fit to View" is the ability to see the entire 1280x1024
 image on a 1024x768 projection panel.  Note:  When a 1152x900 image is in Fit to View mode, 
a small border will appear around the image.
<P>
<LI><B>When a 640x480 image is zoomed to full size or a 1280x1024 image is in Fit to View mode,
sometimes there are vertical lines through the image.</B>  
<P>
To eliminate the vertical lines, increase the Brightness (in the Image menu) or adjust the 
Vertical Position (in the Advanced menu) down.
<P>
<LI><B>Why does the 800x600 image have a black border around it?</B>  
<P>
Since the panel is 1024x768 and the image is 800x600, the area not filled in is black. 
 The Fit to View feature will not change the size of the image.
<P>
<LI><B>How can I reset the factory settings for ALL input sources?</B>  
<P>
To reset all settings to the factory settings, ensure the panel is turned on, press power, press each of the four arrow keys, power light will blink twice, press power.  
<P>
<A NAME="SGI"></A>
<LI><B>Do Silicon Graphics workstations use different cables to connect to the panel?</B>  
<P>
<ul><U>On the 920:</U> <li>If using the C801-6 cable, connect the panel to the workstation with the existing monitor cable (supplied with the workstation/monitor.)  
<p><li>Connect the SGI monitor to the panel with the C801-6 cable.  
<P>
[NOTE: Proxima has developed a cable specifically designed for use with SGI machines.  The SGI Cable Accessory Kit (Part No. A36) consists of two C943-6 SGI 13C3 to 13C3 connector cables and an instruction sheet.  One cable is used to connect the workstation video to the panel, the other to connect the panel to the monitor.  The C943-6 cables support all SGI monitor sync configurations, all SGI video systems, and sense lines when used without a monitor.]
<P></ul>
<ul><U>On the 944:</U> <li> Disconnect your computer-to-monitor cable at the computer end.<p>
<li> Connect the free end of the monitor cable to the Proxima SGI to LCD adapter (C947-12).<p>
<li> Connect the free end of the SGI to LCD adapter to the projection panel's TO MONITOR connector.<p>
<li> Use the Proxima SGI 13C3 to LCD Connector Cable (C943-6) between the projection panel and the computer.
Connect the end marked "LCD" to the projection panel's FROM COMPUTER connector, and the end marked "COMPUTER" to the SGI workstation's video output connector.
	<p><B>Note:</B> SGI workstation users that do not connect an external monitor will need to set the panel's sense lines to achieve 
the desired display resolution.  Please refer to <A HREF="fldnt38a.html">Field Note #38a</A> for sense line settings.<p>
</ul>
<LI><B>Does the Ovation+944/920 panel support interlaced signals?</B>  
<P>
An interlaced signal is one that draws half the screen at a time, alternating lines.  For example, the odd lines will be drawn, then the even, etc.  The Ovation+944/920 supports interlaced signals at 1024x768 resolution.  
<P>
To determine whether a signal is interlaced, look at the number of lines on the Input Measurements window on the Input Source menu.  If the number of lines is approximately half of the expected resolution, the signal is interlaced.  In addition, the vertical sync rate in the Input Measurements window may not match the vertical sync in the input source.   Interlaced signals can be EVEN or ODD.  If the lines looked swapped in the displayed image, change the Interlaced menu (even or odd.)
<P>
<LI><B>How do I  sync the Ovation+944/920 panel?</B>  
<P>
All adjustments should be made in non-Fit to View mode.  After the image is stable,
 then go to Fit to View mode.  Remember, the sync setting will be different in native and Fit
 to View mode.

<OL TYPE=1, 2, 3, ...>
<LI><B>Is there an easy way to adjust the image automatically?</B><p>
The Automatic Source Mode selection feature works best when you have as much white area on the computer
image as possible.  Automatic Source Mode finds the best position and sync for the input signal.  It then stores it as a custom mode.  Use this feature if you are having trouble syncing in with the standard video selections.<p>

<LI><B>In the Source Mode menu, what do the open check boxes indicate?</B><p>
The open squares to the left of the various source modes indicate which modes are closest to the input signal coming from the computer.<p>

<LI><B>How is the dot clock adjusted on the LightBook?</B><p>
The Sync adjustment combines Dot Clock and Sync in one control.<p>

<LI><B>What type of lamp is used in the LightBook 10 and what is the lamp life?</B><p>
The LB10 lamp is an EVD 36V 400 Watt halogen lamp (Proxima p/n: L82).  The lamp life is estimated at 50 hours.<p>

<LI><B>How is the built-in Help menu accessed?</B><p>

<li><B>I am unable to obtain an image when the DP5600 is connected to a computer or the computer image fades. What do I do?</B><p>

Sometimes the DP5600 is unable to determine the type of signal coming from the computer.  With the <I>remote control</I>:<p>
<ol>
<li> Press MENU.<br>
<li> Choose SETTING, then PC ADJUSTMENT.<br>
<li> Choose any mode to use under the "WHERE TO RESERVE" menu.<br>
<li> Choose MEMORY, then QUIT.<p>
</ol>

<I>NOTE:  The image may go back to the previous settings.  If so, the new mode must be selected. Press MENU, then SYSTEM, then choose SEARCH.</I>  <p>


<LI><B>With the DP5600, my image has dark vertical bands throughout the screen.  How do I correct this (adjust the dot clock)?</B><p>

To adjust the picture, the following procedure must be done with the remote control:<p>
<ol>
<li> Press MENU on the remote control.<br>
<li> Choose SETTING, then PC ADJUSTMENT.<br>
<li> Choose any mode to use under the "WHERE TO RESERVE" menu.<br>
<li> Adjust TOTAL DOTS up or down until the vertical bands disappear.<br>
<li> When finished modifying the parameters, choose MEMORY, then QUIT.<p>
</ol>

<I>NOTE:  The image will go back to the previous settings.  The new mode must be selected.
Press MENU, then SYSTEM, then choose SEARCH.</I>  <p>

<LI><B>Will the DP5600 support an interlaced signal?</B><p>

The DP5600 will support a non-interlaced signal only.  This issue is most noticeable on laptops that 
are VGA and which support 800x600 with an interlaced signal.<p>

<LI><B>How can the image be adjusted on the DP5600 to eliminate flicker?</B><p>

Press MENU on the remote and choose IMAGE.  Adjust the FINE SYNC by increasing or decreasing the current value.<p>

<I>NOTE: Since XGA (1024x768) is compressed to SVGA, some line noise, or flicker, cannot be eliminated by FINE SYNC.</I>

</TABLE>
<P>
<LI><B>Why is the 8400 brighter?</B>
<P>  
-The lamp is brighter--a 190 watt lamp.  <P>
-The new LCD panels have a bigger aperture ratio that allows more light through, resulting in a brighter image.
<P>
<LI><B>Will the 8400 handle VESA VGA signals at 72Hz?</B>  
<P>
Yes.
<P>
<LI><B>Is the 2080 Cyclops different for the 8400?</B>  
<P>
The 2080 Cyclops was reconfigured to work with the brighter 8400 image.  This new 2080 will work with both the 8300 and the 8400.
<P>
<LI><B>The projected image is missing the bottom of the screen image.</B>  
<P>
The graphics mode on the 8400 is set to "Genoa" instead of "VESA".  Press the System button once to see the current setting.  If it is Genoa, press System again to switch to VESA.  
<P>
<LI><B>The projected image looks too bright, too dark or the image is "doubled." Adjusting the brightness and contrast has little or no effect.</B>  
<P>
The 8400 has an impedance-matching terminator switch on the top panel of the projector.  This switch must be set on the projector itself; you can not set it from the remote.  The switch has two settings:  HIGH and 75ohm.   This lets you  match the impedance of the 8400 to the input source.  Usually, the impedance is set to 75ohm for co-axial input and HIGH for other input (i.e. computer input.) <P>  
As a general rule, set it to HIGH or UP when you are using a monitor or terminator and to 75ohm or DOWN otherwise.  With some VGA signals you'll need to change this setting to get an acceptable image.
<P>
<LI><B>Does the 8400 have a switchable power supply?</B>  
<P>
No.  If you want to take a US model overseas, use a power converter rated at 500 WATTS.
<P>
<LI><B>Can the 8400E (European) be used on 110 power?</B>  
<P>
No, the 8400E can not be used with 110 power.
<P>
<LI><B>When calibrating the 2080 Cyclops with the 8400, is there anything special I should do?</B>   
<P>
Use a white or light projected image (for example, a Windows screen with a white background, or a word processor with a white, blank document).   In addition, when calibrating with the laser pointer, during the low beam calibration sequence, gently move the low beam around the brightest spot on the image.

<LI><B>How do I reset the projector?</B>
<P>
With the DP9100 powered on, do the following:<p><ul>
<li>Hold the clear button down for 2 seconds (a white, clear image, then a black clear image will appear).</li><p>
<li>Press the four arrow buttons, beginning with the top and go around clockwise.</li><p>
<li>Wait for the image to blink on.</li><p>
</ul>
<LI><B>How do I connect my workstation to the DP9100?</B><p>
Use the Proxima supplied cable to connect the workstation to the projector.  Use the cable 
supplied by the workstation manufacturer (and a supplied Proxima adapter, if necessary) to connect the projector to the monitor.
<p>

<LI><STRONG>How can I "Fit to View" the projected image?</STRONG>

To set the program keys on the remote control to Fit-to-View: in the Preferences menu, set the appropriate program key to Fit-to-View.
<P>
<LI><B>With a 1280x1024 or 1152x900 input signal, the entire image does not appear on the projector.  How can I display the entire image?</B>  
<P>
The image can be seen in two ways.  The first way is to use the arrow keys to pan the image
 around the projector.  The second way is to use the "Fit to View" feature to compress a 
1280x1024 image to 1024x768.  "Fit to View" is the ability to see the entire 1280x1024
 image on a 1024x768 projection panel.  Note:  When a 1152x900 image is in Fit to View mode, 
a small border will appear around the image.
<P>
<LI><B>Why does the 800x600 image have a black border around it?</B>  
<P>
Since the projector is 1024x768 and the image is 800x600, the area not filled in is black. 
 The Fit to View feature will not change the size of the image.
<P>

		<TD WIDTH=378>Installed as a device driver. </TD>
	</TR>


</TABLE>
<p>
<LI><B>After installing the Cyclops 4.2 driver for Windows 95 on my laptop,  the "Proxima Devices" icon in Control Panel indicates that "No Proxima devices were detected."  Thus, the mouse arrow will not follow the Cyclops wand (or laser).  How is this corrected?</B>
<p>
The Proxima display device must have a stable input video signal that can be viewed on the screen before Windows 95 boots.  If not, the Cyclops 4.2 driver will not detect the Cyclops camera in the Proxima unit.  
<p>
Follow these steps to correct the problem:<p>
<ol>
<li>Connect the Proxima display device to your laptop before powering up either unit.  Now, power up the Proxima display device then the laptop.<br>
<li> Toggle the video signal over to the display device using your laptops appropriate key sequence.  (e.g. Compaq uses Fn + F4, check your laptops Users Guide on how to do this or check our <A HREF="faq_notebook.html">Notebook Video Port Activation Chart</A> on the Internet). <br>
<li> To determine whether the Cyclops driver successfully detected the Cyclops camera, launch the "Proxima Devices" Icon in Control Panel.<br>
<p>
If you see something similar to the following, it was successful:<br>
<B>Proxima Cyclops Driver<br>
Driver version 4.2<br>
Virtual Driver Version: Unknown (requires 1.30 or higher)<br>
Panel ID: 78 (Each display device ID is unique)<br>
Panel Firmware Version: 1.0<br>
Cyclops ID: 3<br>
Cyclops Firmware Version: 1.3<br>
Select OK to update .INI file.</B><br>
<p>
You will see the following if it was unsuccessful:<br>
<B>Proxima Cyclops Driver<br>
Driver version 4.2<br>
Virtual Driver Version: Unknown (requires 1.30 or higher)<br>
No Proxima devices were detected.<br>
Select OK to update .INI file.</B>
<p>
<li>If the Cyclops camera was found, continue on with the Cyclops calibration procedure.
<li>If the Cyclops camera was NOT found, consult the <A HREF="pdfs/Cyclops.pdf">Cyclops Users Guide</A> for troubleshooting information or contact us at 800-447-7694, option 2.
</ol>

<P>
<LI><B>Why is the mouse jumping around the screen?</B>  
<P>
If the computer has an AUX port or QuickPort style mouse and the mouse is jumping around the screen, version 3.01 of the Cyclops driver may not be compatible.  Please contact Technical Support for more information on resolving this issue.
<P>
<LI><B>With a ballpoint mouse and Windows 3.x, how do I set the mouse back to original driver after installing version 3.01 of the Cyclops driver?</B>   
<P>
After you change the mouse driver, the computer tries to go back to original mouse and Windows cannot find it.  Copy MOUSE.DRV (original mouse driver i.e.; from ballpt or bpmouse directory) into WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory.  Choose MS or PS/2 Mouse in Windows SETUP.
<P>
<LI><B>What should I do when the "Cyclops Not Detected" message appears as Windows 3.x is loaded?</B> <P> 
This message means there is no communication between the computer and Cyclops. 
<P>
<TABLE BORDER>
	<TR>
		<TD WIDTH=48 valign = top>1. </TD>
		<TD WIDTH=535>Check the Cyclops camera unit itself. Does Cyclops beep when the projector/panel is turned on? Does it respond to calibration initiation?</TD>
	</TR>

	<TR>
		<TD WIDTH=48 valign = top>2. </TD>
		<TD WIDTH=535>Check the connections/power. Is the Cyclops cable plugged into computer (serial port) and projector/panel (RS 232/Cyclops port)? Is it securely connected?</TD>
	</TR>

	<TR>
		<TD WIDTH=48 valign = top>3. </TD>
		<TD WIDTH=535>Check the serial cable. Are any of the pins on the cable pushed in or bent?</TD>
	</TR>

	<TR>
		<TD WIDTH=48 valign = top>4. </TD>
		<TD WIDTH=535>Check the serial port on the computer. Cyclops must be on COM1 or COM2. Is there an internal modem in the PC? If so, the modem needs to be disabled or set to a com port/IRQ that does not interfere. Is there a PCMCIA card in the PC? If so, it needs to be disabled. To check serial communication, run CYDOS program (on Cyclops installation diskettes, in PROXIMA directory.)</TD>
	</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
Note: With 2020, 2030, and 2060, if you get &quot;Cyclops not detected&quot; message and everything appears fine (serial connections, etc.), disconnect the serial cable and cycle 
power on panel/projector, then reconnect the cable and continue.
<P>
<LI><B>I get the message "This version of pointer options require MOUSE.DRV or later."</B>   
<P>
This is only a notification and does not keep Cyclops from working properly.  This message can be eliminated by editing WIN.INI and removing any reference to pointer.exe from the LOAD= statement.  This will not affect your mouse in any way.
<P>
<LI><B>Which should I turn on first, the projector/panel or the computer?</B>  
<P>
Turn on the projector/panel first, then the computer.  
<P>
<LI><B>Cyclops has been calibrated and the mouse pointer follows the Cyclops pointer, so why can't I click on anything?</B>  
<P>
Check in Windows, Control Panel, Mouse, to see if "Swap Left/Right Buttons" is checked.
  This option should not be checked.  With the Ovation+84X, Ovation+9xx panels and the DP4xxx
 projectors check in the Cyclops menu, Button should be set to LEFT.

<LI><B>How do I remove the white border from my presentation when it is in the PDF format?</B>  
<P>
Follow the steps below to resolve this issue.  In PowerPoint (or other program): <br><p>
<I>Step 1:</I><br>
	<ul>Verify that Acrobat PDFWriter v2.1 is being used.<br>
	Go to File...Print<br>
	Choose the Acrobat PDFWriter driver and click the Properties... button.<br>
	Choose "About.."
<I>	(If the version number is not 2.1, verify that the version of Acrobat Exchange that shipped with 
	MediaExpress was installed)</I></ul>
<p>	
<I>Step 2:</I><br><ul>	Goto File...Slide Setup.<br>
	Change "Slides Sized for:" to On-Screen Show.<br>
	The Image size should be set to 10" by 7.5"<br>
	Verify that the Orientation is set to Landscape.<br>
	Press OK.<br></ul>

<p><I>Step 3:</I><br><ul>
	Go to File...Print<br>
	Choose the Acrobat PDFWriter driver and click the Properties... button.<br>
	Under Page Size, choose Standard and and choose Screen (10 x 7.5 in) 
	Verify Orientation is set to Landscape.<br>
	Press OK and OK again to print out the presentation without the white borders.<br><p></ul>
<LI><B>When I print a PowerPoint presentation as a PDF, PowerPoint seems to hang.
</B>   
<P>
After printing the PDF file, the "Save As" dialog box does not automatically appear
as it should.  Look at the Task Bar (in Win95) or ALT-TAB to the "Save As" dialog box.  
<P>
<LI><B>Can you see a full spreadsheet PDF on the screen?</B>
<P>
Yes, but the spreadsheet may appear to be too small.  You can zoom in on a particular area of screen.  
<P>
<LI><B>How many slides can fit on a single floppy disk?</B>  
<P>
The size of the PDF file depends on the type of presentation.  A standard presentation with minimal
graphics can fit about 400 slides in a single PDF file.  With the Optimizer plug-in, Optimizer will eliminate redundant
bitmaps in the presentation further decreasing the size of the PDF file.

then restart Windows. To set the resolution in Windows 95, select Start, Settings, Control Panel, Display Icon, 

Settings Tab. Select a 640x 480 resolution. </p>

<p>If you are using a laptop with an internal 800x600 screen, you may have to set the resolution to 640x480 and 

run it in external only mode to get an image on the panel or projector. Many laptops with an internal 800x600 

screen drive the internal screen at 800x600 resolution even though you have it set to 640x480. </p>

<p>Graphics cards in PCs can be set at different vertical refresh rates (or vertical sync rates) within the same

laptops. The C937 terminator was specifically made for an Everex laptop that requires pin 11 be terminated to 

get color output. The C936 terminator is automatically shipped with panels. </p>

</li>

<li><b>What is different when using the Zenith Znote?</b> <p>If the panel is on when the computer is turned on, the Znote will send out a signal which the panel locks onto. To 

correct the image, after the panel and the computer are powered up, turn the panel off, then on again. The panel 

should then recognize the signal properly. </p>

</li>

<li><b>What is different when using the NEC Versa laptops?</b> <p>When using the NEC Versa E in simultaneous mode, the display is on the internal screen and the panel. 

However, the image is not clear and appears to have a sync problem. In simultaneous mode, the video signal is 

not strong enough for the panel to fully sync in to the signal. Change the display from simultaneous mode to 

external only mode by pressing the FN and F3 keys. </p>

</li>

<li><b>Do Compaq Q-Vision display drivers work with Proxima panels?</b> <p>The Compaq Qvision Windows display drivers must be configured to use their low refresh rate. Technical 

Support has details on how to do this. </p>

</li>

<li><b>What versions of the panels are compatible with the IBM ThinkPad?</b> <p>Using the new ThinkPads with older panels may cause problems. The H-sync frequency from the newer 

ThinkPads is too low for the panel to recognize. The ColorWorks version 1.7, Ovation 810/820 version 4.0, 

and Ovation 822 version 3.3 or higher will recognize the ThinkPad. MultiMode will not. </p>

</li>

<li><strong>My IBM ThinkPad 760 series PC will not display an image on the Proxima unit.</strong>

<IMG SRC="gifs/new.gif">

<p>

The IBM ThinkPad 760 series has an internal 800x600 TFT display screen. Special instructions are required to 

make the ThinkPad 760 work with Proxima 640x480 resolution panels and projectors.

<p>

Since the ThinkPad comes with Windows 3.1, Windows 95 did not load the appropriate video drivers for the 

Trident Cyber 9320 video card used in the ThinkPad. The driver is available from IBM's BBS (919) 517-0001, or from their web site:

<A HREF="http://www.pc.ibm.com/support/tps/vftpg9.html">http://www.pc.ibm.com/support/tps/vftpg9.html</A>.  The filename is VFTPGW95.EXE.

<p>

If your ThinkPad has the Enhanced Video option (MPEG card) you will need to disable it. From the Programs 

list, open ThinkPad then run ThinkPad Features. Locate the Enhanced Video option and disable it, you will need 

to re-boot after disabling the Enhanced Video mode.</p>

<p>

With the correct video driver loaded in Windows 95 (see above), use the Display; Settings option in Control 

Panel to change the display area to 640x480. Then use FN+F7 to set the video to external only.</p>

</li>

<li><b>My IBM ThinkPad (755 series) signal does not sync in.</b> <p>IBM has acknowledged a video problem with the Thinkpad model numbers 755C and 755. IBM refers to the 

problem as &quot;video jitter.&quot; The problem is fixed by replacing the system board. The new system board part 

number is 85G0993. This service is free of charge. Call Easyserve (IBM service) at 800-772-2227. </p>

</li>

<li><b>Does the AST Premium Exec laptop require a monitor or terminator?</b> <p>Yes, it needs VGA Monitor or Terminator on the &quot;Y&quot; portion of the cable in order to get a projected image. </p>

</li>

<li><b>Does the Gateway Colorbook laptop require anything special to get an image?</b> <p>You may need an adapter between the Colorbook and C454-6 cable to get an image. Technical Support has 

this adapter and can send it to you. Gateway updated their BIOS in May 1994, which seems to have fixed the 

problem. </p>

</li>

<li><b>Harvard Graphics version 3.0 note:</b> <p>The Screen Show driver for Harvard Graphics 3.0 DOS is only 640x350 (not 640x480 as claimed). This 

produces bands at the top and bottom of the image on an Ovation 820. Harvard Graphics 3.0.5 fixes this, but 

causes problems with Cyclops. </p>

</li>

<li><b>My HP OmniBook 5000 will not display an image on the Proxima unit.</b>
<IMG SRC="gifs/new.gif">
<p>On Proxima units which require the use of a 'Y' cable, the OmniBook 5000 requires pin 11
 on the video cable to be terminated.  HP is aware of the issue and currently, can only be
 resolved by using a terminator.  Terminator Kit A41 includes the C937 terminator which is
 needed

to get an image on the Proxima unit.  The kit can be ordered from Proxima Customer Service at 800-447-7694, option 1.</p>

<h3><a name="compmac"><em>Compatibility - Mac</em></a></h3>

<hr>

<ol TYPE="1,">

<li><b>What Macs are compatible with panel/projectors?</b> <p>To get an image on the panel/projector, a 12-, 13-, or 14-inch monitor or C935 terminator must be connected 

(The Ovation+920 will work with 15-inch or greater monitors).</p>

<p>Note: the basic 14-inch monitor uses a standard PC VGA cable with an adapter instead of a Mac cable. This 

adapter comes with the monitor. This VGA adapter must be left on the Mac. Connect the VGA (C454-6) cable 

to the adapter and connect the monitor to the monitor connector. </p>

</li>

<li><b>Is the Mac Power PC compatible?</b> 
<p>The Mac PowerPC has a non-standard video port (45 pin) which requires an adapter to connect to our cable 
(DB15). This adapter comes with the PowerPC (part number 590 0831A) and is about 6-8 inches long.) </p>
<p>NOTE: The Power PC AV (Audio Video Option) models do not need an adapter, because they have a DB15 
port. </p>
</li>
<li><b>What about the Mac PowerBooks?</b> <p>PowerBooks require a monitor or terminator in order to get an image. Use terminator C935 or make a 
terminator with a male DB15 and put a jumper between pins 4 and 11. </p>
<p>Performas and some PowerBooks (models 100, 140, 170) do not have an external video port. These systems 
need a 3rd party device to replicate the video port. Call PowerR at 1-800-729-6970. PowerR offers a variety 
of video adapters for computer systems without external video outputs. </p>
<p>Later PowerBooks (160, 180c and 500 series) have a non-standard video port which requires an adapter to 
connect to our cable (DB15). This adapter comes with the PowerBook. (Adapter part number 590 0831A) The 
adapter is 6-8 inches long. </p>
</li>
<li><b>With the PowerBook, how is the display output to both internal and external displays?</b> <p>The method of controlling whether the internal screen works in addition to the panel is called video mirroring. </p>
<p><em>To control video mirroring, in Control Panel, PowerBook Display, set:</em> </p>
<p>a. Video Mirroring to ON for both internal and external to display image, or to </p>
<p>b. OFF for only external (panel) to display image or internal only, depending on monitor selection in Monitors.<br>
</p>
</li>
<li><b>In video mirroring mode, the projected image has colors that are not correct. </b><p>A problem can occur in mirror mode,and presentation slides are complex. The computer takes longer to project 
the image because the video driver has to write to both the internal and the external screens. To fix this, first turn 
OFF Video Mirroring (see above). Now, select Monitor 2 to be the primary display: </p>
<p><em>Control Panel, Monitors,</em> </p>
<p>a. Monitor 1 = internal, Monitor 2 = external (panel) </p>
<p>b. Select and drag white bar from monitor 1 to monitor 2, display should go to panel. Must restart to take effect. </p>
<p>c. Move mouse to Monitor 1, press and hold down the Option Key. This brings up a small Mac icon. Drag the 
icon to Monitor 2. </p>
<p>d. Close Monitors to effect changes.</p>
</li>
<li><b>When the PowerBook goes into sleep mode, the Proxima logo is projected.</b> <p>Some models of PowerBooks have sleep mode. This is where the PowerBook goes to sleep to conserve 
energy. When this happens during a presentation, the Proxima logo screen will appear. It appears to the 
audience as a &quot;Proxima screensaver&quot;. To turn sleep mode off, go into Control Panel, PowerBook Display (on 
the PowerBook) and turn sleep mode off. </p>
</li>
<li><b>What type of signal comes from the Apple IIGS?</b> <p>Apple IIGS video is a composite signal and works only with DP2300, ColorWorks, and MultiMode. </p>

<LI><B>Which Proxima product will support high resolution workstations?</B>
<P>
The Ovation+ 944/920 and the DP 9100 support workstations such as HP, SGI, Sun and IBM RS6000 with resolutions up to 1280x1024.  
<P>

<IMG SRC="gifs/new.gif">
<P>
Both workstations use the Proxima VGA-LCD cable (C800-6).  The RDI must also use the RDI 13C3-VGA adapter.  
<P>
<LI><B>What is needed to get an RDI PowerLite laptop to work with the Ovation+944/920 or DP 9100?</B>
<IMG SRC="gifs/new.gif">
<P>
RDI PowerLite Unix laptop computer models 85 and 110 manufactured before May 1995 require a PROM fix for compatibility with the Ovation+920 v2.1.  RDI can be reached at 1-800-734-5483. Also, the Ovation+920 must be at firmware v2.1 to get a stable image from the PowerLite.  To check the version on the Ovation+920, look at the bottom right-hand corner of the logo when powered on.

<FONT FACE="CG Times">Subject:  Monitor Display with LCD Panel

Turned Off</FONT>

<P>

<FONT FACE="CG Times">Field Note:  #35<BR>

<BR>

</FONT>

<P>

<FONT FACE="CG Times"> <B>PROBLEM<BR>

</B></FONT>

<P>

Occasionally customers require that the video &quot;Y&quot; cable

remain connected to their computer, but desire to use their computer

system without the LCD panel turned on; however with the panel

turned off, they get no image on the monitor.<BR>



<P>

<B><FONT FACE="CG Times">SOLUTION

</FONT></B>

<P>

<FONT FACE="CG Times">If it is inconvenient to disconnect the

Proxima Video &quot;Y&quot; cable and connect the monitor cable

directly to the computer, there are two solutions:

</FONT>

<P><OL>

<FONT FACE="CG Times"><li> Feedback Adapter

</FONT>

<P>

<FONT FACE="CG Times">A feedback adapter can be constructed to

bypass the LCD panel circuitry and feed the signal to the monitor.

 The disadvantage is that the signal must travel 12 feet (six

feet to the LCD connector and six feet back to the monitor) and

image degradation could result.

</FONT>

<P>

<FONT FACE="CG Times">To construct and use a feedback adapter:

</FONT>

<P>

<OL TYPE=A START=A>

<FONT FACE="CG Times"><li> Obtain a male db25 connector.

</FONT>

<P>

<FONT FACE="CG Times"><li> On the reverse side of the connector

(where the wires of the cable would be soldered), connect jumper

wires between pins 1 &amp; 4, 2 &amp; 5 and 3 &amp; 6. No other

connections are required.

</FONT>

<P>

<FONT FACE="CG Times"><li> On either the C454-6 VGA video cable,

or C464-6 MAC video cable, disconnect the db25 connector from

the LCD panel input and place the feedback adapter on the db25

connector.<BR></OL>

</FONT>

<P>

<FONT FACE="CG Times"><li> Distribution Amplifier <BR>

</FONT>

<P>

<FONT FACE="CG Times">Connect a distribution amplifier (that has

at least two output ports) to the output of the computer video card. Connect the

Proxima video cable to one output and connect the monitor to another

output.</FONT>

<P>

<FONT FACE="CG Times">Advantage - can be left connected at all

times.  The display on the LCD panel and  monitor are independent,

therefore the LCD panel can be turned off and the monitor will

be unaffected.

</FONT>

<P>

<FONT FACE="CG Times">Disadvantage - a more expensive alternative

to the feedback adapter.<BR>

</FONT></OL>

<P>

<B><FONT FACE="CG Times">DISCUSSION<BR>

</FONT></B>

<P>

<FONT FACE="CG Times">PROXIMA LCD video cables are designed to

route the R, G, and B information from the computer video card

 via circuitry inside the LCD panel before being sent to the Computer

Monitor.  The primary purpose of this routing is to alleviate

impedance problems encountered if the input to the monitor and

input to the LCD panel were connected directly in parallel.  Depending

on the computer video card and monitor, incorrect impedance could

cause varying results, none of which would be satisfactory. However,

with the monitor connected to a Proxima video &quot;Y&quot; cable,

the panel must be turned on before the information can be displayed

on the monitor.   With the panel turned off, the signals are not

sent back to the monitor.<BR>

Subject:  Substitute Lens for 8300/8400 Projector

<P>

Field Note: #36

<P>

<U><B>PROBLEM

</B></U>

<P>

In certain installations, customers have indicated that the original

8300/8400 zoom lens is inadequate to display the image size desired.

<P>

<U><B>DISCUSSION

</B></U>

<P>

The installed lens in the 8300/8400 does not produce the desired image

size for a given distance in specific fixed installations.  In

these instances, a wide angle or different zoom lens would produce

the desired image size.

<P>

<U><B>SOLUTION

</B></U>

<P>

BUHL Optical has a selection of wide-angle and zoom lenses that

can replace the original lens in the 8300/8400.  For information, contact:

<P>
<U><B>PROBLEM<BR></B></U>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>When connecting Macintosh computers or some workstations
to the Proxima Ovation+ 920/944 or DP9100 without a monitor or
terminator, you may not obtain the correct resolution.  When this
happens, the Sense Line settings must be used to emulate a monitor.
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<U><B>DISCUSSION<BR>
</B></U>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Some video cards rely on sense line information supplied
by the monitor to determine the signal (resolution) to output
on the video port.  When the video card does not detect the monitor
sense line information, the output signal may default to an unintended
resolution or no signal at all.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Sense Lines Settings within the Proxima Ovation+
920/944 or DP9100 menus can be used to configure the panel to
emulate different types of monitors.  The settings are made on
the Proxima Ovation+ 920/944 or DP9100  before the system is brought
up.  With some of the Macintosh resolutions, a special terminator
is required.  Proxima recommends a programmable terminator produced
by Griffin Communications.  (Contact information for Griffin Communications
is included on page 2.)<BR>

With the glut of information in the world today, anything that enhances communication is a hot commodity.

<B>Real Customers, Sharing Real<br>
Bottom-line Results</B>
<p>
Why is <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> Multimedia Projection technology such a great training tool? Because it allows training to work in real time. The data projected onto the screen or wall is what's running on the presenter's computer, so it can be updated instantly. Using Multimedia Projection for training, since it requires ntohing more than a room big enough to hold all the participants. That makes it cost-effective too. 
<p>

"We've saved tens of thousands of dollars by not having to produce slides," said <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> customer Derrick Hankerson, information services trainer for Blockbuster Entertainment. Rather than printing thousands of handouts or slides, Blockbuster's training department uses <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> Desktop Projectors to present software programs and other training materials developed in Microsoft PowerPoint.

<B>Expanding The Possibilities</B>
<p>
Suppose you could make changes to a sales presentation while you discuss it, then close it and show your audience a video clip of how your product is being used. Or collaborate with colleagues on design reviews. Think of how you could gain consensus more quickly and reduce the number of meetings (!) by actually getting work done when you do meet. You can do all of these things with <font color = "FF0000">Proxima's</font> Desktop Projection products.
<p>
In many companies, groupware applications like Lotus Notes and Microsoft Solutions for Workgroups are becoming an essential part of doing business. At the same time, nearly everyone is establishing a presence on the Internet. Across virtually all industries, more and more computers are linked together in both local-and wide-area networks. As this trend accelerates, the ability to project the contents of your computer screen-including Internet data or even a video conference hook-up with a satellite office- will become more and more useful.
<p>
Perfectly aligned with this trend, <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> Multimedia Projection technology changes the way people work together.  And the possibilities truly are limitless.

<A HREF="../Solutions/proxima.cgi?template=item.html&item=LB10&sction=Description"><IMG SRC="gifs/lightbook.gif" width = 216 height = 180 align = right hspace = 9 border = none alt = "Lightbook Projector"></A>
<p>
<font size = "+1"><font color = "FF0000">PROXIMA</font> CORP. is expanding its two-tier reseller base with the unveiling of a VIP sales-support program.
<p>
The initiative seeks to cultivate partnerships between <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> and resellers by providing VARs with enhanced sales and marketing support.
<p>
The San Diego-based developer, manufacturer and marketer of desktop-projection equipment hopes to increase the number of VARs buying through distribution from 2,000 to 3,000 over the next year.  Among those distributors working with Proxima are Tech Data Corp., Ingram Micro Inc., Merisel Inc. and Access Graphics Inc.
<p>
"We want to ensure resellers are positioned to tap into this $1-billion market," said David Riberi, North American distribution sales manager for <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font>, which sells an array of LCD-projection equipment including projectors, panels and pointer systems.
<p>
The company draws two-thirds of its revenue from 60 Premier VARs that buy directly from <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font>.
<p>
But Riberi said that the two-tier channel presents a wealth of opportunity.
<p>
One goal of the program is to develop a base of 400 VIP resellers whose business would comprise 50 percent of <font color = "FF0000">Proxima's</font> revenue through the two-tier channel.
<p>
"We want to be more visible to resellers working through distribution, and we want our resellers to take a more proactive interest in us," said Riberi.
<p>
The VIP program builds on <font color = "FF0000">Proxima's</font> existing channel program which provides distribution sales representatives who work closely with VARs to help them capture accounts; a <A HREF="free.html">free, 10-day evaluation of Proxima products</A>; and a not-for-resale demo program through which resellers can buy desktop-projection equipment at a discounted rate and rent it out or use it internally for training and presentations.
<p>
The VIP program  offers VARs dedicated sales support, customized marketing support, enhanced demo and evaluation programs, and sales incentives.
<p>
In offering dedicated sales support, the program helps resellers target customers and bolster sales pitches with a well rounded knowledge of what the competition has to  offer.</font><p></td>

Based on Texas Instruments' <A HREF="newdp4100_2.html">Digital Light Processing<sup><font size = "-2">TM</font></sup> (DLP<sup><font size = "-2">TM</font></sup>)</A> technology, they display images that are simply astounding in their clarity, uniformity, and photo-realistic color.
<p>
The DP4100z supports VGA images, offering 315 ANSI lumens in color and 1050 ANSI lumens in grayscale. For even wider computer compatibility, the DP4200z offers true SVGA resolution. It displays 400 ANSI lumens in color and a remarkable 1400 ANSI lumens in grayscale. With a zoom lens and multiple computer, video, and audio inputs, the Desktop Projector 4100z and 4200z are ready for the most demanding multimedia presentations.

<p>
In addition to setting a new standard in image quality, the Desktop Projector 4100z and 4200z are easy to use. Connecting to your computer is truly as simple as plug and play. With built-in keystone correction and simple height adjustment, it's easy to get the best possible image in seconds. The motorized 1.5:1 zoom lens allows you to place these projectors anywhere in the room-front or back-without compromising image quality. When you need to project text-intensive or low-color applications, switch to the grayscale Workgroup mode and more than triple the brightness of your images.
<p>
The Desktop Projector 4100z and 4200z include a <A HREF="../Solutions/proxima.cgi?template=item.html&item=DP2060/2050&sction=Description">Cyclops remote control</A> and Cyclops F/X software. This not only allows you to control the projector and the computer remotely with mouse-like precision, but you can also add transition and special effects to your presentations without going back to your computer.

The MediaExpress system is based on the Adobe&#174 Acrobat&#174 Player<sup><font size = "-2">TM</font></sup> product and the Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF), the cross-platform standard for sharing electronic information. Using the <A HREF="frame_adobe2.html">Adobe Acrobat Exchange<sup><font size = "-2">TM</font></sup> software</A> that is included with the MediaExpress system, you can easily create PDF files on your PC or Macintosh. Then all that you need to do is save the files on a floppy disk and insert the disk in your projector. The MediaExpress system will display your images exactly as they appeared on your computer, no matter what resolution or color.

<B>DP 9100 Applications</B>
<p>
The Desktop Projector 9100 is the perfect solution for demanding high-resolution projection. It offers premium performance for training sessions and workgroups as well as for formal presentations. The Fit-to-View feature displays the entire image--or the "big picture"--all at once, while still providing the ability to show the fine details of that same image. This makes it ideal for projecting CAD/CAM, GIS, command and control, and business graphics images. Imagine how much productivity will improve when the audience can see the entire spreadsheet or solid modeling rendering. What better way to demonstrate software capabilities or train new users than to communicate important concepts to an entire audience from one complete view. The Desktop Projector 9100's intelligent scaling capability projects even the most detailed workstation CAD image with clarity, making it perfect for design reviews or client presentations. And, the compact, rugged design of the Desktop Projector 9100 is a natural fit with portable command and control applications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

<H2><font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> Corporation Reports Third<br>Quarter Results for Fiscal 1997</H2>
</center>

<font size = "+1">SAN DIEGO -- January 20, 1997 -- <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> Corporation (NASDAQ:PRXM), today reported net income of $1,838,000, or 25 cents per share, for the three months ended December 31, 1996, compared with net income of $3,229,000, or 46 cents per share, in the same period last   
year. Revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 1997 increased to $47,365,000 from $44,216,000 in the third quarter of fiscal 1996.
<p>
For the first nine months of fiscal 1997, <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> reported a net loss of $1,693,000, or 24 cents per share, on revenues of $118,625,000 compared with net income of $6,232,000, or 89 cents per share, on revenues of $112,206,000 during the first nine months of the previous fiscal year.
<p>
The Company's earnings performance improved during the third quarter over the second quarter primarily due to a strong ramp-up in sales of the Company's new SVGA multimedia projectors. In addition, shipments of backlog which existed at the beginning of the third quarter positively impacted the quarter's results. Gross margins came in at 29 percent for the third quarter. Actual operating expenses of $11.2 million were essentially flat compared to the second quarter which was consistent with the Company's goal to keep expenses flat with the levels set in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1996. However, as a percentage of revenue, operating expenses dropped to 23.6 percent compared with 30.2 percent in the second quarter.
<p>
Cash and short-term investments increased to $19.0 million compared with   
$17.6 million at September 30, 1996. Accounts receivable increased by $12 million and accounts payable also increased $12 million relative to last quarter. The increase in accounts receivable was due to a higher amount of sales generated during the last half of the quarter. The increase in accounts payable was due primarily to large inventory receipts during the month of December that were not yet paid.
<p>
Inventories rose $3.2 million to $27.4 million in the quarter compared with $24.2 million at September 30, 1996, primarily due to an increase in the inventory levels of sourced Desktop Projectors and components for the Lightbook family.
<p>
"As we expected, demand for SVGA multimedia projectors was strong and represented a significant percentage of our total sales during the quarter ended December 31, 1996," said John Rehfeld, president and chief executive officer of <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font>. Mr. Rehfeld continued, "<font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> was one of the first companies to deliver a true SVGA resolution multimedia projector using polysilicon technology. While we believe that the market for SVGA projectors will experience strong growth, we expect that most of our major competitors will introduce and deliver competitive SVGA products within the next three or four months. With the entry of these new projectors, we expect that price competition will intensify and that our gross margin percentage will trend lower than the 29 percent recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 1997." Mr. Rehfeld also indicated that XGA resolution projectors were beginning to gain market acceptance and that the Company's DP9100 XGA projector was a solid margin contributor during the third quarter.
<p>
<font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> is a leading developer, manufacturer and marketer of multimedia projection products which bring the power of the computer to the workgroup. These systems increase the productivity and effectiveness of business meetings, interactive workgroup sessions, training, and computer-based presentations.</font>

<p>
Important notice:  This press release contains forward- looking statements   
relating to future demand of SVGA multimedia projectors, operating expense goals, gross margins, and the market acceptance of XGA projectors. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of risk factors such as: short product lives, technological shifts, potential technical difficulties (including component/product availability from suppliers) that could substantially delay products at any time, competition (including new and directly competitive products from others), continued downward pricing pressures, demand fluctuations, and the uncertainty of market acceptance of products by both distributors and end-user customers. Further, given the foregoing risks, the Company makes no   
assurance regarding the future success of any of its products. Revenues and earnings in the prior quarter are not an accurate predictor of future results. The Company does not project future financial results and expressly disclaims any responsibility for any such projections released by third party analysts. Investors are strongly encouraged to review the risk factors set forth in the Company's last filed Forms 10-K and 10-Q.

<font size = "+1">SAN DIEGO -- January 10, 1997 -- <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> Corporation (NASDAQ:PRXM), today announced that it has canceled its joint product development effort with Prolux Corporation, a leading designer of advanced technology LCD-based illumination systems.  The original goal of the joint development was to produce a compact multimedia projector that would be optimized for large audience presentations, or high ambient light   
environments.
<p>
"By undertaking a joint development effort with an acknowledged LCD illumination technology expert like Prolux, we had planned to introduce a high brightness multimedia projector in a much shorter period of time," said John Rehfeld, president and CEO of <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font>.  "Although good progress has been made, a later than anticipated product completion date by Prolux and the resulting 'time to market' issues, have caused us to cancel our involvement in this project."

<H2><font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> Introduces New Meeting 
Room Solutions</H2>
<H3>Enhances Meeting Effectiveness with the Tegrity Digital Flipchart</H3>
</center>

<font size = "+1">SAN DIEGO -- November 11, 1996 -- <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> Corporation (NASDAQ:PRXM), a leader in the multimedia projection market, today announced the <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> meeting room solution, featuring the <A HREF="../Solutions/proxima.cgi?template=item.html&item=DFC1N&sction=Description">Tegrity Digital Flipchart<sup><font size = "-2">TM</font></sup></A>.  The new solution revolutionizes work sessions by providing capabilities for capturing decisions, sharing ideas and distributing plans and action items -- creating interactive, productive meetings.
<p>
This innovative solution is a combination of select <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> <A HREF="../Solutions/solutions.html">multimedia projectors</A> and the Tegrity Digital Flipchart, which includes Tegrity's patented Visual Interaction<sup><font size = "-2">TM</font></sup> software, a video camera and video capture card.  The meeting room solution projects a virtual touch panel onto any white surface, which allows you to annotate images and capture anything written on the surface.  This solution records everything from whiteboard brainstorming sessions, marked-up computer documents and annotated video clips.
<p>
"Almost every working session involves the manipulation of various types of information from many multimedia sources," said John Rehfeld, <font color = "FF0000">Proxima's</font> president and CEO.  "This joint solution from <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> and Tegrity eliminates administrative headaches and drives participant action and follow-up through an interactive environment."
<p>
By eliminating the need for detailed note-taking, the meeting room solution increases retention and participation while decreasing miscommunication of action items and decisions.  The meeting information is recorded, and can then be distributed to participants via printing, e-mailing, faxing, or posting to the Internet or company intranet.  In addition, the software furnishes predefined forms, such as Meeting Summary, Agenda, Action Items and Decisions for business meetings.
<p>
"Our patented technology enables anyone to operate Digital Flipchart with great ease.  The meeting room solution is easy to use and is as portable as a paper flipchart," said Daniel Platzker, president and CEO of Tegrity.  "<font color = "FF0000">Proxima's</font> state-of-the-art projection technology effectively complements our application software to meet the needs of the new interactive meeting market segment."
<p>
The Tegrity Digital Flipchart runs on a Pentium-based PC running the Windows<sup><font size = "-1">&#174;</font></sup> 95 operating systems.  Files created with the solution can be viewed and edited on Windows 3.1 or higher, and by a Web browser from virtually any system including Macintosh and UNIX workstations. The meeting room solution is available with many of <font color = "FF0000">Proxima's</font> <A HREF="../Solutions/solutions.html">multimedia projectors</A>, including the <A HREF="newlightbook.html">Lightbook<sup><font size = "-2">TM</font></sup> mobile projector</A> and Desktop Projectors <A HREF="newdp4100z.html">4100</A>, <A HREF="newdp4100z.html">4200</A>, <A HREF="newdp5500.html">5500</A> and <A HREF="newdp5600.html">5600</A>.  Available in November 1996 through authorized resellers and computer products dealers, customers will save $500 when they purchase a <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> projector and the Tegrity Digital Flipchart  together.  <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> multimedia projectors start at $4,999, and the Tegrity Digital Flipchart  begins at $2,495.  All prices are U.S. suggested retail.  For more information please contact <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> Corporation at (800) 447-7692.
<p>
The two companies will demonstrate the new meeting room solution at the Fall Comdex Show in Las Vegas, November 18-22, at the <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> booth (#M428, Sands Convention Center).

<H2><font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> Offers True SVGA 
Polysilicon Projector</H2>
<H3>Lightweight Desktop Projector 5600 Leads the Industry in Brightness</H3>
</center>

<font size = "+1">SAN DIEGO -- November 11, 1996 -- <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> Corporation (NASDAQ:PRXM), a leader in projection technology, today announced the <A HREF="newdp5600.html">Desktop Projector 5600</A> (DP5600), one of the first true SVGA polysilicon projectors available.
<p>
The new projector offers industry-leading brightness at 500 ANSI lumens, making it an excellent choice for presentations to large groups, even in brightly lit rooms.  SVGA capability provides the resolution needed for effective projection of complex spreadsheets, business graphics and photographs.  The projector is also compatible with all domestic and international video standards (NTSC, PAL, SECAM and S-Video), and supports both IBM and Macintosh platforms.
<p>
"The DP5600 fills the demand for true SVGA resolution at 800 x 600 pixels," said John Rehfeld, president and chief executive officer of <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font>.  "Combine that with superior brightness and 16.5-pound weight, and presenters now have a road-worthy projector that will deliver high quality images."
<p>
SVGA resolution (800 x 600 pixels) is standard, and VGA and XGA resolutions are also supported for maximum compatibility.  Stereo audio is supported for both computer and video presentations, with internal speakers and a volume-controlled line level output.  A separate connector is provided for microphone input, which has its own independent volume control.
<p>
Available through <font color = "FF0000">Proxima's</font> authorized resellers, the DP5600 sells for a suggested retail price of $9,999.  For more information please contact <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> at (800) 447-7692. <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> is a leading developer, manufacturer and marketer of multimedia projection products that bring the power of the computer to the workgroup.

<H2><font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> Announces the Lightbook Projector</H2>
<H3>Provides the first multimedia notebook projector built for the road</H3>
</center>

<font size = "+1">SAN DIEGO, California, October 15, 1996 -- <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> Corporation (NASDAQ:PRXM), a leader in the mobile projection market, today announced the <A HREF="newlightbook.html">Lightbook projector</A> -- the industry's first lightweight, multimedia notebook projector built specifically to withstand the rigors of the road.  The Lightbook projector combines a compact, rugged design with best-in-class functionality to provide the ideal solution for the new breed of mobile professional, according to John Rehfeld, <font color = "FF0000">Proxima's</font> chief executive officer.
<p>
"Today's top sales professionals realize the importance technology plays in getting and keeping a competitive advantage.  Good presentation skills are no longer enough to close a deal," Rehfeld said.  "When combined with a laptop computer, the Lightbook projector provides great image quality to turn a good presentation into a winning presentation."  Rehfeld said that while the Lightbook projector was designed to facilitate on-the-road selling, it is also very appropriate for meetings, lectures, and training venues.  Potential users include software salespeople, advertising and public relations agencies, marketing and sales professionals, high-level speakers and trainers, and mobile executives.  "Basically, no matter what business you're in, <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> is your partner for success in on-the-road presentations," said Rehfeld.
<p>
A true multimedia tool, the Lightbook projector provides plug-and-play SVGA image support and handles integrated video with direct connection of a VCR, laser disk, or any other video source.  The Lightbook projector stands alone in terms of durability and portability.  The rugged projector, featuring a full-metal chassis, weighs about 11 pounds, and is small enough to fit inside a small attache case or under an airline seat.  Full presentation and projector control are provided via the <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> Cyclops remote control, which allows users to open files, click on hot buttons, and perform any other mouse action from anywhere in the room; combined with Cyclops F/X software, which enhances presentations with a variety of special effects.  The Lightbook projector's flexible design supports both PC and Macintosh computers, and every Lightbook projector comes ready for worldwide use with an autoswitching power supply for U.S. or European electrical outlets.
<p>
The Lightbook projector will be available through <font color = "FF0000">Proxima's</font> authorized resellers, and sells for a suggested retail price of $4,999.  For more information please contact <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> Corporation at (800) 447-7692.

SAN DIEGO, California,  August 5, 1996 -- <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> Corporation (NASDAQ:PRXM), today announced the company donated two <A HREF="newdp5500.html">Desktop Projector  5500</A> (DP5500) LCD multimedia projectors to the 1996 Republican National Convention for use by headquarters personnel, and on-site at the San Diego Convention Center during the convention here August 12-15.
<p>
According to William I. Greener III, Convention Manager, Republican   
National Convention personnel will use the projectors to integrate   
multimedia, support training, assist in office automation, and enhance   
presentations and videoconferencing as part of their overall convention   
support programs.  "We are very pleased and excited that one of San   
Diego's leading high technology companies was able to provide their   
products for our administrative support efforts," Greener said.   
<p>
"<font color = "FF0000">Proxima's</font> projectors will allow us to incorporate graphics, text, photographs, animation, live video and sound to enhance communications in all our conferences, large and small."
<p>
<font color = "FF0000">Proxima's</font> DP5500, recently announced in June 1996, offers multimedia customers the brightest polysilicon projector on the market (500 ANSI lumens).  Because the DP5500 offers incredibly bright, fully saturated images measuring up to 30 feet diagonally, it can be used to make clear presentations before larger audiences than previously possible with similar projectors.
<p>
The DP5500 includes two independent computer inputs (PC and/or Mac) and   
two independent video inputs, making it simple to connect multiple   
presenters.  It also is designed to make controlling a presentation   
easier.  The DP5500 features a remote control with zoom and focus   
buttons, as well as a "joystick" that provides mouse-like control of a   
PC-compatible computer.  Additional, the DP5500 can handle SVGA (800x600)   
computer images.
<p>
The DP5500 includes as an option <font color = "FF0000">Proxima's</font> <A HREF="../Solutions/proxima.cgi?template=item.html&item=DP2060/2050&sction=Description">Cyclops interactive pointer system</A>, which allows precise point-and-click cordless mouse control of the computer.  The Cyclops system is designed to facilitate better interaction between the presenter and the audience.  The DP5500 is multimedia ready and compatible with all domestic and international video standards (NTSC, PAL and SECAM), as well as S-Video.

<H2><font color = "FF0000">Proxima's</font> Desktop Projectors are<br>Winners at the Olympics</H2>
<H3>Products Brighten Three Venues in Atlanta</H3>
</center>

SAN DIEGO, California,  July 31, 1996 -- <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> Corporation (NASDAQ:PRXM), a leader in multimedia projection technology, is receiving straight 10s in this year's Summer Olympics.  Teamed up with Eastman Kodak Company, an Olympic Gold Sponsor, <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> multimedia projectors have a high profile in three venues in Atlanta:  A Kodak-sponsored Imaging Center located in the massive Main Press Center in downtown Atlanta; the Imaging Expo in Centennial Park; and the Hotel Nikko Hospitality Center.
<p>
The <A HREF="frame_kodak1.html">Kodak Imaging Center</A> is a support area for accredited photographers and journalists, where journalists can view and select the latest digitized photos of Olympic events.  <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> <A HREF="newdp5500.html">Desktop Projector 5500s</A> (DP5500s) are being used to display photos and event results throughout the 20,000-square-foot Center as they come in over the Internet.
<p>
DP5500s are also being utilized at the <A HREF="frame_kodak2.html">Imaging Expo</A> located on the ground floor of the CNN building in Centennial Park - the primary gathering site for the Olympics.  An average of 200,000 people per day come to the Expo to see the latest imaging technology.  <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> projectors are being used to feature Kodak Photo CD technology and digital cameras.
<p>
The third venue, Atlanta's Hotel Nikko, houses a Hands-On Technology Center 
where an estimated 4,000 invited guests of Kodak view presentations of the 
latest technology.
<p>
<font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> introduced the DP5500 in June as the brightest polysilicon projector on the market (500 ANSI lumens).  The projector was selected for the venues in Atlanta because of its ability to offer incredibly bright, fully saturated images that measure up to 30 feet diagonally, making it ideal for multimedia presentations to large audiences.  The projector retains image integrity even in brightly lit rooms.  The projector includes two independent computer inputs (PC and/or Mac) and two independent video inputs, making it simple to connect multiple presenters.  And a remote control with zoom and focus buttons, as well as a "joystick" that provides mouse-like control of a PC-compatible computer, delivers true flexibility. 
<p>
Also included (and sold as an option) is <font color = "FF0000">Proxima's</font> <A HREF="../Solutions/proxima.cgi?template=item.html&item=DP2060/2050&sction=Description">Cyclops</A> interactive pointer system, which allows precise point-and-click cordless mouse control of the computer to facilitate better interaction between the presenter and the audience.

<H2><font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> Corporation Reports Results<br>for First Quarter Fiscal 1997</H2>
</center>

SAN DIEGO, California,  July 23, 1996 -- <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> Corporation (NASDAQ:PRXM) today reported a loss of $4,233,000, or 59 cents per share, for its first fiscal quarter 1997 ended June 30, 1996, compared to net income of $1,648,000, or 24 cents per share, in the same period last   
year.  Revenues for the quarter increased to $35,039,000 compared to   
$32,960,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 1996.
<p>
Included in the first quarter results was a one-time charge of   
$3,905,000, or 54 cents per share, for the write-down of a majority of   
<font color = "FF0000">Proxima's</font> investment in Laser Power Corporation.  There was also a gain, net of income taxes, of $1,581,000, or 22 cents per share, resulting from the sale of the assets of Newpoint Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Proxima, in a cash transaction totaling approximately $7 million.  The Company had a loss from operations net of income taxes of $1,909,000, or 27 cents per share.
<p>
John Rehfeld, president and chief executive officer, commented, "The   
sale of Newpoint's power protection business reflects our commitment to   
focusing our resources on the development of multimedia projection   
products that we believe will lead to the expansion of our market share   
and earnings."
<p>
"We are writing down a majority of our investment in Laser Power   
Corporation because the development of microlaser projectors has been   
slower and more costly than anticipated and the component costs have   
exceeded expectations.  We now believe that the technology will initially   
be suited for the higher-cost specialty projector market, which offers   
much lower unit volumes than originally contemplated."  Rehfeld   
continued, "We still believe that the microlaser technology is   
commercially promising and worthy of additional investigation.  We are   
seeking a partner to participate in the continued development of   
microlasers and to provide additional funding."
<p>
Regarding the quarter's operating results, Rehfeld commented, "As   
anticipated in previous announcements issued by the Company, first   
quarter earnings were impacted due to the transitioning and repositioning   
of new and existing products and by the announcement of new competitive   
products.  Revenues ended higher than we expected due to an increase in   
sales after the INFOCOMM trade show.  However, margins came in at 29   
percent, lower than expected due primarily to the price reductions and   
discounting that occurred during the last few weeks of the quarter."

<H3>Six Recently Introduced Products Will Be Shown at INFOCOMM</H3>
</center>

SAN DIEGO -- June 4, 1996 -- <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> Corporation (NASDAQ:PRXM), expects that revenues and net earnings for its first quarter ending June 30, 1996 will be below earlier expectations.
<p>
"The transition and repositioning of our new and existing products are   
impacting sales and earnings more than we had previously expected.  We   
are having difficulty maintaining the momentum of our older products   
while new products are being introduced by both <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> and our competition,"  said John Rehfeld, president and chief executive officer of <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font>.
<p>
"While we expressed concerns about first quarter performance in our   
<A HREF="press6.html">April 23, 1996 press release</A>, indications now are that revenues could be slightly less than in the same period last year with a loss per share of 25 to 30 cents from operations."  Rehfeld continued, "The timeliness of our new product deliveries is of the utmost importance.  The new products introduced during the first half of our fiscal year are expected to account for over 85 percent of our sales during the second half."  
<p>
<font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> yesterday announced three new products, including the 500 lumen <A HREF="newdp5500.html">Desktop Projector 5500</A>,  the industry's brightest polysilicon-based multimedia projector and the <A HREF="newdp9100.html">Desktop Projector 9100</A>, a compact high-resolution workstation projector.  In addition, the <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> <A HREF="newova944.html">Ovation+ 944</A>, a high-resolution LCD panel, was introduced.  Rehfeld stated,  "These new products along with the recently introduced <A HREF="newdp4100z.html">DP4100z</A>, <A HREF="newdp2910.html">DP2910</A>, and <A HREF="newmedex.html">MediaExpress</A> will be shown next week at INFOCOMM, our most important trade event which will be held at the Pennsylvania Convention Center in Philadelphia.  We have already begun shipping the DP4100 and the DP2910 in limited quantities and expect to begin shipping the other products this month, with the exception of the DP9100 which will begin shipping during the second fiscal quarter."

<A HREF="frame_adobe1.html"><IMG SRC="gifs/adobe_logo.gif" align = right border = none width = 92 height = 72 hspace = 4></A>SAN DIEGO -- June 3, 1996 -- <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> Corporation (NASDAQ:PRXM), a leader in projection technology, today announced the launch of its new <A HREF="../Solutions/proxima.cgi?template=item.html&item=DP5500&sction=Description">Desktop Projector<sup><font size = "-2">TM</font></sup> 5500</A> (DP5500), which offers multimedia customers the brightest polysilicon projector on the market (500 ANSI lumens).  Because the DP5500 is able to offer incredibly bright, fully saturated  images that measure up to 30 feet diagonally, it can be used to make clear presentations before larger audiences than previously possible with similar desktop projectors.
<p>
According to Gerald Hansen, <font color = "FF0000">Proxima's</font> product marketing manager, "The DP5500 takes us to the next level of product performance with two new features not available on our DP5100 model.  First, we've boosted its brightness by 150 ANSI lumens over the previous model, and now we are also able to offer precise, point-and-click control through <font color = "FF0000">Proxima's</font> Cyclops&#174 interactive pointer system."  In practical terms, Hansen said, "With the DP5500, you will never have to worry about lighting conditions in very bright rooms, and since the colors remain fully-saturated and exceptionally sharp at up to 30 diagonal feet, even the biggest images do not appear washed out, faded, or fuzzy."
<p>
The DP5500 includes two independent computer inputs (PC and/or Mac) and two independent video inputs, making it simple to connect multiple   
presenters.  It also is designed to make controlling a presentation   
easier. The DP5500 features a remote control with zoom and focus buttons, as well as a "joystick" that provides mouse-like control of a   
PC-compatible computer.  "This projector is especially flexible," says   
Hansen, "for users who want to take advantage of the 1.6:1 range of the motorized zoom lens, which makes it the widest of any projector lens in its class.  It allows you to position the projector anywhere in the room."  Additionally, the DP5500 can handle SVGA (800x600) computer images.
<p>
The DP5500 includes as an option <font color = "FF0000">Proxima's</font> Cyclops&#174 interactive pointer system, which allows precise point-and-click cordless mouse control of the computer.  The Cyclops system is designed to facilitate better interaction between the presenter and the audience.  The DP5500 is multimedia ready and compatible with all domestic and international video standards (NTSC, PAL and SECAM), as well as S-Video.
<p>
Available through <font color = "FF0000">Proxima's</font> authorized resellers, the Desktop Projector 5500 sells for a U.S. suggested retail price of $9,195.  For more information please contact <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> Corporation at 619/457-5500.  <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> will unveil the DP5500 at the COMDEX Spring show in Chicago (June 3 through June 6), booth number M4130.
<p>
<font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> is a leading developer, manufacturer, and marketer of Desktop  Projection products that bring the power of the computer to the workgroup.  These systems increase the productivity and effectiveness of business meetings, interactive workgroup sessions, training and computer-based presentations.  The company's headquarters are in San

<H2>WORLD'S SMALLEST, BRIGHTEST ACTIVE-MATRIX<BR>HIGH-RES PROJECTOR NOW AVAILABLE FROM <font color = "FF0000">PROXIMA</font></H2>
<H3>Desktop Projector 9100 Projects Fine Detail and Brilliant, 24-Bit Color</H3>
</center>

SAN DIEGO -- June 3, 1996 -- <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> Corporation (NASDAQ:PRXM), a leader in projection technology, today announced the latest member of its Desktop Projector family -- the <A HREF="../Solutions/proxima.cgi?template=item.html&item=DP9100&sction=Description">Desktop Projector 9100</A>.   Designed for visually demanding applications such as complex spreadsheets, business graphics, GIS and CAD, the new projector supports all popular PC, Macintosh, and workstation systems.  
<p>
According to Michael Chaffin, chief operating officer at <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font>, "The DP9100 is so easy to use and to travel with that it sets a whole new set of expectations for high-resolution projection.  And the viewing features are unprecedented, both in terms of true-resolution viewing and full-image viewing."  Full-image viewing of all resolutions of computer and video images is accomplished through <font color = "FF0000">Proxima's</font> Fit-to-View technology, which can enlarge a VGA 640x480 image to fill the entire XGA 1024x768 screen.  It can also intelligently scale down a 1280x1024 image for complete viewing without sacrificing the integrity of the data.  And true-resolution viewing, with exact pixel-by-pixel representation and fast image panning, is available for resolutions higher than 1024x768.
<p>
The optional <A HREF="../Solutions/proxima.cgi?template=item.html&item=MediaExpress&sction=Description">MediaExpress</A> feature provides an integrated electronic presentation system without a computer.  By simply inserting a 3.5-inch PC formatted floppy into the DP9100, users can display images created in any software application on any system. And on the DP9100, images created on a VGA system are automatically rendered at XGA resolution on the projector. MediaExpress is based on the Adobe&#174; Acrobat&#174; Player product and Adobe's Portable Document Format (PDF), the cross-platform standard for sharing electronic information.
<p>
The Desktop Projector 9100 includes as an option <font color = "FF0000">Proxima's</font> Cyclops&#174; interactive pointer system, which allows precise point-and-click cordless mouse control of a PC or workstation.  The <A HREF="../Solutions/proxima.cgi?template=item.html&item=DP2060/2050&sction=Description">Cyclops</A> system is designed to facilitate better interaction between the presenter and the audience.  "Making eye contact with the audience and taking advantage of other non-verbal cues is easier when the presenter is able to interact freely with the audience," Chaffin said.  "In providing that capability, the Cyclops system becomes a part of a total, integrated solution for desktop projection technology."  The Cyclops pointer system is supported on PC, Macintosh, Sun, SGI and HP platforms.  In addition, the DP9100 comes with a Cyclops multifunction remote and Cyclops F/X software for controlling the projector's controls and the presentation, as well as <font color = "FF0000">Proxima's</font> LightBoard drawing tools for on-screen annotation.  The DP9100 is also multimedia ready, compatible with all domestic and international video standards (NTSC, PAL and SECAM), as well as S-Video, and has two rear-facing stereo speakers.
<p>
Available mid-summer through <font color = "FF0000">Proxima's</font> authorized resellers, the Desktop Projector 9100 sells for a suggested retail price of $16,995.  For more information please contact <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> Corporation at 619/457-5500.

<font color = "FF0000">PROXIMA'S</font> SETS NEW STANDARD FOR EASE OF<br> USE WITH  REVOLUTIONARY MEDIAEXPRESS<br> PRESENTATION SYSTEM</H2>
<H3>MediaExpress with Adobe Acrobat Player Delivers 
Cross-Platform, Cross-Application, Worry-Free Projection</H3>
</center>

SAN DIEGO -- (May 15, 1996) -- <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> Corporation (NASDAQ:PRXM), today set a new standard for ease of use in electronic presentations with the announcement of its revolutionary <A HREF="../Solutions/proxima.cgi?template=item.html&item=MediaExpress&sction=Description">MediaExpress</A> worry-free presentation system.  The first standalone electronic presentation system to incorporate <A HREF="frame_adobe1.html">Acrobat Player technology</A> from Adobe Systems, Incorporated, MediaExpress provides cross-platform, cross-application, plug-and-play projection for large-screen, interactive presentations and workgroup sessions.
<p>
"MediaExpress is revolutionary in that it simplifies both the creation and delivery of electronic information," said Terry Hicks, product line manager.   "It lets you use your favorite software and any computer platform to create your presentation, then allows you to make that presentation without a computer--or even any cables to fuss with other than the power cord--merely by inserting your disk in the projector."  
<p>
Designed to work with <font color = "FF0000">Proxima's</font> new digital light processing <A HREF="newdp4100z.html">Desktop Projector 4100z</A>, MediaExpress will ultimately be available as an option on several <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> desktop projection products.  The completely portable system lets users project documents based on the Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF), a universal file format that preserves the fidelity of visually rich information across computer platforms regardless of resolution, color depth, or the fonts used.
<p>

<table border = 4>
	<tr>
		<td align = center><font size = "+1">&#160Download a colorful <A HREF="medexpr.pdf"><IMG SRC="gifs/pdf_logo.gif" width = 28 height = 31 border = none></A> file of this <A HREF="medexpr.pdf">Press Release</A>. </td>
	</tr>
</table>
</center>
<p>
<B>Simple as Printing</B>
<p>
The MediaExpress system works with any computer or application software that can be saved to a PDF file.  Tools for creating PDF files are included in <A HREF="frame_adobe2.html">Adobe Acrobat Exchange software</A>, which comes with the MediaExpress system.  According to Hicks, the procedure for saving a PDF file is as simple as printing a document.  "With Adobe Acrobat software resident on your computer, you simply create your document and save it as a PDF file by hitting 'print' on your file menu," he explained.  "Once you've copied your document onto a disk, you then insert the disk into the projector and the Adobe Acrobat rendering engine that resides within MediaExpress opens and plays it back.  
<p>
"Within seconds," he added, "you are displaying your message using rich text and graphics from your favorite PC or Mac application.  Users thus are assured of worry-free support for a wide range of resolutions and projection applications."     
<p>
In addition, unlike existing presentation systems, which are tied to specific software packages, MediaExpress is not limited in the kinds of information it can display.  Because it is compatible with any software or hardware platform, users can incorporate content created with virtually any software package.
<p>
<B>Content Flexibility</B> 
<p>
But the ability to create presentations on any software is only part of the story.  As Hicks explained, "you can even add content later from any PDF file, add links and transitions, as well as rearrange slides.  This gives you the flexibility to combine elements from multiple applications as necessary and then organize your material for more effective delivery." 
<p>
In addition, because Acrobat Player displays files in Adobe's resolution-independent PDF format, MediaExpress provides compatibility with all computer platforms regardless of application, resolution, or fonts.  Any projector equipped with MediaExpress always projects images at the best possible resolution, and preserves the integrity of your design, including formatting and positioning true to the original documents. 
<p>
Because Adobe Acrobat software uses a variety of compression technologies to reduce file size, users have the ability to share visually rich information in a very compact form--up to 400 simple text slides on one floppy disk!  PDF thus provides a convenient means of storing, transporting and sharing information.   
<p>
<B>Expanding the Market</B>
<p>
Because it removes the fears many people have of making an electronic presentation, MediaExpress will help to expand the market for desktop projection products.  As Hicks pointed out, the use of electronic presentations is still in the early adopter phase.  
<p>
"Fear of technology limits a huge number of people from taking advantage of this technology," he said.  "With its numerous cables and switches, they perceive that it's too complex, that they won't be able to set it up or operate it, or that the system will fail and they won't know how to fix it."
<p>
This helps to explain the figures released by Pacific Media Associates of Mountain View Calif., which show that the install base of presentation-creation software versus projectors is more than 25:1.  As Hicks noted, "that leaves a huge range of potential users who are comfortable authoring on a PC or Mac, but who are not comfortable hooking the devices up to another machine to share information with a group."  
<p>
<B>New and Existing Users</B>
<p>
With its unprecedented ease of use, bullet-proof reliability, ability to project images of the highest quality and increased content flexibility, MediaExpress is intended for both new and existing users.  "Because it's faster and better, new users will find it irresistible," said Hicks.  "And it's so easy current users will quickly convert."  
<p>
As a result, Hicks said <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> Desktop Projectors equipped with MediaEpress will be used as multi-department, multi-user systems in a wide range of applications.  These include business and sales presentations, software demonstrations, education and training, interactive workgroup meetings and mobile presentations.  
<p>
Users who aren't comfortable setting up equipment, or who prefer not to use a laptop during a presentation, will find MediaExpress the perfect solution, as will anyone with a fixed message to communicate.  Moreover, the speed with which the system can be set up, as well as its worry-free reliability, will make it an invaluable asset to both frequent and occasional presenters.
<p>
<font color = "FF0000">Proxima's</font> MediaExpress system will begin shipping late May as an option available on all models of the Desktop Projector 4100.  Prices are as follows:  Floppy only (ME40F):  $1,495; Floppy with hard drive (ME40H):  $1,995.  All prices are U.S. suggested retail.
<p>
<font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> Corp. is a leader in desktop projection for large-screen, interactive presentations and workgroup sessions.  Headquartered in San Diego, Calif., the company designs, manufactures and markets a full line of award-winning LCD projection panels, LCD projectors and interactive presentation control systems.

<H3><font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> Revolutionizes Presentations With New DP 4100</H3>
</center>

SAN DIEGO -- (May 15, 1996) -- <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> Corporation (NASDAQ:PRXM), today announced the <A HREF="../Solutions/proxima.cgi?template=item.html&item=DP4100z&sction=Description">Desktop Projector 4100</A>, a Digital Light Processing data and video projector whose combination of phenomenal image quality, worry-free operation, and system flexibility revolutionizes the industry.  
<p>
Available with or without a zoom lens, the Desktop Projector 4100 is the first projector in its class to combine two exciting new technologies in one unit:  Digital Light Processing (DLP) from <A HREF="frame_ti.html">Texas Instruments Incorporated</A> and Acrobat&#174; Player from <A HREF="frame_adobe1.html">Adobe&#174; Systems Incorporated</A>.  The latter is the core technology of the company's optional <A HREF="press11.html">MediaExpress</A> system.<br clear = all>
<p>
"By combining the superior image quality of DLP technology with the cross-platform, cross-application, plug-and-play capabilities of <A HREF="frame_adobe1.html">Adobe Systems Acrobat Player</A>, the DP4100 achieves a new level of performance," said Gerald Hansen, <font color = "FF0000">Proxima's</font> product line manager.  "Add to that the advanced control features of <font color = "FF0000">Proxima's</font> Cyclops&#174; interactive pointer system and the result is a multimedia projection system that clearly expands the desktop projection marketplace."
<p>
The Desktop Projector 4100 projects 16.7 million true colors, incorporates 24-bit video processing and is rated at 350 ANSI lumens for lights-on projection. But the heart of the new projector is its innovative digital light processing projection engine.  "Simply put," said Hansen, "DLP technology produces images whose color accuracy, clarity and uniformity of illumination are superior to anything heretofore available in a Desktop Projection device."

</center>
<p>
<B>Photo-Realistic Images</B>   
<p>
Hansen explained that LCD images are dependent on the physical characteristics of an LCD element, whereas DLP employs an array of digitally switched micromirrors that precisely reflects the light.  "With the colors for each pixel digitally defined and displayed," he said, "DLP is capable of projecting images of photo-realistic quality." 
<p>
Compatible with virtually all popular IBM, IBM-compatible and Macintosh computers, the plug-and-play DP4100 comes with an intuitive user interface whose familiar look and feel is readily accessible.  
<p>
Moreover, with <font color = "FF0000">Proxima's</font> optional MediaExpress System installed, users need only connect the power cord and insert their diskette to present.  No additional cables or even a computer are needed.  The projector also comes with monitor video loop-through for convenient video set-up with no Y-cables.  
<p>
Because the new projectors are compatible with <font color = "FF0000">Proxima's</font> amazing Cyclops, users can control their computer applications from the projection screen or from anywhere in the room.   In addition, the DP4100 comes with a Cyclops multi- function remote for controlling both the projector's controls and the presentation, as well as <font color = "FF0000">Proxima's</font> LightBoard<sup><font size = "-2">TM</font></sup> drawing tools for on-screen annotation.  Weighing just 26 pounds, the compact, lightweight projector is ideal for use as a multi-department device, as well as for mobile presentations.  Adding to its flexibility are such features as rear projection, ceiling mountable installation, multiple computer and video inputs for simultaneous use by multiple users,  superior keystone correction, and an optional motorized zoom-lens that allows placement in nearly any room configuration.  The projector is also compatibile with all domestic and international video standards (NTSC, PAL, and SECAM), as well as S-VHS.
<p>
<B>Innovative Features</B> 
<p>
The DP4100 comes with an array of innovative features.  For example, the projector's Workgroup Mode<sup><font size = "-2">TM</font></sup> enables users to nearly quadruple its brightness for monochrome, high-detail applications such as spreadsheets or text-intensive documents.  And an optional transmitter allows audio to be broadcast to optional remote stereo speakers, eliminating the need for additional speaker cabling.   
<p>
Designed for use in both large and small conference rooms, under the most challenging lighting conditions, <font color = "FF0000">Proxima's</font> Desktop Projector 4100 is the perfect tool for business and sales presentations, mobile presentations, software demonstrations, education and training, interactive workgroup meetings and mobile presentations.  With the addition of MediaExpress, it is ideal for users who aren't comfortable setting up equipment, or who prefer not to use a laptop during presentations, as will anyone with a fixed message to communicate.   
<p>
Available through authorized resellers and computer products dealers, the new projector is priced at $9,495.  The zoom lens version (DP4100Z) is priced at  $9,995.  All prices are U.S. suggested retail.
<p>
<font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> Corp. is a leader in desktop projection for large-screen, interactive presentations and workgroup sessions.  Headquartered in San Diego, Calif., the company designs, manufactures and markets a full line of LCD projection panels, integrated data and video projectors and interactive presentation control systems.

<H2><font color = "FF0000">PROXIMA</font> CORPORATION INTRODUCES<br>INDUSTRY'S BRIGHTEST LCD MULTIMEDIA PROJECTOR</H2>
<H3>New Desktop Projector 2910 features 650 ANSI Lumens</H3>
</center>

SAN DIEGO -- (May 8, 1996) -- <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> Corporation (NASDAQ:PRXM), a leader in projection technology, today announced the introduction of the <A HREF="../Solutions/proxima.cgi?template=item.html&item=DP2910&sction=Description">Desktop Projector 2910</A> -- the industry's brightest LCD multimedia projector.  The new projector provides accurate, high-quality projection of computer and video images rated at an unprecedented 650 ANSI lumens, according to Michael Chaffin, <font color = "FF0000">Proxima's</font> chief operating officer.  This extraordinary brightness fulfills long-standing market requirements for clear projection in presentations to large audiences and in high ambient light environments.
<p>
The newest member of <font color = "FF0000">Proxima's</font> award-winning Desktop Projector product line, the DP2910 is an enhanced version of the DP2900 projector.  The new model offers refinements in uniformity and consistency, and also provides a more efficient cooling system and quieter operation.  Connected to a PC-compatible or Macintosh computer, the DP2910 projects clear, brilliant images at VGA resolution (640-by-480 dpi) in 2 million colors from a palette of 16.7 million colors.  It can also display most SGVA images (800-by-600 dpi) in a windowed view.
<p>
"The DP2910 effectively establishes a new image brightness standard for LCD multimedia projectors," Chaffin said.  "With this projector, presenters can deliver dynamic computer-based presentations without darkening the room, allowing them to maintain the eye contact with their audiences that is so vital to the overall impact of their communications."
<p>
The DP2910 weighs just over 22 pounds, and incorporates advanced ergonomics and a compact design that offers virtually the same user-friendly interface as a standard desktop computer peripheral.  In addition, it includes a stereo audio output system and state-of-the-art digital video controller that projects exceptionally sharp, uniform video images in all three international video standards (NTSC, PAL, and SECAM), as well as S-VHS.
<p>
By adding <font color = "FF0000">Proxima's</font> optional <A HREF="../Solutions/proxima.cgi?template=item.html&item=DP2060/2050&sction=Description">Cyclops&#174;</A> interactive pointer system, which functions as a cordless mouse, users essentially have a complete, all-in-one desktop projection solution.  "With Cyclops, presenters can pull down menus, open files, and perform other interactive  tasks from up to 40 feet away from their computer," said Chaffin.
<p>
The DP2910 is designed to meet the needs of corporate and individual users in both presentation and workgroup applications.  In addition to being ideal for use in larger conference rooms under challenging light conditions, the compact, light-weight projector fits easily into an airplane overhead luggage compartment.  "It's the perfect tool for traveling executives, field sales people, corporate presenters and trainers in a variety of industries, as well as educators and government professionals," Chaffin said.
<p>
Available through <font color = "FF0000">Proxima's</font> authorized resellers, the DP2910 sells for a suggested retail price of $7,995 U.S.  For more information please contact Proxima Corporation at 619/457-5500.

<H2><font color = "FF0000">PROXIMA</font> CORPORATION REPORTS<br>FOURTH QUARTER FISCAL 1996 RESULTS</H2>
<H3>Record Fourth Quarter and Annual Revenues</H3>
</center>

San Diego, California,  April 23, 1996 . . . <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> Corporation (NASDAQ: PRXM) today announced that revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1996, increased 18 percent over last year.   For fiscal year 1996, <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> reported net income of $9,690,000, or $1.37 per share, on revenues of $159,797,000, compared to net income of $13,109,000, or $1.91 per share, on revenues of $135,750,000 in fiscal 1995.
<p>
For the fourth quarter ended March 31, 1996, <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> reported net income of $3,458,000, or 47 cents per share, on revenues of $47,591,000, compared to net income of $3,930,000, or 56 cents per share, on revenues of $40,746,000 in the same period last year.
<p>
John E. Rehfeld, president and chief executive officer of <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> since February 1996, states, "With an ample supply of most of our leading products, we achieved record revenues in the fourth quarter.  The past   
due backlog of DP5100s, which had been in short supply, was nearly eliminated and overall backlogs were reduced by about 40 percent.
<p>
"Price cutting and discounting in the market increased in the month of   
March and slowed our incoming order rates.  While we reduced prices late   
in the quarter and shipped a record number of  the lower margin DP5100s,   
the lower average selling prices were almost entirely offset by lower   
component and manufacturing costs resulting in gross margins of 38   
percent.  Although gross margins were strong in the quarter, we expect to   
see margins in the mid to low thirties during the first half of fiscal   
year 1997.  With the transition and repositioning of both new and   
existing products, sales and earnings will be significantly impacted   
during the first half of the year.  For the current quarter, the Company   
is expecting revenues above the level achieved in the same period last   
year, but below the level achieved in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1996,   
and earnings may be as low as break-even.   However, we expect the new   
products to help <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> establish a strong position in the market for the second half of the year."
<p>
Rehfeld further comments, "In fiscal year 1997, we are committed to   
broadening our product line,  increasing our global distribution, and increasing operational efficiencies.  We have already made progress in each of these areas, and you should see the results of these efforts within the next few quarters.   We will soon be introducing several new projectors that will offer features that will differentiate our products from the competition.  These projectors will each use one of the following light-valve technologies:  amorphous silicon, polysilicon, and Texas Instruments' Digital Light Processing.  Included in this new set of products will be a high-resolution workstation projector for the engineering conference room."

SECOND QUARTER FISCAL 1997 RESULTS</font>

<p>
</center>

San Diego, California,  October 21, 1996 -- <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> Corporation (NASDAQ:PRXM) today reported net income of $702,000, or 10 cents per share, for the three months ended September 30, 1996, compared to net income of $1,355,000, or 20 cents per share, in the same period last year.  Revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 1997 increased to $36,221,000 from $35,030,000 in the second quarter of fiscal 1996.
<p>
For the first six months of fiscal 1997, <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> reported a net loss of $3,531,000, or 51 cents per share, on revenues of $71,260,000 compared to a gain of $3,003,000, or 43 cents per share, on revenues of $67,990,000 during the first six months of the previous fiscal year.
<p>
The Company's earnings performance improved during the second quarter primarily due to lower component and product costs and lower operating expenses.  Gross margins rose to 31.5 percent from 28.8 percent in the first quarter.  Operating expenses as a percent of revenue dropped to 30.2 percent in the quarter compared to 37.1 percent in the first quarter.  Contributing to the decrease in operating expenses were the divestiture of Newpoint Corporation and progress toward our goal of keeping expenses flat with the levels set in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1996.
<p>
Cash and short-term investments decreased to $17.6 million, compared with $29.2 million at June 30, 1996.  Accounts receivable increased by $9 million and accounts payable fell $7 million relative to last quarter. The increase in gross receivables was primarily due to a higher amount of sales generated during the last half of the quarter.
<p>
Inventories fell $3.4 million to $24.2 million in the quarter compared to $27.6 million at June 30, 1996, primarily due to a reduction in the inventory levels of older model Desktop Projectors and projection panels.   
<p>
"As we expected, our new products represented a majority of our total sales during our quarter ended September 30, 1996," said John Rehfeld, president and chief executive officer of <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font>.  Mr. Rehfeld continued, "We were able to introduce six new products in six months and transition them into our product mix.  Our new products accounted for 55 percent of revenues during the quarter.  Demand for our 500-lumen <A HREF="../New/newdp5500.html">DP5500 polysilicon projector</A> and the <A HREF="../New/newdp9100.html">DP9100 workstation projector</A> was strong in September.   
<p>
However, low yields of XGA panels caused shipments of our DP9100 to fall   
below demand.  On September 18 at the Photokina trade show in Germany, we   
introduced our lightweight, multimedia <A HREF="../New/newlightbook.html">Lightbook projector</A> to the European market.  On October 15, 1996, we introduced Lightbook in North America and to the rest of the world."
<p>
Dennis Whittler, <font color = "FF0000">Proxima's</font> chief financial officer, stated, "We have made the very difficult decision to cancel both our fiscal second quarter analysts' conference call and an important analyst conference at the end of the month due to the increased exposure to frivolous lawsuits that would result if a California initiative, known as Proposition 211, passes on November 5, 1996."  Whittler continued, "It has been our policy to actively communicate to investors by encouraging investors to visit the company, holding analysts' conference calls each quarter, meeting individually with investors on "road trips", and making presentations at analysts' and brokers' conferences.
<p>
"Although we don't make financial projections, we believe that it is important to openly discuss our marketplace and strategies to help analysts and other investors independently evaluate the outlook for <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font>.  Federal reform legislation passed in 1995 was designed to protect companies that communicate with investors from frivolous lawsuits.  Proposition 211 would circumvent many of the provisions of the federal reform legislation.
<p>
"In addition to undermining the federal reforms, Proposition 211 lowers the current standard for liability, allows for speculative punitive damages, and prohibits companies from indemnifying their directors and officers from liability for even unintentional acts or omissions.   
<p>
Because of the increased risks to <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font>, we are taking action now and plan to re-evaluate our investor communications program pending the resolution of Proposition 211."
<p>
<font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> is a leading developer, manufacturer and marketer of multimedia projection products which bring the power of the computer to the workgroup.  These systems increase the productivity and effectiveness of business meetings, interactive workgroup sessions, training, and computer-based presentations.

</font>
<p>
Important notice:  Revenues, earnings, and gross margins in the prior quarter are not an accurate predictor of future results.  The Company makes no assurance regarding the future success of its new products due to risks including: short product lives, technological shifts, technical difficulties (including component/ product availability from suppliers) that could substantially delay new products at any time, competition (including new and directly competitive products from others), pricing pressures, and the uncertainty of market acceptance of new products by both distributors and end-user customers.  The Company does not project future financial results and expressly disclaims any responsibility for any such projections released by third party analysts.  Investors are strongly encouraged to review the risk factors set forth in the Company's last filed Forms 10-K and 10-Q.

FIRST QUARTER FISCAL 1997 RESULTS</font>
<p>
</center>

<font size = "+1">
San Diego, California,  July 23, 1996 -- <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> Corporation (NASDAQ:PRXM) today reported a loss of $4,233,000, or 59 cents per share, for its first fiscal quarter 1997 ended June 30, 1996, compared to net income of $1,648,000, or 24 cents per share, in the same period last year.  Revenues for the quarter increased to $35,039,000 compared to $32,960,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 1996.
<p>
Included in the first quarter results was a one-time charge of $3,905,000, or 54 cents per share, for the write-down of a majority of <font color = "FF0000">Proxima's</font> investment in Laser Power Corporation.  There was also a gain, net of income taxes, of $1,581,000, or 22 cents per share, resulting from the sale of the assets of Newpoint Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Proxima, in a cash transaction totaling approximately $7 million.  The Company had a loss from operations net of income taxes of $1,909,000, or 27 cents per share.
<p>
John Rehfeld, president and chief executive officer, commented, "The sale of Newpoint's power protection business reflects our commitment to focusing our resources on the development of multimedia projection products that we believe will lead to the expansion of our market share and earnings."
<p>
"We are writing down a majority of our investment in Laser Power Corporation because the development of microlaser projectors has been   
slower and more costly than anticipated and the component costs have   
exceeded expectations.  We now believe that the technology will initially   
be suited for the higher-cost specialty projector market, which offers much lower unit volumes than originally contemplated."  Rehfeld continued, "We still believe that the microlaser technology is commercially promising and worthy of additional investigation.  We are seeking a partner to participate in the continued development of microlasers and to provide additional funding."
<p>
Regarding the quarter's operating results, Rehfeld commented, "As anticipated in previous announcements issued by the Company, first quarter earnings were impacted due to the transitioning and repositioning of new and existing products and by the announcement of new competitive products.  Revenues ended higher than we expected due to an increase in sales after the INFOCOMM trade show.  However, margins came in at 29 percent, lower than expected due primarily to the price reductions and discounting that occurred during the last few weeks of the quarter."
<p>
<font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> Corporation, headquartered in San Diego, is a leading manufacturer of multimedia projection products which bring the power of the computer to the workgroup.  These systems increase the productivity and effectiveness of business meetings, interactive workgroup sessions, training, and computer-based presentations.

San Diego, California,  June 4, 1996 -- <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> Corporation (NASDAQ:PRXM), expects that revenues and net earnings for its first quarter ending June 30, 1996 will be below earlier expectations.

<A HREF="financial2.html">April 23, 1996 press release</A>, indications now are that revenues could be slightly less than in the same period last year with a loss per share of 25 to 30 cents from operations."  Rehfeld continued, "The timeliness of our new product deliveries is of the utmost importance.  The new products introduced during the first half of our fiscal year are expected to account for over 85 percent of our sales during the second half."  
<p>
<font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> yesterday announced three new products, including the 500 lumen <A HREF="../New/newdp5500.html">Desktop Projector 5500</A>,  the industry's brightest polysilicon-based multimedia projector and the <A HREF="../New/newdp9100.html">Desktop Projector 9100</A>, a compact high-resolution workstation projector.  In addition, the <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> <A HREF="../New/newova944.html">Ovation+ 944</A>, a high-resolution LCD panel, was introduced.

FOURTH QUARTER FISCAL 1996 RESULTS</font>

<B>Record Fourth Quarter and Annual Revenues</B>
<p>
San Diego, California,  April 23, 1996 . . . <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> Corporation (NASDAQ: PRXM) today announced that revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1996, increased 18 percent over last year.   For fiscal year 1996, <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> reported net income of $9,690,000, or $1.37 per share, on revenues of $159,797,000, compared to net income of $13,109,000, or $1.91 per share, on revenues of $135,750,000 in fiscal 1995.
<p>
For the fourth quarter ended March 31, 1996, <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> reported net income of $3,458,000, or 47 cents per share, on revenues of $47,591,000, compared to net income of $3,930,000, or 56 cents per share, on revenues of $40,746,000 in the same period last year.
<p>
John E. Rehfeld, president and chief executive officer of <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> since February 1996, states, "With an ample supply of most of our leading products, we achieved record revenues in the fourth quarter.  The past due backlog of DP5100s, which had been in short supply, was nearly   
eliminated and overall backlogs were reduced by about 40 percent.
<p>
"Price cutting and discounting in the market increased in the month of   
March and slowed our incoming order rates.  While we reduced prices late   
in the quarter and shipped a record number of  the lower margin DP5100s,   
the lower average selling prices were almost entirely offset by lower   
component and manufacturing costs resulting in gross margins of 38   
percent.  Although gross margins were strong in the quarter, we expect to   
see margins in the mid to low thirties during the first half of fiscal   
year 1997.  With the transition and repositioning of both new and   
existing products, sales and earnings will be significantly impacted   
during the first half of the year.  For the current quarter, the Company   
is expecting revenues above the level achieved in the same period last   
year, but below the level achieved in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1996,   
and earnings may be as low as break-even.   However, we expect the new   
products to help <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> establish a strong position in the market for the second half of the year."
<p>
Rehfeld further comments, "In fiscal year 1997, we are committed to   
broadening our product line,  increasing our global distribution, and   
increasing operational efficiencies.  We have already made progress in   
each of these areas, and you should see the results of these efforts   
within the next few quarters.   We will soon be introducing several new   
projectors that will offer features that will differentiate our products   
from the competition.  These projectors will each use one of the   
following light-valve technologies:  amorphous silicon, polysilicon, and   
Texas Instruments' Digital Light Processing.  Included in this new set of   
products will be a high-resolution workstation projector for the   
engineering conference room."

<B>Record order rates and record backlog were attained</B>
<p>
San Diego, California, January 22, 1996 . . . <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> Corporation (NASDAQ:PRXM) today reported net income of $3,229,000 , or 46 cents per share, for the three months ended December 31, 1995, compared to net income of $3,879,000, or 55 cents per share, in the same period last   
year.  Revenue for the quarter increased to $44,216,000 from $36,240,000   
in the third quarter of fiscal 1995.
<p>
 For the first nine months of fiscal 1996, net income was $6,232,000, or   
89 cents per share, on revenues of $112,206,000 compared to $9,179,000,   
or $1.35 per share, on revenues of $95,004,000 during the same period of   
fiscal 1995.
<p>
 "We are pleased with the results and the progress that we have made in   
the third quarter," said Kenneth E. Olson, chairman and CEO of <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font>.   "While revenues early in the quarter were slow due to the unavailability of key components, we were able to solve the major component issues by the end of December.  Both the Desktop Projector 2810 and the DP5100 were shipped in record quantities."
<p>
 "The overall market for high-brightness desktop projectors continued to   
expand rapidly during the quarter," noted Olson.  "The market's response   
to our new line of  high-brightness Desktop Projectors has been   
exceptional as evidenced by record order rates and backlog levels."

<TITLE> Presentation Science - The Presentation Environment (Page 2) </TITLE>
</HEAD>

<BODY bgcolor="FFFFFF" vlink="AF0040" alink="04BC04">

<A HREF="univ_science.map"><IMG SRC="gifs/science_header.gif" width = 600 height = 114  ISMAP  border = none alt = "Presentation Science"></A>
<H2>The Presentation Environment</H2>
<table width = 598>
	<tr>

<B>Image size</B>
<p>
Image size is probably the single most important part of your presentation, next to content and delivery. Factors that affect image size include viewing distance from the image and a combination of the brightness of the projection system and ambient lighting (more on these topics later). An image too small to see means you lose people's attention.
<p>
Simple math defines the minimum recommended image size; all you need is the farthest distance (in feet) a person may be sitting or standing from the screen during your presentation. If the farthest participant is 20 feet away, your image size can be calculated by adapting the Viewing Distance Rule of Thumb:
<p>

<center>
</menu>
MVD (Max Viewing Distance)  =  8  x  Image Height &#160<B>or</B> &#160MVD / 8  =  Image Height
<br>
20' (farthest from screen)  /  8 (MVD multiplier) = 2.5' Image Height<br>
The minimum recommended image height at 20 feet is 2.5 feet. 
<p>
<menu>
<IMG SRC="gifs/science4.gif" width = 529 height = 119>
<p>
</center>

<table width = 549>
	<tr>
		<td valign = top><font size = +1>R</font>ULE&#160<font size = +1>O</font>F&#160<font size = +1>T</font>HUMB: </td>
		<td><B>IMAGE HEIGHT:</B>  MAX VIEWING DISTANCE / 8 = MINIMUM IMAGE HEIGHT.</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>
Now that you know the minimum recommended image height for the farthest viewing distance to the image, you can calculate how close the nearest person should sit. An image too large is overpowering and people lose sight of the overall picture (sort of like not being able to see the forest for the trees). In general though, it's better to have an image too large than too small.
<p>

<center>
2.5' (Image Height)  x  2 (Minimum Distance Multiplier)<br>=  Nearest viewer should be no closer than 5'
<p>
</center>

Therefore, an image 2.5' tall is best viewed from 5 to 20 feet.
<p>
<B>Calculating overall screen size</B>
<p>
The horizontal and diagonal dimensions of your image can be calculated from your image height. The normal dimensions of a projected image are 3 (height) x 4 (length) x 5 (diagonal). Therefore, the height is 3/4 the length and 3/5 of the diagonal size. If you know the height of the image (in this case 2.5 feet), the length and diagonal size of the image can be calculated as following:
<p>
<center>
<IMG SRC="gifs/science5.gif" width = 143 height = 115>
<p>
</center>
			<table width = 549>
				<tr>
					<td valign = top><font size = +1>R</font>ULE&#160<font size = +1>O</font>F&#160<font size = +1>T</font>HUMB: </td>
					<td valign = top><B>SCREEN&#160SIZE:</B></td>
					<td>NORMAL DIMENSIONS OF A PROJECTED IMAGE IS 3:4:5.<br>IMAGE HEIGHT X 1.33 = HORIZONTAL IMAGE LENGTH.<br>IMAGE HEIGHT X 1.67 = DIAGONAL IMAGE SIZE.</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
<p>
<B>What is the smallest graphic/character a person can see at any given distance?</B>
<p>
The characters and graphics in your presentation must be large enough for even the people in the last row to see clearly. A spreadsheet is probably the hardest type of image to display because of the size of the fonts that must be used (Note: consider using software like MindPath's FX to highlight or magnify areas under discussion for images of that type).
<p>
Determining minimum size for characters and images in your presentation is a relatively simple computation. Visual acuity (VA) is defined and measured in terms of the angular size of the smallest character that can be recognized. Normal VA is considered to be 1.0 when the smallest recognizable letter occupies an angular height of 5 minutes from the eye and each element of the letter occupies 1 minute of the 5. 
<p>
<center>
<IMG SRC="gifs/science6.gif" width = 376 height = 91>
<p>
</center>
Use the following simplified formula to determine the minimum size a graphic/character must be at any given distance (in feet) to be seen clearly by people with average eye sight. (We added "x 2" in the formula before it was reduced to ensure people with less than 20/20 vision can clearly see the smallest graphic/characters in your presentation.)
<p>

<center>
<B>H  &#160  =   &#160  .035  &#160   x  &#160   D</B>
<p>
</center>

<menu>
H  =  height of a projected graphic/character in inches<br>
D  =  distance from the projected image in feet
</menu>
<p>
The actual formula before it is reduced is:
<p>
<menu>
H  =  { [ tan( 5/60  x  &#188/180 ) ]  x  2}  x  12  x  D &#160 Where . . .
<p>
</menu>
tan( 5/60  x  &#188/180 )  =  5 minutes of vision converted from radians to degrees<br>
x  2  =  doubles the size of the minimum character size for improved legibility<br>
x  12  =  converts distance from the projected image in feet to inches
<p>
And . . .
<p>
<menu>
<B>*</B> &#160 5 / 60     =     0.08333<br>
<B>*</B> &#160 3.14159   /   180     =     0.01745<br>
<B>*</B> &#160 0.08333     x     0.01745   =    0.00145<br>
<B>*</B> &#160  tangent  of  0.00145     =     0.00145<br>
<B>*</B> &#160 0.00145     x     2      =     0.00290<br>
<B>*</B> &#160 0.00290     x     12     =     0.03490
</menu>
<p>
Therefore . . .
<p>
<menu>
H &#160=&#160     0.03490 &#160x&#160     D<br>
<B>&#160 &#160</B>=&#160 0.03490 &#160x&#160   20 feet &#160=&#160 0.69813 in. &#160</font>which rounds to<font size = +1>&#160 0.7 in.
</menu>
<p>
Height of the smallest character on the screen should be at least 0.7 inches at a distance of 20 feet.

<B>Projectors</B>
<p>
Projector, in this industry, describes a portable device that integrates an imaging device with a light source and projection optics. It is also a derivative of the term Desktop Projection<font size = "-1"><sup>TM</sup></font>, coined by <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> to describe this technology and the resulting <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> products. There are computer data only, video data only, and combined computer and video data projectors on the market today. Desktop projectors or "projectors" that fit in this category are defined as:
<p>
<UL>
<LI>An LCD or reflective imaging device.
<LI>Portable is less than 35 pounds and a handle.
<LI>The light source is either halogen- or metal halide-based (at this printing).
<LI>Projection optics direct and focus the light on or through the imaging device and onto the screen.
</UL>
<p>
Customer surveys and market research indicate the top criteria for purchasing this type of projector include brightness, ease-of-use, portability, and price. Projectors in this category provide image brightness anywhere from 100-500 ANSI lumens, are typically between 18 and 25 pounds, and are all below $10,000. Ease of use equates to on-screen menus, both a hand-held remote control and a keypad on the projector, and some type of simple graphical user interface (GUI).
<p>
<I>Brightness</I>
<p>
Projectors that provide less than 125 ANSI lumens are quickly becoming a product of the past. While there is some need for this type of product (educational and/or low budget applications), recent improvements and advances in projection technology have increased image brightness and lowered the price to the point of near elimination of this range of products. These products work best with the room lights completely off, and their performance compares to an overhead projector/projection panel combination. 
<p>
Projector offerings in the 125-250 ANSI lumen range are wide and varied; there are probably 50 different products available to choose from, with just as wide a range of specifications and features offered. These projectors perform best in rooms that are dimly lit, and the uniformity of image provided by the projector makes a great difference in how much light can be present in the room.
<p>
The 250-375 ANSI lumen projectors are quickly becoming the standard for brightness today. With the exception of a few "notebook projectors" currently in design by the leading projector manufacturers, most new projectors are designed to provide at least 300 ANSI lumens. Even at 300 ANSI lumens, image size is limited by the amount of ambient light in the room. Applying the "ANSI Lumens  &divide;  Screen Area" and   "3  x  (Ambient light / 2)" rules of thumb, a 300 ANSI lumen projector in a typical meeting room with all the lights on performs best with an image area under seven feet.
<p>
The top end of this category of projection device brightness is now 375-500 ANSI lumens. A 500 ANSI lumen projector in a fully-lit conference room can easily project a usable image of 11 square feet (nearly 3 x 4) or larger, depending on the proximity of overhead lights to the screen.
<p>
<I>Ease of Use</I>
<p>
Much of the "ease of use" buying criteria for projectors is subjective, and can be compared to the early differences between a Macintosh and a PC. What seems easy and natural to one person may not be to another. As such, ease of use in projectors refers primarily to hardware setup and the graphical user interface. The less a user has to interact with the projector, the more easy it is to use; when a user does interact with it, is it easy to figure out or does it require reading the instructions? 
<p>
"Intuitive" is the password for ease of use in the projection industry.
<p>
<I>Portability</I>
<p>
This characteristic is one of the most loosely-defined in the industry; portable often simply means there is a handle on the projector. When choosing a projector, consider how it will be used and who will be using it. Some issues to consider:
<p>
<UL>
<LI>Is the lens protected during shipping?
<LI>Is the projector well-balanced when picked up by the handle?
<LI>Does the shape of the projector make it easy to carry?
<LI>Is it light enough to be carried on a business trip (<25 lb.), or just from room to room (<35 lb.)?
<LI>Will the projector (in a soft carrying case) fit in the storage bin over an airplane seat?
<LI>Will others that use the projector consider it as portable as you?
</UL>
<p>
<I>Price</I>
<p>
Surprisingly, our research shows this is one of the lowest priorities items considered when purchasing a projector. This is probably due to the actual measure of price: Price/Performance. All projectors have some common hardware and performance characteristics/specifications to consider with price. They are:
<p>
<UL>
<LI>Brightness (ANSI lumens)
<LI>Size and weight
<LI>Optical (fixed or zoom lens, power or manual)
<LI>Computer compatibility (PC, Mac, resolution)
<LI>Video (multimedia) capability
<LI>Image quality (subjective)
<LI>Ease of use (subjective)
</UL>
<p>
If all these things are equal in your opinion between two projectors, then price becomes the deciding factor. Otherwise, weigh the value of each feature that is added or missing and then decide.
<p>
<B>Test your projection system before beginning your presentation.</B>
<p>
Now that you know how large your audience is, how far they are setting from the screen, how large an image you need, what the smallest character height on your image can be, how bright a projector you need for that size image or how low to turn the lights... set it up and test it!
<p>
Audience members don't want to wait while you fumble around with cables, screens and setup controls.

<B>Description/Objectives</B>
<p>
Business education teacher Lucie Podd has proposed to include a new "Electronic Publishing" course as part of the business education curriculum at North Country Union High School in Newport, Vermont.  The course will utilize and instruct students on the use of multimedia applications and equipment.  The student objectives are as follows:  
<p>
<menu>
-	Improve communication skills; <br>
-	Develop leadership skills;  <br>
-	Learn to use new technologies; <br>
-	Instruct staff from other disciplines about the power of using desktop projection units and multimedia to transform and enhance instruction; <br>
-	Introduce the local community to the effectiveness of combining desktop projection equipment with multimedia.
</menu>
<p>
<B>Implementation</B>
<p>
The course will be implemented through the business education department to second year students who have already learned to touch type, use Windows-based word processing, spreadsheets, databases, and telecommunication.
<p>
Stage 1:  Training.  Utilize the desktop projector to facilitate training students on the tools.
<p>
Stage 2: Teaming Up/Selecting Projects.  Each student will be responsible for creating three multimedia projects, while collaborating with members from different areas of the school or local community.  Projects must have a useful purpose as a completed work, and must introduce others to the power of multimedia in the communication process (written and oral).
<p>
<menu>
Project 1:  Create a web page representing one facet of the <A HREF="http://www.together.net/~vtbused/ncu.htm">educational community</A>;
<p>
Project 2:  Create a web page representing one facet of the <A HREF="http://cyberfair.gsn.org/ncuhs/intro.htm">local community</A>;
<p>
Project 3:  Assist one teacher in the creating of a multimedia presentation to enhance instruction.
</menu>
<p>
Stage 3:  Use the available technology, local resources, and teamwork to complete the projects.  Collaboration will insure consistency, and students will learn to recognize, appreciate and use each others' strengths for improved results.  Leadership skills will be developed as they collaborate with others outside the classroom.  Desktop projection equipment used to communicate their vision.
<p>
Stage 4:  Presentations to community groups (Rotary Club, etc.), academic departments, groups within the school, and elementary schools.  
<p>
Stage 5:  Measurement & Assessment.  A pre-and post-project assessment tool will be developed to measure the increase in students' technical and communication skills.  Success measurement will be through self-evaluation, peer evaluation and teacher evaluation. The impact on the school and community will be measured by the number of students, staff, and community members introduced to multimedia throughout the year.
<p>
<B>Technology Model</B>
<p>
The business education classroom lab includes 20 networked IBM-compatible computers, a laser and dot matrix printers, a flatbed color scanner, a still video capture tool, and QuickCam.  Five of the computer stations are connected to the Internet.  All computers have Microsoft Office and Internet Assistant loaded.  Some are equipped with Corel Draw and Hyperstudio.  The addition of Proxima's mobile media center will greatly enhance the model's capability.</font>

<font color = "CF0000"><B>The Electronic Arts Class</B></font>
<p>
</center>

Just four years ago, teacher Tim Comolli founded the "Imaging Lab" which, due to its success, has become the technology center of South Burlington High School in South Burlington, Vermont. The lab provides classes and services for students (particularly at-risk students), teachers and the townspeople. 
<p>
Today, the lab's growth has been greatly enhanced with the addition of an academic class called "Electronic Arts."  In a twist on the usual model of instruction, students are the primary teachers for the classes.  They instruct staff development courses, and teach parents in an evening course sponsored by the South Burlington Recreation Department. 
<p>
The lab has a professional graphics operation that offers instruction on all of the popular computer platforms, including Amiga, DOS, Mac and Silicon Graphics. Local business people even utilize the students for professional graphics work. 
<p>
With a desktop projection system, students and teachers will be able to exhibit materials and make presentations to the entire Electronic Arts class at once. And, with a projector as mobile as their ideas, they can successfully implement the final stage of their projects. They can take their class "on the road" to make presentations throughout the high school, as well as at local middle and elementary schools.</font>

In the past, teacher Knan Lee was only able to instruct six students at a time in video editing to produce WXEL News Live at the Phoenix Center School in Ocala, Florida. With a desktop projector, the entire class will be able to see the process and collectively make editing decisions.
<p>
The desktop projector will be integrated with a computer, two VCRs, video sketch titler and video camera to create a live broadcast news program. The projector will enable every student, regardless of individual learning style or learning disability, to participate in the writing and editing of the broadcast, and experience success.  In addition, the ability to project video images will command the attention and imagination of at-risk students to maintain interest and involvement.
<p>
When the actual broadcast takes place, the desktop projector will be used in concert with the computer and VCRs to project background images, weather maps and video tapes behind student anchors. The level of professionalism of the news broadcast will be a source of pride and accomplishment that will positively impact students.  Students will also develop a sense of partnership and ownership in the final news production.</font>

<font color = "CF0000"><B>Projecting Multimedia for Group Exploration of Local Information</B></font>
<p>
</center>

The objective of our proposal is to provide our foreign adult students with
the opportunity to expand their English language skills through an approach
that combines speech, pictures and text in a unique format.  This format will
allow students to learn English through the exploration of local information.
To put it simply, we would like to combine a multimedia projection system
with the latest speech recognition software and digitized video to let a class of students "tour" their new surroundings, learn vocabulary and advance through the software by voice input.
<p>
With students from Europe, Africa, Asia and South America -- all at different
skill levels -- it is not always easy to provide a classroom experience that
encourages conversation or allows people to get the information or the practice they need.
<p>
Students would work together as a group, orally, to identify objects, actions
and words in a way that gives them immediate feedback and defines progress
that can be put to use in the community. Texts cannot always portray action;
they become outdated with respect to product prices and seldom have direct relevance to day to day life. Our program could provide ongoing focus, catch things as they're happening in the area and reflect current interests of class members. 
<p>
Some information, of course, would be static -- getting a library card,
reading a menu or enrolling your child in school -- but it could be specific to the community and a model that could be replicated meaningfully in other places.
<p>
Students would have to pronounce things well enough to be understood by the
speech recognition software. Their voices would provide input like "buttons"
used with a mouse in conventional multimedia programming. This would necessitate practice or group effort to select the correct words and pronounce them properly. Students could use the programs individually or
progress through the safety of a group -- letting beginners improve their
receptive skills in a setting that wouldn't depend on translation by others.
<p>
This program would be combined with an analysis of each person's pronunciation capabilities to provide a database of words a person could speak easily. Some of the voice "buttons" could be triggered by a number of
synonyms, allowing a system that will give students the confidence to
establish connections they need to interact comfortably and be productive.
<p>
Students are initially interviewed and assessed when they enter the program.
Students are identified as beginner, intermediate or advanced.
<p>
The Test of Adult Basic Education is used for evaluation of progress. We have
some CD-ROM and computer-aided instruction but nothing that we can use in a
group setting or that encourages practice pronouncing words. A good projection system linked to relevant information that requires speech would
be an enormous asset to our program.
<p>
Bangor High School has a multimedia lab that we can use during off-hours that has the video and multimedia software we would need to digitize information for the program.
<p>
System requirements would include:
<menu>
- &#160A computer with a least 8 megabytes of RAM and a sound card<br>
- &#160Kurzweil or Dragon Systems voice recognition software<br>
- &#160A Proxima Desktop Projector<br>
- &#160Macromedia Director, Adobe Photoshop (we have access to), Avid Videoshop or Adobe Premiere video editing (we have), Microsoft Works database (we have)
</menu>
<p>
We are working on another grant to get the voice recognition system and are
currently designing the database that diagnoses pronunciation skills. Students will contribute to the development of the program by assisting in the selection and videotaping of places, things and activities. They will also assist in the data input for the pronunciation skills database.
<p>
The Learning Center will make this model available to any school or organization, such as Literacy Volunteers, that would like to use it or draw
from it in the design of their own program. We will inform people about the
program at the Learning Center, through press releases and public service announcements, and on the home page of the Bangor Area Information Resources Network.</font>

<font color = "CF0000"><B>Teaching Drafting Through Projection</B></font>
<p>
</center>

There are many difficulties that an instructor must face in an inter-city
school system. I intend to use a combination of technologies based around a
Proxima display device to overcome a few of these.
<p>
One of the problems that I have when I demonstrate a manual drafting skill
to my 25 beginning students is that they cannot see all the detailed methods used in the drawing. I plan to use a two-camera video system mounted to a drafting table and projected on a large 12-foot by 12-foot screen to overcome this problem. This will allow our students to view -- via the large screen -- the details, hand positions, pencil positions, and proper methods needed to do their drawings correctly. Multiple camera placement is critical for the students to be able to see what is being done. Even with a small group of students, it is difficult to see because the drafter's hands block the view of what is being done. With multiple viewing angles students will be able to view what is being done anywhere in my 2,000-square-foot room.
<p>
To view the actual drawing is only the first step in the process. The system I envision will not be a simple projection system. My students also need visual notes. These notes will be displayed on a computer and switched to the large screen as each point is demonstrated.
<p>
New notes will be added each time a new step is completed and displayed on
the screen. The output from the camera and computer will be fed to a videotape unit. This videotape will allow students to later review the drawing process independently at their desks, on their own screens, at their own pace, and pause to complete a drawing step if needed.
<p>
I plan to use these videos as a tool to help my students that have attendance problems, as well. Currently, there is not enough time to review missed assignments, start new assignments and help students with individual problems. By using a combination of large-screen projection, video review,
missed assignment review and note skill development, I hope to improve the
overall success rate of my students.
<p>
The last area that I hope to improve upon is the speed at which my students
do their assignments. I plan to do paced assignments on the large screen at
the beginning of each hour. These assignments will not contain new information or techniques. The main focus will be on quality and speed. The
students must follow along at their own boards, drawing the same drawing
that I am, at the same time and just as quickly. Using this technique, I hope to increase the number and quality of their drawings, and improve their drawing speed and drafting technique.
<p>
<B>Project Evaluation</B>
<br>
Once this system has been in place for a semester, I will review the grades and quantity of work they have completed. I will look closely at the students that have learning disabilities and attendance problems to see if they have, as a group, improved. I will compare this to the previous semesters that I have taught using low tech or no tech tools.  The results of these comparisons will determine how effective the system is.
<p>
<B>Technology Equipment Model</B>
<br>
To implement this project I intend to interconnect two video cameras, a PC-based computer with a word processor program, and a large-screen projection system -- all connected to a video recording system. The students will also have several video playback systems available to view prerecorded demonstrations.</font>

<font color = "CF0000"><B>Projecting Tomorrow's Classroom + The Virtual Field Trip</B></font>
<p>
</center>

In a time of shrinking budgets, many schools find themselves compelled to
cut field trips from school programs. This practice leaves students with
little or no idea of the world outside their communities. The Virtual Field
Trip's educational objective is to provide learners with the experience of
visiting interesting sites in a cost-efficient, yet unique fashion. In addition, it presents a model for classroom interaction that is useful across the curriculum.
<p>
Recent technological innovations, most notably the introduction of QuickTime VR (Apple Computers), have made the Virtual Field Trip possible. In addition, the ever-increasing number of QuickTime VR movies available via the Internet provide a wide range of field trip destinations. Finally, the cost of creating QuickTime VR movies is within the budget capabilities of most school sites.
<p>
In its simplest form, implementing the Virtual Field Trip requires only a
computer with the appropriate QuickTime VR software, an overhead projector
and LCD panel, and the QuickTime VR movie for the desired destination. With
this simple setup, teachers can take their class to Yosemite Valley, the San Francisco Golden Gate Bridge, Mt. Everest Base Camp or one of the many other movie destinations available. The ability to move forward and backward in QuickTime VR movies ensures that teachers would be able to point out specific items of interest in the scene as well as enhance the feeling of "being there."
<p>
The second level of the Virtual Field Trip requires a bit more equipment but still remains easily within the means of most schools. In this setup, a video camera is added to the original setup as well as a genlock, or a video editing board, with chromakey capability. With this equipment, teachers are able to "genlock" themselves or a group of students into the projected display, as is done with the weatherperson and weather map on television.
<p>
This setup requires that an area be set up in the classroom with a single color backdrop, usually blue, where the people who are to be put into the scene may stand. The video camera takes their picture and feeds it into the genlock or video editor which blends them into the QuickTime VR scene output by the first computer. Finally, this blended image is sent to the LCD panel for projection.
<p>
Setting up this equipment is not as daunting as it sounds. Many schools are
already utilizing genlocks or chromakeying in their video production classes. The Virtual Field Trip simply takes this proven technology to add an extra element of realism by integrating the images of the participants with the QuickTime VR movies. This is a powerful technique which allows students to serve as virtual tour guides of such educational sites as the Lincoln Memorial without ever leaving the classroom.
<p>
The third stage of the Virtual Field Trip would be for a school to purchase the digital camera and software necessary to author their own QuickTime VR movies. This additional investment would allow teachers to visit interesting sites and create field trip destinations for use back in their classrooms. In addition, students could create their own field trip destination for use in their classroom.
<p>
Regardless of which technology model is used in the classroom, the key element to the success of the Virtual Field Trip is a high quality projection panel or data projector. Fortunately, the cost of these LCD panels and projectors have dropped to the point that they are now affordable for classroom use. This affordability factor coupled with the free nature of the QuickTime VR software and movies means that the Virtual Field Trip can become a reality in almost any classroom.</font>

<p>
</center>

I propose to use the Proxima Desktop Projector 2750 to enhance the unit on
mitosis. The objectives for my Applied Biology classes would be to describe
all five phases of mitosis and the duplication of chromosomes.
<p>
The Proxima Desktop Projector 2750 would be used to display the computer
program on cell division. The projector would allow the students to see the
duplication of chromosomes and the whole mitosis process at the same time.
This would facilitate class discussion and explanation as the students view
the program together. The time lapse photomicrography would enable the
students to actually see the process. Without the use of this multimedia
program the students would be limited to still pictures of the process.
<p>
The class will make models of the process on the computer using the paint
brush program. In groups, the students will create transparencies of the
process and give a description of the process to the class.
<p>
The students would be evaluated in two ways. First, the students will give a
written and pictorial description of the mitosis process. Second, the
students will use the projector to explain the process to the class, as it
occurs on the projection screen. Both of these objectives will be done with
85 percent accuracy.</font>

<p>
</center>

Tomorrow's classroom will provide students with innovative ways to envision
their futures as they explore various technological pathways to enhance their communicative skills and global learning. In the communications or journalism class, for example, students could utilize the Internet to update
commentary to support their lead news story, synthesizing articles which may be incorporated into the weekly school newspaper layout. Then, projecting the tabloid page on the large screen utilizing the Proxima DP5100 Desktop Projector, the staff may critique the entire page. They could view readable print and artwork that heretofore remained an impossibility -- rendering the standard overhead projector obsolete. The instructor would thus effortlessly capture students' attention, capitalizing on the teachable moment to review layouts and to conduct on-screen editing. This would invite students to engage in the thinking/revising process and demonstrate "live lessons" created with the whole class actively participating.
<p>
With clarity, precision, and movability, the Mobile Media Center -- featuring
the desktop projector and the multimedia Pentium laptop computer mounted on the media cart -- may be rolled from classroom to classroom to demonstrate multimedia presentations that students have created, such as a two-minute spot recorded by a camcorder fed through the laptop and projected to the whole class. Students may select from varied projects, including taping "on-the-street" interviews which may be shared during class discussion or capturing still images with a digital camera to illustrate a research report presented through the use of the overhead.
<p>
<B>Educational Objectives</B>
<br>
* Students in photography and film production classes will utilize existing
cameras and editing equipment to produce short campus news clips and information videos averaging two to five minutes. These will be incorporated into scripts prepared by journalism students utilizing desktop publishing and overhead projection. Once a week, students will broadcast news clips about live-action sports, club activities, special events and special projects as they wheel the Mobile Media Center into homerooms for school news and announcements.
<p>
* In journalism and communications classes, students will complete one
multimedia group research project per semester. They will focus on a current event and use available resources in the technology lab (word processing and on-line research), keeping in mind that their final projects (which may utilize sound bites and video) will be presented on a large screen to the whole class.
<p>
* In day-to-day classroom instruction, the teacher may provide directed
learning as needed by demonstrating on-line searches and conducting whole-class activities while navigating the Internet. Thus, the Mobile Media Center becomes not only a tool, but an entire new way of envisioning learning. It will explore our reality as it immediately unfolds, from "live-editing" to on-the-spot recording. It will transmit instantaneous classroom information, and revitalize and transform knowledge and instruction.
<p>
<B>Implementation Plan</B>
<br>
The Mobile Media Center technology will be easily integrated into existing
journalism, photography and video filming classes to enhance learning and
facilitate communication throughout the entire campus.</font>

<font color = "CF0000"><B>Using Internet Sites in Teaching World Geography</B></font>
<p>
</center>

We propose to revise the present grade six geography course to use Internet
sites and multimedia production as the main learning tools. Perhaps more than any other subject, social studies can directly use the Internet as a teaching and learning tool. On the second page to this entry is a very partial list of sites which contain information about geography and culture.
<p>
Mr. Bicher and Mr. Krall will co-teach grade six students in the social studies course, "World Cultures/World Geography." Mr. Krall's classroom will have only chairs and computers. He will guide the students in creating multimedia productions using the presently-owned Macintosh computers - three 5200LC/75s, one LCIII, one LCII, and one 475. These computers will be situated in six semi-private pods with a multimedia program and learning objective at each. Children will work in cooperative learning groups of four to six students each. Each pod will have Internet access and Flash-it software, along with either ClarisWorks Slide Show, HyperStudio or Digital Chisel. One pod will have the option of Amazing Animation, a simpler multimedia production program. A scanner will be available in the lab next to the classroom. All hardware and software is already owned by the school or participating teachers. Video capture capabilities will be provided, if needed.
<p>
The large group projection capabilities will be used in Mr. Bicher's classroom. Mr. Bicher will use bookmarked Internet sites to introduce regions and countries, to supplement student presentations, and to summarize information. A combination of country home pages, travel directories, educational sites, and home pages of cities, businesses and individuals which offer graphics and/or information will create a well-rounded presentation. The presentations will remain dynamic and current as sites are added and updated.
<p>
Mr. Krall and Mr. Bicher will be given schedules which coincide, so that 58
children and two teachers can combine and exchange classes at will. Student
presentations will be made to combined classes as often as possible to
increase their value and to allow students to learn from one another.
<p>
Multimedia projects will be evaluated on content as well as the meeting of
objectives. Projects will also be followed by a self-evaluation and a
written summary. Standard tests will be given following whole group
presentations. It is believed that the skills, understanding and measurable
knowledge will equal or exceed that of a traditional class. Student
involvement will greatly improve.
<p>
<B>Benefits:</B>
<br>
1. This information is constantly updated, often multimedia, and free. A number of sites will add information or graphics when requested to do so. An aggressive teacher can actually create a geography resource which will far outweigh any textbook and rival most school information centers.
<p>
2. Outstanding projects by students can become part of the instructional milieu. As student skills progress, multimedia programs can be used to access Internet sites, allowing sites to become part of the multimedia report.
<p>
3. The six pods will be used constantly, as will be the projection system.
Without the co-teaching, each type of technology would rest while the other
was being used.
<p>
4. Mr. Krall, as part-time Learning and Technology Coordinator, will have
more freedom to attend to his duties. While he will remain a social studies
teacher, his educational direction will be technology. This project will
also be an excellent example of the marriage of learning and technology.

<p>
</center>

<B>Objective:</B>
<br>
To use technology to provide an active cross-curricular learning
environment where students experience using technology as a tool.
<p>
<B>Proposal:</B>
<br>
I propose that a Proxima DP5100 Desktop Projector can meet the
needs of an entire classroom of students in a non-lab setting. While many
schools are still developing technology plans, computer labs are either
non-existent or they are reserved for basic applications and business
courses (word processing, keyboarding, etc.). I propose that the projector
is the future of classroom technology in that it can allow an entire class
to participate in a single task or project simultaneously.
<p>
<B>Technology model:</B>
<br>
The fifth and sixth grade music students currently use a multimedia production workstation. This workstation, based on the Macintosh Power PC 5300/100 CD/V, allows for digital video production, digital audio recording, music sequencing, music publishing, presentation authoring, individual/classroom tutoring, and CD-ROM-based instruction.
<p>
The workstation is mobile to accommodate moving between classrooms. (No
music room is currently available.) The addition of a desktop projector such as the Proxima DP5100  as a presentation and learning tool would greatly enhance the students' music learning experience because one computer monitor limits the workstation's effectiveness.
<p>
<B>Classroom Music:</B>
<br>
The fifth and sixth grade music students currently work on a number of projects that incorporate music and other disciplines. Following is just one example of these projects that demonstrate how the Proxima DP5100 Desktop Projector might be used.
<p>
<B>Project:</B>
<br>
Amazon Adventure--Sights and Sounds of the Tropical Rain Forest.
This project is part of a cross-curricular experience with the science
class unit on the rain forest.
<p>
<B>Time line:</B>
<br>
Two weeks (four 30-minute music classes).
<p>
<B>Materials:</B>
<br>
Orff instruments, synthesizer, individual music parts (in the
form of a tone poem--a story without words), presentation authoring
software, Tropical Rain Forest Reference CD-ROM, multimedia workstation,
Proxima DP5100 Desktop Projector.
<p>
<B>Rehearsal:</B>
<br>
In order to minimize the amount of equipment transported to each
classroom music session, the individual music parts are projected onto the
screen for the students to read, rather than using music stands.
Rather than using individual music flash cards or huddling 25 students
around a single monitor, music images are projected onto a single screen,
giving the instructor the instant ability to pace the class effectively. As
students become more proficient in their rehearsals, they are able to
memorize their music parts. The students now break into teams, each with
its own set of responsibilities, to create a presentation containing images
of the tropical rain forest directly correlating with the music examples.
An audio recording is made of the rehearsal, and the presentation is
authored with images from a rain forest reference CD-ROM that represents
the individual instrument groups (the rain stick represents rain, the
afuche represents insect sounds, etc.). The dress rehearsal synchronizes
the students' music performance with the presentation.
<p>
<B>Performance:</B>
<br>
The students perform Amazon Adventure as the finale of the
Spring Student Talent Show. Rather than presenting the project to the
entire student body, faculty, and parents on a single computer monitor or
television monitor, the presentation is projected on a screen for all to
appreciate.
<p>
<B>Student Evaluation:</B>
<br>
Evaluation is centered on three elements: student
performance, student knowledge, and student performance as part of a team.
Traditional and contemporary methods are used. Worksheets, class
discussions and quizzes assess individual knowledge. Playing tests on
instruments and student portfolios evaluate student performance as an
individual and as part of a team.
<p>
<B>System Effectiveness:</B>
<br>
The effectiveness of the system will be measured by several indicators.
* Student involvement in the subject matter: Is their participation more or
less active? Students who are more actively involved in content will
benefit more and are more likely to retain knowledge.
* Efficiency of presentation: Is the subject matter presented more
efficiently? Is more time used on instruction? Is content covered more
in-depth and is more subject matter covered?
* Student evaluation: Do students possess stronger understanding of subject
matter? Have class objectives been reached?</font>

<p>
</center>

Kentucky schools have undergone a tremendous change in the last five years.
We, as a state, have endeavored to provide an environment that is real world and holistic. No longer can we as educators look at our content as an isolated entity or individual skills. We must, in fact, broaden our concept of how our content fits into the student's life and his/her view of the future. Kentucky's educators are dedicated to this concept. We have restructured our whole education program by implementing KERA (Kentucky Education Reform Act).
<p>
One of the cornerstones of KERA is the infusion of technology into the curriculum. Technology, ideally, will be a part of everyday teaching as paper and pencil is at present. When I was a science teacher, it was important to have a group of students on the computer everyday. I am so dedicated to the concept of infusion, I have participated for three years as a PRISM (Promoting Reform In Science and Math) technology specialist and Instructional Technology Leaders. During my time with these organizations, I began to realize that the real value in technology lies with its ability to motivate and enthuse.
<p>
For instance, I can see a science teacher teaching a unit on weather. Students would track weather and make a climatic or daily chart for this area's weather. Students would initially do all work on construction paper, then plan what they would say as a weather forecaster. Finally, work would be done on a slide show package, such as Power Point. The student would then present their data using scientific terms and appropriate graphics. I see the potential in all areas. Social studies could do a news reel of the time being studied importing video and drawing graphics. Language arts could do a slide show play or defend a position. The uses are endless.
<p>
All of this would be more meaningful if projected on a screen. Students could be reassigned different areas of content to tell a different aspect, but learn and be responsible for all areas presented. Students would have a vested interest and would be more likely to take care and be more exact if peers, teachers, and parents were shown. It gives students ownership and allows for pride in the work done.
<p>
I also see how important it will be for professional development purposes in our school. It will allow material presented to our teachers to be presented in a motivating way and show them that technology can be used easily and effectively with anyone. I see teachers participating in their own professional development by taking on a segment of the learning (just as our students did) and use Power Point and the Proxima projector to present material. This encourages them to deal with new classroom techniques as well as becoming more comfortable with technology integration.
<p>
As a counselor I see technology as a way to promote communication. One way
I see using Proxima and the technology associated with it is to encourage
students in a group guidance situation to express themselves in a presentation form. They could explain who they see themselves as or explain
a difficult situation. Proxima would turn the eyes away from them and allow
them to talk freely. My students need to learn to view themselves as positive, valuable human beings. I strongly believe that technology frees many minds as it organizes a cluttered environment, meaning the middle school students. I envision students producing presentations on drug education, sexual harassment, self-esteem and many others. They will become peer tutors and everyone will have a turn.
<p>
All students should be involved in the well-being of their school. Proxima will be the key to many of their successes. I will initially target 60 students: 25 sixth graders, 25 seventh graders, and 10 eighth graders. These students, for the most part, will be at-risk students (grades and/or discipline). There will be a group session with me once a month to promote self-esteem. During these sessions, these students will be assigned the counseling theme of the
month. This will mean they will come up with activities and presentations
to use on their teams for the whole student body. I will view it and guide them to its appropriateness. In addition, these students would have priority status for use of this technology in the classroom and be allowed to use it in their regular classrooms. I am hopeful this will aid in their motivation and success in the classroom.
<p>
Assessment for the Proxima grant will be:
<menu>
* &#160The students' presentations and activities<br>
* &#160The students' success in the classroom.<br>
* &#160The students' discipline notification.<br>
* &#160A survey of their teachers.<br>
* &#160A survey of the students involved as well as a random survey of the
regular population.<br>
* &#160A written report from persons implementing this program.<br>
</menu>
<p>
All students will be involved in the use of technology to promote learning and self-esteem, but for assessment purposes I will target certain students in my population.
<p>
I am truly excited about Proxima and its uses in the school environment. School should never be boring. It should be dynamic and full of life. I feel strongly that technology aids in that goal. If our school achieves this goal, then learning will occur. Learning at that point cannot be stopped.</font>

<font color = "CF0000"><B>Improving Communication and Problem Solving Skills</B></font>
<p>
</center>

The objective of my "Win with Proxima" plan is to improve the communication
and problem solving skills of fifth and sixth grade language arts students. I will use a digital camera, computer and Proxima projector to improve writing skills, to create a class journal for historical and demonstration purposes, and to motivate students to communicate more effectively. Photographs of students, sites and situations will be displayed via our Proxima Desktop Projector. They can be cropped, enhanced or even shown in cartoon form. Student responses to the photographs will be typed in, revised and group edited. Pictures can be shown to an entire class, and text will be seen almost as soon as it is spoken. No more waiting for responses to be written on the chalkboard! It will create writing prompts which will motivate visual, oral and written communication. Each day's journal entry can be stored for further revision after students have had time for reflection. It will eventually be printed and bound into book form with our spiral binding machine for placement in our school media center. The combination of digital camera and Proxima media center will create a positive learning environment.
<p>
The effectiveness of the program will be assessed by teacher-directed writing samples using a teacher-made rubric to measure: (1) responding to a
writing prompt, (2) using a variety of descriptive language, (3) using standard grammar, mechanics and spelling, and (4) expressing individual ideas. A pretest and posttest will be given. It will also be evaluated by a student opinion survey and by the final product of the class journal.</font>

As Milton Glick pointed out in his article in EduCom Review, "Everything we
are used to -- books, lectures, television -- is one-way, focused on what the teacher, writer or actor does. It is hard for us to remember that it is not what the teacher does but what he or she gets students to do that results in learning." (Glick, 1990)
<p>
For this reason, "interactive computing ... a new teaching medium, combining visual values of television and instructional ideas," (Hale, 1989) needs to take its place in the classroom. This proposal accepts Hale's challenge and will attempt to provide classroom instruction in English/Language Arts which promotes collaborative teaching-learning through technology.
<p>
<B>Educational Objective</B>
<br>
The objective of this proposal is to successfully involve students with
curricular material in an active, rather than passive mode. Using desktop
projectors, computer applications and audio/video sources, students will
manipulate and apply their knowledge through reading, writing and speaking
activities.
<p>
<B>Impact on Learning</B>
<br>
Students will be able to:
<menu>
* Read and discuss on-screen examples of selected literature.<br>
* Search out and experience a Web site about an author or identified literary theme.<br>
* Research, collect and organize on- or off-line material for presentation
to the class.<br>
* Reach out, through Internet connection, to other students or adults for
research and/or presentation of project ideas. Project assignments will be
shared with others on the school's Web home page.<br>
* Practice reading, composition and speaking skills as literary themes and
related projects are developed.<br>
* Work together or individually, as needed, with teacher input to develop
inquiry, critical thinking and problem-solving strategies.
</menu>
<p>
<B>Evaluation of Effectiveness</B>
<br>
Several evaluation techniques will be used to assess the effectiveness of the "interactive technology" approach. Student assessment portfolios on disk or video tape of unit projects and themes will allow teachers and parents to review the results of appropriate skill applications related to reading, writing and speaking. Peer review will be incorporated into the unit's assessment model. Students share their information with others in the class who may be working on a related aspect of the unit and eventually bring together all phases of the study in a large group setting. Evaluation and assessment is an ongoing process which will adjust as teacher and student find new ways of interacting with the technology.

a) To provide real-world learning experiences by connecting students to their community, and b) to allow students to contribute to their community through research and collaboration via ongoing presentations in the school as well as in the community.
<p>
School Background and Implementation Support: Minter Bridge operates within
a framework called the "School- Wide Enrichment Model" (SEM) which successfully demonstrates that students learn best when engaged in enriching and "real-world" activities. A full-time School-Wide Enrichment Specialist works with all students and staff to facilitate just these kinds of experiences, working in small groups and whole classes, K-6. At Minter Bridge, the SEM Specialist is also the Technology Facilitator who provides
leadership, training, and instruction in current and creative uses of technology. This position is unique due to its flexibility and ideal for facilitating this school-wide project. This project is consistent with the kinds of experiences enthusiastically supported by both staff and administration.
<p>
<B>General Project Description:</B>
<br>
The future will require many different kinds of abilities that responsible
educators must begin to integrate. Three important abilities that are difficult to learn and practice within the confines of a school setting include collaborating with the community, being aware of and involved in local issues, and truly contributing formally to that community through research, study and oral presentations.
<p>
The idea of this project is to take issues of genuine community and student
concern, collaborate with local organizations, develop target areas for student contribution, develop research processes using multiple technologies (such as the Internet, CD-ROM, PDAs) and then present the findings to the community using presentation tools! Multiple groups of students would be working both on conducting research and presenting to the impacted community members, as well as practicing their presentations in school to their peers. Student Research Teams and their "Multi-Media Electronic Newsletters" would become important contributors to the city, showcasing what students are capable of, as well as the impact of meaningful technology on student learning and motivation.
<p>
Imagine a fifth/sixth grade student group collaborating with the local fire
department, who has asked for data on families' safety plans. Students then
use the World Wide Web (present in our school) to collect data via telephone/fax/Internet forms and personal contacts. Students summarize their findings and present them to various groups including the fire department, chamber of commerce, a community safety board, and the mayor. As a result, a plan is implemented by the fire department to better educate families about the importance of safety plans!
<p>
Word circulates about the value of asking students for help. The Parks and
Recreation Department asks a third/fourth grade student group to collect
data on how families use parks to help in the development of a new community park. Students present to multiple community groups and share
findings that impact the plan and save the park department money, as well
as serve the children of their community.
<p>
An architecture firm wants research done on local housing styles to contribute to a national study on historic preservation. Students create a
multimedia presentation highlighting local styles along with examples.
<p>
When kids are empowered, their concerns become motivation for further study
and presentations -- from bat preservation to baseball fields, from rainfall to rain forests. Consider for just a moment the potential for student growth. The result of important work is impressive learning! 
<p>
Young students need genuine work. They want to learn about things they can
connect to -- that impact them. The skills and abilities that would result
from this kind of learning are obvious and exciting. Aside from the basic skills we teach such as reading and writing, we will develop students who
can set goals and reach them, meet deadlines, and follow a project to its
conclusion. Students understand the value of research and thinking, summarizing findings, making decisions, and working on a team.
<p>
Most important, we have empowered students to stand up and speak to an
audience about topics they care about, confidently and convincingly -- one of industry's highest rated skills.
<p>
The evaluation piece of this project is in its real-work scenarios. If students' research is incomplete or conclusions are misguided, their partners in the community will be on-hand to point out errors or misunderstandings. Students will care about the quality of their work since it must be shared with people who need accurate conclusions. In addition, evaluation of all special projects is conducted through an ongoing and thorough Collaborative Action Research process, supervised by the schools' Site Council and district administration.
<p>
Minter Bridge employs the technologies mentioned in the above plan, except
for the projection device and laptop. We use a variety of applications with
students including ClarisWorks, HyperCard, HyperStudio and PowerPoint; and
use Netscape and various smaller programs for work on the Web. A Technology
Team convenes regularly to determine the best practices and to upgrade our
equipment. All students have supervised access to the Internet, and can work on both Apple/Mac and PC platforms.
<p>
Minter Bridge also maintains an extensive community home page.
<p>
More than ever, educators and students have to push themselves to become
real leaders in a changing world if we are to be active participants instead of passive recipients and indifferent observers. The Proxima presentation tool would empower our students to become genuine contributors.</font>

<br>
* Project teacher instruction and lectures visually for not only the hearing impaired students, but all students in the class to increase comprehension and understanding of teacher language and instructions.<br>
* With the use of a laptop, type and project spoken information during school assemblies and all-school events that can often times be limiting to deaf students.<br>
* Allow large groups of students to work as a team to create multimedia presentations from curriculum content using authoring software such as Hyperstudio, Kid Pix Studio and HyperCard, and hardware such as scanners,
video cameras and digital photography.<br>
* Develop personal portfolios to include work accomplished, grades, interests, hobbies and other student information. Utilize many technologies
to input student work: scanning equipment, digital cameras and video clips.<br>
* Through use of such technologies, gain basic knowledge of the parts,
function and use of computer technology.<br>
* Give inservice instruction to teachers who work with deaf children to
educate them on deafness and modifications that can be beneficial to deaf
students, and to demonstrate the power of multimedia and the impact of
visual information in material retention.<br>
* Assist teachers in the use of new computer equipment, including
projection equipment, through demonstration, inservice, team teaching and
hands-on use.<br>
* Hold Saturday Tech Academy for Parents two to four times a year to share
programs and projects with parents, and to help them experience producing a
product of their own.<br>
* Use student-made presentations, Interactive Student Portfolios and
inservice materials to make presentations to community-based organizations
to share how education is welcoming and utilizing advanced technologies.
<p>
<B>Evaluation</B>
<br>
* Administer a questionnaire prior to implementation to participants.
Questions will pertain to knowledge and attitude toward technology. Student
will discuss attitudes about school and learning; teachers will discuss
attitudes and use of current technology. At the end of period, administer
the same questionnaire to examine attitudinal changes and changes in
teacher use of various equipment.<br>
* Compile and evaluate students' electronic portfolios, and use for
presentations to parents and community organizations.<br>
* Survey parents on their current level of computer competency at the start
of program. Later, request feedback on the effectiveness of the program.
<p>
Phase I of Access was a proposal that included purchase of specific
computer hardware. This proposal went into effect in April 1996. The school
was able to purchase a multimedia computer, scanner, digital camera and
color printer. The students have been learning terms, and basic functions
of the Macintosh, and how to create documents. Phase II is this Proxima
Proposal, and would help to expand the number of students and teachers who
could benefit and interact with already purchased equipment, and further
the purpose of Access for students and their needs.</font>

<p>
</center>

<B>Educational Objectives</B>
<br>
Students in Industrial Technology (IT) need
exposure to professionals and experts from the working world. In addition,
these students need integrated activities that contain applied and "real
world" applications.
<p>
<B>Technology Model:</B>
<br>
A mobile media center will allow teachers to bring into the classroom experts and professionals from all over the world and
throughout history. Also by using this technology, students can apply their
academic training to "real world" problems and situations.
<p>
<B>Sample Lesson Plan:</B>
<br>
Title: Advertising Poster<br>
Concepts Covered: One and two point perspectives, design, writing and
advertising.<br>
IT Academy Courses: Tech Core, Tech Math, Tech English<br>
Time Requirement: 10 class sessions<br>
Grade Level: Ninth and 10th grades<br>
Number of students involved: 250
<p>
<B>General Description of Project:</B>
<br>
Students will create an advertising poster
for a science fiction or fantasy movie with an attached short story.
<p>
<B>Justification of Lesson:</B>
<br>
This is an interdisciplinary lesson that
integrates geometry, design, fine art, literature, advertising and
illustration.
<p>
Use of Mobile Media Center: Students will take a tour of all the great
museums of the world. They will see the development and application of one
and two point perspectives from ancient times through the Renaissance,
Baroque and up through the present with a look at movie special effects.
The greatest artists and illustrators throughout the world and history will
teach the IT Academy students via projected laser disc images.
<p>
<B>Step by Step Description of Lesson:</B>
<br>
Students will:<br>
1. Learn the mechanics of one and two point perspectives with emphasis on
buildings and city landscapes.<br>
2. Study historic examples of perspective from the laser disc library
(daily for 10-15 minutes).<br>
3. Discuss the historical and philosophical significance of perspective in
different time periods and cultures.<br>
4. Draw a city landscape in perspective incorporating buildings, signs,
streets, vehicles, plants, etc., using pencil on an 8 1/2 by 11 inch white
paper (rough draft, which is approved by the teacher).<br>
5. Redraw and improve the rough draft and color with colored pencils or
crayons on 8 1/2 by 11 inch paper (color study, which is approved by
teacher).<br>
6. Make an advertising poster based on the color study for a science
fiction or fantasy movie. Quality examples will be projected on the board
for further study.<br>
7. Draft a two-page short story which uses the landscape of the poster as
the setting (rough draft)<br>
8. Give story rough draft to another student to critique.<br>
9. Rewrite short story (finished draft). Quality examples will be projected
on the board for all students to read.<br>
<p>
<B>Evaluation of Lesson:</B>
<br>
Students will turn in a packet containing five documents: rough draft
drawing, color study, poster, rough draft story and finished draft story.<br>
* 4 - Packet complete, well-executed, story understandable.<br>
* 3 - Packet complete, minor problems with poster and/or story.<br>
* 2a - Packet complete, major problems with execution of perspective,
sloppy presentation, major problems with story.<br>
* 2b - Packet incomplete, missing one of the drafts or color study.<br>
* 1 - Packet incomplete, missing two drafts or color study.<br>
* 0 - Packet incomplete, missing three or more items.
<p>
<B>Implementation Plan:</B>
<br>
A battery of lesson plans have already been developed which would utilize a media center and projection system. Once a system has been acquired it would see use in the classroom immediately.</font>

<p>
</center>

I teach special education at Shippensburg Area Junior High School in
Shippensburg, Pennsylvania. My students are enrolled in seventh, eighth and
ninth grades. In our school district, we are beginning to include special
education students in many regular education classes. That means all
teachers must learn to teach these special students as well as students who
learn more rapidly and who can work with less guidance.
<p>
More so than other students, special education students learn aurally -- by
seeing and hearing. Seeing visuals on a Proxima desktop projector will
enable these students to keep up with the other students in the "included"
classes. A lesson prepared for special education students can then be used
in each of the classes in which such students are included. Also, having
the lesson visuals in a computer will enable any teacher to replay the
lesson visuals for the special students in his or her classes.
<p>
One can predict that each classroom in our school will eventually include a
Mobile Media Center. That would be revolutionary in our district since few
rooms are now equipped that way. Moreover, sharing lessons among special
education students and others would move learning to a higher dimension,
since materials on disks could be copied and used in many classes by many
teachers and students.
<p>
A specific area the Proxima desktop projector would enhance would be
reading and language development. Most of the Learning Support students I
teach have a disability in the area of language development. "Reading
workshop" and the "writing process" are two teaching strategies used in
education today. Students would be able to share published writing with the
class via the Proxima/computer visuals. This format would be acceptable for
all levels of students. It would be possible to peer edit a student's
writing so everyone could participate, even those students with limited
language skills. Students with learning disabilities want to be able to
show their talents in the same manner as non-disabled students, and the
Proxima desktop projector could provide them with this opportunity.
<p>
Also, having a center or a projector would enable special education
students to read the same material together. Few trade books are available
in sufficient quantities for each student. But a group of students or an
entire class could read a Proxima visual projected from a novel or an
encyclopedia stored on a CD-ROM. When more than 200 classrooms and more
than 1,200 individual classes function in this way each day, education in
rural Shippensburg will be revolutionized.</font>

<font color = "CF0000"><B>Projecting Into The Future</B></font>
<p>
</center>

The primary objective of all of the programs at Spring Hill Middle School
is to prepare our children for the opportunities they will be presented
with in the future. As an outlying rural school, quite often these teachable moments don't appear at our door without much effort and planning on the part of our staff and community. However, with the onset of computer teleconferencing, we can link up with people from all over the world using
CU - See Me software and the appropriate audiovisual peripherals. Students
crowd around a computer screen to conference with their peers in Germany,
Israel, Norway or California to compare notes on a variety of topics. The
academic and multicultural benefits are often more memorable than those of
the best traditional presentations a gifted teacher could produce on these
regions.
<p>
It is our proposal to utilize the Proxima Desktop Projector 5100 and Mobile
Media Center to bring this form of telecommunications into our classrooms
during the most teachable moments. Scientists at the Kennedy Space Center,
Florida or artists at the Louvre in France would enter our classrooms through telecommunications received by our computer network and projected by the Proxima Desktop Projector 5100. Our experience would be incomplete without the associated background and visuals which would accompany such a presentation. Teacher-produced multimedia slides, pages downloaded from the Internet and laserdisc images coordinated through the computer system with the live interactions of the experts would predictably reach students' most preferred learning styles. Teachers would transform from knowledge
presenters to educational coordinators, sharing the learning experience with their students.
<p>
The majority of the classrooms in our school are interconnected by AV and
telecommunications lines which would allow most teachers the opportunity to roll in the Proxima Mobile Media Center and connect to the rest of the
world. Research by Bell Labs states that teleconferencing with images that
are at or near life size produce more productive interactions. While
children tend to lose their inhibitions more quickly in most social
situations, the ability to increase the dimensions of projected images
should make our students more capable in challenging academic encounters.
<p>
Since our school has a shared campus with High Springs Elementary School,
our peer tutoring programs would certainly involve our younger neighbors in
the projects related to their studies. Students teaching younger children
about the materials presented in this educational outreach would create a
more able group of youngsters who would move next door to the middle school
prepared to enter the realms of international learning. As each year
passes, the availability of opportunities will increase as will our
students' level of preparedness.
<p>
Many satellite and internet programs have already been developed with a
rich cadre of experts and materials. Student achievement will be measured
through support materials provided by the experts and staff, as well as
through learning portfolios and student/teacher produced multimedia
presentations.
<p>
As we "Project Into The Future" our students will be able to reach for new
horizons and realize new opportunities.</font>

<font color = "CF0000"><B>Newton's Laws Revealed in Real-Time</B></font>
<p>
</center>

The title of my proposed program is "Newton's Laws Revealed in Real-Time."
During this program, students will design experiments to investigate various concepts of motion; implement them; and collect, analyze and display their data. The students will be able to describe Newton's Laws and the effects of friction when finished with this program. The students will also develop skills in cooperation, communication and the use of technology.
<p>
To begin this program, have a toy car at the top of a ramp displayed at the
front of the room and the students in cooperative groups of three or four.
<p>
Lead a discussion about what the car would do if you just left it alone and if you gave it a push. Tell the students that this tendency of an object at rest to stay at rest and if in motion to stay in motion is called "inertia" and that there are many variables that affect it. Then have the groups brainstorm all the variables they can think of that might affect the car/ramp setup. Their lists might include the mass of the car, the shape of the car, the height of the ramp, etc. These can be listed on a chart for everyone to contemplate.
<p>
Then, with teacher guidance, have each group choose a variable they are interested in investigating, change it into a question (Does the height of the ramp affect the speed of the car? Which is faster, a car with greater or lesser mass?), and design an experiment that includes the use of appropriate computer sensors. Each group would be responsible for a different investigation and would need to be prepared to actually do the experiment in front of the class with the appropriate computer sensors. The computer would automatically graph the data as the experiment progresses and this would be displayed on a screen by a Proxima Desktop Projector for the whole class to see. The group in charge of the experiment would then lead a discussion with the rest of the class as to what conclusions could be drawn from the data. When a consensus is reached, the conclusion would be recorded by all and the next group would present.
<p>
This program allows students, with the help of technology, to become
facilitators of their own learning. They feel more in charge and thus become more excited about learning. The use of the Proxima Desktop Projector in conjunction with my computer equipped with sensors and EasyLog software allows all the students to participate in the investigations. This is a great improvement over the past when groups had to wait their turn at the computer and then spend an inordinate amount of time making displays so they could explain their investigation and conclusions to the rest of the
class. Using the Proxima Desktop Projector gets rid of the busywork and
allows the students to concentrate on the data analysis -- what can be
learned from this experiment? The Proxima Desktop Projector allows the
whole class to become involved and puts the "Real-Time" in Newton's Laws.</font>

<font color = "CF0000"><B>Expository Writing</B></font>
<p>
</center>

<B>Educational Objective:</B>
<br>
The student will view the process of writing a proper expository paragraph from its inception and brainstorming stages, through its revision, editing and proofreading stages, to the final copy. Then the student will write one him/herself by duplicating the process just observed. This will be completed by observing an incident in the classroom, discussing it, and then instantly watching ideas and sentences be developed and revised into a proper paragraph. This 1) gives immediate feedback to the students, and 2) addresses students with all models of learning styles including auditory, visual and tactile, allowing them to learn by seeing, hearing and doing -- all essentially important components to acquiring knowledge for the adult developmental student.
<p>
<B>Implementation Plan:</B>
<br>
1. The instructor will precede this particular instruction with an assignment of reading various paragraph models in the textbook. Ideally, this would have involved a discussion of the topic sentence, subtopic sentences, supporting details and finally the concluding sentence -- all parts of the well-written paragraph.
<p>
2. The instructor will use the Proxima DP2400 Desktop Projector to
illustrate the actual development of the paragraph in the classroom in the
following manner:
<menu>
a. The instructor will have someone come into the classroom, wearing an
outlandish outfit; a large straw hat adorned with daisies; perhaps clown
shoes; garish make-up including bright blue eye shadow, red lipstick and
bright red cheeks; old-out-of-date dress with "stuffed" bosom; carrying
accessories such as an umbrella, calculator, stuffed animal and a classroom
textbook. The dressed-up student will make a "noisy" entrance, perhaps
knocking on the door first and then falling over a chair inside the room.
Once the student sits down, he/she should make a grand announcement that
he/she is in the wrong room and quickly speed out. The remaining students'
task then is to write an illustrative paragraph, describing what just
occurred.<br>
b. A student should be asked to give a topic sentence about the event that
just occurred. The instructor will type it onto the computer so it may be
viewed on the overhead.<br>
c. Another student should be asked to give three main subtopic sentences,
describing the event. As they are dictated, the instructor also types them
into the computer so that they may be projected on the screen.
</menu>
3. After the outline is complete, the student should offer details that
could be inserted after the subtopic sentences to lend support. These
should be typed in as they are dictated.
<p>
4. This process should continue with the entire paragraph until a rough
draft of the paragraph is completed. The draft should be viewed together as
a class and then discussed as to what sentences might be "polished" and
how. The revisions can be made directly on the paragraph as the students
offer suggestions. The instructor should do this with the complete
paragraph.
<p>
5. The instructor will then have the students look for grammar errors.
Students offer suggestions for any corrections that they might see and the
instructor makes them as they are discussed so that the class can see them.
<p>
6. After all the revisions are completed, the students proofread. At this
time, the instructor might also demonstrate how the computer can
spell-check the paragraph. The instructor might also demonstrate how to use
other tools such as the thesaurus.
<p>
7. Finally, the instructor will discuss and review the steps in writing
that the students just demonstrated on this exercise.
<p>
8. They would then follow this exercise by composing their own paragraphs
by using the same steps and procedures that they just observed on the
overhead.</font>

<B>Educational Objectives</B>
<br>
Students in Industrial Technology (IT) need
exposure to professionals and experts from the working world. In addition,
these students need integrated activities that contain applied and "real
world" applications.
<p>
<B>Technology Model:</B>
<br>
A mobile media center will allow teachers to bring into the classroom experts and professionals from all over the world and
throughout history. Also by using this technology, students can apply their
academic training to "real world" problems and situations.
<p>
<B>Sample Lesson Plan:</B>
<br>
Title: Advertising Poster<br>
Concepts Covered: One and two point perspectives, design, writing and
advertising.<br>
IT Academy Courses: Tech Core, Tech Math, Tech English<br>
Time Requirement: 10 class sessions<br>
Grade Level: Ninth and 10th grades<br>
Number of students involved: 250
<p>
<B>General Description of Project:</B>
<br>
Students will create an advertising poster
for a science fiction or fantasy movie with an attached short story.
<p>
<B>Justification of Lesson:</B>
<br>
This is an interdisciplinary lesson that
integrates geometry, design, fine art, literature, advertising and
illustration.
<p>
Use of Mobile Media Center: Students will take a tour of all the great
museums of the world. They will see the development and application of one
and two point perspectives from ancient times through the Renaissance,
Baroque and up through the present with a look at movie special effects.
The greatest artists and illustrators throughout the world and history will
teach the IT Academy students via projected laser disc images.
<p>
<B>Step by Step Description of Lesson:</B>
<br>
Students will:<br>
1. Learn the mechanics of one and two point perspectives with emphasis on
buildings and city landscapes.<br>
2. Study historic examples of perspective from the laser disc library
(daily for 10-15 minutes).<br>
3. Discuss the historical and philosophical significance of perspective in
different time periods and cultures.<br>
4. Draw a city landscape in perspective incorporating buildings, signs,
streets, vehicles, plants, etc., using pencil on an 8 1/2 by 11 inch white
paper (rough draft, which is approved by the teacher).<br>
5. Redraw and improve the rough draft and color with colored pencils or
crayons on 8 1/2 by 11 inch paper (color study, which is approved by
teacher).<br>
6. Make an advertising poster based on the color study for a science
fiction or fantasy movie. Quality examples will be projected on the board
for further study.<br>
7. Draft a two-page short story which uses the landscape of the poster as
the setting (rough draft)<br>
8. Give story rough draft to another student to critique.<br>
9. Rewrite short story (finished draft). Quality examples will be projected
on the board for all students to read.<br>
<p>
<B>Evaluation of Lesson:</B>
<br>
Students will turn in a packet containing five documents: rough draft
drawing, color study, poster, rough draft story and finished draft story.<br>
* 4 - Packet complete, well-executed, story understandable.<br>
* 3 - Packet complete, minor problems with poster and/or story.<br>
* 2a - Packet complete, major problems with execution of perspective,
sloppy presentation, major problems with story.<br>
* 2b - Packet incomplete, missing one of the drafts or color study.<br>
* 1 - Packet incomplete, missing two drafts or color study.<br>
* 0 - Packet incomplete, missing three or more items.
<p>
<B>Implementation Plan:</B>
<br>
A battery of lesson plans have already been developed which would utilize a media center and projection system. Once a system has been acquired it would see use in the classroom immediately.</font>

Kentucky schools have undergone a tremendous change in the last five years.
We, as a state, have endeavored to provide an environment that is real world and holistic. No longer can we as educators look at our content as an isolated entity or individual skills. We must, in fact, broaden our concept of how our content fits into the student's life and his/her view of the future. Kentucky's educators are dedicated to this concept. We have restructured our whole education program by implementing KERA (Kentucky Education Reform Act).
<p>
One of the cornerstones of KERA is the infusion of technology into the curriculum. Technology, ideally, will be a part of everyday teaching as paper and pencil is at present. When I was a science teacher, it was important to have a group of students on the computer everyday. I am so dedicated to the concept of infusion, I have participated for three years as a PRISM (Promoting Reform In Science and Math) technology specialist and Instructional Technology Leaders. During my time with these organizations, I began to realize that the real value in technology lies with its ability to motivate and enthuse.
<p>
For instance, I can see a science teacher teaching a unit on weather. Students would track weather and make a climatic or daily chart for this area's weather. Students would initially do all work on construction paper, then plan what they would say as a weather forecaster. Finally, work would be done on a slide show package, such as Power Point. The student would then present their data using scientific terms and appropriate graphics. I see the potential in all areas. Social studies could do a news reel of the time being studied importing video and drawing graphics. Language arts could do a slide show play or defend a position. The uses are endless.
<p>
All of this would be more meaningful if projected on a screen. Students could be reassigned different areas of content to tell a different aspect, but learn and be responsible for all areas presented. Students would have a vested interest and would be more likely to take care and be more exact if peers, teachers, and parents were shown. It gives students ownership and allows for pride in the work done.
<p>
I also see how important it will be for professional development purposes in our school. It will allow material presented to our teachers to be presented in a motivating way and show them that technology can be used easily and effectively with anyone. I see teachers participating in their own professional development by taking on a segment of the learning (just as our students did) and use Power Point and the Proxima projector to present material. This encourages them to deal with new classroom techniques as well as becoming more comfortable with technology integration.
<p>
As a counselor I see technology as a way to promote communication. One way
I see using Proxima and the technology associated with it is to encourage
students in a group guidance situation to express themselves in a presentation form. They could explain who they see themselves as or explain
a difficult situation. Proxima would turn the eyes away from them and allow
them to talk freely. My students need to learn to view themselves as positive, valuable human beings. I strongly believe that technology frees many minds as it organizes a cluttered environment, meaning the middle school students. I envision students producing presentations on drug education, sexual harassment, self-esteem and many others. They will become peer tutors and everyone will have a turn.
<p>
All students should be involved in the well-being of their school. Proxima will be the key to many of their successes. I will initially target 60 students: 25 sixth graders, 25 seventh graders, and 10 eighth graders. These students, for the most part, will be at-risk students (grades and/or discipline). There will be a group session with me once a month to promote self-esteem. During these sessions, these students will be assigned the counseling theme of the
month. This will mean they will come up with activities and presentations
to use on their teams for the whole student body. I will view it and guide them to its appropriateness. In addition, these students would have priority status for use of this technology in the classroom and be allowed to use it in their regular classrooms. I am hopeful this will aid in their motivation and success in the classroom.
<p>
Assessment for the Proxima grant will be:
<menu>
* &#160The students' presentations and activities<br>
* &#160The students' success in the classroom.<br>
* &#160The students' discipline notification.<br>
* &#160A survey of their teachers.<br>
* &#160A survey of the students involved as well as a random survey of the
regular population.<br>
* &#160A written report from persons implementing this program.<br>
</menu>
<p>
All students will be involved in the use of technology to promote learning and self-esteem, but for assessment purposes I will target certain students in my population.
<p>
I am truly excited about Proxima and its uses in the school environment. School should never be boring. It should be dynamic and full of life. I feel strongly that technology aids in that goal. If our school achieves this goal, then learning will occur. Learning at that point cannot be stopped.</font>

<p>
</center>

<B>Objective:</B>
<br>
To use technology to provide an active cross-curricular learning
environment where students experience using technology as a tool.
<p>
<B>Proposal:</B>
<br>
I propose that a Proxima DP5100 Desktop Projector can meet the
needs of an entire classroom of students in a non-lab setting. While many
schools are still developing technology plans, computer labs are either
non-existent or they are reserved for basic applications and business
courses (word processing, keyboarding, etc.). I propose that the projector
is the future of classroom technology in that it can allow an entire class
to participate in a single task or project simultaneously.
<p>
<B>Technology model:</B>
<br>
The fifth and sixth grade music students currently use a multimedia production workstation. This workstation, based on the Macintosh Power PC 5300/100 CD/V, allows for digital video production, digital audio recording, music sequencing, music publishing, presentation authoring, individual/classroom tutoring, and CD-ROM-based instruction.
<p>
The workstation is mobile to accommodate moving between classrooms. (No
music room is currently available.) The addition of a desktop projector such as the Proxima DP5100  as a presentation and learning tool would greatly enhance the students' music learning experience because one computer monitor limits the workstation's effectiveness.
<p>
<B>Classroom Music:</B>
<br>
The fifth and sixth grade music students currently work on a number of projects that incorporate music and other disciplines. Following is just one example of these projects that demonstrate how the Proxima DP5100 Desktop Projector might be used.
<p>
<B>Project:</B>
<br>
Amazon Adventure--Sights and Sounds of the Tropical Rain Forest.
This project is part of a cross-curricular experience with the science
class unit on the rain forest.
<p>
<B>Time line:</B>
<br>
Two weeks (four 30-minute music classes).
<p>
<B>Materials:</B>
<br>
Orff instruments, synthesizer, individual music parts (in the
form of a tone poem--a story without words), presentation authoring
software, Tropical Rain Forest Reference CD-ROM, multimedia workstation,
Proxima DP5100 Desktop Projector.
<p>
<B>Rehearsal:</B>
<br>
In order to minimize the amount of equipment transported to each
classroom music session, the individual music parts are projected onto the
screen for the students to read, rather than using music stands.
Rather than using individual music flash cards or huddling 25 students
around a single monitor, music images are projected onto a single screen,
giving the instructor the instant ability to pace the class effectively. As
students become more proficient in their rehearsals, they are able to
memorize their music parts. The students now break into teams, each with
its own set of responsibilities, to create a presentation containing images
of the tropical rain forest directly correlating with the music examples.
An audio recording is made of the rehearsal, and the presentation is
authored with images from a rain forest reference CD-ROM that represents
the individual instrument groups (the rain stick represents rain, the
afuche represents insect sounds, etc.). The dress rehearsal synchronizes
the students' music performance with the presentation.
<p>
<B>Performance:</B>
<br>
The students perform Amazon Adventure as the finale of the
Spring Student Talent Show. Rather than presenting the project to the
entire student body, faculty, and parents on a single computer monitor or
television monitor, the presentation is projected on a screen for all to
appreciate.
<p>
<B>Student Evaluation:</B>
<br>
Evaluation is centered on three elements: student
performance, student knowledge, and student performance as part of a team.
Traditional and contemporary methods are used. Worksheets, class
discussions and quizzes assess individual knowledge. Playing tests on
instruments and student portfolios evaluate student performance as an
individual and as part of a team.
<p>
<B>System Effectiveness:</B>
<br>
The effectiveness of the system will be measured by several indicators.
* Student involvement in the subject matter: Is their participation more or
less active? Students who are more actively involved in content will
benefit more and are more likely to retain knowledge.
* Efficiency of presentation: Is the subject matter presented more
efficiently? Is more time used on instruction? Is content covered more
in-depth and is more subject matter covered?
* Student evaluation: Do students possess stronger understanding of subject
matter? Have class objectives been reached?</font>

<p>
</center>

In a time of shrinking budgets, many schools find themselves compelled to
cut field trips from school programs. This practice leaves students with
little or no idea of the world outside their communities. The Virtual Field
Trip's educational objective is to provide learners with the experience of
visiting interesting sites in a cost-efficient, yet unique fashion. In addition, it presents a model for classroom interaction that is useful across the curriculum.
<p>
Recent technological innovations, most notably the introduction of QuickTime VR (Apple Computers), have made the Virtual Field Trip possible. In addition, the ever-increasing number of QuickTime VR movies available via the Internet provide a wide range of field trip destinations. Finally, the cost of creating QuickTime VR movies is within the budget capabilities of most school sites.
<p>
In its simplest form, implementing the Virtual Field Trip requires only a
computer with the appropriate QuickTime VR software, an overhead projector
and LCD panel, and the QuickTime VR movie for the desired destination. With
this simple setup, teachers can take their class to Yosemite Valley, the San Francisco Golden Gate Bridge, Mt. Everest Base Camp or one of the many other movie destinations available. The ability to move forward and backward in QuickTime VR movies ensures that teachers would be able to point out specific items of interest in the scene as well as enhance the feeling of "being there."
<p>
The second level of the Virtual Field Trip requires a bit more equipment but still remains easily within the means of most schools. In this setup, a video camera is added to the original setup as well as a genlock, or a video editing board, with chromakey capability. With this equipment, teachers are able to "genlock" themselves or a group of students into the projected display, as is done with the weatherperson and weather map on television.
<p>
This setup requires that an area be set up in the classroom with a single color backdrop, usually blue, where the people who are to be put into the scene may stand. The video camera takes their picture and feeds it into the genlock or video editor which blends them into the QuickTime VR scene output by the first computer. Finally, this blended image is sent to the LCD panel for projection.
<p>
Setting up this equipment is not as daunting as it sounds. Many schools are
already utilizing genlocks or chromakeying in their video production classes. The Virtual Field Trip simply takes this proven technology to add an extra element of realism by integrating the images of the participants with the QuickTime VR movies. This is a powerful technique which allows students to serve as virtual tour guides of such educational sites as the Lincoln Memorial without ever leaving the classroom.
<p>
The third stage of the Virtual Field Trip would be for a school to purchase the digital camera and software necessary to author their own QuickTime VR movies. This additional investment would allow teachers to visit interesting sites and create field trip destinations for use back in their classrooms. In addition, students could create their own field trip destination for use in their classroom.
<p>
Regardless of which technology model is used in the classroom, the key element to the success of the Virtual Field Trip is a high quality projection panel or data projector. Fortunately, the cost of these LCD panels and projectors have dropped to the point that they are now affordable for classroom use. This affordability factor coupled with the free nature of the QuickTime VR software and movies means that the Virtual Field Trip can become a reality in almost any classroom.</font>

<p>
</center>

The objective of our proposal is to provide our foreign adult students with
the opportunity to expand their English language skills through an approach
that combines speech, pictures and text in a unique format.  This format will
allow students to learn English through the exploration of local information.
To put it simply, we would like to combine a multimedia projection system
with the latest speech recognition software and digitized video to let a class of students "tour" their new surroundings, learn vocabulary and advance through the software by voice input.
<p>
With students from Europe, Africa, Asia and South America -- all at different
skill levels -- it is not always easy to provide a classroom experience that
encourages conversation or allows people to get the information or the practice they need.
<p>
Students would work together as a group, orally, to identify objects, actions
and words in a way that gives them immediate feedback and defines progress
that can be put to use in the community. Texts cannot always portray action;
they become outdated with respect to product prices and seldom have direct relevance to day to day life. Our program could provide ongoing focus, catch things as they're happening in the area and reflect current interests of class members. 
<p>
Some information, of course, would be static -- getting a library card,
reading a menu or enrolling your child in school -- but it could be specific to the community and a model that could be replicated meaningfully in other places.
<p>
Students would have to pronounce things well enough to be understood by the
speech recognition software. Their voices would provide input like "buttons"
used with a mouse in conventional multimedia programming. This would necessitate practice or group effort to select the correct words and pronounce them properly. Students could use the programs individually or
progress through the safety of a group -- letting beginners improve their
receptive skills in a setting that wouldn't depend on translation by others.
<p>
This program would be combined with an analysis of each person's pronunciation capabilities to provide a database of words a person could speak easily. Some of the voice "buttons" could be triggered by a number of
synonyms, allowing a system that will give students the confidence to
establish connections they need to interact comfortably and be productive.
<p>
Students are initially interviewed and assessed when they enter the program.
Students are identified as beginner, intermediate or advanced.
<p>
The Test of Adult Basic Education is used for evaluation of progress. We have
some CD-ROM and computer-aided instruction but nothing that we can use in a
group setting or that encourages practice pronouncing words. A good projection system linked to relevant information that requires speech would
be an enormous asset to our program.
<p>
Bangor High School has a multimedia lab that we can use during off-hours that has the video and multimedia software we would need to digitize information for the program.
<p>
System requirements would include:
<menu>
- &#160A computer with a least 8 megabytes of RAM and a sound card<br>
- &#160Kurzweil or Dragon Systems voice recognition software<br>
- &#160A Proxima Desktop Projector<br>
- &#160Macromedia Director, Adobe Photoshop (we have access to), Avid Videoshop or Adobe Premiere video editing (we have), Microsoft Works database (we have)
</menu>
<p>
We are working on another grant to get the voice recognition system and are
currently designing the database that diagnoses pronunciation skills. Students will contribute to the development of the program by assisting in the selection and videotaping of places, things and activities. They will also assist in the data input for the pronunciation skills database.
<p>
The Learning Center will make this model available to any school or organization, such as Literacy Volunteers, that would like to use it or draw
from it in the design of their own program. We will inform people about the
program at the Learning Center, through press releases and public service announcements, and on the home page of the Bangor Area Information Resources Network.</font>

<p>
</center>

The primary objective of all of the programs at Spring Hill Middle School
is to prepare our children for the opportunities they will be presented
with in the future. As an outlying rural school, quite often these teachable moments don't appear at our door without much effort and planning on the part of our staff and community. However, with the onset of computer teleconferencing, we can link up with people from all over the world using
CU - See Me software and the appropriate audiovisual peripherals. Students
crowd around a computer screen to conference with their peers in Germany,
Israel, Norway or California to compare notes on a variety of topics. The
academic and multicultural benefits are often more memorable than those of
the best traditional presentations a gifted teacher could produce on these
regions.
<p>
It is our proposal to utilize the Proxima Desktop Projector 5100 and Mobile
Media Center to bring this form of telecommunications into our classrooms
during the most teachable moments. Scientists at the Kennedy Space Center,
Florida or artists at the Louvre in France would enter our classrooms through telecommunications received by our computer network and projected by the Proxima Desktop Projector 5100. Our experience would be incomplete without the associated background and visuals which would accompany such a presentation. Teacher-produced multimedia slides, pages downloaded from the Internet and laserdisc images coordinated through the computer system with the live interactions of the experts would predictably reach students' most preferred learning styles. Teachers would transform from knowledge
presenters to educational coordinators, sharing the learning experience with their students.
<p>
The majority of the classrooms in our school are interconnected by AV and
telecommunications lines which would allow most teachers the opportunity to roll in the Proxima Mobile Media Center and connect to the rest of the
world. Research by Bell Labs states that teleconferencing with images that
are at or near life size produce more productive interactions. While
children tend to lose their inhibitions more quickly in most social
situations, the ability to increase the dimensions of projected images
should make our students more capable in challenging academic encounters.
<p>
Since our school has a shared campus with High Springs Elementary School,
our peer tutoring programs would certainly involve our younger neighbors in
the projects related to their studies. Students teaching younger children
about the materials presented in this educational outreach would create a
more able group of youngsters who would move next door to the middle school
prepared to enter the realms of international learning. As each year
passes, the availability of opportunities will increase as will our
students' level of preparedness.
<p>
Many satellite and internet programs have already been developed with a
rich cadre of experts and materials. Student achievement will be measured
through support materials provided by the experts and staff, as well as
through learning portfolios and student/teacher produced multimedia
presentations.
<p>
As we "Project Into The Future" our students will be able to reach for new
horizons and realize new opportunities.</font>

<I>Cleaning the Protective Glass</I> 

<P>

To clean the top or bottom protective glass, put a small amount

of glass cleaner on a soft cloth or lens cleaning tissue. Gently

wipe the glass plate to remove any accumulated dust or grit.

<P>

<I>Temperature Extremes</I> 

<P>

Liquid crystals will freeze at low temperatures. There's no harm

in this. If your panel is ever exposed to extremely cold temperatures,

allow it to warm to room temperature before use.

<H3>DP2xxx Projector Maintenance</H3>



<HR>



<P>

There is very little effort required to care for and maintain

your Desktop Projector. Common sense and periodic maintenance

will ensure top performance. An optional maintenance kit is available.

It includes the following materials: two halogen lamps, lens cleaning

fluid, lens tissue, top and front air filters, and a can of compressed

air.

<P>

The lamps, lenses, mirrors, and LCD panel have been carefully

aligned at the factory to give you the clearest, brightest image

possible. However, mishandling your projector can misalign or

damage the optical elements. Be careful when you use or move your

projector.

<P>

<B>CAUTION!</B> The projector contains sensitive circuitry

and optics. Protect it from potential fluid spills.

<P>

<B><I>Cleaning the Lens and Mirror</I></B> 

<OL>

<LI>Take a piece of lens tissue and form it into a loose swab.

Wet it with lens cleaning fluid or denatured alcohol, and gently

move it over the lens or mirror surface.

<LI>Take a part of the lens tissue that you haven't touched, and

repeat the process, going over the lens or mirror in another direction.

<LI>Repeat steps 1 and 2 until no smudges or particles can be

seen when the lens or mirror is illuminated by a strong light.

DO NOT LOOK DIRECTLY IN THE LENS WHEN THE LAMP IS ON!

</OL>

<P>

If the lens or mirror is extremely dirty, use several pieces of

lens tissue. Water may be used if denatured alcohol is unavailable.

<P>

<B>CAUTION!</B> Do not use acetone to clean the lens.

It may remove the paint from the metal near the lens or mirror

mount and leave a residue on the glass surface.

<P>

<B><I>Switching Lamps</I></B> 

<P>

If your projector lamp burns out during a presentation, the LAMP

SELECTOR switch allows you to quickly change to a backup lamp.

<P>

You can switch lamps on the fly, without turning off your projector

or interrupting your presentation. Push the LAMP SELECTOR switch

to its opposite position. It will click into place and the alternate

lamp will illuminate.

<P>

<B><I>Replacing Lamps</I></B> 

<P>

Follow these steps to remove the lamp and install a new one.

<P>

<I>Removing the Old Lamp</I> 

<OL>

<LI>Leave the projector running with the lamp off for at least

6 minutes before you change the lamp (to do this, press the lamp

button to turn the lamp off). This allows the fan to cool the lamp

chamber. Do not open the lamp chamber until the projector has

cooled.<P>

<LI>After the lamp chamber has cooled sufficiently, turn off the

projector, unplug the power cord from the wall socket, and remove

the power cord from the projector's power receptacle. As a safety

feature, you cannot open the lamp chamber unless the cord is removed.<P>

<LI>Move the lamp chamber latch to the right. The cover will unlatch

and partially open.<P>

<LI>Lift the cover until it stops. <I>Do not force the cover!</I>

The lamp chamber is now accessible.

<P>

<B>CAUTION!</B> The lamp and chamber get very hot. Be

careful when you open the lamp chamber or change the lamp. Make

sure that the fan has cooled the lamp and chamber for at least

6 minutes.<P>

<B>Note:</B> Do not touch the lamp with your bare hands.

Use a soft cloth or tissue.<P>

<LI>Find the lamp release lever at the base of the ceramic lamp

socket. Push the lever to the outside to release the lamp. Remove

the old lamp and replace it with a new one.<P>

<LI>To close the chamber, firmly press down on the center rear

edge of the cover until it latches. The lamp chamber latch will

return to the center position. The power plug is now accessible.<P>

<LI>Replace the power cord.<P>

</OL>

<P>

<B><I>Changing Air Filters</I></B> 

<P>

To assure proper cooling, change or clean the three air intake

filters after every 250 hours of operation. These filters are

located on the left or right sides at the front of the projector's

lower case and under the grill in the top cover.

<P>

<I>Front Air Intake Filter Assemblies</I>

<OL>

<LI>Release latches are located on the lower portion of the two

front filter grill assembly frames. Push these up as you pull

the grill assemblies out.<P>

<LI>Remove the foam air filters.<P>

<LI>Depending on their condition, clean or replace the filters.

To clean a filter, wash it in a mild solution of soapy water,

rinse and let it dry. To replace a filter, contact Proxima Customer

Service.<P>

<LI>Clean the grill vents using a cloth or a can of compressed

air.<P>

<LI>Reassemble the air filter grill assemblies and replace them.<P>

</OL>

<P>

<I>Top Air Intake Filter Assemblies</I>

<OL>

<LI>To release the top air filter assembly, place both thumbs

into the two depressions located on the rear of the top filter

grill assembly frame. Press down and back towards the rear of

the unit. The front edge of the grill will pop up.<P>

<LI>Grasp the front edge of the grill and lift it out.<P>

<LI>On the bottom side of the assembly there is a retaining grid.

Grasp the tab at the center and remove it.<P>

<LI>Remove the foam air filter.<P>

<LI>Depending on its condition, clean or replace the filter.<P>

<LI>Clean the grill vents using a cloth or a can of compressed

air.<P>

<B>CAUTION!</B> Be careful not to aim the stream of

air directly into the fans' intake as this could force dust particles

inside the unit.<P>

<LI>Reassemble the air filter assembly and replace it.

</OL>

<P>

<I>Temperature Extremes</I> 

<P>

The projector should not be stored in excess of 140 degrees F

(60 degrees C). The ideal operating temperature is below 80 degrees

F (27 degrees C). If the projector has been exposed to extremely

cold temperatures, allow it to warm up to room temperature before

operating.

</OL>

<P>

<B><I>Replacing the Lamp</I></B> 

<P>

Metal Halide lamps are much brighter and have much longer lives

than halogen lamps. Since metal halide lamps rarely &quot;burn

out,&quot; they are usually replaced when the lamp dims to 50%

of its original brightness. This is typical after 700-800 hours

of operation for a DP5xxx lamp.

<OL>

<LI>To replace the lamp,<P>

<LI>Turn off the projector.<P>

<LI>Unplug the projector's power cord from the wall socket and

remove the power cord from the projector's power receptacle.<P>

<LI>Unscrew the screw located on the right side of the rear panel

and remove the service door.<P>

<LI>Unscrew the lamp module retaining screws (they will not come

out).<P>

<B>CAUTION!</B> The lamp module gets very hot during

operation. Use appropriate care when changing lamps. Make sure

that the lamp module has cooled for at least 3 to 5 minutes.<P>

<LI>Grasp the handle located on the rear of the lamp module and

firmly pull the lamp module straight out.<P>

<LI>Replace the old lamp module with a new lamp module, carefully

aligning the power pins on the bottom and pressing firmly into

place. When it is properly placed, a small alignment mark etched

on the projector chassis will be visible below the lamp module.<P>

<LI>Screw the two lamp module retaining screws down flush.<P>

<LI>Replace the service door and screw it into place.<P>

<LI>Replace the power cord.<P>

</OL>

<P>

<B><I>Cleaning the Air Filter</I></B> 

<P>

You should change or clean the air intake filter after every 100

operating hours to maintain proper cooling. This filter is located

on the bottom of the projector, under the grill.

<OL>

<LI>Disconnect all cables/cords from the projector.

<LI>Set the projector on its side, connector panel down.

<LI>Remove both screws on the filter cover.

<LI>Press up on the air filter cover tab to release the cover

latch as you pull the grill assembly out.

<LI>Clean the air filter using a vacuum cleaner after you have

disassembled it. If dirt is still present, wipe the air filter

with a cloth moistened with water, then wipe it with a dry cloth.

<LI>Reassemble and re-install the air filter.

</OL>

<P>

<H3>8300/8400 Projector Maintenance</H3>



<HR>



<P>

There is very little effort required to care for and maintain

your Proxima 8300/8400 Projector. Common sense and periodic maintenance

will ensure top performance.

<P>

The lamps, lenses, mirrors, and LCD panel have been carefully

aligned at the factory to give you the clearest, brightest image

possible. However, mishandling your projector can misalign or

damage the optical elements. Be careful when you use or move your

projector.

<P>

<B>CAUTION!</B> The projector contains sensitive circuitry

and optics. Protect it from potential fluid spills.

<P>

<B><I>Air Filter Care and Cleaning</I></B> 

<P>

The removable air filter prevents dust from accumulating on

the surface of the projection lens and projection mirror. Should

the air filter become clogged with dust particles, it will reduce

the cooling fan's effectiveness and may result in internal heat

build up and reduce the life of the projection lamp.<P>

To clean the air filter, follow the cleaning procedures below:<P>

<OL>

<LI>Turn the POWER (LAMP) ON/OFF button OFF.<P>

<LI>Remove the air filter cover from the side of the projector.<P>

<LI>Remove the air filter and sponge from the filter cover.<P>

<LI>Clean the air filter and sponge with a vacuum cleaner.<P>

<LI>Replace the air filter and sponge. Make sure that air filter

cover is fully inserted.<P>

</OL>

<P>

<B>CAUTION!</B> Do not clean with water. Doing so may

damage the air filter. Do not operate the projector with air filter

removed.

<P>

<B><I>Lamp Replacement Indicator</I></B> 

<P>

When the lamp nears the end of its service life, the picture quality

and color quality will deteriorate and the orange lamp replacement

indicator will light.

<P>

<B>CAUTION! DO NOT ATTEMPT TO REMOVE OR CHANGE THE PROJECTION

LAMP. THE LAMP CAN ONLY BE CHANGED BY QUALIFIED SERVICE PERSONNEL.</B>

<p>
<font size = "+1">Digital Light Processing (DLP) technology enables the <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> <A HREF="newdp4100z.html">Desktop Projector 4100z</A> to digitally control light as it creates images. Hundreds of thousands of digital light-switch micromirrors reflect beams of light to create and project an entire picture. These mirrors turn on or off hundreds of times per second to enhance detailed images. DLP picture elements ensure straight lines and sharp edges.
<p>
DLP projection technology displays every pixel evenly from one corner of the screen to the other. The distance between pixels is so minute (1/100 the thickness of a human hair) that images are projected with no observable lines between pixels. This means images are clear and crisp.
<p>
The DLP engine also uses a special lamp designed to provide the most uniform image possible. All of these elements combine to provide photo-realistic picture quality that is visually astounding.

<H2>MediaExpress lets you concentrate on <br>
your message instead of your method.</H2>
</center>

<IMG SRC="gifs/medex.gif" align = right width = 285 height = 191 hspace = 5>
<font size = "+2"><B>T</B></font><font size = "+1">he MediaExpress image display system adds yet another valuable feature to your <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font>&#174; Desktop Projector. <A HREF="../Solutions/proxima.cgi?template=item.html&item=MediaExpress&sction=Description">MediaExpress</A> makes it easy to deliver electronic presentations, without the computer, the cables, or the worry.
Creating a presentation with MediaExpress is easy. Use your favorite presentation software program to create electronic slides. Save them to a PC-formatted floppy disk and insert the disk into the MediaExpress drive in your Desktop Projector. Now you're ready to start the show.
<p>
MediaExpress "plays" your images without any complicated setup. Use the forward and reverse keys on the included Cyclops&#174; remote to control your presentation. It's that easy. Use MediaExpress to make your ideas look good, without worrying about all of the things that can go wrong.
<p>
<B>Based on the industry standard for sharing documents</B> 
<p>
<IMG SRC="gifs/media_logo.gif" align = left width = 180 height = 28 hspace = 6>One of the truly remarkable features of MediaExpress is that it's based on Adobe&#174; Acrobat&#174; and Portable Document Format (PDF)-the standard for sharing electronic information internally and across the World Wide Web.
<p>
<A HREF="frame_adobe2.html"><IMG SRC="gifs/acrobat_logo.gif" align = right border = none width = 88 height = 31 hspace = 6></A>Use the <A HREF="frame_adobe2.html">Adobe Acrobat software</A>  that comes with your MediaExpress to quickly and easily create PDF files on your PC or Macintosh. Simply select the Adobe Acrobat PDF Writer as your printer and print. When MediaExpress "plays back" the PDF file, it looks just like your original-whether it's a spreadsheet, a presentation, or any other electronic document.

<A HREF="frame_adobe1.html"><IMG SRC="gifs/adobe_logo.gif" align = left border = none width = 92 height = 72 hspace = 4></A><A HREF="frame_adobe1.html">Adobe Acrobat</A> allows you to gather content from any platform, because it supports PC, Macintosh, and UNIX systems and PostScript files. Adobe Acrobat and MediaExpress make it easy for you to present information from any computer system, your company's network, or even the Internet.
<p>
<B>Powerful and easy to use</B> 
<p>
MediaExpress is simple to use, allowing you to concentrate on your message instead of your computer. But it doesn't economize on power or flexibility. MediaExpress has everything you need to handle high impact presentations with ease.
<p>
MediaExpress includes Adobe Acrobat Exchange software for your computer that enables you to add transition effects, create links between pages, and combine images from different applications or computer platforms. When your presentation is loaded into MediaExpress, you can hide pages and modify transition effects directly from your Desktop Projector-without ever having to go back to your computer.
<p>
Your presentation will always look its best-whether you're using a high-resolution XGA projector or a more typical VGA model. MediaExpress displays at the exact resolution that you need. You can also use MediaExpress to zoom in on your image, highlighting important parts of your presentation with exact detail.
<p>
<B>Reliable and worry-free</B>
<p>
Not only does MediaExpress deliver the best quality, it delivers reliability. Any PDF file plays in any MediaExpress-and it works every time. For simple electronic presentations, MediaExpress gives you the power and flexibility to express your ideas without struggling with a computer. It's the complete, self-contained, image display solution. 
<p>
<B>Features</B>
<p>
<UL>
<LI>Transforms Desktop Projector into self-contained, image display system with no cables to connect
<LI>Uses Adobe Acrobat Player for sharing and displaying information
<LI>Simple, intuitive controls make it easy to use

<font size = "+2"><B>T</B></font><font size = "+1">HE <font color = "FF0000">Proxima&#174;</font> Desktop Projector 5500 projects color images at 500 ANSI lumens-making it the brightest projector in its class. It displays images that are up to 30 feet diagonally. Colors are vivid and fully-saturated and the images are exceptionally sharp. Even the biggest images do not appear washed out, faded, or fuzzy. And, a brightly lit room is never a worry.
<p>
With an appealing mix of standard features, the <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> Desktop Projector 5500 offers exceptional-quality multimedia projection in one convenient package. The <A HREF="../Solutions/proxima.cgi?template=item.html&item=DP5500&sction=Description">Desktop Projector 5500</A> includes two computer and two video inputs which make it simple to connect multiple presenters. This VGA projector can also handle SVGA images, giving it wider computer compatibility. Its motorized zoom lens lets you position the projector anywhere in the room. The 1.6:1 range of this lens is the widest available on any projector in its class. This provides greater flexibility not only in placement, but in image size and therefore audience size. The Desktop Projector 5500 also includes a remote that makes controlling your presentation easy. It has zoom and focus buttons, as well as a "joystick" which provides mouse-like control of the PC computer.

</center>

<IMG SRC="gifs/proj2910.gif" align = left width = 241 height = 180 hspace = 6>
<font color = "FF0000"><font size = "+2"><B>P</B></font></font><font size = "+1"><font color = "FF0000">roxima</font> Corporation announces the introduction of the <A HREF="../Solutions/proxima.cgi?template=item.html&item=DP2910&sction=Description">Desktop Projector 2910</A> -- the industry's brightest LCD multimedia projector.  The new projector provides accurate, high-quality projection of computer and video images rated at an unprecedented 650 ANSI lumens, according to Michael Chaffin, <font color = "FF0000">Proxima's</font> chief operating officer.  This extraordinary brightness fulfills long-standing market requirements for clear projection in presentations to large audiences and in high ambient light environments.
<p>
The newest member of <font color = "FF0000">Proxima's</font> award-winning Desktop Projector product line, the DP2910 is an enhanced version of the DP2900 projector.  The new model offers refinements in uniformity and consistency, and also provides a more efficient cooling system and quieter operation.  Connected to a PC-compatible or Macintosh computer, the DP2910 projects clear, brilliant images at VGA resolution (640-by-480 dpi) in 2 million colors from a palette of 16.7 million colors.  It can also display most SGVA images (800-by-600 dpi) in a windowed view.
<p>
"The DP2910 effectively establishes a new image brightness standard for LCD multimedia projectors," Chaffin said.  "With this projector, presenters can deliver dynamic computer-based presentations without darkening the room, allowing them to maintain the eye contact with their audiences that is so vital to the overall impact of their communications."
<p>
The DP2910 weighs just over 22 pounds, and incorporates advanced ergonomics and a compact design that offers virtually the same user-friendly interface as a standard desktop computer peripheral.  In addition, it includes a stereo audio output system and state-of-the-art digital video controller that projects exceptionally sharp, uniform video images in all three international video standards (NTSC, PAL, and SECAM), as well as S-VHS.
<p>
By adding <font color = "FF0000">Proxima's</font> optional Cyclops&#174; interactive pointer system, which functions as a cordless mouse, users essentially have a complete, all-in-one desktop projection solution.  "With Cyclops, presenters can pull down menus, open files, and perform other interactive  tasks from up to 40 feet away from their computer," said Chaffin.
<p>
The DP2910 is designed to meet the needs of corporate and individual users in both presentation and workgroup applications.  In addition to being ideal for use in larger conference rooms under challenging light conditions, the compact, light-weight projector fits easily into an airplane overhead luggage compartment.  "It's the perfect tool for traveling executives, field sales people, corporate presenters and trainers in a variety of industries, as well as educators and government professionals," Chaffin said.
<p>
Available through <font color = "FF0000">Proxima's</font> authorized resellers, the DP2910 sells for a suggested retail price of $7,995 U.S.  For more information please contact <font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> Corporation at 619/457-5500.
<p>
<font color = "FF0000">Proxima</font> is a leading developer, manufacturer and marketer of Desktop Projection products that bring the power of the computer to the workgroup.  These systems increase the productivity and effectiveness of business meetings, interactive workgroup sessions, training, and computer-based presentations.  The company's headquarters are in San Diego, California.

<TITLE> Presentation Science - The Presentation Environment (Page 3) </TITLE>
</HEAD>

<BODY bgcolor="FFFFFF" vlink="AF0040" alink="04BC04">

<center>
<A HREF="univ_science.map"><IMG SRC="gifs/science_header.gif" width = 600 height = 114  ISMAP border = none alt = "Presentation Science"></A>
<H2>The Presentation Environment</H2>
<table width = 598>
	<tr>
		<td><font size = +1><menu>
<B>What is the smallest font size I can use when I design my presentation?</B>
<p>
The previous discussions addressed the minimum recommended image size and graphic/character height for any particular viewing distance. The question you're probably asking now is, "How does minimum character height at 20 feet equate to font size on my 13" monitor screen?" Once again, simple math can help us arrive at the answer.
<p>
We know that at a 20 foot viewing distance:
<br>
<menu>
<B>*</B>	Minimum recommended image height is 2.5 feet<br>
<B>*</B>	Minimum visible character height is 0.7 inches
</menu>
<p>

<center>
<IMG SRC="gifs/science7.gif" width = 422 height = 104>
<p>
</center>

First we have to determine the percentage of the image occupied by the minimum visible character height. If we divide the minimum visible character height (0.7 inches) by minimum image height (converted to inches; 2.5 feet x 12), we will have the percentage.
<p>
<menu>
0.7 / (2.5 x 12)  =  0.7 / 30  =  2.33% of the vertical image height
</menu>
<p>
To find the vertical image height of your 13" monitor, apply the 3:4:5 (vertical:horizontal:diagonal) screen image proportion rule. The vertical height of the monitor image is 3/5 (60%) of the diagonal image size (13 inches) of your monitor.
<p>
<menu>
.60 x 13 = 7.8 inch vertical image height.
</menu>
<p>
Now multiply the vertical image height of your monitor (7.8 inches) by the minimum recommended character height percentage of screen image (2.33%) to find the first part of the answer.
<p>
<menu>
7.8 x .0233  =  0.182 in. minimum recommended image height on a 13" monitor
</menu>
<p>
To reach the final part of your answer, calculate the actual font size. There are 72 points in an inch of font, so multiply 72 by 0.182 to find the minimum recommended font size for any size projected image.
<p>
<menu>
72 x 0.182  =  13.1<br>
So . . . 14</font><sup><font size = "-2">*</font></sup><font size = +1> is the smallest recommended font size to use in a projected image.</font>

<B>Description/Objectives</B>
<p>
Business education teacher Lucie Podd has proposed to include a new "Electronic Publishing" course as part of the business education curriculum at North Country Union High School in Newport, Vermont.  The course will utilize and instruct students on the use of multimedia applications and equipment.  The student objectives are as follows:  
<p>
<menu>
-	Improve communication skills; <br>
-	Develop leadership skills;  <br>
-	Learn to use new technologies; <br>
-	Instruct staff from other disciplines about the power of using desktop projection units and multimedia to transform and enhance instruction; <br>
-	Introduce the local community to the effectiveness of combining desktop projection equipment with multimedia.
</menu>
<p>
<B>Implementation</B>
<p>
The course will be implemented through the business education department to second year students who have already learned to touch type, use Windows-based word processing, spreadsheets, databases, and telecommunication.
<p>
Stage 1:  Training.  Utilize the desktop projector to facilitate training students on the tools.
<p>
Stage 2: Teaming Up/Selecting Projects.  Each student will be responsible for creating three multimedia projects, while collaborating with members from different areas of the school or local community.  Projects must have a useful purpose as a completed work, and must introduce others to the power of multimedia in the communication process (written and oral).
<p>
<menu>
Project 1:  Create a web page representing one facet of the educational community;
<p>
Project 2:  Create a web page representing one facet of the local community;
<p>
Project 3:  Assist one teacher in the creating of a multimedia presentation to enhance instruction.
</menu>
<p>
Stage 3:  Use the available technology, local resources, and teamwork to complete the projects.  Collaboration will insure consistency, and students will learn to recognize, appreciate and use each others' strengths for improved results.  Leadership skills will be developed as they collaborate with others outside the classroom.  Desktop projection equipment used to communicate their vision.
<p>
Stage 4:  Presentations to community groups (Rotary Club, etc.), academic departments, groups within the school, and elementary schools.  
<p>
Stage 5:  Measurement & Assessment.  A pre-and post-project assessment tool will be developed to measure the increase in students' technical and communication skills.  Success measurement will be through self-evaluation, peer evaluation and teacher evaluation. The impact on the school and community will be measured by the number of students, staff, and community members introduced to multimedia throughout the year.
<p>
<B>Technology Model</B>
<p>
The business education classroom lab includes 20 networked IBM-compatible computers, a laser and dot matrix printers, a flatbed color scanner, a still video capture tool, and QuickCam.  Five of the computer stations are connected to the Internet.  All computers have Microsoft Office and Internet Assistant loaded.  Some are equipped with Corel Draw and Hyperstudio.  The addition of Proxima's mobile media center will greatly enhance the model's capability.</font>

<p>
</center>

Just four years ago, teacher Tim Comolli founded the "Imaging Lab" which, due to its success, has become the technology center of South Burlington High School in South Burlington, Vermont. The lab provides classes and services for students (particularly at-risk students), teachers and the townspeople. 
<p>
Today, the lab's growth has been greatly enhanced with the addition of an academic class called "Electronic Arts."  In a twist on the usual model of instruction, students are the primary teachers for the classes.  They instruct staff development courses, and teach parents in an evening course sponsored by the South Burlington Recreation Department. 
<p>
The lab has a professional graphics operation that offers instruction on all of the popular computer platforms, including Amiga, DOS, Mac and Silicon Graphics. Local business people even utilize the students for professional graphics work. 
<p>
With a desktop projection system, students and teachers will be able to exhibit materials and make presentations to the entire Electronic Arts class at once. And, with a projector as mobile as their ideas, they can successfully implement the final stage of their projects. They can take their class "on the road" to make presentations throughout the high school, as well as at local middle and elementary schools.</font>

		<td valign = top><font size = "+1">In the Farmingdale Public Schools District, teachers and students alike are making impressive presentations, thanks to the Proxima Desktop Projector 2750.
<p>
While teachers are discovering what a useful instructional tool the Desktop Projector is, students as young as fourth grade are learning to share information with their classmates in a whole new way.  According to Marie Colalucci, Director of Business/Computer Education, "The students experiment with a lot of different software programs, like LinkWay and   
HyperStudio for Windows.  With the Desktop Projector, they can share   
the content of their work not only with their teachers but with their fellow students.  It's a much more interactive process."
<p>
Colalucci further stated that among teachers, one of the most popular uses for the Desktop Projector is to display student portfolios which are bibliographies of their best work from the year.
<p>
Although the district has used LCD projection equipment in the past, images literally paled in comparison to the Desktop Projector's.  "The old LCD panels couldn't handle the enormous number of colors our Desktop Projector displays.  Nor could they support video.  They were sufficient for text-only demonstrations, and that was about it," Colalucci said.  By contrast, the Desktop Projector has full multimedia capabilities.  "We hook it up to CD-ROMs and laser discs, so it allows us to take advantage of the wealth of multimedia instructional materials available.  The images are phenomenal!"</td>

<p>
</center>

There are many difficulties that an instructor must face in an inter-city
school system. I intend to use a combination of technologies based around a
Proxima display device to overcome a few of these.
<p>
One of the problems that I have when I demonstrate a manual drafting skill
to my 25 beginning students is that they cannot see all the detailed methods used in the drawing. I plan to use a two-camera video system mounted to a drafting table and projected on a large 12-foot by 12-foot screen to overcome this problem. This will allow our students to view -- via the large screen -- the details, hand positions, pencil positions, and proper methods needed to do their drawings correctly. Multiple camera placement is critical for the students to be able to see what is being done. Even with a small group of students, it is difficult to see because the drafter's hands block the view of what is being done. With multiple viewing angles students will be able to view what is being done anywhere in my 2,000-square-foot room.
<p>
To view the actual drawing is only the first step in the process. The system I envision will not be a simple projection system. My students also need visual notes. These notes will be displayed on a computer and switched to the large screen as each point is demonstrated.
<p>
New notes will be added each time a new step is completed and displayed on
the screen. The output from the camera and computer will be fed to a videotape unit. This videotape will allow students to later review the drawing process independently at their desks, on their own screens, at their own pace, and pause to complete a drawing step if needed.
<p>
I plan to use these videos as a tool to help my students that have attendance problems, as well. Currently, there is not enough time to review missed assignments, start new assignments and help students with individual problems. By using a combination of large-screen projection, video review,
missed assignment review and note skill development, I hope to improve the
overall success rate of my students.
<p>
The last area that I hope to improve upon is the speed at which my students
do their assignments. I plan to do paced assignments on the large screen at
the beginning of each hour. These assignments will not contain new information or techniques. The main focus will be on quality and speed. The
students must follow along at their own boards, drawing the same drawing
that I am, at the same time and just as quickly. Using this technique, I hope to increase the number and quality of their drawings, and improve their drawing speed and drafting technique.
<p>
<B>Project Evaluation</B>
<br>
Once this system has been in place for a semester, I will review the grades and quantity of work they have completed. I will look closely at the students that have learning disabilities and attendance problems to see if they have, as a group, improved. I will compare this to the previous semesters that I have taught using low tech or no tech tools.  The results of these comparisons will determine how effective the system is.
<p>
<B>Technology Equipment Model</B>
<br>
To implement this project I intend to interconnect two video cameras, a PC-based computer with a word processor program, and a large-screen projection system -- all connected to a video recording system. The students will also have several video playback systems available to view prerecorded demonstrations.</font>

</center>

In the past, teacher Knan Lee was only able to instruct six students at a time in video editing to produce WXEL News Live at the Phoenix Center School in Ocala, Florida. With a desktop projector, the entire class will be able to see the process and collectively make editing decisions.
<p>
The desktop projector will be integrated with a computer, two VCRs, video sketch titler and video camera to create a live broadcast news program. The projector will enable every student, regardless of individual learning style or learning disability, to participate in the writing and editing of the broadcast, and experience success.  In addition, the ability to project video images will command the attention and imagination of at-risk students to maintain interest and involvement.
<p>
When the actual broadcast takes place, the desktop projector will be used in concert with the computer and VCRs to project background images, weather maps and video tapes behind student anchors. The level of professionalism of the news broadcast will be a source of pride and accomplishment that will positively impact students.  Students will also develop a sense of partnership and ownership in the final news production.</font>

Tomorrow's classroom will provide students with innovative ways to envision
their futures as they explore various technological pathways to enhance their communicative skills and global learning. In the communications or journalism class, for example, students could utilize the Internet to update
commentary to support their lead news story, synthesizing articles which may be incorporated into the weekly school newspaper layout. Then, projecting the tabloid page on the large screen utilizing the Proxima DP5100 Desktop Projector, the staff may critique the entire page. They could view readable print and artwork that heretofore remained an impossibility -- rendering the standard overhead projector obsolete. The instructor would thus effortlessly capture students' attention, capitalizing on the teachable moment to review layouts and to conduct on-screen editing. This would invite students to engage in the thinking/revising process and demonstrate "live lessons" created with the whole class actively participating.
<p>
With clarity, precision, and movability, the Mobile Media Center -- featuring
the desktop projector and the multimedia Pentium laptop computer mounted on the media cart -- may be rolled from classroom to classroom to demonstrate multimedia presentations that students have created, such as a two-minute spot recorded by a camcorder fed through the laptop and projected to the whole class. Students may select from varied projects, including taping "on-the-street" interviews which may be shared during class discussion or capturing still images with a digital camera to illustrate a research report presented through the use of the overhead.
<p>
<B>Educational Objectives</B>
<br>
* Students in photography and film production classes will utilize existing
cameras and editing equipment to produce short campus news clips and information videos averaging two to five minutes. These will be incorporated into scripts prepared by journalism students utilizing desktop publishing and overhead projection. Once a week, students will broadcast news clips about live-action sports, club activities, special events and special projects as they wheel the Mobile Media Center into homerooms for school news and announcements.
<p>
* In journalism and communications classes, students will complete one
multimedia group research project per semester. They will focus on a current event and use available resources in the technology lab (word processing and on-line research), keeping in mind that their final projects (which may utilize sound bites and video) will be presented on a large screen to the whole class.
<p>
* In day-to-day classroom instruction, the teacher may provide directed
learning as needed by demonstrating on-line searches and conducting whole-class activities while navigating the Internet. Thus, the Mobile Media Center becomes not only a tool, but an entire new way of envisioning learning. It will explore our reality as it immediately unfolds, from "live-editing" to on-the-spot recording. It will transmit instantaneous classroom information, and revitalize and transform knowledge and instruction.
<p>
<B>Implementation Plan</B>
<br>
The Mobile Media Center technology will be easily integrated into existing
journalism, photography and video filming classes to enhance learning and
facilitate communication throughout the entire campus.</font>

<p>
</center>

The objective of my "Win with Proxima" plan is to improve the communication
and problem solving skills of fifth and sixth grade language arts students. I will use a digital camera, computer and Proxima projector to improve writing skills, to create a class journal for historical and demonstration purposes, and to motivate students to communicate more effectively. Photographs of students, sites and situations will be displayed via our Proxima Desktop Projector. They can be cropped, enhanced or even shown in cartoon form. Student responses to the photographs will be typed in, revised and group edited. Pictures can be shown to an entire class, and text will be seen almost as soon as it is spoken. No more waiting for responses to be written on the chalkboard! It will create writing prompts which will motivate visual, oral and written communication. Each day's journal entry can be stored for further revision after students have had time for reflection. It will eventually be printed and bound into book form with our spiral binding machine for placement in our school media center. The combination of digital camera and Proxima media center will create a positive learning environment.
<p>
The effectiveness of the program will be assessed by teacher-directed writing samples using a teacher-made rubric to measure: (1) responding to a
writing prompt, (2) using a variety of descriptive language, (3) using standard grammar, mechanics and spelling, and (4) expressing individual ideas. A pretest and posttest will be given. It will also be evaluated by a student opinion survey and by the final product of the class journal.</font>

As Milton Glick pointed out in his article in EduCom Review, "Everything we
are used to -- books, lectures, television -- is one-way, focused on what the teacher, writer or actor does. It is hard for us to remember that it is not what the teacher does but what he or she gets students to do that results in learning." (Glick, 1990)
<p>
For this reason, "interactive computing ... a new teaching medium, combining visual values of television and instructional ideas," (Hale, 1989) needs to take its place in the classroom. This proposal accepts Hale's challenge and will attempt to provide classroom instruction in English/Language Arts which promotes collaborative teaching-learning through technology.
<p>
<B>Educational Objective</B>
<br>
The objective of this proposal is to successfully involve students with
curricular material in an active, rather than passive mode. Using desktop
projectors, computer applications and audio/video sources, students will
manipulate and apply their knowledge through reading, writing and speaking
activities.
<p>
<B>Impact on Learning</B>
<br>
Students will be able to:
<menu>
* Read and discuss on-screen examples of selected literature.<br>
* Search out and experience a Web site about an author or identified literary theme.<br>
* Research, collect and organize on- or off-line material for presentation
to the class.<br>
* Reach out, through Internet connection, to other students or adults for
research and/or presentation of project ideas. Project assignments will be
shared with others on the school's Web home page.<br>
* Practice reading, composition and speaking skills as literary themes and
related projects are developed.<br>
* Work together or individually, as needed, with teacher input to develop
inquiry, critical thinking and problem-solving strategies.
</menu>
<p>
<B>Evaluation of Effectiveness</B>
<br>
Several evaluation techniques will be used to assess the effectiveness of the "interactive technology" approach. Student assessment portfolios on disk or video tape of unit projects and themes will allow teachers and parents to review the results of appropriate skill applications related to reading, writing and speaking. Peer review will be incorporated into the unit's assessment model. Students share their information with others in the class who may be working on a related aspect of the unit and eventually bring together all phases of the study in a large group setting. Evaluation and assessment is an ongoing process which will adjust as teacher and student find new ways of interacting with the technology.

</center>

I teach special education at Shippensburg Area Junior High School in
Shippensburg, Pennsylvania. My students are enrolled in seventh, eighth and
ninth grades. In our school district, we are beginning to include special
education students in many regular education classes. That means all
teachers must learn to teach these special students as well as students who
learn more rapidly and who can work with less guidance.
<p>
More so than other students, special education students learn aurally -- by
seeing and hearing. Seeing visuals on a Proxima desktop projector will
enable these students to keep up with the other students in the "included"
classes. A lesson prepared for special education students can then be used
in each of the classes in which such students are included. Also, having
the lesson visuals in a computer will enable any teacher to replay the
lesson visuals for the special students in his or her classes.
<p>
One can predict that each classroom in our school will eventually include a
Mobile Media Center. That would be revolutionary in our district since few
rooms are now equipped that way. Moreover, sharing lessons among special
education students and others would move learning to a higher dimension,
since materials on disks could be copied and used in many classes by many
teachers and students.
<p>
A specific area the Proxima desktop projector would enhance would be
reading and language development. Most of the Learning Support students I
teach have a disability in the area of language development. "Reading
workshop" and the "writing process" are two teaching strategies used in
education today. Students would be able to share published writing with the
class via the Proxima/computer visuals. This format would be acceptable for
all levels of students. It would be possible to peer edit a student's
writing so everyone could participate, even those students with limited
language skills. Students with learning disabilities want to be able to
show their talents in the same manner as non-disabled students, and the
Proxima desktop projector could provide them with this opportunity.
<p>
Also, having a center or a projector would enable special education
students to read the same material together. Few trade books are available
in sufficient quantities for each student. But a group of students or an
entire class could read a Proxima visual projected from a novel or an
encyclopedia stored on a CD-ROM. When more than 200 classrooms and more
than 1,200 individual classes function in this way each day, education in
rural Shippensburg will be revolutionized.</font>

<p>
</center>

<B>Educational Objective:</B>
<br>
The student will view the process of writing a proper expository paragraph from its inception and brainstorming stages, through its revision, editing and proofreading stages, to the final copy. Then the student will write one him/herself by duplicating the process just observed. This will be completed by observing an incident in the classroom, discussing it, and then instantly watching ideas and sentences be developed and revised into a proper paragraph. This 1) gives immediate feedback to the students, and 2) addresses students with all models of learning styles including auditory, visual and tactile, allowing them to learn by seeing, hearing and doing -- all essentially important components to acquiring knowledge for the adult developmental student.
<p>
<B>Implementation Plan:</B>
<br>
1. The instructor will precede this particular instruction with an assignment of reading various paragraph models in the textbook. Ideally, this would have involved a discussion of the topic sentence, subtopic sentences, supporting details and finally the concluding sentence -- all parts of the well-written paragraph.
<p>
2. The instructor will use the Proxima DP2400 Desktop Projector to
illustrate the actual development of the paragraph in the classroom in the
following manner:
<menu>
a. The instructor will have someone come into the classroom, wearing an
outlandish outfit; a large straw hat adorned with daisies; perhaps clown
shoes; garish make-up including bright blue eye shadow, red lipstick and
bright red cheeks; old-out-of-date dress with "stuffed" bosom; carrying
accessories such as an umbrella, calculator, stuffed animal and a classroom
textbook. The dressed-up student will make a "noisy" entrance, perhaps
knocking on the door first and then falling over a chair inside the room.
Once the student sits down, he/she should make a grand announcement that
he/she is in the wrong room and quickly speed out. The remaining students'
task then is to write an illustrative paragraph, describing what just
occurred.<br>
b. A student should be asked to give a topic sentence about the event that
just occurred. The instructor will type it onto the computer so it may be
viewed on the overhead.<br>
c. Another student should be asked to give three main subtopic sentences,
describing the event. As they are dictated, the instructor also types them
into the computer so that they may be projected on the screen.
</menu>
3. After the outline is complete, the student should offer details that
could be inserted after the subtopic sentences to lend support. These
should be typed in as they are dictated.
<p>
4. This process should continue with the entire paragraph until a rough
draft of the paragraph is completed. The draft should be viewed together as
a class and then discussed as to what sentences might be "polished" and
how. The revisions can be made directly on the paragraph as the students
offer suggestions. The instructor should do this with the complete
paragraph.
<p>
5. The instructor will then have the students look for grammar errors.
Students offer suggestions for any corrections that they might see and the
instructor makes them as they are discussed so that the class can see them.
<p>
6. After all the revisions are completed, the students proofread. At this
time, the instructor might also demonstrate how the computer can
spell-check the paragraph. The instructor might also demonstrate how to use
other tools such as the thesaurus.
<p>
7. Finally, the instructor will discuss and review the steps in writing
that the students just demonstrated on this exercise.
<p>
8. They would then follow this exercise by composing their own paragraphs
by using the same steps and procedures that they just observed on the
overhead.</font>

To share the computerized lesson plans with students, instructors simply connect a lap-top computer to Proxima's 2800 desktop projector and "viola!". . . the information on the computer screen is projected onto a large movie screen for all to view.
<p>
"This multimedia capability allows teachers in various disciplines to add   
a personal touch to information presented to students," said Barbara Braeunig, media director for the college.  "Instructors are able to deliver much more creative lesson plans."
<p>
According to Braeunig, PBCC teachers have reported that students are paying more attention in class.  "A visually stimulating program gets the concept across better than verbalizing alone," she said.  "Because it also offers more interactivity, students have developed an increased understanding of coursework.  Generally speaking, students are doing better in class."
<p>
The college currently owns two Proxima systems, each situated on a portable cart with a lap-top computer complete with CD-ROM and sound, and video cassette/laser disc players.  "The portability of the Proxima's allows more instructors to utilize the systems," Braeunig said.
<p>
Word is spreading fast around South Campus.  The college's two Proxima's are in use 80 percent of the school day with a steadily increasing demand by teachers.  "More and more instructors want to utilize this technology in their classrooms," Braeunig said.  "We plan to maximize use of the existing systems and add more as the budget allows."</td>

		<td valign = top><font size = "+1">On January 29, 1996, the University of the South unveiled its new, fully-equipped, 20x40' electronic classroom, a highlight of which are two ceiling-mounted Proxima <A HREF="../../New/newdp5500.html">Desktop Projector<sup><font size = "-2">TM</font></sup> 5100s</A> directed at one of two 10x10 projection screens.  Only state-of-the-art desktop projection technology such as the DP5100 would allow this cutting-edge presentation room to fully maximize its investment in technologies such as computers, on-line information, VCRs, and laser discs.
<p>
"The clarity is unbelievable," said Susan McBee, Assistant Director of Academic Computing for the University.  "You can sit anywhere in the room   
and view a crisp, clean image that is much more visible than the traditional projector and theater-size screen we have in our auditorium."
<p>
Using both Proxima Desktop Projectors at once is also a popular idea at the University.  "An instructor can display a Web page from the computer on one screen while using a VCR to show a video on the other."  The combination allows endless instructional opportunities.
<p>
According to McBee, an overwhelming demand for the use of the Proxima equipment has prompted plans for more "electronic classrooms" around the   
campus.</td>

I propose to use the Proxima Desktop Projector 2750 to enhance the unit on
mitosis. The objectives for my Applied Biology classes would be to describe
all five phases of mitosis and the duplication of chromosomes.
<p>
The Proxima Desktop Projector 2750 would be used to display the computer
program on cell division. The projector would allow the students to see the
duplication of chromosomes and the whole mitosis process at the same time.
This would facilitate class discussion and explanation as the students view
the program together. The time lapse photomicrography would enable the
students to actually see the process. Without the use of this multimedia
program the students would be limited to still pictures of the process.
<p>
The class will make models of the process on the computer using the paint
brush program. In groups, the students will create transparencies of the
process and give a description of the process to the class.
<p>
The students would be evaluated in two ways. First, the students will give a
written and pictorial description of the mitosis process. Second, the
students will use the projector to explain the process to the class, as it
occurs on the projection screen. Both of these objectives will be done with
85 percent accuracy.</font>

<font color = "CF0000"><B>Using Internet Sites in Teaching World Geography</B></font>
<p>
</center>

We propose to revise the present grade six geography course to use Internet
sites and multimedia production as the main learning tools. Perhaps more than any other subject, social studies can directly use the Internet as a teaching and learning tool. On the second page to this entry is a very partial list of sites which contain information about geography and culture.
<p>
Mr. Bicher and Mr. Krall will co-teach grade six students in the social studies course, "World Cultures/World Geography." Mr. Krall's classroom will have only chairs and computers. He will guide the students in creating multimedia productions using the presently-owned Macintosh computers - three 5200LC/75s, one LCIII, one LCII, and one 475. These computers will be situated in six semi-private pods with a multimedia program and learning objective at each. Children will work in cooperative learning groups of four to six students each. Each pod will have Internet access and Flash-it software, along with either ClarisWorks Slide Show, HyperStudio or Digital Chisel. One pod will have the option of Amazing Animation, a simpler multimedia production program. A scanner will be available in the lab next to the classroom. All hardware and software is already owned by the school or participating teachers. Video capture capabilities will be provided, if needed.
<p>
The large group projection capabilities will be used in Mr. Bicher's classroom. Mr. Bicher will use bookmarked Internet sites to introduce regions and countries, to supplement student presentations, and to summarize information. A combination of country home pages, travel directories, educational sites, and home pages of cities, businesses and individuals which offer graphics and/or information will create a well-rounded presentation. The presentations will remain dynamic and current as sites are added and updated.
<p>
Mr. Krall and Mr. Bicher will be given schedules which coincide, so that 58
children and two teachers can combine and exchange classes at will. Student
presentations will be made to combined classes as often as possible to
increase their value and to allow students to learn from one another.
<p>
Multimedia projects will be evaluated on content as well as the meeting of
objectives. Projects will also be followed by a self-evaluation and a
written summary. Standard tests will be given following whole group
presentations. It is believed that the skills, understanding and measurable
knowledge will equal or exceed that of a traditional class. Student
involvement will greatly improve.
<p>
<B>Benefits:</B>
<br>
1. This information is constantly updated, often multimedia, and free. A number of sites will add information or graphics when requested to do so. An aggressive teacher can actually create a geography resource which will far outweigh any textbook and rival most school information centers.
<p>
2. Outstanding projects by students can become part of the instructional milieu. As student skills progress, multimedia programs can be used to access Internet sites, allowing sites to become part of the multimedia report.
<p>
3. The six pods will be used constantly, as will be the projection system.
Without the co-teaching, each type of technology would rest while the other
was being used.
<p>
4. Mr. Krall, as part-time Learning and Technology Coordinator, will have
more freedom to attend to his duties. While he will remain a social studies
teacher, his educational direction will be technology. This project will
also be an excellent example of the marriage of learning and technology.

<p>
</center>

The title of my proposed program is "Newton's Laws Revealed in Real-Time."
During this program, students will design experiments to investigate various concepts of motion; implement them; and collect, analyze and display their data. The students will be able to describe Newton's Laws and the effects of friction when finished with this program. The students will also develop skills in cooperation, communication and the use of technology.
<p>
To begin this program, have a toy car at the top of a ramp displayed at the
front of the room and the students in cooperative groups of three or four.
<p>
Lead a discussion about what the car would do if you just left it alone and if you gave it a push. Tell the students that this tendency of an object at rest to stay at rest and if in motion to stay in motion is called "inertia" and that there are many variables that affect it. Then have the groups brainstorm all the variables they can think of that might affect the car/ramp setup. Their lists might include the mass of the car, the shape of the car, the height of the ramp, etc. These can be listed on a chart for everyone to contemplate.
<p>
Then, with teacher guidance, have each group choose a variable they are interested in investigating, change it into a question (Does the height of the ramp affect the speed of the car? Which is faster, a car with greater or lesser mass?), and design an experiment that includes the use of appropriate computer sensors. Each group would be responsible for a different investigation and would need to be prepared to actually do the experiment in front of the class with the appropriate computer sensors. The computer would automatically graph the data as the experiment progresses and this would be displayed on a screen by a Proxima Desktop Projector for the whole class to see. The group in charge of the experiment would then lead a discussion with the rest of the class as to what conclusions could be drawn from the data. When a consensus is reached, the conclusion would be recorded by all and the next group would present.
<p>
This program allows students, with the help of technology, to become
facilitators of their own learning. They feel more in charge and thus become more excited about learning. The use of the Proxima Desktop Projector in conjunction with my computer equipped with sensors and EasyLog software allows all the students to participate in the investigations. This is a great improvement over the past when groups had to wait their turn at the computer and then spend an inordinate amount of time making displays so they could explain their investigation and conclusions to the rest of the
class. Using the Proxima Desktop Projector gets rid of the busywork and
allows the students to concentrate on the data analysis -- what can be
learned from this experiment? The Proxima Desktop Projector allows the
whole class to become involved and puts the "Real-Time" in Newton's Laws.</font>

<B>Educational Objectives</B>
<br>
* Engage students, especially deaf students, in active learning that is
stimulating, encouraging and self-motivating through the use of desktop
projection products and other technologies.<br>
* Give deaf students Access to spoken language through visual input.<br>
* Encourage and instruct teachers in the use of new technologies in the
classroom.<br>
<p>
<B>Population</B>
<br>
* Deaf students attending mainstream classes.<br>
* Hearing students involved with and in deaf students' classes.<br>
* Teachers and administrators in schools where deaf children are mainstreamed.<br>
* Parents.<br>
* Community organizations seeking presentations about deafness and
educational opportunities.
<p>
<B>Implementation</B>
<br>
* Project teacher instruction and lectures visually for not only the hearing impaired students, but all students in the class to increase comprehension and understanding of teacher language and instructions.<br>
* With the use of a laptop, type and project spoken information during school assemblies and all-school events that can often times be limiting to deaf students.<br>
* Allow large groups of students to work as a team to create multimedia presentations from curriculum content using authoring software such as Hyperstudio, Kid Pix Studio and HyperCard, and hardware such as scanners,
video cameras and digital photography.<br>
* Develop personal portfolios to include work accomplished, grades, interests, hobbies and other student information. Utilize many technologies
to input student work: scanning equipment, digital cameras and video clips.<br>
* Through use of such technologies, gain basic knowledge of the parts,
function and use of computer technology.<br>
* Give inservice instruction to teachers who work with deaf children to
educate them on deafness and modifications that can be beneficial to deaf
students, and to demonstrate the power of multimedia and the impact of
visual information in material retention.<br>
* Assist teachers in the use of new computer equipment, including
projection equipment, through demonstration, inservice, team teaching and
hands-on use.<br>
* Hold Saturday Tech Academy for Parents two to four times a year to share
programs and projects with parents, and to help them experience producing a
product of their own.<br>
* Use student-made presentations, Interactive Student Portfolios and
inservice materials to make presentations to community-based organizations
to share how education is welcoming and utilizing advanced technologies.
<p>
<B>Evaluation</B>
<br>
* Administer a questionnaire prior to implementation to participants.
Questions will pertain to knowledge and attitude toward technology. Student
will discuss attitudes about school and learning; teachers will discuss
attitudes and use of current technology. At the end of period, administer
the same questionnaire to examine attitudinal changes and changes in
teacher use of various equipment.<br>
* Compile and evaluate students' electronic portfolios, and use for
presentations to parents and community organizations.<br>
* Survey parents on their current level of computer competency at the start
of program. Later, request feedback on the effectiveness of the program.
<p>
Phase I of Access was a proposal that included purchase of specific
computer hardware. This proposal went into effect in April 1996. The school
was able to purchase a multimedia computer, scanner, digital camera and
color printer. The students have been learning terms, and basic functions
of the Macintosh, and how to create documents. Phase II is this Proxima
Proposal, and would help to expand the number of students and teachers who
could benefit and interact with already purchased equipment, and further
the purpose of Access for students and their needs.</font>

<p>
</center>

<B>Educational Objectives:</B>
<br>
a) To provide real-world learning experiences by connecting students to their community, and b) to allow students to contribute to their community through research and collaboration via ongoing presentations in the school as well as in the community.
<p>
School Background and Implementation Support: Minter Bridge operates within
a framework called the "School- Wide Enrichment Model" (SEM) which successfully demonstrates that students learn best when engaged in enriching and "real-world" activities. A full-time School-Wide Enrichment Specialist works with all students and staff to facilitate just these kinds of experiences, working in small groups and whole classes, K-6. At Minter Bridge, the SEM Specialist is also the Technology Facilitator who provides
leadership, training, and instruction in current and creative uses of technology. This position is unique due to its flexibility and ideal for facilitating this school-wide project. This project is consistent with the kinds of experiences enthusiastically supported by both staff and administration.
<p>
<B>General Project Description:</B>
<br>
The future will require many different kinds of abilities that responsible
educators must begin to integrate. Three important abilities that are difficult to learn and practice within the confines of a school setting include collaborating with the community, being aware of and involved in local issues, and truly contributing formally to that community through research, study and oral presentations.
<p>
The idea of this project is to take issues of genuine community and student
concern, collaborate with local organizations, develop target areas for student contribution, develop research processes using multiple technologies (such as the Internet, CD-ROM, PDAs) and then present the findings to the community using presentation tools! Multiple groups of students would be working both on conducting research and presenting to the impacted community members, as well as practicing their presentations in school to their peers. Student Research Teams and their "Multi-Media Electronic Newsletters" would become important contributors to the city, showcasing what students are capable of, as well as the impact of meaningful technology on student learning and motivation.
<p>
Imagine a fifth/sixth grade student group collaborating with the local fire
department, who has asked for data on families' safety plans. Students then
use the World Wide Web (present in our school) to collect data via telephone/fax/Internet forms and personal contacts. Students summarize their findings and present them to various groups including the fire department, chamber of commerce, a community safety board, and the mayor. As a result, a plan is implemented by the fire department to better educate families about the importance of safety plans!
<p>
Word circulates about the value of asking students for help. The Parks and
Recreation Department asks a third/fourth grade student group to collect
data on how families use parks to help in the development of a new community park. Students present to multiple community groups and share
findings that impact the plan and save the park department money, as well
as serve the children of their community.
<p>
An architecture firm wants research done on local housing styles to contribute to a national study on historic preservation. Students create a
multimedia presentation highlighting local styles along with examples.
<p>
When kids are empowered, their concerns become motivation for further study
and presentations -- from bat preservation to baseball fields, from rainfall to rain forests. Consider for just a moment the potential for student growth. The result of important work is impressive learning! 
<p>
Young students need genuine work. They want to learn about things they can
connect to -- that impact them. The skills and abilities that would result
from this kind of learning are obvious and exciting. Aside from the basic skills we teach such as reading and writing, we will develop students who
can set goals and reach them, meet deadlines, and follow a project to its
conclusion. Students understand the value of research and thinking, summarizing findings, making decisions, and working on a team.
<p>
Most important, we have empowered students to stand up and speak to an
audience about topics they care about, confidently and convincingly -- one of industry's highest rated skills.
<p>
The evaluation piece of this project is in its real-work scenarios. If students' research is incomplete or conclusions are misguided, their partners in the community will be on-hand to point out errors or misunderstandings. Students will care about the quality of their work since it must be shared with people who need accurate conclusions. In addition, evaluation of all special projects is conducted through an ongoing and thorough Collaborative Action Research process, supervised by the schools' Site Council and district administration.
<p>
Minter Bridge employs the technologies mentioned in the above plan, except
for the projection device and laptop. We use a variety of applications with
students including ClarisWorks, HyperCard, HyperStudio and PowerPoint; and
use Netscape and various smaller programs for work on the Web. A Technology
Team convenes regularly to determine the best practices and to upgrade our
equipment. All students have supervised access to the Internet, and can work on both Apple/Mac and PC platforms.
<p>
Minter Bridge also maintains an extensive community home page.
<p>
More than ever, educators and students have to push themselves to become
real leaders in a changing world if we are to be active participants instead of passive recipients and indifferent observers. The Proxima presentation tool would empower our students to become genuine contributors.</font>

		<td valign = top><font size = "+1">In the early 1900s students used slates and chalk to complete their school work; a few years later they began using pen and paper.  Today, in Hory County, South Carolina, more than 26,000 students are giving classroom reports via multimedia presentations using Proxima Ovation<sup><font size = "-1">&#174</font></sup> LCD panels.
<p>
"Students now have the knowledge of how to use technology and a better   
appreciation of real world conditions," said Richard Nadeau, Hory County Schools' Director of Technology.  "We realize that in the future classrooms will not be complete without multimedia technology.  We will continue to take advantage of new ways to use it."
<p>
<A HREF="../../New/newova944.html">Proxima Ovation LCD panels</A> have been in use at Hory County's 36 elementary, middle and high schools for nearly two years as part of a wider technology plan.  All of the schools are on-line with the Internet, and through the LCD panels teachers are able to share computer information with whole classrooms versus one or two students at a time.
<p>
The projection equipment was also used during a recent presentation to the School Board on the district's technology plan, giving board members a vivid demonstration of just how beneficial the technology really is.</td>

<B>Room Lighting</B>
<p>
The Illuminating Engineering Society of North America (IESNA) established a procedure in 1979 for selecting illuminances (lighting) for virtually any type of room or area, based upon facts important to visual performance. The IESNA standards provide minimum, optimum, and maximum recommended illuminance levels for various categories (types of spaces to be illuminated). 
<p>
The procedure is flexible enough to allow a lighting designer to tailor the lighting to a specific set of conditions; this same "tailoring" makes it difficult for you to know ahead of time exactly how much light is in a room. If you do not have a projector that puts enough light on the screen in a fully lit meeting room, you must adjust the lights. In many environments, even 300 ANSI lumens will not overcome the light interference.
<p>
You probably give presentations in areas defined in the IESNA illuminance categories C and D. A sampling of categories that address room lighting where presentations usually occur follows:
<p>

</table>
<p>
The figures above consider primarily man-made sources of lighting. The lighting that affects your presentation actually consists of more than just man-made sources, and can be broken up into two controllable categories (artificial and natural) and one uncontrollable category (ambient).
Artificial light is the man-made light that you can control; fluorescent, incandescent, metal halide, quartz halogen, etc. In many presentation settings, lighting conditions can be controlled to varying degrees. Lights on dimmers, supplementary indirect lighting, and split circuits so lights can be individually or group controlled are a few of the lighting schemes you may encounter. Avoid having incandescent light shining directly on or behind the projection screen.
<p>
Natural light is anything other than man-made light; it can only be controlled by blocking or filtering it out. Even if you have a very bright projection system, try to eliminate direct sunlight on or behind the screen or in the room. As the sun moves across the sky, shadows move in the room and hot spots occur that are distracting and sometimes uncomfortable to your audience.
<p>
Ambient light is existing light in your presentation environment that you can not control. It can consist of natural, artificial or a combination of both types of light. Ambient lighting that can not be removed by turning off artificial lights or pulling the blinds can make your presentation most difficult. People have been searching for and finding innovative ways to eliminate ambient lighting for years.
<p>
Consider trying to make a presentation with a sub-300 ANSI lumen projection device in a tradeshow environment: a huge hall with metal halide lamps directly overhead. A image large enough for people 50 feet away to see will be washed out if you can't block ambient light with at least a roof directly over the projection area. It makes for less than a forceful presentation.

			</table>
<p>
<B>Image Brightness</B>
<p>
Given all the viewing distance, image height, character size, and lighting variables, it's possible to figure out how bright a projector you need. Let's assume that most areas where you give presentations are in the middle of the illuminance range for their category (category C is 15 footcandles; category D is 30 footcandles). If you project 300 ANSI lumens on the screen in a 3 x 4 foot image, brightness on the screen in footcandles can be calculated as follows:
<p>

<center>
ANSI lumens / Square footage of Screen  =  Footcandles on an Image<br>
			<table>
				<tr>
					<td valign = center><font size = +1>300 / </td>
					<td valign = center><IMG SRC="gifs/science8.gif" width = 106 height = 86> </td>
					<td valign = center><font size = +1>=  25 footcandles</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
</center>

<p>
			<table width = 549>
				<tr>
					<td valign = top><font size = +1>R</font>ULE&#160<font size = +1>O</font>F&#160<font size = +1>T</font>HUMB: </td>
					<td valign = top><B>FOOTCANDLES ON THE SCREEN:</B> </td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td></td>
					<td>ANSI LUMENS  /  SCREEN AREA  =  FOOTCANDLES</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
<p>
Because ambient light on a wall or screen is typically 1/2 of the ambient light on a desktop or working surface (unless there is a light directly over the screen area) a general rule of thumb is to project three times the amount of footcandles on the screen as 1/2 of the ambient light in the room. Therefore, a 300 ANSI lumen projector will operate fairly well in most exhibition halls and auditoriums (providing the image is no larger than 3 x 4 feet).
<p>
			<table width = 549>
				<tr>
					<td valign = top><font size = +1>R</font>ULE&#160<font size = +1>O</font>F&#160<font size = +1>T</font>HUMB: </td>
					<td valign = top align = right><B>MINIMUM IMAGE BRIGHTNESS:</B></td>
					<td>= 3  X  (AMBIENT LIGHTING  /  2)</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
<p>
If the size of the image is increased to twice the size, you can see that image size significantly affects the brightness of the image.

<H1><CENTER>What is<BR>
&quot;Humane Sustainable Culture&quot;?</CENTER>
</H1>
AS A VISION AND IDEAL it is really very simple. Here are some quick definitions:
<UL>
  <LI>A good life for all life that can be passed on to everyone's great,
great ... grandchildren 
  <LI>A culture (or society) that is meaningful and satisfying to its members
today and that does not need to destroy or deplete its environment in order
to be that way. 
</UL>
Yet as simple and almost universally appealing as this vision is,
<UL>
  <LI>our present global society is, by these definitions, neither humane
nor sustainable 
  <LI>there is no broad understanding or consensus on how to get from where
we are to a humane and sustainable way of life. 
</UL>
Context Institute exists to help bridge this gap and has the mission to
&quot;serve as an effective catalyst for signficant cultural change toward
a humane and sustainable world.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
When we began our work in 1979, few people thought in terms of &quot;sustainability,&quot;
much less &quot;humane sustainable culture.&quot; Today the concept of &quot;sustainable
development&quot; has become commonplace in the policy discussions of international
bodies like the <A HREF="http://www.un.org/">UN</A> and many national governments
(e.g. <A HREF="http://www.rri.org/gpnats.html">National Green Plans</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.whitehouse.gov/WH/EOP/pcsd/index.html">President's Council
on Sustainable Development</A>, US Dept of Energy's <A HREF="http://www.sustainable.doe.gov/">Center
For Excellence in Sustainable Development</A> [headed by <A HREF="../IC01/Becker.htm">William
Becker</A>, one of the authors in the first issue of <I>IN CONTEXT</I>]).
Yet there remains much to be done. We intend to keep &quot;pushing the envelope&quot;
and exploring the growing edge of what, over the next few decades, just
could be the worldwide emergence of a humane and sustainable future.<BR>
<BR>
For more on how we approach &quot;humane sustainable culture,&quot; &quot;sustainability,&quot;
&quot;sustainable development,&quot; and &quot;the sustainability movement,&quot;

<P>Since its founding in 1979 by <A HREF="../../PEOPLE/RCGBio.htm">Robert</A>
and <A HREF="../../PEOPLE/DAGBio.htm">Diane</A> Gilman, CONTEXT INSTITUTE
has explored how human society can become sustainable (i.e. able to meet
the needs of the present without diminishing the prospects for the future),
and has served as a catalyst for voluntary change toward a more <A HREF=
"../../ICLIB/DEFS/hsc.htm">humane and sustainable culture</A>. We are one
of a handful of organizations that have focused on sustainability as a central
theme for more than a decade, and we are now internationally recognized
as an authority in this area.<BR>
<BR>
We are best known for our journal, <A HREF="../../ICLIB/icintro.htm"><EM>IN
CONTEXT: A Quarterly of Humane Sustainable Culture</EM>.</A> in print from
1983 to 1995 and now <A HREF="../../ICLIB/backi.htm">continuing</A> on this
site. We are also involved in a variety of <A HREF="cibooks.htm">other publishing</A>
and <A HREF="consult.htm">collaboration &amp; consulting</A> programs.<BR>
<BR>
The Institute, an independent non-profit (501(c)(3)) organization, was initially
a local living-lightly organization. In 1983, we began our quarterly journal
and broadened our focus. In the succeeding years, Institute staff have published,
spoken, and consulted in such diverse areas as community development, cultural
history and cultural change, systems thinking, education, ecological living,
sustainable economics, and the built environment.<BR>
<BR>
Central to our approach is our sense that the world is now going through
a process of cultural change that is as profound as the shift, over 5000
years ago, out of hunting and gathering and into agriculture and cities.
We refer to that previous shift as going from the Tribal Era to the Empire
Era. We see ourselves as now in the transition between the Empire Era and
the Planetary Era. (For more detail on this perspective, see <A HREF="../../ICLIB/IC36/Gilman1.htm">&quot;What
Time Is It?&quot;</A>.)<BR>
<BR>
We recognize the great dangers of our times, yet, because the underlying
momentum of change is so great, we also see these as times of great opportunity
to develop humane and sustainable cultures for the Planetary Era, cultures
that could provide a quality of life for all that would make today's societies
look like the dark ages. It is this positive vision of the possible, together
with a keen awareness that time is running out, that motivates our work.<BR>
<BR>
While we address some of the same issues as those addressed by environmental,
political, social-action, and personal-growth organizations, our approach
is different. As much as possible, we approach these issues from the context
of the emerging Planetary Era, rather than within the context of the waning
Empire Era. This leads us to focus on <I>yes</I> rather than <I>no</I>,
on <I>voluntary human-scale innovation</I>, and to integrate the full gamut
of human concerns environmental, social, economic, personal into a long-term,
whole-system, constructive perspective.<BR>
<BR>
Much of the Institute's work focuses on encouraging the sustainable redevelopment
of the industrialized world (i.e. the rich countries of the North plus their
many cultural extensions throughout the world). We focus here because we
feel that most of the world's unsustainable practices have their roots in
these globally dominant societies. Any real solutions must address, and
help to transform, this cultural core. Indeed, we feel that such sustainable
redevelopment, with all the profound cultural change that will entail, is
<EM>the </EM>central challenge and task facing the industrialized world,
and humanity, during the coming decades.<BR>
<BR>
The organization directs its work towards those who are willing and able
to help move their organizations, their communities, their personal lives,
and their societies in a more humane and sustainable direction. We think
of these people as cultural leaders, some of whom are in positions of institutional
power, and others who are simply influential through their own initiative
and sensitivity. We focus on these early adopters because experience shows
that the most effective way to promote lasting cultural change is to educate
and empower cultural leaders who then influence the rest of society. <BR>
<BR>
We assist these cultural leaders through a variety of programs which enable
them to discover:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>a whole-system understanding of the new human <EM><STRONG>context </STRONG></EM>at
  the dawn of the 21st century
  <LI>practical, experience-based <EM><STRONG>approaches </STRONG></EM>to
  the perplexing issues of our times consistent with this emerging context
  <LI><EM><STRONG>strategies </STRONG></EM>and <EM><STRONG>skills </STRONG></EM>for
  effective change
  <LI>realistic <EM><STRONG>vision</STRONG>, <STRONG>hope </STRONG></EM>and
  <EM><STRONG>empowerment</STRONG></EM>
</UL>

<P><BR>
In addition to expertise in particular topic areas, our work is characterized
by a way of thinking which we feel is important for the development of humane
sustainable cultures appropriate for the Planetary Era. While there is no
simple name or description for this way of thinking, it includes the following
elements:<BR>
<BR>
<EM><STRONG>Systems Thinking</STRONG></EM> - We draw on our background in
systems theory to ask and help those we serve to ask: How do the pieces
in the puzzle fit together? What's going on beneath the surface? What are
the significant feedback loops that tie a system together? What are its
dynamics in time? At what points in a system can change most fruitfully
be introduced?<BR>
<BR>
<EM><STRONG>Solution Orientation </STRONG></EM>- We start where many others
leave off: with a vision of a preferred future (humane and sustainable)
and a critical awareness of the problems of the present. With this as our
starting point, we see our <EM>primary</EM> task as searching for those
constructive, experience-based, promising solutions and approaches that
could provide a path from today's problems to that preferred future. While
others provide the necessary &quot;no&quot; to the dysfunctions of business-as-usual,
we focus on providing the necessary &quot;yes&quot; that provides a viable
and desirable alternative.<BR>
<BR>
<EM><STRONG>Ecological Thinking</STRONG></EM> - Our ability to survive as
a species requires an understanding of human interdependence with each other
and with all life and a recognition that we must find solutions that work
for the whole. The ecological system is both the basic reality in which
we need to function and a fruitful metaphor for more sustainable human systems,
such as production systems in which the wastes from one process become resources
for another.<BR>
<BR>
<EM><STRONG>Long-Term Orientation</STRONG></EM> - A deep sense of history,
going back thousands, millions and even billions of years, helps us to more
richly understand the character and possibilities of cultural evolution.
A long-term commitment to many generations into the future provides the
moral foundation for the basic principles of sustainability. Taken together,
they enable us to focus on essentials and avoid being distracted by the
fads and short-term news of the day.<BR>
<BR>
<EM><STRONG>Compassion and Forgiveness</STRONG></EM> - We are all in this
together. We are all a part of, and to varying degrees collude with, the
unsustainable systems in which we are embedded ... <I>and</I> we all have
something to contribute toward a positive future. Context Institute is committed
to a clear-eyed understanding of the problems of today, but we are not motivated
by an interest in finding individuals or groups to blame. We work instead
to remind ourselves and each other of that more spacious spirit in which
compassion and forgiveness are natural responses, and healing is the natural
result.<BR>
<BR>
By applying this way of thinking to a wide variety of social, cultural,
and ecological issues, we have helped with the building of vision for a
sustainable future among a small but influential group of opinion leaders
and innovators. We intend to continue to extend the range of people involved
in exploring these issues and building this vision. <BR>

  <P><A HREF="../GROUPS/CI/ci.htm">Context Institute</A> published this journal
  from 1983 through 1995. In January 1996, CI decided to move <CITE>IN CONTEXT</CITE>
  from print to the web. Over the coming months we will make material from
  <A HREF="backi.htm">IC back issues</A> available through this site and
  we will continue to add similar material into an ever growing IC library.
  Here's an overview of IC in its print phase:</P>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER><HR WIDTH="30%"></P>
  <P><I>IN CONTEXT</I>'s whole-system and solution-oriented approach is essentially
  unique. The journal explores and clarifies what humane sustainable culture
  is and provides information, hope, and inspiration supportive of fundamental
  cultural change. Each issue offers a series of articles and inter- views,
  from contributors around the world, integrated around a central theme.
  Subjects have included sustainable habitat, the family, citizen diplomacy,
  education, political participation, and strategies for cultural transformation
  - always integrating the societal and the environmental, and keeping a
  strong focus on demonstrated solutions. (For more detail, see <A HREF=
  "backi.htm">IC back issues</A> .)<BR>
  <BR>
  Recent authors and interviewees include Al Gore, Lt. General Henry Hatch,
  Amory Lovins, Bill Moyers, Theodore Roszak, and dozens of others who are
  equally interesting but simply less well known. Contributing Editors include
  David Korten, Donella Meadows, William Prescott , and Vicki Robin.<BR>
  <BR>
  In 1991, and again in 1994, <I>IN CONTEXT</I> won the <CITE>Utne Reader's</CITE>
  Alternative Press Award for &quot;Best Coverage of Emerging Issues.&quot;
  It continues to receive high praise from readers, reviewers, and leaders
  in the field: </P>

In May visionary architect Tom Bender sent me &quot;Eco-Building II,&quot;
but without its present footnotes and references. I really liked it, yet
I also felt what Tom was saying was too important to be unreferenced. When
I found that Tom could supply much of the supporting evidence through his
own other writings, it occured to me, &quot;Why not do a whole group of
Tom's articles with &quot;Eco-Building II&quot; as the lead linked to all
the rest.&quot; I hope you will enjoy the result.

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>The Great Transition of '96</H1>

<P><BR>
Wondering why <I>IN CONTEXT</I> is no longer in print? Here's the story
...</P>

<P>The period between November 1995 and September 1996 has been the most
tumultuous in Context Institute's 17 year history. During that period we've:
</P>

<UL>
  <LI>had a sever financial crisis </LI>
  <LI>been engrossed in an long conflict over Context Institute (CI) and
  its assets, including <I>IN CONTEXT</I> (IC) </LI>
  <LI>changed the medium for publishing IC from print to the web. </LI>
</UL>

<P><BR>
If you want to know more about what's happened, our thinking about moving
from print to the web, and/or have questions/comments to make about this
transition, please read on:<BR>
<BR>
1) In the second half of September we sent letters to the <I>IN CONTEXT</I>
subscriber list dealing with the main points of this transition. Here are
the letters: </P>

<UL>
  <LI><A HREF="altr.htm">Ann Medlock's letter</A> (for the CI Board) describing
  the organizational crisis of the past year. </LI>
  <LI><A HREF="rltr.htm">Robert Gilman's letter</A> describing what's happening
  with IC on the web. </LI>
</UL>

<P><BR>
2) We couldn't cover everything in those letters. For a fuller picture,
we'll develop a Frequently Asked Questions page about the transition. Send
your questions to <A HREF="mailto:ci@context.org">ci@context.org</A><BR>
<BR>
3) We will also develop a page of Reader Responses. Send your comments also
to <A HREF="mailto:ci@context.org">ci@context.org</A> </P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>The Global Context</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>maintained by <A HREF="../PEOPLE/RCGBio.htm">Robert
Gilman </A></I></H4>

<P><BR>
This page is the starting point for an evolving index to state-of-the-art
summary information on many topics important for sustainability, particularly
at a global scale.<BR>
<BR>
Topics are organized under four major heading that are increasingly popular
in the emerging field of sustainable economics, namely <B>Nature </B>(or
Natural Capital), <B>Humankind </B>(or Human Capital), <B>Society &amp;
Culture </B>(or Social Capital), and <B>Hardware </B>(or Built Capital).</P>

<P>Within each topic we plan to look at: </P>

<UL>
  <LI>present conditions and trends (where are we now) </LI>
  <LI>alternative technologies, techniques, and approaches relevant to the
  topic (outer alternatives) </LI>
  <LI>potential changes in values, attitudes and worldviews relevant to the
  topic (inner alternatives) </LI>
  <LI>Plausible futures incorporating these alternatives plus changes in
  the trends due to physical and biological limits. </LI>
</UL>

<P>The same classification system can be use to organize a similar assessments
of conditions, challenges, and opportunities at smaller scales -- from the
nation down to the household.</P>

<P>Filling in this information across the full scope of topics is a major
project that will take months, if not years. At this time (3 Oct 96) we
are just beginning. To jump-start the process, I have created, for a sampling
of topics, pages that lists <I>IN CONTEXT</I> articles on this site relevant
to that topic. In the meantime, we are also preparing the first full trend
analysis, on the topic of &quot;oil&quot; (under Nature: Earth: Non-renewable
energy), which we hope to post in the next few weeks.<BR>
<BR>
Your <A HREF="mailto:rgilman@context.org">comments</A> on this new venture
are most welcome.</P>

<H2><HR>Nature</H2>

<P>Nature or Natural Capital refers to what we would often call &quot;the
environment&quot; -- including land, the atmosphere, water, and all of life
other than humanity. <BR>

<H3><A NAME="what"></A>WHAT IS AFFINITY?</H3>

<P>Affinity is a company, started in 1990, that provides long distance phone
service in cooperation with professional associations and non-profit organizations
(like Context Institute). Affinity uses one of the most advanced telecommunications
network in America (currently MCI), but, as a fully independent company,
provides its own customer service and billing. It buys large blocks of phone
service at a significant discount and passes the savings on to its customers
(10% for residential service) and to the cooperating organizations (an additional
5%). <BR>
<BR>
Affinity also does not advertise, and <I>the money it saves by not advertising
is the real reason it can offer such significant savings</I>.<BR>
<BR>
By signing up with Affinity, you are simply redirecting part of your phone
bill (which now goes to the advertizing budget of your present long distance
carrier) back into your wallet and into the support of Context Institute
and this web site. You save, CI thrives. It's a real win-win!<BR>

</P>

<H3><A NAME="whyci"></A>WHY IS CONTEXT INSTITUTE WORKING WITH AFFINITY?</H3>

<P>For years we've been looking for ways to fund the transition to a more
sustainable culture by:<BR>
</P>

<UL>
  <LI>introducing more efficient practices that could reduce waste and save
  money, and </LI>
  <LI>using some of that saved money to support the cultural transformation
  process. </LI>
</UL>

<P>We've been inspired by the example of &quot;energy service companies.&quot;
These companies find businesses that are using energy inefficiently, offer
to upgrade the business's equipment for no initial cost, and get paid by
sharing a portion of the savings (typically 50% of the savings over five
years). We've written about generalizing the energy service company example
in a number of recent issues, including &quot;<A HREF="ICLIB/IC33/Gilman.htm">Building
The Movement</A>&quot; (page 56,<I> IC</I> #33) and &quot;<A HREF="ICLIB/IC36/Gilman2.htm">Looking
Back From 2003</A>&quot; (page 56, <I>IC </I>#36).<BR>
<BR>
We were thus quite intrigued when we discovered the Affinity program and
realized that it had put this principle into practice. Clearly, it is only
a small step, but it is a step in the right direction -- and it works!<BR>
</P>

<H3><A NAME="experience"></A>OUR EXPERIENCE WITH AFFINITY</H3>

<P>It's been great! Over 200 people (and businesses!) have signed up with
Affinity through Context Institute since we started offering this service
in 1993 -- and of course we use it ourselves. After years of use we can't
see any downside (unless you <I>really</I> want to support AT&amp;T's or
MCI's or Sprint's advertizing budget!).<BR>
<BR>
The financial support is, of course, very welcome. (Affinity donates 5%
of each member's phone bill to Context Institute -- with no extra cost to
the member.) However, we wouldn't do this if it weren't fundamentally a
good, innovative program. It is.</P>

<P>To read what others have to say about the service, click <A HREF="#moreexperience">here</A>.<BR>
</P>

<H3><A NAME="orgwork"></A>CAN MY ORGANIZATION ALSO WORK WITH AFFINITY?</H3>

<P>Yes. Just get in touch with us and we'll be glad to help you get started
as we have for several other organizations. You can <A HREF="mailto:dgilman@context.org">email</A>
us or call us at 360/221-6044.<BR>
</P>

<H3>THE DETAILS</H3>

<P><A NAME="resorbus"></A><B><I>How can I tell if my phone service is &quot;residential&quot;
or &quot;business&quot;?</I></B><BR>
<BR>
Affinity bases its &quot;rates&quot; against those that you are currently
using. Your present long distance calling plan determines what &quot;type&quot;
of customer you will become in the Affinity system. Therefore if your current
calling plan is a residential plan then you will become an Affinity Residential
Customer. If you are currently using a plan that was designed for business,
then you will become a business customer. Unlike the local telephone company,
it does not matter where or how you use your service. It's your current
plan that will determine your rates, discounts and billing format once you
switch to Affinity.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="gsp"></A><B><I>The Affinity Guaranteed Savings Plan and <BR>
Double-Your-Money-Back Guarantee</I></B><BR>
<BR>
Affinity guarantees a minimum percentage savings (10% for residential customers;
5 - 20% for business customers, depending on volume) over any current program
you currently use. If you don't save the minimum percentage on your first
Affinity billing, Affinity will credit your account in full AND write you
a check for that amount, immediately! In addition, if within 90 days following
service activation you become dissatisfied for any reason, Affinity will
pay to switch you back to the carrier of your choice.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="sixsec"></A><B><I>Six-second incremental billing</I></B><BR>
<BR>
This simply means that you only pay for the time you use. Other carriers
round calls up to the next full minute, charging for time that isn't used.
After Affinity's 18-second first minute minimum, calls are billed at six-second
increments. Affinity measures it's minutes by tenths, so, if you make a
call for 2 minutes and 24 seconds, 2.4 minutes will appear on your bill.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="travelcards"></A><B><I>Affinity Travel Cards</I></B><BR>
<BR>
Affinity's Travel Card is one of the very few travel cards in America that
offers six-second incremental billing and bills at discounted rates. Affinity's
per-call surcharge is only 40&#162;. That's almost as much as a 50% savings
over other major carriers! Travel card features include:<BR>
</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Easy access, toll free calling from any phone in America </LI>
  <LI>Multiple call feature </LI>
  <LI>Mis-dial feature </LI>
  <LI>International Calling </LI>
</UL>

<P><A NAME="compbill"></A><B><I>Residential Comparison Billing</I></B><BR>
<BR>
Comparison Billing is an Affinity exclusive for those who previously used
one of the &quot;Big 3&quot; (AT&amp;T, MCI, or Sprint). Every month, call
by call, you see what you would have paid and what you are saving with Affinity.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="giftcert"></A><B><I>Gift Certificate</I></B><BR>
<BR>
Affinity sends you a Gift Certificate for $5 for your first phone line,
plus $3 for any additional lines. You fill out the certificate, return it
with your first Affinity payment, and a credit will be made to your account.
This credit helps to offset any switch fees that your local telephone company
may charge to switch your long distance carrier.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="busbill"></A><B><I>Business Billing</I></B><BR>
<BR>
Affinity's business billing format offers detailed easy-to-read summaries
for increased managment efficiency. Area code patterns, type of call detail,
and long-call analysis are just a few of the summaries provided, and it's
all standard. There is no extra charge.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="accncodes"></A><B><I>Enhanced Accounting Codes</I></B><BR>
<BR>
This is an optional service available to business customers. Accounting
codes are 2 to 7 digits dialed at the end of a called number to categorize
communication expenses. Your choice of validated or non-validated codes
provide a simple, effective way to identify calls made by a pre-determined
employee, project, client, department or other accounting category. There
is a nominal monthly charge, currently $5 for each location.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="800service"></A><B><I>800 Service</I></B><BR>
<BR>
Affinity offers a quality, flexible, 800 service. It works over your regular
business line and can be customized to fit your special needs - from improving
customer relations to increasing profitability. Affinity 800 is billed in
<A HREF="#sixsec">six-second increments</A> - and our rates are guaranteed
to beat your current plan. Affinity 800 service can be international in
scope or limited to an area code, if so desired. There is a nominal monthly
charge for each 800 number. </P>

<P><A NAME="moreexperience"></A><B><I>More Experience</I></B></P>

<P>&quot;The best compliment I can pay you is to say there is no difference
between the service of AT&amp;T, MCI, Sprint and Affinity. Affinity is better
though, because I'm paying a lot less. I'm thrilled with these rates!&quot;
<I>Julia Griewank, Rochester, NH</I></P>

<P>&quot;Westfield residents and businesses received the promised savings,
and we get royalty checks in a timely manner. Affinity has become one of
our most important fundraisers.&quot; <BR>
<I>Joseph McGovern, Executive Director, Boys &amp; Girls Club of Greater
Westfield</I></P>

<P>&quot;Our members are happy with the low rates available through the
Affinity program, and the services have been excellent. As we sign up new
subscribers, our income check from Affinity continues to grow. We've been
trying to figure out the downside to this program -- and we still haven't
found one.&quot; <I>Henry Hanson, Deputy Director, Iowa Trial Lawyers Association</I><BR>

<H1><CENTER>Rethinking National Defense</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by William S. Becker</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
<I>BECAUSE moving in the direction of decentralization and the development
of planetary villages is different from the direction our society has been
heading during the past century or so, it is likely to be dismissed at first
glance as impractical and utopian. Yet in reality it is eminently practical
and well within our means as a society. And not only is it appealing and
workable at a human level, it also can provide creative and effective solutions
to problems that presently seem both unsolvable and out of control, such
as the arms race. The following article is excerpted from William Becker's
booklet, </I>The Indefensible Society <I>(Lorian Press, P.0. Box 147, Middleton,
Wl 53562, $2.75 postpaid), reprinted with permission.</I><BR>
<BR>
At present, we think of national defense and domestic development as two
separate activities. National defense is regarded as the building of arms
and armies, and the formation of military coalitions between nations with
mutual interests. In truth, genuine national defense is intertwined with
social and human needs. The decentralization of energy, food and industrial
production not only returns a measure of control to people and their communities,
it also makes the nation less vulnerable to disruption and attack. The development
and use of renewable resources - combined with conservation - lowers household
energy budgets, keeps more of the nation's wealth from leaking away to mineral-producing
nations, creates new industries and jobs, reduces pollution and eliminates
most types of environmental damage. At the same time, renewables decrease
our dependence on foreign governments so that we are not easily crippled
by supply cutoffs or drawn into resource wars. Weaned from imported oil
and minerals, we do not require a substantial military presence in far-off
corners of the globe. The job of national security becomes much less complicated
and expensive.<BR>
<BR>
Saving money [now spent] on nuclear arms and overseas deployment, we can
help retool American industry to produce life- supporting goods by environmentally
benign processes. We can work more effectively at balancing the federal
budget and paying off our $1 trillion national debt, helping to restore
health to the economy. By making environmental protection and restoration
a continuing priority, we can stabilize the nation's life-support systems
to avoid future sources of insecurity: among them the depletion of soils,
drinkable water, forests, clean air, wildlife habitat and plants critical
to the health of the ecosystem.<BR>
<BR>
Passing along the lessons we have learned in domestic renewal, we can refocus
our foreign policy to promote not dependence, but self- sufficiency among
other nations. We thereby contribute to global stability while cultivating
friendships based not on dependence but on partnership and strength. Promoting
greater use of mediation and arbitration by international bodies like the
United Nations, plus greater use of economic and resource (rather than military)
leverage, we can retire military force as our principal instrument of foreign
policy. Finding symbiosis between our needs and those of our neighbors,
we can build a secure America and become a key force in the creation of
a secure world.
<H4><BR>
New Defense Industries</H4>
In a world of this kind, conservation, solar technology, environmental protection,
recycling, and small-scale food production become our key defense industries.
The national landscape is sprinkled not with nuclear weapons systems, mammoth
factories and big, vulnerable power plants, but with low-technology energy
systems, a multitude of local power plants using largely renewable fuels,
and small facilities producing goods close to their ultimate markets.<BR>
<BR>
Moral, social and economic reasons aside, such a landscape should appeal
to military tacticians. It would be nearly impossible to paralyze a country
with such a diffuse, flexible fabric. Realizing this vision is not so hard
as we might think. Two examples - one theoretical, one concrete - may help
give the vision substance.<BR>
<BR>
At the time of this writing [1981], President Reagan was proposing a defense
budget of $1.5 trillion over the next five years, almost as much money as
the nation has spent on the military since World War II. If only half the
money were allocated to the military, the other half would go a long way
towards building a defensible society. The impact of such a redirection
would be astonishing. Half the budget would completely fund the $750 billion
in new housing, industrial and transportation investments the federal Solar
Energy Research Institute estimates would be needed to fashion a &quot;new
prosperity&quot; and a &quot;sustainable energy future&quot; for America
over the next 20 years. The investment would create valuable, lasting jobs,
retool industry for renewable resource and conservation-oriented production,
and dramatically lower the nation's energy bill ($360 billion in 1980).
Such a program would do much to restore our standing in the world community,
while reducing our dependence upon imported petroleum to a trickle.
<H4><BR>
The Case of Soldiers Grove</H4>
The concrete example can be found in the hilly countryside of southwestern
Wisconsin. After a century of persistent flooding from the temperamental
Kickapoo River the tiny village of Soldiers Grove (population 525) was offered
a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers levee in 1975. The village told the engineers
that it wished instead to move its floodplain buildings, including the community's
entire central business district, to higher ground. One of its reasons:
The people wanted to make peace with the river. They realized that flood
damages were their fault, not the river's. The river simply was trying to
behave like a river. The villagers had unwisely built their community in
the path of one of nature's highways.<BR>
<BR>
Because the Corps of Engineers has traditionally dealt with such problems
by trying to subdue rivers with dams, levees and other structural works,
the government was not receptive to the idea. Placing the burden of change
on people rather than nature was a radical notion, long considered politically
volatile by the Corps and by Congress. The villagers tried unsuccessfully
for three years to win the federal assistance they needed to undertake relocation.
Finally, in July 1978, the Kickapoo resolved the stalemate by hitting Soldiers
Grove with the largest flood in the village's history, completely destroying
a number of buildings. Embarrassed federal officials finally responded by
offering partial funding.<BR>
<BR>
As they prepared for relocation, the villagers decided to engage in holistic
planning. By that, they meant they would design a new central business district
which was as environmentally benign as possible and which respected the
need for resource conservation. They chose wood as their primary building
material since it was a renewable, local resource which used comparatively
little energy for processing and transportation. Then, passing the first
ordinance of its kind in the nation, the villagers voted to require that
each of the 40 new commercial structures in the relocated downtown be designed
to receive at least half its heating energy from the sun.<BR>
<BR>
The villagers now are completing construction of the nation's first solar-heated
business district. They carried out extensive &quot;microclimate&quot; analysis
to ensure that each building made maximum use of solar heating while taking
advantage of terrain and vegetation to block winter winds and to use summer
breezes for cooling. The typical new structure contains insulation levels
of R-36 in its walls and R-72 in its attic, several times higher than required
by state building codes. The typical building receives not 50 but 75 percent
of its heating energy from passive and hybrid solar systems, an unexpected
achievement in the north country. Through intelligent planning, most of
the buildings have been constructed at a cost of less than $40 per square
foot - comparable to the cost of conventionally heated buildings in the
region.<BR>
<BR>
Thus, facing the crisis of repeated flooding, the villagers assured their
future as a community, doing so in a way which respected natural and human
needs. They thought beyond their immediate situation to consider their obligations
as a village interrelating with the rest of the world. Yet the ecological
ethic did not mean sacrifice. It produced greater benefit. The new energy
systems, high energy efficiency and careful use of the elements mean that
Soldiers Grove will not be greatly affected by future cutoffs of fossil
fuels. Meanwhile, each businessman's fuel bills have been greatly reduced
- one 7,000 square foot supermarket used no fossil fuels for heat during
the winter of 1980-1981.<BR>
<BR>
The relocation project is remarkable not only for its demonstration of new
energy and flood-damage prevention techniques, but because the innovation
was conceived and employed by a low-income community, inhabited mostly by
elderly and conservative rural folks in the Snow Belt. The project has completely
turned around the spirit of the village, from a mood of depression and pending
crisis to high energy and excitement because the people found a way to take
the future back into their own hands.<BR>
<BR>
Multiplied to national scale, the creativity exercised by the people of
Soldiers Grove would produce similar benefits. It would reduce the taxation
of environmental resources, improve the economy, insulate us from energy
interruptions and liberate the United States from the need to exercise military
muscle in remote and unstable corners of the world.
<H4><BR>
Our Challenge</H4>
Soldiers Grove challenges the rest of us to follow. If one unlikely village
can transform itself, so can we all. We can make peace and prosperity based
on thoughtfulness and cooperation rather than on conflict. Self-realization
and interrelationship sound fancy, but they are stuff that we build with
our hands.<BR>
<BR>
It is within our means to make national policy in which every can recycled,
every BTU of energy conserved, every solar collector installed or drop of
water preserved moves us towards global security and healing. We can fashion
policy in which those activities are supported and empowered, rather than
contradicted and undermined, by the policies and resources of government.
Such policy makes full use of technology, but remains people-centered rather
than technology-centered. It replaces our sense of hopelessness and fatalism
with a sense of individual contribution to the future. It aligns government
action with personal action so that each of us, wherever we live and work,
becomes a key participant in making and preserving peace. It engages rather
than ignores our genius.<BR>
<BR>
If we wish to find national security, that is where our search must lead
us: to new understandings and social policies which empower each of us as
a peacemaker and a healer; to a determined commitment by all of us to serve
as soldiers in a peaceful army building a civilization worthy of our potential
as human beings.<BR>

<I>WHEREIN you can make a first acquaintance with this project, with the
idea of a humane sustainable culture, and with this issue's theme of being
a planetary villager.</I><B><BR>
<BR>
The <I>IN CONTEXT </I>Project</B><BR>
<BR>
WELCOME to the first issue of <I>IN CONTEXT. </I>What you hold in your hands
is like a new born colt - up, on its feet and full of frisk, yet still a
little awkward in places. We hope you will enjoy it, and we hope you will
join us in helping it grow into the graceful and effective workhorse it
is intended to be. But more on that later. Now we need to get on to some
explanations.<BR>
<BR>
What is this all about? The overall goal of this project is to explore and
clarify just what is involved in a humane sustainable culture - and how
we might get there. What is meant by a &quot;humane sustainable culture&quot;?
Later in this introduction I'll describe this in a bit more detail, but
the general idea is a culture (or society) that is meaningful and satisfying
to those who are part of it and that does not need to destroy or deplete
its environment in order to survive. It is a way of life that could potentially
be lived, with satisfaction, by generation after generation. As an idea
and a vision, its roots are very old, but it has become more needed and
more possible through such things as the world- wide increase in population,
the development of electronic communications and information systems, the
end of cheap fossil fuels, the world-wide deterioration of forests, soils,
air, water, etc., growing levels of literacy, changing life spans, and the
existence of nuclear weapons. Less obviously, but no less importantly, it
has also become more possible through the quiet, small scale efforts of
people around the globe, who, especially during the last decade, have been
exploring such things as appropriate technology, cooperative community living,
new forms of organization and decision making, and ecologically sound agriculture.
What we want to do now is to go beyond a general hopeful vision and a few
promising small scale experiments to a deeper, clearer, and more specific
understanding of how such a &quot;good life that could be passed on to your
great grandchildren&quot; could actually be developed.<BR>
<BR>
The primary tools of the project are two publications - this quarterly journal
and a catalog/directory (available in mid- 1983). Each issue of the journal
will deal with a major theme. We invite contributions of essays, poems,
carefully researched reports, graphics, interviews, fiction, and more to
convey the concepts, the practical/technical aspects and the experiential
side of that theme. We want the journal to actually <I>be </I>the kind of
cultural wholeness that it is discussing and reflecting. The catalog/directory
adds to this by providing advertising space and listings for businesses,
individuals and groups who are working towards the goal of a humane, sustainable
culture - a vehicle through which people can get in touch with each other
in immediate, practical ways.<BR>
<BR>
We call it a project, rather than just a pair of publications, because we
want to emphasize the process as well as the output. That process is a broad
scale cooperative effort, with lots of reader involvement, directed towards
shaping a workable common vision of a humane sustainable culture. The themes
for upcoming issues, together with specific topics and questions, will be
announced 6 months before publication (see Previews &amp; Prattle) and the
readership as well as the project advisors will be asked to consider these
questions and contribute material. Those of us who are initiating this project
are a diverse, geographically scattered collection of people who share the
belief that one of the major challenges our society (indeed our planet)
faces is how to work together, build a basic common vision, and at the same
time honor our differences and our individuality. This project is for us
an experiment, a laboratory for learning better how to live that balance
beyond our local communities. We represent many different styles and approaches,
and we want to become better able, with respect and humor, to use this diversity
as an asset. We hope you will join us in this search.<BR>
<BR>
The project is called <I>IN CONTEXT to </I>refer to what we see as perhaps
the central characteristic of a workable sustainable culture - namely, that
its people will act with an awareness of and concern for the larger natural
and human world around them. They will live in the context of the trees
and the soil, of their neighbors and of people across the world. Of course,
all of us live in these contexts anyway. The difference is in choosing to
do so consciously, and with as much harmony as possible. In this regard,
you might enjoy knowing that the word &quot;context&quot; comes from the
Latin for &quot;to weave together&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
It might also be helpful, in introducing this project, to describe a bit
about who &quot;we&quot; (the people initiating this project) are. The <A HREF="#List">list</A>
at the end of this page gives you specific names, but you may not recognize
any, and it is rather unlikely that you would know them all. We are a diverse
group, some more widely known than others, but none exactly a household
word. We include small business people, parents, corporate executives, authors,
politicians, secretaries, manual laborers, and craftspeople. Some have Ph.D's
and some got their education outside of schools. Some of us live in cities,
some in rural areas, and some (like a growing number of retirees) keep moving
around. That is all pretty conventional. A bit more unusual is that a number
of us live in intentional communities, although most of us don't, and intentional
community is not the thread that holds this list together.<BR>
<BR>
The major things that we have in common are three. 1) We share a sense that
our society (indeed the whole planet) is going through a time of major cultural
change. This, too, is hardly an unusual perception. From historians like
Arnold Toynbee, to more recent studies like the U.S. Government's <I>Global
2000 Report, </I>Alvin Toffler's <I>Third Wave, </I>and John Naisbett's
<I>Megatrends, </I>essentially everyone who has seriously studied our present
historical situation agrees that this is a time of profound change.<BR>
<BR>
2) We also feel that both individuals and society can deal with these changes
in ways that are positive - that move us towards a more satisfying and workable
way of life. Not that there aren't difficulties and baffling paradoxical
quagmires, but in spite of all this, there are successes as well, and on
the whole it is worth trying. For many of us this feeling grows out of personal
experience, out of living in small, cooperative communities out of learning
to be in some ways more self-sufficient yet at the same time more interconnected,
out of learning to be more at home with ourselves so that we can change
ourselves as well as the world around us. Not that we have it all figured
out, but our (mostly independent) experience so far is encouraging. In this
also, we are fortunately not at all unique. There are many, many people
who share this sense of encouragement about the world's potential future.<BR>
<BR>
3) The third thread that holds us together is simply that we know each other.
(Not each to every other one, but enough to form a sense of connection.)
That's a characteristic that's very handy for starting projects, but we
are acutely aware that there are many other people (perhaps including you)
who are at least as qualified to speak to the issues this project will raise.
We just happen to be the ones who are getting this project rolling, and
we hope many more people will take part in it as it develops.<BR>
<BR>
Hopefully this gives you a first answer to &quot;What is this all about?&quot;
You can get a second answer straight from what you hold in your hands, since
it is a sample of the kind of journal we intend to produce (although with
some unavoidable first issue limitations, like a lack of Letters To The
Editor). Finally, in the last section (Previews &amp; Prattle) you will
find more detailed information on how the project works, what's coming in
future issues, and how you can participate.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="Sustain"></A><B>The Issue Of Sustainability</B><BR>
<BR>
It is time now to go a little more deeply into what is meant by a &quot;humane
sustainable culture&quot;. At this stage of its development, it is not a
precise concept, and I don't think anyone knows, in detail, just what might
be involved in developing such a culture in our present historical situation.
There are a lot of ideas (backed up by a growing amount of experience and
analysis), and it is a question being actively explored by many groups and
individuals around the world, but it is still more of a beckoning direction,
a light in the distance, than a known totality for which unified blueprints
exist. Nevertheless, there are some general characteristics that can be
discerned, and I would like to summarize them here.<BR>
<BR>
First, we are including the humane part in this basic phrase to make centrally
clear our commitment to respecting the human importance of each individual
within the society. I could now go on and attempt to define more precisely
what a humane culture is, but I won't. Philosophers have been struggling
with definitions of the &quot;just society&quot; for thousands of years,
with the main result that the crux of the matter is more in the performance
than in the words. Not that concepts and structures aren't important for
humaneness - they are - but these can be better dealt with at a less general
level, as they will be in the articles in this and succeeding issues of
<I>IN CONTEXT.</I><BR>
<BR>
Sustainability, on the other hand, is both less familiar as an issue and
more amenable to useful discussion. Not that it too isn't a very old issue.
Farmers have been concerned about it for thousands of years, but we are
less in touch with that tradition and the range of issues involved in sustainability
has changed dramatically in just the past few decades. To appreciate that
range, perhaps we should quickly review some of the indications that our
present industrial society is <I>not </I>sustainable. Obviously, any society
that depends on an exponential growth in the quantity of things it produces
and is powered by non- renewable fossil fuels can't keep going on and on.
In recent years, the classic study of this problem is described in <I>Limits
to Growth, </I>by Donella Meadows et al., in which they found, using computer
modeling of the global situation, that the world would experience a catastrophic
decline in industrial output, food production, and population sometime during
the next century if we tried to keep going the way we have up until 1970.
This conclusion was based not just on running out of oil. They were able
to use their computer model to test questions such as &quot;Suppose the
world miraculously had an inexhaustibly supply of oil?&quot; What they found
was that if a lack of oil wasn't the problem, then a lack of other scarce
minerals would be, and if not these, then a lack of farmable land, or a
lack of fresh water, or an increase in pollution. Population growth made
all these problems worse, but even stabilizing population didn't solve the
problem; it only postponed it a few years. Only by stabilizing both population
and resource consuming economic activity, and by reducing the system's dependence
on non-renewable resources, were they able to find a model that did not
go through a catastrophic collapse. Since then other, more detailed studies
have come to essentially the same conclusions.<BR>
<BR>
More recently, the situation has been summarized by Lester Brown of the
Worldwatch Institute in his book <I>Building a Sustainable Society. </I>Among
other things, he points out that the world per capita production of wood,
fish, beef, grain, and oil have all peaked and are now declining. In other
words, the problems foreseen in <I>Limits To Growth </I>may already be upon
us. As steps toward a sustainable culture he emphasizes the need for stabilizing
world population, protecting cropland, reforestation, recycling, conserving
all forms of energy, and developing renewable energy. He also points out
that there are hopeful signs of motion in these directions already, and
that in general the barriers to doing all these things are not primarily
technical, but are a matter of values and focused political will.<BR>
<BR>
Another helpful perspective on sustainability comes from ecology. The kinds
of plant and animal communities that move into a newly cleared piece of
ground (pioneer or immature ecosystems) are characteristically different
from the plant and animal communities that will eventually develop there
(climax or mature ecosystems). The pioneer species put their emphasis on
rapid growth and in the process are wasteful of energy and resources. The
level of species diversity is low as is the amount of nutrient recycling.
Climax ecosystems, on the other hand, put their emphasis on sustaining the
existing system, with high efficiency, high diversity and only slow growth.<BR>
<BR>
From these and similar studies, the following general pattern emerges. The
basic, almost defining, characteristics of a sustainable culture are that
its primary energy source be sunshine (directly or in the forms of wind,
hydropower, and vegetation); that its material resources be used frugally
and recycled; that its population be stable; that the part of its economic
activity that is resource consuming and/or polluting be stabilized at as
low a level as possible; and that it does not deteriorate the natural environment
(soils, forests, wildlife, water, air, etc.). Not quite so obvious, but
often thought to go with these are a decentralization of populations out
of urban areas and a greater equity of wealth among nations.<BR>
<BR>
These technical and statistical characteristics give a fascinating glimpse,
but they are only part of the picture. Equally important is the social/psychological
side of sustainability. Such things as stable populations and environmental
protection are expressions of definite value choices. How does a society,
and even more so a planet, come to make these choices? How does it implement
them? How does it effectively pass these values on from one generation to
the next <I>for many, many generations? </I>What forms of education, of
work patterns, of housing, of inheritance, of government, of play, etc.
contribute to this human side of a sustainable culture? What changes might
there be in laws related to land ownership, corporations, licensed professions?
Beyond this, how might the balance shift between the force of law and the
weight of public opinion as means for maintaining social order? How would
such a society protect itself from bullying and coercion: by individual,
by organizations, by governments both internally and internationally?<BR>
<BR>
About these questions less is known, nor are they the kind of thing that
can be answered by analytic computer studies. Indeed, cultures are sufficiently
complex systems that we will probably never have detailed answers until
we actually go ahead and do it as a whole society, and even then we'll do
a lot of muddling and groping. Yet there are places we can look for help.
There is material from history, anthropology, sociology, psychology, and
related disciplines that is useful. In addition, there are many people,
often in small groups but individuals as well, who are trying to work out
these issues in specific practical ways in their own lives. Their lives
are a kind of cultural laboratory - never quite the same as the full scale
society yet rich with suggestive experience that applies directly to our
present historical situation and its challenges.<BR>
<BR>
Many of us who are initiating this <I>IN CONTEXT </I>project fit that description
as cultural experimenters, and it is because of this experience that we
are motivated to get this project moving. We are doing this, not with the
sense that we have the answers to these questions about how a sustainable
society would actually work, but because these are immediate practical issues
for us and we want to work together and with many others on developing at
least &quot;approaches worth trying&quot; if not answers. We are not starting
from zero. There is much that we have learned and want to make available
to others, but the more we learn, the more we see we have yet to learn,
the more we see the value of learning from others, and the more our eyes
are opened to wisdom from people we had not previously understood.<B><BR>
<BR>
Being A Planetary Villager</B><BR>
<BR>
Our theme for this first issue is about living both in community and in
the larger world; about what it means to have a well developed, rooted connection
with a specific place and people, and yet at the same time have many connections
and feel comfortably at home in the larger world - and how this fits into
and contributes to a humane sustainable culture. We are describing this
kind of local/global existence as &quot;being a planetary villager&quot;.
If you are unfamiliar with that term, don't worry. We have, in a sense,
just coined it, although it is obviously related to the almost as recently
coined term of &quot;planetary village&quot;. I don't want to repeat here
the discussions of these terms that comes later in this issue but there
may be some initial clarification that would be helpful.<BR>
<BR>
First, the term planetary village is <I>very different from </I>the more
familiar term, &quot;global village&quot;. The idea of the global village
is that because of jet travel and electronic communications, the whole globe
becomes as interconnected as villages are. It uses the word, village, as
a metaphor. It says that the globe is <I>like </I>a village, but not that
it actually <I>is </I>a village. It is always used in the singular, and
is in fact a description of the state of the world rather than a name for
some thing. Planetary villages, on the other hand, are <I>real </I>villages.
What makes them different from Indian villages or Nigerian villages is that
they exist in the context of the whole planet. I don't want to make too
sharp a distinction here. There is no contradiction in the idea of a Nigerian
planetary village. Planetary villages are expected to be richly diverse,
yet different from traditional villages in their sense of living in a larger
context.<BR>
<BR>
A second point of confusion is that the &quot;villages&quot; in planetary
villages is intended to refer to small towns and neighborhoods in cities
as well as rural villages. Our language unfortunately doesn't have any term
that clearly refers to &quot;self-acknowledged human settlements of a few
hundred people in both urban and rural settings&quot;, so we will just have
to make do with villages until someone coins a better term.<BR>
<BR>
Third, focusing on the villager, as we are doing in this issue, rather than
the village brings in a different perspective. Discussions of the village
tend, naturally, to emphasize the place - its architecture, economics, internal
community structure and lifestyle. Focusing on the people gets us to consider
both life within the community and the connections beyond the community
- both the planetary and the villager sides of the image. This issue is
devoted to the challenge of this balance, and how it might function in and
serve a sustainable culture.<BR>
<BR>
Finally, it should be noted that the term planetary villages is sometimes
used to refer specifically to a few intentional communities, such as Findhorn
in Scotland and Auroville in India, that are consciously trying to develop
this way of life. The danger here is in narrowing the concept by referring
to this small group as <I>the </I>planetary villages. I would prefer to
think of these as &quot;pioneering planetary villages&quot;, and keep the
basic term broad enough to embrace the whole world.

<H1><CENTER>Sustainability: The State<BR>
Of The Movement</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by <A HREF="../../PEOPLE/RCGBio.htm">Robert Gilman</A></I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
What is &quot;the sustainability movement&quot;? What are its roots, and
where is it going? Like most genuine social movements, it defies easy definition.
The borders are fuzzy, and the participants are all too diverse and changing
to be pinned down by a set of words. This movement compounds these problems
by the unusually broad scope of topics it addresses, as well as its deep
resistance to being limited by labels and boundaries.<BR>
<BR>
Nevertheless I feel strongly that the movement exists, and that the work
of the people within it offers the world some of the best reasons to hope
for a positive future. In this article I would like to give you an overview
of the essence of the movement and where it is headed. In doing this I want
to emphasize that, while we at <I>IN CONTEXT </I>consider ourselves to be
part of this movement, we do not claim to speak for it. What follows is
only our perspective.<BR>
<BR>
CHARACTERIZING THE MOVEMENT<BR>
<BR>
For the past decade or so the sustainability movement has been:
<UL>
  <LI>a small number of <I>researchers, innovators and activists<BR>
</I><BR>
  <LI>who have taken a <I>whole-systems approach</I> to<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>the challenge of <I>developing human systems, technologies and lifestyles</I>
that can provide high quality <I>and</I> environmentally benign ways of
life for all of humankind, now and many generations into the future. 
</UL>
<B><BR>
Sustainability</B> * The first key concept here is &quot;sustainability.&quot;
While the word is a mouthful, what it refers to is a very old and very simple
concept - the ability to keep going over the long haul. As a value, it refers
to giving equal weight in your decisions to the future as well as the present.
You might think of it as extending the Golden Rule through time, so that
you do unto future generations (as well as to your present fellow beings)
as you would have them do unto you.<BR>
<BR>
Many traditional cultures hold this value very strongly. For example, in
their councils, the Iroquois and other Native American groups required that
each decision be evaluated by asking &quot;What impact will this have on
the seventh generation from today?&quot; On the other hand, the world is
full of the ruins of civilizations that died because they sacrificed the
value of sustainability to the pressures (and greed) of the present - they
overgrazed, overfarmed and generally overexploited their surroundings and
their people.<BR>
<BR>
These past social/ecological collapses were always local. Wilderness was
available to start the cycle over again. What is unique to our situation
is that not only must we sustain ourselves; we must be careful to do so
in ways that also sustain the planet's major life systems. We humans have
grown in number and power to the point where we control the destiny not
only of our own species, but the millions of others with whom we share this
relatively tiny globe. This recognition that the <I>un</I>sustainability
of present day societies and institutions is a <I>global</I> crisis is central
to the sustainability movement.<B><BR>
<BR>
Whole-systems thinking</B> * The second key concept is that of &quot;whole-systems,&quot;
an approach which, surprisingly, seems to more profoundly define the movement
than even the concern for sustainability. What distinguishes whole-systems
thinking is a keen awareness of the importance of interconnections, relationships,
consequences, and feedback loops. It involves a willingness to consider
all significant aspects of an issue, and not to jump to appealing (but usually
wrong) simplifi-cations.<BR>
<BR>
The movement's concern with sustainability comes as a <I>result</I> of taking
this whole-systems approach seriously. This approach also leads naturally
to the other characteristics of the movement that follow.<B><BR>
<BR>
Humane <I>and</I> biocentric focus</B> * People in the sustainability movement
value both the human and the non-human <I>equally</I>. We resist the temptation
to pit humans against nature, and we are often just as interested in issues
of economic fairness and human rights as we are in environmental well-being.
Indeed, we will usually insist that separations between these various categories
are artificial and misleading.<B><BR>
<BR>
Learning and innovation</B> * Closely associated with the movement's whole-systems
perspective is the high value it places on learning and innovation as a
response to problems, rather than critique and complaint. The movement certainly
has many who are skillful at criticism, but criticism is used as a tool,
not an end. For the movement is basically vision-oriented - it is motivated
by a desire to build a better world, not just tear down the one we have.
The movement is <I>not</I> peopled by Pollyannas: it faces our culture's
problems squarely, with a hard-nosed realism, but it is decidedly optimistic
about our capacity to learn and grow. <BR>
<BR>
This optimistic bias is especially reflected in the movement's &quot;make
it better&quot; attitude towards science and technology. There is much in
present day science and technology that the movement strongly criticizes,
but it is nevertheless at home with the spirit of empirically-tested exploration
that characterizes science at its best. Interestingly, a significant number
of those who are most visibly active in the movement come out of conventional
scientific careers - Wes Jackson, Dana Meadows, Brian Swimme, Amory Lovins,
David Spangler, John Todd, and Danaan Parry, to name just a few.<B><BR>
<BR>
Leadership and partnership</B> * It also seems characteristic of people
in this movement to adopt the role of &quot;servant leaders&quot; - acting
in the background, doing what needs doing, not directly calling attention
to themselves. Like enzymes, we often work to break down artificial barriers
and create partnerships; and like catalysts, we seek leverage points or
bottlenecks where a little effort can set processes in motion that have
beneficial, system-wide effects (citizen diplomacy is a good example of
both strategies). As Hazel Henderson puts it, we are &quot;designing new
cultural DNA&quot; and trying to splice it directly into society's genes.<B><BR>
<BR>
Spirituality</B> * There is a tremendous diversity of spiritual orientation
within the movement, from active members of various traditional religions
to free thinkers of all types. Nevertheless, it is accurate to say that
most people in the movement are comfortable with the <I>idea</I> of spirituality
- with the idea that there may be &quot;more things in heaven and earth&quot;
than is included in the standard materialist description of the Universe.
There is also no sense of antagonism between spirituality and science. Indeed,
if there is a spiritual bias in the movement, it is towards &quot;creation-centered&quot;
spirituality - including the sense that what we are learning about the world
through the sciences has positive spiritual significance.<B><BR>
<BR>
What we're not * </B>Finally, a note of distinction. The sustainability
movement sometimes gets misidentified with two other much better known social
movements - the environmental movement and the new age movement. This confusion
is partially understandable, since many of the people and concepts that
we would identify with the sustainability movement are also claimed by one
or both of these other movements.<BR>
<BR>
However, there are important ways in which the sustainability movement is
different and distinct. It <I>insists</I> on a whole-systems approach, whereas
the environmental movement has focused on the human impact upon non-human
systems, and the new age movement has focused on spirituality and personal
growth. Unlike much of the environmental movement, it is vision- and solution-oriented.
Unlike the new age movement, it is primarily concerned with the nuts and
bolts of ecological and cultural health. People in the sustainability movement
are generally happy to work <I>with</I> these and other social movements,
but in doing so we retain our commitment to a practical, positive whole-systems
approach. 
<H4><BR>
ON THE HORIZON</H4>
During 1980s most of the people in the sustainability movement worked quietly
on the outside, putting their energy into such things as developing alternatives
in education, agriculture, business organization and energy use; building
citizen diplomacy with the Soviet Union; tracking the deterioration in the
natural environment; and drawing up plans for redesigned communities, cities,
and entire economies. <BR>
<BR>
Today their perspectives and innovations are becoming mainstream at a dizzying
pace. To cite just a few examples, the U.S. Department of Agriculture is
now giving its blessing to &quot;sustainable agriculture,&quot; the World
Bank now supports the idea of &quot;sustainable development,&quot; and it
looks like the U.S. Department of Energy is about to make energy efficiency
the cornerstone of its new energy policy! There is much that remains inadequate
about the way these institutions are approaching these concepts, but there
is no denying that the level of public credibility for people within the
movement and for their ideas is dramatically higher than it was just a few
years ago.<BR>
<BR>
How will these welcome changes affect the movement? Profoundly. In the coming
years I expect there will be:
<UL>
  <LI><I>a greater emphasis on putting the movement's innovations into broad
practice.</I> The articles in this issue are full of steps in that direction.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI><I>a need to communicate with a much larger public.</I> The increased
awareness of environmental and social problems - from rainforest destruction
to drug use - has dramatically raised interest in the kinds of innovative
solutions the movement has to offer, but the movement is still not adequately
telling its story<BR>
<BR>
  <LI><I>increased attention to redesigning human institutions, especially
in economics and governance.</I> The bottleneck to developing a humane and
sustainable world is clearly no longer technological nor ecological - though
ecological imbalances may cause great trouble in the years ahead. But while
we know a great deal about what could be done in such areas as energy efficiency
and environmental restoration, we know a lot less about the design of humane
and sustainable <I>human</I> institutions - institutions that could both
implement the needed solutions quickly and effectively and provide an ongoing
vehicle for a fulfilling and environmentally sane quality of life.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI><I>a broadened sense of participation.</I> All of this increased visibility,
and ever-increasing sense of urgency in the society, is likely to change
the movement from a relatively small and unnoticed group of researchers
and innovators to a broad movement affecting all aspects of society. We
need to be prepared to step into this role, and to provide assistance and
leadership to others who want to put their energies into promoting the planet's
real agenda. 
</UL>
<BR>
We at <I>IN CONTEXT</I> feel the time has come for the sustainability movement
to overcome its Hamlet-like reluctances. We must be willing to stand up
and be identified so that policymakers and the wider public can perceive
what we have to offer. We also need to make it easier for people to &quot;join&quot;
the movement in some way - to encourage them to make a stand for a humane
and sustainable world, work for the adoption of innovative solutions, and
spread the spirit of optimism and partnership. <I>IN CONTEXT</I> and the
Context Institute are committed to accelerating this process; and we invite
our readers, friends, and colleagues to work with us.<BR>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>&quot;Sustainability&quot;</H1>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><BR>
<I>By Robert Gilman<BR>
from the 1992 UIA/AIA &quot;Call for Sustainable Community Solutions&quot;</I></P>

<P>What is &quot;sustainability,&quot; and why is it generating so much
interest? In its broadest scope, sustainability refers to the ability of
a society, ecosystem, or any such on-going system to continue functioning
into the indefinite future without being forced into decline through the
exhaustion or overloading of key resources on which that system depends.
<BR>
<BR>
In the case of society, those resources might be material, such as fuels
or topsoil; they might be social, such as educational levels or the sense
of fair play; or they might be waste-absorbing natural systems, such as
wetlands or the atmosphere.<BR>
<BR>
Given this definition, it is not surprising that there are grave concerns
about the sustainability of today's human societies. Consider just two examples
from a long a growing list of concerns:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>World per capita grain production has been in decline since the mid
  1980s due to soil degradation and the loss of farmland, and shows every
  sign of declining still further in the coming decades. The world fish catch
  shows a similar pattern as fisheries around the world are over-fished and
  exhausted. Yet world population, and thus the need for more food, continues
  to grow.<BR>
  
  <LI>Industrial society is overwhelmingly dependent on fossil fuels, and
  continues to build its physical plant as if these fuels will be cheaply
  available forever, in spite of the fact that world oil production peaked
  in 1979, and every year damage from acid rain and concern about CO2-produced
  global warming grow greater.
</UL>

<P>More generally, we are using nonrenewable resources as if they were in
infinite supply, we are pouring wastes into the environment as if they could
be infinitely absorbed, we are harvesting renewable resources faster than
they can be replenished, and we are allowing our numbers to grow as if there
will always be &quot;more&quot; - more land, more food, more everything.
Our society has not yet comprehended that the world is indeed round. If
we persist in this ignorance, business-as-usual will lead humanity (and
millions of other species) to a very grim future in the coming decades.<BR>
<BR>
Fortunately, business-as-usual is not the only path open to us. Many specialists
in the area of sustainable development are convinced that humanity could
have a bright future if the whole world:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>made use of currently proven technologies and techniques 1) to greatly
  improve the efficiency of our resource use, 2) to greatly reduce our waste-stream
  going into the environment, and 3) to maintain and conserve renewable resource
  systems, like topsoil, fisheries, forests, and water supplies<BR>
  
  <LI>stabilized the human population through such proven techniques as the
  broad availability of birth control means and enhanced quality of life
  for women and families<BR>
  
  <LI>stabilized overall consumption of resources through switching, especially
  in industrialized countries, to a focus on &quot;better&quot; and &quot;enough&quot;
  (quality) rather than &quot;more&quot; (quantity).
</UL>

<P>All three of these steps are within our human capability. Our future
depends on whether we take them.<BR>
<BR>
If we do succeed in developing a sustainable society, it is likely that
it will have the following characteristics:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>All material processes will be designed to be cyclical. There will
  be no such thing as waste or pollution, only outputs from one system serving
  as assimilatable inputs to another.<BR>
  
  <LI>The driving physical energy used by society will be renewable solar
  energy, either directly or in forms such as wind, hydropower, and biomass.<BR>
  
  <LI>The human population and the quantity of material goods will be stable
  in size (or gradually declining). This does not imply a static society,
  for changes in quality can continue unabated; indeed they may accelerate.
</UL>

<H1><CENTER>The Architects' Chicago Declaration</CENTER>
</H1>
<P><CENTER></CENTER>
<P>What follows is the text of the UIA (Union Internationale des Architects)/AIA
(American Institute of Architects) &quot;Declaration of Interdependence
for a Sustainable Future,&quot; created at the World Congress of Architects,
June 1993. The Congress was attended by more than 10,000 design professionals
from around the world and had the theme of &quot;Architecture at the Crossroads:
Designing for a Sustainable Future.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The process of creating it went as follows: Context Institute Director Robert
Gilman was asked by the UIA and AIA to create a draft declaration in conjunction
with a group of four architects from around the world. They distributed
a few thousand copies of that draft to the Congress and asked for feedback.
Over the next day or so they incorporated that feedback and shaped the final
document. The UIA and AIA presidents signed it and then read the commitment
part of the declaration to the closing plenary session. Large banners were
available after the session for individuals to sign-on to the declaration
-- which about 3000 participants did.

integrates consideration of resource and energy efficiency, healthy buildings
and materials, ecologically and socially sensitive land-use, and an aesthetic
sensitivity that inspires, affirms, and ennobles; * sustainable design can
significantly reduce adverse human impacts on the natural environment while
simultaneously improving quality of life and economic well being;<B><BR>
<BR>
We commit ourselves, </B><BR>
<BR>
as members of the world's architectural and building-design professions,
individually and through our professional organisations, to:<BR>
<UL>
  <LI>Place environmental and social sustainability at the core of our practices
and professional responsibilities<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Develop and continually improve practices, procedures, products, curricula,
services, and standards that will enable the implementation of sustainable
design<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Educate our fellow professionals, the building industry, clients,
students, and the general public about the critical importance and substantial
opportunities of sustainable design<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Establish policies, regulations, and practices in government and business
that ensure sustainable design becomes normal practice<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Bring all existing and future elements of the built environment -
in their design, production, use, and eventual reuse - up to sustainable
design standards.

<BR>
Robert Gilman received his bachelor's from the University of California
at Berkeley and his Ph.D. in astrophysics from Princeton University. He
taught and did research at the University of Minnesota, the Harvard Smithsonian
Astrophysical Observatory and served as a Research Associate at NASA's Institute
for Space Studies.<BR>
<BR>
Since 1975, when he decided that &quot;the stars could wait, but the planet
couldn't,&quot; he has devoted himself to the study of global sustainability,
futures research, and strategies for positive cultural change. He is the
founding editor of the internationally acclaimed journal, <EM>IN CONTEXT</EM>,
which in 1991 and 1994 won the <EM>Utne Reader</EM>s Alternative Press Award
for &quot;Best Coverage of Emerging Issues.&quot; Robert has a wide background
in cultural history, innovation theory, sustainable economics, appropriate
technology, and resource conservation. With his wife <A HREF="DAGBio.htm">Diane</A>,
he designed and hand-built their own solar home. They lived for three years
in Winslow CoHousing, one of the first cohousing projects in the US based
on this Danish model for community living. They now live in Langley, a small
pedestrian-oriented town on Whidbey Island, Washington, USA.<BR>
<BR>
Together Robert and Diane have two children, ages 14 and 24, plus 27 years
of marriage. <BR>
<BR>

<BR>
Diane Gilman received her Bachelor of Arts from the University of California
at Santa Barbara in Art. She was a professional water color painter and
potter up to the time of developing Context Institute with her husband,
Robert in 1979. In addition to serving for ten years as Associate Publisher
of <I>I<A HREF="../ICLIB/icintro.htm">N CONTEXT</A></I>, she has, since
1985, coordinated the Institute's extensive citizen diplomacy work with
the USSR, and is cofounder, with Robert Gilman, of the Foundation for Russian/American
Economic Cooperation based in Seattle, Washington.<BR>
<BR>
She heads up CI's Sustainable Community Program, which published a report
in 1991 on EcoVillages and Sustainable Communities from around the world
including guidelines for the development of these communities as well as
case studies. She also: 
<UL>
  <LI>is responsible for much of the Institute's international networking
and liaison, particularly with Europe, Scandinavia and the former Soviet
Union.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>was, from March 1992 to September 1995, the western coordinator for
the development of an ecologically sustainable community outside of St.
Petersburg, Russia.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>helped with the initial development and coordination of the <A HREF="http://www.gaia.org/">Global
EcoVillage Network</A>, a support network for model communities that are
serving as laboratories for how we can live more sustainably on the planet,
including in urban, rural, developed and less developed situations. There
are 7 participating eco-villages in the network at various stages of development
from the following countries: Australia, Germany, Hungary, Ladhak, Russia,
Scotland, and the USA. The first meeting of the network was held in Denmark,
June of 1994; the second in Germany, April of 1995; the third in Scotland,
October 1995. The next will be in Australia in October 1996.<BR>

<BR>
There is a lot of talk these days about being in the &quot;post-Cold War
era.&quot; Certainly, the end of the Cold War was a major event, but is
this really the most helpful way to characterize the present time historically?
I don't think so. Indeed, to me the end of the Cold War is just part of
a much larger set of historical trends. Understanding these trends can enable
us to work with history, rather than struggling against it, and thus be
much more effective in contributing to the development of a humane and sustainable
world.<BR>
<BR>
What are those trends? I would emphasize three: 
<UL>
<LI>Looking forward to the next few decades, it appears that our fossil
fuel-based industrial society will be increasingly encountering the ecological
limits of this lovely small planet.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Looking back over the decades since World War II, it is apparent that
the social and technical context in which nation-states find themselves
has changed dramatically, but our understanding of these changes still lags
behind the reality.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Looking back much further, over the past 50,000 years of human history,
there are many indications that we are at one of those rare cultural watersheds
when a whole new cultural epoch is being born. 
</UL>
<BR>
In this article I'd like to look at these trends more closely to see what
they can tell us about what time it is. 
<H4>A CHOICE OF FUTURES</H4>
In <I>IN CONTEXT</I> #30, #31, and #32, I did a series of articles that
drew heavily on the global computer model - know as &quot;World3&quot; -
that provided the basis for <I>Beyond The Limits</I> (the book by Meadows,
Meadows, and Randers that gives wonderfully insightful descriptions of how
population growth and industrial growth are driving human society beyond
its ecological limits - highly recommended.) <I><BR>
<BR>
Figure 1</I> summarizes one of their key results by showing the growth of
world population and world average industrial output per person as calculated
by World3. From 1900 up to 1995, the curves, while generated by the computer
model, closely follow the actual historical data. Beyond 1995, they follow
two possible scenarios.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="futures.gif" WIDTH="408" HEIGHT="245" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3" ALT="A choice of futures"><BR>
<P><CENTER><I>Figure 1: Sustainable development vs. business-as-usual</I></CENTER>
<P>The dashed curves illustrate the consequences of continuing with the
same policies and assumptions that have governed global growth up to now.
The pattern of rise and fall in the curves is a cycle that system theorists
call &quot;overshoot and collapse.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
In the model, exhaustion of nonrenewable resources, degradation of renewable
resources such as soil, and the overwhelming of the environment's capacity
to assimilate society's wastes all contribute to the collapse. <I>Figure
1</I> illustrates what happens as fuels and raw materials decline in quality
and accessibility, requiring ever-increasing amounts of capital and energy
just to get them into usable form. The economy becomes trapped. It can't
provide what it used to in the way of investment in agriculture, consumer
goods, and services, and it no longer has the flexibility to invest in restructuring
itself to make better use of renewable resources. The economy thus spirals
down, pulling down agriculture and health care with it, yet still gobbling
up lots of nonrenewable resources along the way. Death rates rise dramatically
through hunger and disease, while desperate humans ravage what is left of
the world's ecosystems.<BR>
<BR>
It's not a pretty picture, and World3 doesn't even include the Yugoslavia-like
violence that could arise, or nuclear war, or a dozen other hideous scenarios
that could all too easily develop as part of the collapse.<BR>
<BR>
What can we do to avoid such a fate? We have to change the way we live.
The solid curves illustrate one way this could happen if the world were
to adopt some major, but technically possible, changes in policy and behavior
starting in 1995. These changes, as described in <I>IC </I>#31, involve
shifting to more efficient and less polluting technologies, voluntarily
limiting world industrial output, and slowing population growth.<BR>
<BR>
It is easy to see obstacles to these changes - political opposition, institutional
barriers, and so on. Yet all of these obstacles are a matter of human choice.
We are not physically or technologically prevented from making any of these
changes. And given the likely outcome from continuing with business-as-usual,
better to overcome these obstacles now than to have humankind and millions
of other species suffer the consequences.<BR>
<BR>
How seriously should we take these results from World3? The authors of <I>Beyond
The Limits</I> would be the first to insist their model is intended to provide
qualitative insights, not detailed numerical predictions. Nevertheless,
there are many signs that the world is already beginning to encounter the
kind of ecological limits the model indicates and that World3 may even be
overly optimistic (see related story below).<BR>
<BR>
<I>Figure 2</I> illustrates one particularly significant indicator. <BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="grain.gif" WIDTH="214" HEIGHT="304" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3"><BR>
<BR>
It compares the world average food supply per person as projected by World3
(essentially the same as the original 1972 projection) with actual grain
production (from <I>Vital Signs 1993</I> by Lester Brown et al.). Grain
is, of course, only part of the total food supply, but it is a major part,
and the total food supply will likely follow closely the trends in grain
production. Both curves grow, reach a peak, and then decline - and for the
same reasons. The growth comes from both increases in cropland and increases
in fertilizer, irrigation, and other agricultural inputs that can raise
crop yields. The curves stop growing and then decline because: 
<UL>
<LI>degradation of cropland (through soil erosion, conversion to urban use,
salt buildup in irrigated land, etc.) begins to outpace the addition of
new cropland<BR>
<BR>
<LI>the effectiveness of fertilizers and other inputs reaches a point of
diminishing returns<BR>
<BR>
<LI>air and water pollution cause lower crop yields. 
</UL>
<BR>
The only thing that is really different between the two curves is that the
real data peaks 10 years earlier than the World3 projection.<BR>
<BR>
Clearly, world grain production, grown largely with our present industrial
methods, appears to have already encountered ecological limits. We still
have enough agricultural capacity for the world to feed itself, and many
under-used techniques (less industrial and more biological) for maintaining
and even increasing yields, but this data should serve as a warning to take
the general outlines of <I>Figure 1</I> quite seriously.<I><BR>
<BR>
What time is it?</I> Taken together, the two figures and Robert Goodland's
accompanying story suggest that one answer is that this is the first time
in history when humanity as a whole is encountering global environmental
limits. The impact of this encounter will reverberate in profound ways throughout
all aspects of our lives. Since all of our institutions - as well as our
ways of thinking about economics, governance, war, and peace - were developed
when humankind's activities were safely small compared to the Earth's capacity,
we can expect we've got some major rethinking and restructuring to do. 
<H4>THE POST-COLD WAR ERA IS OVER</H4>
Next, let's turn our attention back over the recent past. The fixation on
the superpower contest between the US and the USSR during the 45 years or
so after World War II reinforced certain assumptions about our world: 
<UL>
<LI>It focused attention on military and ideological issues as <I>the</I>
threats to national security. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>It gave the impression that the US and the USSR were <I>the</I> significant
players on the world scene.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>More subtly, it assumed that nation-states, rather than other human
groupings, were <I>the</I> significant players on the world scene. 
</UL>
<BR>
In the waning years of the Cold War, these assumptions began to crumble
right along with the crumbling of the Soviet Bloc. We are now waking up
to discover: 
<UL>
<LI>Environmental, social, and economic problems pose at least as big a
threat to national security as military or ideological issues ever did.
Today, military violence remains a threat, not because there is the political
will for a major war, but simply because the world has so many weapons of
such destructive capability. As for ideological concerns, the past few years
make it clear that modern communications technologies - from videotapes,
to faxes, to e-mail - have made the old-style totalitarian society impractical.
In such a setting, the whole notion of &quot;national security&quot; needs
to be profoundly rethought.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>You may well have heard the observation that the winners of the Cold
War were ... Japan and Germany. I don't think life is quite that simple,
but it certainly is true that while the US and USSR were exhausting each
other through their military competition, other parts of the world were
quietly putting their efforts to more productive use. The result now is
a much more complex, multi-centric world.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Perhaps even more importantly, you could well say that the winners of
the Cold War were ... transnational organizations, particularly transnational
corporations. The real shift of power hasn't been from one set of nations
to another set, but from the nation-state to various nongovernmental organizations
and systems. Many transnational corporations have budgets larger than the
Gross National Products of many countries represented in the UN. International
financial markets now impose a discipline on governments that was unheard
of 20 years ago. Outside the economic arena, transnational citizen groups
like Amnesty International do more to set the international human rights
agenda than many nation-states do. Likewise, CNN and other international
media groups often have more influence on world opinion than national governments.
Within nations, ethnic groups often retain more loyalty than the nations
of which they are a part. 
</UL>
<BR>
What time is it? It is the end of the era when global society was essentially
defined by military rivalries between nation-states, and the start of an
era in which the global community is a rich mix of government, business,
and citizens' groups, and economic, environmental, social, and military
issues are thoroughly intertwined.<BR>
<BR>
To this I would like to add a special reflection for those of us who live
in North America, for we often seem to have a hard time comprehending how
historically unusual, how materially easy, the post-war decades have been
for most of us. North America emerged from the war as the only major industrial
area still intact, enabling it to dominate the world without half trying.
In spite of the rivalry with the USSR, the United States was, in many ways,
<I>the</I> superpower - economically, technologically, militarily, and in
popular culture.<BR>
<BR>
This position provided easy control of the world's resources, which allowed
Americans to develop many wasteful habits and create a myth that ever-increasing
consumption was a law of nature. The 1980s were a last hurrah, defiantly
upholding this myth in the face of the evidence. Now in the 1990s, we are
uncomfortably and reluctantly readjusting our expectations, although many
still hope for &quot;the next big upturn.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
There may well be another upturn, of sorts, but it won't be like the easy
growth of the 1950s and 1960s, or even like the debt-based growth of the
1980s. We need to come to grips with the fact that many of the advantages
the US inherited by default after World War II are now ebbing away.<I><BR>
<BR>
What time is it?</I> It is a time when Americans will have to become just
another part of the world in a way to which we have not been accustomed.
The result could be wonderful. 
<H4>THE BIG PICTURE</H4>
All of these answers to &quot;What time is it?&quot; fit comfortably within
a much larger historical process. Back in <I>IC</I> #12 (Winter 1985), I
described human history as comprised of three major cultural periods, separated
by two transitions:<BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="HistArrw.gif" WIDTH="426" HEIGHT="86" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3" ALT="Arrow of History"><BR>
<BR>
The first period, up to about 10,000 years ago, was tribal, based on hunting
and gathering. (This dating is, by necessity, very rough and refers only
to the leading edge of cultural evolution. Obviously, many tribal cultures
continued to exist, and even thrive, during the past 10,000 years, but they
were no longer at the leading edge of human cultural evolution.) It was
a remarkably successful, sustainable cultural mode so long as human populations
were small.<BR>
<BR>
The next major period I call the Age of Empire, in full dominance from about
5,000 years ago to about 500 years ago. The cultures in this period were
characteristically city-based military empires with agriculture as the economic
base. These cultures were clearly different from the earlier tribal cultures
and can be thought of as the empire <I>family</I> of cultures.<BR>
<BR>
The third major period, which hasn't come into full expression yet but could
do so as early as some time in the 21st century, I call the Planetary Era.
I suggest, in the <A HREF="HistOtln.htm">accompanying chart</A>, some of
the characteristics this era might have (see <I>IC</I> #12 for more discussion).
I expect that it will also be made up of a family of cultures, as different
from those of the Age of Empire as these were from the Tribal Era.<BR>
<BR>
This outline of history suggests another answer to &quot;What time is it?&quot;
for it says we are in the later part of the transition between the Empire
and Planetary periods. If this is so, we can perhaps get some useful perspective
on our own time by looking back at the transition between the Tribal and
Empire periods (from about 10,000 years ago to about 5,000 years ago).<BR>
<BR>
That transition began with agriculture and settled village life, which in
turn lead to considerable population growth. For a long time, however, these
Neolithic villages retained the old tribal social structure based on clans.
Yet eventually the increased wealth, population, and technological capabilities
of these cultures provided more social complexity than could be managed
within the old social structures. Someone then discovered that it was economically
viable to herd people instead of cattle, and with the help of the new tools
of writing and the images of powerful, universal sky gods, the &quot;warlord&quot;
system ousted the old clan-based system.<BR>
<BR>
We can see in this transition a pattern of cultural change: 
<UL>
<LI>driven first by new technologies and means of livelihood<BR>
<BR>
<LI>accelerated by population growth<BR>
<BR>
<LI>opened to social change by new opportunities that come with new technologies
and changing social conditions<BR>
<BR>
<LI>brought to a crisis by the inability of the old social order to manage
the new complexity<BR>
<BR>
<LI>resolved by the arising of new social institutions capable of handling
that complexity. 
</UL>
<BR>
Moving ahead to our own transition during the past 500 years, we can see
at least parts of a similar pattern. The start of Western science and the
rise of commerce during the Renaissance initiated a technological/economic
process that has been a major driver of cultural change ever since. Population
growth has followed in its wake, accelerating the change away from the old
conditions in which the Empire Era cultures flourished.<BR>
<BR>
The slowest area of change has been the move away from the social institutions
characteristic of the Age of Empire, again matching the pattern. It is only
in the 20th century that democracy has replaced authoritarian rule to any
broad extent, and one of the most important institutions of today - the
corporation - is still non-democratic. <BR>
<BR>
We are now at a point where: 
<UL>
<LI>Our encounters with the ecological limits of the Earth are providing
a looming challenge for which our present social, economic, and governance
institutions are ill suited.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>The enormous destructive power of modern weapons and the fragile interconnected
character of industrial society have made warfare no longer the viable economic
strategy it was during the Age of Empire. The trend, most visible since
World War II and still far from complete, is away from war as a means of
gain through conquest and toward other forms of international dispute resolution.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>The power of modern communications and travel technologies is making
authoritarian institutions increasingly difficult to run. Indeed, I would
argue that the collapse of the Soviet Bloc is best understood as the victory
of decentralism rather than the victory of capitalism. The waning of large,
centralized organizations is also clear in the business world, where company
after company is finding ways to collapse its hierarchy and decentralize
its operations.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Modern communications and travel are also shifting the sense of community
and loyalty away from local geographic groups to non-geographic &quot;communities
of interest.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<LI>The nation-state is sharing more and more of its power with business
and citizen groups. 
</UL>
<BR>
If our present transition continues to follow the same pattern as the earlier
one, we should be close to the point where the complexity of our times is
overwhelming the ability of the old institutions to cope (sound familiar?).
This long-term historical perspective thus invites us to re-invent our social
institutions at a far more profound level than we are normally accustomed
to doing. At the same time, our need to avoid &quot;overshoot and collapse&quot;
is urging us to do so as well. If this whole analysis is correct, such re-invention
is indeed <I>the</I> task of our time.<I><BR>
<BR>
What time is it?</I> It is time to create the new cultural, social, economic,
and governance institutions for the Planetary Era. 
<H4>IT'S THE SYSTEM ... </H4>
In its broadest scope, this is the territory <I>IN CONTEXT</I> has been
exploring for more than a decade. In this issue, we focus particularly on
the critical interplay between economics and governance in a global context.<BR>
<BR>
Earlier I listed three areas - technology, industrial output, and population
- in which change needs to occur to move us toward a sustainable future.
Implementing change in any of these areas is a complex, multi-faceted social
challenge, yet woven through all of them is the strong - and currently counter-productive
- role played by the economic system.<BR>
<BR>
As we begin this issue, it will be helpful to explore why our present economic
system is not producing sustainable results. To do so, we need to distinguish
between the economy as a physical process and as an information system.<BR>
<BR>
As a physical process, the economy is a system of producing, distributing,
and using various goods and services. This process is clearly an interconnected
part - a subsystem - of all human activity, which in turn is a subsystem
of the natural world. Physical economic activity affects, and is affected
by, these larger systems in highly interdependent ways.<BR>
<BR>
As an information system, the connection is much weaker. Our market economy
gets its rules from various laws and social norms which define what are
legal and acceptable business practices. Then it guides people with the
signal of price as they choose how to allocate their scarce resources. Unfortunately,
there is a great deal of important information, particularly about society
and the environment, that is not included - or is misrepresented - in prices.
<BR>
<BR>
For example, if the full social and environmental cost of driving were included
in the cost of gasoline, reasonable estimates are that we should be paying
at least $7 per gallon (see <I>IC</I> #33, page 9). We pay all that cost
now, of course, but indirectly through taxes, health insurance, damaged
lives, and fragmented communities. We don't get to see the connection directly,
nor do we get the full benefit when we make wiser choices.<BR>
<BR>
This kind of distortion is pervasive throughout our pricing system both
because of the failure to include social and environmental costs and because
of all kinds of tax-based subsidies. In effect, the whole system is rigged
- for the benefit of today's generation, of certain groups of people, and
of certain favored industries.<BR>
<BR>
With this distorted pricing, our present economic system attempts to operate
in a world of its own, as unaffected as possible by the larger human and
ecological systems in which it is physically embedded, with its only imperative
being its own growth.<BR>
<BR>
In biological systems, subsystems that ignore their surroundings and concentrate
only on their own growth are known as parasites or cancers. Unfortunately,
in its present form, our economic system is the cultural and ecological
equivalent of a cancer that, if not transformed, will kill its host in a
few short decades.<BR>
<BR>
If we are instead to get the economy to produce sustainable results, we
will need to get its information side to be as closely interconnected with
the surrounding social-ecological system as its physical side is. Such an
economic system should, among other things, guide its various players to
select activities with the greatest net long-term value for the whole. This
would be helped by, for example: 
<UL>
<LI>full-cost accounting that brings into the price system all the social
and environmental costs associated with the complete life-cycle of a product
or service<BR>
<BR>
<LI>patient capital that invests in the long-term<BR>
<BR>
<LI>job flexibility that enables a meaningful choice as to how people allocate
their time between the marketplace and the rest of life. 
</UL>
<BR>
While there are technical challenges here, they are not nearly as daunting
as the political challenges, for these changes would involve adopting, and
enforcing, significant new &quot;rules of the game.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
There are at least two levels of political challenge. First, political jurisdictions
(e.g. nations) need to be willing to redo the &quot;rules of the game&quot;
for the economic activity within their jurisdiction. Second, any jurisdiction
that does so needs to be able to control the impact, via trade and the movement
of capital, from businesses outside the jurisdiction who are playing by
different rules.<BR>
<BR>
Neither of these steps look particularly easy, but trade and the movement
of capital form a particularly thorny problem. Consider what would happen
if all the nations of the world except one were to adopt ecologically and
socially responsible rules of the game, while the one dissenter allowed
its businesses to &quot;externalize&quot; and ignore social and environmental
costs. If there was free trade among countries, the businesses from that
one country could presumably out compete those of the other countries. If
there was also free movement of capital, many businesses in the other countries
would move to the one &quot;low-cost&quot; country.<BR>
<BR>
Thus, not only do the rules of the game need to be determined <I>within</I>
nations, they need to be determined <I>among </I>nations.<BR>
<BR>
All of these issues are questions of <I>governance</I>, that is, the overall
process by which society determines and enforces its rules. Governance encompasses
more than just government, for it includes the interplay among government,
business, citizens' groups, the press, and the public at large. Because
these issues involve many geographic scales - local, national, and global
- they also present us with the challenge of getting governance to work
on all these scales.<BR>
<BR>
Pulling all these threads together suggests that developing a humane and
sustainable society for the Planetary Era will require changing the rules
that govern our economic and governance systems so that we get the relationships
right among: 
<UL>
<LI>economic activity, community, and the environment<BR>
<BR>
<LI>economic activities between different communities, i.e. the rules of
trade<BR>
<BR>
<LI>governance at various scales of community - local, national, and global.
</UL>
<BR>
As overwhelming as this may all seem, the articles in this issue illustrate
that this complex territory may turn out to be more friendly than you might
suspect. There are more than glimmers on the road ahead!<BR>

</H4>
<BR>
Welcome to <I>IN CONTEXT</I> #44, our first purely on-line issue. The new
format opens up fascinating opportunities and, indeed, has changed our basic
understand of what it means to &quot;publish.&quot; I'd like to share this
shift with you so you can have a better sense of what to expect.<BR>
<BR>
To understand our shift of paradigm, bear with me while I describe two different
approaches to education: 
<UL>
  <LI>The <B>curriculum-based</B> approach, in which an expert group decides
what the students should learn and in what order they should learn it.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>The <B>library-based</B> approach, in which the learner decides which
learning resources to tap and in which order. 
</UL>
To some extent they each incorporate the other, since curriculum-based schools
usually have libraries, and you could say that the books in a library are
like mini-curricula. Nevertheless, their priorities are different. I feel
both approaches have their place, but once you have learned <I>how</I> to
learn, the library approach tends to be a much more efficient way to learn.<BR>
<BR>
How does this apply to publishing? I'm chagrined to admit that it wasn't
until late 1995 that I &quot;got&quot; that a printed periodical is the
direct analogue of a curriculum (the editorial group decides what the readers
should see and in what sequence) while a web site is the analogue of a library.<BR>
<BR>
Yet a web site can also be much more, for it can be interactive in way that
most libraries and their contents aren't.<BR>
<BR>
Thus, during the summer of 1996 (July, August, September), this &quot;issue&quot;
will be more a process than a thing. What you will find on-line now is its
<I>beginning</I> with only a start on its contents rather than a completed
issue.<BR>
<BR>
This start includes: 
<UL>
  <LI>an article I've written on <A HREF="Attune.htm">Attuning to the Future</A>
that includes a special poll in which I'd like you to participate 
  <LI>a <A HREF="TOC44.htm#bundle">group</A> of 12 articles by the visionary
architect Tom Bender 
  <LI><A HREF="TOC44.htm#reviews">a book review and a magazine review</A>
</UL>
<BR>
I invite you to join in this process by sending <A HREF="mailto:rcgilman@context.org">me</A>:
<UL>
  <LI>comments on what is already in the issue 
  <LI>articles and suggestions for articles 
  <LI>reviews and suggestions for reviews of books, magazines, websites,
videos, groups, etc. 
</UL>
<BR>
I have to give you the editor's caveat: we will, as you might expect, use
only a portion of the material and suggestions that are sent to us. But
don't let that discourage you. Everything that is sent influences us and
the evolution of this site.<BR>
<BR>
So, please enjoy the evolving issue, contribute to it if you feel so moved,
and help us develop this site into a world-class contribution toward a humane
and sustainable future.<BR>

<HR><BR>
<BR>
Last August I facilitated a process for the <A HREF="http://www.gaia.org/findhorn/">Findhorn
Community</A> which, in keeping with the Findhorn way of doing things, I
called &quot;Attuning to the Future.&quot; The immediate justification was
to help them with some land-use planning, but the deeper purpose was to
help them better understand their own orientation, as a community, towards
the future. It all took place in an afternoon workshop attended by about
30 community members, including most of the leadership of the community.<BR>
<BR>
In this article I would like to share the essence of this process, ... and
elicit your feedback (more on how to do this later). 
<H4><BR>
THE PROCESS</H4>
The basic approach is like the scenario-based management training approach
used by companies like Shell Oil. In this approach, you, as a participant,
are given a scenario for a possible global future and then asked to describe
how you would function in that setting.<BR>
<BR>
In Findhorn's case, I went through the following cycle four times, each
time with a different possible future.<BR>
<BR>
Each cycle began with a guided visualization: 
<UL>
  <LI>The visualization starts with my telling the story of how this particular
future developed over the next ten years.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Then, still in the visualization, I asked the participants to imagine
how (through what activities) the community might best fulfill its mission
in the context of this scenario.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Finally, because this was a land-use planning exercise, I asked them
to imagine walking around the community and seeing the kind of buildings
and land-use that would ideally support these activities. 
</UL>
<BR>
After each visualization we got quick statements from the participant about
what they had imagined, listing these on newsprint without discussion. These
lists provided useful input for those doing the land-use planning and provided
others in the community with a graphic demonstration of community the diversity
of community visions.<BR>
<BR>
What were the scenarios? I call the four scenarios &quot;More of the Same,&quot;
&quot;Disaster and Collapse,&quot; &quot;Eco-tech Triumph,&quot; and &quot;Transformation
of Consciousness.&quot; While there are many scenarios that could be used,
these were chosen: 
<UL>
  <LI>for their contrast 
  <LI>to provide a good balance between being 
  <UL>
    <LI>challenging and insight provoking and 
    <LI>at least somewhat plausible 
  </UL>
  <LI>for their relevance to the group's concerns. 
</UL>
<BR>
The scenarios were also not meant to be &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad,&quot;
rather each has its pluses and minus, its challenges and opportunities.<BR>
<BR>
Here is how each are characterized:<BR>
<BR>
<B>More of the Same:</B> The central characteristic of this future is that
the past turns out to be a good guide to the future, at least in the sense
of straight-line extrapolations from the past. This doesn't mean that you
or your organization or community do not change, but rather that the context
in which you find yourself in the future is sufficiently similar to what
you see around you today that assuming &quot;business-as-usual&quot; works
just fine.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Disaster and Collapse:</B> In this future, &quot;business-as-usual&quot;
doesn't work at all. Indeed, in this future various natural and human calamities
have effectively swept away most of the major familiar economic and governmental
institutions, significantly reduced the world population, and focused the
lives of the survivors at a simpler, more local level.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Eco-tech Triumph:</B> Starting with a breakthrough in the cost of solar
(photovoltaic) cells, this scenario develops a future in which many of the
technical and institutional ideas about a humane and sustainable society
that we've described in <I>IN CONTEXT</I> get put into practice -- and they
actually work! The problems of both the environment and the economy are
solved and the world is set firmly on a course towards full sustainability.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Transformation of Consciousness:</B> The essence of this scenario is
that the social consensus as to the meaning of life changes at a sufficiently
deep level so that the moral/philosophical legitimacy for our present social,
economic, and governmental institutions is withdrawn. One example of how
this could get started would be if there was simultaneously: 
<UL>
  <LI>a substantial growth in the number of people who had (and <I>recognized</I>
they had) significant intuitive and/or extra-sensory perceptions, and<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>a mainstream recognition of the validity of those scientific experiments
and studies which indicate that consciousness is not tied to matter. 
</UL>
This could then evolve into a consensus worldview that saw this human life
as just part of a much larger journey of consciousness, and &quot;success&quot;
in this life as generally having little to do with today's materialist goals
of wealth, power, and the avoidance/denial of death.<BR>
<BR>
We could have stopped once we had completed the cycle for each of the four
scenarios, but I couldn't resist adding another step to the process. I asked
everyone in the group to come up with four numbers, from 0 to 10, representing
how <I>important</I> they felt each of these scenarios would be in the <I>actual</I>
future (with 10 for very important, 0 for not at all). This was done in
the spirit of recognizing that, given the complexity of real life, the actual
future was unlikely to be a pure case of any one of these, but might well
involve some blend. It was also <I>not</I> a question of what you <I>wanted</I>,
but rather what intuitively, or in your gut, you felt was most <I>likely</I>
to really happen.<BR>
<BR>
I won't tell you the results, other than to say that it was rather eye-opening
for the community to see their internal diversity in this way. 
<H4><BR>
YOUR TURN</H4>
I have a few requests:<BR>
<BR>
Please send me your rankings, from 0 to 10, for how likely you consider
each of the above four scenarios over, say, the next 20 years. I'll compile
your responses (not attached to names) and post them once we have enough
of a sample to be interesting.<BR>
<BR>
Please send me your thoughts on the four scenarios. How would you tell the
story, in as plausible a way as possible, of how any one of these scenarios
might develop? What are the challenges and opportunities that you see connected
with any of these scenarios, especially what might be some of the surprising
pluses and minuses? What other substantially different scenarios should
be considered? I'll post these responses as a <A HREF="ATFresps.htm">forum</A>.<BR>
<BR>
Looking forward to hearing from you!<BR>

<H4><CENTER><I>by <A HREF="../../PEOPLE/Bender.htm">Tom Bender</A></I></CENTER>

<B><BR>
</B>I've worked the last twenty-five years on developing parts of what is
now called &quot;Eco-design&quot;, under the belief that healthier buildings,
lower energy use, and less ecological impact was important. This was only
to discover recently that all this time I was still looking at things in
isolation rather in their ecological interconnectedness!<BR>
<BR>
What I didn't see was that every dollar a person saves on energy use in
a building is somehow spent on something else - vacations, a new car, an
education, or just paying the bills. As those same dollars ripple around
the economy, they end up using up similar amounts of energy and resources
as before. Shifts from energy-intensive to less energy intensive expenditures
<I>do</I> reduce energy use, but by only the net difference. Some alternatives,
such as vacations, can be <I>more</I> energy-intensive. And second-tier
expenditures narrow the gap further. The only apparent out seems to be earning
less or investing in renewable resources. And after working to cut in half
the use of wood in a building (and equivalently the ecological impact of
logging) we find that in one generation of growth we're cutting <I>twice</I>
as many trees to build twice as many, twice as large houses. <BR>
<BR>
All these connections lead back to our base cultural values of greed, growth,
and violence. Until we let loose of our insane belief that geometric expansion
of our numbers and our appetites can continue in a finite world, <I>any</I>
&quot;eco-building&quot; is only a band-aid. True &quot;eco-building&quot;
involves <I>whether</I> we build as well as <I>how</I>, and the values from
which we work. It <I>is</I>, however, possible to let go of the values of
greed, growth, and violence. And doing so, we discover many unexpected benefits.
(See my 1996<I> </I><A HREF="Skin.htm"><I>&quot;Shedding A Skin That No
Longer Fits&quot;</I> </A>for more detail on the whys and the hows of letting
go, and the wonderful but unfamiliar benefits of a sustainable society.)<BR>
<BR>
We discover first that stabilizing growth has immense monetary, resource,
and personal advantages. <B><I>It <U>totally avoids</U> our current expenditure
of 33% to 40% of our time and resources spent on creating the infrastructure
to accommodate more people and things.</I></B> A detailed study of these
costs would be valuable. We can estimate at this time at least a doubling
to tripling of all of society's capital expenditures, plus a 50% increase
in consumptive expenditures, for <I>population</I> doubling alone, without
counting expansion in consumption.<B> </B>A population doubling means duplicating
our entire stock of houses, water systems, power plants, cities, roads -
as well as prematurely demolishing existing ones. It also means spending
more on feeding and educating those additional people to adulthood.<BR>
<BR>
Growth has been claimed as necessary &quot;to help the poor&quot; - as if
growth over the last twenty years hasn't dramatically <I>worsened</I> the
condition of the poor and heightened the concentration of our wealth among
the rich. (See, for example, Keith Bradsher's <I>&quot;Gulf widens between
wealthy and poor&quot;</I>, New York Times News Service, April 20, 1995.)
The median US household income for wage-earners is currently $31,000, with
more than 13% of households under the monetary poverty level of $15,000.
A fully equitable distribution of personal income would amount to $59,000
per household.<BR>
<BR>
An equitable society could totally eliminate poverty and support EVERYONE
at the current median income level of $31,000 per household. <B><I>To do
so would, surprisingly, need 47% <U>less</U> work, [see also <A HREF="../IC37/Smith.htm">&quot;Wasted
Time, Wasted Wealth&quot;</A>] and equivalently fewer resources than our
current society uses to maintain poverty and inequality!</I></B><BR>
<BR>
To achieve growth, we have also developed the habit of paying for personal
expenditures, corporate expansion, and governmental infrastructure consistently
through debt purchasing. <B><I>That debt purchasing has resulted in an across-the-board
20% surcharge on our cost of living</I></B>, without any substantive benefit.
For example, interest paid on national debt in 1994 equaled 20.3% of federal
outlays (with no capital repayment). Consumer credit outstanding in 1994
equaled $985 billion - 19.9% of disposable personal income and 17% of national
income - roughly equally between auto, home, and revolving credit. Finance,
and related fields constituted 22% of national income. (For more detail
on the illusory benefits of these financial shell-games, see my 1993 <I><A HREF="Borrow.htm">&quot;Borrowing
Trouble&quot;</A></I>, 1990 <I><A HREF="Endgame.htm">&quot;Endgames&quot;</A>,</I>
and <I>&quot;Hidden Costs of Housing&quot;</I>.)<BR>
<BR>
Together, stabilizing growth and dealing directly with the inequality in
our society can &lt;U&gt;permanently&lt;/U&gt; release us from almost 75%
of our present energy, material, financial and human costs of living, without
lowering our material living standard, and without need for any &quot;technical
fixes&quot;. (For further discussion of <I>how</I> to achieve these benefits,
see my 1996 <I><A HREF="Unasked.htm">&quot;Some Questions We Haven't Asked&quot;</A></I>.)
<B><I>Said another way, GREED AND GROWTH ALONE CURRENTLY <U>QUADRUPLE</U>
OUR COST OF LIVING!</I></B> <BR>
<BR>
Our belief in an endless cornucopia of resources and wealth has also caused
us to ignore care and efficiency in all of our institutional structures,
production processes, and living patterns. The result is that they have
developed almost inconceivable waste - which now represents an equally great
opportunity for improved effectiveness and efficiency. (For some of the
other non-technical, big-jump opportunities, see <I><A HREF="Unasked.htm">&quot;Some
Questions We Haven't Asked&quot;</A>.</I>)<BR>
<BR>
Well-documented research over the last twenty years has shown and is beginning
to produce &lt;U&gt;factor of ten&lt;/U&gt; savings (90% reduction) in energy
and resources needed in almost every sector of society: 
<UL>
  <LI>This means two hundred mile-per-gallon cars, safer than today's, and
totally recyclable. They're due on the road in four to five years. (Best
resources are the many progress reports of the <A HREF="http://www.rmi.org/">Rocky
Mountain Institute</A>.) 
  <LI>Even greater magnitudes are possible in public transportation systems.
(For a small piece, see my <I><A HREF="Rentall.htm">&quot;Rentalls: A Key
to Successful Transportation Systems&quot;</A></I>. ) 
  <LI>It means homes that require only sunlight and rainfall to operate.
(See, for example, work of the <A HREF="http://www.maxpot.com/">Center for
Maximum Potential Building Systems</A> and the Rocky Mountain Institute.)
Prototypes are already in operation in almost all of our climate zones.
  <LI>Water?.....today's toilets and showers already have reduced water
use 75% from fixtures of only a few years ago - and more improvements are
on the way. (Note in particular <A HREF="../IC35/Guterson.htm">John Todd's
work with biological water purification</A> .) 
  <LI>Forestry practices are available now - requiring no new technology
- that maintain <I>all</I> forests in old growth condition, while doubling
timber production, increasing the economic benefits from timber production
nine-fold, and increasing total forest value many times more. (See my 1994<I>
<A HREF="Forest.htm">&quot;Improving the Economic Value of Coastal Public
Forest Lands&quot;</A></I>. )<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>How about a higher education system with resources available - <I>free</I>
<I>to all, worldwide - </I>via satellite TV? (See my 1993 <I><A HREF="Vitality.htm">&quot;Vitality
and Affordability of Higher Education&quot;</A></I>.) 
  <LI>Housing that costs only one-tenth of today's, through improved durability,
energy efficiency and financing patterns? (See my <I>&quot;Hidden Costs
of Housing&quot;,</I> RAIN, Utne Reader, Sun Times, Alternative Press Annual,
1984.) 
  <LI>Industrial products with virtually zero ecological impact and magnitude
lower production costs? (See Amory Lovins, NATURAL CAPITALISM, 1996.) 
</UL>
<BR>
All these and more are immanent or already being implemented today. &quot;Eco-building&quot;
(or &quot;eco-adapting&quot;, as we need much less new building under such
conditions) is clearly an important element of improving the effectiveness
and efficiency of our systems - <I>once we deal <U>first</U> with the basic
causes of instability in our society.<BR>
<BR>
</I>When we put just these four opportunities together, they add up to ways
to reduce our resource consumption, ecological impact, and use of our time
<I>by up to 97%, </I>which is significantly more than appears needed to
achieve sustainablilty ... and the <I>real</I> rewards of a sustainable
society do not fall in these familiar material dimensions of life. (See,
for example, <I><A HREF="Skin.htm">&quot;Shedding A Skin...&quot;</A></I>
above, my 1993 <I><A HREF="Wealth.htm">&quot;Building Real Wealth&quot;</A></I>,
and <I><A HREF="Tourism.htm">&quot;Transforming Tourism&quot;</A></I>, Earth
Ethics, Summer 1993. For values, see my <I>&quot;Sharing Smaller Pies&quot;</I>,
New Age Journal, Nov. 1975; The Futurist, 1976; RESETTLING AMERICA, Gary
Coates, ed. 1981, and Utne Reader, Fall 1987.)<BR>
<BR>
It is unlikely that we would ever follow such possibilities out to these
extremes - if for no other reason that we decide we <I>want</I> to work
more, or we <I>want</I> to do better for ourselves and all life, and ask
for higher levels of performance in all we do. But even if we decide to
only achieve two-thirds of each of these savings, that still adds up to
an 82% reduction from our present patterns - almost exactly what is projected
by preliminary Friends of the Earth studies on European and U.S. economies
to be needed to operate on a sustainable basis. (See also Bill Rees' excellent
<I>&quot;Ecological Footprints and Appropriated Carrying Capacity...&quot;</I>
in INVESTING IN NATURAL CAPITAL, <A HREF="http://www.islandpress.com/">Island
Press</A> 1994, or <I>&quot;Revising Carrying Capacity...&quot;</I> in Population
and Environment: A Journal of Interdisciplinary Studies, Jan 1996.)<BR>
<BR>
We've also looked at these issues very briefly and in isolation. In reality
they are interactive. Some give resource savings but not financial or employment
ones. Others, as in any ecological system, have multiple and interactive
effects and savings. (See Amory Lovins, <I>&quot;The Super-Efficient Passive
Building Frontier&quot;</I>, ASHRAE Journal, June 1995 for an outstanding
example of the interactive and cumulative benefits of energy efficiency
in minimizing building operating costs.) Hours worked would drop significantly,
but unlikely to the equivalent 12 minutes a day, as these alternatives are
often more employment intensive. <B><I>What is important is that the savings
possible are far more than enough to totally transform a once frightening
prospect of change into an opportunity for significant betterment of our
lives!</I></B> <BR>
<BR>
One of the curious twists of ecological interconnectedness here is that
proceeding with implementing these efficiency improvements (such as eco-building)
without first dealing with growth and our other base values can turn out
scarily counterproductive. It would result with us twenty-five years down
the road having twice the population, fewer resources, and having already
used up the opportunities for releasing resources out of our operating patterns
to finance a transition to sustainability.<BR>
<BR>
There <I>is</I> an urgency to this issue. (See, for example, L.F. Ivanhoe's
<I>&quot;Future World Oil Supplies; there is a finite limit&quot;</I>, World
Oil, Oct., 1995 on global oil and population trends, and Richard Duncan's
1995 <I>&quot;The Energy Depletion Arch...&quot;</I> on U.S. and global
oil depletion.) Ivanhoe also interestingly touches on the falsification
beginning to occur in government statistical studies as our denial of resource
depletion becomes more acute. The likelihood of major reduction in our material
quality of life would then be immense.<BR>
<BR>
Does that mean we should stop trying to improve the ecological fitness of
our building? That would seem crazy. What I think it means is that we hold
such building up <I>as an example</I> of <I><U>just one</U> </I>of the benefits
of stabilizing growth, and explain the others. That we add to the technical
aspect of eco-building the human, psychological, and spiritual dimensions
that give us connectedness with the rest of creation, places with souls,
gardens to nurture our spirits, and cities of passion. (For more detail,
see my 1994 <I><A HREF="Heart.htm">&quot;The Spiritual Heart of Sustainable
Communities&quot;</A>.</I>) And along side, to put as much or greater effort
into helping us all become aware of and achieve <I>all</I> the benefits
of stabilizing growth and becoming a sustainable society. (See my discussion
of the human, psychological, community, and spiritual dimensions of sustainable
design and building in my 1993 THE HEART OF PLACE, and 1995 <I><A HREF="Sewage.htm">&quot;Sewage
is Art: A Study of the Healing of Place with &quot;Chi&quot;</A></I>.)<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Such a commonplace thing, it would be surprising if we did notice.
Menus in restaurants. Ads in newspapers. Price tags in grocery stores -
even at Goodwill. Yet it is still amazing that we do not rebel, or at least
harbor an inner anger, at the oddness those prices truly convey.<BR>
<BR>
I was in a small greengrocer's in Kyoto a couple of years ago when it suddenly
struck me how unusual it was that all the prices in that store were in simple
round numbers: '500 yen for 200 grams', instead of the '11-3/4 oz. cans
for only $3.99' pricing which I'd become accustomed to in grocery stores
at home. Simple prices - a gift to make shoppers' decisions easy, in contrast
to a trick to cause unwise choices.<BR>
<BR>
It dawned on me then how utterly ubiquitous the value of deceit has become
in our society, how frightening our unnoticing acceptance of it is, and
how EVERY detail of our lives will need to change to have a society in which
we honor each other and work for the good of all.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="30%"></CENTER>
<P><I>ENOUGH </I>IS ENOUGH<BR>
<BR>
It's time to shed this skin that no longer fits. It's time to shed the deceit,
the greed, the violence, the self-centeredness, the separateness that has
made us and our world an unhappy place. It's time to let it fall away. It's
time to let the caring, sharing, giving, loving, honoring which really supports
and brings happiness, connectedness, and meaning to our lives be restored
their rightful place in the full light of day.<BR>
<BR>
Everything we do embodies and reflects our basic values like a mirror. Yet
like the deceit inherent in our culture's typical pricing practices, those
deepest beliefs and values of our culture are so pervasive and so deeply
ingrained that they are normally invisible. They are so surrounded by deep
fears and dependence that it is extremely hard to make them visible and
evaluate them. <BR>
<BR>
Yet it seems vital today to find a way to bring those basic beliefs into
consciousness and examine them carefully. They have brought us unnecessarily
to a situation where the odds are quickly mounting against our very survival.
I pray we can do better than that.<BR>
<P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="30%"></CENTER>
<P><B><I>* We believed we were exempt from the laws of nature.</I></B><BR>
<BR>
Separating ourselves from the rest of creation and deluding ourselves that
we are exempt from the laws of nature is harmful to both ourselves and the
rest of life. The distinction of separateness we draw at the boundary of
our skins is as harmful as the skin of cultural beliefs and values that
focus our perceptions, lives, and society in ways bad for our well-being
and survival.<BR>
<BR>
Life feeds life. Creation goes on forever. Life evolves. Diversity is wealth,
stability, and survival. A part of life cannot become the whole of it. The
universe is not boundless. This we cannot, and should not even wish to,
escape.<BR>
<P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="30%"></CENTER>
<P><B><I>* We believed in the possibility and value of unlimited expansion
in our numbers, desires, and consumption.</I></B><BR>
<BR>
Unbounded desires, exponential growth in numbers and consumption, and seeking
success only in those increases can not be met in a world of shrinking resources.
Limitlessness can't be achieved or even sought in a finite material world.
Such concepts violate the basic laws of nature, mathematics, and human character.
Strong evidence exists that we may have already exceeded the limits of sustainability.
Why do we need more of us? <BR>
<BR>
If anything other than a root belief of our own culture, we would judge
such a belief totally insane. Or is it a conscious attempt to deceive those
we are taking from into believing the possibility that 'more' will trickle
down to everyone?<BR>
<BR>
Even our economics has no way of saying &quot;enough&quot;.<BR>
<P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="30%"></CENTER>
<P><B><I>* We believed in the right to take without constraint from other
life and people to achieve our personal ambitions and our thoughtless increase
in numbers</I></B><I>.</I><BR>
<BR>
Limitless taking from the rest of nature and other people for our own boundless
wants and funneling the entire capabilities of the planet into a purposeless
expansion of our numbers is not possible. It already is resulting in the
annihilation of entire species, and destabilizing of complex ecosystems
and global processes. Such taking creates ever more unstable and less resilient
economic, social, and ecological systems. It is consuming our future, eating
our seed corn, spending our capital. It is waging war with life itself,
and destroying creation.<BR>
<BR>
Our job is not to consume the world.<BR>
<P><CENTER>***</CENTER>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We relate to the world outside our skin as something separate
from us - 'others', the 'environment'. Yet there is no way we can be separate
from the health of what surrounds us; from the air, food, life, and energy
that we draw back and forth across that boundary of &quot;our skin&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
The world was not created for us - we are part of it. As much as we are
'humans', we are also an incredibly complex group culture that mitochondria
have developed. We are the technological innovation of rock to transport
itself and give it a particular perception and voice. We are a creation
of plants to transform the toxic oxygen wastes they release into the air
back into the carbon dioxide they need for photosynthesis. <BR>
<BR>
We are as well a beautiful element in the conscious body of a planet, and
a local &quot;standing wave&quot; vortex in the energy song that generates
nodes of complexity in local regions of the universe. We can see ourselves
in many ways as part of nature, life, and creation. What we cannot do is
to continue to see ourselves as something APART from nature and outside
of its rules.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="30%"></CENTER>
<H4><BR>
BAD DREAMS</H4>
Together, our root values of greed and growth underlie most of the damage
and ills of our world. Coming out of a long period where the limits to our
numbers and appetites were distant enough as to appear &quot;unlimited&quot;,
it is understandable in part how they have developed. Their continuance
in a period where both the directionality and the magnitude of our material
demands clearly violates the laws of nature is totally a different situation.<BR>
<BR>
Some still dream that we will discover ways to evade the laws of nature.
Yet more than fifty years of concerted effort has failed to provide <I>any</I>
significant reason to believe, for example, that a &quot;universal, free,
energy source&quot; is on the horizon. Rather, the purported solutions,
such as nuclear power or oil shale, have turned out to be unmitigated fiscal,
scientific, and ecological disasters.<BR>
<BR>
With that record, the burden of proof must clearly be on anyone who asserts
we have any right or reason to exceed our sustainable limits. Sanity lies
in living within our proven means until or unless such a point is reached
where it can be conclusively show that those boundaries have expanded.<BR>
<BR>
In reality, almost noone believes in the dogma of unlimited growth, greed,
and self-centeredness anymore. Even the voices of its wildest proponents
now sound hollow and have had to shift from arguing limits to just pretending
that limits don't exist. The evidence of ecological limits, social and psychological
damage, institutional costs, and even financial costs has become too incontrovertible
to resist. What remains is that we can see the means and value of the changes
necessary clearly enough that we can acknowledge their need and commit to
their achievement.<BR>
<BR>
After a point, &quot;<I>more</I>&quot; becomes a heavy load.<BR>
<P><CENTER>***</CENTER>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Admit it. The ads, the glitter and glory - they'll never give
us what they promise. A beautiful woman or a handsome man. The promise of
a passionate evening. The feel of success and confidence. Power. Freedom.<BR>
<BR>
Someone will always have more. All we get is the overpriced lingerie we
never will wear, the cigarettes and throat cancer, the temperamental car
- and the bills. <BR>
<BR>
Sensuality and passion do have wonderful power - enough to distract us,
send our other senses adrift, and draw our attention from almost anything
else. But does a culture of 'sensual' advertising give to us or take away
from us?<BR>
<BR>
We aren't just being conned into buying spark plugs while that beautiful
woman is on our mind. We're having the whole wonder and beauty of sex, love,
passion, and beauty perverted, corrupted, debased into a tool to deceive
us yet again. They're stealing our soul as well as our money, our work,
and our dreams, and tainting all the real power of life. It's too high a
price. If they could give us the universe, they would still be at least
36c short of a fair deal. <BR>
<BR>
Let fantasies be fantasies. <I>That</I> is their beauty!</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4><BR>
THE INNER REWARDS OF MADNESS</H4>
The external costs of greed and growth are crippling, and growing daily.
But these costs are overshadowed by the towering and ignored inner costs
to our hearts and spirits of living those values. Excess material wealth
and numbers, inequity, and unconcern for the rest of life poison our souls.
Taking from rather than caring for others destroys our hearts. Closing ourselves
off from the pain we cause loses us the connectedness that gives life meaning.
It sentences us to a life of psychological and emotional barrenness and
meaningless existence. <BR>
<BR>
Our most daunting and seemingly unconnected social problems stem directly
from following the beacons of greed and growth. Unemployment, drug addiction,
abuse; crime, obesity, mental and psychological problems - are all common
symptoms of a cultural <I>disease of the spirit</I>. They are all temptations
present in every society. We fall prey to them today because of the lack
of self-esteem, mutual respect, and being of value to each other and our
community inherent in our material, greed, and power-centered culture. <BR>
<BR>
The numbers of non-functional people in our schools and cities is rapidly
increasing - people destroyed by lack of love, not being valued, absence
of opportunity; by resultant abuse, drug and alcohol addiction. They in
turn create non-functional families, compounding the damage. We may face
a social meltdown in our society sooner than exhaustion of resources or
impact of environmental degradation. To our great danger, we leave the human,
psychological, emotional, spiritual and communal dimensions of life out
of our goals, our institutions, and our lives.<BR>
<BR>
The escalating violence in our society arises similarly from our core values.
Violence in all forms is inevitable in a culture whose basic value is violence
and whose goal is inequity. Vietnam and the Gulf War have opened our eyes
to the emotional and psychological costs of the overt violence underpinning
our society. Now we must examine the covert violence underpinning everyday
life. <BR>
<BR>
Our use of pesticides, insecticides and antibiotics to &quot;destroy&quot;
competing forms of life is violent agriculture and medicine. Our destruction
of ecosystems and habitat to capture more and more of the earth's food for
ourselves creates a violence of ecological instability. The taking of power
and wealth from the many for the benefit of the few creates the violence
of desperation. Nothing short of discovering the essential benefit of different
values will reverse this self-inflicted inner destruction of our society.
<BR>
<BR>
Slavery enslaves the slave holders as well as the slaves, making them dependent
upon someone else's work and capabilities rather than developing their own
and the self-confidence that results. Wealth does not inevitably, or even
frequently, lead to health, happiness, and meaning in our lives. A society
that lives as consumers rather than creators, and works at jobs where skill
and its application is eliminated wherever possible, develops no sense of
self-worth or joy in either work or leisure. <BR>
<BR>
A world where everyone wears masks, hides their feelings, and closes off
connection with what lies outside their skin leads quickly to collective
insanity. We grow up thinking we're weird because we're not happy - when
all we're seeing are the masks that hide the feelings of inadequacy, unhappiness,
anger and confusion of others. We close ourselves off from the flow of energy
that generates, pervades and nurtures all life, with resulting illness and
atrophy of our own lives.<BR>
<BR>
Inequity of power and wealth lead to anger, rage, and violence - particularly
when the society itself is based on principles of violence. Our technological
society is inherently fragile and vulnerable to the inevitable violence
and terrorism resulting from its inequity. The New York Trade Center and
Oklahoma City bombings are only a foretaste of things to come if the basic
issues of inequality, opportunity, and meaningful lives are not addressed.<BR>
<P><CENTER>***</CENTER>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I woke up one morning this spring with tears streaming down
my face. I had realized, in the night, why I can't sing. <BR>
<BR>
For the last 41 years, I have been unable to sing. ....Yes, I've &quot;sung
along&quot; with others when asked, but it has always been a charade. I
never know whether to sing high, or low, or in the middle. Nothing feels
right, everything feels forced, no note ever feels right or solid, or comes
truly out of me. I slip-slide from one note to another to another in the
middle of a song with no reason and no purpose. It always feels like I'm
wearing someone else's clothes, and they don't fit. There is no power in
the song or in me, the singer.<BR>
<BR>
What swam up out of the locked cells of my memory during the night was what
had happened as a teenager when I had stopped singing. I had stopped simply
because my emotions had become too strong. I valued things deeply that no
one else seemed to value, and I couldn't hide it. I couldn't sing, because
singing comes from and exposes the heart and I had needed to hide my heart
away. Neither it nor I fit the spiritually and emotionally barren world
of the 1950's in which I was growing up. Real emotions and songs from the
heart were not part of that world, and as unacceptable in singing as in
real life. The songs being sung were not from the soul, and the heart had
no room in them. So I became silent.<BR>
<BR>
But song is the voice of the soul, and my soul wants its voice. It wants
to speak, and I want the wholeness from which its silence keeps me. Song
is a mingling of our hearts, a sharing, giving - an affirmation. It is giving
release and place to our emotions. It is as essential to community life
as to our personal ones. We too often leave meetings, discussions, and arguments
with the power of our differences paramount in our emotions and our hearts.
Ending with song reestablishes our commonness and our wholeness which can
encompass and give meaning and perspective to difference.<BR>
<BR>
Without song as an integral part of our lives, there is no shared celebration
of harmony, no balance to the small separating things of life that in sum
can tear us and our society asunder. Song is part of work - of celebrating,
joy and pleasure. It is part of healing - the raising of our spirits, the
expression and purging of grief, the vibrations healing our inner spirits.
We are one when we sing.<BR>
<BR>
Those things on the periphery of life in a society of greed become the center
of life in a society of giving.</BLOCKQUOTE>

FOR OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN</H4>
In another way, the problem of our basic values is even more urgent. In
less than a century, we have built a culture almost entirely dependent upon
massive consumption of petroleum. In doing so, we have already consumed
more than 80% of all the petroleum in the lower 48 states, 76% of all US
reserves, and now more than 60% of all the petroleum in the entire world.
US reserves will be <I>totally</I> exhausted within 25 years and world-wide
resources within 40 years with our present patterns. Adding in current projected
growth in population and consumption, worldwide exhaustion of oil will take
only 20-24 years. <BR>
<BR>
We have let our population and consumption explode without limit, and are
rapidly exceeding the point where they can be sustained with or without
the help of our petroleum dependency.<BR>
<BR>
Global interdependency, population density, and the lack of renewable-energy
based infrastructure would make a massive cultural crash virtually inevitable
as our petroleum resources dwindle. The planet will surely survive our actions.
From a cosmic viewpoint the survival and success of humanity may not be
important. But we have a choice to <I>more</I> than survive. If we change
our act, we can prosper (not grow like cancer) along with the rest of creation
(not at its cost) and be an integral part of the wonderful evolutionary
dance of creation.<I><BR>
<BR>
How can we learn to listen to what we don't want to hear - that we're committing
suicide?</I> How can we gain the confidence to change our ways, head off
into new waters <I>now</I> - before these results are inevitable - and undertake
the major transformation necessary for us to succeed?<BR>
<BR>
This is not an issue for the next generation. It is an issue for today.
The real crunch on petroleum use will not be forty years from now, but will
probably begin in the next five years as costs of extracting petroleum increase,
demand exceeds supply rates, and we realize that the value of remaining
petroleum is far, far greater as lubricants and industrial feed stocks than
as fuels and fertilizers. <BR>
<BR>
Investments are being made <I>now</I> - with no &quot;lifeboats&quot; or
contingency plans - in the transportation, land use, building, agricultural,
and industrial infrastructure to be used over the next fifty years. Building
the wrong structure will be more than a financial disaster. We're also allowing
today the population overload to develop which will compound our problems
in years to come. <BR>
<P><CENTER>***</CENTER>
<BLOCKQUOTE>What are our real resources? We ignore today what is given freely
of life, and focus only on that which must be taken with great effort and
greater loss. The warmth of the sun and the living bounty of the earth has
powered for millennia the giving of food, shelter and warmth for comfortable
and meaningful lives. It, like all else, is not without limit. But it is
given, and continues to be given.<BR>
<BR>
We look also only our outer and not our inner resources - even to having
a sense of what they are. Will, courage, giving, endurance, anger, fear,
love, curiosity, passion, intuition, resolution, resistance, wisdom, cunning,
compulsion, restraint, joy, wit, hopefulness, rashness, caution, wonder,
pride, humility, gratitude, forgiveness. What wonders they do and can create!

<P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="30%"></CENTER>
<P><B>TAPPING NEW DREAMS</B><BR>
<BR>
It is time to acknowledge that the goals we have pursued in a period of
apparent limitless resources are counterproductive as we reach and pass
the limits of those resources. This involves a search for right measure
and right place for our numbers, material needs, and sources of reward and
happiness. Not surprisingly, these rewards and benefits lie in far different
dimensions than those valued and focused on by a world mind-locked into
a frenzied pursuit of quantity.<BR>
<BR>
Fortunately, there is an immense reservoir of resources within the inefficiency
of our present institutions which could enable a comfortable transition
to a sustainable society, <I>if accomplished today</I>. If used instead
solely to support more consumption and more people, it will only postpone
our problems a few years, leave us with far more people to deal with, and
no resources to make a transition.<BR>
<BR>
As vital for our well-being as it is to change our basic values and the
fundamental thrust of our society within the next five years, we need to
recognize that to do so would be a virtually unprecedented act of foresight.
Our species has almost universally waited, until forced, to make any major
shifts in its direction. Yet to even see that possibility means we have
to capability to achieve it. And what we can see from here suggests that
the <I>increase</I> in our well-being inherent in the unexpected new dimensions
of that change will make it an easy and exciting one once we get the courage
to look into the chaos of uncertainty and really examine what we're doing
and its alternatives.<BR>
<P><CENTER>***</CENTER>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A few years ago, I learned viscerally how different the rewards
are that grow from different values. Traditional western music has a 'right'
sequence of notes and a right way of playing. A note or timing not prescribed
in the music sounds, and is, in its context, 'wrong'. Unless we do everything
right, we 'fail' to perform the piece correctly.<BR>
<BR>
Drumming is different. Once inside it, entrained by the beat, we can do
nothing inappropriate. It leads us without conscious effort to be part of
the shared rhythm, and blesses us with the inability to do wrong. There
is no such thing as a wrong note. With drumming, and with improvisational
music in general, any variations we make within it only enrich the music
and make it respond to the immediacy of time and place within which it is
occurring. The music breaks only when we fail to incorporate whatever happens
into it. <BR>
<BR>
One 'wrong note' is an error. It stands out that we didn't mean it. But
if we repeat it again - however odd it may have been - embrace it and draw
it in, acknowledge it and incorporate it, it becomes part of the path of
the music. It merely alters the direction and flavor the music takes, sets
the participants a new challenge, and sets the music off in a new direction.
A good way to approach life, too, perhaps!<BR>
<BR>
Drumming, like all participatory music, makes clear that paying to hear
the best performer in the world cannot match the joy of being part of the
making of the music, or the dance, or the song. Taking part gives pleasure
- to us and to others at the same time. It gives us full-body experience,
learning, and catharsis. It leaves us self-esteem rather than a feeling
of inferiority and of never being able to equal the professional. It gives
us the value of enjoyment, beauty, and pleasure inherent in the rhythms
of life, without money, skill, or fancy equipment. What a wonderful thing,
and model for life - a form of music designed for success, not failure!</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>JOURNEY TO A SACRED LAND</B><BR>
<BR>
All this has led me to the either obvious or surprising conclusion that
we can't succeed until we abandon the <I>secular</I> basis of our world
and allow the <I>sacred</I> nature of relationships in life to reassert
themselves. <BR>
<BR>
Our society has been based on a legalistic structure - of limited commitments
easy to break. We've seen that those embracing greed have the incentives
and rewards to win in that kind of system. As a result, regulations are
unavoidable to even partly control the damage. They will multiply endlessly
as long as we exercise our endless ingenuity in finding new ways to take
from others, to harm and destroy the rest of creation. The only true alternative
is to find a basis for our lives and actions which makes harmful action
inconceivable and rare, rather than the rule. Simple regulations then are
needed only to embody and convey consensus on right action. <BR>
<BR>
But why a <I>sacred</I> basis of society? <BR>
<BR>
Nothing less than our holding sacred the health of our surroundings and
the well-being of others will ensure that we act strongly enough or soon
enough to ensure that health and well-being. <BR>
<BR>
It doesn't take long being with someone we love, to realize that there is
no way we can be happy if the person we love is dissatisfied or unhappy.
Their happiness is our delight, and their lack of happiness quickly shadows
our own. It's not only amazing to find that there are as many ways to make
two happy as one, but even more amazing that we rarely even consider looking
for ways to make more than just ourselves happy. <BR>
<BR>
Anything or anyone we spend time with and come to understand, we come to
love - warts, wrinkles and all. When we love something, we cannot be happy
ourselves unless the health and well-being of what we love is ensured. Loving
thus results in making the well-being of what is loved inviolate. That is
the essence of holding something sacred, and the glue of life - not laws
and government regulations. All follows from that.<BR>
<BR>
Honor ourselves. Honor others. Honor all life.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The mountain we live on is a sacred one. Its name, Neahkahnie,
means 'place of the gods&quot;, and it has been honored and held sacred
from the depths of time. Even today, it holds a place of deep reverence
in the lives of us who have given birth on it, who have lived upon it, who
have scattered the ashes of our loved ones from its peak and its cliffs,
and whose lives are daily intertwined with it. When a whale breeches clear
out of the water as we scatter the ashes of a friend off a cliff into the
sea, or a hawk blesses us with the brush of its wing feathers on our head
as we set the last rafter of our building; when we watch the shadow of the
sun racing towards us across the water bringing the totality of a solar
eclipse; when we have lived through the years with the mountain in wind
and rain, storm and sun - our lives cannot be parted.<BR>
<BR>
The life of our mountain, and the lives of those whose world it shares,
are being closed in upon. Housing inches higher and higher up its sides
- not housing for need, but for the greed of vacation homes for the wealthy
in a world where a billion people are starving yet where we refuse to limit
our numbers. A highway gnaws deeper and deeper into the mountain's very
flanks where it rises out of the sea, and its traffic brings the ceaseless
grasping energy of urban culture to destroy the mountain's serenity. The
top of the mountain has been entrusted to the government to preserve as
a state park for its intrinsic value and for the needs of future generations.
That has not proved enough.<BR>
<BR>
The government plans now to allow the protected mountain top to be used
for a commercial cellular telephone communications installation, even though
better sites were available. As we opposed that action, the wrongness of
it seemed somehow out of proportion to the size of the installation itself,
and we could understand why even many of our neighbors were puzzled about
our opposition. With the depth of our unconscious cultural conditioning,
it was hard to find either the words or the strength to raise the issues
of its deeper wrongness. Yet it was there.<BR>
<BR>
The issue, as it became clear, was far deeper than that of using a state
park for commercial profit. It had to do with our failing to hold anything
sacred. If there is any place in our area which is and should be held sacred,
it is this mountain. If we fail to hold even it inviolate, it means we hold
nothing sacred; that we love nothing; that we know not how to love. If that
prevails, I fear for our souls, and hold no hope for our society. It is
totally in character for us to take, to destroy, the mountain and turn it
into a 'for-profit' use. There must be something offensive and threatening
in a mountain standing free with its head in the stars, garlanded by the
upturned branches of live trees among the stump-topped, logged-over mountains
and fishless streams that surround it and stand witness to our overreaching
greed and destructiveness.<BR>
<BR>
Because I fear for our souls, I will fight for the mountain and with it
for the sacredness within the lives of each of us, and for the survival
and health of our society. Taking without need and without limit breeds
a callousness in our hearts and closes us off from others and from the life
around us. Walling off our hearts cuts us off from the nurture as well as
from the pain from outside. Walled off, we wither and die. Empty, we strike
out for something, anything, that will allay that emptiness. Yet nothing
we grab and take from others can reach that walled-off emptiness, and its
failure leaves us only more and more desperate. The only thing that can
alleviate its pain is love, and opening ourselves to the vulnerability and
pain of allowing love even in the face of our unloving behavior.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="30%"></CENTER>
<P><I>Talking</I> about life in a sacred society can reveal some vital differences
from a secular one. But it has always been clear that <I>living</I> in a
sacred way or in a sacred society is a totally different thing, with profoundly
different experience and value that can't be described in the experience
framework of a secular society. How do we individually make the jump from
one to the other, and how do we create the &quot;other&quot; to jump to?
What is that world like, and how is it different from our present one? The
changes are of texture and meaning, of the changes of nurture and experience
and the personal qualities of our lives. <BR>
<P><CENTER>***</CENTER>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Last winter I was standing on the edge of that unseen chasm
to an invisible world that might or might not exist or be reachable. I was
clear that I no longer was in any real way part of our secular world - I
existed as some sort of cyst within its body, but no longer had much in
common with its goals, dreams, rewards, or day-to day life. And I didn't
know what to do. I got more desperate and more depressed at my inability
to find my way out of my impasse.<BR>
<BR>
Then I went to a retreat held by the alternative elementary school we had
helped found 12 years ago. Our family had been quite active in it - my wife
a founder, director, and teacher; our kids spending their elementary years
there; myself designing and helping build the building and active in the
endless fund-raising and operational work. My wife was retiring, or taking
a sabbatical, and the focus of the retreat was to acknowledge and affirm
the past and see what similar or different touchstone existed for the new
families to take leadership in its continuance.<BR>
<BR>
We were asked individually to look back, see what had been left unsaid and
unresolved about the past - affirm it, express any regrets or resentments
we held about it, acknowledge and celebrate it all, and free ourselves for
the new individual and collective futures that were now opening.<BR>
<BR>
As we went around the room, people kept opening more and more wonderful
feelings from the depths of their hearts...and some dirty laundry, of course.
What was most amazing was that the room became a wonderful circle of love
that made it safe and possible to open our hearts and acknowledge whatever
was in there. And seeing one person after another acknowledge and deal with
regrets and resentments they held let us all see that holding those things
didn't change the past - they only burrowed into us and hurt us and poisoned
our own future! A lot of weights were shed, along with a lot of tears, and
the depth of trust and support everyone gave everyone else was truly amazing.
<BLOCKQUOTE>Experiencing this, something let loose inside me - partly there,
partly in a series of other experiences over the next couple of months,
and I suddenly became aware that I was living in that &quot;other&quot;
world. I hadn't jumped a chasm, I didn't make any leap of faith or go through
some grand transformation. But the world I had been standing in somehow
crumbled away beneath me. With the support of those around me, I let it
go, and found I was standing on something far more solid and nurturing which
lay beneath it all along. There was no jump to make - only letting go of
the crumbling walls of beliefs we build up around us.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
Somehow, the kernel of that new world has stayed with me. The other world
still exists, but my belief in it is gone and no longer gives it power.
I still work, go to the grocery, meet people, deal with the everyday world.
But HOW I deal with it and relate to people comes from a different and deeper
place. Almost every encounter or experience now has new dimensions to it,
unexpected meaning or value, and is slowly solidifying the foundation for
a new life and new world to inhabit. I'm certainly still me, but more and
differently so. And the world I now inhabit - though with warts and wrinkles
like any world - is truly a sacred one. Our love and caring for each other
is the secret bridge that lets us cross that vulnerable space into a new
kind of openness and relation to our world.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>SIX PILLARS OF SUCCESS</B><BR>
<BR>
A year or so ago I tried to summarize the principles needed for a sustainable
society. There were only a few: 
<UL>
  <LI>EQUITY 
  <LI>SECURITY 
  <LI>SUSTAINABILITY 
  <LI>RESPONSIBILITY 
  <LI>GIVING 
  <LI>SACREDNESS 
</UL>
<BR>
Together, they ensure the well-being of all life, and the marshaling of
our actions and dreams effectively to achieve the best for all. They encompass
the restoration of health to our lives:
<DL>
  <DT>EQUITY: 
  <DD><I>* To ensure that all people have equitable access to and share
of wealth, health, income, security, education, opportunity, respect, political
power, and fulfilling work.* To ensure that all life has the scope to ensure
well-being and development of innate capabilities.</I> 
  <DT><BR>
SECURITY: 
  <DD><I>* To remove the imbalances of power, self-esteem, opportunity,
resource access, and emotional health which form the base of fear and insecurity.*
To realize that biosystem health, a lasting supply of world resources, and
the capabilities of human and global systems - not material consumption
rates - constitute our real wealth. To act to ensure and improve the health
and capabilities of these resources. </I>
  <DT><BR>
SUSTAINABILITY: 
  <DD><I>* To stabilize and restore population to long term supportable
levels commensurate with the well-being of all life. * To draw materials
and energy only from renewable sources and at sustainable rates. * To work
within those energy and material use levels to both improve our non-material
quality of life and more effectively provide for our material needs.</I>
  <DT><BR>
RESPONSIBILITY: 
  <DD><I>* To enact full ecological analysis to ensure public knowledge
of the true costs of our actions. * To live within our sustainable incomes,
not take from future generations and other life, and to ensure them undiminished
opportunity for fulfillment.* To ensure that all industrial producers assume
eternal responsibility for the products and byproducts they create.* To
protect and preserve farm, forest, aquatic, and other natural resources.*
To protect natural, cultural and spiritual resources until all jurisdictions
restore and enhance their own to levels which meet the needs of their populations.</I>
  <DT><BR>
GIVING: 
  <DD><I>* To acknowledge the primacy of non-material rewards in personal
and community health and develop giving-based principles of interaction
which honor the contribution of all life to what we hold of value.* To replace
our violent forms of obtaining food and resources with ones which are based
on consensus and fulfilling the needs of all parties.* To ensure all have
roles in the community which offer meaningful self-esteem, mutual respect,
and being of value to the community of all life.</I> 
  <DT><BR>
SACREDNESS: 
  <DD><I>* To acknowledge that our greatest cultural problems are at root
diseases of the spirit. To act to improve the spiritual, mental, psychological
and communal dimensions of our real wealth and their expression in our communities.*
To seek the wisdom and connectedness to restore well-being to all of creation
and purpose and meaning to our lives.</I>

<BLOCKQUOTE>One day I was going through the familiar process of an architect
with a client, working out the program for a project. I was taking notes
as the client described what they wanted in the project. Suddenly I found
I wasn't paying any attention at all to the specifics - all I was hearing
was the insistent repetition of 'I want...', 'I want...', 'I want...', 'I
want...'. Without thinking, and surprising us both, I blurted out, &quot;Let's
go though this again, and start with &quot;I want to GIVE....&quot;, &quot;I
want to GIVE....&quot;, &quot;I want to GIVE....&quot;. Let's see if we
come up with something different.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
We did. Once we got past the shock, we began to discover possibilities that
totally changed the value of the project. We found we could locate meeting
rooms to make them available for community use in the evenings. We found
we could cool the surrounding area as well as the building site, and restore
a bit of nature to the city, by planting street trees around the project.
We found that changing the height of a retaining wall could give a comfortable
place for people to sit. We found that replacing another wall with a few
steps and a path made a wonderful pedestrian short-cut from the community
on one side of the project to the other. We found that by altering a small
garden area, we could make room for birds and other life to share the place.
We found that through the slight extra cost of more durable materials we
could give a free building to the next generation.<BR>
<BR>
It &quot;IS a gift to be giving.&quot; Giving is an integral part of loving,
and loving is the root of holding things sacred. It is a unique form of
ACTION. It enriches the giver and the receiver both, and creates multiple
value out of each and every exchange. If 'What can I give in this situation?'
is in our hearts every time we talk with or do something with someone, we
not only leave a legacy of gifts in addition to our intended interaction,
but we generate an enduring climate of trust, mutual caring, thankfulness
and happiness which moves outward like the waves in the sea.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="30%"></CENTER>
<H4><BR>
ACKNOWLEDGING FEARS AND HOPES</H4>
Objective &quot;facts&quot; have little bearing on our willingness to be
open to examining alternatives to the values upon which we base our lives.
More crucial are the deep fears and hopes in our hearts that need to be
acknowledged and addressed before we can let loose of old dreams for new.
<BR>
<BR>
If our dreams continue to be boundless, some of us hope that &quot;more&quot;
will make us happier. They hope it will give us better health care, better
housing, and better jobs. At the same time, others of us fear that continued
growth in our numbers and appetites will result in destruction of the resource
base that sustains us. They fear overpopulation that can't be sustained,
and the resultant uncertainties of abrupt, forced, and uncontrolled change.
They fear violent action of increasing number of &quot;have-nots&quot; and
other results of not dealing with political, social and economic equity.<BR>
<BR>
If, on the other hand we acknowledge that exponential growth can't continue,
and find right measure and right place for our dreams, some of us hope this
will permit us to develop healthier work and relationships. They hope to
gain the security of stable and sustainable support systems. And they hope
to gain the security of equity and justness; to learn and live non-violent
values, and to reconnect with the rest of nature and life. <BR>
<BR>
Others of us fear that such a change might result in loss of jobs and economic
disruption. They fear not being able to fulfill dreams of possessions, education
or success; not having enough wealth or power to ensure our survival and
well-being, or not being wise or skilled enough to succeed in a more equitable
world. They are concerned about possible retaliation from rest of the world
for our past abuse of power and resources; or possible revolt of those seeking
equity. They fear that &quot;new rules&quot; can't give a good life, and
fear the basic uncertainties of change.<BR>
<BR>
Getting our hopes and fears such as these concerning the base values of
our society out into the open makes it possible to generate real dialog,
empathy, and discussion. Many hopes or fears dissolve in the light of day.
Others can be dealt with in the real nuts and bolts process of crafting
such a change in a win-win way. Without their being in the open, we certainly
will be grabbing onto those inner dreams and fears so tightly that we will
be unable to even hear what others are saying.<BR>
<P><CENTER>***</CENTER>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Last March, I was speaking at an international environmental
law conference. Wanting an update, I sat in on one of the sessions on 'population'.
I felt I had walked into an alien world. Piles of literature were thrust
into our hands as we entered the meeting room. Every seat was covered with
competing tracts and fact sheets. Speakers were stridently objecting that
opposing speakers were given a minute more time than them. Speakers intent
on stuffing our ears with information talked so fast as to be unintelligible.
People were speaking in some kind of code that made it extremely difficult
to find their real concerns. The human energy in the room was so twisted
that it was all I could do to keep from bolting for the door - but I was
fascinated at what was going on.<BR>
<BR>
The differences were obviously long-standing and basic among the speakers
- old enough that handouts could be used to convey each one's message. I
had their 'facts' in hand. What else did I most want from each speaker?
What I really wanted was to know what lay beneath those 'facts' - what were
the unexpressed fears and hopes and longings that must be festering inarticulate
beneath such powerfully held differences. I wanted to know what THEIR truth
was - what was most vital to them - in that very moment and place, and what
they hoped we could give them.<BR>
<BR>
As it finally unraveled, the issues were not of population or numbers or
even measures to manage those numbers. In one group of speakers, it slowly
revealed itself to be a strong and justified fear that immigration and population
issues were being used to resurrect old patterns of racial harassment and
intimidation. The other group of speakers' fears didn't reveal themselves
until someone asked why we shouldn't open all national borders and allow
free movement of PEOPLE as well as money and resources. <BR>
<BR>
Then a whole cluster of fears spilled out, centered around the issue of
equity. There was fear of not being able to compete and survive without
the imbalance of resources and power we've had; fear of retribution against
those who have had more than their equitable share of wealth, power and
resources; and fear of losing the apparent security enjoyed by our inequitable
concentration of wealth.<BR>
<BR>
This is the true value of meetings. A meeting is not necessary for reading
papers or for communicating information about what is known. Why, in the
world of fax, xerox, and electronic publishing, did we even try to use meetings
to convey information? What came across most dominantly from the interchanges
was the worship of clock-time chopping everything into incoherence rather
than asking how the time together could best resolve issues.<BR>
<BR>
The coming together of people gives us a place to share and discuss what
is new, uncertain and unknown - a place where our eyes and hearts can touch,
where we can explore together. It makes a place where, given a safe and
supportive atmosphere, we can share, learn from each other, and with empathy,
forge the hard alloy of consensus out of differences.<BR>
<BR>
When we come together, and when we speak from the heart, we speak the truth
- our truth. It may not be a universal truth, but it is a real truth grown
out of the unique life and experience of each of us. I can take your truth
and add it to mine, and find a greater truth. You can take mine and add
it to yours, and also find a greater truth. Together, we can make of them
an even greater and shared truth. We can touch real issues, fight real demons,
and make real progress. With that, we lose all patience with the invisible
walls created by our conventional patterns and rituals of conferences and
meetings which prevent real progress.<BR>
<BR>
Listen - to our hearts. </BLOCKQUOTE>

SHEDDING A SKIN THAT NO LONGER FITS</H4>
To let go of beliefs and a world that no longer serve us, we need to know
another reality exists, that it is good, and that it is achievable. We need
to deal with our own hopes and fears and those of others. We need courage,
and to know that time and time again in the past we have been able to overcome
daunting obstacles and achieve unprecedented goals. We need to keep clear
in our hearts and minds:<I><BR>
<BR>
* There ARE deep and inherent problems with the core beliefs of our society.
</I>
<DL>
  <DD>We need to have the strength to acknowledge this - even if we don't
have total solutions at hand. We won't find answers without admitting to
the problems, and are far more likely to find solutions once we can shift
focus to resolving them. Many more pieces of the solution than we might
expect are already at hand - once we begin to look. 
</DL>
<I><BR>
* A fundamental difference exists between a death- and a life-centered society.</I>
<DL>
  <DD>We cannot have both. What does it do to our hearts to be willing to
take everything from everyone and everyplace else for ourselves? To attempt
to implement specific measures such as recycling without dealing with basic
cultural values only results in their being twisted into enabling bad underlying
patterns to continue a bit longer. 
</DL>
<I><BR>
* The source of our true wealth is not depletion of our resources, increase
in our numbers, or taking from others.</I> 
<DL>
  <DD>A truly wealthy individual is one who has the love and respect of
others and the ability to give; equitable opportunity for the physical,
emotional and spiritual health which the natural world can sustain; and
opportunity to develop and employ their abilities and to be of real value
to the community.

and personally experience the deep personal and social rewards of those
changes and the vast improvement in effectiveness inherent in them.

<BLOCKQUOTE>I was sitting one night, grieving on the direction our world
seems to be moving, and trying to figure out what, if anything, I could
do to change it. I began to dwell on the difference between word and action,
and wondered what I would be willing to do if it would help move the world
to a better place. Would I, I wondered, be willing to face abuse? Would
I really be willing, if necessary, to go to jail? Would I, even, be willing
to die? <BR>
<BR>
At another time, perhaps, my answer would be different, but I've lived a
good many years of a pretty good life. My children will soon be off on their
own. A few more years of my life really isn't absolutely essential for anything
I can see. <BR>
<BR>
And suddenly it burst out of me, &quot;Yes! Without question! If giving
something now which I would be giving up sometime anyhow could make possible
restoring a center of sacredness to our culture and reconnection with the
rest of life? If that could mean an enduring, evolving and enriching web
of life on this planet, then my life would be a paltry gift to give to attain
such a wonderful end!&quot;<BR>
<BR>
And with that, my boundaries seemed to burst open. I felt constraints give
way within me and new vistas of possibility open before me. The old rules
which governed my actions no longer held power or limited me. I began to
feel like a 'deux ex machina' - something new interjected into a game following
a totally new and unknown set of rules. I felt blocked energies begin to
flow, and new energies beginning to gather. I understood now the stories
of old where warriors would give themselves over to the gods before a battle,
and the power that would be released to flow through them.<BR>
<BR>
I've no intention of looking for a bridge to jump off, and there remain
the million hair-splitting decisions on the lesser opportunities of real
life as to what I can give and what can be gained. But I live in a new freedom,
and a new joy in the wonder of everyday life.</BLOCKQUOTE>

CHANGE IS THE ONLY INEVITABLE</H4>
A piece of us keeps wondering, &quot;Is it even possible to stop growth
in population and consumption? <BR>
<BR>
The reality is we've never really tried. <BR>
<BR>
The first thing needed is a commitment to do it. Period. The second is to
figure out the least intrusive ways of reaching that goal, and only using
the means necessary to get there. The only inevitable thing about inevitable
growth is that those who would profit from it will try to convince us that
growth is inevitable!<BR>
<BR>
Where do we start? Public personal and community commitment. Education.
Avoiding <I>unwanted</I> births. Empowerment of women. Social justice. Economic
security and equity. Many believe that these actions alone will achieve
a stabilization of population. If more is needed? End subsidies to growth.
Stop providing food and medical support of overpopulation. Allow compassionate
death. Beyond this, China has shown there are a whole range of further actions
which can be successfully used - <I>if necessary.</I><BR>
<BR>
Even though population and consumption are &quot;commons&quot; issues, any
local jurisdiction can begin the process by stopping subsidy to new development
and non-replacement new construction, eliminating tax breaks for relocating
industry, freezing urban growth boundaries, capping building permits, requiring
evidence of residency for local jobs, eliminating subsidies to large families,
taxing wealth rather than homes, and nurturing and encouraging non-material
rewards for residents.<BR>
<BR>
There is no way to know with exactness what measures will actually be needed.
The essential action is the commitment to achieve stabilization.<BR>
<P><CENTER>***</CENTER>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It was curious how we felt when our house burned down the night
we finished building it. The most difficult thing was to convince ourselves
of the reality of it - that such a real, concrete thing which we had sweated
on in the rain fox six months had vanished overnight - was GONE. We grieved
the loss of special things. For months we would look for something only
to remember - &quot;Oh, yeah, gone in the fire.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps most surprising was the sense of actual relief and freedom we felt
at not having 'things'. Our real needs are few and simple, it turns out.
It is amazing how the gift of a pair of shoes or socks seemed to almost
take care of it all, and how cherished are the special things given from
someone's heart. And there is a real burden to 'possessions' which we clearly
felt on having that load inadvertently removed.<BR>
<BR>
What we missed most was not the 'things'. It was missing the opportunity
to relish the reward of our six months of hard work. It was a sense of not
being able to move on with our lives, but instead having to back up and
do it all again. And there was a sense of loss and of negligence in having
allowed the wood, metal, glass, and other materials to have gone to waste,
the trees to have been cut down. Scariest was the ripping asunder of our
sense of the predictability of the universe. All sorts of unbelievable things
could happen. We dreamed wild things.<BR>
<BR>
Our neighbor empathized with our loss. Her husband had died unexpectedly
a month earlier. In the balance, our loss WAS trivial. It was only 'things'.<BR>
<BR>
And then there was the incredible mystery of the diary. To this day we carry
an undeniable knowledge that there are hidden aspects to our universe which
we deny in everyday life, because of it. A friend from all the way across
the country told us about the diary a month after the fire. In it she had
written, several months before the fire, her dream that our house would
burn down; and wrote down the day on which it would, and did, happen.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="30%"></CENTER>
<H4><BR>
UNEXPECTED GIFTS</H4>
We find unexpected bonuses when we try on the unthinkable - a world which
seeks betterment rather than biggerment, a world where growth in quality
replaces growth in numbers and material goods. <BR>
<BR>
An amazing amount of our work and resources now goes to the duplication
of our entire infrastructure of homes, roads, water and sewer systems, cities,
agriculture, etc. every generation as our population doubles. Instead of
just maintaining what we have which meets the needs of our present population,
we have had to build from scratch entirely new facilities to house and feed
twice as many people. Without that population growth, we avoid the need
for all that work and resource use! <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Non-growth&quot; means in itself dramatically lessened impact on resources,
farm land, and each other. It means less work and more leisure for everyone.
It means resources can be available to deal with real needs. <BR>
<BR>
It means time for sports, music, community, art, games and leisure - both
inside and out of work. Without the belief that we have to be continuous
and excessive consumers to keep our economy afloat, it means we can find
personal freedom from debt, from stress of work and consumption, and the
burden of unneeded &quot;things&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
Without &quot;growth&quot; as an excuse (&quot;there will be more for everyone&quot;),
to keep from dealing with issues of equity, we will face and be able to
deal with those issues which underlie so many of our social problems. With
that, the fears which have increasingly filled our lives can be resolved.<BR>
<BR>
Living values that we can be proud of allows us to speak from the heart.
It lets us live life with an open heart; reconnect and share energy with
others; and permits the life and wisdom of others to add measure to our
own. Our everyday actions begin to reveal new senses of the universe we
inhabit.<BR>
<P><CENTER>***</CENTER>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Nothing could have prepared me for speaking to an audience of
1000 people in Japan. I was comfortable with talking from my old college
professoring days, and knew that an audience can draw more out of you than
you knew was there. I had spent time in Japan before, and knew the intensity
of Zen monks. These, however, were ordinary people, not Zen monks.<BR>
<BR>
During a talk in the States, people come and go, drink coffee, fidget, blow
their noses, look around the room. I'm as bad as anyone. But here there
was absolute silence and stillness the whole time. The total attention of
every eye in the room was sustained even through the hiatus of translation
- not just for me, but for every speaker. It was the same respect they showed
everything. And it was like sticking my finger into a 220 volt outlet.<BR>
<BR>
Who says that an energy dimension to our lives and relationships doesn't
exist? Even with interruption every sentence or two for translation, that
energy made me feel more comfortable and feel more responsibility to do
my best than I'd ever felt giving a talk. It made me risk raising questions
I never before had the courage to consider, and then even gave me answers.
With that energy, I spoke more from the heart, and communicated far more
than I ever had to an American audience speaking the same language. We were
all immensely richer for it.<BR>
<BR>
Thousands of people have personally experienced the 'chi' of yoga, tai chi,
or acupuncture. We talk of people 'sapping our energy' or speak of someone
'having good energy'. We are consistently happy or uncomfortable with the
energy of certain places. Yet a shift to truly acknowledging that energy
dimension of life means realizing we are intrinsically and inseparably one
with the rest of creation. And we can no longer support our old values and
actions once we do that.<BR>
<BR>
We are bathed in and permeated by energy from the sun - far, far greater
amounts and broader spectra of energy than the visible light that fuels
photosynthesis and supports the metabolism of life. The earth's magnetic
fields and rotating iron core induce much of that energy into the earth
itself and its atmosphere. <BR>
<BR>
You might expect the multitude of life forms that have emerged on this planet
to have seized upon this, like any energy source, to fuel and inform their
life. And so they have. <BR>
<BR>
Matter is congealed energy, and our bodies and the physical world around
us the congealed patterns of matter that have formed around a matrix of
energy. In a sense, our energy bodies are more primary than our physical
ones, and the processes and relationships there more basic than in our physical
bodies. And they are profoundly interconnected.<BR>
<BR>
Our sciences in the 20th century have been no less prone to denying dimensions
of existence they didn't have the tools to apprehend than any previous period
- only more arrogant about their blindness. This, in spite of almost a hundred
different cultures having described phenomena such as energy healing or
auric fields, many with detailed healing practices for both people and place!
Some sciences continue this denial even now, in spite of the accepted success
of acupuncture, kinesiology, and other healing practices based on the energy
dimensions of our lives.<BR>
<BR>
Experience of this aspect of existence profoundly changes our view of our
lives and our world. Nurturing energy flows that course through our bodies
except when we block them off; existence as nodes in a continuous interconnecting
field of energy rather than discrete, separate objects; spiritual healing;
being so coherently interlinked with others that our thoughts and memories
are one; walking in the fields of incipient form where things and events
take shape - strange and unexpected new worlds open before us. <BR>
<BR>
To touch on the edges of these worlds totally changes our perceptions, our
values, and the lives and actions which can sustain health and achieve our
potentials. It restores and opens vast new dimensions to our lives and our
concepts of the possible. Nowhere in all this do the petty and blind flailings
of our past such as greed, material possessions, self-centeredness, and
dominion over nature hold sway or even place.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="30%"></CENTER>
<P><B>WHEN OUR HEARTS DO TOUCH</B><BR>
<BR>
It can and will be done. A time does come when we let loose of old ways
and walk forth in a transformed world. It is easier when our friends are
there. It is easier when at least the outline of the way is visible. It
is easier to no longer have discord between our experience and the myths
that underlie our culture and the actions of others. It is a heavy burden
removed, and a new rightness buoying, connecting and directing our lives.<BR>
<P><CENTER>***</CENTER>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Our friends are there. Our community awaits us. A familiar feeling
wells up reading a passage in a book about South African Archbishop Desmund
TuTu: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;We Africans speak about a concept difficult to render
in English. We speak of UBUNTU or BOTHO. You know when it is there, and
it is obvious when it is absent. It has to do with what it means to be truly
human. It refers to gentleness, to compassion, to hospitality, to openness
to others, to vulnerability, to be available for others and to know that
you are bound up with them in the bundle of life, for a person is only a
person through other persons.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
I see these same characteristics as distinguishing what it is like to live
as part of a sacred world in absolute contrast to the characteristics of
life in a world of greed and self-centeredness. They are also the identical
things I feel in others and myself when we are relating in ways which seem
to empower all concerned.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="30%"></CENTER>
<BLOCKQUOTE>When we look in awe at the achievements in South Africa in recent
years, we know that miracles do exist, that we can achieve the impossible
and create for ourselves a future worth living for! <BR>
<BR>
We belong to the world. We belong to life. It is a glorious thing to behold
and be part of the ongoing creation of life. We are finding that the creation
of which we are part is even more awesome than ever imagined. Casting our
lives into the balance on the side of life - of becoming and being a part
of the on-going evolution of new, more unexpected, and ever more wonderful
combinations of life - is a future to brighten all of our dreams.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>
We're told that time-payment, pay-as-you-go, or credit buying, has benefits
that justify the cost. We are able to have use of what we're buying while
we pay for it instead of having to wait until we've saved the money for
its purchase. Some truth there.....maybe. But lets look down the road a
bit, at the end of that situation, or better yet, a few purchases later.
<BR>
<BR>
After fifteen years, we've bought and financed five cars, let's say, and
given ourselves the same rationale each time. But if we compare a financed
end situation to a cash scenario, where we'd gone without, or driven a junker,
or shared while we saved to buy just the first one, we'd see very significant
differences! <BR>
<BR>
After the first purchase, we're not going without a vehicle in either scenario.
Debt financing ends up with possible use benefit during the first vehicle's
life, but with five vehicles interest payments. Pay-as-you-go ends up with
possible partial inconvenience during the first vehicle's life, but with
interest payments gained on savings for 12 years instead of financing charges
paid out for fifteen years! <I><BR>
<BR>
We only benefit from credit or debt financing the <U>first</U> time we use
it. On subsequent purchases financing is a major expense (often doubling
the total cost of purchases) that we're trapped into with no real benefit,
because payments on the original debt prevent us from saving for subsequent
purchases.</I><BR>
<BR>
We can also see that if we adopt a pay-as-you-go pattern generally, the
savings generated quickly allow us to immediately pay cash for purchases
rather than having to wait until we've saved up the cost. This eliminates
even the original justification and value of debt financing. <BR>
<BR>
These alternatives represent <I>major</I> differences in cumulative costs.
Look at our personal expenditure patterns as a whole, including car and
home payments, credit card purchases, etc. Added up, <I>we're talking a
cost difference amounting to maybe ten years of net income. And this translates
into perhaps fifteen years of our total pretax income!</I> A pretty heavy
price for sloppy thinking. <BR>
<BR>
In the public realm, debt-financing such as bonded capital improvements
results in our paying double what those improvements would otherwise cost.
Debt financing in the public realm is one of perhaps a half-dozen baseline
reasons our public expenditures have become unaffordable. <BR>
<BR>
A city needs a new $10 million sewage treatment plant and votes in a 30
year bond issue to pay for it. No one mentions that the actual total cost
to pay off the bonds is probably $20 million, not $10 million. A few years
later the city needs a new school, then a new hospital, then street improvements,
then a new landfill or water treatment plant. Because of the $10 million
finance charges on the first debt, it can't revenue-finance the subsequent
needs, and has to bond-finance them, and successive ones also.<BR>
<BR>
The reality is that capital investments are a consistent ongoing process
of every city, county, state or national government. The government that
plans ahead sees roughly what improvements will be needed, and when. Then
they get those needs queued up so that each can be financed in turn out
of current revenues. Improvements are obtained at half the cost and with
freedom of action that the debt-financing entity has lost. <BR>
<BR>
Many higher education systems, for example, now have an ongoing budget item
for construction. Campus A gets a new physics building this year, campus
B gets a new gym next year, and Campus C gets some new dormitories two years
later, all financed out of current revenues.<BR>
<BR>
Proponents of public debt-financing point to low interest costs, and talk
about inflation resulting in &quot;lower cost of repayment dollars&quot;.
Interest rates on loans, however, already include a projection for anticipated
inflation in addition to interest rates for the lender. And all expenditures,
as well as income, in later inflationary years have to be paid for in those
worth-less dollars. <BR>
<BR>
The length of most public capital improvement bonds is long enough that
interest represents a higher proportion of repayment costs than on personal
loans, and means that more old loans are having to be pay for each year
instead of paying cash for current expenditures. <BR>
<BR>
Looked at in aggregate, by examining the financial records of typical public
bodies over a forty or fifty year period, we can clearly see: 
<UL>
  <LI>Consistent patterns and levels of continuing capital expenditures,
virtually all debt financed after the first occurrence of debt financing.
  <LI>Repayment demands each year of twenty to thirty years of old debts,
not just current ones. 
  <LI>Total debt service on old debts each year running about as high as
current expenditures (excluding their commitments to future debt costs).
</UL>
<I><BR>
Aggregate patterns of expenditures, and real world records demonstrate clearly
that revenue financing instead of debt financing would consistently achieve
the same series of improvements - but for half the cost.</I><BR>
<BR>
Revenue financing vs. debt or bond issue financing means big bucks. State
and local governments in Oregon alone currently issue somewhat over a billion
dollars of bonds per year. In rough figures, this debt load results in an
equal amount of debt service costs per year. A billion dollars a year for
one small state may not buy a trip to the moon, but it can help us accomplish
many needed goals.
<H2><CENTER>*****</CENTER>
</H2>
There are a number of actions which can help ensure us the freedom to choose
affordable ways of purchasing: 
<UL>
  <LI>Require ballot information on the total cost of bond issues to encourage
us to support revenue-financed alternatives. <BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Enact state statutes which require or encourage revenue financing
for public capital improvements.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Enact legislation to protect state and local jurisdictions from being
forced into debt financing to pay for federally mandated projects. <BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Eliminate tax-deductability of corporate and personal debt service.
<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Develop alternative auto financing institutions based on saving rather
than repeated borrowing. 
</UL>

<BR>
Alternate courses of action with apparently equivalent financial, environmental,
and social results may actually leave us in <I>entirely</I> different end
positions. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Endgame analysis </B>suggests that we give primary consideration to the
different endgame positions we can end up in from alternate actions as well
as to the financial and other returns gained in the course of the actions.
With it, we can discover profoundly different results lurking in unconsidered
alternatives.<B><BR>
<BR>
Endgame thinking really shines when we look at debt financing. Here it clearly
shows us that something which may seem to be of value done once, can become
a disaster when repeated.</B> It shows us as well that debt financing, (a
true economic cocaine), also makes it extremely hard to avoid slipping from
the &quot;once good&quot; into the &quot;continuing disaster&quot; category.
Let's look a bit closer.<BR>
<BR>
We're told that time-payment, pay-as-you-go, or credit buying, has benefits
that justify the cost. We are able to have use of what we're buying while
we pay for it instead of having to wait until we've saved the money for
its purchase. Some truth there.... maybe. But lets look down the road a

After fifteen years, we've bought and financed five cars, let's say, and
given ourselves the same rationale each time. But if we compare a &quot;financed&quot;
end situation to a &quot;cash&quot; scenario, where we'd gone without, or
driven a junker, or shared while we saved to buy <I>just the </I>first<I>

ends up with possible </I>partial<I> inconvenience during the first vehicle's

<BR>
A city needs a new $10 million sewage treatment plant and votes in a 30
year bond issue to pay for it. No one mentions that the actual total cost
to pay off the bonds is probably $20 million, not $10 million. A few years
later the city needs a new school, then a new hospital, then street improvements,
then a new landfill or water treatment plant. Because of the $10 million
finance charges on the first debt, it can't revenue-finance the subsequent
needs, and has to bond-finance them, and successive ones also.<BR>
<BR>
The reality is that capital investments are a consistent ongoing process
of every city, county, state or national government. The government that
plans ahead sees roughly what improvements will be needed, and when. Then
they get those needs queued up so that each can be financed in turn out
of current revenues. Improvements are obtained at half the cost and with
freedom of action that the debt-financing entity has lost. <BR>
<BR>
Many higher education systems, for example, now have an ongoing budget item
for construction. Campus A gets a new physics building this year, campus
B gets a new gym next year, and Campus C gets some new dormitories two years
later, all financed out of current revenues.<BR>
<BR>
Proponents of public debt-financing point to low interest costs, and talk
about inflation resulting in &quot;lower cost of repayment dollars&quot;.
<BR>
<BR>
Interest rates on loans, however, already include a projection for anticipated
inflation in addition to interest rates for the lender .The length of most
public capital improvement bonds is also long enough that interest represents
a higher proportion of repayment costs than on personal loans, and means
that more &quot;old loans&quot; are having to be pay for each year instead
of paying cash for current expenditures. <BR>
<BR>
Looked at in aggregate, by examining the financial records of almost any
public body over a forty or fifty year period, we can clearly see: 
<UL>
  <LI>Consistent patterns and levels of continuing capital expenditures,
virtually all debt-financed after the first occurrence of debt-financing.
  <LI>Repayment demands each year of twenty to thirty years of old debts,
not just current ones. 
  <LI>Total debt service on old debts each year running about as high as
current expenditures (excluding their commitments to future debt costs).
</UL>
<B><BR>
Aggregate patterns of expenditures, and real world records demonstrate clearly
that revenue-financing instead of debt-financing would consistently have
achieved the same series of improvements - but for half the cost.</B><BR>
<BR>
Revenue financing vs. debt or bond issue financing means big bucks. State
and local governments in Oregon alone currently issue somewhat over a billion
dollars of bonds per year. In rough figures, this debt load results in an
equal amount of debt service costs per year. A billion dollars a year for
one small state may not buy a trip to the moon, but I can think of a lot
of things it would do!<BR>
<P><CENTER>* * *</CENTER>
<P>Endgame thinking involves figuring out what kind of a position we want
to be in some years hence, when actions we are committing ourselves to today
have made their effect. It helps us choose alternative actions according
to what situation they will leave us with in addition to their initial cost.
Should we permit manufacturers to use foreign made components in everything
from cars to computers? This may permit some marginal financial savings
(or merely profit centralization). It may also, however, destroy our manufacturing
capability to support a major war in the future, which could be disastrous
from a national &quot;defense&quot; perspective. But then again, if everyone
was in a similar situation, it might be good for all!<BR>
<BR>
Compare, for example, what we see when we look at the endgame results of
natural gas vs. home insulation as an energy resource. Both may cost the
same over a twenty year period and have only minor environmental effects.
<BR>
<BR>
Yet at the end of the twenty years, expenditure on the fuel alternative
ends with no fuel, no insulation, and a furnace needing replacement, while
the home insulation alternative leaves us with a conservation resource in
place ready to continue &quot;supplying energy&quot; for twenty to a hundred
more years, <I>plus </I>still having the original fuel reserves for our
benefit. <BR>
<BR>
<B>ENDGAME: An irreplaceable resource was needlessly consumed or saved,
energy use for subsequent fifty years avoided or still needed. The financial
cost may have been the same, but the endgame position is totally different.</B><BR>
<BR>
Endgame positions can also be strongly affected by the <I>sequence</I> in
which choices are made . Compare two households, each anticipating purchasing
several expensive vacations plus a house over the next ten years. <I>The
household which purchases the vacations before the house ends up with memories,
and a house. The household which purchases the house before the vacations
ends up with memories, a house, </I>plus <I>perhaps $50-$60,000 in avoided
rental payments! <BR>
<BR>
</I><B>ENDGAME: Expenditures on durables before consumables reap enduring
benefits.</B><BR>
<BR>
Take this game one step further. Player A bought their house before vacations,
but bought a house with an expected use life of 50 years. Player B does
the same, but spends 20% more for a house which will last 400 years. Fifty
years later they both retire and sell their houses. Player A gets out just
before the roof falls in. Player B gets 90% of the entire investment back.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>ENDGAME: Durability pays. And pays. And pays.</B><BR>
<BR>
And what happens with Player C, who built a durable house, paid cash, and
built for energy efficiency? They set up an additional stream of events
which could result on a 75% savings in housing expenditures for themselves
and their descendents! (See &quot;The Hidden Cost of Housing&quot;,Tom Bender.
RAIN MAGAZINE, Mar/Apr 1984. Reprinted in UTNE READER, Summer 1984; SUN
TIMES, Nov/Dec 1984; ALTERNATIVE PRESS ANNUAL, 1984.)<BR>
<P><CENTER>* * *</CENTER>
<P><I>Endgame thinking can reveal how carefully we sometimes avoid looking
at the overall costs of our actions.</I> Ask yourself what you paid for
your house or car. Did you include the total financing cost in your answer?
Few people do. Do you even <I>know,</I> in dollars, how much the total financing
is going to cost you? <BR>
<BR>
Next time you vote, take a look at bond issue explanations on the ballot.
Odds are that they give just the <I>net </I>proceeds of the bond issue,
instead of telling you the <I>total </I>amount you are going to have to
pay to provide the net proceeds <I>plus </I>pay financing costs <I>plus
</I>tax avoidance makeup for taxfree bonds. <BR>
<BR>
You can make another check on your financial reality avoidance if you have
recently sold a house or some property. Ask yourself if you made a profit
on the sale. Then check if you made that conclusion by just comparing the
purchase and resale price. Examine what difference there is when you deduct
realtor's commissions, taxes, and financing charges while you owned it,
and compare the result to what you would have made in interest on the money
if you had put in the bank or invested it elsewhere.<BR>
<BR>
At its very least, endgame strategy offers opportunity for major financial
resource redirection from illusory benefits of debt financing into support
of expenditures which can give us lasting benefit as a society. <BR>
<P><CENTER>* * *</CENTER>
<P><B>Endgame strategy also suggests a range of actions which can help ensure
us the freedom to choose affordable ways of purchasing: </B><BR>
* <B>Require ballot information on the <I>total</I> cost of bond issues</B>
to encourage us to support revenue-financed alternatives. <BR>
<BR>
* Enact state statutes which <B>require or encourage <I>revenue</I> financing
for public capital improvements</B>.<BR>
<BR>
* Enact legislation to <B>protect state and local government entities from
being forced into debt financing</B> to pay for federally mandated projects.
<BR>
<BR>
* <B>Eliminate <I>tax-deductability</I> of corporate and personal debt service.</B>
<BR>
<BR>
* <B>Develop alternative auto financing institutions based on &quot;saving&quot;</B>
rather than repeated &quot;borrowing&quot;.<BR>
<P><CENTER>* * *</CENTER>
<P>Our new economic competitors are used to thinking in terms of hundred
and thousand year time increments and strategies which ensure their best
endgame situation over such time periods. It is time we began to do as well.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>Some Questions We Haven't Asked</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by <A HREF="../../PEOPLE/Bender.htm">Tom Bender</A></I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
Our first reaction when someone brings up the issues of depleting resources,
rampant ecological damage, overpopulation, and the need for &quot;changes&quot;
- is often fear. Fear of &quot;going back to the stone age&quot;, of shivering
in ragged blankets in a tarpaper shack with an empty stomach. That <I>might</I>
be a result if we continue to follow certain habits of thinking and acting,
but there are some unexpected and even exciting other possibilities in front
of us.<BR>
<BR>
Our greed/growth society and the sustainable one which we need to become
operate on totally different principles and values. They also generate fundamentally
different kinds of costs and rewards as well as immensely different effectiveness
in meeting life's needs. Looked at seriously, a sustainable society offers
some real surprises compared to our present one. Asking a few questions
about our present patterns suggests that alternatives might be easier than
expected.<B><BR>
<BR>
How much of our work and resources are we spending right now just to pay
the demands of growth? </B><BR>
<BR>
We currently invest immense amounts of our work, energy, and resources to
accommodate growth. Every generation we double the number of our houses,
cement plants, electrical generating plants, coal mines, cities, roads,
and water systems - and prematurely demolish existing ones - to accommodate
more people and more &quot;things&quot;. And we spend even more educating
and feeding those extra people. What do we gain, anyhow, from more people?<I><BR>
<BR>
Stabilizing growth <U>totally avoids</U> that expenditure.</I> And that
expenditure is significant - amounting to somewhere between 33% and 40%
of our total work. Avoiding that is equivalent to a gift of 2-3 hours a
day, 13-16 hours a week, or 16-21 weeks a year of free time to every person
- just for saying NO to more crowding and to jostling for belongings. Choosing
not to let our population expand or to have more per capita consumption
turns out to hold a massive reward to us as individuals and as a society.
<I><BR>
<BR>
Is it impossible to stabilize growth?</I> It really only requires a commitment
to do so. Other countries have stabilized their populations. China even,
has made the more difficult decision to <I>reduce</I> its population - aware
that it has more people than it can continue to feed. Many people familiar
with the problem say that economic equity and security, education, empowerment
of women, prevention of <I>unwanted</I> births, and reduction of the advertising,
promotion, and incentives for greater consumption are all that is needed
to achieve stabilization.<B><BR>
<BR>
How much of our work and resources go to pay for inequity? </B><BR>
<BR>
Another significant share of our resources is used to support inequity in
our society. The enormous concentration of wealth by a few in our society
consumes vast amounts of resources to benefit only those few. The median
US household income for wage-earners is currently $31,000, with more than
13% of households under the monetary poverty level of $15,000. A fully equitable
distribution of personal income would amount to $59,000 per household. <I><BR>
<BR>
An equitable society could totally eliminate poverty and support EVERYONE
at the current median income level of $31,000 per household. And surprisingly,
to do so would need 47% <U>less</U> work, and equivalently fewer resources
than our current society uses to maintain poverty and inequality!<BR>
<BR>
Is equity impossible? </I>It only requires reversing the tax breaks for
the wealthy foolishly approved over the last 30 years under the belief those
tax changes would help <I>us</I>! Instead, they have transferred massive
amounts of wealth from our pockets to the wealthy, and made us believe our
society is suddenly poor. In contrast, Great Britain changed their tax structure
towards equity after W.W.II, and moved from a far less equal society than
ours to one with far greater equity. Finland manages to live quite happily
with almost no income spread between poor and rich compared to ours.<B><I><BR>
<BR>
Without growth and inequity, <U>every</U> American could live as well as
the average American family does now. At the same time, we would save TWO-THIRDS
(67%) of the resources, work, and ecological damage involved. </I></B>And
this is without investing a dime in energy efficiency, improved industrial
processes, institutional change, or change in the kind of rewards we get
from life! <B><BR>
<BR>
What would we save just by living on income instead of in debt?</B><BR>
<BR>
To pay for growth, we have become trapped into paying for personal expenditures,
corporate expansion, and governmental infrastructure consistently through
debt purchasing. Our federal government is sinking ever deeper under a massive
and growing public debt and imbalance of trade. Just the interest on this
debt alone - not even to begin repaying the debt itself - represents a 25%
surcharge on other government expenditures. State and local governments
finance virtually all capital improvements - building schools, sewers, hospitals,
airports, highways, etc. through selling public bonds. These result in our
ultimately paying double or triple the apparent cost of those improvements.
These costs never appear, of course, in discussion of how much is being
borrowed.<BR>
<BR>
Our personal finance situations are as bad. Interest costs on home purchases
double and triple the actual cost of a home. We finance purchase of one
automobile after another for 40 or 50 years, gaining nothing out of the
process beyond the first purchase. Interest on continuing credit card balances
amounts to over $300 billion per year. We can't <I>buy</I> any more on credit.
We just end up <I>paying</I> more for what we buy - up to 20% more. Here
again, consumer debt represents 20% of disposable income. Corporate debt
loads represent a similar 25% surcharge. <B>Together, overall debt costs
represent more than 20% of our cost of living </B>- a cost which can be
drastically reduced.<I><BR>
<BR>
Is paying off the federal debt impossible?</I> A one-time, one or two year
excise tax on the wealthy could pay it off immediately. (That wealth represents
what was left over from having so much income they couldn't even spend it
all.) This would allow federal revenues to return to funding the programs
they were intended for rather than paying debt service. It seems appropriate
that those who can afford to contribute do so. It also seems appropriate
that those who made a killing from junk bonds, leverage buyouts, and Savings
and Loan and bank failures (which by themselves cost us taxpayers more than
W.W.II) pay part of the bailout cost to our government.<I><BR>
<BR>
Is cutting the cost of public capital improvements in half impossible?</I>
It would only take a law requiring the <I>repayment</I> cost of bond issues
be included in advertising of bond issues, and a law requiring public agencies
to project, prioritize, and pay for capital improvements out of revenues
rather than debt. Together, these could cut real financial costs of public
capital improvements by more than 50%.<I><BR>
<BR>
Is radical reduction in our consumer debt and interest costs impossible?</I>
Several states already regulate credit card interest rates to within a few
percent of prime interest. Japan prohibits carrying a continuous balance
on credit card use. Revolving loan funds can eliminate interest costs on
home purchases. Car savings plans can encourage savings for purchase rather
than paying interest on loan payments. Check out for yourself the difference
between using the same monthly payments to <I>save</I> to buy cars rather
than to <I>pay</I> to borrow the same money time after time.<B><BR>
<BR>
GREED AND GROWTH ALONE <I>QUADRUPLE</I> OUR COST OF LIVING!<BR>
<BR>
How much of our work and resources are needlessly wasted on inefficient
products and services? </B><BR>
<BR>
More efficient cars, homes, industrial processes and institutional operation
offer incredible magnitudes of savings. Well-documented research over the
last twenty years has shown and is beginning to produce <I>factor of ten</I>
savings (90% reduction) in energy and resources needed in a vast variety
of situations throughout society. <BR>
<BR>
This means two hundred mile-per-gallon cars, safer than today's, and totally
recyclable. They're due on the road in four to five years. It means homes
that require only sunlight and rainfall to operate. Prototypes are already
in operation in almost all of our climate zones. Water?.....today's toilets
and showers already have reduced water use 75% from fixtures only a few
years ago - and more improvements are on the way. Forestry practices are
available now - requiring no new technology - that maintain <I>all</I> forests
in old growth condition, while doubling timber production, increasing the
economic benefits from timber production nine-fold, and increasing total
forest value many times more. <BR>
<BR>
How about a higher education system with resources available - <I>free</I>
<I>to all, worldwide - </I>via satellite TV? Housing that costs only one-tenth
of today's, through improved durability, energy efficiency and financing
patterns? Industrial products with virtually zero ecological impact and
magnitude lower production costs? All these and more are immanent or already
being implemented today.<I><BR>
<BR>
Impossible? </I>It is already happening around us. Amory Lovin's <I>Natural
Capitalism</I> documents more than fifty examples. The work of the Wuppertal
Institute in Germany; the Rocky Mountain Institute's work on energy, water
and other issues; the work of John Todd in sewage treatment; Pliny Fisk
in building systems: and even my own work on forestry, education, housing,
energy, and transportation give further examples.<BR>
<BR>
Add these efficiency improvements to the benefits of a no-growth, equitable,
and debt-free society. That's ten percent of 80% of half of 66% of what
we now spend. <B><I>With these four changes alone, we would be operating
at a cost of only 2.6% of what we currently do! That's the equivalent to
only working 12 minutes a day to live as well as the average family does
now.</I></B><I> </I><BR>
<BR>
It is unlikely that we would ever follow such possibilities out to these
extremes - if for no other reason that we decide we <I>want</I> to work
more, or we <I>want</I> to do better for ourselves and all life, and ask
for higher levels of performance in all we do. But even if we decide to
only achieve two-thirds of each of these savings, that still adds up to
an 82% reduction from our present patterns - almost exactly what is projected
to be needed to operate on a sustainable basis.<BR>
<BR>
We've also looked at these questions briefly and in isolation. In reality
they are interactive. Some give resource savings but not financial or employment
ones. Others, as in any ecological system, have multiple and interactive
effects and savings. Hours worked would likely not drop to the equivalent
12 minutes a day, as these alternatives are often more employment intensive.
It is unlikely, though, that they would exceed one hour a day (13% of now).
What is important is that the savings possible are far more than enough
to totally transform a heretofor frightening prospect of change into an
opportunity for betterment of our lives in a variety of way!<BR>
<BR>
Just to be certain, let's add on a couple of less sweeping questions:<BR>
<BR>
<B>How much of our work is really unnecessary and could be avoided?</B><BR>
<BR>
Our patterns of large corporations and brand-name products and services
are not efficient producers. What they <I>are</I> efficient at is <I>centralizing</I>
profit into a few pockets. But if we eliminate the advertising that adds
$55 billion to the cost of our purchases, the shipping of things back and
forth, and all the hours of paper shuffling to manage such large enterprises,
the truth is what has been documented again and again. Local production
from local resources for local needs is considerably more efficient. <BR>
<BR>
More than half of the work done in our society is now &quot;white collar&quot;
- all of us in offices pushing papers. Like advertising and much of our
transportation, this does not represent &quot;real work&quot; like growing
food, building buildings, or caring for the sick. It's &quot;secondary&quot;
work. More direct patterns can avoid need for much of it, as well as being
more rewarding. And it actually feels good sometimes to get our hands dirty
and have the satisfaction of actually growing food, fixing a car, or doing
something needed by others.<B><BR>
<BR>
What hidden costs of our way of life don't we acknowledge?</B><BR>
<BR>
Our statistics try to tell us how well we are doing. Increases in expenditures
and incomes are lauded as increasing well-being. Yet having to spend more
on medical care can represent the cost of greater illness as easily as greater
care and resultant health. Transportation expenditures are as much a <I>cost</I>
of not being where we want to be as much as they are &quot;improvement in
mobility&quot;. How much of these costs could be <I>avoided</I>?<BR>
<BR>
And there are very important things we are so blinded to that we don't even
measure, and aren't aware of the connections between. We see crime, drug
and alcohol addiction, abuse, terrorist bombings, homelessness, and other
&quot;problems&quot; as puzzling, costly, and unsolveable separate issues.
Yet in reality they are all symptoms of the <I>same</I> disease - a disease
of the spirit arising from our ignoring the human, emotional, psychological
and spiritual dimensions of our lives. <BR>
<BR>
Our patterns of work, living, education - indeed all our base values and
institutions - prevent the healthy self-esteem, mutual respect, being of
value, joy, happiness, grief and pain which are inherent dimensions of a
healthy life. By taking rather than giving, by the overt and covert violence
of our agriculture, medicine, forestry, business management, and personal
relationships, we create immense hidden costs and damage to our lives. These
are not, of course, reflected in the indicators we focus on of what our
way of life <I>does</I> do successfully. But they show up as unanticipated
and costly problems elsewhere that we have to pay to deal with. Dealing
with their root causes can improve our quality of life as radically as reducing
our cost of living.<BR>
<BR>
Another simple way of achieving greater productivity is <I>sharing</I> the
results of our work rather than &quot;owning&quot; separately. Sharing often
has other benefits, and by extension, &quot;owning&quot; also has hidden
costs.<B><BR>
<BR>
Do we need current levels of government expenditures for police, criminal
justice, military research and operation and aid to the poor?</B><BR>
<BR>
If we eliminate poverty by creating an equitable society, we eliminate the
need for poverty programs. If we make an order of magnitude reduction in
our demands for resources, and help the rest of the world to do the same,
we dramatically reduce the need to fight over resources, or pay to send
troops to the Persian Gulf. Listed and unlisted military costs constitute
more than 30% of federal governmental expenditures, yet already the justification
for much of that has dissolved. Economic equity also eliminates much of
the desperation, fear and anger giving rise to crime. Restoration of self-esteem,
mutual respect, and being of value to our communities heals the diseases
of the spirit that lay behind our drug and alcohol addiction, spouse and
child abuse. These are some of the interconnected secondary benefits of
these actions.<BR>
<BR>
Three quarters of our prisons are filled from minor drug-related offenses.
It's clear, however, that Prohibition hasn't worked any better for marijuana
than for alcohol. (Every society seems to have demanded some means of taking
a break from everyday reality.) Separating the disease of addiction from
the crimes of trafficking heavy drugs, taking the profit out of drug sales,
and eliminating the economic and emotional poverty that underlies addiction
can accomplish more for our health and security than our massive expenditures
on jails, drug enforcement and crime programs.<B><BR>
<BR>
How much of our work and resources are wasted by not knowing our real goals
in life and chasing after illusory substitutes?</B><BR>
<BR>
At root, what we want out of life is to feel our lives are of value, that
we are successful in doing something meaningful. We want to be loved, respected,
and appreciated. We want to be a part of the joy of creation. We want to
feel deeply the power that arises out of meaningful relation with other
people and life.<BR>
<BR>
When our lives are split between &quot;producing&quot; and &quot;consuming&quot;,
when our work and our play do not give us those satisfactions, we end up
all too frequently letting expensive &quot;consumerism&quot;, shopping,
and the petty and transient feelings of happiness that they produce pinch-hit
for what we really want. These things we really want involve little of the
energy, resources, and work that are needed for the material possessions
we pile up around us. Monetary poverty is not the real poverty that poisons
our lives and society.<BR>
Our true rewards in life are the inherent result of meaningful patterns
of work and relationship and meeting the real needs of existence for ourselves
and others.<BR>
<P><CENTER>* * *</CENTER>
<P>With these magnitudes of changes possible, our conditioned first response
may well be, &quot;If there's that much slack, if we can do that much better,
what's wrong with our just continuing to grow?&quot; The answer is that
the magnitude of savings we are talking about also happen to be <I>necessary
- <U>now</U> - </I>to reduce our demands to levels which can be sustained.
Our lifestyles have been dependent upon tremendous consumption of finite
reserves of fossil fuels. We've already used up more than 60% of the entire
world's supply with most of the world's population only beginning to duplicate
our consumption patterns. <BR>
<BR>
With current projected growth in population and consumption, worldwide exhaustion
of oil is expected to take only 20-24 years. The first Arab state has already
run out of oil. Within a few years we will be faced with admitting our remaining
oil reserves are far more valuable as lubricants and industrial stock than
as fuels - and face enormous changes in our patterns. Continued growth ensures
a difficult transition at that point.<I><BR>
<BR>
No</I> finite world, however large, can continue to accommodate exponential
growth. We are already passing the limit of what ours can absorb without
total ecological breakdown. More people only make the problems far more
daunting, and the likelihood of major reduction in our material quality
of life far more probable. Providing leadership in the process of attaining
sustainable patterns rather than being dragged kicking and screaming into
the future can also hold immense benefit in a world where we are still firmly
interdependent with the lives, resources, and goodwill of others.<BR>
<P><CENTER>* * *</CENTER>
<P>Now, having to work only one hour a day to have what we currently have
(not quite shivering in the cold), what if we decide (gasp) that we DO want
some different rewards out of life? It's time to ask different questions:<B><BR>
<BR>
Is it possible that real improvement in our quality of life may depend on
our choosing a simpler material existence?</B><BR>
<BR>
It might. Simplicity <I>does</I> bring freedoms. &quot;Austerity&quot; really
means just getting rid of things that are in the way of our achieving the
goals we seek in life. Money, possessions, and the material dimensions of
life might just become less important to us. Part of that answer is determined
by what the biosystem, together with a little wisdom on our part, can support
without harm to the rest of creation. But it is important to keep this question
in front of us, because it is certain that simpler living <I>can</I> offer
important opportunities to us.<B><BR>
<BR>
If letting loose of our greed/growth/violence values offers such impressive
material benefits, what other benefits might it offer? </B><BR>
<BR>
Safety, for example. Security. Health. Rewarding work. Self-esteem and mutual
respect. Meaning. Deep connection with others. Harmony with the rest of
nature. Faith.<BR>
<BR>
I've discussed elsewhere, in <I>&quot;<A HREF="Skin.htm">Shedding A Skin
That No Longer Fits&quot;</A></I>, how change to sustainable patterns involves
a shift from a legalistic to a sacred basis for society. It involves release
from one of the greatest inner costs of our present values - the closing
off our hearts from other people and other life to protect us from the pain
of acknowledging the results of our actions. It entail giving play to our
vital <I>inner</I> resources in ensuring both our survival and having meaningful
and joyful lies. It encompass letting the energy that permeates and supports
all life flow through us and develop amazing and unprecedented new manifestations.
Even our material transactions change from &quot;taking&quot; to &quot;giving&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
These benefits of a sustainable society aren't even measurable in the terms
of material well-being used today. When we can meet our material needs as
easily as it appears we can, there is little need to even demean these benefits
by trying to represent them in terms of monetary value. If the immaterial
rewards of a sustainable, sacred society and gift economy are important
to us, we can devote <I>whatever</I> time and energy we want to achieve
them. Our material needs, in comparison, have become peripheral. <B><BR>
<BR>
What are the costs and benefits of sharing these new patterns with everyone
in the world?</B><BR>
<BR>
One intriguing aspect of these opportunities inherent in a sustainable society
is totally alien to our customary ways of thinking yet holds enormous potential
for our future. That is the &quot;giveability&quot; of many of these things.
Information, knowledge, and wisdom are a kind of wealth that need not be
hoarded like money. They can all be given away and shared freely without
depleting what we have - in fact often enhancing our knowledge or wisdom
in the process. <BR>
<BR>
Videotaped college lectures, for example, can be broadcast worldwide for
virtually the same cost of broadcasting them to one state or region. Shared
worldwide, and used year after year, they represent 100-fold cost savings,
and most simply can be given <I>free</I>. <BR>
<BR>
The cost and resource saving of building a high-efficiency refrigerator
or light bulb manufacturing plant rather than five electrical power plants
to supply energy for inefficient lights and refrigerators is merely newly
perceived common sense. That kind of common sense is applicable everywhere,
and can dramatically lessen our demands. <BR>
<BR>
The impressive savings possible from stabilizing populations, rather than
continuing massive investments to accommodate more people, are available
- and needed - in every country of the world. The benefits of equity are
a lesson of particular value to overdeveloped countries, but applicable
to all. And massive inequity is not unknown in even the poorest countries.
The costs of debt make it a wise thing for all to avoid.<BR>
<BR>
Our future is inexorably linked with the health and well being of all people
and all life. Asking these questions shows that we <I>can</I> easily reduce
our own excessive demands for the limited resources of our planet. We can
reduce them easily to levels which <I>can</I> be sustained for all, while
restoring the health of the rest of the biosphere. Through them, both our
own quality of life and that of everyone on the planet can be significantly
improved within those same limits of sustainability. <BR>

<BR>
Sustainable communities cannot be built upon automobile-centered transportation
systems. Land-use, economic, ownership and energy costs required are excessive,
even with projected 150 mpg cars. More central, however, is their inherent
tendency towards dispersal of our communities and isolation of our lives.<BR>
<BR>
Non-auto-centered transportation systems have two basis requirements for
success. They must be able to provide more freedom, convenience, and quality
of transportation than the automobile has offered. They must also be able
to reduce the negative aspects of an auto-centered culture such as the economic
costs, pollution, rush-hour congestion, driving stress, land use impacts,
and the hassles of car buying, servicing, parking, and selling.<BR>
<BR>
Pedestrian Pockets, Transit-Oriented-Developments, and Ecological Communities
will not become viable community options until they can realize the significant
financial, land use, and construction savings and gain the closer physical
connectivity attainable from major reduction in the amount of land devoted
to automobile movement and storage.<BR>
<BR>
Merely adding public transit to our existing auto-based communities also
<I>raises</I> rather than lowers overall transportation costs. Car ownership
and associated costs are not significantly reduced, nor are the hidden costs
of residential and commercial space devoted to car access and parking. Transit
is consequently used less than optimally, and becomes an investment <I>in
addition to</I> rather than <I>in place of</I> the automobile system.<BR>
<BR>
An effective integrated transportation system uses each mode of transportation
for its appropriate benefits, and allows users to <I>effortlessly</I> move
from one to another. Air travel is used for over-water and transcontinental
trips, high speed rail for regional movement, bus or light rail for inner
city and interurban travel. Bicycle and pedestrian travel is used for short
and unencumbered trips. Taxis, jitneys, vans, and <I>Rentalls</I> are used
for dispersed, off-hour, assisted, and inclement weather destinations and
travel. <BR>
<BR>
Most basic is <I>avoidance of need</I> for transportation - creating environments
and location of activities so we minimize the need to get away from them
or to use means other than walking to access them.<BR>
<BR>
Transportation system design needs to recognize that once an automobile
is at hand, and particularly once a person is <I>in</I> an automobile, its
convenience makes shifts to other modes unlikely, and gives no premium to
proximity of destinations. Real improvement in transportation needs to make
alternatives to the automobile available to us <I>before</I> an automobile
is at hand.<BR>
<BR>
One of the smaller yet vital elements necessary for the success of these
new patterns is a new approach to automobile rentals - or more accurately,
<I>&quot;Rent-alls&quot; </I>of all vehicle types. Where our automobile
needs can be reduced to an occasional level of use, ownership becomes less
important than the actual availability, convenience, and cost of having
cars when needed. A hassle-free rental system can offer freedom from the
costs and physical space commitments that car ownership entails.<I><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Rentalls </I>are public-transit-linked vehicle rentals, providing a range
of vehicle types and conditions of vehicles, accessible at all primary transit
hubs and stations. A successful <I>Rentall</I> system contains a number
of elements different from conventional car rentals: 
<UL>
  <LI>Automated, instant and hassle-free rental process directly integrated
in primary transit stops, air, rail and bus terminals.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Reservation and confirmation of vehicle availability from home, transit
stop, or enroute on transit systems. If desired vehicle is not immediately
available at the desired stop, the closest alternate location is given before
the transit trip is started.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>&quot;Transit Card&quot; operation serving all modes of transit including
vehicle rental, eliminating cash and i.d. problems, permitting discounts,
and giving users accurate total costing of their transportation use and
providing monthly information access to users.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>&quot;Gas Pump&quot; car insurance, if available in the state, reducing
insurance costs and separating driving insurance from ownership of vehicles.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Rentals available on an hourly, daily, or weekly basis, with charges
set on a combined time-mileage basis. Including fuel costs eliminates &quot;tank-refilling&quot;
issues and provides incentive for fuel economy.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>A range of available vehicle types, ages, and service conditions -
including bicycles and hand carts. 
</UL>
<BR>
Adding neighborhood <I>Rentall</I> vehicle rental facilities to transit
stops creates significant advantages and new opportunities: 
<UL>
  <LI>The ability to access dispersed destinations through a transit-centered
system is enhanced, increasing ridership levels.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Both neighborhood residents and transit users have the opportunity
to select different vehicles - subcompacts, convertibles, luxury sedans,
pickups, vans,etc. - depending on each specific trip need.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Car rental costs and storage needs are reduced through balancing weekday
and workhour rental needs with evening and weekend uses.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Automation of the rental process and reduction of &quot;esthetic servicing&quot;
(wash and vacuum) between each use permits dispersal of rental locations
for convenient neighborhood access.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Different age and condition of vehicles can be chosen - rent-a-wreck,
standard car rental, rent-a-Rolls - with commensurate cost savings.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Economies of scale lower costs and omit hassles of private vehicle
purchase, maintenance, and operation.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Market development opportunities are created for 150 mpg urban cars,
or electric vehicles charged from off-hour hydroelectric flows<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Second-car ownership needs and costs can be drastically impacted,
and primary car ownership to a lesser degree by making vehicle rental accessible,
affordable, and hassle-free.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Demand for single- and multi-car garages and driveway space on residential
properties can be reduced. Existing garages can be converted to income-producing
rental apartments.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Parking areas at transit stops and in commercial area can be reduced,
as &quot;commuter&quot; cars are re-rented during working day for &quot;shoppers&quot;
and &quot;day-trippers&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Parking congestion on city streets can be lessened.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Mobility for low-income families can be improved and costs lowered.
</UL>
<BR>
An integrated transportation system, with convenient linkages between modes,
and utilizing both the ease and cost savings of public transit and the flexibility
of car rental can offer real advantages to all kinds of transportation users:
<UL>
  <LI>Central city residents can live their whole life without owning a
car. Use of taxies as well as public transit daily, and car rental for special
trip needs can still offer considerable savings as well as convenience in
areas where residential parking spaces cost $10- $50,000 and vandalism and
car insurance costs make car ownership a headache.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Suburban commuters can depend on transit commuting, with the assurance
that in-town cars are readily and affordably available if needed for mid-day
errands or changes in plans.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>We can travel to unfamiliar destinations by plane, train, and transit,
with the security of knowing that vehicles will be available when and where
wanted for specific needs.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Business travelers can use public transit totally for all but dispersed
destinations, allowing travel time to be used for work, rest or relaxation,
while having vehicles conveniently available to reach dispersed destinations.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Transit-Oriented-Development residents can avoid all but foot and
bicycle transportation for most needs, eliminating car ownership, and yet
having a variety of vehicles available when need for their use arises. 
</UL>
<BR>
Incrementally, a move is beginning towards <I>Rentalls</I>. A San Francisco
condominium keeps a fleet of rental cars for its residents. Europeans are
developing car-sharing cooperatives. Tourists in Europe can now get a Eurailpass
for rail travel between cities combined with car rentals in individual cities.
A transportation system, however, must give assurance of systemwide <I>Rentall</I>
availability to gain the real benefits of such services.<BR>

SUMMARY</H4>
Forestry, like many social issues, has become caught in a gridlock between
those who wish to preserve a resource and those who want to maximize the
immediate benefits from it. Fortunately, a new perspective is now emerging
which appears to offer substantial benefits to all parties.<BR>
<BR>
New scientific evidence indicates that proper long-rotation forestry, with
cut cycles from 180 to 240 years, can provide dramatic increases in timber
and financial yields, while restoring the ecological health of the forest
system. <I>(Wigg, Mark, 1989, &quot;The Economics of Sustainable Forestry&quot;,
Society of American Foresters.)</I><BR>
<BR>
The non-timber economic value of other uses of the mature and healthy forests
resulting from such cut cycles can also significantly exceed the timber
value, adding even more to the economic benefit of these forest management
practices.
<UL>
  <LI><B>TIMBER sustainable yields possible with long rotations can DOUBLE
current yields</B>,<B> while providing an amazing NINE-FOLD increase in
net economic returns from timber production. </B><I>(Wigg, M. Ibid.;<B>

revenues. </B>(Ibid.)<B> <BR>

</UL>
<B><I><BR>
</I></B><HR><B><I>NEW CONCLUSIONS ABOUT FORESTRY MANAGEMENT</I></B><BR>
<BR>
Recent scientific studies have shown several vital elements of forestry
practices that have been ignored in earlier management practices: 
<UL>
  <LI><B>Timber production per acre of Oregon coastal forests,</B> particularly
with commercial thinning, <B>does not drop off significantly beyond the
traditional CMAI point </B>for many, many years. <CITE>(Curtis, Robert O.,
1994, &quot;Some Simulation Estimates of Mean Annual Increment of Douglas-Fir&quot;
USFS Research Paper PNW-RP-471.)</CITE> Harvest cycles can be extended several
times the conventional 60 year rotations while still staying quite near
the maximum productivity. Such practices, in fact, often produce <I>increase</I>
rather than decrease in net timber yield. They also typically produce a
higher percentage of high value wood in larger logs. <I>(Haynes, Richard
W., and Fight, Roger D., 1992, &quot;Price Projections for Selected Grades
of Douglas Fir....&quot; USFS Research Paper PNW-RP-447. Newton, M. and

</B>
  <LI><B>Long-rotation timber harvest can sustain timber yields that would
otherwise be lost </B>from the disease, nutrient loss, soil losses, and
fungal destruction of current timber management practices. <I>(Ingham, Elaine,
1994, &quot;Soil Organisms and Forest Health&quot;, Headwaters Journal.)<BR>
</I><B><BR>
</B>
  <LI><B>Extreme health impacts to humans</B>, fish and wildlife <B>have
recently been shown to result from the use of organo-chloride compounds</B>
such as employed in present management practices. <I>(Colborn, Theo and
Clement, Coralie, Chemically-Induced Alterations in Sexual and Functional
Development: The Wildlife / Human Connection, Princeton Scientific Publiching
Co., 1992.)<BR>
</I><B><BR>
</B>
  <LI><B>Management costs have a major impact on net economic yield.</B>
They occur largely during the cut/replant/early growth part of the cycle.
Longer rotations which eliminate these cycles of management costs produce
far greater net economic returns. <I>(Wigg, M. Op. Cit.)<BR>
</I><B><BR>
</B>
  <LI><B>Northwest Oregon coastal forests have exceedingly high risk of
erosion causing soils loss impacting both timber and fisheries. Long rotations
dramatically lessen soils disturbance and loss affecting fisheries and timber
production and their revenues. </B><I>(&quot;Tillamook Bay Drainage Basis

<BR>
The <A HREF="ForestTb.htm">accompanying table</A>, excerpted from &quot;The
Economics of Sustainable Forestry&quot; presented by Mark Wigg to the Society
of American Foresters, 1989, summarizes the impacts of many of these issues
on the timber yield and net economic return of forests with different rotation
lengths. Several factors make the long rotations far more profitable:
<UL>
  <LI>Higher stumpage prices paid for larger logs, reflecting more high
value wood. 
  <LI>Larger harvest volumes - 60 yr. rotations cut stands before CMAI.
Long rotation harvests almost twice as many board feet and 25% more cubic
feet than short rotation. 
  <LI>The largest reason for greater profits is that costs are reduced.
Sixty year rotations require three times the site preparation, planting,
release, thinning, and sales management as does a 180 year rotation. 
</UL>
<B><I><BR>
FUTURE NEEDS, FORESTRY PRACTICES, AND MARKETS</I></B><BR>
<BR>
Long range trends indicate a strong directionality towards greater future
value of our forestry resources. There is a strong probability, for example,
that there will be a larger population of Oregonians in the future desiring
and needing to benefit from forest productivity and the financial value
of that productivity. There is a strong probability that there will be a
larger world population competing for a smaller base of available timber
and forest resource products, and that the future value of those products
will be greater than their present value. 
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Trends and forestry practices here and abroad indicate substantial
competitive benefit in an Oregon focus on higher quality product and sustainable
long-rotation practices with lower costs, higher sustainable harvest rates,
and far greater profits. At minimum, they suggest not discounting future
benefits in favor of immediate gain.</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<B><BR>
US</B> - Timber harvests on many Oregon commercial forests have been increased
to as much as 5% of holdings cut per year. This represents a twenty year
total liquidation of the forest on those lands, major community disruption
during a minimum 40 year wait until timber can again be harvested, and an
order of magnitude increase in forest and fisheries stress. Such practices
represent liquidation of the timber asset to pay corporate takeover costs,
not forest practices necessary for either sustained yield, maximum economic
benefit, or forest health. Such overcutting is rapidly depleting our state
and national inventory of merchantable timber, which will result in an expanded
future market for timber owners who will have timber available during such
shortages.<B><BR>
<BR>
GERMANY</B> - Reports from 1993 visits to Germany and discussion with foresters
there indicated that Germany has moved largely to a mixed crop timber rotation
in the neighborhood of 250 years. The foresters indicated that &quot;present-value&quot;
analysis is considered worthless in their analysis. They noted that Germany's
currency has dropped to zero value twice in the last 80 years, and that
fluctuation in interest rates give a false picture of forest productivity.
Standing timber has repeatedly shown itself to be of greater value than
the cash obtained from premature harvest. German forests have also suffered
decreasing productivity from repeated harvesting (Plochman, 1968) which
is potentially tied to loss of soil fungal health.<B><BR>
<BR>
JAPAN </B>- Visits in 1991 and 1994 to forests in the Nagano, Shizuoka,
Yamanashi, Miyagi, and Kyoto Prefectures resulted in surprising conclusions
about current Japanese forestry practices. With the world currency market
favoring raw log imports from the U.S., it was supposed that Japanese foresters
were taking advantage of the opportunity to restock and maximize standing
timber growth available for future harvests. This proved not to be the case.<BR>
Observations repeated showed, with the exception of one temple-owned forest
in Kyoto, that forest management was virtually non-existent. Forest areas
were covered with shrubs and non-merchantable tree species. The land owners
indicated that with timber prices depressed, they could not afford to put
people into the forests to improve forest management.<B><BR>
<BR>
WORLD </B>- A recent study indicated that accelerated timber harvesting
for immediate financial benefit is rapidly destroying the sustainable yield
of forests worldwide. In ten years, only a few countries will be left with
export capability, with a yearly production of only a fraction of current
board ft/yr.<B><I><BR>
<BR>
WHO SHOULD GET THE PROFITS FROM BETTER FOREST PRACTICES?</I><BR>
<BR>
Counties and other taxing districts would be wise to press for re-examination
of the current legislative framework that grants ODF roughly 35% of forestry
revenues for management costs.</B> This framework needs to be re-examined
for several reasons:
<UL>
  <LI><B>The management cost agreement on other similar Oregon public forests
is less </B>(31% for Common School Fund Lands). This indicates that at least
a 12% reduction could be argued even under current practices.<BR>
<B><BR>
</B>
  <LI><B>This management cost ratio has covered management costs on <I>all</I>
state-managed lands without the Tillamook Forest,</B> representing about
70% of state-managed lands, producing significant revenue for the last 50
years due to the Tillamook Burn. With <I>all</I> forest lands producing
revenue, reducing the management fee from 35% to 10.5% (a 70% reduction)
would produce the same revenues.<BR>
<B><BR>
</B>
  <LI><B>Increases in timber values</B> in recent years <B>is providing
substantially more revenue without commensurate increase in management costs.</B>
A lower management ratio, even with no change in practices or costs, would
provide equivalent revenues.<BR>
<B><BR>
</B>
  <LI><B>Long-term rotation represents major savings (up to 75%) in management
costs. </B>This savings, if accruing to the counties and taxing districts,
would represent a 40% increase in their revenues. It can well be argued,
particularly with the magnitude of change in net economic yield that long-rotation
harvest represents, that such savings should be passed on to the counties
and other beneficiaries rather than being retained in ODF coffers. A nine-fold
increase in net economic return represents a several-fold increase in ODF
revenues, and major increase in ODF revenue excess over costs. 
</UL>
<BR>
Renegotiation of the management fees thus could result in a substantially
greater <B><I>proportion</I></B> of net revenues from long-rotation forestry
benefiting these counties and taxing districts as well as the greater net
revenues themselves. <B><I><BR>
<BR>
HOW CAN WE MAKE A TRANSITION TO LONG ROTATION FORESTRY? </I></B><BR>
<BR>
One workable strategy is the policy adopted by the County Board of Supervisors
in Mendicino County CA. It permits annual harvests of 1.75% or 2% of standing
forest inventory per year. With a young forest stand, wood production exceeds
this, allowing an actual increase in harvest each year until growth rates
reach and stabilize near the maximum annual increment. It thus permits a
simple transition from short rotation clear cutting to a long rotation forest
management. <I>(Burkhardt, Hans, &quot;Maximizing Forest Productivity&quot;,
Mendicino County CA&quot;, 1993.)<B><BR>
<BR>
PENNY WISE AND POUND FOOLISH?</B></I><BR>
<BR>
Why have current management practices so totally miscalculated the value
of management alternatives? One reason is that they have ignored the impacts
of practices in one area (timber production) on the productivity of other
areas (fisheries and recreation, for example). Secondly, they have employed
measurements which stress the benefits of maximizing immediate gain from
overharvesting timber while failing to incorporate the much greater total
benefits of other practices generating a larger and more sustainable revenue
flow.<BR>
<BR>
The use of &quot;present value accounting&quot; (PNV) to determine management
plans for public forests is a clear example of measuring the wrong things.
Such &quot;precise&quot; calculations give a false appearance of the true
state of public forest management, concealing things like the $5.6 billion
loss of taxpayer dollars by Forest Service over the last decade from subsidizing
of logging sales.New York Times, &quot;How Most of the Public Forests are
Sold to Loggers at a Loss,&quot; Nov. 3, 1991. Even on Oregon forests, most
PNV analysis incorporating expenditures shows negative financial benefit!
In addition to the direct financial losses, subsidized timber production
from public lands results in major losses in the value of timber owned by
private woodlot owners.<BR>
<BR>
The use of PNV is an improper tool for management of public timber lands.
Its basic concept of ignoring the value of revenues in future years is contrary
to the ongoing revenue and economic productivity needs of public ownership.
Public agencies cannot accept analysis techniques and subsequent management
practices that result in loss of 90% of potential revenues. It is absolutely
contrary to the legislative mandate of ODF-managed lands, which requires
that ODF <B><I>&quot;secure the highest permanent usefulness to the whole
people of the state.&quot; </I></B><BR>
<BR>
PNV provides, as shown above, small increases in immediate revenues at the
cost of major revenue loss in later years. It assumes interest rates on
&quot;investments&quot;, when no investments are being made. By starting
with the costs associated with a bare acre of land, it assumes replanting
costs to be unavoidable. When we look at the alternative of longer rotations,
we see those major costs <I>are</I> avoidable. In maximizing immediate rather
than total financial return, PNV almost invariably causes timber to be cut
before it reaches its maximum cumulative average growth.<BR>
<BR>
Proper assessment of management alternatives requires examination of <I>all</I>
revenue sources, associated <I>costs</I> as well as income, and the interaction
and effects of management practices of one area on the productivity of other
areas. With such assessment, the true value of alternatives such as long
rotation forestry become quite clear.<BR>

</H1>

</H4>
<BR>
The basic structure of our higher education system has been unchanged since
before the printing press was invented. An estimated two-thirds of undergraduate
credit hours uses a classroom lecture-style structure. In it an instructor
covers virtually the same material as in the texts used. The same coverage
is repeated by other instructors in other sections, other years, and other
institutions. This is highly wasteful of both faculty and financial resources,
as well as student time. It ignores the opportunity for using more effective
resources and processes.<BR>
<BR>
Things are beginning to change - albeit in piecemeal fashion. A growing
range of learning resources and for-profit training programs are developing
using video tapes, audio tapes, and computer programs, as well as written
materials. More than 100 colleges now offer at least partial non-residency
degree work, and credit for non-academic experience. More students are finding
more effective learning alternatives to a college education - both because
of cost and relevance. Public and private funding sources are questioning
the return on investment in higher education.<BR>
<BR>
In this situation is opportunity for major improvement in our public higher
education system as well as the danger of starving a system which has performed
well, even if it has not taken advantage of substantial new opportunities.<BR>
<BR>
The following outlines a procedure for gradual or rapid modification of
our existing system. This procedure would allow our system to become user-
rather than supplier-oriented, to evolve into a resource for life-long learning,
to develop global market capabilities, and to achieve an order of magnitude
improvement in financial effectiveness:<BR>
<BR>
<U><B>I. ACCREDITING LEARNING ACHIEVEMENT </B></U><BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>PROPOSAL ONE: Separate the process of testing knowledge and
accomplishment in academic fields from completing resident college courses.</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DL>
  <DD>Knowledge and accomplishment increasingly comes from a variety of
sources beyond traditional college classrooms. Separating accrediting of
learning achieved from the taking of residency courses has been the successful
basis of many European higher education systems for years. Over one hundred
schools in the U.S. - running the gamut of credibility - now offer degrees
by home study. The New York State <I>Regents Credit Bank</I> provides credible
evaluation of academic records and equivalency examinations available to
people anywhere in the world. 
  <DL>
    <DD><BR>
    <DD>CLEP (College-Level Examination Program), and PEP (Proficiency Examination
Program) together currently administer standardized equivalency examinations
in more than seventy-five course areas, at a cost of from $30-$125 per course.
These programs could be expanded or supplemented to cover other areas or
evaluation techniques.
    <DD><BR>
    <DD>Both self-testing and outside-testing needs to be included. Self-testing
to ensure effectiveness and thoroughness of learning, and outside-testing
for validation to others. A clear program of equivalency testing and accreditation
encourages students to find diverse and cost-effective ways to learn and
puts the emphasis properly on the learning achieved itself.
  </DL>
</DL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B><BR>
</B><U><B>II. JOB COMPETENCY CERTIFICATION</B></U>
<UL>
  <DL>
    <DT><B>PROPOSAL TWO: Develop or expand, where needed, certification
programs for new workers in various fields, combining accredited academic
courses, work experience, apprentice training, oral examinations as pertinent.</B>
    <DD>Few would claim that <I>either</I> resident academic training or
equivalency exams ensure the necessary training for many fields of work.
Certification separate from academic training is required in a wide variety
of fields. Improved certification requirements combined with supervised
apprentice programs can offer a meshing of academic study, work training,
and income for students preparing for work in various fields.
  </DL>
</UL>
Together, these first two proposals separate the learning process from the
process of demonstrating competency in subject areas. In doing so, they
shift the learning process into an environment of competitive vitality where
new options can prove themselves. Students can choose ones appropriate to
their particular needs, and can develop the initiative for self-motivated
learning.<BR>
<BR>
<U><B>III. ACCESS TO LEARNING RESOURCES </B></U>
<UL>
  <DL>
    <DT><B>PROPOSAL THREE: Replace the &quot;live&quot; lecture format of
50% of undergraduate college courses with a high quality videotape medium
</B>
    <DD>With the average American now having spent more hours in front of
a TV before entering kindergarten than is needed to earn a college degree,
the medium cannot be ignored as a potential learning environment. Videotapes
of college lectures can provide a roughly comparable experience at a small
fraction of the cost, and with greater ease of access. Development of high-quality
video presentations, such as the PBS Planet Earth series, can frequently
provide a better learning experience than the standard lecture format.
    <DD><BR>
    <DD>Beginning video development with introductory courses in each field
and moving into more advanced areas would allow greatest numerical impact
early in the program. The project could begin with &quot;talking head&quot;
taping of present lectures. After the first year, it could be self-funding
through using released staff time or staff funding to develop improved,
higher quality videos. Additional funding could be sought from federal education
funds, from a consortium of state higher education systems, from PBS, or
foundation sources.
    <DD><BR>
    <DD>The program could be incrementally implemented, and can be easily
updated, augmented, selected for specific use by individuals and academic
programs.<I></I>
    <DD><I><BR>
</I>
    <DD><I>(A growing number of technologies are developing which may offer
potential application in specific subject or process areas. Some are proven,
some quite untested. For simplicity's sake, we focus here on only one -
videotapes. This is a familiar, proven, and understandable technology, so
we can more clearly focus on the elements necessary to generate an effective
system. We could equally well include books, fax, computers or tele-conferencing
as parts of the technological medium, but the simple video element will
demonstrate some particularly valuable attributes. In practice, other technologies
would be added and incorporated as their benefit is proven.)</I>
    <DT><B><BR>
PROPOSAL FOUR: Develop satellite broadcast/cable TV/VCR distribution for
instant global availability.</B>
    <DD>This distribution system multiplies market access exponentially
at extremely low cost. Such &quot;free&quot; service can be balanced by
marketing opportunities for testing services, books, workbooks, etc., improved
global credibility, marketing opportunity for non-video residency courses,
and bringing globally qualified students into Oregon.
    <DD><BR>
    <DD>With VCR's, broadcasts need not be synchronized with time zones
and viewing times, or be dependent upon &quot;registered student&quot; status.
Access for continuing education would become automatic. Performance and
lessons from existing satellite systems such as those in Alaska and India
should be reviewed, as well as Astronaut Rusty Schweickart's proposal for
a low-cost education satellite system. 
    <DD><BR>
    <DD>With satellite access, program libraries may be developed at any
remote location, or programs adapted and modified to local needs and conditions.<BR>
<BR>
    <DT><B>PROPOSAL FIVE: Develop the videos in separate visual / caption
/ verbal &quot;overlays&quot; to permit optimum reformatting for marketing
in other languages.</B>
    <DD>The low cost of reformatting rather than producing new programs
would give first marketed programs a significant edge in for-profit capturing
other language markets, as well as lower overall costs.
    <DT><B><BR>
PROPOSAL SIX: Develop a multi-track international process for developing
videos in order to stimulate quality competition.</B>
    <DD>1. In-house planning and production of tapes (particularly at beginning
to set quality standards.
    <DD>2. Purchase of programs, tapes, etc. for as-is or modified use.
    <DD>3. Competitions for new programs, proposals, etc.
    <DD>4. Awards for most successful programs.
    <DD>5. Both peer-group and independent processes for planning and review
of programs.
    <DD>6. Contract production and/or planning under in-house review.<BR>
<BR>
    <DT><B>PROPOSAL SEVEN: Develop a family of &quot;gate-keepers&quot;
and other techniques to facilitate effective access to the resources desired.</B>
    <DD>Too large a selection of resources can be intimidating and consume
too much time and effort in selecting an appropriate resource. Experience
has shown the importance of respected reference sources for &quot;best book
or tape in the field&quot;, for what areas should be studied to prepare
for specific interests, and for giving a taste of what reviewed resources
have to offer. The Whole Earth Catalog, Literary Reviews, certain mail book
catalogs, and newsletters in various fields have demonstrated the value
of such &quot;gatekeepers&quot; and how to perform that function well.
    <DD><BR>
    <DD>Video programs should include tables of contents / indexes at the
beginning of the tapes, on boxes, and available separately to simplify access
and review of specific segments.
  </DL>
</UL>
<B><BR>
</B><U><B>IV. RESEARCH</B></U><I><BR>
<BR>
The present academic structure provides partial funding for university staff
to do personal research. Such research is often vital, and should not be
eliminated by the inevitable development of lower cost delivery of learning
resources.<BR>
</I>
<UL>
  <DL>
    <DT><B>PROPOSAL EIGHT: Develop a prioritization and funding process
for public supported research. </B>
    <DD>Priorities and funding should be developed separately by the State,
by universities, by academic discipline, by problems, and by geographic
area.<BR>
<BR>
    <DT><B>PROPOSAL NINE: Develop a dated on-line index to:</B>
    <DL>
      <DT><B>A: Research in progress</B>
      <DD>Prevent unnecessary duplication. Encourage &quot;networking&quot;
of people working in related areas. Provide medium for interconnecting projects.
Provide opportunity for public dialog on most effective avenues of research.
      <DT><B>B: &quot;Research needed&quot; proposals</B>
      <DD>Person suggesting research and its potential benefit would establish
priority for the idea and get equal credit for its results. List could be
used to develop funding. Others could propose alternate research to achieve
the same ends.
    </DL>
<B><BR>
</B>
    <DT><B>PROPOSAL TEN: Develop a &quot;sabbatical funding&quot; process
for 'support' of non-funded research. </B>
    <DD>This should not be limited to academic personnel.
  </DL>
</UL>
<B><BR>
</B><U><B>V. OBTAINING BENEFITS FOR OREGON </B></U>
<UL>
  <DL>
    <DT><B>PROPOSAL ELEVEN: Refocus existing state campuses and academic
communities to:</B>
    <DD>A: Focus on residency-needed courses requiring hands-on studio work,
interactive study, tutorials, labs, language, co-learner groups, field trips,
research frontiers and graduate programs. Live lecture courses where other
resource access is available should be charged at full cost. A &quot;Community
of Learners&quot; should be sought rather than a faculty/student structure.
    <DD>B. Develop student-based access, study groups, tutorial aid, etc.
to supplement print and electronic resources.
    <DD>C. Attract the best foreign students, and create a strong focus
on international and intercultural training for global employment opportunities
and education needs.
    <DT><B><BR>
PROPOSAL TWELVE: Develop Oregon business opportunities relative to the program.</B>
    <DD>A. Develop programs to give opportunities to and retain such students
in the Oregon economy.
    <DD>B. Expand education videotape industry in Oregon, with a process
for drawing in experts to participate in specific tape development, and
means to benefit academic and businesses from their visits.
    <DD>C. Develop or expand local participation in testing and certification
programs.
    <DT><B><BR>
PROPOSAL THIRTEEN: Review resource allocation</B>
    <DD>Making more effective learning resources available releases financial
resources for reallocation. That decision is a public and political one,
but the boundaries within which reallocation can occur include:
    <DL>
      <DD>A. Funding reduction
      <DD>B. Fee reductions and wider access to more students
      <DD>C. Increased faculty research time
      <DD>D. More individualized teaching, course research, etc.
      <DD>E. New courses and programs
    </DL>
  </DL>
</UL>
<I><BR>
</I>Together these proposals establish the framework for a more flexible,
dynamic and cost-effective higher education system which acknowledges and
builds upon the proven successes of our present system. This framework allows
the expanding variety of learning processes available to us today to take
their proper place beside the traditional process of classroom lecture.
It recognizes the opportunities and challenges of our new global society,
and helps Oregon carve out a viable role in that society. Perhaps most importantly,
it demonstrates that learning is something that can be shared with everyone,
with benefits to all.<BR>
<P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="30%"></CENTER>
<P>The current willingness to propose drastic cuts in various public services
is tied to an unspoken assumption that we as a culture are suddenly poor,
and can no longer afford education, health care, etc. That root assumption
itself is untested and unverified. It is more likely that much of our wealth
has just been diverted from its accustomed channels into different pockets.
At worst, our <I>effective</I> wealth can easily be maintained and/or regained
through non-intrusive changes. This issue should be examined before making
harmful cuts in services.<BR>
<BR>
It is also important in considering proposals for change in our higher education
system that we look beyond just cost reduction. There is important opportunity
today to reach higher and achieve more - and through it to <I>also</I> achieve
more cost-effective operation. If we don't, others will, and will compete
against our system to our disadvantage.<BR>
<BR>
Public funding of higher education performs a number of functions.:
<UL>
  <LI>Scholastic aid - making education accessible to a greater portion
of the state's students than could otherwise afford it.
  <LI>Research - making possible unfunded faculty research
  <LI>Services to the state and its economy
  <LI>Training of an effective workforce
</UL>
<BR>
Most &quot;radical&quot; education proposals do not improve the efficiency
of education. They commonly involve restriction or elimination of one of
the above functions. While a few percent or possibly tens of percent of
improvement is possible from more effective administration or business practices,
it appears that only proposals which incorporate as well appropriate structural
and technological change can have any hope of truly significant impact.
<BR>
<BR>
Assuming each university lecture course is offered only once yearly, even
a &quot;talking head&quot; videotape program could represent up to a 90%
elimination of resource waste over a ten year period. Multiplying that by
the number of universities in the world gives a rough projection of the
potential resources that could be released to more effective use.<BR>
<BR>
The development of alternative learning resources and access routes is burgeoning
today, and will force changes in higher education without the opportunity
to properly address the full range of issues involved. For-profit learning
modules are unlikely to provide the depth of academic freedom, currency
of information, and open dialog of a system that incorporates all participants
in its design and operation. Likewise, student-initiated taping and renting
of college lectures will open a rats-nest of issues of ownership of information
that can better be addressed in a constructive and comprehensive dialog.
And any system of higher education that fails to take leadership in addressing
these issues will soon find itself a discredited and forgotten bystander
as our education system moves into the 21st century.<BR>
<P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="30%"></CENTER>
<P><I>Education is the basis of success in the coming century. Its vitality,
effectiveness, affordability and appropriateness need to be ensured and
expanded if we are to be among the successful.</I><BR>

<UL>
  <LI>This framework outlines the dimensions of change necessary to move
our industrialized societies and our built environment into patterns which
are sustainable both internally and in relationship with the natural systems
which envelop and support us.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>It has shown dramatic savings (75-90% in many areas) possible in the
real financial and economic costs of supporting our communities. Those savings,
and the resources they release, can make our living patterns affordable
and also available to the entire world.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Sustainable energy and material use, efficient land use and buildings
are necessary. Alone, however, they are not sufficient to create sustainable
communities.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Institutional and value changes are even more basic requirements for
sustainability. They provide unexpected opportunities and rewards for both
architecture and society.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>The emotional, symbolic, and artistic dimension of our surroundings
are vital to nurture of our minds, spirits, and will. They give the deeper
meaning, richer impact, and connection inescapeably needed for sustainablity.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Our spiritual connection with our surroundings, other cultures, and
natural systems is key to sustainability. Peace, harmony and meaning - with
our dreams, with our neighbors, and with our surroundings, are crucial to
any sustainable community.

<H2>INSTITUTIONS</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Wealthy societies inevitably generate inefficient institutions.
Restructuring them can release vast resources for other needs, and expand
the effectiveness and availability of their services. Physically, this permits
better facilities for various institutions, &quot;better fitting&quot; design
, and surroundings that reflect back to us better values and a true sense
of aptness.<BR>

  <DT><B>MEET GLOBAL NEEDS WITH WASTED INSTITUTIONAL RESOURCES </B>
  <DD>Large institutional and economic systems are good at channeling power
and profits into fewer pockets. Simpler, more localized, fine-tuned patterns
are usually better and more sustainable at meeting our needs and generating
real wealth. Documentation in many areas - agriculture, building, communications,
health, shelter, energy, waste recycling, community building and appropriate
technology shows the viability and benefits of more sustainable, localized
patterns.

  <DT><B>SEEK WISDOM, NOT DEGREES; SHARE KNOWLEDGE WITH ALL</B> 
  <DD>Cost savings for a statewide higher education system of 50-70% can
be gained by replacing redundant lecture courses with videocassettes, making
offerings available globally through satellite / videotape media, and separating
the process of university educational certification from providing learning
opportunities. Multi-lingual global application would give a 25 to 50-fold
decrease in the cost of higher education. Proposal currently under consideration

  <DD>Restoring the health and productivity of over-exploited soils, forests,
fisheries, agricultural lands, water and energy resources can provide astounding
economic returns as well as improving the sustainability base of our communities.
The State of California's highly successful &quot;Investing for Prosperity&quot;
program has become a model being implemented in other states and countries
to productively invest in restoration and improvement of natural resources.
$5 million which was invested in reforestation alone has been projected
to provide 18,000 jobs, $448 million in timber sales, and $104 million in
increased tax revenues over the next 50-75 years.

enjoyment and lives in the process. Savings come in many forms - embodied
energy in materials, transportation / infrastructure costs, agricultural
energy use, appliances, lighting, structure and furnishings, water conservation
and space heating and cooling. Specific technologies are now in the marketplace
which can exceed even this goal, and which make possible widespread and

  <DD>It is far cheaper to avoid the need for services than to supply them,
however efficiently. Our &quot;Make Where You ARE Paradise&quot; proposals
outlined ways to reduce need for transportation and avoid associated costs.
Transit-supportive urban land-use patterns are beginning to implement some
of these potentials. High-speed hydro-electric rail systems are the key
to integrated transportation systems for Oregon and elsewhere. Analysis
of the multi-modal system now planned by the state Transportation Commission
shows rail giving a potential for 33% savings ($8 billion) in initial construction
costs. Once infrastructure is in place, passenger-mile costs for additional
rail capacity drop to 1/20th that of highway travel. The crucial element
is connectiveness between modes which can reduce the need for car ownership.
100 mpg cars tested by all major manufacturers can reduce highway fuel usage
by 75% within 10 years.

urban food production, and bed &amp; breakfasts - can change the life of
our communities. They minimize need for resources, transportation and consumption
of land, while bringing our lives into closer contact with others and our

Chinese &quot;feng-shui&quot; practice involved aligning their homes, cities,

understanding of feng-shui which resulted from our discovery of the geophysical
basis underlying this process has found application in designing our built
environment and in improving safety from videoscreens and other sources

  <DT><B>BUILD FOR ETERNITY</B>
  <DD>Planning for 1000-year lives of our buildings and communities ensures
we see and respond to our depletion of global resources. Energy and resource
efficient and healthy buildings have extreme importance.
  <DD><BR>
  <DD>The technical and economic success of energy and resource efficient
buildings is now well shown. It is no longer pioneering territory as it
was twenty years ago when this research and demonstration house was designed
and built by a class of 150 pre-architecture students. Technical systems
gain value when integrated into an interactive design - where waste energy
from one system cycles to support another, or where superinsulation reduces
the need for solar heating to the level easily supplied.
  <DD><BR>
  <DD>Ouroboros' pioneering design for energy efficiency in northern prairie
climates demonstrated this, including: earth sheltering and sod roofs; superinsulation
and insulative windows; night insulating shutters; combined direct and active
solar heating using snow reflection; water conservation and compost toilets;
attached food-producing greenhouses; wind electricity; naturally induced
summer air cooling; low-energy materials; material, energy, and nutrient
recycling; and natural habitat and microclimate improvement.
  <DD><BR>
  <DD>Today's need is to ensure that ALL buildings are energy and resource
efficient and healthy Energy codes such as adopted by states under the Northwest
Power Plan are one of several mechanisms for addressing new construction,
as are the &quot;Nega-Watt&quot; purchase plans of several utilities to
deal with existing buildings.

  <DT><B>TOUCH THE HEART OF ALL YOU MAKE</B>
  <DD>Sustainable building patterns are not effective without sustainable
institutional patterns. Such patterns often transfer the initiative from
the institution to the individual, and employ more effective and empowering
interactive patterns.
  <DD><BR>
  <DD>You know a school works when the kids don't want to go home. This
family-based alternative elementary school has a curriculum based on need
for student self-confidence before learning can take place, and on learning
following student enthusiasm. Consensus-based decision making often releases
and resolves deeper issues in the community .
  <DD><BR>
  <DD>The school was built by families in a &quot;barn-raising&quot;. The
design has classrooms located around a &quot;Commons&quot; for individual
projects, parent participation, and meeting space. Toxicity review was made
of all products used. The design uses full daylighting, energy and water
conservation, local materials, and provides both indoor and outdoor class
space.

<BR>
<P ALIGN=RIGHT><I>1986 FIRE MOUNTAIN SCHOOL<BR>

<DL>
  <DD>Asking what the users of a building need can often help find more
effective institutional patterns. In a Head Start Center we asked what would
make us feel best as a kid coming in the door. &quot;The smell of good food!&quot;
was the immediate answer. We made the kitchen the physical and organizational
heart of the Center. With the kitchen openable into every room, the cook
represented a friend and bite of food for every kid, a cup of coffee and
a sympathetic ear for every harried parent, and an extra eye for everyone's
safety.
  <DD><BR>
  <DD>The lobby expanded into a comfortable Commons - a place for community
volunteers and staff to work, a place for parents to find a moment of peace
and rest in an often tumultuous day. In the kids' own space, a play structure
was designed to bring them close to the ground and sprouting spring bulbs
outside the window, to a skylight to watch clouds and rain running off the
roof, and to unexpected mirrors to give them new views of themselves.

  <DD>Increased housing density and other techniques can reduce the construction
cost of housing, but other costs are far more significant over the lifetime
of a house. Financing is by far the largest cost, followed by operating
energy. This top award winner in the 1981 California Affordable Housing
Competition outlined ways to reduce overall housing costs by a whopping
75-90%.<BR>
<BR>
  <DD>Increased durability was shown to be the outstanding contributor to
reducing net construction costs. A no-interest revolving loan fund addressed
financing costs, and a community housing exchange addressed sales costs.
Energy costs were lowered by now-common means.<BR>
<BR>
  <DD>Buildings can be constructed to serve well for many generations, and
doing so can dramatically reduce their cost.

  <DT><B>DESIGN FOR CONTEXT, WILD CARDS, AND CHANGE</B>
  <DD>Communities need change and creative tension, and the impact of unplanned
and unexpected juxtapositions. They need to touch the spirit of their members
and the universe they inhabit. Communities also need the rightness of basic
patterns to keep connected things together and harmful ones apart, to implement
effective transportation and supporting land use patterns. To the degree
we reclaim our cities and family budgets from the automobile, we can gain
the benefits of minimized demands on support systems.<BR>
<BR>
  <DD>Models for the technical solutions to these issues exist. The regulatory
changes and creative impulses are our opportunity today.

  <DT><B>CREATE BUILDINGS WITH SOULS</B>
  <DD>Buildings designed for sustainability need have more than good technical
systems. They need to have both that AND be designed for durability, for
livability, for community, and to touch our hearts. They need to support
sustainable emotional, spiritual, value-centered, and institutional patterns.
  <DD><BR>
  <DD>This home included a focus on sustainable local materials; a high-efficiency
woodstove made of recycled auto engine blocks; recycled lumber, furniture,
sinks, glass, appliances, and solar collector panels made of recycled printing
plates. Heating is by passive solar, solar hot water, and site-grown wood
heat. A non-mechanical &quot;cool box&quot; was used for food preservation,
and foot valves on sinks for energy and water conservation and hygiene.
Other elements included high-efficiency lighting, owner-built and state-approved
compost toilet, insulating window shutters, native plant landscaping, tree
planting to repay material cost, and low-toxicity materials for indoor air
quality.
  <DD><BR>
  <DD>Institutional changes included home office, home schooling, and owner-building.
Rooms are planned to let activities follow the path of the sun through the
day, to celebrate sun and moon-rise and -set, to have entire rooms open
fully to the outside in good weather. Mechanized sounds were eliminated
in the design. Other elements support elimination of unnecessary material
goods and closer connection with the natural world. The quietude and freedom
these technical changes gave permitted a spirit in the building that supported
its inhabitants and connected to its surroundings.

  <DD>Designing a building with a soul requires focused attention to each
decision in design and construction, so that each element answers its need

<DL>
  <DT><B>BUILD ON SUSTAINABLE VALUES </B>
  <DD>The values necessary for sustainability invoke a better, and very
different, way of life. PERMANENCE instead of profit; PEOPLE instead of
professions, RESPONSIBILITIES instead of rights; ENOUGHNESS instead of moreness;
BETTERMENT instead of biggerment; LOCALIZATION instead of centralization;
WORK instead of leisure; EQUITIZATION instead of urbanization; TOOLS instead
of machines.
  <DD><BR>
  <DD>AUSTERITY instead of affluence, for example, does not exclude all
richness or enjoyments in our buildings or our lives. It only asks us to
avoid those distracting from or destructive of personal relatedness. Affluence,
in contrast, does not discriminate between what is wise and useful, and
what is merely possible. Affluence demands impossible endless growth, both
because those things necessary for good relations are foregone for unnecessary
things, and because many of those unnecessary things act to damage or destroy
the good relations that we desire.

  <DD>The uniqueness of a region creates a unique culture and built environment
once we come to feel at home in it. Learning to value and celebrate that
specialness is necessary both to a region's sustainability and to our own
comfort and enjoyment. The pioneering Winter Cities project, created by
Canadian Arni Fullerton, pulled people together from similar environments
worldwide to develop common markets for winter cars and clothes, and winter
problem solving. More importantly, they discovered how to celebrate, enjoy,
and live happily in winter instead of merely counting the days until summer.

  <DD>The words &quot;Pacific Northwest&quot; mean RAIN. People groan about
it. They try to forget it and escape it. What would happen if they enjoyed
it? Slug races, mud-wallowing games, buildings that celebrate the rain running
off roofs? An intensive &quot;Zen Rain Garden&quot; proposed for the heart
of the city of Portland, Oregon, would act to celebrate and keep us in touch
with the rich and powerful forces that give the Northwest its special character.

This proposal, for a museum and shrine to the immense geophysical forces

  <DD>Visiting other people and places should enrich both them and ourselves
through exposure to different values, conditions, and achievements. An Oregon
coastal community decided that this &quot;spirit of place&quot; is a fundamental
element of successful tourism . They concluded that people come to the Coast
for its specialness, which should not be lost among look-alike tourist facilities.
The community hall and visitor's center used an $80,000 grant for architectural
crafts to help their building more powerfully convey to both community and
visitors the unique character of the Oregon Coast.

  <DD>A true sense of our place in the universe must underlie any sustainable
community. Modern research has produced a picture of the universe we inhabit
which is more awe-inspiring than any traditional myth. Knowing the deeper
themes of evolution brings new light on our nature, our relationship to
the elements and to eternity. This deeper sense of ourselves and of a closer

  <DD>Love is expressed in our surroundings, as elsewhere, in our willingness
to give without condition. The most precious thing a building can convey
is that sense of unstinted giving - of doing something out of love rather
than calculation. Giving initiates a reciprocity that grows in value to
both the giver and receiver. Surroundings which are given more than the
minimum convey a sense of generosity which is true freedom. That in turn
evokes a sense of love and giving in others.<BR>

  <DT><B>AFFIRM SACREDNESS IN OUR BUILDING</B>
  <DD>Many intractable social problems - alcoholism, drug abuse, crime,
child and spouse abuse, homelessness, obesity, poverty, failing schools
- have a common root. They all arise out of lack of self-worth, lack of
respect by and for others, or lack of opportunity to be of use and value
to family and society. They are all diseases of the spirit.
  <DD><BR>
  <DD>Our built environment embodies our attitudes. Change our surroundings
to reaffirm the sacredness of our world and we can restore a sense of respect,
honor, and value. This is a necessary part of the solving these social problems,
and necessary for sustainability. Symbolism, geometry, the process of building,
geomancy, community design, the economics of building from a spiritual base,
and learning from existing sacred places all contribute to a new design
perspective.
  <DD><BR>
  <DD>Build schools that treat students as adults and as people. Build places
for health care that cherish the sick. Build work places that treat the
workers as being as valuable as the machines and the boss. Give builders
a chance to put something into the building they can show their children
with pride. Respect the patina of age in buildings and people.

GREEN DOES NOT A CITY MAKE<BR>
</B></I>Planting trees does not insure nature is part of our cities. Getting

have beautiful and stimulating public spaces built entirely of stone - no
less a part of nature than trees. Sustainability requires opening our hearts
to finding patterns of local fitness and new potential.<BR>

SILENCE HAS POWER<BR>
</B></I>It is as vital a dimension in our surroundings as space. Eliminating
the sounds of TV, refrigerators, HVAC systems, dishwashers and office equipment

Recently I had an opportunity to visit a number of the gardens and precincts
of Daitokuji Zen Temple in Kyoto. It had been 17 years since I had last
visited them, and 25 years have passed since my first wonderful exposure
to them.<BR>
<BR>
It was amazing the transformation in spirit which intensive tourism had
brought within the temple precincts. Walls which gave shelter to the gardens
had been ripped out to give tourists faster access. Loudspeakers under the
verandas gave an intrusive speech to each tour group. Visitors were being
strongly pressured to buy a tea ceremony. Monks were selling autographs
and joking boisterously with the visitors. Ash trays were lined up along
the verandas inviting people to smoke - in spite of &quot;no smoking&quot;
signs, and cigarette smoke filled the air. Lounges to accommodate chattering
tourists had been installed next to &quot;National Treasure&quot; gardens
. Gift shops cluttered the precincts. Tour groups were rushed through in
huge numbers. <BR>
<BR>
Many of the planted gardens were literally dying from generations of Zen
perfection in their cleaning and maintenance. For generations, even the
most minute speck of &quot;dying&quot; organic matter had been raked, swept,
and taken away instead of being allowed to compost and turn into new soil.
Topsoil literally doesn't exist any more in many gardens (great for moss
perhaps, but not for trees or a healthy natural community).<BR>
<BR>
These problems are not unique to Daitokuji. Similar situations exist at
many other temples and shrines. I watched more than 350 students pouring
in and out of the famous Ryoanji Temple's rock garden in less than 15 minutes.
That temple recently destroyed their most beautiful garden - the moss garden
around the corner from the &quot;famous&quot; rock garden - to build an
unneeded bridge to a new temple building next door I saw elaborate drainage
systems being installed around the roots of trees in many gardens to try
to save them. The problem was not drainage, but that we had allowed all
the life of its soil be removed.<BR>
<BR>
In all fairness, I also discovered one small garden at the Ryogen-in whose
raking pattern had been subtly changed, making the garden much more powerful,
and the only place of living energy I felt in the parts of the precincts
I visited. That living tradition is essential, but seems rare today.<BR>
<BR>
I was saddened by this for several reasons. Several of the gardens and their
precincts are, or should be, National Treasures. Their damage, the risk
of their destruction by fire, and the deterioration of people's experience
of them does not speak well of the stewardship we give to the precious heritage
we have been given. The impression that visitors receive is that the only
god worshiped in temple precincts today is the god of money and tourist
dollars. There is no sense of a living spiritual tradition. Being able to
take ourselves lightly is good, but what I felt was something quite different.<BR>
<BR>
Quite a few years ago, I found a similar situation with the cathedrals of
Europe,. I discovered then that there is a vital difference between tourism
and pilgrimage, and the cumulative impacts they impart to both the people
and the places involved.<BR>
<BR>
Sitting in the gardens at Daitokuji, and wondering about their fate, I realized
that there are ways that we <I>can</I> respond to tourism from a spiritual
base. We <I>can</I> require that where it impacts our own lives, our actions,
and the places for which we have responsibility, it be transformed into
something conforming with and transmitting spiritual values. If we fail
to do that, we fail to acknowledge the rightness of what our own experience
shows us. If we fail to support our beliefs in our own lives, those beliefs
become hollow and dead - something to be &quot;believed in&quot; rather
than to be <I>&quot;KNOWN!!!&quot;</I>.<BR>
<BR>
What can we do? In this particular case, I started by writing a letter to
the Temple, sharing my concerns and the possibilities I saw for changing
that particular situation. I'm sure the list can be expanded and improved
upon, but here are things that came to my mind as I left Kyoto:<I><BR>
<BR>
* Smoking should be prohibited in temple compounds, and that prohibition
enforced.</I><BR>
There are proven health hazards in smoking for smokers and non-smokers alike.
When we add in its potential fire hazard, and its impact in diverting and
diffusing a person's attention, there is no reason it should be allowed
in this situation.<I><BR>
<BR>
* Silence should be required of both visitors and temple personnel in the
gardens and adjacent areas.</I><BR>
It is extremely difficult to experience the gardens amidst the chit-chat
of visitors and the spiels of tour guides. The restraint of silence focuses
us into a different mindset, much as the long entrance walkway to the Saihoji
garden gives visitors an opportunity to leave the outside world behind and
prepare for their experience of the garden.<I><BR>
<BR>
* No commercial group visits should be permitted. Individual visitors should
be permitted only with a reservation, and in limited numbers.</I><BR>
I have rarely found people on a group tour really connecting with the places
they visited. Time is usually limited, there is too much interaction between
the people on the tour, and many of them are not really interested in the
places they are visiting. There are reasons for exceptions, but they should
be carefully worked out.<I><BR>
<BR>
* Visitors should be admitted for a minimum visit of an hour and a half.
(Hold their shoes hostage!)</I><BR>
It takes time to soak up the spirit of a place. A person trying to cram
ten tourist spots into a day never focuses on any of them. An hour and a
half at one garden is a far more precious experience than ten minutes a
piece at several gardens. If a person can't figure out how to do nothing
for an hour and a half, they're not ready to visit a garden.<I><BR>
<BR>
* Offer visitors tea and steaming towels - make them <U>guests</U>.</I><BR>
When we give and welcome with a different attitude, people respond in kind,
and a different relationship develops.<I><BR>
<BR>
* Offer tea ceremonies, zazen, or what ever talks or introductions you wish,
- but don't charge for them. </I><BR>
A 90 minute visit can include several things - the basic issue is the willingness
to commit a significant amount of time to one thing, one place. Use the
opportunity to connect with people, learn from them, share what we have
to offer, instead of picking their pockets. Selling salvation doesn't fly.<I><BR>
<BR>
* Let people know fully what their entrance fees are being used for.</I><BR>
The image one gets after standing for an hour by the ticket booth for a
temple or garden is of temple staff inside at their computers playing the
stock market with the revenues from entrance fees. People feel different
about fees if they know how much goes to maintenance, training, good works,
or sake parties. Open finances open minds.<BR>
<BR>
As I traveled in Japan on that visit, the issue of how we relate to places
we visit was constantly on my mind. On part of the visit I was traveling
with a Lummi indian friend, who had brought his flute and spirit drum. He
would stop, at each waterfall, temple, or shrine, and offer a prayer in
song or music. It was his offering, and felt right. For me to do the same
would not have felt right - it would have been giving his offering, not
my own.<BR>
<BR>
A Japanese friend explained one interesting aspect of money offerings made
at temples. The name of the 5-yen coin is &quot;go-en&quot;, which has a
double meaning of &quot;connection&quot; as well as a monetary unit. &quot;Go-en&quot;
were given to the temples - more as a sign of offering and relationship
than as a monetary contribution. <BR>
<BR>
As I traveled, I did find many ways to turn my visits to places into something
other than tourism. Offering prayers, leaving offerings - of a go-en and
a couple of red maple leaves, if nothing else; sitting darshan, giving a
bit of time in upkeep of neglected places - each left the place, myself,
and other visitors changed. <BR>
<BR>
At the Ryogen-in, my son and I sat for over an hour at the wonderful but
forgotten interior garden, relishing its beauty and energy and honoring
its gift. People came by, looked at us, looked at what we were looking at.
Their eyes widened, and they sat down, one by one. By the time we left,
more than a dozen people had stopped and joined us in a special experience,
at a place they would otherwise have overlooked. At another neglected but
lovely place that we returned to several times, we saw our lonely maple
leaves and go-en joined by more and more offerings. It felt like we were
replanting seeds - in both people and places, which left all of us a bit
transformed in their wake. <BR>
<BR>
There are many ways, beyond our individual actions as visitors that can
transform tourism and how we enhance or destroy the sacredness of places.
We start, of course, with becoming more conscious of our attitudes and practices
as travellers and visitors. We can change the management and control of
visitor practices at sacred places. We can find ways to control view impacts,
electromagnetic fields, and other disturbances which affect sacred places.
We can find ways to express the special spirit of a place in facilities
for visitors instead of building generic hotels, restaurants, and visitor
facilities. That special spirit of places, such as winter cities, rain forests,
etc. can be enhanced and expressed in activities, how we build, and what
we restrain from doing. We can restore the spiritual core of our individual
and institutional actions. And we can modify attitudes and practices concerning
tourism, and eliminating many of its externalized costs.<BR>
<BR>
Walking through a town and hearing the sounds of bells and drums ringing
from the visits of pilgrims instead of the sounds of tour busses and cash
registers, speaks to everyone that the spirit is rising,. It says to all
that we and our world are sacred, and that we live and love the fullness
that is life. It is the actions of each of us that create the path that
our future will follow. As I went along, and as I ended that trip, I gave
my prayers for a healing of the the wounds in our spirits and our places
from a world that is forgetting what sustains life. And I saw those prayers
themselves begin to form their own answer.<BR>

<BR>
The greatest failing of our cities today is the same as that of the society
in which they are embedded - <I>a failure to address the spiritual dimension
of our lives</I>. This is not the once-a-week, sit-in-church spiritual dimension
of our lives, but the everyday part that deals with the diseases of the
spirit which constitute our greatest social problems. <BR>
<BR>
Look at all our intractable social problems - violence, alcoholism, tobacco
and drug use, crime, child and spouse abuse, homelessness, obesity, apathy,
broken homes, poverty, failing schools. All are reaching epidemic proportions.
All seem resistant to resolving.<BR>
<BR>
These are not separate problems, however. They have a common root. They
are not diseases of the body, but of our psychic &quot;immune system&quot;.
They all arise out of lack of self-worth, lack of respect by and for others,
or lack of opportunity to be of use and value to family and society. These
problems are all <I>diseases of the spirit.</I>
<UL>
  <LI><I>It is a disease of the spirit </I>we see in the eyes of people
who have been defeated - individually or as a society - and seen what they
love and value destroyed, lost, or taken away.<I><BR>
<BR>
</I>
  <LI><I>It is a disease of the spirit </I>when wealth and comfort make
us too self-satisfied to reach out for the vital nourishment and understanding
arising from work, community, and giving to others.<I> <BR>
<BR>
</I>
  <LI><I>It is a disease of the spirit </I>when the weight of the successes
and failures of the past lie so heavily on a person or culture that they
don't want to even try to measure up either to the past, or to their own
potentials.<I> <BR>
<BR>
</I>
  <LI><I>It is a disease of the spirit </I>where we lack the nurture of
meaningful and honored goals, roles, responsibilities and power.
</UL>
<BR>
These same diseases underlie our external environmental problems. A focus
only on technological solutions to the <I>outer</I> symptoms of diseases
of the spirit is, however, deeply troublesome. With it we ignore the emotional,
psychological social, cultural, and spiritual poisoning that results from
a profusion of material wealth. It is that wealth which has allowed us the
latitude to focus only on our individual material &quot;wants&quot; and
not on our inner needs for health and community. We ignore, as well, the
root causes of our external environmental problems, ensuring that their
&quot;solution&quot; will only cause their reappearance in another guise.<BR>
<BR>
People speak with fear in their hearts of the growing violence of modern
cities, but view it as an isolated situation which can be contained by equally
violent response and punishment. Yet violence is a fundamental tenant of
modern culture and the appropriate fruit of our society. What else can we
expect when we create immense wealth alongside desperate poverty, and provide
the means and training for violent action? What else can we expect when
the fundamental economic and legal principles of our society are based on
violent exploitation of resources, people, and other life? What can we expect
when our agriculture and medicine are based on annihilation of all we don't
want or understand? What can we expect when we have exercised the power
of exterminating or destroying entire cultures? <BR>
<BR>
We cannot ignore the values and beliefs which underlie our actions. We cannot
address urban violence until we acknowledge and respond to the hidden violence
of rape, incest, abuse, harassment, suppression, war, poverty and environmental
destruction. We cannot expect to resolve random violence unless we are willing
to give up the fruits of our deeper violence.<BR>
<BR>
Thomas Berry refers to our modern consumer society as the supreme pathology
of all history, a pathology in which we have virtually defined consumption
as the highest human purpose. (<I>THE DREAM OF THE EARTH, Thomas Berry,
1988.</I>) Is it right to focus only on how to make that kind of society
operate a bit better, or is it wiser to ask what our special role and purpose
is in life's evolutionary path and how best to fulfill that role? We will
be willing to transform our values, and thus our actions, only when we realize
that our present ones are unnecessary, harmful, and replaceable by more
effective alternatives.<I><BR>
<BR>
Sustainability requires a true transformation of our basic values, the development
of a spiritual core to our lives and society, and a building of institutions
that direct our actions in harmony with these values.</I> Sources of our
problems, not just their symptoms, need to be addressed. <BR>
<BR>
Material wealth is truly not an issue to our individual or global well-being.
<I>Equity</I> and fairness of comparative wealth and power <I>are</I>. The
sustainable capability of natural resources and systems, our numbers, and
the wisdom with which we live and use those resources to support our lives,
growth, and culture set the limits of what is possible. Healthy, rewarding
lives have been lived for thousands of years within very restrictive material
limitations, while very unrewarding lives are increasingly common today
under conditions of plentiful material resources. Within the boundaries
of the possible, we need to determine not just what is obvious, but what
is <I>wise</I>. <BR>
<BR>
We have shown in energy, housing, transportation, food production, water
and waste, health, and education that the resource demands necessary to
support the way of life of countries such as the U.S. can easily be cut
by 90% or more. This means that if such ways of life are truly desirable,
they can be achieved well within the levels of material sustainability,
in the process improving their effectiveness. It means our past practices
and values are unnecessary and counterproductive. And we are showing today
that other approaches are greatly more effective.<BR>
<BR>
All economics, and all cultures and communities derive from distinctive
assertions of value. If the values chosen reflect consumption, greed, and
violence, they will create a far different world than of those values chosen
are spiritual values. E.F. Schumacher, in his path-breaking <I>&quot;Buddhist
Economics&quot; </I>powerfully remarked on the characteristic kind of economics
which arises from the values of Buddhism - on the role and importance of
enriching work, of obtaining the maximum well-being from minimum consumption,
and of the importance of non-attachment to wealth. (<I>&quot;Buddhist Economics&quot;</I>,
E.F. Schumacher. Available in SMALL IS BEAUTIFUL, E.F. Schumacher; ENVIRONMENTAL
DESIGN PRIMER, Bender, 1973; or STEPPING STONES, deMoll and Coe, 1978.)
He has shown also its effectiveness in creating successful life, culture,
and tools.<BR>
<BR>
Reestablishing a value base to our communities involves discovery of the
real meaning of a whole range of sustainable values. (See <I>&quot;New Values&quot;</I>
in SHARING SMALLER PIES, Bender, 1975. Reprinted in RAIN, April 1975; NEW
AGE JOURNAL, Nov. 1975; THE FUTURIST, 1976; RESETTLING AMERICA, Gary Coates,
1981; UTNE READER, Fall 1987.) <I>Austerity</I>, for example, is important.
But it does not, as we may think, exclude richness or enjoyment. What it
does do is help us avoid things which keep us from our real goals in life.
When we understand austerity, we see that affluence has a great hidden cost.
Its possibilities demand impossible commitments of time and energy. It fails
to discriminate between what is wise and useful and what is merely possible.
We end up foregoing things necessary for a truly satisfying life to make
time and space for trivia. When we relearn to the value of austerity, along
with stewardship, permanence, responsibility, enoughness, work, and interdependence,
we will begin to create a new kind of community.<BR>
<BR>
Like a garden, our lives need to be weeded if they are to produce a good
crop. Spiritual values are excellent cultivating tools. With them we become
clearly aware how our conventional world splits us through the heart. We
divide our time and lives between work and leisure. But rarely do we allow
our work the leisure to be enriching. And rarely do we allow our leisure
the purpose and reward of doing things of value and benefit. In a world
of such contradictory values, wholeness is not possible.<BR>
<BR>
Spiritual values restore us to the wholeness needed to reconnect with our
own hearts, our neighbors and the world around us. They give us the strength
to summon our vital inner resources and to guide the powerful tools of our
technology into right paths. They teach us the importance of community-based
economics, and of not excluding from our decisions the costs today often
passed on to others. (See PARADIGMS IN PROGRESS, Hazel Henderson, 1991,
for overview of full-costing mechanisms.) They help us understand the importance
of &quot;fair trade&quot;, rather than &quot;free trade&quot; whose conditions
have been laid down from a major imbalance of power.<BR>
<BR>
They also give us the basis for transforming and creating institutions which
work to support rather than deplete the lasting supply of world resources,
biosystem health, and the capabilities of human and global systems that
constitute our real wealth. Paul Hawken's proposal for a &quot;salmon utility&quot;,
for example, would collect fees from all salmon landings and use them for
habitat restoration, education, and land acquisition, ensuring high sustainable
productivity of the fishing resource. A similar oil utility, he proposes,
would find it more profitable to invest in auto efficiency than in disruption
of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. (THE ECOLOGY OF COMMERCE, Paul Hawken,
1993.)<BR>
<BR>
Equivalent institutional changes are already happening in water and sewage
treatment, and have been proposed for higher education, transportation,
and other fields. (See, for example, Rocky Mountain Institute and Center
for Living Waters publications, and <I><A HREF="Vitality.htm">&quot;Vitality
and Affordability of Higher Education&quot;</A></I>, Bender, 1993.) It is
clear that the maze of regulatory agencies and lawsuits that has resulted
from attempts to patch together business endeavors and preservation of natural
systems health is an ineffective process. Reorganization of institutional
goals from a spiritual basis so they avoid the <I>need</I> for such regulatory
control is a far more effective process for all. Proper evolution of our
cities and communities can make it possible for them to <I>contribute</I>
<I>to</I> rather than deplete, the sustainability of our human culture.<BR>
<P><CENTER>* * *</CENTER>
<P>A spiritual core to society is essential for personal and social health
and survival. Simply put, that spiritual core deals with &quot;honoring&quot;.
It deals with respect, with what the Christian Golden Rule distilled into,
<I>&quot;Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.&quot; </I><BR>
<BR>
How <I>do</I> we honor each other, and ourselves? How do we honor old people,
children, the sick or dying? How do we honor workers and those outside the
workplace? How do we honor those going through life's changes? (<I>&quot;Time
and Place&quot;</I>, THE HEART OF PLACE, Bender, 1993.) How do we honor
our neighbors, our past, our communities, or our adversaries? How do we
honor plants and animals; the earth, air and waters; our planet and the
stars from which we are descended? What does this mean for design of our
buildings and communities? (<I>&quot;Building with a Heart&quot;</I>, THE
HEART OF PLACE, Bender, 1993.)<BR>
<BR>
Expressing a sense of honoring in our surroundings is but a small piece
of a sacred world, but one which permeates and connects to everything. And
it is one which constantly surrounds us with concrete images of what we
value. A sense of mutual respect would stop the use of prices, product sizes,
and advertising intended to confuse purchasers. A sense of the spiritual
core to our world would create specific places and an overall sense in our
communities that there are things which must be allowed to be enduring,
immutable, and inviolate. A sense of the true needs connecting the parts
of our lives and communities would eliminate the single-use zoning isolation
of different aspects of our society which generates need for unnecessary
transportation. A realization that material greed should not be the primary
driving force of a society would eliminate the use of public space for advertising.<BR>
<BR>
In almost every country the formal practice of spiritual traditions have
been losing power. At the same time, however, the key tenets of several
spiritual traditions concerning our relation to each other, our homes and
communities are being scientifically verified and reinterpreted for contemporary
conditions. Individuals have also been actively reforging spiritual understanding
upon which life today can be rooted. <BR>
<BR>
Many traditions, for example, have spoken in similar terms about the energy
in a place -<I> feng-shui, ley lines, earth energy</I>. We know now that
there is a demonstrable geophysical basis for part of this power of place.
And it is being clearly shown that these geophysical phenomena affect all
life and bodily processes, including the thought processes in our minds
via the magnetite found throughout our brains. (ENVIRONMENTAL DESIGN PRIMER,
Bender, 1973; and THE HEART OF PLACE, above.)<BR>
<BR>
Such energy connections may appear esoteric at first contact. Yet the spiritual
traditions of many cultures have long spoken of a particular kind of human
life energy. The Chinese call it <I>chi</I>, the Japanese, <I>ki</I>. Hippocrates
called it the <I>Vis Medicatrix Naturae</I>. The Egyptians called it <I>Ka</I>;
the Hindus, <I>Prana</I>, the Hawaiians, <I>Mana</I>. Its measurement and
how it operates in our bodies is only now slowly being worked out.<BR>
<BR>
Feng-shui masters such as Professor Thomas Yun Lin have long asserted that
there are important and <I>reciprocal</I> energy interactions between us
and our surroundings which affect our lives. &quot;Our vital energy, or
<I>chi</I>&quot;, he says, &quot;impacts and alters the energy of the places
we inhabit, and consequently affects others that use those places.&quot;
We know on a less specific level that places retain the reverberations and
mark of events occurring in them long after the event. Yun Lin outlines
specific practices to impart positive energy into a place and counterbalance
the residue of past occupants.<BR>
<BR>
It is only recently that we've realized that this interaction <I>does</I>
work - <I>both</I> ways. Our <I>internal</I> &quot;chi&quot; energy impacts
and alters the energy of the places we inhabit, in much the same way that
the energy of place affects us. <BR>
<BR>
Health practitioners using a variety of techniques including dowsing, acupuncture,
computerized electrophysiology and kinesiometry are now measuring specific
physiological responses in our bodies to ELF radiation (extremely low frequency
oscillating magnetic fields) and a wide variety of other environmental stressors.
(<I>&quot;Assessing the Significance of the Geo-Arts&quot;</I>, Henry Dorst,
I.C.E.R. Journal, Fall-Winter 1992.) They are documenting consistent and
persisting physiological impacts from events as small as an overflight by
an airplane, the presence of plastic bags, auto exhaust, or low-level chemical
outgassing from plastic windows, furnishings, floor and wall coverings.
They are showing bodily responses to residuals of anger or fear from recent
occupants of a space. They are showing demonstrable loss of muscle strength
and permanent bodily damage caused by magnetic fields from computer monitors,
electric blankets, cellular phones, microwaves and other electrical appliances.
<BR>
<BR>
These studies are showing we are far less tolerant to the wide range of
harmful chemicals, products, and other influences we have released into
our surroundings than we had any idea. The emerging understanding of massive
organic damage to our bodies from organochlorine compounds is only one of
many that will necessitate major changes in our attitudes and practices.
(THE ECOLOGY OF COMMERCE, Hawken.) Most importantly, they are showing that
our bodies are far more sensitive, and far more affected by apparently subtle
aspects of our surroundings, and that the vehicle for our &quot;immunity&quot;
to many stressors is intimately related to energy fields in our bodies.<BR>
<BR>
We are clearly not distinct and separated from the world within which we
move. Influence and awareness move both ways across our skins and entwine
us into a single organism. The harm we cause to our surroundings returns
to cripple and diminish our own lives. In the world we are now seeing, there
is no excuse for <I>taking</I> from our neighbors and surroundings. There
is only reason upon reason for <I>giving</I> and enriching life on both
sides of our skin. The implications for how we shape and use our surroundings
and our lives are immense.<BR>
<BR>
When we as designers or clients stop saying only what &quot;I want...&quot;
in a project and start asking, &quot;What can this <I>give</I>?&quot;, we
begin to find exciting new opportunities to strengthen the web of community
in our cities. Planting street trees gives pedestrian shelter and lessens
summer heat for the whole community. Building placement can create useful
outside public spaces,. An inexpensive public walkway or bridge may create
pedestrian connections between parts of a city. Proper juxtaposition of
uses can encourage community and 24-hour life in our cities.<I><BR>
<BR>
Our surroundings themselves are worthy of honoring. They also act like mirrors,
expressing our values and conveying to others our inner strengths and fears,
pride and hungers. </I>They speak of our relation with nature. They reflect
our patterns of work and what we do or don't gain from that work. They show
our relations with others, and what paths we take to self-respect, balance,
and growth. They reflect our goals as a society. They tell how we build,
live and love. They show whether we know ourselves as part of the great
and all-encompassing drama and adventure of our universe, or if we see ourselves
as a small and insignificant thing apart from it all. What they reflect
back to us today is not inspiring.<BR>
<BR>
How we shape our surroundings demonstrates our values, and can be a tool
for healing ourselves and our relations to others. In a sacred society our
surroundings become a source of meaning, power and strength which we lack
today. To make our surroundings better, our hearts need to be in a better
place - which we are learning step by step. If our surroundings are better,
they make us better. Strength leads to vitality, just as weakness leads
to impotence.<BR>
<BR>
Sacred places and sacred building are vital to a healthy society. We all
know of places with such power, that should be held sacred. What sacred
places boil down to is <I>honoring</I>, And that is key to healing a whole
complex of social diseases.<BR>
<BR>
Once we accept that some places should be held sacred, it is impossible
to deny the sacredness of all places, all things, and all life. Affirming
the sacredness of all our surroundings, we have to acknowledge that we inhabit
a sacred world. As part of a sacred world, we are all to be held sacred
also. And that calls forth a totally different way of relating and acting.
If the person/place/world we love is not happy, we cannot be happy. We reject
taking for greed rather than for need. We rediscover the multiple benefits
of giving and sharing. This implements fundamental change in our ways of
working, playing, celebrating, sharing, and shaping our surroundings. (<I><A HREF="Tourism.htm">&quot;Transforming
Tourism&quot;</A></I>) We find a new strength and vitality arising in all
parts of our lives.<BR>
<P><CENTER>* * *</CENTER>
<P><I>The first step to both sound community and sound design is to reaffirm
the sacredness of our world and establish that value as a touchstone of
our society. </I><BR>
<BR>
Life in a sacred society is essential to our survival, but difficult for
many to comprehend, for we now have few remaining comparisons to the kind
of support, strength, freedom, meaning, and confidence - and therefor health
- that arise from being part of a community of respect. One dimension of
it can be seen in a Quaker or Japanese society, where consensus and shared
decision-making, shared responsibility, and respect for others is still
a central strength. Other dimensions can be seen in indigenous communities
throughout the world which still maintain fragments of ancient ties to land,
spirit, and wholeness, and in the surroundings and patterns of life which
were shaped by such traditions.<BR>
<BR>
Be that aside, there is opportunity in every act of building today to honor
and show reverence. Building from a spiritual base brings often subtle,
but powerful, changes in our ways of building. A window rather than a mirror
over a bathroom sink greets us in the morning with a view into a garden
rather than a discouraging look at our outsides in their worst condition.
It stops the diminishment of self-esteem that mirrors give. It helps wean
us from excessive attention to the surface qualities of things. Putting
a &quot;1% for heart&quot; clause in building contracts for builder contributions
that enhance the environmental, esthetic and spiritual quality of a project
can end up making <I>all</I> of the project better and enrich the workers'
skills and self-esteem. Natural materials can honor their sources. Creating
peaceful silence and shadow can give breathing room for users.<I><BR>
<BR>
Our places need to convey a spirit of greatness in our hearts, of celebration
of the universe we inhabit and of our connection with it. We need to create
homes for our spirits as well as our bodies and activities. We need to express
the special spirit of place and time in our surroundings - to celebrate
the rain, the winter, the night, the heat - and find ways to live comfortably
in harmony with them.</I><BR>
<BR>
The power of architecture has always been in the realm of its meaning, and
its ability to align and marshal the invisible inner forces of our spirits
with the invisible forces of nature. Spirit and sacredness are the root
of that power; and place, not space, its manifestation. <BR>
<BR>
Sometimes we may stumble onto one of those rare places that bring us into
powerful contact with the primal forces of our world - a remote farmhouse,
a forgotten temple garden, a simple barn, or possibly a famous cathedral.
They make our hearts overflow as does a grove of ancient redwoods or a mountain
top sunrise. We know then with certainty that the surroundings we create
<I>can</I> and<I> should </I>powerfully move our hearts. They can give deep
nourishment to our lives and provide us with concrete visions of what is
needed and possible in all our actions. We can, without question, create
places with a soul. (<I>&quot;Making Sacred Places&quot;</I>, Bender, in
THE POWER OF PLACE, James Swan, ed. 1991; and <I>&quot;Towards a Sacred
Society&quot;</I>, Bender, URBAN ECOLOGY, Spring 1993.)<I><BR>
<BR>
It is time to put heart back into our architecture.<BR>
<P><CENTER></I>* * *</CENTER>
<P>Cities, too, have personalities and reflect their makers. Present efforts
to improve the sustainability of our urban and cultural patterns have so
far ignored the vital human and spiritual components of enduring patterns.
A city can have the best conceivable design of green space, homes, neighborhoods,
efficient transportation, and material- and energy-efficient construction.
That does not make it capable of moving our hearts. It is our dreams, our
passions, our distinctive cultures and ways of life that give shape to our
cities and give them the power to move our hearts and affect our lives.
We can live without wealth, but not without love and meaning.<I><BR>
<BR>
We need places we can love, and enjoy, and about which we can be fervent.
We need to rediscover how to make the communities where we live able to
raise our passions and move our hearts.</I><BR>
<BR>
Part of the specialness of places that touch our hearts is the Spirit of
Place - those unique qualities - climate, geology, history and community
of inhabitants that make a place distinctively different from others and
which gives root to a unique personality and spirit in its inhabitants.<BR>
<BR>
Think of the &quot;Paradise Gardens&quot; of Isfahan in the desert. Remember
the incredible water and temple systems of the Khmers, harnessing river
floods to supply water for a sustainable agriculture and tying it into the
cosmology of their beliefs. Consider the Winter Cities of Canada, which
have grasped the power of imagery, meaning and emotion of winter living
and transformed their communities into wonderful celebrations of winter
with ice skating, winter festivals, skiing, snowmobiling and sled dog races.<BR>
<BR>
And think of the enduring wonder which graces a village like Amien or Mt.
St. Michael in France, where a quest for expression of the exultation of
life and creation transformed an entire community into a magical manifestation
of that power.<BR>
<BR>
The power of place can also arise from layer after layer of everyday acts
of everyday people. Many towns and villages have an evening tradition of
the &quot;passerada&quot;, where people gather in outdoor cafes and in the
squares and enjoy the spectacle of the young and old eyeing each other,
making overtures, beginning and renewing friendships. Amish villages and
farm country show an indelible mark of their nurture of life, as do Swiss
mountain villages where traditions of vibrant flower boxes in every window
have evolved, giving a special spirit to even the simplest village.<BR>
<BR>
Love of a place can even evolve invisibly out of our act of <I>belonging</I>
to it. When founding a new village, Native Americans would bury a rock during
their ceremonies of founding. The rock would not necessarily be in the middle
of the planned village, or a special rock, or prominently visible. It was
importantly, however, a mark of relationship. It said, &quot;In this place
we will live. Our lives will be centered here, and we will see the universe
and our surroundings from this point. Our lives here are a connection with
this place.&quot; And out of that commitment arose a sense of connection
with a meaningful, valued and loved place. In a related way, the great cities
of China have been built upon an image of the cosmos, the nation, nature,
and our place within it, which gives unique and potent meaning to the lives
of their inhabitants.<BR>
<BR>
Our lives are sustained in being moved by the places where we live and visit.
The power of those places evokes a similar will to self-esteem, to dreaming
great dreams, and to the will to achieve them. We can transform our communities
into something which draws forth the love of residents and visitors alike
- in the physical fabric of the city, in the celebrations it supports and
nurtures, and the way of life it empowers. <BR>
<BR>
A community which lives only for the greed of commerce and consumption does
not enjoy itself, and does not enjoy life. It has no great passions, and
dreams only small dreams. Such a community has not learned the incredible
drama of life of which we are part, and is not capable of creating sustaining
bonds within itself, with its neighbors, and with the natural world in which
it is embedded.<BR>
<BR>
It is human passions and failings, dreams and hardship, that dominate the
spirit of place of cities and give them the power to arouse our feelings
and our will to maintain, refine, and enrich them, and to ensure their life
into the future.<I><BR>
<BR>
Make our communities places to love. That is the sustaining force of life.
When we have communities we are passionate about and which nurture our souls,
we will want them to endure. With that love, we will seek and assure the
changes in infrastructure, land use, building practices and patterns of
living essential to that survival. </I><BR>

</H4>
Conventional architecture today seeks primarily visual excitement and impact,
but rarely creates places that nurture our bodies, minds, and spirits. This
study demonstrates an alternative approach to the making of place - creating
meaningful and nurturing places through design incorporating modern application
of <I>feng-shui</I> or geomancy. <BR>
<BR>
Rather than the conventional owner's demands of &quot;I want..., I want...&quot;,
it begins with the question, &quot;What is the <I>most</I> we can <I>give</I>
to users of the place, to its surroundings and community, to the future,
and to all of life?&quot; It suggests that a <I>giving-centered</I> design
process can create places which more successfully contribute to the true
goals of their creators and users than conventional and even &quot;green&quot;
design. It recognizes that embodiment of positive and nurturing values can
generate the greatest power of a place to affect us, to heal and enhance
our lives and community.<I><BR>
<BR>
Feng-shui </I>(literally 'wind and water') is the Chinese name for their
traditional approach to design of cities, homes, temples and tombs to align
our actions harmoniously with the universe. It is a multi-dimensional collection
of practices, principles, sciences and art - including what we would today
call geophysics, ecology, psychology, spiritual practice, symbolism, <I>chi
</I>(energy of life), astrology, and just good common sense. <I>Feng-shui</I>
has shown that there are demonstrable geophysical energies in the earth
which are modified by topographical features, and which influence our lives.
It has shown also that our own vital life energy - embodying our love, fear,
anger, or joy - impacts and alters the energy of the places we inhabit,
and consequently affects others that use those places.<BR>
<BR>
Traditional practice of &quot;feng-shui&quot; or geomancy often constituted
a highly competitive search to obtain and flaunt the most geomantically
favorable site or design, to give comparative advantage to one's life or
success. Such sites had the most dominant views and positions, favorable
breezes, exposures, terrain, neighbors, etc. In contrast, modern feng-shui
practice often recognizes what is soon learned in a family relationship
- that the happiness and well-being of each is dependent upon the health
and well-being of all. It seeks improvement of the qualities of physical
surroundings which can benefit an entire community, recognizing that the
position of generator of that good brings the greatest benefits of all.
<BR>
<BR>
In this case, choice of site was not possible. The study was an entry in
a competition for design of a new Museum of Korean Art and Culture to be
built in Los Angeles, CA. The site was already determined, and its context
and qualities were not encouraging. It was located in a commercial ghetto
in a smog-ridden and automobile-dominated urban area of Los Angeles, filled
with racial and class tensions and the aftermath of rioting and arson. The
site was rubble-strewn and barren, with virtually no trace of the natural
ecological community remaining. The site starkly reflected the results of
a society based on greed, on self-centeredness and materialism, on taking
rather than giving. This provided an appropriate challenge to find what
could be given to a place and its community to nurture and improve its energy
and life, and to tackle head-on the issue of healing and revitalizing the
places most damaged by our actions.<BR>
<BR>
Our energy connections with a place occur through our bodies, our minds,
and our hearts. If its neighborhood is too scary to enter, noone will visit
a museum, no matter how beautiful we make it. If our surroundings reflect
back to us only the values of greed, lack of caring, and failure, we are
unlikely to become caring, giving, successful people. But if we initiate
caring for a place, for its people, and honoring a belief in a good future,
it will come to reflect those values, too, and become a support for the
people who live within it. The most important change any building on this
site could demonstrate is a change in the values it embodies and establishment
of the precept of 'giving' rather than 'taking' as a basis for interaction.<BR>
<BR>
One basic strategy chosen was to take what is considered waste, and turn
it into wealth which can enrich the community. We chose probably the least
likely action possible - of taking the community sewer and rerouting it
onto the site. The sewage of the neighborhood would be pumped onto the roof
of the museum, given advanced biological treatment, and its nutrients used
to support rooftop produce gardens to provide fresh produce to the neighborhood.
The produce would be sold at a green grocer incorporated into the public
areas of the site, which would provide incentive and opportunity for everyone
in the neighborhood to drop in, linger, and relax, as well as obtain fresh,
healthy produce.<BR>
<BR>
The wastewater from the produce gardens would then be distributed along
the surrounding streets to irrigate street tree plantings of native California
live oaks. This would help restore greenery, shade, and some of the native
ecology back into the area, as well as decreasing temperature swings. It
would also provide groundwater aquifer recharge, while demonstrating that
a community can take action to improve itself.<BR>
<BR>
This may seem at first to be far removed from the mission of an art museum
and culture center. It is a capability for &quot;giving&quot;, however,
which is inherent in any facility in a neighborhood with community consciousness
and a large roof area. It also has a particular appropriateness in KOMA's
case. KOMA does not have a traditional museum's goal of just storing old
objects. Its goal is to honor its particular cultural heritage, transmit
its skills and values, heal tensions in the community, and stimulate a positive
new modern synthesis of culture. For that primary role of the center to
even begin to succeed, however, it has to show leadership, to become a welcome
and valued part of the community and to draw people into and contributing
to its activities. Vitality is a goal of art, and any tool which helps achieve
that vitality creates an appropriate art form. The resultant roof gardens,
street landscaping, and facility gardens are a true form of art as well
as wealth - created out of the once worthless waste of community sewage.
In this context, sewage truly is art, and the neighborhood an appropriate
canvas! <BR>
<BR>
A vision put into action, of a community enriching and empowering itself
through discovering its least likely source of wealth, can be an essential
element of survival, leadership, and of synthesizing a new and vibrant culture
in this time and place. It also provides several potential concrete benefits
- recapture and savings of sewage treatment and disposal costs, avoiding
use of chemical fertilizers, keeping nutrients and food production in the
neighborhood and in control of the residents, and providing an attraction
to bring more than just Korean neighborhood residents into the project.
It turns unused roof areas that conventionally contribute only to climate
extremes into green and productive areas. It provides areas of economic
value on the project property beyond those otherwise limited by city zoning
codes. Perhaps most importantly, it demonstrates a commitment to improving
the quality of the community, and concern for the health and well-being
of all members of the community - human and otherwise.<I><BR>
<BR>
This first level of 'chi' design changed the energy of the neighborhood</I>
- replacing values that destroy, pave over, ignore, and take, and setting
in motion ones that support and restore life, diversity, caring, and giving.<I><BR>
<BR>
Feng-shui</I> acknowledges the importance of our continuing awareness of
our dependence upon and place in the web of life - both as a matter of survival
and as a source of joy and happiness. The aptness of the natural community
of life that evolves out of long interaction in a place is a visceral demonstration
of 'fit-ness', and actions taken to initiate its restoration and our proper
fit into it some of the most important actions we can take with a place,
apart from the practical benefits of such actions.<I><BR>
<BR>
A second level of 'chi' design for KOMA changed the ecology of the site
itself.</I> It constituted actions around and within the site itself to
improve the microclimate and ecological aspects of the facility. In addition
to the rooftop produce garden, four other separate garden or green elements
were designed into the project - a powerful traditional Korean garden in
the heart of the site, a community-use &quot;forecourt&quot; garden area;
an outside neighborhood &quot;pocket garden&quot; along the sidewalk adjacent
to the west entrance to the project, and the native street tree plantings
surrounding the site. These quieted the site, freshened the air, exchanged
carbon dioxide for oxygen, provided places for birds, insects, plants, and
reestablished a natural ecological community on the site.<BR>
<BR>
Other water features were part of the design - a gurgling and splashing
&quot;moat&quot; surrounding the building, the waterfall and pond in the
pocket garden, fountains at the building corner and at the &quot;spirit
wall&quot; at the south entrance, and fountains and water features at the
entrances. They were used to increase anions in the air to counter the &quot;Santa
Anna&quot; winds, cool and refresh the air, and provide counterpoint to
the street noise. The plantings were designed to improve the oxygen/carbon-dioxide
balance in the air, and to provide food and home for birds, butterflies,
bats and other forms of life.<BR>
<BR>
The forecourt area, while people-intensive and necessarily hard-paved, was
designed with overhead tree vegetation, moss-covered undersides of overhead
structure, ivy-covered walls, and planters in guardrails and court areas.
These were all designed to be provided water and nutrients by the same wastewater
system.<BR>
<BR>
The traditional Korean garden was located in the core of the building devoted
to understanding and conveying the roots, values, and achievements of traditional
Korean culture. It was ringed by a research library, museum galleries devoted
to the traditional arts of Korea, and a performance hall for traditional
art forms. While providing a serene &quot;breakout&quot; space for meetings
and visitors to the center, the garden gave an intensive experience of traditional
Korean garden and architectural arts. As well, through the principle of
using community wastewater to nurture the garden's growth, and in the special
place given to the location of the garden in the arrangement of the facilities,
this garden also held a much more central role in the symbolic level of
affecting the <I>chi</I> of the place. <BR>
<BR>
Together, these gardens helped us to share the place with other life, to
delight in the beauty, richness, and diversity of the life that makes up
a natural community, and to rediscover the sense of fit and rightness of
the natural community that had evolved in this place over the ages.<I><BR>
<BR>
Feng-shui</I> acknowledges that healthful surroundings and a healthful culture
must be rooted in a sacred way of living. Holding something sacred is simply
keeping the well-being of that thing inviolate. That impetus comes only
from loving deeply enough that we know the well-being of all that surrounds
us is vital to our own well being. 'Honoring' - of people, place, heritage,
the future, and our selves - is the simplest and most direct expression
of a sacred way of living, and therefore of our own survival and well-being.<I><BR>
<BR>
The third, and perhaps most powerful level of 'chi' design involved the
minds and hearts of the users and visitors. </I>In doing so, it dealt with
the internal arrangement, design, and symbolic meaning of elements of the
facility. In traditional Korean city and home planning, the position of
power is the north end of the central N-S axis. Here, the ruler or owner
faced and received the power and warmth from the Sun in the South, and become
the local source of power in the complex. In this project, that pattern
of arrangement was honored, and that prime location was given to tradition,
to nature, and to ancestors, in the form of a traditional garden. <BR>
<BR>
Within the garden, in the position of greatest importance directly on this
axis, was placed a physically non-imposing, but symbolically vital element
- a shrine to the ancestors. This was to contain earth and icons brought
from sacred places in Korea. Its role was to give central place and honor
to the tradition, the land, and the ancestors which created the special
Korean tradition and culture, and which brought it to this place. It formed
a touchstone also for members of the community who had come from Korea or
whose family still live there, and a place to place the ashes of those with
deep ties to the &quot;old country&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
This is not of small importance. If a way can be found to show the <I>continuing</I>
validity and value of the principles underlying a culture and tradition
through its own design and function, the effectiveness of a museum and cultural
center dedicated to honoring, understanding, communicating and synthesizing
upon that tradition becomes an order of magnitude more successful than one
which can only preserve a discredited and dishonored tradition.<BR>
<BR>
Balanced around this shrine, representing the active and passive, yang and
yin, powers of nature, were a mountain, waterfall, a traditionally-designed
garden pavilion, and a central pool of water, representing the place and
participation of people in the balance of life. From the roof, the sun-purified
waters were conducted to the mountain and waterfall, to the still waters
of the pond, and then flow outward, carrying the energy from this central
and vital place to the rest of the project and on out into the surrounding
community. Likewise, the facility honors and spreads the heritage it represents.
At the core of the facility, the garden gives a place of silence, of emptiness
- a place for things to begin, and a reflection of the primal source out
of which all creation arises.<BR>
<BR>
On this same north-south axis are located the main activity spaces of the
center - a breakout space for the audience of the performance hall, opening
into the garden; the performance hall itself, with a unique stage arrangement
with openable walls allowing a variety of combinations of public and private
use; and the community forecourt which permits a more public, community
and people-oriented gathering space connected with the various parts of
the facility.<BR>
<BR>
The arrangement of the 'stage' area and the performance hall was planned
to give unique opportunity for flexible and public community use, and to
restore performances to the simplicity yet effectiveness of natural lighting,
open air performance, and participatory audience arrangements. The foyer
walls slide aside, merging the performance hall thrust stage and the public
performance area in the forecourt into a single large circular stage for
large community events which can play to both the hall, the forecourt, and
the balconies around it.<BR>
<BR>
Sustainability requires something be hold closely enough to our hearts that
we value it enough to devote the resources needed to its continuance. It
also requires that such maintenance be affordable. <I>Feng-shui</I> recognizes
the importance and wisdom of letting the renewable energies of nature wisely
channeled provide the heating, cooling and lighting of a building. All of
the elements of this KOMA design were planned to be naturally lighted, heated
and cooled, and except for the permanent exhibit areas, designed for open-air
use tied to the garden areas during the majority of the year, reducing conventional
energy needs an order of magnitude. They also were planned to use natural
and traditional building materials of the area. <BR>
<BR>
The design for the facility also was based on the <I>feng-shui </I>principle
of <I>durability</I>, acknowledging that a building that lasts 200 years
costs only one-tenth of a building that lasts only 20 years. The savings
from durability permit a generosity of design that gives comfort, repose,
and fullness to its elements and its users. The expression of that goal
of durability also conveys a firm belief in the future and creates a gift
of the facility to that future, acknowledging that our own lives are built
upon the gifts of the heritage we have inherited.<BR>
<BR>
This core - of permanent and temporary museum galleries, performance hall,
gardens, library, greengrocer, bookstore and newsstand - was all contained
within the traditional form of a walled enclosure - a dominant building
form not only in the Korean tradition but in many of the Latin and African
traditions which are the roots of other community residents. It was felt
a particularly appropriate form for the safekeeping of cultural treasures,
as a sanctuary from the noise, confusion, and wrongness of American urban
streets, and for security in a tension-filled community. This &quot;enclosure&quot;
was combined with curved roof forms which embodied the same sense of effortless,
floating support of traditional Korean roof construction in modern materials
and technologies.<BR>
<BR>
The &quot;moat&quot; and &quot;wall&quot; distinguishes the facility from
surrounding areas, defines it as an honored or &quot;sacred&quot; area,
and makes special acknowledgment of this difference at points of public
entry. At these points, the four elements of life - earth, air, fire, and
water are given special acknowledgment or honor. A gong or a traditional
drum is located in the central entry, acknowledging the power of air, of
vibration and sound, in the organization of life from energy. Fire, in the
form of sunlight, is honored in the form of plant life it makes possible.
Earth is honored in the placement of special rocks, whose form reminds us
of our kinship with the earth, the rocks themselves, and the stars - all
ashes of earlier stars. Water is honored everywhere at entrances, for its
central role in the creation and unfolding of life.<BR>
<BR>
Incorporation of traditional principles of design acknowledges their value,
and with that, the value of the culture of which they were part. Demonstrating
their effective power in new materials, technologies, climate, culture and
context not only gives greater meaning and effectiveness to the design itself,
but as well further enhances the credibility and value of the traditions
and our ability today to create with them a synthesis which opens new vistas
and dimensions of effectiveness for our current environmental design<BR>
<BR>
By asking the prime question, &quot;What can we <I>give</I>?&quot;, we see
what can be gained and created - free, if you wish - in the course of meeting
the program of a facility. Here both space and impetus for community place
and life were created, through careful arrangement of facilities and creation
of ancillary services that allowed community use of facilities outside the
needs of KOMA itself. We see how the impetus to neighborhood pride, fellowship,
and betterment are initiated through something as unthinkable as turning
sewage into gardens, trees, and the song of birds. We see the potency of
rediscovering the effective design principles of a tradition and finding
successful contemporary expression of them. And we see how that affects
the respect and honor we come to give that tradition, and how it affects
our own self-esteem and mutual respect. By asking the question, we are able
to create a gift of opportunity for the community - to grow, to learn, to
give, to share, and to enjoy. A community without joy is one without life.<BR>
<BR>
A building, like a person, can have a soul, can affect our lives, and can
be part of the life of a community. It can be rooted in and convey the spirit
of a strong culture and tradition. It can help restore to our surroundings
a sense of sacredness and honoring of people, place, and diverse traditions.
In its organization, construction, and demands on the rest of our world,
a building can demonstrate patterns which are sustainable and nurturing
of the human spirit and of all life. Any less is not worth pursuing.<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>FINDING ONE'S PLACE</H3>

<P><I>It is at a personal level that all grand systems have both their start
and their ultimate test, and it is with a series of personal accounts that
we will begin this issue. Since the subject is economics, you might expect
these to be either success stories or horror stories. Most of them are success
stories of a sort, but what is really going on is subtler than just that.
In each case, the behavior described violates some aspect or another of
conventional economic wisdom. I hope this will serve as a refreshing re-introduction
to the diversity of real human economic behavior.</I></P>

  <TITLE>Ann Medlock - Sept 96 letter to subscribers</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff">

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>[From Ann Medlock for the Context Institute Board]</B></P>

<P><BR>
Dear Contexter,</P>

<P>What happened to your <I>In Context</I>? Why did Context Institute stop
printing it? Is <I>Yes</I> -- the new print journal you received recently
-- <I>In Context </I>with a new name? Why haven't you heard from the Institute?
Such questions are coming in to the Institute office daily; the answers
are in this rather fat mailing. Do read on.</P>

<P>I'm a longtime<I> In Context </I>reader, a new Context Institute (CI)
Board member, and the founder of a nonprofit that honors people who stick
their necks out for the common good. Given all that, I got involved because
I think that Institute founders Robert and Diane Gilman have started on
a brave and promising new phase of their important work. I also got involved
to support them through a crisis.</P>

<P><U>Here's what I see has happened</U>:<BR>
It started when Robert, after 12 years of creating, guiding, and maintaining
<I>In Context</I>, took a sabbatical year (self-supported) in Europe --
to look at sustainability from outside the US, to be with Diane as she co-produced
the Eco-Villages Conference at Findhorn, and to take his own in-breath.
The staff he had trained here in the US put out four issues of the journal.
Toward the end of the year Robert, as the Institute's Director, analyzed
the state of the journal and concluded that CI couldn't go on using print
as a medium for its work.</P>

<P>Like many small publications these days, <I><U>In Context</U></I><U>
was in deepening financial trouble</U>, taking the Institute further into
debt with every issue printed. On top of that, <U>its stately quarterly
pace had simply become too slow</U> -- information moves constantly and
instantly in the 90's.</P>

<P>Robert proposed that CI move <I>In Context </I>onto the Web to continue
its mission of fostering sustainability -- sustainably. The Institute would
cut costs astronomically, would get the message to many, many more people
than the journal's 6,000 (and falling) print subscribers, and those messages
could go out around the globe the minute they were written. He even figured
out how people <I>not</I> on the Web could still get <I>In Context</I>.</P>

<P>Robert expected CI's Board of Directors to agree that more outreach,
faster, for less money, made sense. He was wrong. The board, it turned out,
was deeply divided.</P>

<P>The Gilmans came back to the US and a long, painful negotiation with
those Board members and staff who wanted to stay with print -- and change
the mission and leadership of the organization. Eventually this part of
the Board formed Positive Futures Network to publish <I>Yes</I>, which would
report on &quot;the emerging culture.&quot;</P>

<P>The full Board also decided to donate a goodly portion of Context Institute's
assets (including the asset/obligation of the subscriber list) to PFN to
help them get started. More months of negotiation over just what assets
should go to PFN followed -- and kept us from communicating directly with
you before now.</P>

<P>Of the many decisions made during this process, the one that has probably
led to the most confusion was agreeing that <I>Yes</I> could publish its
first issue with an <I>In Context</I> dust cover and describe itself as
&quot;a successor journal to <I>In Context</I>.&quot; That implied that
<I>In Context</I> wasn't alive and well -- in a new medium. It also implied
that <I>Yes</I> was a continuation of <I>In Context,</I> yet, whatever the
apparent similarities, its mission, world view and animating spirit are
-- appropriately -- different.</P>

<P><I>In Context</I> and <I>Yes</I> each has its own gifts to give to the
world, but this has been <U>a parting of the ways, not a passing of the
torch</U>. We apologize for CI's role in creating the image of descendancy.
It's important to both entities that you see them as they are: independent
and distinct from one another.</P>

<P>The Gilmans, joined by CI Board members Fred Noland, Bob Kincheloe and
Danaan Parry, remain on the CI Board. They've been joined by former member
Ellen Ghilarducci Camin and myself. Seven others have left, five to the
PFN Board and two to other activities.</P>

<P>The Institute has relocated from Bainbridge Island to Whidbey Island.
Here, <I>In Context</I> is staffed (again) solely by Robert and Diane with
their trusty computers, modems, phones, and -- very importantly -- their
living-lightly skills. A growing group of volunteers and a worldwide network
of pioneering thinkers is with them electronically, plugging their ideas
into <I>In Context,</I> as always.</P>

<P>As Robert planned, <I>In Context</I>'s expenses are now a fraction of
what they had been. (One-sixth, to be exact.) No printing and postage bills,
no long payroll. Money from speaking fees, product sales, and donations
is beginning to come in, but <U>it's going to take a little push from our
friends to get this stripped-down CI to sustainability</U>.</P>

<P>The now-tiny costs of the Institute's new operations (including their
absurdly modest salaries) should be assured so the Gilmans can get on with
what they've got to do -- for all of us, and for the future of our home
planet.</P>

<P>They've done the hard stuff: surviving a painful dividing up of much
that they had built, trimming costs, and tight-rope walking onto the Web
-- without a net. Now it's our turn. The enclosed letter from Robert tells
you how you can help create that net.</P>

<P>This is the last time you'll hear from us via your mailbox, so <U>don't
put this aside, waiting for our follow-up</U>. Please think about it now;
make your move now.</P>

<P>If you care about <I>In Context</I> and want to see its service to the
world thrive, fill out the enclosed support card and send it off in the
enclosed mailback envelope right away. All of us at Context Institute will
rejoice in your company, sustaining the work of creating a sustainable world.</P>

Dear Friend of <I>IN CONTEXT</I>,</P>

<P>It's good to finally be communicating with you directly! A lot has happened
during the past nine months. One part is the long conflict over Context
Institute and its assets that Ann describes in her accompanying letter.
Yet the more lastingly important part is what we've done to regroup, get
our new office functioning in Langley, and, best of all make sure that...</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><I><BR>
<FONT SIZE=+1>IN CONTEXT</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=+1> Continues!</FONT></B></P>

<P>At the end of 1995 we decided to move <I>IN CONTEXT</I> to the Internet's
World Wide Web. Now, nine months later, we've crossed that bridge, and I'm
happy to report that the Web is an even better medium for <I>IN CONTEXT</I>
than we expected - including being more accessible than we first thought.
(Even if you don't have direct access to the Web, <I>please keep reading</I>.
Later in this letter I tell you how you can still get new IC material without
direct access.)</P>

<P>This move is important fundamentally because it means we can now bring
the best of <I>IN CONTEXT</I>, both old and new, to a <I>much</I> wider
audience, <I>worldwide</I> - a world both more open to and more in need
of that material than even a few years ago. This move is not about technology;
it is about communications. For me it is also about remembering the larger
goal (a humane and sustainable world) and being willing to change as fresh
means become available, however fond we may have become of the old means,
so that we can be as effective in this work as possible. The needs of the
times are simply too urgent to do less.</P>

<P>Here's some of what we've done so far:</P>

<UL>
  <LI><B>Posted 6 back issues</B>, including IC #1! We plan, over the coming
  months, to post all 43 back issues, including all of the long out-of-print
  early issues. We see this as a profound shift from IC as a printed periodical
  to IC as a growing, living, electronic sustainability resource library.<BR>
  
  <LI><B>Started IC #44</B>, the first purely on-line issue, including some
  wonderful material by one of the early pioneers of the sustainability movement,
  Tom Bender. I say &quot;started&quot; because our publishing on the Web
  is an organic and participatory process. As a reader you get to watch each
  issue grow and, if you like, to contribute over the three months the issue
  is forming.<BR>
  
  <LI><B>Begun &quot;The Global Context,&quot; </B>a section on our site,
  to provide state-of-the-art summary information on trends <I>and alternatives</I>
  in the broad areas of Nature (earth, air, life, water); Humankind (education,
  health, demographics, population); Society &amp; Culture (from families
  to economics); and Hardware (buildings, transportation, etc.). It's an
  electronic &quot;global situation room&quot; with an <I>IN CONTEXT</I>
  perspective; a place where you can keep track of what is making history,
  rather than just news; where you can go smoothly from the largest vision
  to the most directly practical.<BR>
  
  <LI><B>Started a free email newsletter</B>, called 'ci-news', that lets
  people know about new additions to the Web site as well as other Context
  Institute news.
</UL>

<P>So far we've done little to publicize the site since we want this letter
to be the official &quot;going public.&quot; Nevertheless, in the last 3
months we've had over 26,000 &quot;hits&quot; (requests for pages) from
45 countries!</P>

<P>This is very much just the beginning. One of the additional possibilities
that we're particularly excited about is translating <I>IN CONTEXT</I> into
other languages. This would have been prohibitively expensive in print,
but on the Web it is just a matter of finding the right translators - and
they can be from anywhere in the world! (If you could translate even one
article, or know someone who might be interested in helping us, please get
in touch.)</P>

<P>We're excited! I feel like the spirit of <I>IN CONTEXT</I> is singing
as it spreads it wings in this new medium. And I also feel this spirit is
especially happy that...</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Now It's Free</FONT></B></P>

<P>People often ask me, &quot;If <I>IN CONTEXT</I> was failing financially
in print, how can you offer it for free on the Web?&quot; The answer is
simply that publishing via the Web (an option that has only become seriously
available in the last year or so) is so <I>enormously</I> less expensive
than publishing in print that, <I>if we can continue the level of donations
that IC was getting while in print</I>, we won't need to charge for subscriptions.</P>

<P>Publishing on the Web eliminates all the cost of printing and postage
(plus saving lots of trees!). Doing away with subscriptions eliminates all
the cost of processing subscriptions, sending renewal notices, etc. These
cost savings eliminate the need for costly advertising, further reducing
expenses (and junk mail!). All of these reductions also mean that there
is much less to manage, so I can again turn my attention to editing. The
end result is a <I>much</I> simpler, less costly process that focuses our
efforts on the essence of what <I>IN CONTEXT</I> is all about. We figure
we can now do for about $35,000 per year what used to cost us more than
$200,000 per year.</P>

<P>Yet it is even better. By offering the whole <I>IN CONTEXT</I> library
plus the new <I>Global Context</I> section on the Web we can:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Reach millions - and soon-to-be tens and hundreds of millions - of
  people. Current estimates have 200 <I>million</I> people using the Internet
  by 2000, just four years from now! We never reached more than 9,000 subscribers
  in print and by the end of last year we were down to under 6,000. Our Web
  site, without publicity, is already getting more hits than that every month!<BR>
  
  <LI>Be more useful to professionals, business people, government officials,
  and other decision-makers who need practical, quality information immediately.<BR>
  
  <LI>Better reach those future decision-makers called students (who are
  one of the larger Web user-groups).<BR>
  
  <LI>Reach people all over the world with equal ease and speed. We recently
  got the following: &quot;I used to be a subscriber in Caracas, Venezuela
  but now it is too expensive to have a PO Box in USA and our mail is not
  secure. I am very happy to find you in the Web so I can keep in touch with
  your excellent journal and organization.&quot; ... and this is just the
  beginning!<BR>
  
  <LI>Provide journalist/media people with a quickly-accessible, reliable
  source of quality material on sustainability, and through them reach additional
  hundreds of millions of people who don't have access to the Web.
</UL>

<P>Clearly, we now have the opportunity to take <I>IN CONTEXT</I> to a whole
new level of effectiveness while staying true to our fundamental vision
and roots. <I>IN CONTEXT</I> has never been about making money; it has always
been about encouraging a humane and sustainable future ... with vision and
integrity. Being able to offer it freely, without subscription, feels very
right and fitting to the needs of the times. We just hope there will be
enough people who share this vision and value this work so that we can get
the support we need.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><BR>
<FONT SIZE=+1>If you don't have access to the Web...</FONT></B></P>

<P>... how can you still get <I>IN CONTEXT</I>? Through networking and community.
Here is what we suggest:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Find someone who has access to the Web. It is quite likely that you
  have a friend or a relative (or a friend of a friend) who does.<BR>
  
  <LI>Get them to subscribe to the free email newsletter, 'ci-news'. They
  can do this through the Web site or by sending the email message:<BR>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;subscribe ci-news<BR>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end<BR>
  to 'majordomo@whidbey.net'.<BR>
  
  <LI>When ci-news informs them about new IC material on the Web site, get
  them to print it out for you.
</UL>

<P>This is a wonderful way to introduce that friend to <I>IN CONTEXT</I>
at the same time you are continuing your own connection. I think of it as
&quot;freeing two birds with one key.&quot;</P>

<P>Other alternatives are local libraries and schools which increasingly
have Web access. In fact, Web access is growing rapidly, is coming soon
to TVs, and will likely be as widespread as VCRs in a few years. We want
to be fully ready to greet all those people when then go looking for meaningful
alternatives.</P>

<P>If none of these options work for you, write or call us and we'll help.
We don't want <I>anyone</I> to miss out on <I>IN CONTEXT</I> simply because
they don't have direct Web access.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>How can you help?</FONT></B></P>

<P>If you care about <I>IN CONTEXT</I> and want to see it become an even
more effective catalyst for a humane and sustainable world, please find
some way to help. This is absolutely a time when we need your support.</P>

<P>Here are some possible ways:</P>

<UL>
  <LI><B>Send Context Institute a tax-deductible donation</B>. Remember,
  <I>IN CONTEXT</I> is now <I>primarily</I> supported by donations. Please
  help to show that people still care about <I>IN CONTEXT </I>and are willing
  to continue their support. In whatever amount, please do what you can.
  Send it to:

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>RESIDENTIAL SERVICE REQUEST INSTRUCTIONS</H2>

<P>It's easy to sign up and get at least 10% savings over your current plan.
Just:<BR>
</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Fill in one of the accompanying forms </LI>
  <LI>Print it out </LI>
  <LI>Sign it </LI>
  <LI>Mail it to Context Institute, PO Box 946, Langley, WA 98260 </LI>
</UL>

<P>We'll take care of the rest!<BR>
<BR>
It is helpful to have a copy of your most recent bills from your present
local telephone company and long distance carrier on hand as you fill out
the form. Remember to fill in <B>all</B> the requested information. (The
Federal Communications Commission [FCC] and your local phone company are
fussy about these details to make sure your phone service doesn't get switched
unless <B>you</B> want it switched.) <BR>
<BR>
Now, choose a form:<BR>
</P>

<UL>
  <LI><A HREF="afresfrm.htm">On-line form</A>, to be filled out on your computer.
  (It will still need to be printed out for your signature, and then mailed.)
  </LI>
  <LI><A HREF="afrespap.htm">Paper form</A>, to be filled out by hand. (Use
  this if you have more than 3 telephone numbers or if you can't print out
  the On-line form on one page.) </LI>
</UL>

<P><HR><BR>
</P>

<H3>Detailed Instructions</H3>

<P>You probably won't need these, but they are here just in case you do.
You can get to them via links from the forms.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="name"></A><B><I>Name</I></B><BR>
<BR>
This needs to be the <I>name under which your phone number is listed</I>
with your local telephone company (also referred to as the LEC, Local Exchange
Carrier). Copy it directly from a recent phone bill. It must be EXACTLY
as shown on the bill -- even if there is an incorrect spelling. <BR>
<BR>
If the name doesn't make an EXACT match with the local phone company's records,
it may be rejected.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="physical"></A><B><I>Phone Location Address</I></B><BR>
<BR>
The local phone company always identifies you by the physical location (address)
of your phone service, not by the billing address. Again, if the local phone
company doesn't see the information match in their system, the switch may
not be complete. If your physical location address is the same as your billing
address, or if your phone bill gives both, copy this directly from a recent
bill.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="billing"></A><B><I>Billing Address</I></B><BR>
<BR>
If you want your billing <I>from Affinity</I> sent to an address different
from your Phone Location Address, put it here. For this it makes no difference
what billing address your local phone company uses. It's your choice.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="numbers"></A><B><I>Telephone Numbers</I></B><BR>
<BR>
List each phone number at the Phone Location Address as they were issued
from the local telephone company. Attach an additional list if necessary.
Do not list any phone numbers other than those at this location.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="carrier"></A><B><I>Present Long Distance Carrier</I></B><BR>
<BR>
The name of your present long distance carrier, such as AT&amp;T, MCI, or
Sprint.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="plans"></A><B><I>Current Discount Calling Plan(s)</I></B><BR>
<BR>
For example, &quot;Reach Out America&quot; (AT&amp;T) or &quot;Friends &amp;
Family&quot; (MCI). This must be the plan(s) that you are currently signed
up for as indicated on your current bill. <BR>

<H1><CENTER>About This Issue</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by <A HREF="../../PEOPLE/RCGBio.htm">Robert Gilman </A></I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
Let's start with the bad news: our approach to creating our cities, neighborhoods,
buildings, and transportation systems is literally killing us. It is the
source of vast, though largely unperceived, negative effects on the natural
environment, our economy, our communities, our health, and the quality of
our lives. 
<UL>
  <LI>We're building structures and communities that alienate us from each
other and from the natural environment. 
  <LI>The materials used in the construction of buildings normally contain
enough toxins to make some of us very sick and many of us chronically uncomfortable.
  <LI>Many popular building materials are extracted at enormous cost to
fragile ecosystems in various parts of the planet. 
  <LI>Land-use patterns in many areas make life without an automobile nearly
impossible, contributing to our wasteful use of finite fossil fuels and
to the automobile's dubious distinction as the world's largest single source
of pollution. 
</UL>
<BR>
Meanwhile, we ignore or waste resources freely provided to us in the form
of indigenous materials, rain, sunshine, fresh air, and landscaping.<BR>
<BR>
The scope of the problem is vast. For example: 
<UL>
  <LI>Buildings account for more than 40 percent of all US energy use, in
terms of both energy for materials and construction, and energy for heating,
lighting, equipment, etc. 
  <LI>Building placement - land use - dictates much of our need for transportation,
which accounts for 26 percent of US energy use. 
</UL>
<BR>
So altogether, about <I>two-thirds</I> of US energy use is determined by
the current way we design our buildings and our communities. This energy
use in turn has major impacts on global warming, acid rain, the trade deficit,
and our foreign policy. <BR>
<BR>
Clearly, there is simply <I>no way</I> we can achieve a sustainable future
without major changes in our built environment.<BR>
<BR>
Fortunately, as the articles in this issue demonstrate, there is a lot of
good news. Sustainable design has matured to the point where it can deliver
a built environment with a <I>much </I>lower environmental impact while
<I>enhancing </I>health, community, and quality of life - all while saving
money!<BR>
<BR>
Indeed, the news about sustainable design is <I>so </I>good that we are
likely on the verge of a revolution in the building industry that will totally
reshape our communities over the next few decades. <BR>
<BR>
This issue is a report from the front of that revolution.<BR>

<H4><CENTER><I>An interview with Francois Monnet, by <A HREF="../../PEOPLE/RCGBio.htm">Robert
Gilman</A></I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
<B>Robert:</B><I> What was the village you grew up in like?<BR>
<BR>
</I><B>Francois:</B> The village had 600 people, with most of them farmers,
and more recently some people (because there is a problem in France like
everywhere), going to make some work with enterprises like building houses,
working in small factories. When I was little, it was really a farming village.
You know, our games were to jump on the back of the cows, to play with the
rabbits, go and pick dandelions and grass for the rabbits along the paths.
Everyday when I came back from school, my mother would give me a basket
- in the spring - and send me to pick dandelions where I could find some,
along the river, anywhere, and that was the salad for the evening. In all
the village, little kids did that. In our house, we had a huge bread oven,
made by my grandfather, in which we burned big bundles of fuel, and we baked
the bread in it. We baked like 40 kilo of bread at a time. That was all
part of the old tradition.<BR>
<BR>
When I was little, until I was ten years old, gypsies were still very much
traveling with horses and wagons, and we had a stable. We had no more horses,
but we had a stable. They would come and put their horses in the stable,
stop their wagons, come eat with the family, and tell us a lot of interesting
stories. Out of that a bridge was created. Already somehow I realized there
was something else than just the village. Those gypsies, you look at their
faces - they look like no one else. They look like a . ., I did not know
what they look like, but they were brown with black eyes. Those people are
from India, more or less. I mean, the gypsies came thousands of years ago
from India. Many of them are an incredible Indian type when you know it,
you look at it. They had a sense of music, of storytelling that was completely
different from the farmers around. They were the people of the road. As
far as I know there have been only two kinds of people on the earth, the
nomadic civilization and the pastoral, agricultural civilization. There
are the people staying and the people moving. The people moving bring news,
new techniques. So, somehow, after their visits my life became a combination
of that. It is a new phenomenon that we see much now today. The new nomads
are appearing again in their big home buses and doing what the gypsies did.
Anyway, in our village, the gypsies were hated by people, because that is
a very old story. The settled men have always disliked the nomads, because
the nomad people endanger their values and security somehow.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Robert:</B><I> What were some of the other things, good and bad, you
saw in village life?<BR>
<BR>
</I><B>Francois:</B> Of course, that village I was born in was not the village
that impressed me the most. I even left it quite early, but afterwards I
lived in other villages that were even more typical, more traditional. In
France, in Morocco (I lived in a village or so in Morocco), and they were
more pastoral villages because I chose to be a shepherd for some years.
Also in Norway, a fishing village. People who lived from fishing, from cutting
trees, making furniture and selling a bit of wood, having some sheep in
the mountains. So that kind of village life was the one that was most interesting.<BR>
<BR>
The value of a village? I'll have to think about that, because for me I
can not imagine any other life than village life, so consequently it is
very hard for me to see the value of village life. It is like if you asked
me, &quot;What's the value of love for a couple?&quot; And I think, well
I don't know. Any city I see is for me a nonsense. I can love the people,
like in New York. I loved New York because there was a big humanness in
New York, but at the same time, from the beginning for me the city is a
nonsense, it's absurd. It's like a big octopus with suckers pumping the
countryside around. A city has no life of itself. If the trucks that bring
the vegetables and the food to the city stop for only two days, the city
would collapse, die. If you cut the electricity, if you cut . . the city
is a completely artificial life. A village can live and live and live for
hundreds of years if you cut all those things because it's on the Mother
Earth, on the living Earth, and because the number of people is small and
all that. I mean, a village, with all its mistakes and jealousy is a natural
self that breathes and has a pulse. It might be sick in some places, but
its alive. For me, the big thing is that a city is unreal. Of course, there
are humans, so we love it. We'll go there, but the city is biologically
unreal, it doesn't live of itself, it has no life of itself. Everything
you touch in a city is dead. It does not evolve, it's paving, it's stones.
There is no life in a city of itself, therefore it's hard for me to say
what is good in a village, because the only life I see as possible for human
beings is a village life.<BR>
<BR>
A hamlet life, or village life, or community life is a life where you know
every one of the people you live around. I think that when the village becomes
so big that you don't know everyone who lives around, you must stop the
growth. I think everything you must reach with your hands and with your
feet, like within a stroll of half an hour, for example. The world is at
the tip of our finger. When it stops being reachable by the tip of our finger,
it becomes monstrous, it escapes us.<BR>
<BR>
What is good in a village is hard for me to say in that way. I really see
that it is the only possible life, is village life. I see very much like
Gandhi visualized it, a world of decentralized village democracies. That
is the way he called it, or a gentle anarchy he called it. I see very much
that the best way to be interdependent with our heart and the best way to
feel we are one is to first be very independent with our basic needs. If,
for example, I am too much depending on you for my clothes or for my food
or for my fuel, it would be very hard to have really clean relations at
the level of the heart. Maybe I have a truth to say to you. &quot;Eh, Robert,
I think that's not right with you.&quot; Your attitudes or whatever. I won't
say it because you're furnishing me with the wood. I won't dare to say to
you the truth that you need as a friend, because you might take it bad and
you might not give me wood anymore. Therefore, hypocrisy comes very quickly
if we are too dependent on the material level. We need to be self- sufficient,
like decentralized village democracies, as much as possible. When I say
village, I mean a real village, not a residential village. I mean a village
where there are gardens, goats, cows, a little dairy - a village like a
community we see today. To be as much, as much, as much as possible self-sufficient
on all the basic levels of clothes, shelter, warming, fuel, building is
the best way to have the best possible relation with the next village because
our relation is really coming from the heart. It is like people who married
for money, or who married to get a bigger estate. It is very hard to keep
the love pure in that way, but if you are marrying someone who has nothing
to give you, you have nothing to give her materially, it's just love. I
believe very much that the best way to clear up our relationships all over
the planet is self-sufficiency.<BR>
<BR>
I don't see self-sufficiency as a kind of isolation. For me it is not the
opposite of communication. It is the best way to start clear on our communication,
because our communication must be coming from the heart. We go to the next
village for a feast, or we go to the next village because we want to see
other people who are a bit different from us. We don't go there because
we are going to please them so that in return we are going to get this or
that. All over the world the economy is based on that. The planet has become
such a place of lies, and hypocrisy, and a wrong vibration between people
and countries. So I see the village as being very independent economically.<BR>
<BR>
Another aspect I will say about that thing is a more spiritual aspect. For
example, why a village should be self- sufficient, or why we, in our little
farm, homestead, should be. We were really striving, working hard on that
idea that <I>here is </I>the place we are going to depend on; to have our
cultural life, our spiritual life, our material life, our food, everything,
because that's more spiritual. For me it is as important. I don't speak
about the economic factor. Oh [changing his mind], very quickly, we did
not want imported products or oranges. We bought no products from other
countries, especially not at all from poor countries, but not even from
other countries, because we know that when you get oranges, for example,
from Morocco in France, it's the cheapest fruit, because in Morocco people
are starving. They are paid less than nothing to pick the oranges, and where
they pick the oranges, they can not grow their own vegetables. And if some
people try to grow their vegetables, they are put in jail. It happens the
same in Honduras and El Salvador with the bananas, so we must stop eating
those things clearly and simply, because it means suffering and it means
unrighteousness in other parts of the world.<BR>
<BR>
But the other aspect of it is also that for me importing things is like
saying to God, &quot;Hey, your world is not well done. We have not enough
vitamin C here, we need oranges.&quot; And it's not true. He will tell you,
&quot;No, you have enough. Look, you have wild rose hips here, or you have
this or that.&quot; We saw that in our place where we lived in Norway. The
balance of nature was perfect. You could grow, and you could pick in the
wild, and you could fish, and you could find everything that the body needs,
for shelter, for everything. So using things that are around you is a kind
of way to say to the great spirit, &quot;Hey, it's perfect. Look, I have
everything I need here.&quot; That's the best way to express your total
gratefulness towards the creator who made the world perfect, in every place
it's perfect. Eskimos might eat only meat and seal fat and clothe themselves
with seal skins. It's perfect for them. Any place has all it needs for keeping
a human alive, and not only alive, but happy and everything, so self- sufficiency
is a way to express your contentment, your satisfaction. Dependency is a
way to express your dissatisfaction, and your everlasting discontent - you
are never satisfied. You want an orange, you want bananas, you want coffee,
you want this. It doesn't grow here, but you want it. It's a way to say,
we have not enough. It's like if we are in a house together and I am always
running away. It's like if you are married with a woman, and are always
going to sleep some nights with another woman, because you are not in love
with the first woman. It's a bit what we do when we are not satisfied with
what we are. The earth is a woman, is a beautiful queen. Around here we
have everything we need, and we will express our satisfaction and contentment
by developing all our senses and exploring around and seeing that around
is everything we need, to transform it into food, into art, into beauty,
into shelter - everything is here.<BR>
<BR>
So therefore, it comes back to the big wisdom and knowledge of the tradition.
To see that, I had to take my bag on my back and go to see people who know
that. All over Europe, in some places of Germany, some places of Scotland,
especially the mountainous parts, some places of Spain, Italy, or Morocco,
or Norway, there are people who have built their houses only with the local
wood. Where all food and recipes are made only with the things that grow
around. In Norway, the basic food was potatoes, bread, fish, and milk, which
is only about four things, some berries, but from those things, thousands,
hundreds of different kinds of bread, recipes, hundreds of ways of making
milk, you know, preparing milk. You are not going to run after exotic things,
but see how you can use in depth all the local things. It is the same in
the way to honor stone and wood. You are not going to learn it from the
world today. You open a recipe book, you are sure half of the products are
from India, from Africa, some are local. We have no more that sense of integrity
of things being here. So you have to go to the places where the tradition
still exist to learn that wisdom and that kind of good way to use the local
things.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Robert:</B><I> Could you say more about the places you have been in your
travels?<BR>
<BR>
</I><B>Francois:</B> I can say very quickly the places that have especially
impressed me. First place I went to was Lapland; I went to Finland and then
Lapland. By an accident, a good accident, I got lost more or less in the
tundra, working there. I met some Lapps and I stayed seven months with the
nomad Lapps people who are living with reindeer and in tipis. And there
I think I had the chance to really experience the nearest thing we know
of the arctic and Indian culture. Eskimos, Indians, and Lapps had many basic
things the same. The Lapps people are the only people today, with maybe
some Eskimos, who really still live undisturbed their way of life. They
have slowly modernized a bit, but their values are basically the same. They
have never been exterminated like Indians in America, put in reservations.
Lapland is the place where Lapps have lived hundreds and hundreds of years.
So I lived with those Lapps. It was the first time my set of values was
disturbed completely by a new set of values that was very beneficial.<BR>
<BR>
I can explain briefly the life of the Lapps people. They are part of that
arctic population. They are the reindeer people, like some Eskimos were
caribou people. They make their clothes out of reindeer skin, they still
do today. They live off reindeer meat. They sleep on reindeer skins. They
herd flocks of reindeer. Not all the Lapps do that, to make things clear,
only 20% of the Lapps still live that way of life. They are the rich Lapps.
They look poor, they look ragged, they look smokey, they smell strong, but
they are the rich Lapps. If you ever go there, you will not be fooled about
that. Many other Lapps have had to abandon that way of life, and they are
either working as fishermen, with Norwegian Fishermen, or working in local
lumbering industry, or different things. Also, a very interesting group
of Lapps are living along the riversides, or by the lake where they combine
fishing - salmon and trout - and selling those salmon and trout and other
kinds of fish, I don't know the name in English, and making some Lapps'
crafts like knives and shoes. Lapps shoes are very renowned for winter.
They are very good. They are made only of reindeer skin - a kind of moccasin.
They are so good that many Norwegians also use them. And they make a beautiful
knife that is very renowned - a very, very good knife. They also make a
nice river boat, kind of a canoe. They grow some potatoes, they might have
a few sheep, and the reindeer which they use for packing and milking in
some parts. So they are a bit with reindeer, a bit with farming, and a lot
of hunting - ptarmingan and arctic hare, and eating reindeer meat a bit.
But they are farmer/Lappscraftsmen - that mixture, and fishermen in the
lakes. A very interesting breed of people. Very similar to the people on
the west coast of Norway where I live. That mixture of many aspects. The
craftsman aspect, the farmer aspect, and the hunter or wild nomad aspect
mixed in one man - very interesting.<BR>
<BR>
But those Lapps I lived with are mostly the nomadic Lapps. I can say a few
things about those people. When I went to the Lapps and started to stay
with them, they were just going to kill some reindeer before the big migration.
I must say, the Lapps people are herding reindeer flocks, but in fact they
have no control over the reindeer flock. What happens is that the inside
part of Lapland is marshes and lakes and is very full of mosquitoes in summer,
and a swamp. You might have a place like that in northern Canada, tundra
like and wet. The north is rocky shores, with fresh wind, salty air and
nice green pasture on those rocky shores. The reindeer have always moved,
like a pendulum, during the year. When the summer comes and the snow melts
on the tundra, mosquitoes start to appear, swamps are dangerous, it is very
hard to walk there. The reindeer on the last snow have the instinct of going
when the last snow is still hard to the sea, and when they arrive there,
there is green pasture just ready for them. But in winter, the seashore
is terribly windy, stormy. It is just impossible to stand there. By instinct
the reindeer on the first snow go back to the tundra, which then is frozen
so it is not dangerous with swamps, it is not wet, there are no mosquitoes.
What they do is dig the snow with their hoof and get lichen and moss from
under the snow. So in winter they are in the tundra and in summer they go
on the coast. The reindeer follow that big movement and the Lapps people
just follow them. The Lapps people are just on the watch all the time. They
mark their reindeer. They bite their hair and make some marks. So a man
has reindeer, &quot;That's my reindeer, that's your reindeer.&quot; But
in fact, it's very funny, because they appropriate reindeer, which are theirs,
but they follow their wild instincts. Man decides nothing. It is a very
interesting aspect of controlling nature but still nature is free. So they
follow those flocks of reindeer.<BR>
<BR>
When I first came there and met the people, they were going to kill their
reindeer in the end of the summer to migrate back. They always kill a lot
of reindeer before the migration. That's the control of man. They gather
them in a very special way that I won't explain now. It would take hours
to speak of their life. When they are gathered, they kill a big part of
the ones who will die along the way anyway, old ones or sick ones, many
young males. They don't want to keep so many young males. It doesn't make
the flock grow. They will be skinned, the skin will be salted. Part of the
skin will be sold. The nicest skin they keep for themselves, for clothing.
Some part is for shoes, some part for gloves, everything. Sinews, they still
sew with the sinews there. They use the sinew on their teeth; they spin
them somehow, and they sew the shoes with the sinews. The sinews get bigger
when there is water; it makes the shoe completely tight. So they really
live off the reindeer, they really are still the reindeer people.<BR>
<BR>
When I was there I saw those people, and they were very nice with me and
very smiling. And occasionally on a little fire outside they would make
some cafe with a piece of reindeer meat, and they would just let me have
some. After one day or two I asked them if I can help them to work. I get
no answer. Also ask if I can sleep here, if I can be there a few days -
never an answer. Sometimes a kind of mumbling, but no answer. But I could
see that they did not dislike me. You can feel, you know. I don't think
they dislike me, I think it's all right. I felt some nice smiles, sometimes
jokes, and twinkling of the eyes. But each time I wanted to have a clear
answer, a clear something about something - no answer. In Europe, I was
used to ask, can I do this or can I do that. &quot;Can I help you?&quot;
You get an answer with civilized people. For days it went on. I never got
an answer. So I started to do the job of the little kids and the young girls,
because work is very organized like that. And they just laughed; made some
funny song about me, because they have those song relations with them, like
Indians have the same kind of songs. I became ready to be part of their
fun, of their life, but never still could I get an answer. And for days,
I saw them going in their tipis, their kind of tipis, and I had never seen
a tipi in my life. I had never been inside. You can imagine being born in
a little village in France, having read stories about Indians, and I thought,
&quot;Oh, I would like to see a tipi inside, so really magic.&quot; They
all went in and out and laughed a lot, and drank schnapps and that whiskey,
and sang. I could not just be with them, they never invited me.<BR>
<BR>
I thought, really those people are very strange. I am with them, I help
them a bit, and they are very friendly, but they never invite me into their
tipis. Anyone that I had worked with in France would have invited me in.
It was kind of a block. One day I asked a young girl, &quot;I would not
like to disturb, but if I could go in your tipi . . .&quot; I was very stupid
and using gloves to speak. And she said, &quot;Phew&quot;. She called all
the girls and she explained what I said, and they laughed at me and mocked
me and pushed me and said, &quot;You are stupid, go in.&quot; And then later,
people really made clear to me, in their country, you don't ask things.
You are a man, aren't you? Don't you know what is good and right? Don't
you know what you need? Why are you asking like a little child if you can
stay, if you can work, if you can go in? Don't you see, if you are cold,
it is cold outside and warm inside. What are you doing standing in the doorway?
Go in. They have that kind of clear logic. They have done without all our
politeness and all our introductions. They don't have it. They don't even
say thank you, usually. I remember one day I bought a lot of chocolate because
I had been in the little village. I knew everyone liked chocolate, and I
liked chocolate. I would not do it now because I'm more conscious about
it, but then I brought a big packet, and gave it to the people - some people
I had been with a lot. Nobody thanked me. Everybody ate it. Well, if I wanted
to give chocolate, it was my own pleasure, wasn't it. If I want to give
it, I want to give it. We are not going to make a big thing about it. That
does not mean they were not grateful. Themselves, they gave me a lot of
things, like a bunch of people (I never suspected they were doing it) they
had started to make clothes for me, with reindeer, beautiful decorated clothes.
They gave it to me and I said, &quot;Ah, thank you!&quot; They told me,
&quot;Eh, come on, that's all right.&quot; I had the same experience walking
in the tundra for days and seeing finally a little house with smoke. I banged
the door with my bad reflex, my old reflex. Nobody opened the door. It was
storming outside! After a while, someone opened the door, a bit upset. &quot;Why
don't you come in?&quot; Inside I asked, can I have some meat. They just
get upset. &quot;Of course you can have some meat. There is meat here. Why
do you ask?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
With us, you go to a place, and I ask you, for example, &quot;Can I stay
a week at your place?&quot; You tell me yes. Then somehow what can happen,
because there is a lazy man in us, once you have told me I can stay a week
I have the assurance for a week you will not throw me out. Then I might
be very lazy during that week. Not very conscious of what needs to be done.
Not very conscious that your home is my home in both ways - I must also
care for it, care for your child, really support the house with you. You
have told me I have a guarantee for a week. I am supported. I am accepted.
So what happens sometimes, your mind gets lazy and during your week you
let yourself be a guest. But those people are never going to tell you you
can stay a day or two days.<BR>
<BR>
I was suddenly put in front of a situation that was almost too much for
me. My capacity of judgment almost broke down, because I was suddenly put
in front of a tremendous challenge of deciding for myself and myself alone.
I had no one to give me permission or interdiction. I was there naked and
alone before people I did not know, and the door was completely open, which
was quite scaring. I could sleep there, I could eat there, and at the same
time I knew I could not sleep there and eat there indefinitely. For the
first time in my life I had to know what was the limit. I would think, I
need to sleep there tonight; normally, tomorrow morning I had better go
away, but they would let me stay anyway. But what do I really want, is it
to stay with those people? No, what I am doing is traveling through this
country. Maybe you do not realize, but we are so used to rest on other people.
All our society is like that. You are allowed to walk on the lawn here but
not there. Suddenly you are in a place where everything is allowed, but
you know perfectly that not everything is possible and not everything is
wise. You suddenly have to make very strong choices, because those people
are never going to answer, &quot;Can I help you?&quot; You have to ask yourself,
&quot;Should I help, does he want the help? OK, I'll help, but what should
I do?&quot; Then you have to observe more, because people are not going
to show you what you are going to do. They never told me how I could help
them, so I had to make a special effort of imagination and observation to
see how I could help them. It was a very great teaching for me. You can
see the point?<BR>
<BR>
Another aspect that might interest you (because that is village life). The
Lapps people are living in cedes - ceda means small community. A cede is
5 to 7, maybe 10, but usually 5 to 7 families. There is no leader. Every
year they chose a leader for the migration, but it is changing all the time,
so they have no leader. They have 7 families, for example living together.
They live as separate families, but they manage the flock of reindeer together.
Each family has its quantity of reindeer. They function like a little tribe.
It does not have the aspect of &quot;That's our tribe and we are very different
from the next tribe.&quot; Most Lapps' cedes are the same. They have been
grouped for generations into that 7 family group which migrate with that
large flock of reindeer together. It might be 12,000 or 15,000 reindeer
for a cede which is divided between each family. So that's the cede.<BR>
<BR>
Now inside the cede there's something very interesting. When I was with
the Lapps, and I stayed a long time there and much with young people, I
noticed there was almost no generation conflict. Sometimes there were arguments,
but the reason was not generation. Someone was in a bad mood or someone
was arrogant, you know. There were fights, but not the typical generation
conflict I was used to - very smooth, the passage of age was very smooth.
I investigated more and I learned something very interesting about their
inheritance system. Their inheritance system is like, for example, if I
am a Lapp and I own 600 reindeer, and I fall in love with that Lapp girl,
Tanya, who has 600 reindeer. We marry; we have 1200 reindeer. First child
we get, the day he is born, he gets from us 1 reindeer. For his first tooth,
he adds 1 reindeer, and so it goes on. When a child is seven years old,
he maybe has twenty reindeer. Second child comes, same thing. As the parents
grow older, they get less reindeer. It is like two vessels communicating
slowly. You can see that? <BR>
When I was 10, I got my first pocket money, and I would beg my parents to
get so much for this and that. Always it created conflict, such that after
a while, I wanted to go away from home and be independent, which you have
done, probably everyone has done. I wanted to be independent from my old
folks, not always asking them for money. It doesn't happen with the Lapps,
because from the beginning they don't make the difference that the parents
are the owners, the givers of money and the children are those dependent
persons. When a child is 10 years old he has maybe 18 reindeer. I don't
know, it depends on the size. So what happens, when a child is 10 years
old, if he has a fancy of, &quot;When we go to the town next time, I want
to buy a gold arm band,&quot; - something not useful? The parents aren't
going to say anything. It is your reindeer. You lose. So when the killing
will come he will say I want to kill that and that reindeer. It is not unusual
to see very small kids deciding which reindeer we are going to kill. They
will have money from that or they want the skin. From very young, the reindeer
are owned by the whole family. When the people are getting old, like 60
or 70 years old, obviously they have few reindeer, but they have still like
30 reindeer. Just enough. What do two old folks need? Not very much. They
eat less, they are not so interested about jewelry, nice clothes, and things
like that. It has all gone smoothly.<BR>
<BR>
Somehow we do the same, but much more complicated, much more unfair. And
that meant that there was no generation problem, because most of the generation
problem is an economic conflict. It does not seem like that, but it is like
that, because once you are twelve or thirteen, you want to use your energy
in such and such direction, and you need money somehow - unless you live
a different way of life. But, you need money or some material way to express
it. You have to ask your parents, and if your parents are a bit narrow minded,
you have to start to use flattery. You have to start to be crooked, you
know, to get the money from your folks. First you ask Papa, and then you
ask Mama - you start to use crooked ways, and lies, and flattering- something
not clean even in your family. The family should be a sacred place where
we don't need to do that, but it starts in the family.<BR>
<BR>
It is the same with relationships. You have a girl friend. You are 13 years
old, you want to sleep with her, but you aren't going to say, &quot;I am
going to sleep with my girl friend.&quot; You say, &quot;I am going to Bob's;
we are going to play badminton together,&quot; while in fact you go to Kathleen's
or wherever. You tell lies to your parents.<BR>
<BR>
The Lapps people, they have this thing. When the young kids are 13 or 14
years old, all boys and girls go away for two weeks. They go away camping,
and they do what they want. They make love, they have experiences. People
have a lot of premarital sexual experience, friendly experience, and the
parents don't put their noses in at all. So those two things, economics
and relationships, are not controlled by the parents. That's your life.<BR>
<BR>
One other thing I saw in the village life of the Lapps people, I saw little
kids who were 2 1/2 years old using huge Lapps' knives - chop, chop, chop.
They would split wood, cut wood, make a fire. They would take big salmon,
cut them, take the guts away, roast and separate them. 2 1/2 3, 4 years
old they already knew how to handle an ax and a knife without cutting themselves,
or maybe they learned with some cuts. The grown-ups, parents are completely
placid, calm beside a 2 1/2 year old child using a huge, very sharp knife,
splitting a little piece of wood. I was used to see the same situation in
our culture, like in France you would have had half of my sisters or aunts
screaming, &quot;Yehaa! He is going to cut himself!&quot; So very young,
they learn to be man and woman, living with nature, and they become very
clever. I have seen sometimes some young girls, 13 years old or something
like that, going to ski alone for two days, to hunt ptarmingan, in the cold,
cold snow of the arctic. And people will not worry, because children are
very much faced with real life.<BR>
<BR>
The children have very few toys. Some little kind of funny things made of
bone, but the whole thing is life. Since that time, and now after years
I have become more and more sure of one thing. I think toys are hell for
children. I think all those toys we give to children cause incredible confusion.
If we have a life which is interesting, you live by the land, you are a
craftsman, you go picking berries, what do you need a toy for? We need toys
because our life as grown-ups is so boring that we have to throw them some
things to play with. But as soon as you have a life that is related to living
things, trees, bark, small stones, anything you work with, the toys just
fade. We have never used toys with our daughter, and she does not want toys.
We have been visiting people who have toys, and the conflict starts straight
because as soon as the toys come, the &quot;Mine! No Mine!&quot; starts.
But with the things of daily life there is very little of that, because
you can't claim, that table is yours, that tree is mine. But those toys
are that kind of exciting thing on that level of mine and yours, ego level
for children. I also see the confusion toys bring. It's like toys are so
much made of that world we live in - just gadget, gadget, gadget. Toys are
that gadget world we have thrown at the feet of our children, who in fact
are very pure and kind of innocent and very open beings who don't need that,
who don't want it, who can do without it, and who develop themselves much
better without it. So somehow, seeing the life of the Lapps children, and
all those things I have seen after, and seeing negative things in families,
has really made me think, let's grow our child in a clear world, simple.
Not a boring world. We will have games, we will have fun together, fun in
learning. We don't need all those things. It is so bad to have little children
using the mine and yours, the material possessions, that you are something
big because you have a big red plastic truck, I am better than you because
I have a big doll, or I am better than you because my Papa is rich and can
buy me an electric train. I think that is already corrupting the child's
world from the beginning. What I will do is give my daughter a good knife
soon. I don't want to put her in danger, but I want her to come into life
with us. We go together and do the things of life, and I see that she is
a very happy little girl in that way. That is the Lapp's people's way of
education.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Robert:</B><I> What are some of the difficulties you have seen in village
life.<BR>
<BR>
</I><B>Francois:</B> I think one of the big dangers of village life, which
is the same as community life, is that once you start to have a good life
in a village, you imagine you have the best life. Especially when you start
to have difficulties in your village, you try to upgrade yourself by seeing
that you are much better than the other. Because you quickly realize that
it's not heaven, even a little village or a community, so you need to get
some strength from somewhere. Then you fall again in the same old thing,
you have to find an enemy, someone who is bad. And very early, one of the
first experiences that comes in community or village life is that thing,
that &quot;We are the right village, or the right community.&quot; Like
self- righteousness or village mind and that destroys the whole thing. Village
life has been here for thousands of years, and it has been war for thousands
of years because of that spirit, because of thinking that we are the only
one we are right, or we are the best village. So I think that as soon as
a village is started or a community is started, in parallel, constantly
should be kept that spirit of honoring the next village, honoring the next
culture, honoring the next religion. Not adopting the next religion or the
next village's ways of doing, but honoring it. Really appreciating the good
of other villages so that we can be a constellation of many villages, honoring
each other.<BR>
<BR>
The other thing is that very often in village life, and I see it also in
community life, certain roles get filled and are then not available to other
people. Some families even become forever the stupid people, forever the
wise family. There is a perpetuation in roles. I can remember a man in my
village where I was born, which was in many ways not a very good village,
who was an example of this. He was one of the men who has impressed me very
much in my life. He died when he was 60 about. When I was little, he was
45. He was a mason, a stone builder, and it happened that there was always
something to do at our house - rebuild the pig house, or make a wall there
around the garden. The masons from the village were very busy. There were
only 600 people in the village and 5 or 6 of them, yet they were very busy.
They were always 1/2 a day here, 6 hours there, 2 days there. They also
did a few other things - they would dig a garden if you asked them. They
were very flexible masons. That man, Joseph, came with another fellow. I
remember as a child how good that man was to me. He was so kind. He was
just kindness, like you would say Buddha was truth, he was kindness. He
was just kindness. I can really remember how impressed I was when sometimes
at the table when we ate, someone would say something a bit mean about someone
else. A slight criticism, and we were not very criticizing but still you
always drop a word without thinking, and he would always be there in a kind
of gentle way, almost with tears in his eyes, and say, &quot;Look, he is
a good man. He has done this and that.&quot; Always pointed at the good
of people. It happened at the same time that that man was the big, big drunkard
of the village. He swallowed 7 liters of red wine a day. I mean it. Seven
liters is almost 2 gallons. He was red, like a tomato. He was impregnated
with alcohol. So what is that man? As a statistic, he is an alcoholic and
nothing else. He is a man who has a problem. He never beat his wife or anything
like that, but he was sometimes brought home in a wheelbarrow. He is the
alcoholic of the village. For many people, that's all he was. And very few
people had the humility or the openness to see that he was an angel in that
village. He really was. Some people now say it, many reflect on how kind
he was, how good he was, but during the time he was living, people were
more preoccupied about his alcohol problem than about his heart.<BR>
<BR>
I see that as one of the reasons why many people run away from villages,
because very often in a village your true heart cannot grow. Why do you
fall in love and try to find someone who will love you? Because you want
to find someone who will know your true heart. Who will know that here deep
is a poet or a dreamer or something like that. That person knows it and
the company of that person is so important. She is a person who knows your
inside treasure, the pearl inside you. Why shouldn't we try to know the
precious pearl inside everyone in the village? But it happens that most
villages are just the opposite of that. A village is a place where it is
very hard to really let the precious pearl grow out. You are not allowed
to. People don't want to. There is a kind of voluntary, or maybe involuntary,
blindness. I really see that village life can be very hard and very terrible
about that. Roles are decided because of something that happened to you
in your childhood and because everyone knows you, or because your father
was this or that. Then you are not allowed to be something else. Especially
if someone is a drunkard, then he is just a drunkard, or if someone is an
old eccentric, he is just that. Maybe he is the philosopher of the village,
but people are going to look up at a philosophy book or people who speak
on the radio, not realizing that in their village they have a philosopher
of much bigger stature, who knows the village. They can not see that in
the village usually you have all those elements, the poet, the philosopher,
the singer. They usually are killed. They are killed in the nest. They are
not allowed to be that and they don't become that. You can not become a
singer if nobody listens to you. You can't become a poet, really, if nobody
listens to your poetry, asks for your poetry, and loves it.<BR>
<BR>
Another interesting aspect of community and village life is expansion. One
of the big trainings we concentrated on in our farm in Norway was this point
of expansion and progress. We started the first year with one cow, a horse,
2 bee hives, 9 chickens, a boat, picking berries, and tending a garden.
We were doing all of those hundreds of little things. Apparently it looked
like a very little farm, but we were completely occupied all the time. But
the year after, we said, &quot;Eh, we could have 15 chickens.&quot; We just
started to have 15 chickens and the whole thing was out of balance. We are
very tempted as human beings to expand, like every year we think, eh, we
should make a bigger garden - dig a bit more, dig a bit more. It is not
only ambition, it can also be that you like something. Maureen likes to
pick blueberries. But she is so fanatic at picking blueberries because she
likes the little berries and the green leaves that the first year we had
too many blueberries. We could not eat them all. And then, because we had
spent two more days picking blueberries, we had not picked moss, or picked
the leaves from under the trees to make compost. Something hadn't been done.
If you want a way of life where you really keep in balance with every small
detail, you must not overdo anything, and you must control your ambition.
So what we realized after our experience in our little farm, was that after
the first or second year we found out what was good. We had only enough
garden, enough fish, enough milk, enough eggs with that minifarm. We had
to make a big effort to control our expansion, natural human expansion.
Towns are exactly that, they are uncontrolled expansion - bigger, bigger,
bigger. We found that we must not expand more. We tried with 4 beehives,
it was too much. We really saw, because we used no farm machinery, in fact
the limited need of human beings is very small, and we lived very well.
If you can control a cow, a horse, 12 chickens garden, some fishing, cut
your wood by hand, pick your medicinal herbs, weave your clothes - your
whole year is full of occupation. I will say leave a good quarter of the
time for feast and celebration, or your soul will die. So if you want to
consider that, man is, even before everything else, made for celebrating,
for dancing, for music, for beauty, for tenderness, for being together.
We realized, and we are hard workers and well organized, that with that
very small farm we had exactly enough. We had both enough work and enough
to eat and be happy. So what shall we do with our energy of expansion? And
we realized, eh, we turn it inside - we expand inside. So I say now, it
is a great time to look a bit at the science of numbers. Start to see that
you have ten fingers, two hands, two feet, not more. Everything in man is
limited. It can be extremely blooming if we know our limits. Gandhi said
that for him one of the places where he got so much strength was when he
discovered his own limits. From the discovery of his own limits, he discovered
the limits of man in general. He could really use, within his limits, his
power to the maximum.<BR>
<BR>
Within a village life, it's very important. All villages want to grow bigger
than the next village or just expand for its own sake. Any community, any
congregation of monks can fall into the same trap - expansion. Francis of
Assisi started with a handful of monks, with simplicity, poverty, really
referring to nature and what God has written on the clouds and trees. Now,
you go in Franciscan Monasteries, they are full of books, they have money
in banks. The spirit of Francis of Assisi is completely gone - because of
expansion. I can really see the new age can be completely gone into expansion.
Everything can disappear into that expansion, into that material expansion.
In a normal village, maybe 50 or 60 people - I see a really small village,
you know - when we want to expand, we have too much energy. Let's expand
inside, inward. Instead of explosion, implosion. We need to expand outward
up to a point to sustain our lives, but then the wisdom comes here - stop
at the optimum. Expand inward in quality, in delicacy, in nuances. We saw
in living rather primitively ourselves, that when you start to use that
energy inside instead of outside is when you really start to become civilized.<I><BR>
<BR>
I HAD the good fortune to meet Francois while we were both visiting communities
in Oregon. He grew up in a village in southern France, blessed with a mother
who read Gandhi. Early on, he decided that he wanted to learn from life
rather than schools, and he has spent many years traveling and apprenticing
throughout Europe. During the last 5 years he has lived with his wife Maureen
and daughter Laila on a small farm in northern Norway in a tiny fishing
village that has four other families.</I><BR>

<BR>
AS WE REFOCUS our attention on community life, it is clear that, for many
of us, much has been lost. Even in rural areas within the U.S., current
community life is generally a fragmented shadow of what it used to be. In
our knowledge of community, we have become as children - lacking in experience
and out of touch with tradition. This can be a great handicap, but, paradoxically,
we can also turn it into a great asset. It can become an asset if we realize
that because we are not immersed in any strong traditions of community life,
we are thereby freer to draw on the experience of many different cultural
traditions. We can use our freedom from the immediate past to allow us to
reconnect with a much larger past. We can stretch ourselves to be planetary
in time, as well as outwardly in space and inwardly in spirit. At first
glance this may seem little more than a naive hope, a brave face put on
a bad situation, but the historical record suggests otherwise [20 , 22 -
see <A HREF="#anchor1570503">bibliography</A>], Time and again, significant
cultural innovations have come, not from the already strongly established
cultures, but from the fresh starts.<BR>
<BR>
Yet there is no guarantee that we will successfully turn our ignorance into
such an asset. History is also littered with &quot;fresh starts&quot; that
plunged ahead with naive self- confidence to repeat a well worn unsuccessful
pattern of the past. The key to making it work can perhaps be seen in the
way that most of the major conceptual advances in the sciences have come
from students and recent graduates [12] - still young enough to be uncommitted
to an established position, yet also actively drawing on the experience
and insight that others have to offer. Of course, there were always many
who studied while only a few had major insights. The extra element that
these few seem to have contributed is a sense of vision and inspiration
that enabled them to synthesize and go beyond the raw material of their
studies.<BR>
<BR>
With this motivation, I'd like to share with you my perceptions of some
of the characteristics of the major types of human communities, and the
key lessons that their long history has to offer to us now, as we work on
building a positive viable community life as part of a humane sustainable
culture. In this article I can only make a beginning on this vast subject,
and I hope others will add to this in future issues of <I>IN CONTEXT.</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Tribes and Bands</B><BR>
<BR>
Most of humanity's time here on this planet, more than 99% of it, has been
spent in groups of hunters and gatherers. Most of what we know about this
way of life comes, however, not from the distant past, but from groups (like
some Native Americans) who have continued with this way up into recent times.
From the work of anthropologists, from the traditional knowledge of these
groups, and from the little bit that can be gathered about the life of much
earlier groups, we can gain a partial picture of their life. While there
was a lot of cultural diversity, there were also some major common threads.
<UL>
  <LI><I>Mostly mobile </I>If you are to hunt and gather, you must go to
where the food is. For most groups this meant frequent moves, although in
some particularly rich habitats (like the American Pacific Northwest coast)
a settled life was possible. Those who moved did not just wander aimlessly,
but rather made a yearly circuit through a traditional territory. Bands
generally knew quite clearly what were the boundaries of their own and their
neighbors' territories.<BR>
<I><BR>
</I>
  <LI><I>Attuned to the land </I>Because these people lived on what the
local environment provided, they became minutely knowledgeable about the
local ecology, knowing the locales, habits, and potential human uses from
large numbers of plants and animals. This knowledge often went beyond the
immediately utilitarian to an understanding of complex ecological interrelationships
such as food chains and the role of trees in building soil fertility. Nor
was their relationship just intellectual; they felt a part of the natural
world and morally committed to help maintain its health and fertility.<BR>
<I><BR>
</I>
  <LI><I>&quot;Wealth&quot; non-material </I>One obvious consequence of
being mobile was that material possessions were more of a burden than a
bonus. Instead, knowledge, visions, songs and other such &quot;transportable&quot;
items were considered the important possessions. The wealthy were those
who were so skilled and knowledgeable (often of the supernatural as well
as the natural) that they could live well while carrying a minimum of tools.<BR>
<I><BR>
</I>
  <LI><I>The original affluent society </I>Although we might imagine their
lives to be extremely hard, the data suggests the opposite [18]. Even though
most of the last remaining bands of hunters and gatherers (and so those
for which we have good anthropological data) lived in harsh desert climates,
they generally spent no more than 4 to 6 hours a day providing for themselves.
This doesn't mean that there were no times of shortage and hardship, but
most of the time the living was fairly easy, and with no means of storage
and few possessions to make or maintain, &quot;sufficient unto the day was
the subsistence thereof&quot;.<BR>
<I><BR>
</I>
  <LI><I>Direct interpersonal knowledge </I>Groups differed in the degree
to which they had internal rankings and statuses, some being more egalitarian
than others, but in all cases, because they were small groups, everyone
knew everyone else as a whole human being and not just through one role.
Bands were typically in the range of 6 to 20 people, with tribes being self-acknowledged
collections of bands. This fullness of knowledge might grow thin in the
larger tribes, but there was little that could be hidden in the band.<BR>
<I><BR>
</I>
  <LI><I>Each group a world unto itself </I>These bands and tribes usually
knew about other neighboring groups but often had little to do with them.
The contact they did have involved raids, a little bit of trading, and occasionally
ritual gift exchanges.<BR>
<I><BR>
</I>
  <LI><I>Emphasis on the cyclic side of time </I>Living a life in which
the changes from year to year were minor compared to the changes of the
seasons and day to night, they viewed time as a constant cyclic context
in which events occurred, without our sense of the progression of history.
The exception to this is that they usually had myths that referred back
to a &quot;beginning of time&quot; when heroic or godlike figures established
the pattern of things and taught the people. Wisdom was from the past, to
be maintained and rediscovered, but not built upon, in the present.<BR>
<I><BR>
</I>
  <LI><I>Each could experience the heroic </I>Balancing this reverence for
the past was usually an encouragement for at least the males (though often
both sexes, each in their own way) to rediscover within themselves qualities
of the &quot;Great Ones&quot; from the past. Rites of passage and initiation
often involved a personal re-enactment of the heroic, creative, transformative
cycle (the pattern of withdrawal, facing and overcoming a critical challenge,
and return that occurs in stories, myths and lives throughout the world).
I want to emphasize that here &quot;heroic&quot; refers to inner strengths
rather than spectacular feats. It is not competitive but available to all.
A good example of this is the &quot;vision quests&quot; of the Plains Indians,
in which a man or woman seeking greater wisdom would, after proper preparation,
spend three days and nights alone in some holy place, seeking a vision.
The full cycle of the experience was not considered complete until that
person returned with their &quot;gift&quot; of insight and shared it with
the band or tribe. As well as I can gather, spending ritual time alone in
nature was a common practice in these cultures. 
</UL>
<BR>
It is easy (and traditional) to either romanticize these cultures as noble
and wise or shun them as brutish and savage. In fact they were (from our
20th century perspective) both. None of these can serve as a true model
for us now. Our situation is too different (hunting and gathering can't
support a population of 4.5 billion), and their lives had limitations that
we need not accept. Yet in this group are examples of time-tested &quot;sustainable
cultures&quot; from which there is much we could learn, especially about
the ways they successfully passed well developed environment protecting
and respecting values on from generation to generation.<B><BR>
<BR>
The Pre-urban Village</B><BR>
<BR>
Historically, the next step beyond the wandering band was the settled band,
or village. While this type of life is closely associated with the development
of agriculture, there were also hunting and gathering groups (especially
coastal fishermen) who were villagers. The transition from wandering between
camps to staying at one camp probably developed gradually, and as you might
expect, there is a lot of similarity between early village cultures and
their wandering kin. Nevertheless, there were changes. 
<UL>
  <LI><I>A step up in size </I>Some villages were as small as bands, but
often they were larger, having as many as a few hundred residents.<BR>
<I><BR>
</I>
  <LI><I>More material wealth </I>As people stayed in one place, they started
to acquire more things, although the nonmaterial, like ritual songs, remained
important. For some groups, the workload was similar to that of the hunters
and gatherers, and no particular surplus was produced. However, where storage
was used, and especially where the practice of giving extravagant feasts
to gain status developed, more was produced and the workload drifted heavier
18 With this, of course, also came some comforts (like better shelter),
and the ability to survive lean times through stored food.<BR>
<I><BR>
</I>
  <LI><I>Initiation becomes more social </I>Especially with a shift in focus
from hunting to agriculture, the re-enactment of the heroic cycle changed.
Instead of the individual alone in nature, we now find the group facing
their crisis in the human setting of the kiva. This is not to say that hunters
and gatherers did not have some group initiations or that villagers did
not have personal ritual trials but as well as I can tell, the emphasis
seems to shift. The value of bonding to the group takes precedence over
the courage to stand alone.<BR>
<I><BR>
</I>
  <LI><I>A greater emphasis on the feminine </I>I use this term with caution,
but the shift from wandering to settled life, and especially to agriculture
involved a corresponding shift in values and experience away from the swift,
explorative, agile strength and exuberance of the hunter to the quieter,
rhythmic, locally focused nurturing of plants, animals, and people. 
</UL>
<B><BR>
The Coming of the Citadel</B><BR>
<BR>
The domestication of plants and animals had a major effect on the role of
the hunter. These new techniques produced considerably more food on the
same amount of land than occurred naturally, and this decreased the importance
of hunting as a food source, domesticated land that had been the home of
wild game, and increased the human population density. The &quot;hunter&quot;
thus had to either become a farmer or herder, or develop a new relationship
with the society. In the transition to agriculture, obviously most became
farmers or herders, but there were a significant few who didn't. Early stories
from Mesopotamia indicate that some hunters developed a specialized role
as protectors for the agricultural villagers, keeping marauding animals
away from children, cattle, and crops [16] How this relationship first developed
isn't clear, but Mumford speculates that in that early cross roads of cultures,
hunting cultures may have come into already agricultural areas, found the
comforts and wealth of the village appealing, but not the daily field work
required to produce these. On the other hand, many tribal groups had some
internal specialization, and as populations increased, this probably grew
more pronounced. In any case, what developed was a pattern of hunters' camps
(often fortified) sprinkled in amongst the agricultural villages. The implications
of having these two different types of communities living as neighbors were
profound. 
<UL>
  <LI><I>The great protection racket begins </I>However the process began,
the hunter soon either became the local chieftain or accentuated that existing
tribal role, and turned his attention from the protection of the villagers
to their exploitation and control. No doubt he continued to fight off wild
beasts (now his competing predators), and offered some protection from the
raids of other warlords, and no doubt tribal loyalties, religious sanctions,
and personal charisma played a role, but the price exacted for these services
was high. In a pattern that has continued during much of the past 8000 years,
a small group of warrior &quot;nobles&quot; came to dominate a larger group
of &quot;their peasants&quot;.<BR>
<I><BR>
</I>
  <LI><I>The villager es second class </I>Of course, there was a lot of
variation in this pattern, with some villages going on much as before, others
genuinely prospering due to the added protection, while some suffered under
great oppression. Yet wherever the citadel appeared (and after it the city),
the villager learned to work harder, to show deference, to be submissive.<BR>
<I><BR>
</I>
  <LI><I>Village ritual shifts from the heroic to fertility As </I>part
of the consciousness of deference, the village mythos no longer encourages
its youth to develop their inner strength. Rites of passage become community
fertility celebrations - feasts -, rather than processes of personal growth.
Those with strong natures had to go beyond the village to find expression.<BR>
<I><BR>
</I>
  <LI><I>The living challenge the authority of the past </I>Tradition is
still powerful, but a important change has come with young chieftains fording
it over village elders. 
</UL>
<BR>
It is easy (from our 20th century perspective) to fall into seeing these
early chieftains as &quot;bad guys&quot;, but I don't mean to make that
kind of historical judgment. My intention, rather, is to emphasize that
the shift to agriculture upset the ancient hunting and gathering balance
by moving in the direction of a more settled, security-oriented existence.
In so doing it neither integrated nor transformed the energy of the hunter,
but merely suppressed and/or avoided it. Such deeply rooted human energies
don't easily disappear, and the result was that before long (in a historical
sense) those energies returned with a vengeance. The lesson I take from
this is that we need to be careful, in attempting to develop a sustainable
culture, to integrate the full range of human nature, and that we need to
be watchful against the easy tendency to avoid or ignore those aspects that
seem to be difficult or unpleasant.<B><BR>
<BR>
The Preindustrial City</B><BR>
<BR>
In spite of its cultural impact, the citadel was still just another type
of village - usually no larger than a few hundred people and often including
many farmers as residents. It was the seed, but it had to grow before it
became that genuinely new pattern of community we call the city. The earliest
cities for which we have archaeological evidence developed about 5,500 years
ago in Mesopotamia - places like Eridu and Ur [19]. These were followed
during the next few thousand years with similar developments in Egypt, India,
the Mediterranean, China, and eventually, Central America. With the exception
of medieval towns in Europe, these early cities developed a theme that has
been played and replayed throughout the world up until the coming of the
industrial urbanism. 
<UL>
  <LI><I>A third step up in size </I>Just as the village grew to be 10 to
20 times the size of the band, so too the early cities seem to have been
about 10 to 20 times the size of a good sized village, that is, they had
a population of around 5,000 to 10,000 [19] - what today we might call a
modest sized town. Of course, in time early cities grew well beyond this
size - Rome is estimated to have had as many as 300,000 - yet still the
scale is small compared to present urban patterns.<BR>
<I><BR>
</I>
  <LI><I>Administrative center </I>These early cities are all based on organization
and exploitation of the surrounding territory, partly through force, partly
through religious and political loyalties, and occasionally through trade.
At the center of the city is the center of political power - usually the
residence of the king (who is also often the high priest) and his supporting
elite of warriors, priests, and scribes. The temples are there, and the
grain, which is the major real wealth, is stored in the temple granaries.
It is from here that the literate elite directs such things as large irrigation
projects and expeditions of conquest. Occasionally, as in Greece and perhaps
the early cities of Sumer, village democracy manages to live on for a while
in the city, but the predominant pattern is one of kingship and hierarchy.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI><I>Distribution center </I>While there is some production within the
city, most of its basic wealth is carried in from the countryside and from
conquest. The elite redistributes this wealth for its own purposes, such
as maintaining armies and artisans. Thus from the beginning, the city has
been the place to go to &quot;get a good job&quot;, or at least to get a
share of the bread and circuses. It is the place where wealth is concentrated
and where surplus can be found.<BR>
<I><BR>
</I>
  <LI><I>Birthplace of many, many new occupations </I>The city both permits
and requires an extensive division of labor. Moving out from the center,
we find the shops and quarters of builders, smiths, jewelers, potters, and
soldiers. Further out come the laborers and farmers. Different areas in
the city came to specialize in particular occupations, often dominated by
particular ethnic groups. Thus the city was subdivided into districts and
neighborhoods.<BR>
<I><BR>
</I>
  <LI><I>Greater material achievements </I>The concentration and coordination
of large groups of people made possible large scale projects, from irrigation
canals to pyramids, and accelerated the pace of innovation. The material
output of society became greater in quantity and diversity. It is easy to
take for granted, but most of humanity's technical, artistic, intellectual,
and social achievements have come through city based cultures.<BR>
<I><BR>
</I>
  <LI><I>Heavier work loads </I>To some extent, this higher output came
through more efficient techniques and tools, such as irrigation and the
plow. Yet much of the increase came from working harder and longer. The
relaxed agricultural villager of the pre-urban era is gradually transformed
into the laborer, struggling from dawn to dusk just to stay alive.<BR>
<I><BR>
</I>
  <LI><I>Permitted life in a human structured environment </I>Villages were
always so small that you were easily aware of the surrounding presence of
nature, but cities, especially as they grew, pushed back that presence.
Before long, it became possible for a city dweller to spend essentially
all of his life inside the city. Nature could become a foreign land, heard
about and glimpsed, but not known through experience. The &quot;real world&quot;
became the city with its buildings, fashions, politics, and people.<BR>
<I><BR>
</I>
  <LI><I>Made human relationships more abstract </I>From the point of view
of the band or the early village, the world had two basic groups of people
- those in the same band or village and &quot;the others&quot; (with whom
there were few dealings). There were different groupings, like clans, but
most of the people that one had to deal with were part of one's own group,
and known as fairly whole people. The coming of the city changed all that
by requiring relationships with people outside of the immediate group, and
through the division of labor, creating many different groups and classes.
Relationships became fragmented and based on role and status.<BR>
<I><BR>
</I>
  <LI><I>Restricted the heroic experience to a small elite </I>The leaders
of cities were expected to be brave, daring, wise, and generally god-like.
They were supposed to be a breed apart, exceptional in every way. To maintain
this claim and their position, they had to 1 ) prove themselves and 2) make
sure the common people didn't develop their own strengths. In the process,
the image of the &quot;heroic&quot; changed, and became more outward, more
like superman. So the monuments and stories praise the great feats and conquests
of the kings, while the peasants and artisans are continually reminded,
both subtly and brutally, that submissiveness and loyalty are the highest
and safest virtues. These values were reflected in religion with the dominance
of male, power-oriented gods.
</UL>
<BR>
The city and the type of society that goes with it have evoked strong reactions,
pro and con, throughout all of its history. It has been the site and the
support for some of the finest of humanity's achievements, and likewise
for some of our most brutal, terrible, and degrading behaviors. Its great
gift has been to open up a whole new range and scale of human activities,
analogous to introducing trees into an ecosystem that had only grasses before.
Its great defect has been that it generally functioned as a parasite to
the world around it.<B><BR>
<BR>
The Civilized Countryside</B><BR>
<BR>
We can't expect to get a clear understanding of the city and civilization
without also considering &quot;the world around it&quot;. Until recently,
much of that world was not under the control of &quot;central authorities&quot;.
Even in Europe and Asia, it took many thousands of years for the &quot;civilized
world&quot; to grow to be anything more than a beachhead in an otherwise
wild territory. What we need to consider here is life in that beachhead,
between the city walls and the wild frontier.
<UL>
  <LI><I>The form varies </I>People of the countryside lived in many different
ways. At some times and in some places, the life was village based with
more or less independent farmers, while other areas were dominated by huge
estates worked by slaves or serfs. Towns (small centers of political control
with some commerce) were sometimes also sprinkled throughout, while in other
situations a military outpost, the citadel again, served the same function.<BR>
<I><BR>
</I>
  <LI><I>The bulk of the population </I>It is easy for us (who live in an
urbanized world and were raised on histories that focused on cities) to
lose sight of the fact that until the coming of industrialization, no society
had more than 20% of its population in cities, and usually only a few percent[19].<BR>
<I><BR>
</I>
  <LI><I>The source of most wealth </I>The wealth of preindustrial civilization
was mostly quite basic: grain, meat and other food stuffs, horses and oxen
for power, wood and stone for building materials, metal for tools and weapons,
and cloth. Not only was the countryside the source of the raw materials,
but it was also the place where much of the rudimentary processing went
on.<BR>
<I><BR>
</I>
  <LI><I>Heavy work load </I>Some civilizations were more efficient at this
than others, but the general goal of the conquering city was to extract
as much wealth as possible from its territory. The people of the countryside,
at the bottom of the power pyramid, bore the brunt of the work load.<BR>
<I><BR>
</I>
  <LI><I>Indrawn, but effected by the outside </I>In self protection and
in keeping with their neolithic traditions, rural communities tended to
do all they could to insulate themselves from the outside world, psychologically
as well as otherwise. Yet they could no longer be a world apart. From taxation
and plunder to tools and religions, the activity of the city was a constant,
though generally unwelcome, factor in their lives.<BR>
<I><BR>
</I>
  <LI><I>Thoroughly second class </I>The patterns that began with the coming
of the citadel now reign in full force. The divisions of class and rank
are so ingrained that it is hard to imagine any other way of life. The peasant
is expected to be submissive, and usually is, and there is no cultural support,
as there was with the vision quest, for the development in common people
of an independent sense of judgment, vision, and selfhood. Thus suppressed,
life in rural communities is often cautious unimaginative, and filled with
petty bickerings. 
</UL>
<BR>
One of the challenges we face in trying to envision &quot;planetary villages&quot;
is that our images of village life are strongly colored by the peasant cultures
of feudal and city- dominated societies. Clearly, we don't want to go down
a road that just leads back to serfdom. We need to ask, what would truly
free and classless village life be like?<B><BR>
<BR>
City, Empire, and Nation</B><BR>
<BR>
I have been describing the preindustrial city as a fairly constant type,
and in many ways it was. Yet there were also important changes with time,
especially in the overall relationships within the society. We began with
the village and its people whose sense of &quot;us&quot; and territory was
very local. This developed into both the citadel and the city, which kept
the sense of &quot;us&quot; local, but expanded their sense of &quot;our&quot;
territory. Those out in the controlled territory did not, for a long time,
identify with their controllers, but as empires grew and became mature,
the ruling elite came to stretch its sense of &quot;home&quot; over the
whole territory.<BR>
<BR>
In post-Roman medieval Europe this change went so far that the ruling elite
was no longer city-based, but was rather a geographically distributed network
of rural warriors. This formed the seed, along with common language and
customs, for the idea of the nation as distinct from the city- empire (like
Rome) or the politically fragmented cultural region (like ancient Greece).
The common people also gradually enlarged the groups they identified with,
but it was not until the last few centuries that nationalism had much strength.
(The rise of nationalism illustrates that people can, in a historically
short time, change their sense of the larger group to which they belong.
The enlargement of &quot;us&quot; to the whole planet may proceed as rapidly.)<B><BR>
<BR>
The Town and Monastery</B><BR>
<BR>
There remain two important preindustrial patterns of community that need
to be considered. As empires grew in size, there had to be a bridge between
the central city and the countryside. Early towns served primarily as administrative
and military outposts and secondarily as trading centers. In large empires,
these provincial &quot;towns&quot; were often good sized cities. Even when
these outposts were themselves ancient, older than the empire that controlled
them, the flow of initiative and leadership was all from the top down, from
the central city to its outpost. Life in these outposts, while slower paced,
was basically like that in the central city.<BR>
<BR>
The major exception to this pattern was the medieval commercial town. The
medieval feudal system, as a rural/citadel based political system, neither
needed the town as an outpost nor permitted the town to grow dominant over
the countryside. Thus the only roles left were commerce and manufacturing.
Since these activities were not central to the politics and life of this
agricultural society, much of the leadership and initiative for building
and guiding these towns came from the townspeople - the merchants and craftsmen.<BR>
<BR>
The second major pattern is the monastery, which develops out of the universal
religions like Buddhism and Christianity. These religions, by being open
to the common people, provided a socially supported avenue for personal
development, for the heroic quest, and they also encouraged fellowship in
that quest. Given the lack of opportunity for personal growth in these civilizations,
it is not surprising that large numbers opted for this religious route.
Those who wanted to devote themselves totally to that quest in the company
of others of like mind formed what were probably the first major intentional
communities. Many were remarkably successful (at least materially), and
some had a strong, positive, stimulative effect on the surrounding society.<BR>
<BR>
Yet these monastic orders were never true alternative cultures because they
did not raise their own children. Instead, they selectively drew in their
membership from the surrounding society. By so doing they avoided having
to deal with the full range of human nature that birth presents us with
and all of the growth stages through which children go. A true culture doesn't
have that option, and because these issues are crucial to an effective culture,
the monastic tradition (in spite of all its successes) is a limited and
misleading model for a humane sustainable culture.<B><BR>
<BR>
The Industrial City</B><BR>
<BR>
Starting about 200 years ago another profound shift took place - first in
Britain, then in Western Europe and North America - that has radically changed
the patterns of community in both the city and the countryside. This shift,
of course, is the industrial revolution, and the modern metropolis is its
most characteristic home.
<UL>
  <LI><I>Based on a new source of wealth </I>The basic strategy of civilization
has always been to find some distributed resource and gather it into the
city. Traditionally, that resource was the agricultural surplus of the countryside.
The industrial revolution didn't change the strategy, but it made mineral
resources, especially fossil fuels, much more important than they had been.
This meant, among other things, that it was now the land itself, rather
than the people working the land, that needed to be conquered and controlled.<BR>
<I><BR>
</I>
  <LI><I>Productive as well as controlling </I>Grain, as it came into the
traditional city, was very close to being directly usable. Iron ore, on
the other hand, requires a great deal of processing before it can be used.
Growing, as it did, out of a European tradition with those medieval towns
in the background, the industrial metropolis was more strongly oriented
towards commerce and manufacturing than the traditional city. This new city
is still oriented towards control, but now banking, advertising, and corporate
decision making have been added to military force. Also, because the political
unit of industrialism is the nation rather than the city, individual cities
do not see themselves as &quot;the center&quot; in the same way traditional
ones did.<BR>
<I><BR>
</I>
  <LI><I>Larger in population and area </I>Traditional cities contained
at most a few hundred thousand people, while many of today's metropolitan
areas contain tens of millions, on the order of 100 times larger. This change
has been made possible by modern transportation and communications. It is
supported by the enormous wealth unlocked through the tapping of fossil
fuels and minerals.<BR>
<I><BR>
</I>
  <LI><I>A larger percent of the total population </I>Even more significant
than the growth of individual cities is the major shift in population from
rural to urban '9. From less than 20%, and often only a few percent, the
urban population of mature industrialized nations now is typically in the
range of 70% to 80%. This change has been driven by both the wealth of the
cities and the mechanization of agriculture.<BR>
<I><BR>
</I>
  <LI><I>Changed land use patterns </I>The city center remains a point of
power, but it is now more commercial power, with banks and corporate headquarters,
rather than religious or political power. At the same time, residential
and work areas are separated, so that the elite who work in the city center
often now live on the city edge. Workers of all types live separate from
their work places, and manufacturing, commercial, and residential areas
are distributed throughout the city like a patchwork quilt. The old occupation
based neighborhood, often combining work and living in the same buildings,
is gone.<BR>
<I><BR>
</I>
  <LI><I>High social and occupational mobility </I>The rapid pace of technological
change has brought with it the need for frequent occupational changes, first
from one generation to the next and then within one lifetime. The result
has been to de-emphasize (but not eliminate) the old inherited occupational
and class systems. With this has come a significant increase in personal
freedom and a decline in the attitude of subservience.<BR>
<I><BR>
</I>
  <LI><I>Fragmented relationships </I>We can classify social relationships
into five major types: a) relative b) co-worker c) friend c) neighbor d)
co-member (in a voluntary organization like a church). In traditional villages
and traditional neighborhoods, often your neighbor or friend was also your
co-worker, co-member, and even your relative - these different roles were
just part of an overall human relationship. In addition, the other members
of your immediate family shared in these relationships. In the modern metropolis,
the situation is just the opposite. While there may be some overlap, often
each type of relationship involves a different group of people, and each
member of the family, especially the different generations, relate to different
groups of people, so that, for example, parents often hardly know the parents
of their children's friends.<BR>
<I><BR>
</I>
  <LI><I>The heroic cycle unfulfilled </I>The increased personal freedom
and opportunity for self development would seem to open the door for a rediscovery
by common people of the heroic, creative cycle that was so important to
the cultural strength of hunting and gathering groups. To some extent this
has happened, but remember that the cycle was not complete until the individual
returned with his or her &quot;gift&quot; and shared it with the community.
Having no unified human scale community to return to, and being raised on
the external &quot;superman&quot; heroic images of civilization, the modern
person has usually turned his or her questing energy towards self-aggrandizement,
turning the resulting uncompleted heroic cycles into an unsatisfying competitive
struggle.
</UL>
<BR>
Although both are called cities, the modern metropolis (and the society
that goes with it) is as different from the pre-industrial city as that
was from the village.<B><BR>
<BR>
The Industrial Countryside</B><BR>
<BR>
From the point of view of an ancient city-state empire, the world was divided
into three zones: the city, the controlled countryside, and the lands beyond
the frontier. This last zone might be land controlled by other empires or
wild areas under no central control. It was available for raids and conquest,
but it was not a reliable source of wealth. Industrial society has three
similar zones: urban areas, the countryside within the national boundaries,
and the rest of the world, but changes in the internal politics of nations,
the importance of commerce, and the ease of transportation and communications
have shifted the relationships among these three. The &quot;internal&quot;
countryside has become, culturally, just an extension of the city. Its people
watch the same TV shows, vote for the same politicians, and are protected
by the same laws. This is not to say that the land is not exploited, but
the people are treated no differently than they would be in the city, which,
in spite of problems, is a lot better than the peasants of a few thousand
years ago. Unfortunately, this doesn't mean that that kind of treatment
has disappeared. It has just moved farther away. It is as if the &quot;city
wall&quot; has expanded to become the national boundary. Yet beyond the
&quot;city wall&quot;, whether it be South America, Afghanistan, or Vietnam;
Poland or the Philippines; violent or quiet, the old exploitation and oppression
that is the heritage of 5,500 years of civilization still goes on.<B><BR>
<BR>
The Non-exploitive Tradition</B><BR>
<BR>
People have sought alternatives to this heritage for a long time. Throughout
this long history there have been bright spots, democratic city-states and
just kings, religious orders and communes, all trying, in one way or another,
to develop and live a life of mutual respect and fairness. Few of these
attempts have been long-lived, and many of them have succumbed to exploiting
some &quot;outgroup&quot; to support their internal experiment. Yet there
have been real successes, and along with the rise in industrialism has come
a growing pressure towards finding a non-exploitative basis for human life.
<UL>
  <LI><I>National revolutions </I>We may not usually think of the French,
American, or Russian Revolutions as attempts at building intentional communities,
yet they most definitely were. During that period in history, face to face
communities in each of these cultures still had a lot of vitality. The &quot;community
problem&quot; was at the national level, and each revolution was a conscious
attempt to establish a new society based on what were perceived as fairer
values. Each has managed to be long-lived, although each has also violated
its own values in the way it has exploited others. Other national and anti-colonial
revolutions have followed a similar pattern.<BR>
<I><BR>
</I>
  <LI><I>The small community </I>Intentional face to face communities also
have a long history that grows stronger during the last two hundred years.
Monastic communities are early examples, and many of the early American
settlements were religious intentional communities. This tradition has continued
in America through the 1 9th century and up to the present day. Elsewhere
in the world are many other examples, from the kibbutzim of Israel to communities
like Auroville in India. While most attempts have not survived more than
a few years, there are nevertheless a large number of communities that have
been both economically and morally successful for many years. These have
usually had some strong internal bond, often religious, and have often had
some sense of a common work or service. Yet even these have had trouble
surviving beyond the first generation or two. Those that have, like the
Amish, tend to have strong and restrictive religious beliefs that make them
unappealing as models for the general culture.
</UL>
<BR>
There is much in this non-exploitive tradition from which we can draw both
inspiration and specific useful information and techniques, yet there is
no example in this tradition of an effective, durable, humane sustainable
culture applicable to our present situation. What we need to build is likely
to be as new as the city was 5,500 years ago or as the industrial metropolis
was 100 years ago.<B><BR>
<BR>
The Challenge For Civilization</B><BR>
<BR>
During its 5,500 years, the pattern of civilization has always been based
on a center and a surrounding territory. With the passage of time the &quot;center&quot;
has grown in size from the city to the nation, and the &quot;territory&quot;
has come to include mineral wealth under the ground as well as surface land,
but the basic pattern remains. In addition, the most vibrant times for the
center have come when its territory was expanding so that new, fresh resources
could be obtained. As long as there was more territory beyond the beachhead
of civilization, the pattern kept working even though specific centers came
and went.<BR>
<BR>
But now this strategy has run into a problem. There is no more geographic
frontier, no more fresh uncivilized lands to conquer, not even any major
areas that have not been explored for mineral wealth. The easy stuff has
all been skimmed. Civilization, or perhaps I should say we, now face a challenge
and a choice. We can either try to maintain the old strategy or develop
a new one. If we want to maintain the old strategy we must either find a
new source of concentratable wealth or we must shrink the &quot;city wall&quot;
so that there are fewer people receiving the benefits of being at the center.
There may be many possible new strategies, but the one that is receiving
the most attention involves placing equal value on the quality of life everywhere
- in effect expanding the &quot;city wall&quot; to include the whole planet
so that there ceases to be the division of center and surroundings.<BR>
<BR>
These options are presently being widely discussed and explored. One good
summary of them is by Gary Coates in his book, <I>The Resettling of America
</I>[2], He divides current images of the future into four directions based
on whether they are optimistic or pessimistic, centralized or decentralized.
The &quot;new source of wealth&quot; option he calls the superindustrial
image (optimistic-centralized). It assumes that we can profitably tap the
&quot;high frontier&quot; of space which is seen as an infinite source of
energy and materials. The &quot;shrunken city wall&quot; option Coates describes
as hyperindustrial (pessimistic-centralized) - a &quot;1984&quot; police
state of gradual decline and general repression. The &quot;expanded city
wall&quot; option he refers to as metaindustrial (optimistic-decentralized).
It would attempt to develop a broadly distributed high quality of life by
making more efficient on-site use of the major forms of distributed wealth:
sunshine, vegetation, and human intelligence. The last option, the preindustrial,
would involve the kind of massive collapse suggested by the <I>Limits To
Growth </I>[14] study and a complete breakdown of the social order.<BR>
<BR>
Of these four, the one that most closely fits the image of a humane sustainable
culture as described in this issue is the metaindustrial option. It assumes
that we are at a major historical turning point, a basic shift in strategy,
and that just as the development of agriculture led (in an historically
short time) to the development of the new social institution of the city,
so too the developments of the past few hundred years are leading us to
the new social institutions of a decentralized planetary culture.<BR>
<BR>
Yet this doesn't mean that the other options have nothing to say to us.
The pessimistic options highlight challenges and dangers we need to guard
against, and the superindustrial option gives form to a powerful human longing.
If we were to ignore or deny it, might we not run the risk of repeating
the pattern of the neolithic village that failed to adequately integrate
the energy of the hunter? These four images of the future, regardless of
their practical accuracy, are powerful mythic images that reflect deeply
held hopes and fears. If we are to build an effective humane sustainable
culture we need to address and transform all the fears and give room for
all the hopes that these images span. In doing this, communities undoubtedly
have an important role to play.<B><BR>
<BR>
The Challenge For Community</B><BR>
<BR>
Just as a well developed, mature ecosystem has organisms of many different
sizes, from microbes to whales, so too an efficient culture needs many different
sizes of human groupings - individual, household, working group, village,
city, region, etc.. In our present industrial society the emphasis has been
on the individual and household at one end and large corporate and governmental
organizations at the other. This has permitted the kind of high mobility
appropriate to a rapidly changing &quot;pioneer&quot; cuIture, but it is
also grossly wasteful of both human and material resources. To overcome
this waste, we need to strengthen the middle levels - what we have here
been calling community. Yet in doing this we need to avoid simply reversing
the present situation and overemphasizing community. Our goal needs to be
balance, not the domination of one level over another. Closely related to
this, we need to somehow avoid the self-centeredness and narrow-mindedness
that have plagued small communities throughout history.<BR>
<BR>
How small communities might be part of and serve a humane sustainable culture
and how these problems might be avoided is the subject of the next section.<BR>

<BR>
WHAT DOES the village scale have to offer that makes it important to a sustainable
culture? To answer this I'll need to begin by clarifying what is meant by
&quot;village scale&quot;. So far we have been loosely referring to the
population of a village as being on the order of a few hundred people. The
general idea is that a village is small enough to be a socially cohesive
unit, but a step larger in size than a household or working team. Christopher
Alexander in his book, <I>A Pattern Language </I>cites anthropological evidence
that effective participatory democratic self-government doesn't work in
groups larger than roughly 1000, and a more workable maximum figure may
be 500. Not surprisingly, this is also the upper range for workable government
assemblies - parliaments, the Senate and House, the UN general assembly,
etc.. At the other end of the range, other anthropological evidence suggest
that the optimum size for a working team is between 8 and 14 people. All
this points to a range of from about 50 to 500 people as being the &quot;village
scale&quot;. My own sense of an optimum size for a village or neighborhood
is a &quot;team of teams&quot; which is on the order of a few hundred people
- right back where we started.<BR>
<BR>
The contributions of this scale of community to a sustainable culture are
personal, social and' economic. The most direct personal benefit is that
it can be a very satisfying human environment to live in. It is small enough
so that you can know everyone else fairly well, have a real voice in whet
the community does, and yet it is large enough to have real diversity, and
offer and accomplish more than you could alone or as a household. It also
encourages the development of certain strengths of character that are important
for a healthy sustainable culture. If it is truly a community, with many
overlapping relationships (co-worker, friend, neighbor, etc.), then it exerts
an important pressure on its members to develop their personal integrity.
If you can't get away with playing one role here and another there, because
it is the same people who see you as, for example, shopkeeper, neighbor
and friend, then you have to learn to be a consistent person. In a related
way, since the feedback loops are shorter in a small community, you can
more quickly learn such timeless wisdom as honesty is the best policy. Of
course this kind of social pressure can go too far, but within limits it
is a very healthy stimulus toward the kind of personal responsibility that
must be at the heart of a humane sustainable culture. In saying this I am
repeating what Chris Roberts and Danaan Parry said earlier about the way
that community life accelerates personal growth. It obviously affects children
as well, and as such it can play an important role in passing values on
from one generation to the next.<BR>
<BR>
The economic benefit is directly related to the high level of trust that
is possible at this scale. Because of this trust people share tools and
resources, thus making more opportunities available to each member at a
much lower cost than if each had to individually own each item. In a sustainable
society where tools and related durable goods are both relatively expensive
and designed for long life, the economic advantages of being part of such
a self-trusting community may be very important. Likewise, people in these
communities often help each other out in a kind of barter without formal
accounting that adds considerably to the effective reserves of each. These
social and economic benefits may well be the &quot;hidden treasure&quot;
(like fossil fuels were for industrialism) that is waiting to be uncovered
by the move toward a decentralized metaindustrial strategy.<BR>
<BR>
Yet the village scale also traditionally has its problems. I would like
to return to three of these areas of concern that were raised in the experience
section: 1) avoiding narrowness and self-centeredness, 2) maintaining vitality
and essential values from generation to generation, and 3) reconciling the
&quot;hunter&quot; and the &quot;nurturer&quot;. Let's look more closely
at each of these in turn.<BR>
<BR>
As an antidote to the first problem, I would suggest experiences that broaden
and those that deepen. Clearly, exposure to a wider world, through electronic
media, through print, and especially through travel, can be a great help
in broadening minds, yet by themselves they don't seem to be enough. To
knowledge we must add wisdom. We need perspective-giving experiences like
the vision quest, a retreat at a religious center, a few days spent hiking
in the mountains, or simply a few moments of quiet reflection. I expect
that a healthy sustainable culture would be supportive of broadening and
deepening experiences as a regular part of life for people of all ages.<BR>
<BR>
I see the second problem as just the long term aspect of the first. Long-lived
cultures, like many hunting and gathering societies, seem to maintain their
vitality by providing each generation with essential broadening and deepening
experiences as it is developing. I would particularly like to stress the
importance of the heroic cycle with its universal pattern of leaving home,
encountering and overcoming some challenge (which is often a metaphor for
the challenge of developing your own personal integrity), and then returning
and settling down with a much deeper appreciation of the starting point.
A humane sustainable culture needs to encourage this kind of experience
- especially for its teenagers and young adults - through travel, through
student exchanges, through apprenticeships, through wilderness travel and
programs like Outward Bound.<BR>
<BR>
For the third question, I'd like to begin by reexamining just what is involved
in what I have been calling &quot;the energy of the hunter&quot;. (The village
itself tends to be a nurture oriented environment, so the challenge of reconciliation
is to find the right role for the hunter in relationship to the village
and the culture as a whole.) The essence of the hunt is not in the killing
of the game, but in the process of the hunt. This has two aspects, one more
physical, the other more mental. The physical side involves the exuberance
of the chase, the delight in exercising one's physical prowess, and the
rhythm of extreme exertion followed by rest and celebration. The mental
side involves exploring and problem solving &quot;on your feet&quot; - using
all your senses and all your cunning in a territory that you at best only
partly know, and doing this for a purpose that you know is important for
you and your community. There are many ways that people can have these experiences
other than hunting, such as sports, some aspects of business, research,
and war. I have a friend who was a Navy pilot in Viet Nam. He eventually
came to oppose the war, but he once told me that he had to admit that flying
combat missions was one of the most totally exhilarating things he had ever
done.<BR>
<BR>
Clearly the energy of the hunter has taken forms that are not appropriate
for a humane sustainable culture, but that does not mean that it doesn't
have an important place in such a culture. To some extent the physical aspect
of this energy can be expressed through sports, but for many people that
is not enough - we want something more &quot;real- life and meaningful&quot;.
What I would suggest is that we need to reconceive especially the mental
aspect as not the hunter but as the quester, the searcher, the explorer.
There are many frontiers of knowledge and spirit waiting to be explored,
but I expect that one of the most important new &quot;forests&quot; through
which the new hunters will roam will be the world of other communities.
The goal won't be game, but information, human connections and resources.
Thus the energy of the hunter will take the form of the networker - traveling
both in space and along the electronic pathways to find and bring back the
missing elements needed to provide a balanced life for the home community,
risking the costs of exploring and knowing that what is sought may not be
found. It is a game we can all play, and at some point in our lives most
of us do. There is much more that needs to be said, explored, tried, and
tested about each of these issues, but the point that I want to emphasize
is that each is more easily dealt with, indeed seems to require, going out
into the world beyond the village. The health and especially the sustainability
of the small community require that it not be isolated from the world around
it, but if it is open, it will in part be shaped by its relationship to
that world. If all of that world is unsympathetic, then it will be very
hard to develop the same kinds of cooperative relationships beyond the village
that exist within it, yet the essence of being a planetary villager is that
the world is not divided into an in- group and an out-group.<BR>
<BR>
The more I reflect on this, the more it seems to me that the real <I>deme
</I>for the new culture, the real seed for the new pattern of community
is not the village but the network of villages. In a living culture, the
interchange between communities and the relationships between them is as
important as the pattern of relationships within a community. How can we
really expect to move towards world peace if we are not actively building
our skills and experience in intercommunity relationships? Of course the
development of individual communities is an important part of this, indeed
the part that requires most of our time and energy - but not all. If we
focus too heavily on the individual community, and especially if we imagine
that <I>by itself </I>it can be a laboratory for the new culture, then we
run the risk of simply repeating the pattern that began with the neolithic
village and has continued right up to some of today's intentional communities.
It is much better to see each community (intentional and otherwise) as a
<I>part </I>of the laboratory and to realize that the juice won't really
start to flow until the parts are connected.<BR>
<BR>
What then might the new pattern of community be like - the next step in
the series of village, city, metropolis? I would suggest, in keeping with
Christopher Alexander's vision, that it will be clusters and networks of
semiautonomous neighborhoods and villages - mostly self- reliant in terms
of food and energy but interconnected in terms of information and cultural
activities. Not that there haven't been clusters and networks in the past,
but our new communications technologies, our new levels of literacy, and
perhaps even changes in values and consciousness, will make these clusters
and networks qualitatively different with new social and cultural patterns
and relationships. For the clusters of villages, I would expect that these
will be predominantly of two levels - &quot;teams of villages&quot; (about
5,000 people), and &quot;villages of villages&quot; (about 100,000 people).
This brings us back to Ron Jorgensen's cities of consciousness but with
an internal structure that is very different from today's fragmented anonymous
urban populations.<BR>
<BR>
Obviously all this will take time to develop. After all, most of the urbanization
that we see around us has been built over the last 50 to 100 years. For
right now it is interesting to note that a number of the older intentional
communities, such as Findhorn, Auroville, the Love Israel Family, and Ananda,
are now developing as archipelagos rather than one big sprawl. It will be
even more interesting to see what develops as these and other communities
and groups build and strengthen broader network relationships with each
other.<BR>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>About This Issue</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by <A HREF="../../PEOPLE/RCGBio.htm">Robert Gilman</I></A></H4>

<P>OUR THEME for this spring issue is economics, but not the kind of economics
that you find in textbooks or in the back pages of newspapers. Those aspects
have their place, but our interest here is with a broader picture and a
new perspective. Why is a new approach needed?</P>

<UL>
  <LI>As a science and especially as a guide to political policy, conventional
  economics - capitalist or marxist - simply isn't working.<BR>
  
  <LI>Even if it were working in the short run, its long term policies, based
  on continual growth and the assumption of inexhaustible resources, do not
  fit with a humane sustainable culture.<BR>
  
  <LI>Equally important, somehow our conventional economic attitudes have
  managed to take one of the most beautiful of human experiences - the way
  we can create, by working with and for each other, a quality of life that
  is so much finer and deeper than what we can create alone - and turned
  this process into something that is all too often cold, distasteful, painful
  and alienating.
</UL>

<P>What is this new perspective? This introduction is hardly the place for
detailed explanations, but we have tried to catch the flavor of it through
the phrase, &quot;economics in an intelligent universe&quot;. What does
the universe have to do with economics? A lot. Economic systems are built
on assumptions about human nature and the way the universe works. Conventional
economics, which got its start about 200 years ago on the British Isles
when that culture was enthusiastically exploring the industrial possibilities
of machinery and was enthralled with the power and simplicity of Newtonian
science, could well be described as economics in a mechanical universe.</P>

<P>In contrast, we are using the word &quot;intelligent&quot; to emphasize
four related factors that seem to be essential ingredients for any successful
new vision of economics.</P>

<P>1 ) Our view of the universe, as developed through the various sciences
during the past 200 years has consistently grown in the direction of a much
more lively, interconnected, and unpredictable universe than the early mechanistic
view expected. From quantum physics to biology, from systems theory to ecology,
from psychology to chemistry, the old &quot;clockwork&quot; images have
given way to much more complex systems full of all sorts of feedback loops
and interconnections. We can hardly expect economics to be any less complex.</P>

<P>2) The new economic and technological frontiers that we are expanding
into are no longer mechanical, but rather electronic and biological. Our
focus has shifted from extensions of muscle power to extensions of brain
power. Information and intelligence are the new key economic factors, the
new wealth.</P>

<P>3) At the same time, many people are exploring their own inner awareness,
their own consciousness, and discovering that here too the universe is much
more interconnected than we might have expected. Of course, this is not
news to the world's major religious and spiritual traditions who have always
held that the universe is much more alive and intelligent than materialists
expect.</P>

<P>4) Perhaps most importantly, we are coming to see ourselves - as human
beings - as much more complex, wonderful and resourceful than conventional
economics gives us credit for. We are increasingly unwilling to squeeze
ourselves into the narrow molds that conventional economic options and attitudes
offer us.</P>

<P>The time is ripe for our economic attitudes and institutions to catch
up to the growth that has occurred in other areas of our culture.</P>

<P>In what follows, we consider these questions first from personal perspectives
and then from more systematic ones. Personal/global, structure/values -
these are like pairs of legs, both sides needed for graceful walking.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>From Dismal Science <BR>
To Joyful Art</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by <A HREF="../../PEOPLE/RCGBio.htm">Robert Gilman</A></I></H4>

<P><I>Thanks to the prediction by Malthus (in 1798) that population growth
would always outpace economic growth, industrial era economics early on
earned the label of &quot;the dismal science&quot;. Even though Malthus's
predictions haven't come to pass (at least not yet), the name has stuck.
It seems somehow to reflect the cloud of unease that so many feel toward
the economic side of their lives. It is a cloud that many of us would like
to shake off, and indeed most of the articles in the preceding section are
stories, at a personal level, of working to rediscover the joys of productive
activity and fruitful exchange. Those various personal solutions are important
and illuminating, but can we carry them further to a more general vision?
How might we reframe our understanding of economics so that it better fits
the full diversity of real economic life and so that it can serve as a useful
policy guide for building a humane sustainable culture? I don't have a quick,
simple answer to that (reader be warned), but I have come across a number
of perspectives and concepts that seem to point in the right direction.
I'd like to share these in this article.</I></P>

<P>IF YOU ARE FOLLOWING the news, you are probably inundated with information
on the challenges facing our economy - from Mexico's debts to the problems
of the farmer, from the vigor of new high tech industries to the ups and
downs of OPEC. I don't want to cover that (all too familiar) ground here,
but rather to step back and attempt to see the deeper issues our economic
system faces. Here too there is a wealth of material to draw on as this
is a very active time for economic critics of almost every political persuasion.
In exploring this, it seems to me that the difficulties our system is facing
include both &quot;classic&quot; problems that have existed in the system
for at least a century, and &quot;new&quot; problems presented by changes
in technology, the environment, and general culture.</P>

<P>To understand these problems, it will help to start with some history.
The most central economic-political issue of the industrial era has been:
Which is a better shaper of economic activity and behavior, the market or
the government? <I>Laissez-faire </I>capitalism represents the pure market
pole, state-run communism represents the pure government pole, and the mixed
economies of Europe and the U.S. fall somewhere in between. The great debate
begins in the 1700's at the dawn of the industrial era. Up to that time,
economics was always subsidiary to politics and/or religion. By that time
in Europe, the age of exploration and colonization had already been underway
for 200 years, industrial activity was just starting to gather momentum,
and the power of the kingly state was high. The tradition of the state was
to intervene heavily in the economy on the argument that only through state
regulation could conflicts between different classes be handled justly and
a favorable balance of trade maintained. The merchants and manufacturers
naturally chafed against these regulations.</P>

<P>It was into this cultural setting that Adam Smith, in 1776, published
his <I>Wealth Of Nations </I>in which he synthesized much of the best economic
thought of the day into a powerful argument against state intervention in
the economy. His basic argument was that the price structure established
by the interplay of supply and demand in an unregulated market was the most
efficient way to get people producing just those things that others wanted,
and that a system of decentralized decision-making in which each producer
is free to run his/her business in whatever way is most profitable for her/him
was the most effective way to harness human motivation into productive activity.
These arguments had a profound impact then and are still influencing us
now. Indeed, to adequately understand our present situation, we need to
dig more deeply into the characteristics of the market.</P>

<P>The pro-market argument assumes that the goal of economic activity is
basically democratic, i.e., to deliver to the <I>public </I>the goods and
services <I>it </I>wants, not build pyramids for the Pharaoh. The market
theorist would argue that the best indication of how strongly people really
want something is how much they are willing to pay for it, and this is reflected
in the market price. Those who want a particular item more than other people
do, will bid up the price and thus shift more of that item their way. On
the cost (supply) side, producers will have to charge enough to meet their
own costs, so the price also reflects the relative difficulty of producing
each item. Run the argument all the way through, and it can be shown (mathematically)
that (in a finite world where choices have to be made), the interplay of
the market is indeed the most efficient way of matching those who are able
to produce with those who are willing to pay.</P>

<P>There are, however, a number of difficulties hidden in this analysis.
The first is that the market is in fact <I>not </I>truly democratic. It
is weighted in favor of those who have more wealth to begin with. The root
of this is that money, like most other things, obeys the &quot;law&quot;
of diminishing returns. That is, the more money you have to spend, the less
precious each dollar is to you. Thus a poor person and a rich person might
each be willing to spend 1% of their monthly spending on a loaf of bread
- indicating an equal relative desire for that item - but the 1% from the
rich will outbid the 1% from the poor every time. Thus the market directs
production and develops efficiency in a way that is weighted for the benefit
of those with more ability to pay.</P>

<P>The second difficulty is that the market is able to directly support
only certain kinds of activity, namely activities that deliver a direct
and obvious benefit to the buyer. There are a great many important and beneficial
activities that don't fall in that category because their benefits are diffuse
and/or long term. Child raising, for example, is crucial to society, and
the quality with which it is done can have a major impact on the quality
of life experienced by the next generation. Yet where, <I>through the mechanism
of the market, </I>are the &quot;willing buyers&quot; lining up to pay for
the next generation's quality of life? In some cultures parents did &quot;invest&quot;
in their children as old-age insurance, but in our society, child raising
is a gift, not an investment, and the plight of all too many children shows
how reluctant that support often is.</P>

<P>In an absolutely pure market system (no other distribution channels),
the only way an individual can obtain anything they don't have is to offer
something they do have in exchange for the desired item. For most people,
the major thing they have to exchange is their time. Anyone whose time is
partially committed to some activity that does not yield immediate marketable
benefits (as in child raising, studying, planting orchards, etc.) is at
a disadvantage because 1) they have less time to market, and 2) the remaining
time they do have is relatively more valuable to them and so they are likely
to be underbid until they are impoverished enough so that their relative
need goes up enough to offset this. Thus in a pure market system, most people
would be discouraged from doing all kinds of things that the society absolutely
depends on, and those who did would tend to be relatively exploited.</P>

<P>Fortunately there has never been such a society. In Adam Smith's day,
goods and services were distributed in a great many ways, not unlike today.
In addition to income from sales and wages in the market- place, there were
also 1 ) redistribution within families (often extended), 2) income from
ownership rights - rents, interest, and dividends, 3) mutual aid in communities,
4) charities, 5) crime, and of course, 6) taxation and government expenditure.
All of the various non-market forms were part of the assumed background,
and indeed if they were all eliminated, neither society nor the market could
function.</P>

<P>These criticisms apply to a &quot;perfect&quot; market, which requires
that each producer is relatively small, all competing products are indistinguishable
(no brand names or advertising), people always act on the basis of a rational
computation of their best economic advantage based on full unbiased information,
and no one uses political power to gain economic advantages. When these
&quot;imperfections&quot; are taken into account, the result is that the
market of the real world favors the wealthier, more powerful producers as
well as the wealthier consumers.</P>

<P>Do these drawbacks of the market mean that it should be abandoned? That
is what Marx thought. Working about three quarters of a century later than
Smith, he was in a different cultural setting. Industrial expansion was
in full swing, and the unpleasant side effects were becoming all too obvious.
Marx argued that free market capitalism, as it was developing at that time,
did not truly decentralize decision-making, but simply shifted it from an
aristocratic to an industrial elite, and that the dynamics of capitalism
were such that wealth (and power) tended to concentrate in the hands of
fewer and fewer industrialists. In order to bring the full benefits of industrial
economic progress to the great majority, he wanted to turn ownership of
industry over to the workers and eliminate the market. The economic system
would then need to be (at least initially) administered by the state.</P>

<P>Marx was really more of a critic than a builder, and much of the development
of applied Marxist economics has come from later followers. As it has developed
in today's communist countries it often begrudgingly includes some market
activity, but the ideal is to have the main aspects of the economy all centrally
planned and run. We all have our various opinions about how well this has
succeeded, but my favorite comes from Eugen Loebl, a Czech who has been
both a political prisoner and a high official (Director of the State Bank)
in that country before he left in 1968. In his book, <I>Humanomics, </I>he
says:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>&quot;We can make two important observations about the experiences of
  the planned economies. First, they have demonstrated that it is possible
  to formulate socioeconomic objectives for an economy based on applied science
  and break these objectives down into target figures for every aspect of
  production. . .</P>
  <P>The second observation that we can make about planned economies is that
  their plans never work.&quot;</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The problem is that the planned approach gets the motivation all wrong
and, by centralizing decision-making, makes abysmal use of the intelligence
of most of the population. Not subject to the quality discipline of the
competitive market, but only required to reach a certain target quantity
of production, all this untapped intelligence devotes itself to meeting
the quotas with as little effort as possible. The result is often oversized
work forces and shoddy output. Attempting to deny the market is at least
as bad as attempting to base everything on it.</P>

<P>Where does this leave us? No wonder economics is referred to as the dismal
science. Seeing the difficulties of both pure market and pure state, the
countries of both Europe and North America have adopted mixed systems of
various sorts, but these too have their problems. In the rest of this article,
I'll focus on the situation in the U.S., but the principles can be applied
more broadly.</P>

<P>(As for economics as a study, there has been considerable mathematical
refinement during the last 100 years or so, but very little conceptual development.
Not that there aren't a few economists, such as Scott Burns, Herman Daly,
and Robert Theobald, who are dealing with the subject from a broader perspective,
but those economists who influence public policy and business are still
conceptually in Adam Smith's world.)</P>

<H4>Our Current Situation</H4>

<P>In our mixed system, the question of whether there is too much or too
little government activity in the economy is the standard issue that most
of our politics revolves around. Yet there are also other &quot;classic&quot;
issues that are affecting the behavior of our system. Below is a diagram
by Shann Turnbull (Australian business consultant and author of <I>Democratizing
The Wealth Of Nations) </I>that gives a view of our current problems in
terms of these classic issues.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../../IMAGES/Turnbull.gif" WIDTH="474" HEIGHT=
"573" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></P>

<P>Turnbull is primarily concerned with how to get a market based system
to function in a way that is generally beneficial - that is indeed democratic.
Implicit in his analysis is the idea that this can happen only when there
is a fairly broad distribution of wealth so that the market has &quot;equal
players&quot;, and that money should be a reliable store of value, free
from manipulation. In the diagram, two items are identified as key causal
factors. Let me now provide more detail on each of these. <BR>
<BR>
Wealth in the form of land and corporations tends to concentrate because
the more you have, the more you can afford to reinvest, thereby generating
still more. The two main &quot;rules of ownership&quot; that accentuate
this concentration are: 1) there are no built-in factors (such as requirements
of use or other involvement) that might tend to limit the amount of land
or corporate equity one person can own, and <BR>
2) there are no built-in factors to limit the life of ownership (such as
the time limits on patent rights or the natural depreciation of most personal
items, buildings, tools, etc.). Thus wealth in this form, once gained, requires
little effort to be retained. Whatever the general merits of these rules,
their result, in capitalist countries throughout the world, is to concentrate
the ownership of productive assets.</P>

<P>The cultural factor that is linked with this is that most people have
little experience in, skill at, or incentive to learn economic management
skills. This in turn makes them tend to play the economic game poorly, thereby
losing more wealth to those who play it well.</P>

<P>The second key factor - monopoly control of the money system - is something
whose importance has been made clearer through the recent worldwide growth
of inflation and the problems of large scale international and corporate
debt. The banking and money system can be used as a subtle but powerful
tool for influencing the economy of a society, as Keynes argued. It can
also be used to transfer wealth from one part of society to another unless
there are effective controls, beyond the reach of the government, including
some effective standard that keeps the value of money steady over time.
At the present time our money system has no such standard, and historically,
monopoly control has always provided an irresistible temptation to use that
power in the interest of the politicians and bankers who control the system.</P>

<P>Neither of these critiques is particularly new. The analysis of the tendency
for wealth to concentrate goes back at least to Ricardo and of course was
a central theme of Marx. It tends to be associated with left-wing critics
of the system. The analysis of the problems caused by monopoly money control
goes back at least 100 years to the populist movement, although in recent
years it has been most developed by right-wing critics of the system. For
me, a major part of the strength of Turnbull's analysis is his ability to
leave the usual ideological feuding behind and show the interaction between
these two problem areas. Not included on this diagram, but also contributing
to the breakdown of the system, are high levels of spending on nonproductive
items such as military hardware. Obviously the system has survived in spite
of these problems, but that does not mean they are not significant. They
are inefficiencies that we can afford to ignore only during times of general
easy affluence.</P>

<P>Yet the current difficulties that economies are facing come from more
than just these classic problems. Robert Theobald lists four non-economic
&quot;driving forces&quot; that are causing broad changes in our economic
life. These are:</P>

  <P><I>1) Technological advances, </I>especially in microelectronics, telecommunications
  and biology. Of major socio-economic importance is the enormous potential
  robotics and computers have for reducing the need for semi-skilled factory
  workers and white collar clerks. Some new highly skilled jobs will be created,
  but in much smaller numbers than those lost. Thus, unlike the past, any
  major new spurt in investment is likely to increase unemployment.</P>
  <P><I>2) The declining availability of energy and raw materials. </I>Now
  that we are starting to bump into the finiteness of non-renewable resources,
  we are also being made aware that our economic system has absolutely no
  mechanism for including the interests of future generations in its calculations.</P>
  <P><I>3) The growing importance of maintaining environmental quality. </I>Another
  vital part of the real economy that our system doesn't include in its accounting
  is the natural environment.</P>
  <P><I>4) Changes in the labor force </I>including the entry of more women
  and the decline in unskilled jobs without a corresponding decline in unskilled
  workers. The number of people who want jobs is growing at the same time
  that technological advances are pressing to greatly reduce the number of
  jobs.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The impact of these on our economic framework is that we must now take
into account new factors that are not directly represented in the market-place
(future generations, the environment), and we will have to reapproach the
whole question of the distribution of work and of goods and services.</P>

<P>In addition to, and in some ways standing above all this is the growing
importance of information in our society. John Naisbitt, in <I>Megatrends,
</I>identifies the following 10 items as the dominant socio-economic trends
going on in the country at this time:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>1) We are in a major shift from an industrial to an information-based
  society.</P>
  <P>2) Every new technology (high tech) introduced is balanced by an increased
  emphasis on personal interaction and community (high touch).</P>
  <P>3) National economies are blending into a global economy.</P>
  <P>4) Corporate decision makers are moving from short term to long term
  planning.</P>
  <P>5) We are shifting from centralization to decentralization.</P>
  <P>6) We are turning away from institutional help to self-help.</P>
  <P>7) Representative democracy is giving way to a greater emphasis on direct
  participatory democracy.</P>
  <P>8) Hierarchies are being replaced by networks.</P>
  <P>9) The focus of economic growth is moving from the North to the South.</P>
  <P>10) We no longer live in an either/or world; people are demanding and
  getting a multitude of options.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>With the possible exception of the move from North to South, each one
of these is an expression of the way in which there is more information
in our society today, we have more access to it, and we are more skilled
at using it.</P>

<P>Subtler than all these items, but woven through them, is the way that
we are changing our sense of what is important in life from things and possessing
to information and experiencing. The Values and Life Style study by Stanford
Research Institute describes the U.S. population as being divided into three
major groups: those who are focused on survival needs (about 10%), those
who are focused on status and approval needs - the &quot;outerdirected&quot;
- (about 60%), and those who are focused on personal growth and experience
needs - the &quot;innerdirected&quot; - (about 30%). The striking thing
about their study, however, was that the percentage in the &quot;innerdirected&quot;
group had grown rapidly during the 1970's and, consistent with Naisbitt's
trends, showed every indication of continuing to grow during the 1980's.
Every one of the articles in the first section reflects this shift. Of course,
in all these trends, the shift does not mean a black and white jump from
one category to another. The coming of industrial society did not mean that
people stopped all agriculture and in the same way, the shift to an information
society does not mean the end of industry. But the balance does shift, and
in ways that have profound affects throughout the culture.</P>

<H4>A Toolbox Of Concepts</H4>

<P>We have come a long way from the cottage industry world of Adam Smith
or the black smokestack world of Karl Marx. As I look at our current situation
and the dismalness of the standard economic systems, I am reminded of one
of my favorite puzzles. In this puzzle the challenge is to take 6 match
sticks and arrange them so that each end of each stick is touching the ends
of two others. People will usually lay the sticks out in front of them and
try all kinds of unsuccessful patterns until they realize that the problem
can't be solved in two dimensions. The solution is very simple when you
get it - a pyramid. Likewise, if we are to adequately deal with our new
complexity we will need to go beyond the limited market-state dimension.
We need a richer vocabulary of models, concepts and options to draw on.
I'd like to suggest the following items as particularly helpful conceptual
tools for going beyond the traditional domain of economics.</P>

<P><B>Spheres of Economic Activity </B>While conventional economics claims
to be (and needs to be) a broad study of the production and distribution
of goods and services, in practice it has focused almost entirely on only
one area (or sphere) of productive activity - namely the &quot;cash&quot;
economy. The productivity within households, the informal economies within
communities, the productivity of ecosystems have all been ignored and/or
taken for granted. The reason sometimes given for ignoring the non-cash
economies is that since there are no prices, there is no objective way to
determine the value of these activities - &quot;since we don't know how
to handle it, we will assume it's unimportant.&quot; Yet this is hardly
a minor oversight. In <I>The Household Economy </I>(still the best introduction
to the economic importance of the non-market economies), Scott Burns shows
that even in our highly cash-economy oriented society, at least 1/3 of all
&quot;income&quot; comes in the direct form of goods and services through
productive activities in the household and community. For most people in
the world, the cash economy accounts for only a small part of their total
economic activity. Nor is this merely an academic problem. The close connection
between economics and politics has meant that because these other &quot;economies&quot;
have been left out of the standard accounting, they have been systematically
undervalued and depleted in the interest of boosting the market economy.
The result of this &quot;oversight&quot; has been devastating in many Third
World countries where well established community economies have been destroyed
as a &quot;side effect&quot; of development programs aimed at boosting the
country's Gross National Product, leaving the country richer on paper but
poorer in fact (see, for example, the following article by Belden Paulson).
The lesson here is that we cannot expect to develop a useful new economics
unless we take into account the household, the community, and the biosphere
as significant spheres of economic activity.</P>

<P><B>Materials, Skills, and Time </B>Economic activity requires inputs.
Economists sometimes divide these into such things as land, capital and
labor, but I find another set of three categories more useful, i.e. material
goods (land, equipment, supplies, etc.), skills (including knowledge) and
time. The special thing about this division is that each type of input is
governed by distinctly different laws. Material goods are all limited in
abundance and normally subject to wear (depreciation and entropy) through
use. They obey an economy of scarcity in the sense that they can only be
in one place at one time, and use by one person or group generally means
that resource or tool is not available for use at the same time by others.
Every apple I eat means one less apple available for someone else. (This
&quot;economy of scarcity&quot; does <I>not </I>mean that someone must always
be left empty-handed, but just that we need to treat our material resources
with care. I think it was Gandhi who put it well by saying, &quot;The earth
has enough for every man's need, but not every man's greed.&quot;)</P>

<P>Skills and knowledge, on the other hand, obey an economy of multiplication.
If I &quot;give&quot; a skill to someone else, I don't thereby lose it.
(In fact, my skill probably grows through the process of teaching it to
another.) There are no physical limits on the amount of skill and knowledge
one can have (and we are obviously still a long way from whatever mental
limits may exist). As for depreciation, skills tend to decline not from
use but from lack of use.</P>

<P>The third input, time, is also different. Unlike the others, it can't
be stored or transferred. It is always limited, yet never wears out. It
is the most democratic resource, and (as discussed in the article &quot;<A
HREF="Gilman3.htm">The Importance of Time</A>&quot;) it is probably the
ultimate limiting resource.</P>

<P><B>The Diversity of Motivations </B>Conventional economics (both as a
formal theory and in business practice) assumes that human desires for economic
goods and services are unlimited, and that we work primarily for external
(outer-directed) reasons, e.g. to get paid so that we can consume. Psychologists
like Abraham Maslow suggest instead that people operate on the basis of
a hierarchy of needs, starting from survival, going up through security,
esteem and love, to self-actualization. The consumption needs of each level
are limited, and when they are truly met, attention tends to shift to the
next level up until one reaches the level of self-actualization which is
a creative need, focused on intrinsic rewards, rather than a deficiency
need. In this model, as one becomes more skilled in satisfying various levels
of needs, one's demand for goods and services may actually decline. Clearly,
the theory of motivation assumed can make a major difference in the type
of economic system developed.</P>

<P>Another useful model for understanding the diversity of human motivation
is the idea of the three levels of the human brain developed by Paul MacLean,
Chief of the Laboratory of Brain Evolution and Behavior at the National
Institute of Mental Health. Physically, our brains are a combination of
a central stem that is very like the brains of reptiles, a second layer
that is like the brains of other mammals, and an outer neo-cortex that is
distinctly human. MacLean suggests that our behavior reflects this physical
organization. The reptilian part is concerned with territory, possessions,
and physical space; the mammalian part is concerned with relationships,
status, and emotions, and the neo-cortex is concerned with synthesis and
creativity. The three brain levels trace out the same hierarchy of needs
as Maslow's model, but this model emphasizes that these needs are not only
with us all the time, but that different parts of the brain can act independently,
even in opposition. In either model, the goal is to meet all the needs in
a coordinated way. If we are to develop a realistic new economic framework,
we need to appreciate this full diversity of motivations not only between
people but within each of us.</P>

<P><B>Modes of Communication and Organization </B>Conventional economics
assumes that there are only two significant forms of communications and
organization: via price in the market-place and via command in a hierarchical
organization. Capitalist economies use both while Marxist economies rely
primarily on hierarchy. Yet as usual, real human behavior is more diverse.
Turnbull, in his economic study of aboriginal society for the Australian
Parliament, found that he had to include two other economically significant
modes: spontaneous communications in small groups, and forms of organization
based on membership/ownership/relationship positions. To these I would add
a fifth type, the network. Each has its strengths, and by having all of
them in our toolbox, we can construct much more appropriate economic systems.</P>

<P><B>Feedback and Time Lags </B>When<B> </B>your action produces a reaction
that affects your next action, you are in a feedback loop. When your action
produces a reaction 10 years from now, you are in a feedback loop with a
time lag. One of the challenges of real life is that our actions often produce
many different reactions with a broad range of time lags. It is all too
easy to respond primarily to the immediate feedback and ignore the long
term, but the results of this can be disastrous. Farming by heavy cropping
without caring for the soil may yield bigger profits now, but destroy the
farm within a few years. On the other hand, short term costs can prevent
us from making positive long term investments. Normal accounting attempts
to include long term effects through such things as depreciation and discounted
cash flow analysis, but rarely does the time line extend beyond 20 years.
Such a system has no way to compare the value of a building that will last
hundreds of years with one that will need to be replaced in 20. And where
in our accounting do we include the cost of cancers that develop twenty
years from now due to today's high levels of air/water/soil pollution? It
is not an easy problem, but one that a sustainable culture has to be able
to deal with.</P>

<P><B>The Tragedy of the Commons </B>The<B> </B>great hopeful vision of
Adam Smith was that the competitive market would turn personal profit seeking
into social good by encouraging production yet protecting buyers from overcharging.
A truly competitive market can function this way, but unfortunately, overpricing
is not the only problem that can come from greed. The following story is
a famous example of how profit seeking and time lags can combine in areas
outside the market to produce major problems.</P>

<P>English villagers, like villagers in many parts of the world, held certain
grazing lands in common. Imagine a village with 10 families, each family
with 10 sheep, and suppose that the commons is at the limit of its sustainable
grazing capacity with these 100 sheep. As long as each family restricts
itself to 10 sheep, all goes well. But suppose one year one farmer expands
to 11 sheep. This 1% addition to the herd may push the commons into overgrazed
condition, but so slightly that in the first year no one will notice. Everyone
else will, however, notice that he has increased his income by 10%. Next
year everybody wants to do the same, but if they do, the impact on the commons
will be disastrous. The commons may take years to recover, during which
time it will support few, if any, sheep.</P>

<P>The air and water around us are obvious parts of our &quot;commons&quot;,
but so too are such things as the vitality and good will in our communities.
If we want to protect these, we may have to restrain some activities by
some means other than the competitive market.</P>

<P><B>Scale and Optimization </B>One of the basic principles in economics
is the law of diminishing returns. For example, adding a fourth player to
a volleyball team that had three makes a big difference; adding a tenth
to nine has less impact. In more precise terms, the basic idea is as follows:
Human activity generally involves the blending together of many inputs.
Some of these inputs are easily <I>varied </I>(e.g. the number of players),
while others are relatively <I>fixed </I>(the size of the court, the one
ball). If one input is relatively low, it will be the <I>limiting factor
</I>and the other inputs will be underutilized. As the limiting factor is
increased up to the point where all the inputs are in optimal balance, the
output of the system will increase approximately in proportion to the increase
in the limiting factor. But beyond the balance point, the variable input
(players) is no longer the limiting factor, and extra amounts of that input
will no longer produce as much increase in output, i.e., the returns on
that input diminish. Thus every activity has an <I>optimal scale </I>determined
by the most limiting fixed input.</P>

<P>The following diagram, showing the general relationship between benefits
and costs for some varying input, takes these ideas a step further.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../../IMAGES/DimRtrns.gif" WIDTH="327" HEIGHT=
"286" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></P>

<P>The benefit curve is a direct expression of diminishing returns. The
cost curve looks different, but it is just &quot;the other side of the coin&quot;
of the same principle. It rises because (usually) the more you want, the
harder it is to get - demand drives the price up. Subtracting costs from
benefits gives the <I>net benefit </I>of that input (dashed line) which
has a maximum at a limited input. Beyond that optimum, more is worse.</P>

<P>While this may all seem obvious and tedious, <I>it is remarkable how
poorly we apply these principles in our current economic system. </I>For
example, let the &quot;input&quot; in the figure be goods and services from
the market-place and let the output we are seeking be quality experience.
Conventional growth economics assumes that more will always be better. This
implies that there are no other inputs to our experience, thereby ignoring
the role of both our own skills and time. Time is especially crucial as
a limiting factor, as is discussed in more detail in the <A HREF="Gilman3.htm">article
about time</A>.</P>

<P>These principles also help to make clear why concentration of wealth
leads to economic inefficiency. A clear example is the distribution of farm
land in Third World countries. Consider an initial situation in which there
are 11 families who have use of a total of 55 acres, but most of this land
is concentrated so that one family works 53 acres and the other ten work
1/5 of an acre each. The small plots are too small to fully utilize the
human energy of the 10 families, while the large piece is too large to be
farmed intensively. If the land were divided so that each had approximately
5 acres to work, the total yield of the land and the utilization of the
human energy available would be much higher. Thus the value of any resource
depends as much on its distribution as on its absolute amount.</P>

<P>On the other hand, these same principles suggest that <I>exact </I>equality
in the distribution of material goods is likewise undesirable and inefficient.
First, people have different interests and abilities, and so different capacities
to utilize any particular resource, and second, the long term health of
the social 'ecosystem' requires diversity. Thus, like most other things,
diversity and inequality have an optimal scale.</P>

<P><B>Game Sums </B>During World War II, mathematicians dealing with questions
of strategy developed an area of study known as game theory. The particular
concept I want to take from this is the idea that an important characteristic
of any game is the total effect it has on all the players. That is, if you
add up all the gains and losses, does playing the game create more gains
(positive sum), a balance of gains and losses (zero sum), or a net loss
(negative sum)? It is a very simple idea, but its importance lies in focusing
attention on the <I>whole </I>game, and that some games (i.e. systems) have
more positive overall results than others.</P>

<H4>Facing The Issues</H4>

<P>It is time now to put some of these pieces together. Our initial goal
was to find a realistic framework for the economics of a sustainable culture.
The ground we have covered so far suggests that the problem with conventional
economic theory is that it is too narrow. Too many significant factors have
been left out. We can begin to build a broader framework by restating the
basic goal we see for economic activity. In conventional economics - capitalist
or Marxist - it is to produce and distribute goods and services as abundantly
and as efficiently as possible. In the economics appropriate to a sustainable
information society it becomes: to sustainably support as high a quality
of human experience as possible, as efficiently as possible. We could rephrase
the first as &quot;maximize efficient market- place activity&quot; and the
second as &quot;sustainably optimize quality of life&quot;. People of Adam
Smith's day would have seen these two as basically the same, except the
first was simpler and more precise. Yet the experience of the past 200 years
makes it all too clear that they are not the same, and whatever difficulties
there may be in defining such things as &quot;quality of life&quot;, we
can't back off from the broad scope this second goal implies and still expect
to develop the kind of whole system understanding we need.</P>

<P>This broader scope raises new issues that are likely to be major economic-political
issues as we shift from an industrial society to an information (hopefully
humane sustainable) one. We will still have the old ones (balance between
market and state, rules of ownership, and control of the money and banking
system), but to these will be added:</P>

<P><B>The right relationship between market, household, and community. </B>As
trivial as it may sound, one of the most important aspects here is the type
of economic statistics that we gather and use. Such things as the GNP measure
only market activity and completely ignore productivity outside the cash
economy in households and communities. If we are going to use statistics
as a basis for policy, we need to develop a whole new set of statistics
that track the productivity in each economic sphere as well as tracking
overall quality of life. When we begin to treat the non-cash economies on
an equal basis with the cash economy, then we can also begin to work out
properly balanced, efficient and supportive relationships among them all.</P>

<P><B>Representing the interests of those without voice. </B>The natural
environment and future generations have no direct voice in either government
or any economic sphere, yet we cannot have a sustainable culture without
paying significant attention to their interests. At the moment, our major
approach to this issue is through special interest groups and the promotion
of government regulations, but is that the best or the only way? What role
does art and ritual have to play? How about public opinion mobilized through
good communications networks and expressed through selective buying?</P>

<P>One of the most promising approaches is that being taken by the land
trust movement. The age-old debate about property rights usually focuses
on the limited question of private vs. state and assumes that ownership
is either black or white - you either have it or you don't. In actual practice
however, &quot;ownership&quot; generally refers to a whole bundle of rights
and they are rarely absolute. By separating these rights, land trusts are
finding ways to maintain many of the normal benefits of private ownership
for user-owners, and at the same time protect the long term interests of
the community, as for example when a conservation land trust holds the development
rights to a piece of farm land. An interesting aspect of this approach is
that the land trust, which supposedly represents the broader interests of
the community, is a non-governmental group. This has both problems and benefits,
but it does add a new dimension to the old private vs. state debate. To
some extent, government regulation will undoubtedly always be necessary,
but it would be dreary indeed if that was our only tool for giving voice
to the hills, trees and great grandchildren.</P>

<P><B>Limits and optimization. </B>In Adam Smith's day, human energy and
technical capacity was (generally) the limiting factor in economic activity,
so there was no need to consider holding back from doing all that was technically
possible. We, however, are much closer to the limits of &quot;the commons&quot;.
We need an economic outlook that can help make optimal use of our limited
resources and help us avoid the temptation to add the 11th sheep. An essential
tool for doing this comes from realizing that of the three types of inputs,
only two of them - material goods and time - are limited. As far as we know,
there is no limit to the growth and refinement of human skill. Thus a major
strategy for an economic system of a sustainable culture is to focus its
growth, not on quantity of goods, but on quality of skill (which is also
what you would expect from an information society).</P>

<P>Let me expand on this a bit. There are three places where skill enters
into economic activity: skill in design, skill in manufacture or implementation,
and skill in use and maintenance. The first two might be called the embodied
skill within an object, organization, or system, while the third is the
immediate human skill that interacts with that embodied skill. They are
like three links of a chain, and the overall efficiency of any economic
activity will be limited by the weakest link. For example, it makes no sense
to build cars that can last for 100 years (technically not difficult) if
people's skill in use and maintenance is so poor that the cars are wrecked
in typically 10 years. As we move to more &quot;long-life&quot; products,
the distributed skill in use (especially in households and communities)
will become an increasingly important part of the intangible wealth of the
society. The new economics needs to develop ways to acknowledge and support
all three skill levels with the proper balance, thereby achieving optimal
use of the limited resources - materials and time.</P>

<P>Indeed, we need to make a much more profound commitment to genuine efficiency
throughout the whole system if we are to have a culture that is both sustainable
and humane. The good news is that in fact our present culture is massively
<I>inefficient </I>in its use of material resources, human energy and talents,
and therefore also time. The progress made in energy conservation (more
rapid than most &quot;experts&quot; expected) indicates just the tip of
the iceberg of our inefficiency. Most of the products we use could be made
to last much, much longer than they now do. While initial costs might be
higher, life cycle cost would be much lower, as would consumption of resources.
(The difficulty, of course, is that total sales volume would also be much
lower.) Rebuilding community is another means through which we can use resources
much more efficiently (as illustrated in Serious's article about the Love
Family).</P>

<P>Yet probably the most profound way we are currently inefficient is through
our belief in the magic of possessions. Through the culture of consumerism,
we have been trained to believe that we can meet psychological needs through
objects and activities whose primary value is their symbolic associations.
This hope that we can buy our way to happiness drives us to levels of consumption
far above what is actually needed for a comfortable and creative existence,
yet the satisfaction we seek eludes us (or is at best temporary). This whole
bubble of drives and hopes rapidly deflates when we discover that there
are in fact effective and much simpler ways to satisfy our needs for security,
esteem, and love through psychological skills and relationships. This discovery
(not really new, but forgotten by our culture for a while) is very much
part of the &quot;megatrend&quot; pattern, and it opens the door to a much
more materially efficient society. Some of the possibilities of this shift
are explored by Duane Elgin in <I>Voluntary Simplicity.</I></P>

<P>All of this, however, will not absolve us of the need and the responsibility
to make some hard decisions about when enough is enough and what is optimum.
While hopefully we can design systems that have as much flexibility and
room for personal freedom as possible, there will be places where the community
will have to insist that &quot;the commons is limited to 100 sheep&quot;.</P>

<P><B>The distribution of work and resources. </B>This is not really a new
issue, but it has been greatly intensified by the trends in our current
situation. As the bonds of family and community have weakened and as wealth
has concentrated, we have come to rely more heavily on market-place jobs
as the primary legitimate means of obtaining goods and services. Because
this is inadequate, we have also turned to more and more government welfare,
but as a society our feelings remain ambiguous about the legitimacy of this.</P>

<P>Thus we find ourselves with the demand for market jobs rising just at
the point when the need for these jobs is declining, and when much of the
work that needs to be done exists outside the market. We will either 1)
attempt to prevent market-place from becoming more efficient for the sake
of providing more jobs (disastrous for sustainability and unlikely to succeed
in the face of international competition), <BR>
2) move in the direction of the &quot;third-worldization&quot; of our society
with larger and larger gaps between the &quot;haves&quot; and &quot;have-nots&quot;
(a system that makes very inefficient use of human and material resources),
or 3) we will need to develop new means of maintaining the flow of goods,
services, and opportunities through the whole social system.</P>

<P>What are the alternatives? There are many. Job sharing, more part-time
work, shorter work weeks, and other forms of reducing the average amount
of time spent in a job all have the advantage of spreading the responsibilities
and pleasures of market-place work as well as spreading access to goods
and services. We can also work to strengthen community and extended family
bonds. In addition, we can make broader use of ownership rights. In his
book, <I>Democratizing The Wealth Of Nations, </I>Turnbull describes a variety
of ways to redesign the rules for owning land and corporations so that these
forms of wealth will spread rather than concentrate. The Mondrag&oacute;n
cooperatives described in a later article provide another major approach
to spreading ownership. Finally, there are many ways (private, governmental,
small group level to international) for directly redistributing buying power.</P>

<P>Clearly, if we <I>wanted </I>to find ways of more broadly and flexibly
distributing both the wealth and the work of the society, we easily could,
but during the industrial era, we have been reluctant to do so. Why should
we, as a society, behave any differently as the information era develops?
Perhaps the simplest way to answer this is to note that the industrial era,
with its focus on material goods and the economy of scarcity, trained people
to see life in terms of zero sum games - if you gain it must mean I lose.
The information era, with its economy of multiplication, will have more
experience with and give more attention to positive sum games - if you gain,
I'll gain too through feedback loops. These new perceptions will get our
minds to appreciate the value of the sharing our hearts have always understood.</P>

<P>That is the general idea, but we can also be more specific. Job sharing
and other forms of shorter work times will grow more popular because, in
our information and experience rich society, our personal time will become
increasingly valuable, and our relative interest in market-place goods and
services will decline (see the <A HREF="Gilman3.htm">article on time</A>).
We will strengthen community as part of the &quot;high touch&quot; trend
- because community will be one of our most effective sources of quality
experience. We will broaden ownership rights as in the Mondrag&oacute;n
cooperatives because intelligence is becoming the leading business asset,
and as the intelligent labor force comes to understand it is in the driver's
seat, it will have no reason to accept anything less than the Mondrag&oacute;n
level of control. As this experience grows and community life strengthens,
we will apply the same principles to land. We will support direct transfers
of buying power to support activities outside the market economy because
we will understand from experience how important these non-market activities
are to health of the society. We will understand that adequately supporting
labors of love is the most efficient way to maximize the amount of positive
creativity in the world around us.</P>

<P>In building these new modes for distributing both work and wealth in
the society, it seems to me that it will be essential for us to understand
that this is not purely an economic problem. Economic distribution is intimately
tied up with questions of legitimacy, status and power. In effect, it is
not the neo-cortex we have to deal with, but the mammalian and especially
the reptilian parts of our brains. These may do us a great service by forcing
us to make these changes in truly balanced ways.</P>

<P>Do these new perspectives indeed move us in the direction of &quot;economics
as a joyful art&quot;? Classical economics came to dismal conclusions because
it assumed that the only &quot;tools&quot; available were the market and
the mores of the time. Marxist economics has shown itself to be even more
dismal through its heavy dependence on hierarchical structures and the state.
I hope this discussion makes it clear that we are no longer bound by these
limitations. We have new concepts, new techniques, and whole new cultural
patterns to work with. We can make use of all kinds of modes of communication
and forms of organization. We can take into account all the different factors
that really contribute to productive activity. We don't have to act in stupid
and self-defeating ways just because the way we did things in the past is
too narrow for the future. Our economics can be as intelligent, as subtle,
as beautiful, as joyful as the universe it reflects.</P>

<P>In doing this, we will always need to combine and balance many diverse
elements including things that may not be easily quantified. We will have
to use our full capacity to value and discriminate, even though we may be
greatly aided by the techniques of mathematics and the information processing
abilities of computers. Thus at its foundation, the charting of our economic
life will remain that kind of fully human process we call an art.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Mondrag&oacute;n: <BR>
The Remarkable Achievement</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by <A HREF="../../PEOPLE/RCGBio.htm">Robert Gilman</A></I></H4>

<P><I>The village and the corporation - they seem like opposite poles, yet
the previous article suggests that at least some corporations are rediscovering
the importance of community and of the village scale. The following article
is about a group of industrious people who have carried this process considerably
further and developed a form of business organization that could well be
the basis for a significantly new economic system.</I></P>

<P>WHAT MAKES NEWS and what makes history are often very different things.
It should then not surprise us that what may be one of the most important
happenings of the last few decades has been going on largely unnoticed in
the Basque region of northern Spain. This &quot;happening&quot; is the development
of the Mondrag&oacute;n Industrial Cooperatives. On the surface it is not
a particularly flashy story, but as the meaning of their achievement sinks
in, it becomes clear that they have pioneered a new social invention that
makes Capitalism, Communism, Socialism, and all the squabbles between these
&quot;isms&quot;, crude, irrelevant and obsolete. It is as if we were still
communicating by pony express, and then discovered that a small region in
northern Spain had been successfully using the phone and radio for more
than 25 years.</P>

<P>What is the Mondrag&oacute;n story, and why is it so important? It has
roots that go back at least into the Spanish Civil War, but we can begin
in 1941 when a young Basque priest, Father Jose Maria Arizmendi came to
Mondrag&oacute;n. Arizmendi, like most Basques, had fought on the losing
republican side. He had been imprisoned as a POW, and after his release,
had entered the church. His bishop had sent him to Mondrag&oacute;n with
the charge of tending to the young, and he began his work by teaching in
the apprentice school of the Union Cerrajera, the main industrial company
in town. He soon found this too limiting, and by 1943 he had opened a technical
training school with the support of the townspeople. In this school, he
provided his students with not only a good technical education, but also
a sophisticated understanding of Catholic Social Doctrine with its emphasis
on cooperation and &quot;the primacy of labor among the factors of production&quot;.</P>

<P>After continuing their education, a number of his students tried, but
without success, to apply his teachings within the traditional companies
where they had found work. By 1954, five of his original 11 decided to form
a new company (ULGOR) where they could implement these teachings, and by
1956, after raising funds from local townspeople, they opened their factory
with 24 worker-members.</P>

<P>Twenty-six years later, in 1982, the Mondrag&oacute;n Cooperative Movement
had 20,000 worker-members, 85 industrial cooperatives (producing everything
from machine tools to refrigerators to electronic equipment), 6 agricultural
cooperatives, 2 service cooperatives, 43 cooperative schools, 14 housing
cooperatives, a large consumer/worker cooperative with over forty stores,
plus four second level cooperatives that provide services to the primary
cooperatives. These four are a bank (Caja Laboral Popular) with 120 branch
offices, a technological research institute (Ikerlan), the League of Education
and Culture (including a Polytechnical College, a Business School and a
Professional College), and a social security and medical cooperative (Lagun-Aro).
During this remarkable growth they have had only one failure - a fishing
cooperative.</P>

<P>To appreciate these statistics, it helps to see them against the usual
success rates for both new small businesses and producer cooperatives in
general, neither of which have been very impressive. For example, in America
80 to 90 percent of new small businesses <I>fail </I>within 5 years. The
situation with producer-cooperatives, which have been tried in various forms
since the middle of the last century, is more complex, but basically most
have either failed through poor management or succeeded as businesses only
to be bought out after a short cooperative life.</P>

<P>What makes the Mondrag&oacute;n movement so effective? It seems to me
that there are three key elements:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>1) The cultural and economic condition of the Basque region;</P>
  <P>2) The specific pattern of rights and responsibilities for worker-members;</P>
  <P>3) The supporting institutions they have developed, particularly their
  bank.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The Basques are a proud, industrious, thrifty, and socially cohesive
people with strong nationalist ambitions. The Spanish Civil War left their
economy devastated and left them politically under the control of a vengeful,
repressive and suspicious central government. These conditions seem to have
been a great help in focusing Basque energy into the Mondrag&oacute;n movement
since it provided a means of rebuilding their economy and expressing the
strength of their community in a way that was not seen as politically threatening.
Whether or not Mondrag&oacute;n type businesses could function as well in
a less socially cohesive setting is currently an unanswered question.</P>

<P>The financial and organizational structure of these cooperatives is,
in significant details, different from many of the less successful British
and American attempts. The essential features of their system are as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>1) All employees and only employees are members, with a one person -
  one vote control of the Board of Directors (all of whom must also be worker-members).</P>
  <P>2) The Board of Directors selects the top management, which then functions
  in a more or less conventional way. However, the general membership also
  independently elects a Watchdog Council to monitor the financial performance
  of the cooperative and a Social Council which deals with a wide range of
  personnel affairs and makes binding decisions on safety, pay scale, and
  social welfare.</P>
  <P>3) All new worker-members must contribute (over two years) around $5000
  to the capital of the cooperative. While this may seem like a large sum,
  it is still only about 10% of the capital cost of creating the new job,
  and it emphasizes the seriousness with which they take their role as owners
  as well as workers.</P>
  <P>4) To insure a sense of equality and solidarity among all the worker-members,
  they restrict the range of highest pay to lowest pay to an effective ratio
  of 4.5 to 1. In practice this means that the lowest paid earn more than
  comparable workers in ordinary companies, while the executives earn less
  than their capitalist peers. Those managers who have grown up within the
  system seem to appreciate the non-monetary rewards, but this rule has so
  far prevented the establishment of a cooperative hospital. (The doctors
  aren't willing to lower their pay scale.)</P>
  <P>5) Only part of the cooperative's earnings are paid out as immediate
  &quot;wages&quot;, while the rest are retained in internal capital accounts
  that are assigned to each worker but available to them only when they retire.
  They have done this in a way that allows each worker to benefit from the
  equity value of his or her ownership, but does not threaten the integrity
  of the cooperative. Unlike ordinary corporate shares, these internal accounts
  cannot be sold and they carry no voting rights.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The second level cooperatives, for example the bank, have a slightly
different structure. As usual, all workers are members, but the other cooperatives
are also considered members. (Unlike credit unions and mutual savings banks,
depositors are not members.) The Board of Directors is made up of representatives
from the other cooperatives (2/3) as well as worker- members of the bank
(1/3). Aside from this broader definition of membership, the internal structure
of the second level cooperatives is similar to that of the others.</P>

<P>The bank has two main divisions, the Banking Division and the Empresarial
Division. The Banking Division provides normal banking service to its 1/2
million customers through 120 branch offices. It also serves as a major
source of new capital for the first level cooperatives. The unique feature
of the bank, however, is the Empresarial Division, whose basic function
is to aid in the creation of new cooperatives and provide management assistance
to the existing ones, especially when they are making any major changes
such as entering a new market or launching a new product. The following
list of departments should give you some idea of the scope that the 116
staff- members of this division cover: Research, Library and Documentation
Center, Agricultural/Food, Industrial Products, Industrial Promotion and
Intervention, Export, Marketing, Productions, Personnel, Administrative-Financial,
Legal, Auditing, Information and Control, Urban Planning, Industrial Building,
and Housing.</P>

<P>The Bank also serves as the hub of the whole Mondrag&oacute;n Cooperative
Movement. Each cooperative runs itself through its own Board of Directors,
but they are all linked to the bank (and each other) through a &quot;Contract
of Association&quot;. This contract grants the cooperative membership rights
in the bank, and spells out the basic principles the cooperative must follow
to be part of the Mondrag&oacute;n movement. There are also special relationships
worked out between cooperatives in related areas so that they can work together
like the divisions of a larger company.</P>

<H4>Discussion</H4>

<P>Time now to step back and look at the significance of all this. What
have they achieved? First, they have made worker-ownership - or as I prefer
to call it, group self-employment - work and work beautifully in a mainstream
business setting. Why is this important? Because it is more efficient as
a means of production, it offers more flexibility to the society, it offers
better working conditions, and it leads to more socially responsible corporate
decision-making. It is a major step in the direction of true participatory
economic democracy. Both corporate-capitalism and Soviet communism assume
that when it comes to economics, people can't (or shouldn't) run their own
lives. The important decisions must be made either by an industrial/financial
elite or by government bureaucrats. Mondrag&oacute;n, by its very existence,
proclaims all that to be nonsense.</P>

<P>At the heart of their approach is a new relationship between capital
and labor, and new rules for corporate ownership. What is the usual relationship?
We often use the word &quot;capitalism&quot; very loosely to refer to some
vague notion of &quot;our system&quot;, but its essential basis is the idea
that labor should be rented while those who have ownership rights to the
equipment (capital) should take the risks and rewards and control the decision
making. If you think about this for a minute, you will see that it is absolutely
backwards in terms of motivation. Given adequate equipment, the performance
of a company depends entirely on the human beings who are actually doing
the work. The quality of performance by a machine is relatively fixed, but
the quality from a human can vary over a wide range from moment to moment.
It is the humans who need to feel the direct feedback through risks/rewards
and the commitment that comes through participation and control.</P>

<P>The Mondrag&oacute;n cooperatives are based on the much more sensible
principle that capital should be rented and labor should have risks, rewards,
and control. To do this, they have reorganized the ownership rights normally
associated with capital and control. Normal corporate shares entitle the
shareholder to 1) voting rights, 2) profit rights, and 3) equity rights
- each in proportion to the amount of shares owned. The Mondrag&oacute;n
approach splits the equity rights off from the other two which become membership
rights. These membership rights can not be bought or sold, and they entitle
each worker-member to one vote and to a proportion of the profits based
on pay-scale, not equity. The members also have equity rights (internal
capital accounts) that are accumulated profits retained in personal accounts
and available when they retire. These accounts earn interest, and are obviously
much larger for old workers than new, but the amount of equity does not
affect the amount of profits earned or voting rights. Thus even from themselves,
the worker-members rent capital and base control and rewards on actual involvement.</P>

<P>(It is this change in the basic ownership structure that, to me, makes
the Mondrag&oacute;n model so much more profound than some of the organizational
changes going on in American businesses. I don't mean to minimize significance
of those changes - they are definitely in the right direction - but I would
see them as incomplete as long as the standard relationship between labor
and capital remains.)</P>

<P>The second thing they have done is to create a total system - a federation
with its own services provided by the second level cooperatives. In fact,
they cover the whole gamut of modern economic activity - heavy industry,
light industry, agriculture, retail distribution, finance, housing, education,
and research. In the last issue of <I>IN CONTEXT, </I>I suggested that the
cutting edge of the new culture was not in the village by itself, but in
the network of villages. When we say &quot;village&quot; we tend to think
in residential terms, but the traditional villages were not suburbs. They
were primarily economic units.</P>

<P>In this light, I find it very interesting that the Mondrag&oacute;n group
has decided that no cooperative should be larger than about 400 to 500 members
- the village scale. This decision grew out of their only strike that took
place in 1974 in their first and largest cooperative, ULGOR with 3,462 members.
What they saw in hindsight was the near impossibility of establishing adequate
communications channels in such a large unit. This helps to emphasize that
the Mondrag&oacute;n system is not just built on a few rules and principles.
It thrives on an active &quot;village culture&quot; within each cooperative.
Yet it thrives even more because they have built a supportive network of
these economic &quot;villages&quot;, and the whole network has a supportive
relationship with its region.</P>

<P>Yet perhaps most important, they have healed the split between labor
and management/ownership, thereby allowing much more balanced and wholistic
decision making. Consider what happens in our system when a plant fails
to produce the profit expected of it. The owners look at the situation purely
in terms of the return on capital, and if they could get a better return
elsewhere, they may well close the plant. The investments the workers have
in their community and all the social costs of the closing do not enter
into the accounting of the relative profitability of keeping the plant open.
<BR>
In the Mondrag&oacute;n system, all these factors are considered. The Mondrag&oacute;n
worker- owners are not sentimental and they will not tolerate a non-performing
business, but when a cooperative runs into trouble, they are willing to
put out the extra effort to find a new and better way. If it means lower
income and lower profits for a while, they - as workers and owners, the
business and the community - are willing to put up with it. They can make
hard choices much more creatively and with more balance than those who are
locked into adversarial roles.</P>

<P>Finally, to all this praise of the Mondrag&oacute;n system I should add
a note of balance. Their model does not cover the full spectrum of business
types, but only certain medium scale businesses. These cooperatives happily
coexist with a large number of small businesses, and it is not clear if
an international airline or a major oil company could be successfully organized
on the basis of a federation of self-governing units with less than 500
members. Perhaps, but there may be yet another way that is better. Even
for the kind of medium sized industrial business that is the normal Mondrag&oacute;n
type, different cultural conditions may make changes in the model appropriate.</P>

<P>The people of Mondrag&oacute;n have been very pragmatic and we should
be no less so. Yet their model stands out as so much more effective than
other attempts at industrial cooperatives that it would be wise to take
their achievement as a starting point. We have a lot to learn from the people
of the Pyrenees.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>The Importance Of Time</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by <A HREF="../../PEOPLE/RCGBio.htm">Robert Gilman</A></I></H4>

<P>OF THE THREE types of input that every activity needs - material goods,
skills, and time - I've come to feel that perhaps the least understood is
time. In conventional economics, it is treated as a commodity (&quot;time
is money&quot;) to be bought and sold at will, and therefore needing no
special consideration. Yet experience suggests that the economics of time
is not quite so simple. The following excepts from <I>The Household Economy
</I>by Scott Burns bring out some of the key issues.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>&quot;We need time. We need time to work, to eat, to sleep, and to accomplish
  all the daily chores of living. We also need time to know and understand
  our mates, our children, and our friends. Most of our relationships, in
  fact, require more time than we have, and it is difficult to avoid the
  feeling that we could never have enough. Nor is our list of demands on
  our time complete. We have ignored the time we need to be alone, a necessary
  but invariably short- changed period. . .</P>
  <P>&quot;All these demands come before the proliferating hardware used
  in the consumption of still more time - before the possession, use, and
  maintenance of automobiles, small and large boats, tennis rackets, skis,
  and golf clubs, sewing machines and looms, bathing suits, hi-fi sets, tape
  decks, cameras, etc. All these things - the inevitable trappings of affluence
  - make still more demands on our ever-diminishing store of time. They are
  responsible for many of the sour notes sounded as affluence becomes more
  general and more disappointing. . .</P>
  <P>&quot;The limit to all of this has been explored by economist Staffan
  Burenstam Linder. If it requires time to produce things, it also requires
  time to maintain and consume them. While this may seem obvious to the harried,
  it is neglected in most economic literature. If we assume that each worker
  has a total of sixteen hours to &quot;spend&quot; and that each hour of
  productive work also requires a half hour of maintenance or personal work
  time (including eating, dressing, washing, etc.) and a half hour of consumption
  time, then we can expect an increasing pressure on our available time if
  we produce an increasing amount of goods in our hours of directly productive
  work. If a new machine doubles the output of goodies, we then will have
  twice as much product for the same amount of work. While this may be a
  delight, it also means that we have twice as much consuming and maintaining
  to do in our &quot;non-work&quot; hours. Thus we become ever more harried
  as our productivity increases.&quot;</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Each of us has only 24 hours a day and no one else can live our lives
for us. This obvious yet profound fact means that time is potentially the
major limiting factor in our personal economies, and therefore in our societal
economies as well. We can explore this further with the help of the benefit/cost
diagram from my <A HREF="Gilman1.htm">previous article</A>:</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../../IMAGES/DimRtrns.gif" WIDTH="327" HEIGHT=
"286" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></P>

<P>How does it apply when the input (running along the bottom) is time spent
in some particular activity, e.g. time spent earning money?</P>

<P>Let's look at the benefit curve first. Assuming a constant $/hr rate
for different working times, the benefit curve simply says: as income increases,
the benefit increases also, but more slowly due to diminishing returns -
just what we would expect. But what about the cost curve? What is the &quot;cost&quot;
of time? Obviously, it is not something we have to pay to someone else;
rather, it is the loss of other options that choosing some particular activity
for that time imposes on us. Our 24 hours is always full. Adding a new activity
always requires dropping or reducing something else. The cost of the time
spent on any given activity is the value to us of what we otherwise would
have been doing with that time.</P>

<P>As we increase the time spent on any one activity (like earning money),
we must give up more and more valuable other activities. Thus the behavior
of the cost curve correctly describes the &quot;cost&quot; of time. The
result is that the net benefit curve for that activity has a maximum at
some limited number of hours. If your actual number of hours spent earning
is less than this optimum, material goods are the limiting input in your
life, while if you are beyond the optimum, you are time-limited.</P>

<P>Next, let's consider the impact of gaining either new skills or new usable
possessions. Both of these make your time more valuable, and thereby raise
the level of the &quot;cost of time&quot; curve. Often, they will also enable
you to make better use of the other material goods you have, allowing you
to maintain your quality of life at a lower level of consumption. The effect
of this on the benefit curve is a little complex. At the low end of the
curve, it makes the curve rise more steeply because you are now getting
more benefit out of the first dollars you earn (stretching each one farther).
However, since you need fewer total dollars to support your quality of life,
the &quot;diminishing returns&quot; bend in the curve sets in sooner at
a lower number of hours worked. The result is that the optimum value of
your net benefit curve moves up (you can get more out of life) and to the
left (if you work fewer hours).</P>

<P>This result is very general. It applies not only to the amount of time
you spend earning money, but also to the time you spend in <I>any </I>activity.
It is affected not only by increases in business productivity (as Burns
describes), but by any new skill or possession - by increases in productivity
in any aspect of our lives. This shifting of the optimum is accelerated
in an information society where learning can spread rapidly, and low-cost
experience-oriented activities, such as running and meditation, are increasingly
competing with more expensive ways of spending personal time. It is unfortunate
that most people do not have much choice in adjusting the number of hours
on the job (it is either zero or full time), so <I>most people are not operating
at their optimum. </I>I don't have any statistics on this, but my impression
is that a great many people are on the time-limited side of their curves.
You are if there are more things you could do and would enjoy doing than
you have time for.</P>

<P>There are situations that can cause your optimum to move in the other
direction. This will happen if your effective hourly rate declines (either
because goods cost more or your wage declines), or if some new goodie on
the market catches your eye and makes your current life seem dull and incomplete
without it (thereby depressing the value of your current activities). Growing
tired of &quot;the same old things&quot; is similarly depressing.</P>

<P>If you are operating beyond the survival level so that many of the needs
you are meeting through the marketplace are basically psychological, then
clearly attitude can play a major role in determining relative values. This
means, among other things, that psychological skills that enable you to
change your attitudes or meet your psychological needs directly can have
a major impact on your quality of life and the position of your optimum.
Likewise, external psychological manipulation (e.g. advertising) can also
push your optimum around. In an economy such as ours, where only a small
percentage of overall activity is directed towards real survival needs,
the position of a person's optimum can be quite volatile - more influenced
by feelings than by external conditions.</P>

<P>If you are on the goods-limited side of the optimum, our society has
clear and obvious advice - get out and work harder. (You might really need
to learn to use your resources more skillfully, but that option isn't as
well promoted.) But if you are time-limited, the conventional wisdom is
not much help. It may suggest that you should pay someone else to do some
of your chores, but that is only of limited help. You can't pay someone
else to have your relationships, or savor your sunsets, and besides, that
can never be a <I>general </I>solution for a whole society. It may suggest
that you manage your time better, but that too works only up to a point.
After you have done all that and you are still time-limited, what next?
The fundamental thing that our conventional wisdom fails to understand is
that operating in a time-limited mode involves significantly different behavior
and attitudes from operating in a goods-limited mode.</P>

<P>It makes one very much aware of limits. Unlike acquiring goods, where
you are not physically limited in the number you can pile up, acquiring
new activities (that may come as a consequence of some new possession) always
requires giving up something else. If you are time-limited, you <I>value
</I>that something else. You are in a position of having to choose between
the good and the better. In this way, it also makes you deal with death,
for you need to choose to let old activities die. Whereas the battle cry
of a goods- limited society is &quot;More&quot;, the goal of a time-limited
society has to be refinement - working to improve the <I>quality </I>that
exists within the fixed boundaries of the 24 hour day.</P>

<P>I can't help but feel that one of the major blockages in our culture
is that we are trying to apply the attitudes and institutions that grew
out of a goods-limited era to a time when (at least within our society)
people are increasingly time-limited. It is not that goods are in absolute
surplus, but they are no longer the primary limiting factor, and they would
be even less so if we had better modes for distributing both work and wealth.
If we understood this shift, we would not be trying to &quot;get the economy
moving again&quot; and create more jobs, we would be working towards more
<I>job- sharing. </I>We would welcome the gradual decline in the amount
of time spent in the market economy as a sign of our economic progress.</P>

<P>We are fortunate that an information society pushes us in the direction
of being time-limited, for this experience may well provide the archetypal
attitudes that are needed for a sustainable culture. An information society
pushes us in this direction because the inevitable consequence of learning
is to become more skilled in living and thus for the value of one's time
to rise. (As Burns indicates, the more our productivity increases, the more
we have to shift our time away from making things to using them.) This experience
provides us with the needed archetypal attitudes because the finiteness
of the 24 hour day is a perfect analog at the personal level for the finiteness
of our earth.</P>

<P>Dealing with refinement and choice in our own lives will teach us how
to steward the planet. And because being time-limited also makes us sometimes
feel &quot;I wish I were three people&quot; (because of all the wonderful
things we could do if we had the time), it gives us a new appreciation for
the preciousness of each human life. &quot;Because I can't do it all, I'm
so glad you are here to do what you do. Through your doing and sharing,
my experience of life is enriched.&quot;</P>

<P>I know many people, myself included, who often feel &quot;time poor&quot;
and who bemoan this limitation. Perhaps this attitude is a great mistake.
Perhaps if we were to embrace the limitations of time, to celebrate them
and explore their implications, we would find that they hold an essential
key to the fundamental attitudes and experiences we will need in a humane
sustainable culture.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>About This Issue</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by <A HREF="../../PEOPLE/RCGBio.htm">Robert Gilman</A></I></H4>

<P>WHAT IS the North American Vision and why does it need rediscovering?
The details of this vision will be developed later, but the basic idea is
that any culture has certain essential myths, issues, symbols and attitudes
that characterize its approach to life and that manage to persist through
many generations and much superficial change. Even deeper than this, when
different cultures occupy the same land area, sometimes they also share
basic visions, and one gets the sense almost of the spirit of the land speaking
through these diverse cultures. When a culture is consciously in touch with
and in tune with its deeper visions, it is like a person who has discovered
his/her own particular calling - it releases a great deal of creative and
integrative energy. While there are dangers in this, it is an essential
step towards full self-actualization.</P>

<P>Why &quot;North American&quot;? Even though most of the specific material
in this issue refers to people and activities associated with the United
States, we wanted to use the broader term to emphasize our focus on culture
and natural geography rather than political divisions.</P>

<P>What does all this have to do with our overarching concern with humane
sustainable culture? Our interest in such a culture is not just abstract
- it is something that we want to develop as a real way of life <I>here
and now. </I>For those of us who live in North America, this means developing
it in the context of this continent, and that context very much includes
the cultural roots that are already here. Does or could the vision of a
humane sustainable culture grow naturally out of these roots? Whatever the
answer, it is something we need to know.</P>

<P>Yet this has not been a particularly fashionable question of late. We
are in a time when, as a society, we have grown disillusioned with the visions
of the past but have not yet found a vision for the future. The initial
inspiration for the theme of this issue came a few years ago (before the
<I>IN CONTEXT </I>project was born) through a conversation with Danaan Parry
of Holy Earth Foundation. At that time, he was giving slide presentations
about cultural change to various groups on the West Coast. In the presentation
were a few slides that dealt with the American Revolution and drew parallels
between then and now. It wasn't the major focus of his talk, but he said
it was the one thing that stuck out as the most uncomfortable for many people
in his audiences. Perhaps it was to be expected in the post-Vietnam, post-Watergate
era, but he was surprised by the weight of negative emotional baggage that
so many seemed to carry about their cultural roots.</P>

<P>If this had been an isolated observation, I might have ascribed it to
some peculiarity of Danaan's presentation, but I knew it was really only
one small symptom of a much larger pattern. During most of the past, North
Americans have had a strong sense of vision and purpose, but during the
last decade or so, much of this sense of vision has faded. Vietnam and Watergate
are the two most obvious symbols of this decline, but it runs deeper than
just these, as indicated by the steady decline of our faith in essentially
all major social institutions - from business to medicine.</P>

<P>Much of this withdrawal of faith has been well justified and I certainly
don't mean to defend discredited institutions. Indeed, there is a lot of
evidence that up to a point this process of withdrawal is a healthy part
of both personal and cultural growth, yet it has its dangers. While the
withdrawal of faith may be well justified in each instance, the cumulative
effect, both personally and as a culture, can be fragmentation, self-hate,
cynicism and immobilization. As the old proverb says, &quot;Where there
is no vision the people perish...&quot;</P>

<P>The key here seems to be that healthy withdrawal is a process of <I>weeding
</I>one's roots, not destroying them, and it leads in due time to a &quot;return&quot;
- a coming home. We learn to distinguish between the deeper vision and the
institutions and slogans that, for a while, have tried to give form to those
visions. We come to understand that our best and most sustainable growth
comes, not by leaving our roots, but by a process of clarification that
enables the vitality that is still there to flow through with all its vigor.
We also come to see that our roots are not rigidly fixed. As we grow, we
can develop roots in new soil and old roots may fade in their importance,
but we come also to appreciate the gradual, organicness of this change,
and how deeply rooted the visions of our culture are within us.</P>

<P>It is in this spirit and with these hopes that we set out now to rediscover
the North American vision.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Continental Themes</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by <A HREF="../../PEOPLE/RCGBio.htm">Robert Gilman</A></I></H4>

<P><BR>
<I>How shall we reconnect with our roots? Our past is so rich and varied
that a few pages can hardly do its content justice. If we had to learn that
content from scratch there would be no hope, but there is another approach.
This section assumes our roots are still alive within us and its intention,
through short summaries and a sampling of specifics, is to help us remember.<BR>
</I></P>

<P>WHEN IT COMES to North American (i.e. U.S. and Canadian) history, most
of us have a &quot;can't see the forest for the trees&quot; problem. We
are so immersed in the results that it is hard to get a perspective. To
help with this, I'd like to start this exploration of our cultural roots
by suggesting what seem to me to be some of the major characteristics and
issues that have shaped North American society.</P>

<H4>MANY ROOTS</H4>

<P>North America has been the meeting ground for cultures from all over
the world - <I>E Pluribus Unum</I>. Whether the image is of a melting pot
or a stew, there is hardly any spot on the planet that has not sent its
representatives, that has not influenced our society. We are in some significant
ways a microcosm of the world. Do we use this opportunity to learn cultural
tolerance, or do we attempt to impose one set of roots as superior to the
rest? Do we try to act as representative of the whole or do we see ourselves
as an island of the elect? The question of how to make &quot;one out of
many&quot; has been a persistent continental challenge.</P>

<H4>INTENTIONALITY AND &quot;THE NEW WORLD&quot;</H4>

<P>On the other hand, there are some important ways in which we are unrepresentative
of the bulk of humankind. With some important exceptions, we (or our close
ancestors) chose to come here, and that represents a major selection effect.
Those who came, did so as individuals, in families, or in small groups -
not as the migration of whole tribes and nations. They left behind people
of identical social and economic standing. What made the difference? Probably
thousands of factors, but those who came were surely characterized by a
belief that it was all right to change, to try to shape your own destiny.
That belief is so familiar to us that it hardly seems worth mentioning -
until you realize that, around the globe, it is probably a minority opinion.
It has made us unusually inventive, unusually concerned about our responsibility
to destiny (since we are conscious of having chosen), and unusually restless.</P>

<P>These characteristics were intensified by the European image of the Americas
as &quot;The New World&quot; - a place of pristine wilderness, a new Eden,
where not only individuals but whole societies could get a new start. Never
mind that the land was already populated by ancient cultures - these were
so well adapted to their environment and so different from anything that
Europeans understood as human society that the Europeans conveniently mistook
them for part of the wilderness.</P>

<H4>LIBERTY, EQUALITY AND COMMUNITY</H4>

<P>Those who came by choice were overwhelmingly from the middle levels of
society. The rich and well established had no reason to come, and the destitute
lacked both the money and the skills to come. Those who did generally hoped
to better their lot in life and carried some animosity towards the limitations
of the class structure they came from. Combining this with the leveling
effect of pioneer living, there was a strong bias towards the development
of a classless society based on voluntary cooperation.</P>

<P>Yet it is one thing to have this bias and to make grand statements about
all men being created equal. It is very different to try to put that into
practice, especially when the cultural habits that you brought with you
from the Old World are full of all kinds of discriminations based on wealth,
sex, race, and religion, as Thomas Jefferson's ownership of slaves so clearly
illustrates. Even deeper than this, even a formally classless society has
to come to grips with the fact that liberty, equality and community are
in a constant state of tension generated by their simultaneous conflict
and interdependence. Absolute liberty destroys equality and community, absolute
equality destroys liberty and community, and absolute community destroys
equality and liberty, yet realistic liberty depends on equality and community
and likewise for the other two. What is the proper balance among these three?
The answer to that has kept changing, but our preoccupation with the question
has been constant.</P>

<H4>THE FRONTIER AND NATURE</H4>

<P>There is perhaps no more powerful continental symbol for the Euro-Americans
than the frontier. It was the point of hope, of freedom, and of unlimited
opportunity. It was the place where the known human world met the wilderness
and was rejuvenated by humanizing that wilderness. It was the quintessence
of &quot;the New World&quot;.</P>

<P>To be properly understood, this needs to be seen against the background
of the pattern of civilization during the past 5500 years. This has always
been based on a hierarchical relationship between &quot;the center&quot;
and &quot;the hinterlands&quot;. The hinterland, and especially the frontier
at its outer edge, could be both a place to be exploited and refuge for
non- conformists, yet its ultimate status was always subservient.</P>

<P>The early colonists carried this cultural orientation with them, either
hoping to gain their fortune and <I>return home </I>(as in the original
Jamestown settlers), or hoping to develop a deviant lifestyle free from
oppression from the center (as in the Pilgrims). Neither of these turned
out to be easy, but the escape went better than the exploitation, in part
because the Atlantic proved to be a significant separator and in part because
North America had no easy gold or other source of quick wealth. Those who
did eventually prosper mostly chose to stay. The result was an understandable
shift in loyalty from the old center to the new home, but with this came
a mythically profound glorification of the virtues of, and identification
with, the frontier. Thus, in keeping with all the other images of newness,
the new goal became the ascendancy of the frontier, with all &quot;centers&quot;
either deprived of power or kept carefully in check.</P>

<P>Of course, living on the frontier usually did not match this romantic
image. Indeed, it was hard, often brutalizing and dehumanizing. Large numbers
of the first colonists died within a year of their arrival, and so did many
frontier men and women in the centuries that followed. The wilderness (and
the native people who were part of it) became a symbol of malevolent power
- an adversary that needed to be conquered. On the other hand, especially
as we became more successful at &quot;conquering&quot; nature, we gradually
came to see how much our mythos needed some wilderness. Without wilderness
there is no frontier and without the vitality of the frontier we are in
danger of being subordinated to some &quot;center&quot;. North Americans
have continued to have an ambiguous but powerful image of our relationship
to nature that has had a major impact on our sense of who we are.</P>

<H4>WHICH TREASURE?</H4>

<P>Another ambiguity that has continued with us has been the tension between
the pursuit of wealth and the pursuit of righteousness and salvation. While
most North Americans over the centuries would claim that they were pursuing
them both, and many of the most influential Protestant religions specifically
linked these two, that did not eliminate the conflict and the tension. Is
&quot;freedom&quot; meant to be primarily economic <I>laissez-faire, </I>or
is it more closely associated with freedom of belief, speech, and lifestyle?
Is it freedom for the strong to be unrestrained in the exercise of their
strength, or freedom for the weak from dominance by the strong? From the
contrasting settlements at Plymouth and Jamestown through the debates of
Hamilton with Jefferson and the Civil War to supply-side economics, it has
been a persistent contentious issue.</P>

<P>Do all these issues taken together add up to the North American Vision?
I don't think so - they are still not deep enough. But they are at least
reflections of that vision as it has influenced the many people from many
roots who now dwell here.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>200 Years of Identity Crises</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by <A HREF="../../PEOPLE/RCGBio.htm">Robert Gilman</A></I></H4>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>&nbsp;</P>

<P>WHEN I THINK of North American visions, I think first of American Indians,
colonists, and the American Revolution. These, after all, are the sources
for much of our mythos, the people we celebrate in holidays and stories.
Yet the process of both creating and interpreting the North American Vision
did not end in 1776, and as I have focused in on this theme I have felt
a growing appreciation for those who came after the revolution. These seemingly
less heroic folk are more like ourselves - faced with, not the glorious
task of birthing a society, but the more prosaic and perhaps more demanding
task of making it work.</P>

<P>What follows could be described as a cultural history of American moods
and self-images in 8 big steps. Alternatively it might be described as the
same thing in 8 gross generalizations, so let me begin with some cautions.
Cultures are diverse, and at any time in history you can find many different
moods and points of view. In this brief review I have tried to focus only
on what seems to have been the dominant tone, especially in terms of the
imprint it left on the culture. The division into periods is also somewhat
artificial, since each period had its precursors and its diehards in other
time periods. Within these limitations, I hope what follows will help to
fill the gap between the formal end to the War For Independence (Treaty
of Paris, September 3, 1783) and now.</P>

<H4>1783-1815</H4>

<P>The period after the War For Independence through the War of 1812 was
dominated by the founding fathers, whose vision for the new nation was a
genteel agrarian republic. The republic part made it radical and unusual
for the time, and their response to victory was cautious, even doubtful.
They saw great dangers in contamination from the old world and, especially,
excessive democracy here at home. They had fought the Revolution in order
to preserve their society, not overturn it, and much of their action and
rhetoric during this period was aimed at saving the nation from the perils
of too much social change.</P>

<P>It was during this time also that significant aspects of the mythos of
the Revolution and the purpose of the nation got enshrined. The Revolution
was seen as a Divine intervention in history, intended to establish a new
political model for the world. The citizens of the new nation were stewards
of a &quot;sacred trust&quot;, expected to transform both history and human
nature. While many doubted, and even despaired, that we could fulfill this
destiny, all agreed with the loftiness of the vision. If the nation could
just survive there might be hope.</P>

<H4>1815-1848</H4>

<P>While the new nation didn't exactly win the War of 1812, they didn't
lose it either, and the dramatic victory of Andrew Jackson at New Orleans
(two weeks <I>after </I>the peace treaty was signed in Ghent) provided a
psychological turning point. The nation had indeed survived, and in the
process, changed. The initiative shifted to the first truly post-revolution
generation, many of whom, like Andrew Jackson and Henry Clay were from the
west.</P>

<P>This new generation stuck to the vision of the Revolution, but shifted
the social context. The new hero was the common man and politics became
unabashedly democratic. The sense of goal changed from refinement of the
old order to expansion (physically westward, but in other ways too) into
a new order. The vision of &quot;manifest destiny&quot; claimed the whole
continent as the rightful territory of the growing nation. Men like Emerson
called for the development of a profoundly new culture (&quot;a new race,
a new religion, a new state, a new literature.&quot;) to fulfill the promise
of the New World. In effect, this generation felt sanctified by its political
institutions, confident that they were working, exhilarated by the magnitude
of the continental opportunity opening before it, and anxious to possess
the wealth that it envisioned.</P>

<H4>1848-1865</H4>

<P>This next period began with the nation's first war of unprovoked aggression
against a friendly non-colonial country - the Mexican War - and ended with
the bloody Civil War. In terms of vision, it was a time of soul searching
and doubt mixed with increasingly hardened attitudes of self- righteousness.
All along during the previous periods there had been a few voices questioning
the moral imbalance of the headlong rush of expansion. In his farewell address,
Washington had warned, &quot;Can it be, that Providence had not connected
the permanent felicity of a Nation with its virtue?&quot;, and later speakers
often referred to this connection between national morality and national
survival. At first most of these expressions of doubt were just sermonizing
and hand wringing in an increasingly melodramatic age, but after 1848, the
idea of the <I>responsibility </I>of national morality became increasingly
important to Americans. The North saw this in terms of slavery and maintaining
the &quot;sacred trust&quot; of the Union, while the South saw it in terms
of state's rights and the &quot;sacred trust&quot; of the liberties guaranteed
by the Constitution, but both saw America's destiny hanging in a moral balance.</P>

<H4>1865-1876</H4>

<P>The Civil War had a major impact on America's self-image. It was more
brutal than any had expected, yet given the worldview of the times this
just heightened its sanctity as an act of moral purification (at least from
the perspective of the North). In <I>American Myth, American Reality, </I>James
Robertson observes: &quot;Out of the memories and explanations of the Civil
War, war became, in the imagery and metaphors of American myth, the ultimate
defense of the nation and the ultimate expression of nationalism. In Lincoln
the emancipator, war leader, frontier hero, and spokesman of charity, freedom
and democracy, is the image of the great and good uses to which American
war is put.&quot; It was with this same image of &quot;holy crusade for
the ideals of American democracy&quot; that World Wars I and II were sanctified,
and it was the failure to live up to that image that so condemned the Vietnam
War.</P>

<P>The Civil war was not only seen as &quot;a new birth of freedom&quot;
and the preservation of the Union. It also marked a turning point in the
symbolic roles of agriculture and industry. Before the war, the national
self-image assumed that we were primarily an agrarian nation with industry
as a supplement. Cities, industry, and transport had all been growing vigorously
during the first half of the 1800's, but by 1860, industry still only supported
a sixth of the population (workers and their families). The war not only
expanded industry, it emphasized its importance and revealed the power of
large scale group effort. The genteel agrarianism from which many of the
founding fathers had come was consigned to the past (the pre-war South being
its last stronghold), the common man agrarianism of the west was seen as
a present reality, but industry became the wave of the future.</P>

<P>The immediate post Civil War years of 1865-1876 were the time when this
new mythology permeated into the American consciousness. Northerners confirmed
their victory over the South through the process of Reconstruction, a process
that managed to leave deep, long term bitterness throughout that region,
but more dramatically, industry leaped forward as the new shaper of American
society.</P>

<H4>1876-1898</H4>

<P>By 1876, reconstruction had run out of steam and the problems of industrialism
were growing more evident. The immediate post Civil War hopes of a new birth
of idealism and morality soon faded in the face of extensive greed, corruption
and violence. In this turbulent environment, the prime contenders for Americans'
self-image were Social Darwinism and Populism.</P>

<P>American Protestantism had a long history of associating wealth with
virtue. During the late 1800's these values were combined with the new theories
of evolution to claim that the accumulation of personal wealth was the goal
of both God and nature for Americans. Those who did not succeed had only
themselves to blame. According to Henry Ward Beecher, a prominent preacher
of the time, &quot;no man suffers from poverty unless it be more than his
fault - unless it be his <I>sin.&quot;</I></P>

<P>While such images appealed to the beneficiaries of industrialism, and
those who hoped to be, they rang hollow for many workers, and especially
for small farmers. During this time period, farmers produced more but earned
less, so they did not take kindly to the suggestion that their losses were
their own fault. The Populist revolt that grew out of this was, at a symbolic
level, an attempt to reaffirm the moral virtues of common man agrarianism,
with its emphasis on equality and community cooperation. In attempting to
adapt these values into the new industrial setting, the Populist platform
called for a graduated income tax, government ownership and operation of
railroads, telephone, and telegraph, the eight-hour working day, secret
ballot in elections, the initiative and referendum, and the direct election
of senators. While the Populist Party never did well outside of the west,
much of their program did eventually get adopted, and William Jennings Bryan,
as a populist Democrat, almost became president in 1896.</P>

<H4>1898-1920</H4>

<P>By the late 1890's, a new synthesis of values emerged, called Progressivism.
It drew elements from both industrial economic individualism and populism,
yet it was, above all, the optimistic creed of the respectable middle class.
It admitted that there were industrial excesses and was willing to regulate
railroads and trusts, but it held fast to most of the assumptions of economic
individualism. It was anxious to promote democratic reforms like direct
primary elections and the elimination of political corruption, but it had
no qualms about suppressing (as Wilson did around World War I) the free
speech of those who challenged Progressive views. It was sure that, thanks
to science, industry, Progressive democracy and Protestant Christianity,
the world could get better and better.</P>

<P>Yet it did not believe this progress would be automatic. It scoffed at
earlier optimism as romantic and naive. Industrialism was not solving its
own problems. Only through careful planning and skillful organizing by well
educated, energetic experts, devoted to democracy and progress, could American
industrialism fulfill its full promise. Progressives favored increasing
the power of the federal government over the states and likewise the power
of the executive branch over the legislative. They felt governmental action
was called for, and they wanted the best and the brightest from the middle
class to provide the leadership. From local governments to the presidency,
they dominated this era and set a tone that has influenced much of the 20th
century.</P>

<H4>1920-1941</H4>

<P>Yet crusades can't maintain their momentum forever. After World War I,
the U.S. (like much of the world) was ready for a rest. Some were disillusioned
by what the war had revealed while others were optimistic that our problems
had indeed been solved. In either case, the drive of the Progressive era
faded. The passage of Prohibition in 1919 was the final major act of Progressive
idealism, and in its wake a new generation undertook to rebel against the
self-righteous paternalism and prudery of the previous era. America had
become a thoroughly industrialized, employee society, and the new goal became
the &quot;American Dream&quot; of consumerism as portrayed in the movies
and advertising.</P>

<P>The crash of 1929 put an end to the light hearted optimism, but did not
change the underlying consumerist orientation of this period. More so than
in previous crises, people were willing to blame the system rather than
themselves and look to the government for help. Roosevelt's New Deal liberalism
was a direct descendant of the Progressive faith in central government,
but the mood was very different. The nation felt it had its hands full with
simply trying to get back to work, and it had no interest in foreign affairs
or moral crusades like Prohibition. For perhaps the first time, the nation
felt a sense of deep, discouraging, persistent failure.</P>

<H4>1941-Present</H4>

<P>World War II pulled America out of the depression both economically and
psychologically. Americans didn't want a new mission, but the world forced
it on them. They responded heroically yet without fanaticism. By the end
of the war Americans had renewed their faith in themselves and in technology,
and strengthened their faith in liberalism. While consumerism remained the
main focus of life, Americans again felt on the forefront of history (as
in the Space Race), willing to engage in social reform (Civil Rights), and
guardians of a sacred trust (leader of the Free World).</P>

<P>This post-war sense of confidence and virtue reached its peak sometime
in the 1960's. During the late 60's and early 70's things like the Vietnam
War, Civil Rights, environmental pollution, the counter culture, Watergate,
and the oil crisis all worked together to undermine the nation's faith in
the liberal worldview. It is hard to really tell while still in the midst
of it, but we seem to have again entered a period of doubt with no particular
sense of national purpose or national identity. If history is any guide
this too will pass.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>The Vision And Its Agenda</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Robert Gilman<BR>
</I></H4>

<P>WHAT <I>IS </I>THE North American vision? How does it apply to our present
situation? What relationship does it have to the vision of a humane sustainable
culture? It is time for me to take my turn at suggesting some answers to
this issue's basic questions.</P>

<P>Let's begin with the vision. In the preceding articles, many aspects
of the vision have been discussed, such as our relationship to the land,
images of progress, patterns of governance, and the role of spirituality
- important issues, yet somehow fragmentary. What weaves them into a whole,
for me at least, is seeing the North American experience as part of the
world-wide transition beyond 5,500 years of &quot;civilization&quot;. Without
quite knowing where we were headed, we have been working at building a &quot;post-civilizational&quot;
society.</P>

<P>To see how this works, consider first that basic to the North American
vision, both for the Indian cultures and later, has been the belief that
<I>self-rule is both possible and desirable. </I>With this has gone the
idea of a fundamental equality between people, and the expectation that
people can and will take significant responsibility both for the direction
of their own lives and for the health of the whole. The vision also assumes
that an empowering, high level balance among freedom, equality and community
is best achieved through self-rule. This has extended to embrace the idea
that religious tolerance and diversity is possible within such a society.</P>

<P>These are all optimistic statements about what human beings can and will
do. For some, this has been a belief in the (at least potential) goodness
of human nature. For others, it reflected a belief that, while the original
nature was &quot;sinful&quot;, through redemption and a proper spiritual
orientation, such a self-ruled society was possible. Such optimism was not
easily supported by looking at history, but was based on the vision that
a &quot;new order of the ages&quot;, a truly new world, was possible, and
that we could and should build such a society here on this continent.</P>

<P>To see how this relates to the idea of a post-civilizational society,
we need to be aware of the characteristics of civilization. While we may
associate the word &quot;civilization&quot; with refinement and order, these
are only superficial aspects. The root meaning is &quot;city based&quot;,
and at the heart of civilization as a social system has always been the
idea of dominance and hierarchy - of the nobility over the peasants, of
the capital city over the surrounding territory, of the priests over the
people, of the mother country over the empire, of the center over the periphery.
Every major civilization has followed this pattern and used it to justify
the exploitation of the mass by the elite, of the outsiders by the insiders.
Of course, domination, by itself, was not the goal. Those at the top simply
wanted what essentially all humans want - to live their lives as fully and
comfortably as possible. Yet it was assumed (with partial justification
in that cultural setting) that for some to be fulfilled, others must be
exploited.</P>

<P>In contrast, the vision of a post-civilizational society denies the need
for dominance. It is the vision of free and equal people working together
through voluntary cooperation and federation - where the &quot;center&quot;
is everywhere and there are no outsiders. It assumes that the kind of empowering
balance among freedom, equality and community that has at times existed
in small groups is possible also on a larger scale, and that the fulfillment
of each is <I>enhanced </I>by the fulfillment of all. It's direction is
towards as little hierarchy as possible. In its spiritual side, it is the
vision of &quot;all things equal in the sight of God&quot; and therefore
all things sacred.</P>

<P>In its major outline, this is just a rephrasing of the North American
vision. In particular I would emphasize that the North American belief in
self-rule denies the <I>foundation </I>on which the old forms of civilization
are based, and make it inescapably a post-civilizational vision.</P>

<P>If this interpretation is correct, then the North American vision is
also a vision of a humane sustainable culture. The humane side is obvious
enough. As for sustainability, even though today's ecological concerns did
not get much attention in the past, the persistent North American focus
on the future and on building a new order that would <I>endure </I>reflect
a deep commitment to sustainability. (In saying this, I want to carefully
emphasize that the North American vision has no monopoly on the more general
goal of a humane sustainable culture. We are hardly the only ones who have
been working towards this vision. Indeed, it would be rather self-contradictory
for us to see ourselves as the &quot;chosen ones&quot; working to grow beyond
the dominance of chosen ones. If we are chosen, it is to play one role while
others play another role, not to be the crucial player while others are
insignificant.)</P>

<P>As a society we have, of course, not completely lived up to this vision,
and many North Americans (from Alexander Hamilton through the Civil War
to ERA opponents today) have not embraced it fully. Still, it is consistent
with the visions of most Native American cultures, it is certainly consistent
with the Jeffersonian tradition, and we have, indeed, generally moved toward
it.</P>

<P>If this is the vision, how shall we use it? Visions are tricky things.
They can give a powerful sense of direction and purpose, yet for the same
reason, people can get carried away with and by them. In that sense, a vision
makes a better co-pilot than driver. I'm enough of a pragmatist to say:
&quot;Let's test this vision by applying it to our present situation to
see if the directions it points towards are indeed the directions we want
to go.&quot;</P>

<P>How does this vision apply to us today? What issues and directions does
it highlight? I'd like to begin to answer this by briefly reviewing the
situation we find ourselves in. We are, first, confronted by an array of
serious world-wide crises. The list is all too familiar to most of us, and
I would here just group them under five primary headings: <B>the plight
of the desperate and displaced, </B>the human crisis that is described so
well in the excerpt from <I>Conversations With John </I>at the beginning
of this section; <B>the strained environment, </B>from the depletion of
natural resources to the extinction of species and all the many other facets
of the environmental crisis; <B>the arms race, </B>which at best is draining
the economic vitality of nations all over the globe; <B>declining faith
in and effectiveness of major social institutions, </B>such as government,
big business, banking, medicine, law, and education; and the paradoxical
problem of <B>the challenge of our ever growing productivity, </B>the socio-economic
crisis. This last crisis is the least familiar and could perhaps stand some
explanation. You would think that our growing productivity (about to take
a quantum leap through the spread of microelectronics) would be a blessing
rather than a crisis, and indeed it ought to be. The problem is, however,
that if we were to be as efficient as we easily could be, we would eliminate
far more jobs than we would create. The steadily rising levels of baseline
unemployment during the last decade or so are just the iceberg's tip. The
net result is that we must either choose to be knowingly inefficient (further
straining the environment plus being hard to implement in a free society),
choose to restrict the benefits of our productivity to fewer and fewer people
(thus accelerating the human crisis and deserting our vision), or develop
significantly new ways to distribute both work and buying power within the
society. It is the desire to avoid facing this third option that turns our
growing productivity into a crisis. Looking at all these crises, it is clear
that our past successes as a society do not at all assure us of continued
success.</P>

<P>Yet even if these crises were to magically vanish, I think we might still
be drawn to look at the next steps suggested by the North American vision.
The crises are only the &quot;stick&quot;, and I know in my own life it
is the &quot;carrot&quot; that is much more important. Our successes as
a society are incomplete. Even those who seem to have all the advantages
are hardly living up to the fullness of their human capacity. Do we really
think that our current society is the ultimate in human culture? Are our
hearts not touched by the times with family, with friends, with nature,
and with our own creative resources when we glimpse the spirit of love and
of adventure smiling through the mists of our grey routines and revealing
how deep life really is? I confess that my heart is so touched.</P>

<P>So then, what does this vision suggest about how we can respond to both
heal the crises and deepen the joys? As the vision's agenda for our next
steps, I would suggest three broad areas: removing the vestiges of &quot;feudal
privilege&quot;, integrating our new relationship with nature, and moving
boldly into the post-industrial age.</P>

<H4>REMOVING THE VESTIGES OF &quot;FEUDAL PRIVILEGE&quot;</H4>

<P>The old pattern of civilization was built on fixed roles and hierarchies
of classes. Those in the upper classes had special privileges - what I am
calling feudal privileges - that were an institutionalized part of their
rank and were enforced by the power of the society. We like to think of
these as a thing of the past, yet, dressed in new forms, feudal privilege
is still very much a part of our society.</P>

<P>On the other hand, a high degree of interpersonal equality, at least
in terms of rights and privileges, is basic to the vision of a post-civilizational
society for both moral and practical reasons. The moral reasons are familiar
and obvious enough. The practical reason is basically that a modern technological
society needs to make the most of the intelligence and creativity of its
members. Hierarchical systems with their fixed roles are notoriously poor
at doing this. This suggests that if we are to move towards such a society,
we need to continue the centuries old North American tradition of becoming
aware of the forms of institutionalized privilege within our culture, and
work to replace them with patterns that make better use of our full human
talents.</P>

<P>What then are the forms of feudal privilege that need our attention?
The familiar human rights issues of institutionalized discrimination based
on race, sex, creed, etc. are certainly examples that need continued work,
but I expect that the standard legislative approaches to these problems
will continue to have diminishing returns unless we are also willing to
deal directly with those forms of feudal privilege that affect all of us,
namely bureaucratic privilege, certain types of ownership privileges, and
the privileges of certain regulated professions.</P>

<P>Feudal privilege is at the very heart of bureaucracies. They are <I>designed
</I>as institutionalized hierarchies. They are built on the assumptions
that communication is difficult and that knowledge and authority are relatively
scarce. Their goal is to exercise this authority over as wide a domain as
possible through simple and restricted communications channels, primarily
from the top down. In a society with easy means of communications, widespread
knowledge, and widespread capacity to use these, bureaucracies become clumsy
behemoths compared to networks and other less rigid forms of organization.
Their one remaining strength is that they can be centrally controlled.</P>

<P>Ownership privileges are more complex, since there are certain aspects
of private ownership that are essential to personal independence and the
freedom from coercive control. Yet on the other hand, the absentee ownership
and landlordism that gave one person the power to control others were at
the heart of feudal society. The modern shareholder corporation is the inheritor
of this tradition, and illustrates the feudalism of both bureaucracy and
absentee ownership. Those who are most affected by the corporation, namely
the employees, have little or no control of its direction. In practice the
control rests with a small, self-selected board of directors who, in a number
of cases, have more concentrated power than the kings of old. Indeed, the
modern corporation is probably the most important &quot;feudal&quot; institution
in our society today.</P>

<P>Fortunately there are effective democratic alternatives, as illustrated
by the Mondragon Cooperatives described in the last issue of <I>IN CONTEXT
</I>(page 44). We can take a major step towards getting our society back
onto its democratic track by <I>encouraging the changeover of corporate
North America from its present patterns of ownership and control to something
like the Mondragon model. </I>I realize that is a radical, and perhaps even
scary, thing to say, but as I read the vision, in the long run it can no
more condone the autocratic large corporation than it could condone limiting
voting rights to propertied white males.</P>

<P>Furthermore, to fully understand what is being said here, you need to
understand the principles behind the Mondragon system. These very successful
businesses combine non-governmental democratic control (one worker/one vote,
and only active worker- members can vote) with individual equity and profit
rights in a way that avoids the feudalism of either the private corporation
or the state. Personal ownership of any sized amount of cash or loan notes
is in no way discouraged. The only major restriction is that you can not
use your cash to buy continuing managerial control over the life and work
of others. That is hardly any more radical than saying you can't buy the
mayoralty of a town.</P>

<P>To facilitate this changeover, there are some legislative changes that
would be helpful such as the recent Massachusetts law that gives special
recognition to Mondragon type cooperatives (see page 52 in last issue),
but the primary needs are not legislative. The major work is in areas like
training, capitalization, and publicity to make this option more widely
known. Mondragon type cooperatives have a strong enough competitive edge
over conventional corporations, that once the ball got rolling, the changeover
might even occur through the simple obsolescence of the old form. In time
some more clearly political issues and battles might emerge, but right now
we are being held back in large part by our own ignorance and lack of vision.</P>

<P>The conventional corporation is not the only example of a modern feudal
institution. Large governmental bureaucracies can be just as bad, not only
for the people who work in them, but also for the society they are supposed
to serve. While this is true here in North America, it can be even worse.
The world has all too many examples where cultures have tried to curb the
arbitrary power of corporations by replacing the private bureaucracy with
a governmental one, only to discover that they had simply replaced one form
of feudalism for another.</P>

<P>In dealing with today's governmental bureaucratic feudalism, it is helpful
to be aware of our heritage from Progressivism. Starting around the turn
of the century, Progressives (and their heirs) worked at reforms to help
the society adjust to the impacts of industrialism (see page 11). Their
approach was to increase the power of the central government in response
to the growing centralized power of industry. They were knights on white
horses, offering to champion the weak, but at the unnoticed cost of further
entrenching the society's turn away from its democratic vision. If we now
deal with the original problem by changing industry into a decentralized
Mondragon type institution, we will then be in a position to rethink much
of the feudalization of government that has gone on under the banners of
these well intentioned crusaders.</P>

<P>There are many strategies for reducing the undemocratic character of
these bureaucracies of which three examples are 1 ) decentralization, 2)
rotation of personnel, and 3) alternatives to regulation. The goal of decentralization
is to get decision making as close as possible to those who have to implement
and live with those decisions. Rotation of personnel means turning as many
government jobs as possible into &quot;citizen tours of duty&quot; of limited
duration rather than making them career positions. This keeps these job
holders more representative of the general population, and will be more
in tune with the multi-career working life that is likely to be the normal
pattern in the near future. As for regulations, these are a &quot;top down&quot;
strategy that, like bureaucracies, assumes that communications is difficult
and knowledge is scarce - a small group of experts must decide &quot;the
right way&quot; and then require everyone to follow. In a knowledge and
communications rich society, there are often other ways to encourage the
same ends, such as the use of multiple levels of guidelines and the use
of public communications to pressure adherence to these guidelines. Building
codes illustrate this distinction. In many areas of the United States, uniform
building codes require owner- builders to follow styles and procedures designed
for commercial builders, thereby preventing owner-builders from taking full
advantage of their own particular opportunities. In some areas, however,
special owner- builder classifications allow these builders much greater
freedom. The trade off is that the fact of being built under this looser
standard is recorded on the property deed so that subsequent buyers are
warned. In this way, guidelines combined with appropriate communications
replaces rigid regulation.</P>

<P>The third major form of feudal privilege in our society goes with the
regulated professions such as medicine, education, and law. These professions
have monopolies in major areas of human life - monopolies that are maintained
by the power of the state and that restrict the diversity within the society.
Here again we have the old pattern that decisions must be made by an expert
few and imposed on the mass. In contrast, it is part of the North American
vision that people can make their own judgments and take responsibility
for their own lives. To see how this could work in a knowledge and communications
rich society, let's take the example of medicine. In such a society, certification
should be legally required only for providers of emergency care (in an emergency,
information is still scarce). In all other situations, the prospective patient
always has the opportunity to check up on the qualifications and reputation
of anyone offering their services. Professional groups might very well have
certification programs, and these might carry considerable weight with the
public, but there is no need to outlaw others from also offering their services.
In addition, patients should be able to <I>choose </I>to assume the risk
of their choice of helpers, thereby saving the current extravagant waste
of malpractice costs. Those who felt the need of this kind of insurance
against their own bad judgment should still be able to have it, but the
burden of this cost need not be forced on everyone. Similar considerations
apply to many of the other regulated professions.</P>

<H4>INTEGRATING OUR NEW RELATIONSHIP WITH NATURE</H4>

<P>The next major area where the North American vision focuses our attention
is on our relationship to nature. This is important for the vision because
nature, especially in the form of wilderness, is the ultimate periphery
- the opposite pole from the &quot;center&quot;. The old worldview saw it
as both the great opponent and the ultimate exploitable outsider. We will
not have thoroughly made the transition to the new worldview until this
gap is bridged, both in feeling and in practice.</P>

<P>Wilderness and the frontier have always been important North American
themes, but in recent years our sense of relationship to these two, both
as realities and symbols, has gone through a profound change. We have found
that, like so many other hierarchical relationships, the idea of humans
dominating over nature leads to the harming of both nature and humanity,
and if we want to prosper, we will need to develop a cooperative relationship.</P>

<P>There are many facets and ramifications that come with this new (at least
to Euro-Americans) perception of humans as a part of nature. The previous
articles on bioregionalism, becoming native, and developing a sense of place
all explore this new perspective. It is also connected to a greater acceptance
of the &quot;wilderness within&quot; - our intuitions, our imagery, all
the various nonanalytic aspects of our consciousness associated with the
right hemisphere of the brain. Likewise ecology is starting to replace Newtonian
physics as the dominant metaphor for understanding social systems. We used
to look for the primary cause, the &quot;mainspring&quot; that drove the
system - with prime candidates being such things as religion, government,
and economics. Now we are more likely to look at the whole system as an
interconnected web of feedback loops with no part of the culture clearly
dominant over the rest.</P>

<P>The challenge now is to take these new attitudes and get them integrated
into our activities, institutions and our daily lives. It is indeed time
for North American society to become a native culture - to sink roots and
build a much deeper relationship with the land, At an awareness level, this
means getting to know where you are - its natural history, human history
and current community. In practical terms, it means developing long term
approaches to agriculture and land care, such as permaculture. It also means
developing the social and economic institutions that can be supportive of
people choosing to stay in one place for a long time - what the poet Gary
Snyder calls reinhabiting the land. As much as anything, it means working
(on your attitudes as well as your surroundings) towards making where you
are, where you want to be.</P>

<H4>MOVING BOLDLY INTO THE POST-INDUSTRIAL AGE</H4>

<P>The two previous topics are like the tidying up of unfinished business
- the correction of aberrations even from the perspective of the past -
but there is more on the agenda than just completing &quot;old business&quot;.
The industrial era is rapidly being supersede by a new age of some sort
that has not yet found a commonly accepted name. It is sometimes called
the post-industrial age, the information age, Toffler calls it the Third
Wave, and Paul Hawken refers to it as the informative economy. Whatever
we call it, it is likely to be characterized by 1) a relative abundance
of information, and the means to move and use it, and 2) a relative scarcity
of physical raw materials. Its challenge will be to maximize quality of
life while minimizing the throughput of materials, and to do so by making
good use of all its information and intelligence assets. This new age is
developing in the context of the crises listed at the beginning of this
article, and it will need somehow to deal with all of them.</P>

<P>What perspective does the North American vision bring to this emerging
age and its challenges? If that vision is truly a post-civilizational vision,
then it transcends the specifics of its agrarian and industrial forms. Indeed,
it encourages us to be inventive - to freely create new institutions and
cultural patterns that can take advantage of the opportunities of this emerging
age to enhance the fundamental qualities of freedom, equality, and community.</P>

<P>Yet we have no guarantee that this emerging age will enhance these qualities.
In summarizing various images of the future, Gary Coates in <I>The Resettling
Of America </I>(see page<I>39, IN CONTEXT </I>Winter 1983<I>) </I>suggests
four main possibilities: the superindustrial, the hyperindustrial, the preindustrial,
and the metaindustrial. Of these, the first two move towards empire and
the old patterns of hierarchy, and the third is an image of chaos and collapse.
Only the last continues to develop the goals of the North American vision.
Thus we need to move boldly into this emerging age - shaping it with the
help of the vision and in turn rediscovering the vision in the new conditions
and opportunities opening to us.</P>

<P>How does all this relate to the crises we are facing? I would suggest
that two of these - our growing productivity and the arms race - are kingpins,
and the way we deal with these will have a major impact on the others.</P>

<P>If we really felt free to develop the full material efficiency of which
we are capable as a society - through readily available improvements in
goods, services, and the ways we distribute these - we could substantially
reduce our impact on the environment, offer a realistic and appealing high
quality lifestyle that would not destroy the planet if it were shared by
people all over the globe, develop the appropriate tools, products, skills
and systems for this, all while spending less time producing these goods
and services. The only catch is that we would have to deal with what, in
today's terms, would look like 50% unemployment. Ways that this could be
handled were discussed in the last issue of <I>IN CONTEXT, </I>and I don't
want to here repeat that discussion. Rather I would just stress that our
problem is not a lack of workable techniques. Our problem is one of perception
and vision. We have not yet understood how important this issue is nor how
great an opportunity it opens for us, so we have not been willing to seriously
explore the new social institutions it will require. The contribution that
the North American vision brings to this is to emphasize that its basic
commitment is to the healthy balance of freedom, equality and community,
and <I>not </I>to particular economic institutions. It encourages us to
adjust these institutions in response to the changing times so that those
more fundamental social values can be maintained and enhanced.</P>

<P>As for the arms race, it is too vast a subject to adequately deal with
in this article - indeed &quot;peace&quot; is the theme of the whole Autumn
1983 issue. Nevertheless, it seems to me that clearly the North American
vision encourages us to shift our attention away from dominance and the
projection of power and back to what is truly &quot;defense&quot;. As William
Becker points out in <I>The Indefensible Society </I>and Amory and Hunter
Lovins point out in <I>Brittle Power, </I>our dependence on complex centralized
systems makes our society remarkably vulnerable to even a few saboteurs,
not to mention a full scale military power:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><I>&quot;A handful of people, for example, could turn off three-quarters
  of the oil and gas supplies to the eastern States, for upwards of a year,
  in one evening's work without leaving Louisiana. A few people could black
  out a city, a region, or even the whole country for months - perhaps for
  years. Attacks on certain natural gas systems could incinerate a city.
  Sabotage of a nuclear facility could make vast areas uninhabitable. All
  these could be accomplished by simple, low-technology attack. And because
  terrorist attacks on the energy system are so devastating - yet cheap,
  safe, deniable, and even anonymous - they may become the most attractive
  form of military attack.&quot; </I>(Lovins and Lovins in <I>Rain, </I>June/July
  1983, p. 4)</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>If we really cared about defense, about protecting the society against
coercion, we would be shifting our &quot;defense&quot; spending away from
the tools for global dominance and towards such things as decentralized
energy systems. We would decentralize industry and our economy. We would
also be making a strong commitment to local networking and community building,
and specifically developing the skills and simple equipment that would enable
local resistance to coercion to be so resilient and resourceful that it
would make attempts to conquer these areas simply not worth the effort.
Such an approach is clearly completely in keeping with the North American
vision. It would also greatly reduce the current enormous waste of arms
spending (not to mention reducing the risk of war) which would in turn aid
the environment and the plight of people all over the world.</P>

<P>Putting this all together, we can see the direction towards which the
North American vision would point us if we were to take seriously its commitment
to the building of a &quot;beyond dominance&quot; society. In this interpretation,
the agenda that flows from the North American vision includes 1) democratizing
corporate North America via such approaches as the Mondragon Cooperatives,
2) decentralizing government and making it more flexible, 3) deregulating
monopoly professions, 4) reinhabiting the land, 5) redistributing work and
buying power to allow us to pursue true societal efficiency, and 6) redirecting
our &quot;defense&quot; efforts towards decentralization and genuine defensibility.
This represents a major restructuring of our institutions, but it is no
greater than the changes we have already gone through in the past few centuries.
Some, no doubt, will find it uncomfortably radical, but I expect we will
have to think this boldly if we are to avoid the disasters that business
as usual has in store, and keep alive the vision of freedom, equality and
community through self-rule. It seems noteworthy that much of this agenda
calls for action that is not primarily legislative. It is a <I>cultural
</I>agenda with politics playing only a supporting role.</P>

<P>How does this agenda address the issues of &quot;responsibility but not
burden&quot; raised by the first two articles in this section? By focusing
our attention on &quot;cleaning our own house&quot;, it seems to me that
it does accomplish that combined goal. I do not mean to rule out direct
emergency aid to the desperate and displaced, but I feel our real work is
to deal with underlying causes. The best way we can be of help to the world
is to pioneer our own particular version of a humane sustainable post-civilizational
culture. By doing this, we can reduce the burden of our current high levels
of consumption and build the tools and systems that others will be free
to learn from. There is no need to do this in isolation, and we can be willing
to learn from and work with others (as the use of the Mondragon model shows).</P>

<P>The challenge of building a &quot;new world&quot; here on this continent
is far from over, nor is the North American vision a dead relic. If we would
but have the eyes to see, we would rediscover its power and relevance, its
vibrancy and glad hope.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>The Eco-village Challenge</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by <A HREF="../../PEOPLE/RCGBio.htm">Robert Gilman</A></I></H4>

<P><BR>
For humankind at the end of the 20th century there is hardly anything more
appealing - yet apparently more elusive - than the prospect of living in
harmony with nature and with each other. What are the possibilities for
realizing this dream, and what are the highest-leverage actions that could
help us all toward such a future? This issue explores this question by considering
the current status and likely prospects for a particularly powerful approach
to achieving this dream of harmonious living: the eco-village. We will also
explore the broader concept of sustainable communities, and the idea of
community in general.<BR>
<BR>
There is, at this time, no generally agreed-upon definition of an <I>eco-village</I>.
For the purposes of this issue, we will define an eco-village as a</P>

<UL>
  <LI>human-scale<BR>
  
  <LI>full-featured settlement<BR>
  
  <LI>in which human activities are harmlessly integrated into the natural
  world<BR>
  
  <LI>in a way that is supportive of healthy human development and can be
  successfully continued into the indefinite future.
</UL>

<P><B><BR>
&quot;A human-scale...&quot;</B> * Human-scale refers to a size in which
people are able to know and be known by the others in the community, and
where each member of the community feels he or she is able to influence
the community's direction. There is considerable practical evidence, both
in modern industrial societies and in other cultures, that the upper limit
for such a group is roughly 500 people. In very stable and isolated situations
it can be higher, perhaps as high as 1,000, while in situations typical
of modern industrial societies it is often lower, even less than 100.<B><BR>
<BR>
&quot;...full-featured settlement...&quot; </B>* A &quot;full-featured settlement&quot;
is one in which all the major functions of normal living - residence, food
provision, manufacture, leisure, social life, and commerce - are plainly
present and in balanced proportions. Most current human settlement in the
industrialized world - urban, suburban, and rural - is entirely divided
by function: some areas are residential, some are for shopping, some are
industrial, etc. These districts are usually too large to be human-scale,
even within a single function. In contrast, the eco-village is a comprehensible
microcosm of the whole of society.<BR>
<BR>
This does not mean that eco-villages have to be fully self-sufficient or
isolated from the surrounding community. As an ideal, an eco-village will
have as many jobs within it as there are employed people who live in the
eco-village; but some of the villagers will go outside the village to work,
and some of the jobs in the village will be held by people who reside outside
the village.<BR>
<BR>
There are also many specialized services that clearly cannot be located
in each eco-village - hospitals, airports, etc. Yet with cooperation among
villages, essentially any large institution could be successfully run by
clusters and networks, permitting a fully functioning modern <I>society
</I>to be mostly comprised of eco-village units.<B><BR>
<BR>
&quot;...in which human activities are harmlessly integrated into the natural
world...&quot;</B> * This idea brings the &quot;eco&quot; into the eco-village.
One of the most important aspects of this principle is the ideal of equality
between humans and other forms of life, so that humans do not attempt to
dominate over nature but rather find their place within it. Another important
principle is the <I>cyclic </I>use of material resources, rather than the
linear approach (dig it up, use it once, throw it away forever) that has
characterized industrial society. This leads eco-villages to the use of
renewable energy sources (solar, wind, etc.) rather than fossil fuels; to
the composting of organic wastes which are then returned to the land rather
than sending these to a landfill, incinerator, or sewage treatment plant;
to the recycling of as much of the waste stream as possible; and to the
avoidance of toxic and harmful substances. <B><BR>
<BR>
&quot;... in a way that is supportive of healthy human development...&quot;</B>
* This fourth principle recognizes that eco-villages are, after all, human
communities, and without genuine human health at the core, these communities
are unlikely to be successful. What is &quot;healthy human development&quot;?
To attempt a complete definition would take a book, at least! Suffice it
to say here that I see this as involving a balanced and integrated development
of all aspects of human life - physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual.
This healthy development needs to be expressed not just in the lives of
individuals, but in the life of the community as a whole. <B><BR>
<BR>
&quot;... and that can be successfully continued into the indefinite future.&quot;</B>
* This last principle - the sustainability principle - forces a kind of
honesty on eco-villagers. Without it, it would be easy (or at least easier)
in the short-term to create human-scale communities that <I>seemed </I>to
be harmoniously integrated into nature and to be full-featured, but in fact
were in some not-so-visible way living off the capital accumulated in other
parts of the society; or dependent on unsustainable activities elsewhere;
or not inclusive of a major aspect of life (such as childhood or old age).
The sustainability principle brings with it a profound commitment to fairness
and non-exploitation - toward other parts of today's world, human and non-human,
and toward all future life.<B><BR>
<BR>
Sustainable Community</B> * The more general term &quot;sustainable community&quot;
includes eco-villages, but it also includes clusters and networks of eco-villages,
and non-geographically based &quot;communities&quot; (such as businesses)
that are nevertheless human-scale in their components, diverse, and harmoniously
integrated into the natural world. In this sense, an eco-village is a distinct
place, either as a rural village or as an urban/suburban neighborhood. A
city could not be an eco-village, but a city <I>made up of eco-villages</I>
could be a sustainable community.</P>

<H4><BR>
FORWARD, NOT BACK</H4>

<P>If eco-villages are such a great idea, why don't we already live in them?<BR>
<BR>
One oft-suggested response is that, in fact, most people already do live
in &quot;eco-villages&quot; - that is, the best model for an eco-village
is the traditional agricultural village - and to regain harmony with nature
and with each other, all we need do is return to that traditional way of
life. I disagree.<BR>
<BR>
While it is true that there is much to be learned from these villages (they
still contain about half the world's population), few people today - including
most traditional villagers! - would describe these villages as either full-featured
or supportive of healthy human development. The work is hard, life expectancy
is short, opportunities for personal development and education are few (almost
non-existent for women), and the diversity of livelihoods is small.<BR>
<BR>
In addition, the harmony between these villages and the natural environment
has often depended on low population densities - a luxury we no longer have.
Traditional villagers around the world use three main types of agriculture:
slash-and-burn, dry-land rain-fed, and irrigated. Of these, slash-and-burn
is the most environmentally demanding and requires the lowest population
density. But even irrigation, which supports the highest population density,
can be environmentally damaging, as the ecological collapse of many past
irrigation-based civilizations attests.<BR>
<BR>
And finally, traditional villages are hardly paragons of harmony between
humans. Village life is often, from a modern point of view, painfully patriarchal.
Beyond the household there is feuding and mistrust within villages, between
neighboring villages, and toward the world beyond.<BR>
<BR>
True eco-villages, in contrast, are a distinctly post-industrial (and likely
even post-agricultural) phenomenon. While they draw on lessons from all
of human experience, they are not a return to any previous period or way
of life.<BR>
<BR>
Eco-villages grow out of the needs and opportunities caused by:</P>

<UL>
  <LI><I>new ecological constraints</I> - which grow out of high levels of
  population and technological capability;<BR>
  
  <LI><I>new techniques and technologies</I>, from better understanding of
  ecosystems to more diverse channels of communications; from efficient technologies
  for renewable resource use to new forms of human organization; and<BR>
  
  <LI><I>new levels of consciousness and awareness</I>, symbolized in part
  by the picture of the Earth from space, with all that means in terms of
  global consciousness and an awareness of the many-billion-year history
  of life on this one small planet in the vastness of the Universe.
</UL>

<P><BR>
In spite of its increasingly-evident lack of sustainability, industrial
society has the momentum of hundreds of years of institution building and
capital development. Given the enormous infrastructure and social patterning
in place, it has so far been much easier for people to keep living in the
same old unsustainable ways than to pioneer sustainable communities.<BR>
<BR>
The answer, then, to why we aren't living in eco-villages yet is fairly
simple: these needs and opportunities are so new we have not had time as
a society to adjust to them. We are at the very beginning of a new era,
and we can expect much of the development of technique and awareness that
will characterize this era to be still ahead of us.</P>

<H4><BR>
ECO-VILLAGE CHALLENGES</H4>

<P>While it may seem more difficult to pioneer sustainable communities than
to live within an untenable status quo, numerous groups have been doing
so for decades (with precursors that go back much further), as some of the
articles that follow will illustrate. To appreciate the difficulties these
pioneers have faced, let's look at the various challenges that the eco-village
vision entails.<B><BR>
<BR>
The bio-system challenge</B> * To fulfill the ideal that the activities
of the eco-village be harmlessly integrated into the natural world requires
that the eco-village find ecologically friendly ways to:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>preserve natural habitats on the village land<BR>
  
  <LI>produce food, wood, and other bio-resources on site<BR>
  
  <LI>process the organic waste produced on site<BR>
  
  <LI>render harmless any initially toxic waste from the village<BR>
  
  <LI>recycle all solid waste from the village<BR>
  
  <LI>process liquid waste from the village<BR>
  
  <LI>avoid adverse environmental impacts off site from the production and
  delivery of any products brought in from off site<BR>
  
  <LI>avoid adverse environmental impacts off site from the use and disposal
  of any products.
</UL>

<P><B><BR>
The built-environment challenge</B> * To fulfill the ideal that the activities
of the eco-village be harmlessly integrated into the natural world also
requires that the eco-village:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>build with ecologically friendly materials<BR>
  
  <LI>use renewable energy sources<BR>
  
  <LI>handle solid, liquid, and gaseous wastes from buildings in an ecologically
  friendly manner<BR>
  
  <LI>have a minimal need for motorized transport<BR>
  
  <LI>build in ways that have a minimal impact on the land and the local
  ecology.
</UL>

<P><BR>
To fulfill the ideal that the eco-village support healthy human development
requires that the buildings in the community:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>have a good balance of public space and private space<BR>
  
  <LI>encourage community interaction<BR>
  
  <LI>support a full diversity of activities.
</UL>

<P><B><BR>
The economic system challenge</B> * To fulfill the ideal that the eco-village
support healthy human development and be full-featured requires that there
be significant economic activity in the eco-village. To fulfill the ideal
of fairness and non-exploitation that is part of the sustainability principle
requires that the economic activities of the members of an eco-village not
depend on exploitation of other people and places, nor on exploitation of
the future by the present. The implications of these goals are not as clear
as, for example, the implication for the built-environment that energy sources
should be renewable. Instead, we can identify some of the likely questions
that an eco-village will face concerning its economic system:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>What are sustainable economic activities, both in terms of what will
  sustain the members of the community and what is sustainable in ecological
  terms?<BR>
  
  <LI>What parts of the community should be held in common and what parts
  owned privately?<BR>
  
  <LI>More specifically, how should the ownership of land and buildings be
  handled?<BR>
  
  <LI>How can we be simultaneously economically and ecologically efficient,
  so as to reduce both expenses and environmental impact?<BR>
  
  <LI>What are the most appropriate forms of business organization for eco-village
  associated businesses?<BR>
  
  <LI>Are there useful alternatives and/or supplements to the money economy
  for facilitating economic exchange within and between eco-villages?
</UL>

<P><B><BR>
The governance challenge</B> * As with economics, the ideals of fairness
and nonexploitation point eco-villages in a general direction, but do not
provide clear guidance as to how these ideals are to be put into practice.
Here again, however, we can identify some of the likely questions that an
eco-village will face concerning its governance:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>How will decisions be made, and which methods will be used for what
  types of decisions?<BR>
  
  <LI>How will conflicts be resolved?<BR>
  
  <LI>How will decisions by the community be enforced?<BR>
  
  <LI>What will be the roles for, and expectations of, leader-ship?<BR>
  
  <LI>How will the eco-village relate to the government(s) in the surrounding
  community?
</UL>

<P><B><BR>
The &quot;glue&quot; challenge</B> * To deal with all these challenges the
members of the eco-village need something that holds them together, some
basis of shared values and vision that can provide a &quot;glue&quot;. Developing
and maintaining this glue is yet another level of challenge which will raise
questions such as:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>What is the appropriate interplay of unity and diversity?<BR>
  
  <LI>What common values, behaviors, or practices will be expected in the
  group?<BR>
  
  <LI>What, if anything, is the group's shared vision?<BR>
  
  <LI>How shall the group discover, develop, and evolve that vision? <BR>
  
  <LI>How close shall the group be interpersonally?<BR>
  
  <LI>How is this closeness best developed?<BR>
  
  <LI>How will the group relate to others outside the group?
</UL>

<P><B><BR>
The whole-system challenge</B> * There is an even deeper, and often unperceived,
&quot;whole-system&quot; challenge. Perhaps the biggest challenge faced
by anyone attempting to create an eco-village is that it requires change
in so many different areas of life. All too often community founders attempt
to, or feel forced to, work on all aspects of these changes simultaneously.
Almost all of these changes take longer than expected and are often more
costly than expected. In addition, each area of change interacts with the
other areas in unpredictable ways. In the process, financial resources,
emotional resources, and interpersonal relationships can be put under great
stress. When attempts to create communities have failed, one of the reasons
has almost always been that the group simply tried to do too much too fast
relative to the resources they had available.<BR>
<BR>
The whole-system challenge is to get an honest sense of the scope of the
undertaking and then develop an approach that allows the community to develop
at a sustainable pace. <I>In other words, sustainability is not just a characteristic
of the &quot;completed&quot; community; it needs to be part of the thinking
and the habits of the group from the very beginning.</I><BR>
<BR>
Building a successful eco-village requires a balance of activities among
three major phases - 1) research and design, 2) creation and implementation,
and 3) maintenance - for each of the challenge areas.<BR>
<BR>
It's helpful to use a simple diagram to represent the basic relationship
between these challenges:<BR>
</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="WholeSys.gif" WIDTH="319" HEIGHT="136" ALIGN=
"BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></P>

<P>This is a &quot;building block&quot; diagram, in which some parts of
the system &quot;rest&quot; on other parts. The bio-system and the built-environment
provide the most obvious and visible &quot;requirements&quot; for an eco-village.
They are the &quot;top&quot; building blocks. <BR>
<BR>
Moving down the diagram, we see that it represents the idea that achieving
success in the bio-system and the built-environment areas depends - is &quot;built
on&quot; - successfully dealing with the economic and governance challenges.
Success in these areas in turn depends on successfully dealing with the
glue challenges.<BR>
<BR>
Finally, all of the more specific challenge areas depend on successfully
dealing with the whole-system challenge. It encompasses, rather than underlies,
all the others. It is not a building block, but a living wholeness.<BR>
<BR>
Given these challenges, it should be no surprise that as far as we have
been able to discover, there are as yet no communities that <I>fully </I>express
the eco-village ideal. This is the bad news. The good news is that there
are <I>many </I>communities and other groups that have made considerable
progress on every one of these challenges. There are even some communities
that could, within a few years, be considered full eco-villages. <BR>
<BR>
Those who would now turn their efforts to reaching this goal - either by
starting a new community or by evolving an existing one - fortunately do
not need to start from scratch. We invite you to read on.<BR>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Guidelines For Eco-Village Development</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by <A HREF="../../PEOPLE/RCGBio.htm">Robert Gilman</A></I></H4>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>You might think that guidelines for eco-village development would mostly
have to do with their &quot;eco&quot; aspect - that is, how to handle the
biosystem and built environment. These are certainly important, but in researching
this issue - and interviewing many people with extensive community experience
- we have learned that the physical systems are the easiest part. They are
also the most variable, since the details depend so strongly on the specifics
of the community: its location, purpose, and composition.</P>

<P>These guidelines focus, instead, on where we perceive the need to be
greatest - the <I>process</I> of eco-village development:</P>

<P><B>1. <I>Recognize it will be a journey - and enjoy it!</I></B><I> </I>*
If you have an &quot;eco-village dream,&quot; and focus too strongly on
the desired end result, you set yourself and others up for frustration and
disappointment. The process of community development takes time - usually
many years. Joan Halifax, director of the Ojai Foundation, speaks for many
community founders in the following story: &quot;The Dalai Lama told me
in an interview that there were three conditions that would make it possible
to accomplish my vision for the community here: Great love, great persistence,
great patience. Patience is the hardest of all!&quot;</P>

<P>It helps to recognize right from the start that a community is <I>always
</I>in process, and it is best to honor and enjoy the process.</P>

<P><B>2. <I>Develop a vision - and keep developing it</I></B> * A clear,
shared vision is one of the most important kinds of &quot;glue&quot; a group
can have. For a vision to work as glue, however, it needs to be more than
an intellectual construct. At its best, a vision gives voice to the full
essence and deeply-felt purpose of the group. There are many ways of developing
a vision (and a vision statement), but however arrived at, the vision will
be most effective if each member of the group feels a resounding personal
&quot;Yes!&quot; in response to it. Keep the vision alive by revisiting
it regularly as a group to see whether it still feels right.</P>

<P><B>3. <I>Build relationships and bonding</I></B> * The other fundamental
glue for a group comes from the heart. It is vital to build solid interpersonal
relationships, mutual understanding, caring, and trust. Building such relationships
isn't necessarily easy, but <I>doing </I>things together - eating, singing,
dancing, telling life stories, traveling - facilitates the process much
faster than meetings!</P>

<P><B>4. <I>Make the whole-system challenge explicit</I></B> * Once the
group has begun to clarify its vision and build relationships, get the group
oriented to the tasks that need to be accomplished. Personality style conflicts
may arise here: some prefer to begin with planning, others would rather
plunge in and experiment. The challenge for the group as a whole is to get
these two tendencies into a constructive relationship, so that they contribute
to each other. You'll need both.</P>

<P><B>5. <I>Get help - to become more self-reliant</I></B> * Knowledge about
sustainable community development is growing so quickly that it's unlikely
the founding group will know everything. For some specific topics, such
as building details, it may make sense to depend entirely on outside expertise.
On many others, however, it makes sense to develop expertise within the
group. Include plenty of time and resources in your budget for group <I>learning
</I>about how to do things, how to manage tasks, and how to build group
process and interpersonal skills. Lack of management or process skills is
the number one reason communities fail.</P>

<P><B>6. <I>Develop clear procedures </I></B>* Community should be an adventure
among friends, not an exercise in bureaucracy. The painful experience of
many groups makes it clear, however, that a little bureaucracy is both necessary
and helpful. Specifically, it is wise to develop clear, <I>written </I>procedures
for decision making, resolving disputes, handling finances, and determining
membership. Perhaps even more important is to develop &quot;meta-procedures&quot;
for making changes to these (and other) procedures. Groups change, so plan
on changing your procedures, too - frequently at first, more slowly later
as the group matures.</P>

<P><B>7. <I>Maintain balance - sustainably </I></B>* Once the group is formed,
there will be <I>many </I>specific tasks required to develop its eco-village
or sustainable community, and many important balances to be maintained:</P>

<P>(a) <I>Between &quot;group&quot; and &quot;private&quot;</I> * People
need some of each, often in changing quantities.</P>

<P>(b) <I>Between today and tomorrow</I> * If not well paced, the group
could either do too much too soon and exhaust itself, or procrastinate and
become a debating society.</P>

<P>(c) <I>Between &quot;hardware&quot; and &quot;software&quot;</I>* Some
people are drawn to images of solar homes and permaculture gardens, others
are most interested in the feeling of community. One aspect or another may
need to be emphasized at different times, but the success of the community
depends on their balanced development and a shared appreciation for both.</P>

<P>(d) <I>Among love, light, and will</I> * Every community can benefit
from cultivating the positive qualities of the heart (bonding, caring, trust),
the mind (clarity of understanding, vision, integrity), and the will (the
ability to act with courage and effectiveness). The challenge is to integrate
them in a balanced way. Affirming the importance of this balance within
the vision of the group can be a powerful touchstone for assessing and readjusting
group progress.</P>

<P>(e) <I>Among different learning and cognitive styles</I> * We can hardly
emphasize enough the importance of developing clear understandings in the
group of the many ways that people are different. Most of the disagreements
within groups have to do with arguments over learning and cognitive styles,
<I>not </I>over matters of substance. For example, some people would rather
talk and then act, others would rather act and then talk, still others just
want to act, and of course there are always those who just want to talk.
Such differences, working in right relationship, can complement each other
in ways that will be liberating for each person. In wrong relationship,
they lead to endless power struggles.</P>

<P>(f) <I>Among current consumption, investment, and service</I> * Sustainability
is fundamentally about fairness and balance across time. One of the most
concrete ways to express this is through a balance among expenditures -
of time as well as money - on <I>current consumption</I> (from food to entertainment),
<I>investment </I>(from building to education), and <I>service to others</I>
(which may involve either current consumption or investment). Boundaries
may blur, but if the future benefits are high, it is generally an investment.
If the benefits are primarily here and now, it is current consumption. Healthy
living - and avoiding burn-out - require a balance of both.</P>

<P>The spirit of <I>sustainable service</I> provides a healthy antidote
for imbalances in either direction. Service focuses beyond the self and
can thus lift one beyond self-centered current consumption. At the same
time, <I>sustainable </I>service suggests that some &quot;current consumption&quot;
is necessary to nurture today's server, so that he or she can serve tomorrow
as well.</P>

<P><B>8. <I>Be open and honest</I></B> * Finally, the evidence is strong
that for many community issues - including the always sensitive issues of
sex, power, and money - what you do is less important than how openly and
honestly you do it. For example, some successful communities are based on
celibacy, while others are based on group marriages. These seemingly opposite
approaches can both work. What <I>doesn't </I>work - what gets communities
into trouble - is when the public story no longer fits the private behavior,
especially if those in leadership positions are the ones breaking the rules.</P>

<P>The issue of power provides another good example. Many communities adopt
the ideal of complete equality of power, but in fact such equality essentially
never happens in human groups. There is always a &quot;power gradient,&quot;
with some people having more influence than others. The attempt to maintain
the <I>fiction </I>of complete equality can lead to a collective denial
of the <I>actual dynamics </I>in the group. The paradox (and tragedy) of
such a situation is that it encourages &quot;hidden&quot; abuses of power
while at the same time suppressing and discouraging genuinely needed visible
leadership.</P>

<P>A healthier approach is to acknowledge what is, while also honoring one's
ideals. The group may also find that it can reformulate its ideals in a
way that better honors their deep meaning (for example, equal fairness for
all may be more important than equal power) and better fits the complex
truth of their experience.</P>

<P>Now take another look at Step 1. You're on your way!</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Reclaiming Politics</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by <A HREF="../../PEOPLE/RCGBio.htm">Robert Gilman</A></I></H4>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Something strange is happening on the American political landscape. After
decades of steadily declining voter participation, and many other signs
of growing citizen alienation, Americans are finally reawakening to politics.
Why now?</P>

<P>Most of the media pundits, in analyzing recent election results, have
focused on the combination of the uncertainty in the economy and various
congressional scandals as the key that is unlocking people's interest. No
doubt there is some truth to this, but the economy has often been in much
worse shape during the past few decades; and it seems like there has always
been some political scandal keeping the press active. There must be something
more.</P>

<H4>EROSION AT THE CENTER</H4>

<P>That something more, I've come to believe, is the disintegration of a
fundamental assumption that has dominated American politics for decades.
To understand this shift, we need to go back to the end of World War II.
North America emerged from the war as the only major industrial area still
intact. The United States was, in fact, <I>the</I> superpower - economically,
technologically, militarily, and in popular culture. One indicator of the
level of US dominance was that in 1948 the US accounted for 2/3 of the economic
activity of the <I>whole world. </I>US society didn't wake up to its new
status for a while, but by the time of the Eisenhower era, we were quite
comfortable with our new role as the &quot;affluent society.&quot;</P>

<P>Out of this comfort came an idea that has since dominated American politics:
The &quot;center&quot; (i.e. the US mainstream) is basically doing OK, and
all that's left to do is to tidy up the &quot;edges.&quot;</P>

<P>The conservatives felt that the &quot;edge&quot; which most needed attention
was communism - that irritant on the frontier of &quot;our&quot; world.
Most of the politically significant liberals shared a concern about communism
(at least they were willing to vote for billions of dollars to fight it),
but they also felt that the internal &quot;edges&quot; - poverty, civil
rights, etc. - needed attention as well.</P>

<P>The height of this &quot;we're OK, let's tidy the edges&quot; attitude
came in the early 1960s with the combination of the Civil Rights Act, the
Peace Corps, the War On Poverty, and the &quot;police action&quot; in Vietnam.
While these were all controversial, nevertheless there were enough people
who felt sufficiently comfortable in their own lives and who believed in
the American ideals they had learned in school - and fought for during World
War II - that they were glad to generously spread their good fortune out
to the &quot;edges.&quot;</P>

<P>Popular support for this approach began to erode as early as the late
1960s. Nevertheless, US global dominance remained basically intact. Even
as recently as 1985 the US portion of world economic activity was still
45%, almost half. Now it is less than a third and falling.</P>

<P>The general comfort level in the mainstream permitted the activists who
dominated both political parties to continue to pursue their various &quot;edge-fixing&quot;
agendas. The Democratic party became a magnet for every racial, ethnic,
sexual preference, and differently-abled group that felt (usually quite
rightly) that it was not getting a fair deal, that it was an &quot;edge.&quot;
Correspondingly, the Republicans attracted the religious right, libertarians,
and entrepreneurs - groups that felt marginalized (turned into &quot;edges&quot;)
by the prevailing sentiments expressed in the &quot;liberal&quot; press.</P>

<P>In either case, the message was clear: &quot;There are no pressing problems
facing society as a whole, at least none that can be addressed through politics.
The only issues appropriate for politics are special interest (or edge adjustment)
issues.&quot; Even the environment and education have somehow been fit into
this mold. Given this message, it should hardly surprise us that more and
more eligible voters dropped out of the formal political process over the
last few decades. Those who saw themselves on one edge or another, especially
the poor, grew tired of promises without results. Those who saw themselves
in the center felt they had better (or more enjoyable) things to do than
involve themselves in an activity with little direct connection to their
lives.</P>

<P>This situation is now going through a massive shift. The current economic
recession is hitting the center as well as the edges and seems to be pushing
people to acknowledge that the center is no longer OK. We may have &quot;won&quot;
the Cold War, but it is increasingly obvious that we have been losing ground
in almost every other facet of our lives.</P>

<P>Is this just a temporary problem, something that can be fixed with a
new team in Washington, DC? I doubt it. The problems we have accumulated
over the past decades are too massive to be cleared away in just a few years.</P>

<H4>LIMITS TO BUSINESS-AS-USUAL</H4>

<P>Yet even if we could somehow magically erase the usual list of problems
- high levels of debt, poor schools, persistent poverty, etc. - and get
back to business-as-usual, there is still another, more profound way in
which &quot;the center is no longer OK.&quot;</P>

<P>By now it is becoming quite clear that if we do not make massive changes
in our relationship to the environment - particularly the rate at which
we are consuming resources and generating waste - we will very likely create
a series of global economic, social and ecological catastrophes beginning
within the next few decades. This is the consensus from reputable sources
such as the United Nations Environment Program, Worldwatch Institute, scientists
who study species extinction, those researching global climate change, and
many, many others.</P>

<P>It is hard to know just how bad these catastrophes could get, but one
thing is clear. If we keep on with business-as-usual we will go through
a cycle that system theorists describe as &quot;overshoot and collapse.&quot;</P>

<P>Back in 1972, Donella Meadows, Dennis Meadows, J&oslash;rgen Randers
and William Behrens III published the now famous study, <I>The Limits to
Growth</I> (NY: Signet), in which they showed that business-as-usual would
lead to overshoot and collapse in world population, industrial production
per capita and food per capita (see figure below). In their model the collapse
began in the first quarter of the 21st century and continued down for at
least the rest of the century.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../../IMAGES/Ov%26Clps.gif" WIDTH="419" HEIGHT=
"287" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><I>Figure 1: Overshoot and collapse from business-as-usual based on
  the computer model used for </I>The Limits to Growth.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The first three authors are now working on a 20-years-after review of
<I>The Limits to Growth</I>, and they have shared with us some of their
pre-publication results. They have found that the real numbers between 1970
and 1990 followed the tracks &quot;predicted&quot; in 1972 remarkably well,
and that the underlying model needed only minor modifications to bring it
up to date.</P>

<P>The only way to avoid the catastrophes that would result from &quot;overshoot
and collapse&quot; is to make changes <I>well before</I> we are absolutely
forced to. There is - fortunately - lots of good news here. The necessary
changes to avert this collapse are well within our human and technological
capacity, as we have discussed in many previous issues of <I>IN CONTEXT</I>.
For example, by shifting to proven more-efficient technologies, we could
greatly reduce our resource use and rate of pollution creation. By changing
dietary habits to reduce our consumption of grain-fed livestock, we could
expand our effective food supply without putting more pressure on agricultural
land. There are, in fact, a wealth of proven practical steps we can take
that would not only avert the catastrophe, but would usher us into a much
more humane and sustainable era. Indeed, when these steps are put into the
<I>The Limits to Growth</I> model, the result is a smooth transition to
a sustainable world.</P>

<P>So why don't we take these steps? Because what makes practical sense
and what makes political sense are very different things:</P>

<P><B><I>From a practical point of view</I></B>, making changes will be
much easier <I>before </I>the collapse.</P>

<P>* We can choose now, while we still have fossil fuels and other non-renewable
resources, to <I>invest</I> these into building a society and economy based
on renewable energy, the careful recycling of materials, and the equitable
economic institutions required for a sustainable society.</P>

<P>* In so doing, we can still rely on our basic ecological and social systems,
for although these are under stress, most are still functioning.</P>

<P>* In contrast, after the collapse, in a world where disasters have torn
the social and economic fabric apart, wasted our remaining natural resources,
and caused great environmental damage, constructive change will be much
more difficult, at the very least. Many actions, such as restoring ecosystems
whose key species have become extinct, will be simply impossible.</P>

<P><B><I>From a political point of view</I></B>, however, there will continue
to be a lot of pressure to delay these changes as long as possible.</P>

<P>* Such a fundamental shift in our way of life will mean massive economic
changes. Whole new industries will grow while others will become obsolete.
Many people will need to change jobs, and many current investments will
lose their value.</P>

<P>* Those who stand to lose, at least in the short term, are currently
well-established, organized, and powerful. Those who stand to gain, on the
other hand, are either currently dispersed and unorganized or simply have
no political voice - such as today's and tomorrow's children.</P>

<P>In the past, those who have felt the need for change have generally responded
to this classic political problem with either 1) despair and inaction or
2) confrontation and polarization. The first accomplishes nothing, and the
second has proven to be a very painful, costly, and often ineffectual method
of significant cultural change. Given the unprecedented magnitude of the
challenges we face, we can not afford either choice.</P>

<H4>STRATEGIES FOR RECLAIMING POLITICS</H4>

<P>What, then, <I>are</I> we to do? I have no overall answer, but I would
like to share some ideas that seem to point in the right direction:</P>

<P><B><I>We will each be a gainer and a loser.</I></B> We are truly all
in this together, and it makes factual, moral, and strategic sense to stay
well aware of our common interests and common destiny. Some will, of course,
act in opposition to the changes necessary to reach a sustainable world.
Yet delaying these changes will soon harm their quality of life as well.
As Ted Turner said recently, &quot;It is no fun being rich in a dying world.&quot;</P>

<P>At the same time, those of us who promote such changes need to acknowledge
the things that we will all be losing, such as the childlike/childish innocence
of being able to treat nature as inexhaustible and infinitely resilient.
Such acknowledgement can help us follow Gandhi's example in never losing
sight of our profound connection to those who, today, happen to be playing
the role of our opponents.</P>

<P>We also would do well to remember the clear lesson from successful conflict
resolution: expanding on &quot;common ground&quot; is the fastest, more
realistic path to meaningful change. Polarization and confrontation are
useful, at most, as an occasional spice within the main course of pursuing
our common interest.</P>

<P><B><I>Diffusion is more effective than coercion.</I></B> Two issues back
Alan AtKisson described the process of &quot;innovation diffusion&quot;
- that is, the free spread of new ideas, technologies, values, etc. throughout
a culture (see &quot;The Innovation Diffusion Game,&quot; <I>IN CONTEXT</I>
#28, page 58). The spread of the <I>fax machine</I> and of <I>environmental
awareness</I> are two very different examples of this diffusion process.</P>

<P>An important lesson here - as history is making clear - is that any innovation
that can be spread through <I>free adoption</I> will likely spread faster
and last longer than an innovation that requires the <I>power of the state</I>
to bring it into being. Some changes can only be handled through legislation,
but we should challenge our creativity by searching long and hard to find
<I>diffusion-based</I> strategies before turning to government.</P>

<P>I say <I>strategies </I>(plural) because there are many ways to assist
the diffusion process. Indeed a key insight into the diffusion process is
that the most appropriate strategy for assisting the spread of an innovation
changes <I>dramatically </I>as the innovation becomes more widely adopted.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../../IMAGES/S-strat.gif" WIDTH="362" HEIGHT=
"370" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></P>

<P>The above figure gives the basic pattern: At first, the innovation needs
to be refined through <B>experimentation </B>and <B>pilot projects</B>.
Pushing to spread an innovation before it has proven itself usually does
more harm than good.</P>

<P>Once the innovation has proven its worth, the next step is the development
of businesses and organizations that can provide an <B>support-system</B>
or infrastructure<B> </B>through which the innovation can become available
beyond the circle of experimenters. This infrastructure is built through
spreading the innovation to &quot;early adoptors,&quot; people who are already
predisposed to change. At this early stage, attempting to convince the uninterested
or the hostile is a waste of effort.</P>

<P>It is only <I>after </I>that infrastructure is in place that it makes
sense to &quot;go public&quot; through the major media to a broader audience
of interested people. For some innovations, this <B>popularization </B>phase
may be all that is needed to spread them as far as they can go.</P>

<P>However, if the innovation is controversial, or if it needs government
support to become fully functional, eventually it will be necessary to enter
the arena of <B>electoral politics</B>. Political successes can provide
the innovation with increased respectability, plus leading to an improved
regulatory environment. This is the phase where those who actively oppose
the innovation need to be directly addressed, yet it is still best to do
so with as little polarization as possible.</P>

<P>Finally, once the innovation has gained majority support, it will occasionally
be appropriate to sweep up the laggards through legislation and <B>regulation</B>.
This step is full of dangers, since it imposes the &quot;tyranny of the
majority&quot; and can understandably provoke resentment. It makes sense
only when the laggards are creating clear harm through their non-adoption
(e.g., a laggard car company that did not include seat belts as standard
equipment). Remember, today's laggard may be tomorrow's innovator - as was
the case for organic farmers, who were laggards about adopting chemical
agriculture yet innovators for sustainable agriculture.</P>

<P>One bonus of focusing on the <I>full range</I> of diffusion strategies
rather than just on legislation is that entrenched interests are much less
able to slow the many routes of diffusion than they are able to block legislation.
There is so much innovative activity going on in so many places that it
is impossible for centralized institutions to keep track of it, much less
broadly interfere. Even totalitarian governments have been unable to control
it, and their ability to interfere is decreasing daily.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../../IMAGES/EqChg.gif" WIDTH="394" HEIGHT="112"
ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><I>The Equation Of Change</I></P>

<P><B><I>Reducing the &quot;cost of change&quot; offers great leverage</I></B>.
A third concept to consider is illustrated in figure above, which I call,
half-jokingly, the &quot;equation of change.&quot; What it says is that
in order for someone to switch from an old way of doing things to a new
way (i.e., to adopt an innovation), that person must feel that the additional
value provided by the new way is greater than the &quot;cost&quot; of making
the change. Note that the words &quot;value&quot; and &quot;cost&quot; are
to be understood in <I>psychological </I>as well as monetary terms.</P>

<P>If you have some innovation that you want to promote, this equation says
there are three things you can do: 1) Build up the perceived value of the
new way (as many innovators do). 2) Depress the perceived value of the old
way (as social critics do). 3) Decrease the cost of the change. Political
activist have often ignored the third term, but businesses know it to be
very important (&quot;easy credit, no money down,&quot; etc.).</P>

<P>From a whole-system perspective, it is best to use all three approaches,
giving special attention to whichever one offers the most leverage. Right
now, with more and more people feeling that &quot;the system isn't working&quot;
and with plenty of proven innovations available, the &quot;cost of change&quot;
has become the limiting factor. For example, public opinion polls consistently
show that large numbers of people are willing to make changes for the good
of the environment, but also that only a few have actually made these changes.
Doing whatever is possible to reduce the perceived cost of these changes
could unleash tremendous movement.</P>

<P>What do these strategic considerations have to do with reclaiming politics?
Potentially everything. In a time of possible overshoot and collapse we
must all be doing whatever it takes - and more importantly, whatever <I>works
</I>- to change society in increasingly necessary ways. These changes need
to be introduced, experimented with, refined, debated, occasionally even
voted on. Many of the most necessary changes will only happen if they are
well shepherded into the collective decision-making process. That process,
in all its myriad forms, is <I>politics </I>in the broadest sense - and
it is what we must now reclaim.</P>

<P>On its surface, the &quot;population explosion&quot; looks like a conceptually
simple problem with an equally simple solution: The world is getting crowded
and all these people are putting too much stress on the environment. The
obvious solution: have fewer children. Of course, there are mammoth political,
social and cultural roadblocks in the way, but if we could just cut the
birth rate we'd have the root cause of our environmental problems licked.</P>

<P>So it seems. Yet what we've found in developing this issue is that this
simple picture is at best only a half truth. Human family planning is part
of an intricate, and fascinating, web of relationships that touch on almost
every aspect of society - with many surprising consequences - and population
growth is more often a symptom than a cause of our fundamental problems.
This article explores that surprising web from two perspectives - one global
and one very personal.</P>

<H4>POSSIBLE FUTURES</H4>

<P>The best tool I've found for understanding the global dynamics of population
growth, and its related environmental and economic impacts, is the computer
model that served as the basis for <I>The Limits To Growth</I> twenty years
ago, and that has now been updated for <I>Beyond The Limits: Confronting
Global Collapse, Envisioning a Sustainable Future</I>, by Donella H. Meadows,
Dennis L. Meadows, and J&oslash;rgen Randers (available April 1992 from
Chelsea Green Publishing Co., PO Box 130, Post Mills, VT 05058).</P>

<P>This model is based on the best current understanding of the global system
as a whole, and it provides the clearest encapsulation of the challenges
of the 21st century that I have seen. It is, of course, only a model, and
because it treats the world as a unit, it necessarily involves many simplifications.
Nevertheless, it is very good at illustrating the basic patterns that result
from various fundamental cultural choices. We can learn a lot about &quot;human
family planning&quot; with its help.</P>

<P>Figure 1 illustrates how world population, food per person, industrial
output per person, remaining nonrenewable resources, and pollution have
changed since 1900. It also shows how these will likely change through 2100
if we keep on with business-as-usual. The pattern of rise and fall in these
curves represents a cycle that system theorists describe as &quot;overshoot
and collapse&quot; (see <I>IC</I> #30, p. 11).</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../../IMAGES/w3bau.gif" WIDTH="280" HEIGHT="197"
ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></P>

<P>In this particular case, the collapse is caused largely by an industrial
system that is crucially dependent on nonrenewable resources. As these resources
become harder to extract from the earth, requiring ever increasing amounts
of capital and energy just to get them into usable form, the economy becomes
trapped. It can't provide what it used to in the way of investment in agriculture,
consumer goods and services, and it no longer has the flexibility to restructure
itself to make better use of renewable resources. The economy thus spirals
down, pulling down agriculture and health care with it, yet still gobbling
up lots of nonrenewable resources along the way. Death rates rise dramatically
through hunger and disease, desperate humans ravage what is left of the
world's ecosystems, and the foreseeable future is uniformly bleak.</P>

<P>Is the model accurate? It mimics the behavior of the world from 1900
to now remarkably well. Its description of the future, however, is based
on assuming that people will keep behaving as they have during the 20th
century, and that our current knowledge of important data (such as the amount
of nonrenewable resources) is correct.</P>

<P>What if the data are wrong? Suppose, for example, that there are actually
more nonrenewable resources than the model assumes. The beauty of a computer
model is that it is easy to test such &quot;what if&quot; questions. If
we double the amount of nonrenewable resources that the model assumes, the
pattern of overshoot and collapse remains the same. The collapse gets delayed
by about two decades, and in this case is driven by declining soil fertility
and increased pollution, as well as the eventual exhaustion of nonrenewable
resources.</P>

<P>The result of this, and many similar tests, is that reasonable variations
in the data underlying the model do shift <I>when</I> the collapse occurs,
but they do not change the basic <I>pattern</I> of overshoot and collapse.
I should also point out that the model is not really designed for accuracy
once the collapse begins, since it does not include provisions for war,
social violence, or other likely breakdowns in the social system. In this
sense it is probably overly optimistic and gentle about the world's likely
behavior after the onset of a collapse.</P>

<P>What can we do to avoid such a fate? We have to change our behavior.
Figure 2 provides one example of how this could be done.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../../IMAGES/w3sd.gif" WIDTH="280" HEIGHT="197"
ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></P>

<P>In this figure, everything is the same as in Figure 1 until 1995. In
that year the world (within the model) changes its behavior in the following
ways:</P>

<P><B>Technology</B></P>

<P>* We begin moving away from our dependence on nonrenewable resources
so that this dependence (per unit of industrial output) gets cut in half
in 20 years through greater efficiency and a greater use of renewable resources,
and then keeps declining into the future.</P>

<P>* We improve agricultural technologies and particularly soil conservation
so that agriculture is less damaging to the land.</P>

<P>* We reduce pollution so that the pollution production rate per unit
of industrial output gets cut in half in 20 years, and keeps declining.</P>

<P><B>Consumption</B></P>

<P>* We limit the world's average industrial output per capita to a maximum
of about 80% of current Western European standards. It is important to note
that this limit is only on <I>output</I>, not consumer use. If, for example,
we make products that last twice as long, <I>the world could have an average
material standard of living about 160% of Western European standards</I>.</P>

<P><B>Population</B></P>

<P>* We make effective birth control methods available to everyone.</P>

<P>* The world's average &quot;desired number of children per family&quot;
becomes two.</P>

<P>* We increase the proportion of industrial output that is invested into
human services by about 50%.</P>

<P>All of these changes, even though they would involve significant cultural
and economic shifts, are well within our human capabilities. Given the stakes
involved, whatever difficulties these changes might involve would be a small
price to pay. The reward for doing them is clear. Population, food per capita,
and industrial output per capita all stabilize at reasonable levels, and
the human impact on the environment declines considerably.</P>

<P>Could we achieve a similar result by focusing on population growth alone?
To test this, I put an extreme assumption into the model: no births after
1995. Otherwise, all the assumptions were the same as for Figure 1. Figure
3 gives the results: </P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../../IMAGES/w3nb.gif" WIDTH="280" HEIGHT="197"
ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></P>

<P>Eventually (around 2060) food per capita and industrial output per capita
collapse completely because there are only elders left, and no more labor
force - about what you would expect from a world with no births! What I
find much more interesting, however, is that the collapse in food per capita
and industrial output per capita begin much earlier (around 2020), and for
the same reasons that drive the collapse in Figure 1.</P>

<P>In other words, <I>the people who are already alive today are enough
to drive the world to economic and social collapse if we keep on with business-as-usual</I>.
Even this extreme example of population reduction through birth control
is just too slow. A less extreme case, applying China's one child policy
to the world starting in 1995, produces results that are even closer to
Figure 1; indeed, the collapse is delayed by less than a decade.</P>

<P>Could technological change or limiting industrial output by themselves
do any better? The technological changes used for Figure 2 have the most
immediate impact, and delay the collapse the longest, but even these eventually
reach their limits. It looks as though <I>the whole package is necessary
to make a genuine transition to a sustainable society</I>. Of the three,
however, population control is the slowest in its impact. If we don't move
vigorously on changing to more efficient technologies and limiting our material
consumption, all our efforts on population control will be too little and
too late.</P>

<P>Another useful way of looking at this is with Paul Ehrlich's equation:</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>Impact = Population x Affluence x Technology</P>

<P>or I = PAT for short. What we can say with some certainty is that the
total human environmental impact is on an unsustainable path that will lead
to social and environmental collapse if we don't soon change the growth
patterns on the PAT side of the equation. Figure 2 shows how this could
be done, and Figure 3 shows that we can not rely on birth control alone,
even in its most extreme form.</P>

<P>Let's take this a step further by asking the fundamental population question.
Are there too many people? What is the Earth's carrying capacity for humans?
How much is enough? Figure 2 says that the Earth could sustainably support,
with a decent standard of living, about 8 billion of us - in other words
the Earth is not necessarily overpopulated now. In my reading of the population
literature, I find three underlying reasons for claiming that there are
already too many people:</P>

<P>* A factual disagreement on the Earth's carrying capacity. Assessing
this is far from easy, and depends heavily on what one assumes for the A
and T parts of PAT. There is lots of room for disagreement here, and it
is a topic that deserves increased attention.</P>

<P>* A desire to minimize the social and economic changes required to reduce
A and T. &quot;If <I>they</I> would just stop having so many children, I
could go on living in the style to which I am accustomed.&quot; As Figure
3 illustrates, this often unspoken, but nevertheless all too common attitude
is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the time scales involved.
Even the most extreme birth reduction will not eliminate the need for substantial
changes in A and T.</P>

<P>* An essentially negative view of the value of human life. Here we get
down to what may be an even more fundamental question: Can humans be a blessing
to the planet? For those to whom the answer is no, the fewer humans the
better. My own feeling is that one could well argue that today humanity
as a whole is not a blessing, but I see enough examples of people who <I>are</I>
that I can well imagine the balance shifting to the positive.</P>

<P>Are there too many people on the Earth? I would put it differently. There
is too much human impact, too much wasteful consumption, too many unloved
children, too many uncaring people, and too many powerful institutions that
reinforce uncaring and destructive behavior. History is forcing us to confront
these excesses and social failures now. Once we have done so, we will be
in a much better position to decide how many caring humans are enough for
the Earth.</P>

<H4>GETTING PERSONAL</H4>

<P>These issues are not just abstract policy questions; they are also very
personal. They hit home most profoundly in the question, &quot;Should I
have children?&quot; We've encountered a great deal of debate, opinion and
emotion (and generated some of our own!) on this pivotal personal question.
I'd like to share some of what I've learned out of this debate as another
illustration of the intricacy of the issues around population control.</P>

<P>Let's start with a sore spot in the culture: Many people who have chosen
to be childless, in part due to environmental concerns, feel unappreciated
by those with children. On the other hand, many parents (who are raising
those who will keep the society going as we all get older) feel unappreciated
by the childless. Both have a point, yet both, from my perspective, do more
harm than good when they argue that either voluntary childlessness or voluntary
parenting is, <I>in some general sense</I>, better.</P>

<P>Consider first the flaws in the notion, often unconsciously assumed in
our society, that every adult who can have children should do so:</P>

<P>* This idea is simply out of touch with historical reality. Most past
societies have had a significant minority of voluntarily childless adults.
Even as recently as 1920 in the US, 25% of women past childbearing age had
never had children. If we find this at all strange, it is simply that our
fragmented, nuclear-family-oriented society has lost its sense of history
and lost the web of relationships that used to keep childless aunts and
uncles still very much part of the family.</P>

<P>* In addition, concerns about overpopulation <I>are</I> legitimate, certainly
legitimate enough so that no one should feel an <I>obligation</I> to have
children just to keep the species going!</P>

<P>* Finally, many people can contribute much more fully to society without
carrying the burdens that parenting often imposes.</P>

<P>Does this then mean that we should invert the society's bias and uphold
childlessness as an ideal? Consider:</P>

<P>* As Figure 3 illustrates, even worldwide complete childlessness would
not avert the collapse to which business as usual is taking us.</P>

<P>* Society needs good parents and well-raised children.</P>

<P>* Making childlessness into an ideal sends a powerful anti-parent and
anti-child message - with far-reaching repercussions. In the US this is
already illustrated by the great rise during the 1980s in the percentage
of children living below the poverty line. We have tolerated this as a society
because we increasingly see children (especially other people's children)
as a burden, not a blessing. In other parts of the world the same attitude
is dramatically illustrated by the systematic killing of street children
in Brazil, and much more broadly, by the low priority given to the needs
of mothers and children. Ironically, low status for women and high death
rates for children are two of the key factors <I>driving</I> the population
explosion. So by sending out a &quot;too many people&quot; message we inadvertently,
yet significantly, contribute to a cultural climate that produces both more
rapid population growth and lower quality childhoods!</P>

<P>So is it better to have children, or not to have them? The question itself
is, I believe, wrong. There is no general answer. It all depends on who
you are. The environment can benefit from fewer children <I>and </I>from
well-raised children. There are selfish and unselfish reasons for both choices.
Only in the specifics of each person's life can any judgment be made. The
sooner we can celebrate the diversity that makes it good for one person
to choose childlessness and simultaneously good for another to choose parenting,
the sooner we will be able to get on with the real challenge of making the
changes throughout our society that will lead to a humane and sustainable
future.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Design For A Sustainable Economics</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by <A HREF="../../PEOPLE/RCGBio.htm">Robert Gilman</A></I></H4>

<P><BR>
Many of the articles in this issue have referred to the need to change the
way we approach economics and economic issues. That's a nice general thought,
but is it really possible to go from this recognition of the need to a practical
program?<BR>
<BR>
The good news is that not only is it possible, but many of the models needed
to demonstrate a more sustainable approach to economic life have existed
for years. At a conceptual level as well, the pieces for a practical and
positive alternative to conventional economics are falling into place.<BR>
<BR>
In this article I sketch out the key features of a sustainable economics.
Accompanying the article are descriptions of two models that illustrate
what some of the new institutions might be like.</P>

<H4><BR>
ECONOMICS IN CRISIS</H4>

<P>There have always been critics of the conventional, marketplace approach
to economics started by Adam Smith. Yet for more than 200 years it seems
to have worked - with some modifications and additions - remarkably well.
In the last two decades, however, it has become less and less effective
- to the point where economists speak of their profession being in profound
crisis.<BR>
<BR>
I see a parallel to this with the crisis in physics that occurred at the
beginning of the 20th century. Physics was then completely dominated by
the tradition started by Sir Isaac Newton - a tradition that had been brilliantly
successful in explaining most of the recognized physical phenomena of the
time. However, as physicists began to probe into atoms, Newtonian physics
just didn't work for the new experimental results. Out of that crisis came
the recognition that the Newtonian view of the world was too simple, and
the scope of physics needed to be expanded to include non-Newtonian theories
of quantum mechanics and relativity. Within this expanded worldview, the
rules of Newtonian physics now are seen as special cases that apply only
under certain limited conditions.<BR>
<BR>
I think that economics is now, relative to its own crisis, where physics
was in the first decade of this century: The failure of the theory is growing
more acute all the time, but the profession is still dominated by those
who are steeped in the old approach. A new approach is gaining strength
and supporters, but it is still a few years away from full recognition as
the legitimate successor.<BR>
<BR>
What is this new approach that may be on its way to becoming the &quot;new
economics&quot;? I will call my interpretation of it here &quot;sustainable
economics,&quot; although, as you might expect during a time of conceptual
ferment, there are many variations on the new approach and many names used
for them, such as green, holistic, ecological and real-life economics. <BR>
<BR>
To understand what sustainable economics is, and why it would be superior
to conventional economics, we need to start with a brief recap of conventional
economics. I'll need to go through a number of definitions and distinctions,
but this is far more than an academic exercise. The conventional economics
concepts I'll be describing provide the basis on which those in power all
over the world(which to some degree includes most of us in the rich industrialized
countries) justify the destruction of the Earth. It would be hard to find
a more pervasive, pernicious and powerful evil than the seemingly innocent
concepts that currently rule our economics lives. Let me be more precise,
for it is not so much the concepts on their own - they have served an historically
useful role. The real evil is the continued dominant use of these concepts
long after they have become seriously outdated and destructive. This is
indeed the belly of the beast, and until we can replace these concepts with
a more Earth-friendly approach, our prospects are grim.</P>

<H4><BR>
THE CONVENTIONAL PICTURE</H4>

<P>So let's plunge in, with the aid of the following diagram:</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../../IMAGES/3%265cap.gif" WIDTH="500" HEIGHT="695" ALIGN=
"BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></P>

<P>The top diagram gives the conventional picture (used across the board
by capitalists, socialists and communists alike) of the major factors involved
in economic activity. It begins with the three &quot;factors of production&quot;:
land, labor, and manufactured capital.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Land</B> was initially included in recognition of the importance of agriculture,
but as industrialization progressed it has been broadened to represent all
raw materials, like minerals and timber.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Labor</B> covers all direct human inputs into economic activity, although
in practice it has been treated largely as a simple head-count - e.g., how
big is the &quot;labor-force&quot; or how many unemployed.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Manufactured Capital </B>refers to buildings, tools, and equipment.<BR>
<BR>
The oval labeled <B>Economic Activity</B> stands for the process by which
Labor, with the aid of Manufactured Capital, converts Land (as raw materials)
into <B>Goods &amp; Services.</B><BR>
<BR>
Some of these Goods &amp; Services need to be <B>Invested</B> back into
the factors of production to either maintain or improve them. Whatever is
left over can then be <B>Consumed</B> to produce <B>Utility</B> or <B>Welfare</B>
for individuals and households.<BR>
<BR>
At first glance, this picture seems fairly reasonable. After all, it would
not have survived as the dominant view of economics if it was totally absurd.
Yet it misses many important facets of real economic life, and distorts
even those it does include. It will help, in understanding these deficiencies,
to compare it to the lower diagram.</P>

<H4><BR>
THE FIVE FORMS OF WEALTH</H4>

<P>This lower diagram is intended as a more realistic model of economic
activity. It begins by expanding the three factors of production into five
reservoirs of wealth. The concept of the first four I have taken from <A
HREF="#Ekins">Ekins</A>. The fifth I've added for completeness in this diagram.
In keeping with normal economic terminology, they are all called &quot;capital&quot;
but that does not mean that they are thereby reduced to commodities to be
bought and sold. But I'm getting ahead of my story; let's look more closely
at each of these forms of capital:<BR>
<BR>
<B>Environmental Capital </B><I>(EC) </I>expands beyond the idea of Land
to include all natural systems, such as the atmosphere, biological systems,
and even the sun. In recognition that these natural systems are more than
just inert &quot;resources&quot; the diagram includes Natural Systems Activity,
whose functioning depends on the quality of Environmental Capital and whose
results impact, for good or ill, Environmental, Human, and Manufactured
Capital, as well as directly on Human Activity. For example, sulfur dioxide
released into the atmosphere becomes part of EC. The Natural System Activity
of precipitation converts this sulfur dioxide into acid rain, acid rain
then adversely impacts lakes and forests (EC), respiratory health (HC),
and buildings (MC), among other things. In a similar way, the natural activity
of the sun produces both positive and negative impacts on EC, HC, and MC.<BR>
<BR>
Another aspect of the dynamic character of natural systems is that EC can
be self-maintaining and even self-building. Powered by the sun, EC can be
a long-term, continual source of enormous human benefit. EC is not locked
into a zero-sum game.<BR>
<BR>
One of the gross simplifications of the conventional picture is the idea
of free substitution between capitals, i.e., it really doesn't matter if
one of the three factors of production is depleted as long as another, of
equal or greater <I>price</I>, is built up in the process. The absurdity
of this becomes clear when the notion of Land is expanded to Environmental
Capital. Much of the real wealth in EC, such as the ozone layer or complex
ecosystems like tropical rainforests, simply can't be replaced by other
forms of capital. As we will see with the other four capitals as well, there
is some room for tradeoffs between them, but each is sufficiently unique
and vital that there are strong limits to substitution between them.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Human Capital </B><I>(HC)</I> expands beyond Labor to include quality
as well as quantity. According to Ekins &quot;Human Capital has three components:
health, knowledge and skills, and motivation.&quot; These three components
behave differently than material forms of wealth. First, within an optimal
range, all three of these are <I>enhanced</I> by use rather than worn down.<BR>
<BR>
Second, they all obey an economy of multiplication rather than an economy
of scarcity. That is, if I have a skill that I teach to you, I don't thereby
lose that skill, indeed my skill probably improves in the process. Similarly,
if I am healthy, that benefits, rather than taking away from, your health,
and if I am motivated, that will likely enhance the motivation of those
around me. The limiting factors for HC are not interpersonal competition
over the scarce resources of health, knowledge or motivation, but rather
they are limits imposed by time and, in many parts of the world, competition
over food, clean water, and other material supports for HC.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Social and Organizational Capital </B><I>(SOC)</I> recognizes a major
form of wealth that is ignored in the conventional diagram. It includes
all of the interpersonal &quot;software&quot; that enables societies and
organizations to function: habits, norms, roles, traditions, regulations,
policies, etc. - in other words, the non-physical part of culture. SOC is
different from HC in that HC is attached to a particular individual (you
can walk out the door with it) while SOC is transpersonal, and can remain
with an organization even though the individuals who comprise that organization
keep coming and going. On a broader scale, it includes law, government,
the feeling of community, the dynamics within families, as well as all art
and knowledge that have become part of the culture.<BR>
<BR>
Like the quality, or &quot;software,&quot; aspects of HC, SOC is generally
enhanced by use and is not generally diminished by sharing. There are certain
forms of knowledge whose <I>commercial</I> value is enhanced by keeping
it scarce or difficult to come by, but that is different from the question
of its overall value within the system. There are also many forms of SOC,
like language, that increase in value for each individual as they are shared
with more individuals.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Manufactured Capital </B><I>(MC)</I> includes, as in the conventional
picture, buildings, tools, and equipment. In this picture, however, the
idea of MC is broadened in two ways. First, the conventional practice is
usually to count as MC only equipment, etc., used by businesses. Thus a
stove in a restaurant is a tax-deductible business asset, while a stove
in a home is a &quot;consumer durable,&quot; not counted as capital. In
the new approach, the assets of a households are treated <I>on the same
footing</I> as the assets of businesses or other organizations. Second,
MC in the lower diagram includes anything physical that has been manufactured
and has not been returned to the environment, so it includes all kinds of
supplies and material as well.<BR>
<BR>
MC is the classic form of capital, and so it is the source of many of the
conventional ideas about capital. Some of these are that each object of
MC can be used in only one place at one time (it obeys a zero-sum economy
of scarcity), and MC always deteriorates, generally faster with use. As
a system, however, even MC has some of the self-reproducing qualities of
EC and HC. After all, it takes factories to make factories, so in practice
MC tends to grow exponentially, just like human population, if not limited
by other factors.<BR>
<BR>
The major limitations on MC are EC, at both ends of life. That is, at the
start of the life cycle of a manufactured object, EC can provide only a
limited supply of non-renewable raw materials, such as copper or oil, and
can sustainably supply only a limited flow of renewable materials, such
as wood. At the other end of the life cycle, as the object returns to the
environment as waste, natural systems are limited in their ability to assimilate
this output from MC, both in terms of the quantity and the quality of the
waste.<BR>
<BR>
It is crucial, in understanding the role of MC, to notice that the ultimate
value in MC lies in its <I>use</I>, not its production or disposal, and
yet frequently its use is the part of its lifecycle with the <I>least</I>
adverse environmental impact. Thus everything that can be done to prolong
the span of use between the initial extraction of raw materials from EC
and the eventual disposal back to EC, such as long-life designs, easy repair,
and good recycling, will enormously enhance the net value of MC within the
context of all five forms of wealth.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Credit Capital </B><I>(CC)</I> is another reservoir of wealth not included
on the conventional diagram, nor in Ekins' work. It is defined here as a
reservoir of credits and promises, so it includes money and debt, but not
stocks or deeds, which are ownership rights tied to other forms of capital.
Of course conventional economics is well aware of CC, but CC was left off
of the upper diagram because that diagram began its history describing only
physical flows. Only later did &quot;Goods&quot; become &quot;Goods &amp;
Services.&quot; The lower diagram includes both physical (e.g., MC) and
non-physical (e.g., SOC) quantities, so there is no reason to exclude CC
- and it certainly is an important aspect of real economic life! CC could
be considered as a special case of SOC (just as MC could be considered as
a special case of EC), but it is so important for economic understanding
that it has been broken out as a separate capital.<BR>
<BR>
Like each of the other capitals, CC has its own unique characteristics.
It makes a vital contribution to economic functioning for two reasons: First,
the lifecycle of humans (and many businesses too) is such that we need to
invest when we are young (in such things as education and housing), we can
produce more than we need to consume when we are middle-aged, and we often
need to consume more than we can produce when we are old. Thus we need a
mechanism to allow us to spread the concentrated productive capability of
our middle years to enable investment and consumption throughout life. Second,
many goods and services can deliver more value than they cost, both for
households and for businesses. Borrowing allows tapping that value to repay
the loan and still have a net surplus of value left over.<BR>
<BR>
Of course, that is not how borrowing always works. If the money is spent
on items that do not return a net surplus, then the future is burdened with
repaying the extravagance of the present. Another difficulty with CC is
that it usually functions as a means to transfer wealth to the wealthiest
members of society from everyone else (see sidebar). Thus the real value
of CC to the society as a whole depends on how it is used and whom it benefits,
as well as how much there is.</P>

<H4><BR>
ACTIVITY</H4>

<P>As in the upper diagram, these five capitals are blended together, in
various proportions, in support of some <I>Human Activity</I>. A new addition,
however, is the explicit recognition of <I>Time</I> as a limited resource
that must be allocated among various alternative activities.<BR>
<BR>
Another change is that the notion of &quot;economic activity&quot; has been
broadened here to <I>any</I> human activity. Does this mean that everything
is being reduced to economics? Hardly. Rather, it is the recognition that
every human activity has impacts on quality of life, on how we allocate
our time, and on the five capitals. Thus every human activity has an economic
<I>dimension</I>, and we can not expect to get a realistic picture of economic
life if we begin by categorically excluding any aspect of life.<BR>
<BR>
There are two flows that emerge out of Human Activity. One of these may
seem superficially like the Goods &amp; Services in the upper diagram, but
the content of the flow and the structure of the diagrams are significantly
different. First for content: the notion of Goods &amp; Services (i.e. only
intended results) is broadened in the lower diagram to recognize that wastes
and disservices are also a part of economic reality, whether we like it
or not. In addition, transfers are added to cover changes in CC and certain
exchanges among the other capitals.<BR>
<BR>
These <I>Goods, Wastes, Services, Disservices, &amp; Transfers</I> all flow
back to the five capitals. No longer is the stream broken into two parts
labeled Investment and Consumption with only Investment flowing back. This
is a major change in the structure of the diagram, and it is done for the
following reasons.<BR>
<BR>
The notions of Investment and Consumption as used in the upper diagram are
much too simplistic. For example, the upper diagram has no way of acknowledging
that consumption (as in the use of energy and materials) goes on as part
of the manufacture of goods.<BR>
<BR>
The lower diagram replaces these notions with the more complex, and more
realistic, notions of inputs and outputs from the various capitals. In this
picture, Investment and Consumption are not distinct categories, but can
be different aspects of the same activity. Consider eating. Let's assume
that the food is classified as EC (although some foods are more accurately
MC). The most obvious aspect of eating is the consumption of this food (output
from EC) as an investment in health and motivation (input to HC). In addition,
if the eating is done in a building, at a table, using dishes and silverware,
these forms of MC will support the activity (output from MC) and may undergo
some wear and tear (output from MC, input to EC). The peace and quiet (or
lack thereof) surrounding the meal will be greatly influenced by various
social norms (output from SOC), and the interaction during the meal may
affect the interpersonal relationships of those present (input to SOC).
Air quality (output from EC) will also affect the quality of the experience.
On top of all this, there may be some transfers of money (CC) involved.
Now tell me, was that meal an investment or was it consumption?<BR>
<BR>
Notice that not all outputs result in consumption (e.g., using social norms
doesn't &quot;consume&quot; them; on the contrary, using them usually strengthens
them). Nor can all inputs be classed as investment (e.g. toxic wastes input
to EC are at best a negative investment).</P>

<H4><BR>
QUALITY OF LIFE</H4>

<P>At the heart of the lower diagram is an oval labeled <I>Human Quality
of Life (QOL)</I>. There is a superficial correspondence between Utility/Welfare
in the upper diagram and QOL in the lower, but, as with Activity, the meaning
of the concepts and the structure of the diagrams around these elements
are significantly different.<BR>
<BR>
In both diagrams, these elements serve as the &quot;goals&quot; for activity.
That is, the assumption in the upper diagram is that people want to maximize
their Welfare. The parallel assumption in the lower diagram is that people
want to maximize their Quality of Life.<BR>
<BR>
As usual, the conventional concept is simple - too simple. Welfare is assumed
to be achieved by the indiscriminate satisfying of any and all human wants,
expressed in terms of the price paid for the goods or services, which, according
to the diagram, are the only contributors to welfare. Thus $1 million spent
on a private yacht is assumed to generate as much welfare as the same amount
spent on pre-natal care for thousands of children.<BR>
<BR>
The new approach recognizes that price is not the true measure of value
in supporting QOL. There are many aspects of this distinction between price
and value; let me describe two here. First, even if the marketplace functioned
perfectly in conventional terms, &quot;voting&quot; in the marketplace (which
sets prices) is on the basis of one-dollar, one-vote (biased toward the
wealthy), whereas QOL, based on human experience, needs values allocated
on a one-person, one-vote basis. Second, as the pre-natal care example illustrates,
unborn children (as well as the natural environment) have no direct voice
in setting today's prices, even when they bear the brunt of today's price-based
decisions.<BR>
<BR>
Developing a better measure of value require a deeper understanding of what
contributes to quality of life. One particularly illuminating approach has
been developed by Manfred Max-Neef, based on his experience with community
development in Latin America (see sidebar on Ekins' books on page 55). He
begins by creating a matrix of universal human needs and modes of experience,
and then looks at the many culturally dependent ways in which we humans
attempt to satisfy these needs. (<I>Being</I> refers to attributes, such
as health, self-esteem, passion, etc., most of which would be aspects of
HC; <I>Having</I> covers physical objects plus institutions, i.e., MC plus
some SOC and EC; <I>Doing</I> refers to actions, i.e. Human Activity; and
<I>Interacting</I> refers to locations and milieus, i.e., the context aspects
of MC, SOC, and EC). His matrix (without the &quot;satisfiers&quot; filled
in) looks like this:</P>

</TABLE>
<BR>
<BR>
The matrix can be used, for example by a community group, by filling it
in with various ways that each need is being or could be met.<BR>
<BR>
Of course, not all supposed satisfiers are equally effective or beneficial.
Indeed, one of the great strengths of this tool is that it allows those
who use it to compare alternative satisfiers to see which ones 1) are most
effective in what they intend, and 2) impact other needs, positively or
negatively.<BR>
<BR>
This matrix connects back to QOL in that <I>each</I> of these nine needs
must be adequately met in order for a person to have an adequate quality
of life. Another important aspect of many of these needs, like the needs
for food and rest as part of Subsistence, is that, while they are on-going,
they are not infinite. Other, more unbounded needs, like Understanding or
Creation, are limited ultimately by available time. In either case, they
are not best satisfied by attempting to consume ever increasing qualities
of goods and services.<BR>
<BR>
Contrast this rich description of the factors contributing to QOL with the
upper diagram where Utility/Welfare is contributed to <I>only</I> by Consumption.
In other words, the only way this picture allows humans to increase their
welfare is through destroying the subsequent usefulness of various goods
and services (i.e. consuming them), and what's more, the degree of welfare
is in direct proportion to the rate of destruction. I know that sounds silly,
but believe it or not, this diagram - complete with its assumptions about
consumption and welfare - forms the conceptual basis on which essentially
all major economic and economically-related political decisions are made
(or at least justified) <I>all over the world</I>. It is on this basis that
politicians proclaim their conviction that &quot;economic growth&quot; (i.e.
increases in the production of goods and services) is <I>the</I> key to
increasing human welfare.<BR>
<BR>
The structure of the lower diagram is very different, as are its implications.
In this diagram, <I>every</I> human activity has an experience associated
with it that the experiencers will assess as contributing to or detracting
from their quality of life, whether that activity is primarily productive,
consumptive, or neither. Even when the activity is in some sense consumptive
(as with the case of eating), the positiveness of the experience is affected
by many factors, not just quantity of consumption.<BR>
<BR>
Furthermore, Utility/Welfare is a dangling dead end, while QOL is an integrated
part of the system. The experienced level of QOL affects motivation (thus
the link to HC) and it affects the amount of Allocated Time devoted to this
activity.<BR>
<BR>
The conventional economist may well object at this point that, &quot;All
this talk about QOL sounds nice, but unless there is an objective way to
measure QOL, it is useless.&quot; There are two responses to this. At a
fundamental level, we need to see these alternative conceptual approaches
in historical perspective. Conventional economics was developed at a time
when the model for conceptual systems was Newtonian physics - simple, linear
chains of cause and effect that could be modelled with numerical precision.
Today, we understand that most of life - from biological systems, to climate,
to social systems -doesn't fit the Newtonian model. The leading edge of
theory now has to do with complex, highly interactive, highly non-linear
systems for which numerical precision is not possible. Nevertheless, simply
determining a good set of components connected by the appropriate feedback
loops to represent these complex systems can lead to great insight and useful
results. The old rule used to be, &quot;If you can't measure it, don't include
it.&quot; Today's rule is, &quot;Include elements on the basis of their
likely significance, not their measurability.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Having said that, the second response is that in fact there is a great deal
that can be objectively measured as to how well Max-Neef's set of needs
are being met, and thus the adequacy of QOL. Not necessarily with Newtonian
precision, but with enough statistical accuracy to be useful.</P>

<H4><BR>
PERSONAL APPLICATION</H4>

<P>To ground these concepts, let's look at how they can be used at a personal
level. Think of the major activities of your day. They could likely be put
into categories such as self-care (sleeping, eating, bathing, etc.), paid
work (including commuting and other associated activities), household activities,
recreation, shopping, and so on. Each one of these activities 1) takes time,
2) draws on the five capitals, 3) has impacts back on the five capitals,
and 4) affects your experienced QOL.<BR>
<BR>
Let's assume that your goal is to maximize your on-going QOL, while also
minimizing any adverse impacts on any of the five capitals. Achieving this
goal (or even coming close!) requires a complicated balancing act. <BR>
<BR>
The lower diagram can reflect this while the upper one can't. Consider,
for example, the time you spend on paid work. According to the lower diagram,
it would be &quot;rational&quot; for you to choose a job that</P>

<UL>
  <LI>provided direct job satisfaction (input to QOL)
  <LI>placed you in a healthy environment with clean air and water (output
  from EC, input to HC)
  <LI>didn't depend on non-renewable resources or unsustainable use of renewables
  (draining output from EC)
  <LI>minimized pollution and other negative inputs to EC
  <LI>gave you opportunities to learn (input to HC)
  <LI>had a low level of stress and other hazards to your health (avoiding
  negative inputs to HC)
  <LI>had a sufficiently orderly social structure so that you could efficiently
  focus on your own task (output from SOC)
  <LI>enabled you to participate in shaping the organizational routines and
  culture (input to SOC)
  <LI>provided you with good tools in a pleasing and efficient building (output
  from MC)
  <LI>paid you enough to cover your expenses in the rest of your life (CC).
</UL>

<P><BR>
The lower diagram says that all these things (and more) need to be taken
into consideration as you pursue your goal. The upper diagram takes a much
simpler approach: the only purpose of having a job is to earn money so that
you can consume goods and services when you are not on the job. From the
conventional point of view it is not &quot;rational&quot; to consider anything
other than the amount you are paid. From the new point of view it is not
rational to consider <I>only</I> what you are paid. Which approach seems
more realistic to you? Which approach is reflected in the great bulk of
our laws, institutions and cultural assumptions?<BR>
<BR>
We can take this comparison even further. In the model represented by the
lower diagram, it would be perfectly rational for people to reduce their
need for income by living as efficiently as possible within their household,
and then to use this reduction to allow them to work under conditions that
provided more direct QOL and/or required less time in paid work. Furthermore,
it would be perfectly rational for a society as a whole to facilitate all
of its members to do this, developing new social and economic institutions
if necessary. The net result would be an <I>increase</I> in per capita QOL
accompanied by a <I>decrease</I> in the production of goods and services
(which is measured by the Gross National Product).<BR>
<BR>
Such a decoupling of QOL and GNP is impossible in the conventional view.
As you can see from the diagram, maximizing Utility/Welfare implies maximizing
Consumption, which implies maximizing the production of Goods &amp; Services
- there is no other way.</P>

<H4><BR>
THE ROAD AHEAD</H4>

<P>This is just one example of the profoundly different conclusions that
follow from these two views of economic reality. We need to do more, however,
than just explore these concepts in principle. To put them into practice
will require, as best as I can tell, more movement in three main areas:<BR>
<BR>
<B>Indicators</B> - If we are to give full and equal importance to each
of the five capitals, we need good measures, good indicators, for each.
We need to be able to track the changes in both quantity and quality for
each, and have ways to make comparisons between them. Much work has been
and is being done around the world on developing such indicators, and this
work needs now to accelerate. These indicators will give us a better way
to keep score.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Rights and Responsibilities</B> - A second part of giving proper importance
to each of the five capitals is clarifying our legal relationships to them.
The world has begun this process relative to its environmental commons,
but from the perspective of sustainable economics, the whole range of &quot;ownership
rights&quot; needs to be reassessed for each of the five capitals. This
reassessment will give us a new framework within which to play the economic
game.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Institutions</B> - Finally, to actually play the economic game in a sustainable
way, we need to create institutions consistent with this framework. I've
offered the Mondrag&oacute;n Cooperative Group and the JAK banking system
(see sidebars) as examples of the kinds of institutions we need to establish
on a much broader scale. Fortunately, there are many other such examples.
We have decades of good work to build on. <BR>
<BR>
Let's get on with it.<BR>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Ekins"></A>Real-Life Economics</H2>

<P>I've drawn considerable inspiration for this article from two recent
books authored and edited by Paul Ekins: <I>Real-Life Economics: Understanding
Wealth Creation</I> (coedited with Manfred Max-Neef; NY: Routledge, July
1992) and <I>The Gaia Atlas of Green Economics </I>(with Mayer Hillman and
Robert Hutchison, NY: Anchor Doubleday, February 1992). Both books cover
the same general territory, but <I>Real-Life Economics</I> is addressed
to a professional and academic audience while <I>The Gaia Atlas of Green
Economics</I> is more popular in its presentation.<BR>
<BR>
Paul Ekins, a Research Fellow at the Department of Economics, Birbeck College,
University of London, is a co-founder of The Other Economic Summit (TOES).
He is also Research Director for the Right Livelihood Award, and the founder
of the Living Economy Network.<BR>
<BR>
His two books draw very effectively on this background to present the best
overview of green economics that I have seen anywhere. I highly recommend
them.<BR>
</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><HR></P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Interest-Free Banking</H2>

<P>Could a banking system work without charging interest to borrows and
paying interest to depositors? A non-profit association in Sweden, known
as JAK, has been doing it successfully for more than 20 years. When I first
found out about them, I was rather skeptical, expecting that they did it
through some kind of hidden subsidy, but as I've studied their system I've
been delighted to find that, rather than some trick, they do it through
a genuine social invention.<BR>
<BR>
The heart of their invention is this: Rather than operating as a bridge
between two classes - borrowers and lenders - JAK expects the borrowers
and lenders to be the same people, but at different times in their lives.
Thus JAK requires every borrower to save, over and above repaying their
loan, as much and for as long as their loan.<BR>
<BR>
If I borrow $10,000 for 10 years, JAK won't charge me any interest (although
they will charge me a modest fee), but, in addition to gradually repaying
the $10,000, I must gradually save enough so that I have a positive balance
of $10,000 at the end of the 10 years. I won't get any interest on this
savings, but I can withdraw it once I have fully paid off the loan.<BR>
<BR>
My savings provides the funds which others can borrow, just as the interest-free
savings of others permitted me to borrow. It is profitable for me to do
this because the combined loan payments and required savings are still less
than the normal loan payments plus interest of a regular bank, plus, I get
all my savings back!<BR>
<BR>

SWEDEN.<BR>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><HR></P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Mondrag&oacute;n Cooperative Group</H2>

<P>I had the good fortune to spend a week in Mondrag&oacute;n, Spain, this
March, studying what many people feel is the world's most successful group
of employee-owned, democratically-controlled businesses. I had read, and
written, about them for years, so I knew they were remarkably successful
in conventional business terms: This group of over 160 coops, with a total
of over 23,000 worker-members and over $3 billion in sales in 1991, has
been consistently more productive, more profitable and faster growing than
surrounding businesses since its start in 1956. During that time they have
had essentially no layoffs (even when local unemployment was over 25%) and
more than 95% of their business start-ups have succeeded.<BR>
<BR>
What I hadn't fully appreciated before I went was that Mondrag&oacute;n
is also a surprisingly pleasant place to live and work. In addition to their
great business record, the coops have far better safety and environmental
records than surrounding businesses. The community itself (of about 27,000)
is designed so that everyone is within easy walking distance of green fields
and woods.<BR>
<BR>
Mondrag&oacute;n is a model of what is possible when businesses and communities
choose to take a whole-system approach that balances the roles of all five
capitals in the interest of a sustainable quality of life.<BR>
<BR>
There are some clouds on Mondrag&oacute;n's horizon, mostly due to the competition
they feel from huge multinational corporations, but I expect they will weather
these challenges as well as they have the many in their past.<BR>

<BR>
Many threads are coming together to suggest that the community scale will
be a major focus for cultural change in the coming decade:<BR>
<BR>
u There is a growing awareness that the root causes of most environmental
problems are over-consumption of resources and excessive production of waste
in the industrialized world. Much of that consumption occurs at a community
level, especially in the ways we house and transport ourselves. Significant
relief for the environment won't come until we transform our communities.<BR>
<BR>
u Large institutions - especially businesses and governments - are losing
touch with the grass roots. They are becoming less effective, less responsible,
and more self-absorbed. Because of this, more and more people are realizing
that it now makes better sense to look to community-scale organizations
for the support and security they used to expect from large institutions.<BR>
<BR>
u At the same time, many people are feeling an increasing hunger for the
warmth, support, and rich human experience that is found only in community.
We are being pulled as well as pushed to community.<BR>
<BR>
For all these reasons, the wisdom and desirability of revitalizing and transforming
our community life seems clear. The challenge, however, is getting there,
for community transformation requires:<BR>
<BR>
u confronting and redirecting the enormous momentum (in our institutions
and in our daily habits) that has produced our over-consumptive and alienated
society, and<BR>
<BR>
u cooperating - in substantial ways and over the long haul - with a wide
spectrum of people, a skill which, for many of us, is a bit rusty.<BR>
<BR>
Fortunately, there are many pioneers who have shown that it can be done,
indeed it can be done joyfully. In this issue, we visit some of these pioneers
and look at how to build on their accomplishments and experiences.<BR>
<BR>
This issue also marks a milestone in the life of our small &quot;community&quot;
here at Context Institute. Alan AtKisson, whose skillful editing during
the past four years made a major contribution to <I>IN CONTEXT's</I> development,
moved on to other interests in July. We wish Alan well as he continues to
work for a humane and sustainable future through his work with Sustainable
Seattle and in other venues.<BR>
<BR>
And we welcome Sarah van Gelder, who joined us in mid-August as <I>IN CONTEXT's
</I>new managing editor. We all feel she has done very well in quickly coming
up to speed with this challenging (some would say daunting) task. (See p.

<BR>
<I>Communities all over are finding themselves in serious trouble. Municipal
budget shortfalls and unemployment are just two of the many symptoms of
fundamental shifts in the economic underpinnings of the US and the world.
Many people feel powerless to make a difference; communities face the large
scale alienation of their young people; and the groups that are supposed
to be helping often are working at cross purposes. <BR>
<BR>
While there may not be any easy answers to these challenges, a community
that taps the creativity of its members and gets people to start cooperating
on projects - however small - is in the best position to build anew. And,
with the combined strengths of all segments of the population, this could
lead to more sustainable and humane communities!<BR>
<BR>
Jeff Bercuvitz is among the pioneers of this approach. He can be reached
at Community Innovations, PO Box 190, S. Strafford, VT 05070, 802/765-4662.<BR>
<BR>
</I><B>Robert: </B><I>Could you describe, in broad terms, the kind of approach
that you take in communities?</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Jeff: </B>I work with communities in the United States and Canada that face
a range of economic, social, and environmental challenges. Not only does
that create the necessity for taking more creative approaches to problem
solving, but it creates an opportunity to develop solutions that are more
sustainable. That is, they're not solutions predicated by outside infusion
of financial assistance, but they're based rather on a spirit of creative
initiative and leadership within communities, and the willingness of the
people to take charge of their own destinies. <BR>
<BR>
The crucial building blocks in any kind of community empowerment effort
are bringing people together and building their sense of possibility through
concrete action. In my experience, the more we do and the more we discover
our ability to have an impact, the more we discover that we have the power
to deal with the long-term fundamental challenges we face.<BR>
<BR>
I find a lot of support on all different parts of the traditional political
spectrum for this approach. Certainly people who are concerned about environmental
and social justice issues can find common ground with our work. At the same
time, since we have a strong emphasis on community self-reliance and on
enterprise, we get the backing of people who might traditionally not be
supportive of the types of concerns we work on. <B><BR>
<BR>
Robert: </B><I>How would you typically begin working in a community?</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Jeff:</B> Generally we get involved when a community faces some particular
challenge, some kind of division. Environmental people and business people
aren't getting along or even talking to each other; blacks and whites are
having some conflict. When we're invited in, we try from the outset to bring
a broad range of civic, religious, environmental, and business groups together.<BR>
<BR>
I make a distinction: when people ask if I'm a community organizer, I say
no, I'm a community builder, perhaps even a community animator. The derivation
of the word animator is <I>animare</I>, which is Latin for &quot;make more
lively, move to action.&quot; My work is essentially to help draw out and
enliven the spirit of the people and of their place. <BR>
<BR>
So in order to help draw out that spirit, replenish that spirit, in some
cases help build that spirit, we take a five-step approach: <I>think big
- start small, take stock of your assets, have fun, just do it, and ripple
out.</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Robert: </B><I>Could you elaborate on those steps?</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Jeff: </B>The first step is to <I>think big - start small</I>.<B> </B>For
readers of <I>IN CONTEXT</I> I'd like to say that that's not the same as
&quot;think globally, act locally.&quot; The idea is that it's important
to help people build momentum and get over a hump of inertia by just doing
something. And, starting small can help to build bridges. <BR>
<BR>
I'll give an example. There's a group in San Anselmo, CA, that wanted to
give some input on downtown revitalization efforts, particularly with an
eye to sustainability and environmental concerns. These people were perceived
by the Chamber of Commerce types as old hippies, and their input was unwelcome.
<BR>
<BR>
Well, this group decided to start small and do something that was, in and
of itself, good for the community. They started a compost give-away program,
knowing that a lot of the people who had gardens and would likely benefit
from the compost were those very same power brokers involved with the downtown.
Not only did they help deal with a local waste problem with their composting
- and help spur local gardening and small-scale food production - but they
had a chance to meet face-to-face over a mound of compost with people who
had seen them as strangers and adversaries. They built a relationship, and
from there they were able to move on to the downtown revitalization effort.<BR>
<BR>
Thinking big while acting small is particularly important now, because sometime
around the 20th anniversary of Earth Day we crossed a certain threshold.
Prior to that, most of our discussions had to do with large-scale institutional
change, and governmental and - to some extent - corporate responsibility.
<BR>
<BR>
I think that around the Earth Day event we went too far in the other direction
- to an ethos of &quot;Forty-nine ways to save the planet while slimming
your thighs or trimming your tummy.&quot; There's no sense at all of how
to connect those small steps with the big picture. There's no sense that
there is institutional responsibility and a need for larger systemic change.
So the message that I think is really important for us to work on is to
reconnect the small steps with the big picture. The small steps are crucial
to getting people going, boosting confidence and building bridges, but they
are not enough in and of themselves. <B><BR>
<BR>
Robert: </B><I>It's also a matter of building the momentum of success.</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Jeff: </B>That's right. Also important for success in terms of <I>thinking
big </I>is to cultivate and articulate a broad vision that weaves together
environmental concerns with people's economic, social, and spiritual concerns
- and some of their personal pain as well. <BR>
<BR>
For example, participants in the Sunshares Project in Durham, NC, a few
years ago wanted to get more recycling going in their community. Instead
of launching a &quot;recycling initiative,&quot; they launched a &quot;community
economic development project.&quot; They got 24,000 households participating
and increased the amount of recycled material from 60 to 480 tons.<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps most exciting and most important, they helped spawn 1,000 block
coordinators and 29 full-time employees. And those block coordinators are
now working on weatherization and water efficiency as well as recycling.
That was a good example, I think, of a reframed initiative, where they were
able to make some of the connections. <BR>
<BR>
There are a number of environmental initiatives that are now doing that
- reframing themselves as sustainable economic initiatives. <BR>
<BR>
Your readers may be familiar with a Wilderness Society report, <I>The Wealth
of Nature</I>, which focused on the greater Yellowstone ecosystem. Instead
of just arguing for the importance of environmental integrity, this report
demonstrates how more jobs are dependent upon - and created by - a healthy
ecosystem than by extractive industries. So by talking in economic terms,
they're reaching out to a broader range of people.<BR>
<BR>
I'm focusing on the importance of reframing issues as one key part of <I>thinking
big</I>. And it's not that people necessarily need to think in economic
terms. There are land preservation initiatives, particularly around urban
areas, that have been reframed as community-building or educational efforts.
<BR>
<BR>
One good example would be the Intervale Community Farm in Burlington, VT,
where not only do they have a subscription farm on land that they were trying
to preserve, but they have a program for court-referred youth to work on
composting; they do outreach to older people in the community; they use
the facility as a business incubator for agricultural-related ventures;
and they have parties and special events on the land.<B><BR>
<BR>
Robert: </B><I>So it's not just that the whole-system approach is, in some
moral sense, better; it's also that taking that approach leads to a much
higher chance of success and on-going sustainability.</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Jeff: </B>That's exactly right. And sustainability is the key word because,
if we don't have a broad range of people involved, we won't have sustainability
either of effort or of political support.<I><BR>
<BR>
Taking stock of your strengths </I>is the next step, and that goes right
to the core of my work, which is to help people discover how they can make
better use of everyone and everything to enhance their community's vitality
and sustainability.<BR>
<BR>
For those interested in theoretical constructs, an important part of taking
stock of a community's strengths is to know that there are certain internal
resources in a community. These are goods, in the broadest sense of the
term, that are either free or have been paid for once, and other things
we already have: skills, land, maybe money, and so on. Then there are also
what are called external inputs, which we have to purchase.<BR>
<BR>
A good way to explain it is in the context of a farm system. There is a
whole range of available resources, including sun, water, nitrogen, minerals,
energy, and seed, and in most cases, the farmer can decide whether to use
an external resource, such as synthetic fertilizer, or an internal resource,
like nitrogen-fixing plants.<BR>
<BR>
The point is not to forgo all sources of outside help, but to make sure
that external inputs are introduced in such a way that they do not unnecessarily
diminish the value and vitality of the internal resources. And there are
a lot of resources already in our communities that we can draw on; for example,
we can involve younger people, instead of defining them as problems. <B><BR>
<BR>
Robert: </B><I>Can you give me some specifics on how you get a group of
people to take stock of its strengths?</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Jeff: </B>I often have community members compile an &quot;associational
map,&quot; which lists the formal and informal groups that could participate
in a revitalization effort. <BR>
<BR>
A fascinating example came up last week when I was in Alberta. One of the
participants in the workshop - a leader of a native reserve - said, &quot;Oh,
you know, we don't have any groups in our community that we can draw on.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
He met with three other people to brainstorm about who gets together now
in the community, and how these &quot;groups&quot; can be used to meet the
community's goal: job creation. They talked about young people who get together
and drive all-terrain vehicles, which seems to the adults to be a terrible
nuisance. And then his eyes lit up, and he said, &quot;Well, maybe we could
work with the young people to set up a rally; maybe we could work with them
to run trail tours.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
That ties into the next tool, which is to develop a &quot;People Pages,&quot;
a list of skills and abilities that different people have. <BR>
<BR>
Older people are one of our greatest untapped resources. One way, among
many, that older people can help their communities and themselves is to
share their wealth of knowledge about their community's history. And that
history can sometimes give some clues as to what can be done today. There
have also been successful efforts developed to make use of the business
acumen of retired business people.<BR>
<BR>
Financial resources are also important to take stock of; it's important
to see where the money is coming from and where it's going. It's also critical
to work on import substitution, to keep more dollars re-circulating in the
local economy.<BR>
<BR>
So, I guess the broad point is that we have a lot of assets that we fail
to see; we just miss them right before our eyes. <BR>
<BR>
The third step is <I>have fun!</I> I believe that unless one's efforts to
improve the world replenish oneself, those efforts are not likely to be
sustainable over time.<BR>
<BR>
It's particularly important if we're trying to reach out to other people
and get them involved, that there's something in it for them. I usually
encourage groups not to have meetings but to have parties. Serve food -
it's as basic as that if you want to have people turn out. My motto is,
&quot;When in doubt, celebrate.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
One group decided to do what they really enjoyed, which was bicycle riding.
They invited some other people to ride with them, and then they started
community &quot;Bike to Work Days.&quot; This became a major event in Boulder.
The critical mass of people who were biking became a potent political force
with enough clout to push for bike lanes, bike paths, and other amenities
for bicycles. Now several other communities are putting bike racks on the
sides of buses. Those larger efforts, which are so important for the sustainability
of our communities, often grow out of activities that somebody just likes
to do.<B><BR>
<BR>
Robert: </B><I>Right.</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Jeff: </B>The next step would be <I>just do it. </I>Often times when there
is something we want to do, we set up a task force or we call someone to
ask permission. I'm a big believer in the importance of taking direct initiative
and not giving someone else a chance to just say 'no.' <BR>
<BR>
There are myriad examples of such efforts. Carolyn Morrison, who lives in
San Francisco, had to walk by a place called Hooker Alley, a trash-strewn
lot filled with bottles and so on. <BR>
<BR>
Every so often someone would call the city and say &quot;clean it up!&quot;
and the city would clean it up. But it's almost a law of physics that as
a trash-strewn lot is cleaned up, a vacuum is created that sucks more trash
back into it. So that's not a sustainable solution in any sense of the term.<BR>
<BR>
The next suggestion was to build a fence. It may have been unsightly, but
it had one salutary effect - it created a new recreational opportunity in
the community: Trash Put, where people would throw their trash up over the
fence.<BR>
<BR>
Well, when Carolyn Morrison looked at this lot she imagined a community
garden with younger and older people of different ethnic backgrounds gardening
together. <BR>
<BR>
When I was talking about <I>thinking big</I>, I skipped over the importance
of coming at problems from the side, but this woman was clearly coming at
the problem from the side. Instead of asking, how do we clean up this lot,
she did something that not only solved an immediate problem, but created
something even better. She asked a few of her young neighbors to help clear
out some of the rocks and clean up the trash. Then she talked to some mostly
older people, who didn't have space to garden, and they just planted a garden.
<BR>
<BR>
This was a key part of SLUG, the San Francisco League of Urban Gardeners,
which produces 500,000 pounds of food a year, much of which they make available
to homeless shelters and sell to finance seniors' activities. So it was
a wonderful example of thinking big, but also taking direct action, rather
than just throwing one's arms up in despair.<I><BR>
<BR>
Rippling out,</I> the fifth step, means, for example, asking a neighbor
or friend to bike with us, as they did with &quot;Bike to Work Days.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
An example that comes to mind is the &quot;Daily Bread&quot; project. A
woman named Carolyn North wrote a letter to the editor of the local paper,
saying that she wanted to deliver food from local restaurants - fresh food
that would otherwise be wasted - to local food shelters. A couple of people
got in touch with her, and they contacted some restaurants and phoned more
people. Soon, they'd started a terrific program that later grew to include
stores, bakeries, and so on. <BR>
<BR>
Then they started a gleaning program to gather some of the fruit that would
otherwise fall off the trees and go to waste. This <I>rippled out </I>further
still, and they started a farm that - besides producing food - became an
educational center.<BR>
<BR>
Now this isn't to say that one just urges individuals to do things and crosses
ones fingers. There's a lot we can do within our communities to spur this
kind of action.<B><BR>
<BR>
Robert: </B><I>Can you give me some examples?</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Jeff: </B>Well, one can create an umbrella under which people can do small
things, but feel connected with each other. Some communities give awards
for community improvement efforts, or offer mini-grants or technical support
to people who want to take some initiative to enhance social and environmental
well-being. <BR>
<BR>
At Community Innovations, we work on building a foundation for ongoing community
improvement efforts. We can help people build bridges to other groups, build
a spirit of enthusiasm, and get a sense of their own power by actually accomplishing
specific tasks. <BR>
<BR>
These efforts don't claim to solve long-term problems. But we believe communities
can only tackle the bigger problems if a broad range of people sense that
they can do something and are willing to work together. The good news is
that this process is starting to take place in communities large and small,
urban and rural, black and white, throughout North America.<BR>

<H2><CENTER><A NAME="Walking"></A>WALKING FOR A CHANGE</CENTER>
</H2>
<I>Having fun is one of the five steps Jeff Bercuvitz uses to enliven community
spirit. Ethel's story, as told by Jeff, illustrates the connection between
having fun and sustainable community building efforts - and it shows how
people we might not think of as leaders can surprise us.</I><BR>
<BR>
I was in a depressed community giving a talk, and a woman approached me
afterwards and said, &quot;I'd love to do something to enhance the vitality
of this community, but I don't know what to do. I don't have a lot of energy,
I'm tired, and I'm 82 years old.&quot; She said, &quot;I'm not really sure
what sacrifices I can make at this point.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I said to her, &quot;I'm not suggesting that you look for sacrifices; I'm
asking a different question. What do you enjoy doing, and is there some
way you can build on what you already enjoy to enhance the vitality of your
community?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
And she said, &quot;Well, I like to walk but I don't see what that's going
to do for my community.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
So I said, &quot;Well, how about this? Next time you go for a walk, you
might consider going with a few friends and perhaps take some younger people
along as well.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Now, normally I would not be suggesting that she recruit others and take
a walk. Instead, I would have a small group identify what they enjoy doing
and brainstorm with each other. Usually things like that will come out from
within the community. But in this case it was not so much a work moment,
it was a moment of saying 'Thou' (as Martin Buber would use the term) to
a person in front of me who was expressing a plea of uncertainty as to what
she could do. <BR>
<BR>
I got a call from Ethel about four weeks later and I had to scratch my head,
not certain of who she was. She reminded me, and I asked her how she was
doing. <BR>
<BR>
She said, &quot;Well, I'm doing very well. I just wanted to let you know
that I went for that little walk we talked about.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Well, that's great. Did you enjoy it?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Oh, yes, I did. And I just wanted to let you know that I've just started
my community's first intergenerational walking club and boy, am I proud!&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
And I thought that was wonderful and it would end right there. <BR>
<BR>
But I got a call several weeks later from her and she said, &quot;Hello
Jeff, this is Ethel. We've been walkin' and talkin', and a lot of the young
people love the stories that the older people are telling them, and the
older people feel wonderful. But we realize there are a lot of people in
our community who are older, who would have a lot to share but who don't
walk or can't walk, and so we've started an oral history project to involve
them as well. Just thought you would want to know.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
And I thought well, that's really great, and that's probably where it's
going to end. <BR>
<BR>
And then I got a third and final call from her, I think six weeks later
or so saying, &quot;Hello Jeff, this is Ethel.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;How are you doing, Ethel?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Oh, I'm just doing wonderfully! We've been walkin', we've been talkin',
we've been doing our oral history, and we've been discussing how it is very
gray downtown, which is so depressing, and there's no greenery, no life.
It used to be such a beautiful place, but all the trees were destroyed either
by road salt or by disease, some by the bulldozers, and so we've now started
a tree-planting and community greening campaign.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Well, that's really wonderful! Tell me, with all this activity, how
are you feeling; are you feeling tired?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Oh, I haven't felt so energized in years.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
That story for me contains a lot of important lessons. First, that community
building need not involve sacrifice; in fact, personal regeneration and
community regeneration must go hand in hand. <BR>
<BR>
Second, there are a lot of people who can do very important things for our
communities, whom we would never think of as community leaders and whom
we might not now be tapping. <BR>
<BR>
And finally, one can't necessarily know what good will come from some kind
of small community action. We must create spaces for these small scale,
spontaneous, wonderful, somewhat anarchic initiatives; not everything of
value in life comes directly from a strategic plan.<BR>

<H2><CENTER><A NAME="Hope"></A>HARVESTING HOPE IN GREENFIELD, IOWA</CENTER>
</H2>
<P><CENTER><I>by Matt Holland</I></CENTER>
<P>It's hard now to remember just how bad things got for small farmers during
the 1980s, but Ed Sidey will remind you. <BR>
<BR>
As publisher and one-man news staff for the Adair County (Iowa) Free Press,
Ed watched Greenfield, the county seat, slipping into depression. Farms
were sinking into foreclosure, and the economic ripple was taking down some
retailers too. Alcoholism rates were up in the town of 2,000. A few teenagers
committed suicide, and others wanted to move away.<BR>
<BR>
Several dozen farmers protested at the US Department of Agriculture offices
in Greenfield; they got a lot of press coverage, but no help. After compiling
a list of 14 pressing community needs, leaders discovered that no one at
any level of government could or would help them. Then, in February 1987,
they invited Jeff Bercuvitz to town.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;He was kind of the cheerleader type, almost like a gospel preacher,&quot;
Ed said. Jeff, then the director of the Rodale's Regeneration Project, called
a meeting in a church basement. Instead of listing problems and needs, he
had the 80 citizens who showed up listing their assets. They came up with
110 good things about Greenfield, and participants soon found themselves
celebrating &quot;open space&quot; instead of cursing &quot;abandoned roads.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Jeff encouraged the group to build on those assets, but to start small.
The first project was a &quot;People Pages,&quot; a directory of skills
and products available in Adair County, from crocheting to fixing old clocks
to translating German. The exercise gave the Greenfielders a sense of their
wealth, which they had lost sight of amidst all the messages about their
problems and poverty.<BR>
<BR>
Morale started snowballing. A &quot;Kids' Dreams&quot; project revealed
that what the town's young people wanted most was a skateboard park. They
built one, with little assistance from adults. A father and daughter started
planting marigolds through town; a crumbling gas station was replaced with
a &quot;mini-park&quot;; and the owner of the local grocery store printed
all his bags with a message: &quot;If you can think of anything which could
be done to improve the community using locally available resources, go ahead
and do it and phone this number ....&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Many of the projects in that first year didn't have much economic impact,
Ed said, but they gave people confidence. People who hadn't done much in
the past turned out to be born leaders. <BR>
<BR>
A year after Jeff's visit, the citizens voted 72 percent in favor of a bond
issue to be used to build a new high school. And in 1989 the newly-formed
Antique Preservation Association opened an aircraft museum. With volunteer
help, the old hotel was refurbished and reopened; a couple of bed-and-breakfasts
were also started up. Wednesday night socials on the courthouse lawn were
revived, and a farmers' market started to take advantage of the crowds.<BR>
<BR>
Not everything has panned out, Ed admits. The agriculture committee's idea
for processing locally-raised cattle into canned beef chunks was unable
to withstand fierce supermarket competition. And the old hotel is closed
again. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Outside of that, the bed and breakfast seems to do quite well, and
the museum has had a steady increase in visitors,&quot; he said. And the
weekly courtyard social gatherings have contributed to a revitalization
of the downtown, which recently has seen a series of new shop openings.<BR>
<BR>
Of course, farming is still not doing well, and tourism is not going to
single-handedly save Greenfield. But town residents believe the new school,
a new reservoir, and the planned airport expansion will create a good climate
for new business. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We are surviving,&quot; Ed said, while other farm towns have not.
&quot;The most important benefit was the change in community attitude. When
we refocused on positive activity, we were reinventing our spirit.&quot;<BR>

<H4><CENTER><I>an interview with Sharif Abdullah, by <A HREF="../../PEOPLE/RCGBio.htm">Robert
Gilman</A></I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
I walk into the center of the large room. Surrounding me is a ring of 50
chairs, 46 of them occupied by white male road workers, engineers and animal
control workers, experiencing varying degrees of hostility, denial and avoidance.
Baseball caps pulled down over their eyes, arms folded over beer guts: I
stand before the epitome of blue-collar America. With the exception of my
co-facilitator, I am the only black person in the room.<BR>
<BR>
They have been ordered by their managers to spend four hours with me as
I facilitate a discussion on the changing ethnicity in our society and on
building community within the work force. I have been hired to help a group
of strangers, with whom I share little in common and who feel coerced into
participation, to move toward community. In four hours. <BR>
<BR>
In order for this not to become an exercise in absurdity, I have to know
in advance the barriers to community and to get beyond those barriers -
quickly.<BR>
<BR>
I first talk about change, and fear of change. That we all experience fear
- fear for our jobs, our lifestyles, our family. (Some of the arms unfold,
some eye contact.) I then talk about guilt and denial, how we feel these
things when faced with the possibility of change. I tell them that I want
none of them to feel guilty about being in a system they did not create.
(More eye contact, some nods.) <BR>
<BR>
I follow that up with a discussion of &quot;white male bashing,&quot; how
the men in the room feel defensive because they are threatened and blamed
for all of society's problems. (By this time most of them are sitting forward,
making eye contact, smiling to each other and ready for the first exercise.)<BR>

I've spent 20 minutes talking, and the only thing I've said is, &quot;I
know how you feel, and your feelings are valid. I know you are afraid, but
together we can get through the fear.&quot; In 20 minutes, we broke through
the essential barrier to community: fear. The essential roadway through
that fear is compassion. <I><BR>

- Sharif Abdullah<BR>
<BR>
Sharif Abdullah is director of The Forum for Community Transformation (PO
Box 12541, Portland, OR, 97212),</I> <I>an organization that is working
on the changes necessary to bring about an &quot;authentic society.&quot;
His description of his first meeting with the road workers was reprinted,
with permission, from the July 1992 issue of </I>Talking Leaves.<I> In addition
to consulting and speaking, Sharif writes about values, personal and cultural
transformation, and empowerment; his book, </I>The Power of One<I>, is available
from the Forum. </I>IC<I> editor Robert Gilman interviewed Sharif during
his recent visit to Bainbridge Island. </I><B><BR>
<BR>
Robert: </B><I>When are you called in to a work place, as you were with
the road maintenance workers?</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Sharif: </B>Let me give you an example: I was called into a situation where
the work crews were calling each other by derogatory racial names. They
were best of friends, they would get along with each other, go and visit
each other, or go fishing together, but the white crew members would call
the black crew members &quot;nigger&quot; or &quot;boy,&quot; the black
ones would refer to the white ones as &quot;cracker&quot; or &quot;honky,&quot;
and then they would all go get doughnuts together. <BR>
<BR>
Now, into that mix came a temporary worker who instantly fell into the same
behavior, started doing the name calling and the back slapping. The temporary
worker was not given a permanent position and used three months worth of
name-calling incidents as proof that he was &quot;discriminated against.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
So, generally there's a smoking gun: an incident has cost an employer time
and/or money, or the conditions are present for one to occur. An incident
can cost a county or a city hundreds of thousands of dollars in lost time,
bad feelings, damage claims and awards. The idea is to pay a fraction of
that for preventive maintenance. <B><BR>
<BR>
Robert: </B><I>How do you respond to this type of situation?</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Sharif: </B>When we get called in, we ask three questions. <BR>
<BR>
The first question is, What really works well for everybody, that we need
to either leave alone or strengthen? <BR>
<BR>
The second question is, What doesn't work for everybody or for a significant
number of people? We help remove the cultural supports for that kind of
behavior. <BR>
<BR>
The third question is, What needs to be added to this culture to make it
work well for everyone? If we take out one behavior, then perhaps we need
to put a new behavior in its place. By looking at these three things we
start re-orienting or re-directing the cultural basis for the work place.<BR>
<BR>
Most of the cultures of various workplaces were created back when the only
people in the work place were white males, so that one cultural group set
the tone. That is beginning to change. <BR>
<BR>
In the past we've tried to make changes from the top down, at the level
of institutions, without recognizing that the institution rests on the bed
of culture, and culture rests on the bed of consciousness. An example is
affirmative action: we pass laws, set up guidelines, have statistical reports,
etc., but there's no <I>cultural</I> support for bringing more ethnic minorities
and women into the work place. So when ethnic minorities and women arrive
on the job, there's resistance and hostility because the cultural work hasn't
been done. We're doing the cultural work first. <B><BR>
<BR>
Robert:</B><I> How do you get started? How do you build connections to workers
who aren't interested in participating and are most likely quite defensive?</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Sharif: </B>The first training is mandatory for the entire work force. When
they come in they are at best defensive and suspicious, at worst, openly
hostile. We have about 20 minutes or so to reach them, and we do reach them.
We reach them because we walk in with our hearts open; we walk in without
blaming anybody. <BR>
<BR>
We use an analogy of a toxic waste dump. We don't know who created the dump,
we just assume that no one in the room created it. However, we inherited
it and we have a choice to either pass it on to our children or drain it
ourselves. Each of us has a responsibility for draining it.<BR>
<BR>
We talk about the profound societal shifts we are all facing and tell them
that if they don't bog down in fear, it will be okay. Their jobs may change,
their whole lifestyle may change, but it can be okay, it can be something
that they will look forward to. And it's worth the shift for their children
and their children's children. That's something they really understand.
<B><BR>
<BR>
Robert: </B><I>So once you have a basic level of trust established, where
do you take it from there?</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Sharif: </B>We call our process an &quot;emergent awareness process&quot;;
we help them emerge to their next level of awareness. <BR>
<BR>
First,<I> </I>we refer them back to themselves. They love making broad statements
about what George Bush ought to do. We turn the discussion back to them.
That's how we get them to face that they do have a fear - that when they're
talking about George Bush, it's generally masking some fear.<BR>
<BR>
Secondly, we refer them back to the common good. We'll ask them what would
be good for everybody present. They'll say, &quot;Well, what's good for
me and my friends is <U>x</U>.&quot; And we say, &quot;No, what's good for
absolutely <I>everybody </I>here?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Thirdly, we refer them back to their values. We don't try to tell them what
those values are, but we do ask them to clarify those values.<BR>
<BR>
I'll give you an example: a few of the crews take their lunch to the nearest
high school, and while they are eating they look at the high school girls
walking by in their mini-skirts and make inappropriate comments. All of
these are grown men with teen-age children. <BR>
<BR>
I say to them, &quot;If your daughter came home from school and said, 'Daddy,
there's this guy in this truck who is saying suggestive things to me,' you'd
go to your closet and load up your .38 and you'd blow someone away for doing
what you do.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Now, you should get your values consistent, because if what you do
is okay, then when your daughter comes home and says that, tell her to go
ahead and get in the truck. If you're not willing to tell her that, then
perhaps you shouldn't be doing that to somebody else's daughter. Now you
resolve the conflict any way you want to.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Our society is schizophrenic. We espouse one set of values and practice
a completely different and contradictory set of values. We need to end the
schizophrenia by ending it within ourselves first.<BR>
<BR>
Fourth, we refer them back to a healing environment so that they can be
challenged without feeling blamed and defensive and angry. It's okay to
push them out of their comfort zone, and we do that very quickly. We push
their buttons really hard. But it's <I>not</I> okay to push them out of
their safety zone. Some of them have a joke after each session: they'll
come up and shake my hand and say, &quot;I hated this. And thanks a lot,
I'll be back.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The last thing that we refer them back to is a sense of their own spirit.
What we're trying to do is to evoke the highest level of transpersonal experience
that they can muster. Some of them don't have a belief in anything other
than their grandkids. They say they'll do <I>anything </I>for their grandkids,
in which case they're ready to talk about closing a nuclear power plant,
for example. <B><BR>
<BR>
Robert: </B><I>What's at the root of the problem? How did these work place
cultures get to the point that they need this intensive therapy?</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Sharif: </B>The problem is ultimately that our entire society is made up
of people who don't feel good about themselves. These road workers are at
the bottom of that ladder, in a very literal fashion. When you walk through
sewers every day, or operate a sweeper, or pick up trash on the side of
the road, you recognize that the work that you're doing is, in the words
of Wendell Berry, fundamental and inescapable. In the past we called that
work &quot;nigger work.&quot; And they know people look down their noses
at them.<BR>
<BR>
If you feel bad about yourself, how do you learn to feel good about yourself?
What we're taught is to put someone down; if there's someone lower than
you, you're okay. I started an interview with one of the workers by asking,
&quot;You're a utility worker.&quot; He said, &quot;I'm a <I>utility worker
two</I>.&quot; That means there is a <I>utility worker one,</I> who's lower
than he is, and he wanted to make sure he's not the lowest person on the
ladder. <BR>
<BR>
The racially and sexually motivated joking or comments are simply attempts
by people who don't feel good about themselves to get a leg up. If we learn
to feel good about ourselves without putting someone else down, the behaviors
that we've been lumping into the -<I>isms</I> - racism and sexism - can
go away. <BR>
<BR>
So I find myself in the very rare position of doing self-esteem work primarily
with white males. I never thought I'd be doing that. I had always thought
that white males were at the top of the ladder, that they've got it all
together. Now I realize that there is no top to this ladder.<BR>
<BR>
On the one hand, these men are white, they've got good jobs, job security,
they can buy anything they want, live anywhere they want. But on the other
hand, they're caught in a machinery that they don't understand, that they
haven't created, and that they can't affect. So each of us is in some way
a victim of the society that we have created, and in some way a victimizer.
<BR>
<BR>
The road workers see the society going like a car out of control. They know
simplistic answers don't work, but no one is providing any other answers.
<BR>
<BR>
Activists aren't talking to these people, the people that I call the center,
or the majority. They talk to people who are already saved, preach to the
choir. The dominant paradigm is dominant because there's no one articulating
to those who are upholding it that there's any another paradigm. <BR>
<BR>
It's amazing what happens when we talk to the road workers about what we
call the &quot;authentic society,&quot; and about the mega-crises, and about
the values we need to create a new society, and what that new society might
look like. The heads around that room are nodding, you know, it's like &quot;yeah,
this is the first time I've ever heard this.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
One of the guys came up to me after one of these presentations and said,
&quot;You're talking to the same group of people that David Duke is talking
to, and what you're saying makes sense. We know that David Duke is trying
to use us.&quot; <B><BR>
<BR>
Robert: </B><I>What skills do you need to facilitate these sessions? </I><B><BR>
<BR>
Sharif: </B>You have to be willing to work on your stuff in the room in
front of people and be vulnerable. You can't afford to get defensive because
they can detect it. It's like smelling fear or anger; they go after you.
<BR>
<BR>
Here's an example of a time my buttons got pushed. One of the guys raised
his hand and said, &quot;The white man is an endangered species.&quot; I
said something to humor him and just kept on going. About five minutes later
he raised his hand again and made a similar kind of statement, and I just
turned him off, and he raised his hand a third time and said, &quot;You're
not listening to me!&quot; And I said, &quot;You're right!&quot; And I said,
&quot;I'm going to stop, and I'm going to listen to what you've got to say.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
And what he said was what you said in one of the issues of <I>IN CONTEXT</I>
about the center not being okay (see <I>IC</I> #30, page 10). His language
wasn't as clear and lucid as yours, and he had these racial buzzwords in
there that set my bells off. But basically he said we can't work for the
right of a particular group when all of us are in the same boat right now
- everybody needs help. And he's right. When I was able to let go of my
stuff and stop and listen to him, I was able to say to him, &quot;You're
absolutely right. And now I can help you to articulate that in such a way
that people can listen to it and not think that you're Bozo the Clown.&quot;<B><BR>
<BR>
Robert: </B><I>Can you describe other discussions you had during these sessions
with the road workers?</I> <B><BR>
<BR>
Sharif: </B>Okay. This is the 2 am session with the night road workers -
interesting group of folks. We were talking about what had happened since
the last training. One of the workers said about a manager who was there
in the room, &quot;I noticed that Henry is treating the black workers better
than he did before.&quot; And then he turns to Henry and he says, &quot;But
you know, I noticed that you're treating <I>everybody</I> better. And I
really want to thank you for doing that. You're treating the black folks
<I>and </I>the white folks better.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Now, Henry, of course, starts turning red. Henry had a very military style,
and he thought that you get the maximum amount of work out of someone by
making them feel as badly as possible. That may have been the first unsolicited
praise he ever got! That was a very powerful lesson for everybody in the
room. <BR>
<BR>
It's fun stuff. And very rewarding. They have been increasingly willing
to expose their inner selves. Anyone who's been through a community-building
process knows that this is a powerful, scary, and in some ways a threatening
process. <BR>
<BR>
One time, one of the men just broke down and started crying, bawling. My
initial reaction was to run over and comfort him. But I stopped that reaction
because the men needed to see another man cry and see that it's okay. That
moment knit the group in ways that it could not be knit before. The man
who cried displayed tremendous courage by exposing himself to potential
ridicule. Creating an environment where that was safe is the kind of work
we do.<B><BR>
<BR>
Robert:</B> <I>It sounds as though this process would change the workers
in their non-work lives also.</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Sharif: </B>That's right. One guy told me that he had had a black family
living next to him for 10 years, and he had never spoken to them. After
he did our training he went next door and spoke to them. He said it shocked
them. But they got over their shock, and now they're speaking to each other.
<BR>
<BR>
This guy fits all of the definitions of what a black person would be afraid
of from a &quot;white racist.&quot; For him to go next door and introduce
himself to that family helped to make the entire world a safer place. He
took a chance and stepped outside his normal role, which was to ignore them,
to act like the house was vacant. Speaking to them meant he was willing
to accept a change in his life. <BR>
<BR>
Another one of the road workers told me that he had talked all weekend about
this with his wife and that he's treating her differently now because of
the training. <B><BR>
<BR>
Robert: </B><I>Tell me about your background. What brought you to the point
where you're doing self-esteem work for white men?</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Sharif: </B>I'm not quite sure where to begin. I was born and raised in
the Philadelphia area, in a fairly monotonous, impoverished background -
welfare, toxic environment. The environment was toxic because it was polluted,
but also because it was socially polluted. <BR>
<BR>
I first started looking at issues of community and empowerment when I was
about 12 or 13 years old, when I got involved with the Black Power movement
in Camden, New Jersey. At 12 years old I was one of the founding members
of an organization called the Black People's Unity Movement. We did economic
development and self-help projects, like creating a supermarket, a corrugated
box factory, a gas station. <BR>
<BR>
We had all of these economic activities going on, and we had a sense of
political power in the city, but at the time I was an alcoholic, and most
of the people in the organization were either doing drugs or alcohol. There
was an emptiness inside of us, a lack of fulfillment, a torment. So, despite
the economic activity, despite having a deep sense of our cultural roots
as African people, we were still killing each other, or ourselves. <B><BR>
<BR>
Robert: </B><I>How did you get out of that situation? What changed for you?
</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Sharif: </B>I get asked a lot what changed me from a relatively hard-hearted
young man, who didn't care about himself and surely didn't care about anybody
else, into a person who can be compassionate with everybody and almost everything,
including the ants on the ground. There wasn't a moment of epiphany when
I realized I was one with all of life; it was a gradually evolving process
in which I came to recognize that that which I was angry about was something
I was fearful about. And when I addressed and faced that fear, I could walk
through it and come to another room that was larger than the room I left.
<BR>
<BR>
The first fear I had to face was the fear of white society in general. Being
raised almost exclusively in a black environment, where all of the faces
and images coming at me were African-American, created a fear of white society.
Now, in my mind I interpreted that as dislike for white society; I couldn't
admit I was afraid. So facing that fear for me meant being able to, for
example, attend a predominantly white college and survive. <BR>
<BR>
The next fear was the fear of people who had more resources than I did.
Being raised on welfare meant the people who were even middle-class were
foreigners to me; there was a lot of distrust and fear around being put
down. What I learned through experience was that middle- and upper-class
people have the same kind of fears, the same kind of issues that I have.
<BR>
<BR>
So each time I had to face a fear, what I really had to do was face a level
of who I was as a person. Each step revealed another part of me and allowed
me to encompass a broader reality.<B><BR>
<BR>
Robert: </B><I>Out of all of this, what did you learn about the empowerment
process? </I><B><BR>
<BR>
Sharif: </B>From doing work with the road workers, I've come to see that
the group that we are trying to empower is the middle, the majority, the
center of gravity for our society in North America. It's those who unwittingly
support the dominant paradigm. <BR>
<BR>
We want them to be empowered so they can move in the direction of an authentic
society - one that is based on compassion, that is sustainable, that is
ecologically in balance, and that works for everybody. <BR>
<BR>
We also want them to be empowered so that they don't move in the other major
direction of our society, which is fascism: cutting the corners off of life
to get it to fit into a preconceived notion of how people should think,
act, and behave. <BR>
<BR>
People move when you make a direct appeal to their hearts, when you engage
them at their level, on their issues, and you do that with a sense of your
compassion. As Thich Nhat Hahn [a Vietnamese Buddhist monk] says, it's easy
to be compassionate with someone whom you consider to be a victim; it's
harder to see the victimizer as the victim. I have come to look upon the
people I've been dealing with as victims of a system that all of us support
in some way, and all of us are victims of in another way. <B><BR>
<BR>
Robert: </B><I>You mentioned earlier that you talk to the road workers about
the mega-crises we face. Can you say more about that?</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Sharif: </B>In my book, <I>The Power of One: Authentic Leadership in Turbulent
Times</I>, I examine five mega-crises that are facing everybody on our planet.
These crises have to do with the economy; diversity - the fact that everyone
on the planet is facing an issue in regards to how we see ourselves in relationship
to some other person or some other group; ecology; human fulfillment; and
leadership. <BR>
<BR>
If I have a sense of my personal power and authenticity, those five directions
manifest themselves into a coherent whole. <BR>
<BR>
With regard to economy, I get to practice voluntary simplicity; I get to
look at the world and say, this is a level of economic activity that I choose
for myself and that I can live with. In terms of diversity, it means that
I can truly honor everyone else's path. <BR>
<BR>
In regard to ecology, I can practice transpersonal ecology: instead of looking
at humanity as being the top of a food chain and everything else being subservient
to humans, humans are just part of the web of life. And I will treat all
of that life in a sacramental way. <BR>
<BR>
In terms of looking at fulfillment, I ask: what does it mean for me to live
a fulfilling life? What do I need from myself, what do I need from others,
what do I need from my society, in order for me to live a value-centered
life? - to live a life that has value and meaning outside of how much money
I make or what kind of car I drive. <BR>
<BR>
And in terms of leadership, I have to be a leader of <I>one.</I> The reason
that the title to my book is <I>The Power of One </I>is that I believe that
if I fully encompass my authority, I become an empowered person. When I
rid myself of fear of others or fear of consequences or fear of how I'm
seen by others, I become a very powerful person. When everyone acts this
way, we've created a <I>society</I> that is empowered. <BR>
<BR>
I don't know what a society that is based on compassion or authenticity
looks like. We have very few models of that in the world. But we get to
find out; we get to experiment with having competition between nations as
to who can do the most good for the planet. Instead of who can sell the
most arms, who can help the most people feed themselves? <BR>
<BR>
It ushers in a brand new era, a brand new way of thinking about and dealing
with things. We're out of a reformist mode. <BR>
<BR>
It's interesting that many people in our society, even people who consider
themselves progressives or activists or whatever, still buy into the inherent
value of the existing paradigm. What we have been talking about is truly
revolutionary. We're talking about a major shift in how we see our society.
It's the kind of shift that Newtonian physics had hundreds of years ago.
It's a brand new ball game.<B><BR>
<BR>
Robert: </B><I>It's a shift at the level of consciousness and culture.</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Sharif: </B>Yes. And our ability to <I>cooperate</I> with it just by saying,
'Yes, it's going to happen, I'm not going to stop it,' is going to spell
the difference as to whether we're in for a 20-year exciting roller coaster
ride or 20 years of pain and anguish. And I'm up for the roller coaster
ride.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>Building The Movement</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Robert Gilman</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
As the articles in this issue illustrate, the 1990s provide communities
with major new opportunities, daunting challenges, and growing urgency.
In this article I'd like to draw some of these threads together and look
at how community-based action could be helped and supported.
<H4><BR>
ABUNDANT OPPORTUNITIES</H4>
At the same time as the institutions and habits of our society have grown
more out-of-touch with our emerging environmental, social, and economic
reality, the opportunities for genuine improvements have grown substantially:<BR>
<UL>
  <LI><B><I>Energy and Resource Use</I></B><I>. </I>The San Jose and PG&amp;E
stories (see pages 13 and 50) illustrate a start toward what is possible.
Technologies that permit 1) the efficient use of energy and other resources
and 2) enable the switch to renewable and nontoxic resources have improved
rapidly in capability and cost-effectiveness, and promise to keep doing
so for many years to come. Moving to these technologies is one of the best
win-win opportunities currently available to communities.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI><I><B>Land-Use and Transportation.</B> </I>The current land- use patterns
of 1) single-use zoning and 2) giving first priority to automobiles over
other forms of transportation have done much more than give us long commutes,
congestion, and pollution. They have also profoundly eroded our connections
to our neighbors and thus gutted the foundation of community life.<BR>
<BR>
Communities now have the opportunity to gain major interconnected benefits
by introducing multiple-use zoning; this would enable people to reintegrate
home, work, and shopping in a single neighborhood, and support biking, walking,
and other non-automotive forms of transport<BR>
<BR>
  <LI><B><I>Social Institutions.</I></B><I> </I>The revitalization of community
grows out of and provides rich social interaction. One important dimension
of this is the interaction between children and seniors. The story of Ethel
(see page 19) provides a glimpse of what is possible. A richer community
life could also provide support for all kinds of life-long learning, such
as study circles (see page 22).<BR>
<BR>
And, just as much can be done with energy efficiency, there are &quot;social
technologies&quot; that are more efficient (economically as well as socially),
such as using mediation instead of litigation for dispute resolution. Indeed,
any community that is willing to set aside the goal of individualistic isolation
will discover a rich array of social changes that can improve quality of
life, often reduce costs, and simply avoid many current social problems.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI><I><B>Economic Life.</B> </I>The old idea of gaining the economic
&quot;good life&quot; by competing with other communities to get some big
corporation to put a factory in your community is looking pretty hollow
these days. Instead, it is growing clearer that economic vitality <I>and
</I>resiliency come from a high percentage of locally owned businesses and
from a low dependence on outside sources for such basics as food, energy,
and capital. There are a wide range of proven techniques, from micro-enterprise
lending (see page 32) to the development of Mondragon-type cooperatives
(see IC #32, page 58), that can be used at a community level.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI><I><B>Synergies</B>. </I>Many of the benefits from these opportunities
build on and enhance each other. For example, as the San Jose story illustrates
(see page 13), one of the most successful community economic strategies
is to improve our environmental behavior through more efficient use of energy
and other resources. There are also many ways in which social improvements
have beneficial economic repercussions.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI><B><I>We're all in this together.</I></B><I> </I>In the decades since
World War II, &quot;community development&quot; has been primarily seen
as something to assist economically disadvantaged groups (in rural communities
and in the inner cities). This assistance was supposed to help these groups
&quot;keep up&quot; with the rest of an otherwise individualistic society.
It was all part of a charity model that assumed, &quot;The center is OK;
we just need to tidy- up around the edges.&quot; Our society's commitment
to even this kind of community development has been, at best, uneven.
</UL>
<DL>
  <DD>But by now two things are clear:
  <DD><BR>
  <DD>1) While these efforts have certainly helped to soften some of me
disparity in the society, they have not succeeded in altering the underlying
systemic structures that generated the stark disparities in the first place.
  <DD><BR>
  <DD>2) The center is not OK. The public has, understandably, lost faith
in the big centralized institutions of government and business. The individualistic,
consumerist society that these large institutions have supported and encouraged
is no longer the gleaming goal it used to be. Indeed, more and more people
are seeing it as me root of the problem and something we <I>all </I>need
to learn how to leave behind. We now have the opportunity to focus on the
needs of the <I>whole </I>community, opening up new possibilities and garnering
a much deeper level of support <I>for </I>and <I>from </I>the whole community.
</DL>
<BR>
This list is not meant to be complete, but already it shows how broad the
opportunities are for substantial - and beneficial - change.
<H4><BR>
DAUNTING CHALLENGES</H4>
Yet the promise held up by these opportunities is at least matched by the
difficulty of the challenges facing communities:<BR>
<UL>
  <LI><I>Social Disintegration. </I>Much of the fabric of community life
is already badly worn, if not shredded. In addition to such dramatic evidence
as the LA upheaval, a quieter, but equally worrisome, example is that the
time most people spend either in a car by themselves or watching TV is much,
much greater than the time they spend talking to a neighbor or otherwise
participating in any kind of community life.<BR>
<I><BR>
</I>
  <LI><I>State and Federal Regulations. </I>While there is much that communities
can do within the framework of existing legislation, there are also many
areas in which existing legislation, at best, works at cross purposes to
constructive local action. For example, all the hidden subsidies for the
automobile (see page 8) make it difficult for communities to develop sustainable
transportation systems.<BR>
<I><BR>
</I>
  <LI><I>Globalization and Rapid Change. </I>As the world's economies get
more closely tied together, me economic fate of many communities is controlled
by distant events and distant institutions. The proposed new General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) would introduce even more control at the global
level. As the pace of global change keeps growing communities will find
it harder to plan or engage in any kind of long-term projects.<BR>
<I><BR>
</I>
  <LI><I>Economic Restructuring and Shrinkage. </I>Many of me opportunities
listed above require investment, but there seems to be precious little &quot;economic
surplus&quot; available these days as our economy moves painfully through
a profound reorganization.
</UL>
<BR>
It is important to avoid overblowing the power of these difficulties, for,
as many of the previous articles illustrate, there are often creative ways
that local communities can deal with them. Some can even be turned into
assets. For example, any community whose public life is sufficiently satisfying
and engaging to out-compete TV can tap the huge resource of human time now
spent in front of the tube.<BR>
<BR>
Nevertheless, the process of constructive community change has never been
easy, and making these changes in me 1990s promises to be as challenging
as ever.
<H4><BR>
TIPPING THE BALANCE</H4>
Is there anything we all can do to give communities a better chance? In
the race to build a humane and sustainable society before business-as-usual
drives us to collapse, is there any way we might be able to tip the scales,
improve the odds, for communities?<BR>
<BR>
The history of successful community development efforts provides an encouraging
yes. It seems that the paradoxical key to successful decentralized action
is often a broad-based infrastructure of support services that can assist
and cushion each local unit, plus undertake research and other activities
that no local unit could afford.<BR>
<BR>
The Mondragon Cooperatives provide a wonderful example. This group of over
160 employee-owned and democratically run businesses in the Basque region
of Spain has 23,000 worker-members and had over $3 billion in sales in 1991.
Many people feel they are not only the world's most successful group of
cooperatives but also the most successful example of grassroots community
development.<BR>
<BR>
A major key to the success of these cooperatives is their group of second-level
cooperatives: the bank, the research institute, the business development
group, and various schools and training centers. These second- level cooperatives
have enabled the primary cooperatives to survive through more than 30 years
of good times and bad with fewer than 5 percent business failures and essentially
no unemployment, even when the society around them had over 25 percent unemployment!<BR>
<BR>
The same story is evident in the high success rate of businesses started
in incubators (see page 33).<BR>
<BR>
Another example of support services that have had far-reaching impacts is
the US Department of Agriculture's Extension Service. I'm not enthused about
many of the policies promoted by the Extension Service, but I think we need
to recognize that the combination of research and teaching at Land Grant
universities and the outreach work of local Extension Agents was remarkably
successful at transforming US agriculture.<BR>
<BR>
These examples suggest that, if we really want the movement toward more
humane and sustainable communities to succeed, one of the highest leverage
actions we can take is to create what I would call &quot;Community Transformation
Services&quot; to provide various kinds of assistance to those in local
communities who are on the front lines of the community transformation process.<BR>
<BR>
Fortunately, there are already many support services and support organizations
that deal with one aspect or another of the community transformation process,
as many of the previous articles have illustrated. Yet as far as I know,
there is currently no organization or group of organizations that 1 ) have
the full vision of community transformation and 2) are providing support
services to communities to help them implement that vision.<BR>
<BR>
Such an organization or group of organizations could fulfill many roles,
such as:<BR>
<UL>
  <LI><I>Integrated Referral and Resource Clearinghouse. </I>At the present
time there is no single place a community can go to find assistance and
information on economic <I>and </I>environmental <I>and </I>social development.<BR>
<I><BR>
</I>
  <LI><I>Whole-systems Training. </I>Many of the best opportunities today
make use of synergies between economic, environmental, and social issues.
Local leaders will be able to tap these more effectively if they are not
always having to reinvent the process. Good training programs could quickly
bring them up to speed.<BR>
<I><BR>
</I>
  <LI><I>&quot;Tool&quot; Creation. </I>Those who are pursuing a whole-systems
approach to community transformation are likely to find that currently available
books, videos and other such &quot;tools&quot; aren't enough. They will
need an organization that can respond to their specific needs by creating
appropriately customized materials.<BR>
<I><BR>
</I>
  <LI><I>Communications and Networking Support. </I>A lot of useful learning
will be taking place in communities all over the world. With the right kind
of communication system between communities, this learning can spread rapidly,
easing and accelerating the process.<BR>
<I><BR>
</I>
  <LI><I>Clearinghouse for Legislation. </I>While the main focus of activity
needs to be at the local level, there will be various state and federal
legislative obstacles to be removed and opportunities to be seized. At the
least, there needs to be a clearinghouse that can be an interface between
communities and the various specific lobbying organizations that focus on
particular topics.<BR>
<I><BR>
</I>
  <LI><I>Community Transformation Extension. </I>There may well be a role
for various consultants who would be the equivalent of community transformation
extension agents. An appropriate service organization could help to train,
coordinate, and perhaps even certify these consultants.
</UL>
<H4><BR>
MAKING IT HAPPEN</H4>
Let's take a moment to step back and look at the big picture:<BR>
<UL>
  <LI>The root material cause for much of the environmental damage going
on around the world is wasteful over-consumption in the industrialized world,
of which the US is a prime example. This over- consumption occurs in, and
is often structured into, our communities. We won't be able to build a sustainable
future until we transform the way we live in our communities.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Much of the root psychological cause for our over-consumption comes
out of personal insecurities and ignorance of alternatives, both of which
are encouraged by our present individualistic, competitive, and alienating
society. We won't be able to deal with these psychological issues without
simultaneously transforming the character of our community life.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>The highest-leverage way to encourage the community transformation
process is to develop appropriate support services.
</UL>
<BR>
But if community transformation and the support services for it are such
a great idea, why aren't we, as a society, already doing it? In part, of
course, some of us are already doing it, but not nearly enough. In part
we aren't doing it because people have only recently come to the broad whole-system
understanding on which this argument rests. Yet perhaps most of all, we
aren't doing it because it is a form of &quot;investment for the common
good&quot; and our society has difficulty even recognizing, much less supporting,
the common good. In very practical terms, we aren't doing it because we
have not yet figured out how to adequately fund it.<BR>
<BR>
There is, however, considerable hope that me community transformation process
can get past this all- too-familiar roadblock. As the San Jose story points
out, hidden in most communities today is an enormous economic resource of
current wasteful spending practices - on the order of hundreds of billions
of dollars for the US as a whole, as the hidden costs of driving illustrate
(see page 8).<BR>
<BR>
To the extent that the community transformation process can tap that resource,
by improving community efficiency, and then use some of the resultant savings
to fund further community transformation efforts, community transformation
should be able to become a self-financing process. I like to think of such
a self- financing community transformation process as a beneficial &quot;social
bacteria&quot; that can live off the waste in the current system. The support
services could be financed on this same basis.<BR>
<BR>
But it takes time for savings to accumulate, and it takes investment to
get the savings started. While some of this investment can be obtained through
conventional sources, including electric utilities (see page 50), a crucial
part of the process will need startup support from foundations and individuals,
like you and me. The support services, especially, need far-sighted funders
who understand the high leverage these can have in accelerating the community
transformation process.<BR>
<BR>
WHAT WE'RE DOING<BR>
<BR>
Here at Context Institute we believe strongly in me value of me community
transformation process and have been doing all we can to promote it, including:
<UL>
  <LI>covering many topics of importance to community transformation through
<I>IN CONTEXT<BR>
</I><BR>
  <LI>continuing to research sustainable community developments around me
world<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>working with organizations like the American Institute of Architects
and me YMCA to move them more broadly into me community transformation process<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>working with the Global Action Plan organization to develop me Household
EcoTeam Program, a six month program (now active in me US, Canada, England,
Germany, me Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden) to help groups of households
move toward environmental balance - and build community in me process<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>working with the Swedish Institute for Social Inventions and Rocky
Mountain Institute's Economic Renewal Program to start development of a
Guide to Resources for Community Transformation<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>starting work on a Sustainability Audit as a self- assessment tool
for communities, especially geared to help identify opportunities to move
in a more sustainable direction - and save money in me process.
</UL>
<BR>
It is our intention to keep doing what we can to act as a catalyst for me
community transformation movement within our limits of time, human energy,
and funds.
<H4><BR>
WHAT YOU CAN DO</H4>
There are many ways for you to participate in this process as well:<BR>
<UL>
  <LI><I>Get involved with your community. </I>This is the heart of the
whole process and me area that needs the most involvement. Start a study
circle, go for a walk, join an EcoTeam, ...<BR>
<I><BR>
</I>
  <LI><I>Provide products or services that help the process. </I>Whether
through a business or as part of a nonprofit* organization, whether locally
or on a broader scale, orient your work or your volunteer efforts to community
transformation.<BR>
<I><BR>
</I>
  <LI><I>Support organizations that are working for community transformation.
</I>Even though most such organizations have a more specialized focus man
we described here, community transformation needs all me help it can get.
Help them to expand their vision, and give them the support to do so.
</UL>
<BR>
Over the next few decades, the transformation of industrial society into
a humane and sustainable culture is a very real possibility, but we won't
get mere unless we give it our best effort now.<BR>
<BR>
Join us in making it real.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>The Next Great Turning</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Robert Gilman</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
<BR>
Interconnectedness is an idea whose time is coming. Like sustainability,
the momentum of history is gathering around it.<BR>
<BR>
What do I mean by interconnectedness, and why is it important? In this issue,
we're using the term to refer to the various ways each of us is part of
an on-going exchange of material and information with the world around us.
It means recognizing that we - like all of Earth's life - depend on the
same atmosphere and the same water; that we - like all of the physical universe
- are inescapably linked at a quantum mechanical level; and even that we
are more closely linked mentally than we usually acknowledge.<BR>
<BR>
If we are interconnected in these ways, then our full <I>self </I>extends
beyond the boundaries of our skin. In a culture based on a deep understanding
of such interconnectedness, individuals would be as loathe to hurt their
neighbor, or the ecosystem, as we are now loathe to stub our toe. Behaviors
and institutions for the common good that now are maintained through the
dubious means of moral persuasion, guilt, and (at times) force would become
self-evident and natural. It is just the sort of thing that this suffering
planet needs its humans to wake up to.<BR>
<BR>
Philosophically, <I>interconnectedness </I>stands in opposition to <I>separateness
</I>- the idea that we are each isolated, sovereign, and self-contained.
Since most of the distinctive institutions of western civilization - materialistic
science, market economics, our legal system, the Bill of Rights - are based
on the assumption that the world is composed of discrete units, the idea
of interconnectedness rattles the foundations of our whole society.<BR>
<BR>
It is not surprising, then, that our society has generally denied or ignored
evidence for interconnectedness. Nevertheless, that evidence has been growing
in many disciplines throughout the 20th century. Moreover, while a world
view based on separateness may have served us well in the past, it is flunking
the test of this crucial period at the turn of the millennium. Increasingly,
many are finding that an interconnected world view has more to offer.<BR>
<BR>
If this momentum keeps building, our society will face a major challenge
in coming to grips with this new world view. What shall we do if the &quot;great
truth&quot; of separateness fails us? Do we simply abandon it, or do we
look for a larger truth that can encompass the remaining value of separateness
while transcending its limitations?<BR>
<BR>
An example of moving to a larger truth while retaining useful elements of
the old can be found in the transition, in the beginning of the 20th century,
from Newtonian physics to quantum and relativistic physics. Although it
became clear that Newtonian physics does not provide an accurate view of
reality, its tools continue to function as a useful approximation for many
activities, such as building bridges.<BR>
<BR>
This transition also provides an especially helpful metaphor in the way
it changed our ideas about &quot;particle&quot; and &quot;wave.&quot;
<H4><BR>
THE PARTICLE-WAVE METAPHOR</H4>
In Newtonian physics, particles - like billiard balls - were seen as hard,
individual objects, specific to a particular space and time. On the other
hand waves - such as ocean waves or sound waves - were spread through space
and time, blending and interpenetrating with each other. The two, particles
and waves, were seen as completely different concepts.<BR>
<BR>
This common-sense notion got turned on it head by quantum physics, which
developed at the beginning of this century to account for the behavior of
atoms and light. What was found then - and has since been confirmed by almost
a century's worth of experimentation - is that the basic building blocks
of the physical world (such as atoms, electrons, protons, light) behave
in some situations like waves and in other situations like particles. The
inescapable result is that in some mysterious way, they are both.<BR>
<BR>
Might we humans also, in some mysterious way, have both particle-like individuality
and a wave-like shared beingness and interconnectedness? Western cultures
have emphasized the particle-like side; other cultures have emphasized the
wave-like side. The appropriate synthesis may encompasses both.<BR>
<BR>
To explore this synthesis, those of us from the West first need to stretch
our ability to understand our more wave-like, interconnected qualities.
The goal in doing so is not to swing the pendulum; rather it is to broaden
our understanding to a broader, more encompassing, and hopefully more mature
level of self knowledge.
<H4><BR>
HOW INTERCONNECTED ARE WE?</H4>
To help with this exploration, I'd like to briefly review a few of the more
philosophically significant ways that, according to the best scientific
evidence available, we are interconnected both at a physical level and at
the level of consciousness.<B><I><BR>
<BR>
The Physics Of Interconnectedness</I></B><I> </I>* As a former astrophysicist,
I can't resist beginning with the big picture. One of the most remarkable
things astronomers have found as they have looked ever farther out in space
(and thus also further back in time) is that the laws of physics that apply
here on earth also apply, as far as we can tell, <I>everywhere</I> else
we have looked. There is no &quot;diversity of physics&quot; across the
universe in the way that there is a diversity of human cultures around the
world.<BR>
<BR>
In the micro-world of quantum physics, the most dramatic demonstration of
interconnectedness is described by Bell's theorem. In 1964, John Bell showed
that quantum theory predicted that any two particles that originated from
a single source (such as two electrons born out of an energetic collision),
would later behave as if they maintained some kind of on-going non-local
connection. This connection can be revealed by measuring some property of
each particle, such as the spin of each electron. It is instantaneous and
unaffected by time or distance. According to Bell, these measurements should
be more highly correlated than if the two particles were truly separate.
Many experiments have now confirmed Bell's prediction.<BR>
<BR>
The implications of this are profound, since all matter comes from essentially
a single source - the Big Bang. Thus Bell's theorem implies, at a quantum
level, that the physical world is an inseparable whole. The old Newtonian
idea that world is made up of separate objects that occasionally collide,
but otherwise lead independent existences, turns out to be only a convenient
approximation, applicable in only some situations.<B><I><BR>
<BR>
The Interconnection of Consciousness</I></B><I> </I>* The physical interconnectedness
I've just been describing has two characteristics: it's based on widely
accepted science and it doesn't touch our core sense of individuality. When
we look at interconnectedness at the level of consciousness, both these
characteristics change.<BR>
<BR>
For many decades parapsychologists have studied the various ways that one
person's mind might influence another person's mind, or influence physical
objects or events, without the aid of normal communications. Most of these
studies have concluded that there <I>is</I> some form of interconnection,
but because of the profound philosophical and social implications of this
result, the overall scientific community has resisted accepting the conclusions
of these studies. <BR>
<BR>
In response, the parapsychologists have kept refining their experiments
and accumulating evidence that is harder and harder to refute. My own sense
is that if this were any other topic, the available scientific evidence
would have settled the question by now.<BR>
<BR>
What is that evidence? One standard experimental setup involves placing
two people, a &quot;sender&quot; and a &quot;receiver,&quot; in two separate
rooms, where each room is shielded for sound, light, and electro-magnetic
radiation. Once placed in these rooms, the sender then focuses his or her
attention on a randomly selected item, and the receiver, in some way, responds.
The experiments are designed to measure and test the accuracy of these responses,
looking to see if they could be explained purely by chance.<BR>
<BR>
A good example is reported by Honorton et al. in the June 1990 issue of
the <I>Journal of Parapsychology</I> . In their experiment, the sender views
a randomly selected picture (either moving or still), and the receiver then
chooses, among four pictures (the one viewed by the sender plus three randomly
selected decoys), the one that most closely matches what the receiver sensed.<BR>
<BR>
This experiment incorporates an important procedure. The receiver is put
into a state of mild sensory deprivation, called <I>ganzfeld</I>, through
reclining comfortably, listening to white noise, and viewing, through translucent
eye covers, a uniform red light. This procedure generally induces drowsiness,
vivid imagery, and a sense of disconnection from the immediate sensory environment.
These characteristics have been found to improve the sensitivity of the
receiver.<BR>
<BR>
The full experimental series involved 241 participants in 355 sessions.
The overall success rate was 34 percent, significantly better than the 25
percent that would result by chance. The success rate for moving images
alone was even higher, at 40 percent.<BR>
<BR>
These results are typical of well-done experiments of this type in that
they show 1) a statistically significant positive result (suggesting there
is a real phenomenon), and 2) a success rate that is far from 100 percent
(suggesting the receiver is influenced by more than the sender).<BR>
<BR>
Another similar series of experiments has tested the ability of the sender
to affect the physiological activity of the receiver - biofeedback at a
distance - thus bypassing the need for reportage or interpretation by the
receiver. For example, the receiver's blood pressure is automatically recorded
during a 20-minute session. At randomly selected times during that period,
the sender attempts to raise (or lower) the receiver's blood pressure, while
at other times avoiding any such attempt. The results are positive and statistically
significant at a level similar to those for the imagery experiment described
above.<BR>
<BR>
Can we also, through conscious intention, affect physical objects? Here
again, the answer appears to be yes. The best experimental studies involve
effects on otherwise random events. A typical setup has a human sender attempt
to influence the output of an electronic random number generator. The Princeton
Engineering Anomalies Research Laboratory at Princeton University has been
doing experiments of this type for more than a decade. Their procedure has
the sender alternate between attempting to get the random number generator
to give a higher-than-chance result, a lower-than-chance result, and then
not influencing the machine at all. The resulting deviations are small,
less than 1 percent on average, but still statistically significant. These
positive results are unaffected by the construction details of the random
number generator or by the distance between the sender and the machine,
up to thousands of miles.<BR>
<BR>
Are these results genuine? The best that one can say about any set of experiments
is that they are well-designed by current standards and that others have
replicated their results. The Princeton experiments pass both of these tests.<BR>
<BR>
Taken together with many other well-done experiments, all these results
strongly suggest that as humans:
<UL>
  <LI>We can mentally influence - and are influenced by - the thoughts of
others.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>We can mentally influence biological processes in bodies other than
our own.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>We can mentally influence the functioning of non-biological systems.
</UL>
<BR>
How do we do it? There are dozens of rival explanations, some modern and
some thousands of years old, but as yet there is no generally established
theory, even among parapsychologists.<BR>
<BR>
One thing is getting clearer, however. Certain psychological conditions
are more conducive than others to gaining access to this kind of interconnection,
as the use of the <I>ganzfeld </I>procedure described above suggests. William
Braud, the parapsychologist who did the blood-pressure experiment, describes
the five simple yet powerful mental techniques that he has found to be most
effective as follows: relaxation and quietude; focused attention; imagery
and visualization; confident yet effortless intentionality; and self-evoked
positive emotions.
<H4><BR>
WHY DO WE DENY OUR INTERCONNECTEDNESS?</H4>
The suggestion that we are mentally interconnected in these ways raises
passionate objections from many in the sciences, and from many others as
well. If the experimental results are accurate, these objections will eventually
need to be addressed. Even if the results are not accurate, the passion
of the objections provides an interesting window on our culture's attachment
to individualism and separateness. In either case, we have a lot to learn
from exploring the roots of these objections.<BR>
<BR>
To understand these roots, I find it helpful to go back to the cultural
context surrounding the birth of western natural science in the 17th century.
In the previous centuries, the simple world of the Middle Ages was progressively
being replaced by a more diverse and contentious world. The Crusades (11th
to 14th centuries) and the Age of Exploration (15th and 16th centuries)
had opened Europe to a larger world and brought it into violent conflict
with other religions. The Black Death (14th century), in which perhaps as
much as half of the population of Europe died, had shaken popular faith
and traumatized the society. The Roman Catholic Church's Inquisition, started
in the 13th century and still in full swing during the 17th century, was
responsible for the death of millions accused of heresy and witchcraft.
The Renaissance (14th to 16th centuries) had raised the level of education,
reintroduced Greek and Roman literature to Europe, and encouraged individual
expression and achievement - further threatening the status quo. The Reformation
(16th century) broke the monopoly of the Roman Catholic Church and increased
concerns about heresy.<BR>
<BR>
In this context, there were those who wanted to develop science out of the
more wholistic and organic worldview of the earlier Middle Ages, but they
lost out to those like Francis Bacon (who lived from 1561 to 1626) and Ren&eacute;
Descartes (1596 to 1650) who argued for a mechanistic and atomized approach.
The mechanistic approach had two significant advantages:
<UL>
  <LI>It simplified the development of practical results. More than anyone
could have initially imagined, there were a vast number of practical problems
that could be addressed with this strategy. Newton's (1643 to 1727) formulation
of general laws of motion and gravitation within this mechanistic framework
cemented it success.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>It minimized, as much as possible, any spiritual implications and
was thus best able to avoid persecution for heresy. Not that these early
scientist avoided persecution entirely, but they survived much better than
their competitors with a more mystical bent.
</UL>
<BR>
The dangerous and often bitter struggle of these early scientists with the
Church and with other philosophic schools left a profound impact on their
successors. To this day, even though the historical justifications are long
gone, those who enter the sub-culture of science soon learn that nothing
is so damaging to one's credibility as the accusation that one is interpreting
phenomena in anything other than mechanistic terms, especially in any way
that might be construed as giving consciousness a significant role in the
dynamics of the natural world. Quantum physics has forced some physicists
to break with this taboo, but most of those in the biological, psychological,
and social sciences still keep the faith.<BR>
<BR>
There are a number of additional reasons why many people - not only those
from the sciences - resist the idea that our minds might have the capabilities
described above:
<UL>
  <LI>There is a long and well-publicized history of people using the claim
of these capabilities in manipulative and fraudulent ways (including those
claiming to be mind readers, channelers, spiritual teachers, and others).
This guilt by association produces understandable reluctance to be taken
in. The irony is that discouraging legitimate research and development of
these capabilities makes these phenomena more easily subject to abuse. <BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Accepting these capabilities would entail accepting such things as
imagery and intuition as valid channels for information about the larger
world. In effect, we would be adding the mind as a legitimate <I>sense </I>along
side vision, hearing, etc. Since knowledge is power, and since people vary
considerably in their current facility for using the mind in this way, such
an acceptance would significantly rearrange the power relationship throughout
the society. <BR>
<BR>
  <LI>The personality skills that are helpful in developing these capabilities
(quietude, visualization, confident yet effortless intentionality, etc.)
run counter to the skills (striving, verbal and analytic thinking, etc.)
that our society encourages as the route to success. Those who have invested
heavily in the traditional route, and perhaps along the way learned to suppress
the other skills, are understandably loathe to see the primacy of their
strengths challenged.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Wrapped up in all this are issues of gender relations. Regardless
of how accurate the associations may be, our culture has for centuries described
the more effortful, analytic, and mechanical approach as masculine, and
the more intuitive, receptive, and organic approach as feminine. Any affirmation
of the value of the more &quot;feminine&quot; approach would have reverberations
throughout the culture.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>These capabilities raise concerns about the loss of privacy and even
identity in a world where minds are open to each other. Many feel it is
better to keep the social contract that denies this openness - even if it
is real - than to face it directly.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Even those who accept these phenomena as real may - in light of what
has happened with modern technology - fear that intentional development
of these capabilities could lead to more harm than good.
</UL>
<BR>
Looking over this list of objections, I'm struck by the way that some of
the most powerful resistance to an even-handed assessment of our interconnectedness
has been weakened by on-going cultural trends:<BR>
<UL>
  <LI>The authority of materialist science has been diminished by such things
as the pervasive environmental damage and the threats from toxics and radioactivity
that the public associates with this kind of science.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Mental skills like intuition and visualization are increasingly seen
as useful and legitimate, even within business settings.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Anti-feminine attitudes are now more quickly recognized as such, and
the social support for them has been considerably diminished.
</UL>
<BR>
The combination of these trends with the steady improvement in the quality
and breadth of empirical evidence for interconnectedness is what leads me
to say that the momentum of history is gathering toward a major shift in
public and official attitudes towards all the aspects of interconnectedness
described above. Of course, history is full of surprises, and something
may happen to change these trends, but if they keep going as they have been
for the past few decades, I would expect this shift in attitude to become
apparent in this decade, perhaps even in the next few years, just as the
shift in attitude towards issues of sustainability has become apparent in
the past four years.<BR>
<BR>
Many will simply cheer such a shift. I share some of that sentiment, yet
my reaction is more complex, for I share or sympathize with some of the
concerns listed above as well. If this shift is to be as graceful and positive
as possible, these concerns need to be addressed, and, given the momentum
building towards this shift, it is none too soon to start actively addressing
them.<BR>
<BR>
Here is what I propose:<BR>
<UL>
  <LI>Woven through many of these concerns is a sense of conflict between
the concepts of interconnectedness and individuality (and especially between
the proponents of these two!). Yet in practice they function much more as
complements. The particle-wave metaphor can be fruitfully used to emphasize
this complementarity.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Underlying many of these concerns is a simple fear of the unknown.
We need to familiarize ourselves with the reality of interconnectedness,
rather than reacting to its caricatures. Among other things, this means
1) raising our awareness of our physical and biological interconnectedness
(see <A HREF="Hill.htm">&quot;Common As Dirt&quot;</A> and <A HREF="Margulis.htm">&quot;Microbal
Microcosm&quot;</A>), 2) learning how cultures that are much more comfortable
with interconnectedness have dealt with those things that concern us (see
<A HREF="Macy.htm">&quot;World As Lover; World As Self&quot;</A> and <A HREF="Some.htm">&quot;Remembering
Our Purpose&quot;</A>), and 3) learning from those pioneers of interconnectedness
within our own culture who are working on a balanced integration of it in
their own lives (see pages <A HREF="Spangler.htm">&quot;Between Order and
Chaos&quot;</A> and <A HREF="Abdullah.htm">&quot;The Song&quot;</A>).<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>There are ways in which concerns about the kind of interconnectedness
described here are, in effect, stand-ins for concerns about maintaining
our own identity and dignity. Our fears around identity and dignity fuel
conflicts between religions, cultures, ethnic groups, and the genders. Easing
these conflicts will have the additional benefit of making it easier to
deal with interconnectedness in a balanced way (see <A HREF="Jakic.htm">&quot;A
Chance for Peace&quot;</A>, <A HREF="Parry.htm">&quot;Essential Peacemaking,
Women and Men&quot;</A>, <A HREF="Holland.htm">&quot;Planetary Networking
for Kids&quot;</A>, <A HREF="Wimsatt.htm">&quot;Hip-Hoppers &amp; Do-Gooders&quot;</A>,
and <A HREF="Piedmont.htm">&quot;Sharing Strength&quot;</A>).<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>We need to begin the work of reframing our sense of self so that it
can be more inclusive without losing the values of particulate individuality
(see &quot;<A HREF="Roszak.htm">Awakening the Ecological Unconscious</A>&quot;).
